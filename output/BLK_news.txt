Institutional investors such as mutual funds, pension funds, and exchange traded funds (ETFs) play a prominent role in today’s economy. According to the CFA Institute, institutional investors now hold over $70 trillion in investable assets and thus wield immense influence over the corporations they invest in. But how do these institutions actually exercise their power? The most nuanced and direct way for investors to interact with their portfolio firms is through shareholder engagement, where they communicate with corporate managers to share their perspective, suggest changes, or gather information. In a new study, we quantify the costs, benefits, and economy-wide impact of engagement by some of the largest institutional investors in the world. Engagement activities range from writing letters to CEOs and joining meetings to pressing for better governance or environmental practices. Unlike voting or selling shares, engagement is a private dialogue, making it a less-easily observed but potentially more powerful and nuanced tool. By addressing issues directly with corporate leaders, investors aim to improve company performance – and, in turn, the value of their investments. The institutions in our sample each employs a dedicated stewardship team that engages with hundreds or even thousands of portfolio firms every year. Despite its importance, we know surprisingly little about the economics of engagement. How much does it cost? What are the benefits? How much value does it create? Using novel data on investor engagement drawn from the yearly stewardship reports of eleven large institutional investors including BlackRock, Vanguard, State Street, and T. Rowe Price, we quantify these economic forces for the first time. We find that institutional investors act as if spending $10,000 on engagement increases a company’s value by 0.3 basis points (bps), or 0.003 percent, on average. While that may sound small, when scaled by trillions of dollars in market capitalization and assets under management, the potential benefits are significant. However, engagement isn’t free; the stewardship team requires significant resources to research the issues and conduct meetings with corporate leaders. We find that both the costs and benefits vary depending on the firm being engaged. Smaller companies are slightly more expensive to engage with but offer much higher returns on engagement, an average 5.5 basis point expected increase in firm value. Yet institutional investors engage less with smaller firms because they hold smaller positions in those firms, limiting the potential payoff. We also find that engagement costs are higher for firms with entrenched management, where presumably resistance from leadership makes it harder to drive change. The economics of engagement also depend on the type of fund that is engaging. Active funds – those that try to outperform the market by actively picking stocks – are more likely to engage than index funds, which simply aim to match the performance of an index like the S&P 500. Surprisingly, this difference isn’t because active funds are inherently better at engagement. In fact, we find that active and index funds create equal amounts of expected value when they engage. Rather, it’s a question of incentives. Index funds charge lower fees, meaning they capture a smaller share of the value created through engagement. As a result, despite their larger positions and more diversified holdings, they engage less. Yet as passive investing continues to dominate the market, the role of these funds in engagement is becoming more pronounced. Index funds tend to hold larger stakes in companies simply because they track broad indices, which increases their potential to create value when they do engage. Using simulations, we examined what would happen if passive investing continued to grow, reaching 90 percent of all mutual fund assets. We find that index funds would engage more often, driven by their even larger holdings, and generate substantial value for both their investors and society. Our estimates suggest that index funds have flat economies of scale: Tracking an index does not become more difficult as the fund grows. As a result, the continuing rise of passive investing increases the total societal benefits of their engagement. On the other hand, our estimates show that active investors face diseconomies of scale that limit their effectiveness as they grow. As an actively managed fund attracts more resources, it becomes harder to identify and act on profitable opportunities that move the needle. As Warren Buffett once said, “Anyone who says that size does not hurt investment performance is selling. The highest rates of return I’ve ever achieved were in the 1950s. I killed the Dow. You ought to see the numbers. But I was investing peanuts then. It’s a huge structural advantage not to have a lot of money.” Smaller active funds can engage more selectively and effectively. In our simulations, active funds actually create more value for society when they shrink. At the same time, active fund managers and investors certainly don’t want their funds to shrink, and we might expect them to fight this trend, for example by lowering their fees or introducing new active investing options. Our findings add new dimensions to the debate about the future of investing and corporate governance. Engagement clearly has the potential to create significant value, but its benefits are unevenly distributed. Index funds, with their flat economies of scale, may increasingly fill the gap left by shrinking active funds, creating a system where the societal value of engagement could rise even if the payoff to individual funds and investors are smaller. The study also highlights the challenges of aligning private incentives with social benefits. While active funds are more motivated to engage under current fee structures, index funds generate broader social gains as they grow. This mismatch creates a tension between what’s best for active fund managers and their investors and what’s best for the economy as a whole. More broadly, our findings imply that engagement is a relatively hidden but powerful tool for increasing firm value – one that benefits not just large institutions, but the broader economy, too. As the balance between active and passive investing shifts, so will the dynamics of how institutional investors engage with the companies they own. This post comes to us from professors Davidson Heath at the University of Utah’s David Eccles School of Business, Daniele Macciocchi at the University of Miami’s Herbert Business School, and Matthew C. Ringgenberg at the University of Utah. It is based on their recent article, “The Economics of Investor Engagement,” available here. Your email address will not be published.

Title: Introducing Nirvana V2: Here's What You Need to Know | HackerNoon
URL: https://hackernoon.com/introducing-nirvana-v2-heres-what-you-need-to-know
Time Published: 2024-12-18T04:03:07Z

The Nirvana protocol has one mission: to produce a truly resilient store of value. One that holds its worth regardless of market cycles, evolves without central planning, and scales indefinitely. Without these three legs to the stool, an asset’s value will only ever be temporary. Nirvana builds on the open and algorithmic nature of decentralized finance to create an entirely new class of asset that meets the promise of this new paradigm we call “DeFi”. In a word: Nirvana’s store of value – ANA – could very well be the most “cryptonative” of all assets on offer. It takes the principles of crypto and blockchain seriously – almost fanatically – and encodes them into its DNA. It is not controversial to note that crypto (and especially DeFi) has been going through a rough, prolonged puberty. The sector has been stuck in the awkward phase of being half “decentralized” and half “traditional”, half “democratic” while half manipulated by cabals of ultra-wealthy insiders. The goal was trustless, open, algorithmic systems, but the reality has been a messy blend of old-fashioned problems with new-fashioned aspirations. Crypto caught on because it promised to create an asset that is resilient, decentralized, and scalable. Nirvana’s purpose is to bring this vision finally to reality. Let’s take these three pillars one at a time. The hope for Bitcoin is that it becomes “digital gold” – that is, a “safe haven” asset that holds its value with a rock-hard grip. So far, this remains just hope. The annualized volatility of Bitcoin has been 4-9 times greater than gold’s, and it is anyone’s guess where the roller coaster goes next. The problem is not Bitcoin’s fault. It is that Bitcoin’s technology is not of the same ilk as its market. Its ledger is famously tamper-resistant, but its market is only human, and sometimes, humans decide to rotate out liquidity. This fact will never change. Bitcoin’s price has nothing to do with blockchain technology, and the value that Bitcoin stores has much to do with the convictions of Michael Saylor and Blackrock. We should go one step further with digital assets. Nirvana’s key insight is: make the market algorithmic too. If the liquidity for the asset is deterministic, and the humans are left out of the equation, then we can guarantee value for a token with the same mathematical precision that we guarantee its supply. Yes, Bitcoin guarantees that the supply will stop at 21 million – but what if it could guarantee that its price will never go below, say, $70k? Nirvana does. Nirvana’s ANA token has a hard floor price, guaranteed at the protocol level. This price cannot be breached because the mathematical rules of the Nirvana market ensure that every ANA token in supply can be sold back to the protocol at this floor price. But why stop there? The floor price for ANA also rises. It rises automatically with demand for ANA and follows the price of ANA upward. Every time the floor ratchets up, the intrinsic value of ANA gets locked in forever. The more expensive ANA becomes, the higher the floor price becomes, and the greater amount of value gets permanently stored in each token. We can do better than “digital gold”. After all, the price of physical gold has no bottom. When we make the market and liquidity itself algorithmic, we have an entirely new kind of asset that has truly guaranteed value. The price of ANA may go up and down, but it can only go down so far as its current floor allows. One remarkable goal of crypto protocols is to be everlasting. They should continue to live long, healthy lives even if the founder disappears. After all, they are just code. But the original creator is not infallible, and protocols need to adapt after inception to survive. It is not viable to freeze the code once, and never touch it again. The truth is that all major DeFi teams make changes to their programs, big and small, all the time. The founders must operate their business as businesspeople would, and it is an open secret that a great many attempts at decentralized governance turn out to be theater in practice. There is another path. Nirvana’s governance is simple, deterministic, and mechanical – just like its market. The first and most important step in liberating governance from central authority is zero “team allocation” of governance power. With Nirvana, everyone is on equal footing on Day 1. There are no governance tokens held back in insider wallets, put on vesting schedules, or pre-sold in dark OTC markets. Remember: when a team “airdrops” its governance token, but keeps 80% of the supply in reserve for its own stewardship, this is oligarchy, not democracy. The second step is to embed the governance process in the automated, immutable code of the contract. The code itself is like a Constitution document for the protocol – it sets the rules for how governance functions and makes affects on the program. All that can happen is users participate in governance according to those indelible rules. The method for governing Nirvana is simple. Every mutable parameter of the protocol is a number, and this number can be nudged in one direction or the other every week, according to a programmatic ballot. This elegant system gives full control over the token holders to steer the protocol gradually, without the need for any central committee with admin access. Nirvana gives control of the protocol to the rational, economic incentives of its participants. And by doing so, ensures that the protocol will endure, evolve, and adapt regardless of any one human’s involvement. DeFi broke down barriers. All you need is a connection to the internet in order to participate. But most, if not all, crypto assets buckle under the weight of massive adoption and ultimately break. They cannot truly scale as useful stores of value for hundreds of millions of individuals simply because too much of the supply is overly concentrated among those who got in early. Concentration can be good for price, but it is bad for liquidity. The key to making an asset scalable is that it becomes more liquid as it becomes more valuable. The status quo among crypto assets is unfortunately the opposite. The common playbook for tokens is to restrain supply, and thereby reduce liquidity and increase volatility, in the hope of price appreciation. Needless to say, low liquidity cuts both ways. And the brief history of crypto markets has already experienced numerous liquidity crises where panic selling seemed like the only option. The ANA token is paradigmatically different. It scales indefinitely, meaning there is no cap on supply, but it is also never printed out of thin air. Every ANA token exists strictly because someone paid for it. And when that someone bought it, they also increased its liquidity – that is, they extended the sell depth. With this one move, Nirvana turns the presumed negative relation between supply and price on its head. The prevailing myth is that a greater supply implies a lower value, but with ANA its supply and its value are positively correlated. More ANA means more liquidity and value for ANA. There is no cap on the supply for ANA because there is no cap on the value of ANA. These two properties are combined in the mathematics of the Nirvana market. ANA will become as plentiful and valuable as its holders want, and the floor price will rise at pace. But even if the circulating supply and price explode, illiquidity is not a problem ANA will ever face since the floor price is guaranteed for all tokens. Panic selling is not rational in this system. And even if a spurt of irrational selling does occur, it will never move the price beneath its floor. There is no reason to rush to the exit. Nirvana’s store of value is one that can be held securely by everyone because the market liquidity is maintained by no one. It scales automatically with adoption. Crypto ignited the imagination of a generation with its dream to produce an asset that is fair, open, and, in some real sense, permanent. Nirvana embodies this ideal by infusing cryptonative principles into every aspect of the protocol, including the price and liquidity of its asset. ANA is a “pure” cryptonative store of value. The market is cryptonative, the governance is cryptonative, and the scale is unlimited. The protocol truly steers itself and the market truly makes itself because the only power that has influence over either comes from the organic, anonymous users that participate in them. The value that ANA accrues comes from genuine market demand, and the value that ANA stores is guaranteed by the protocol’s floor price. About Nirvana Founded by a distributed team of DeFi veterans with deep roots in the Solana ecosystem, Nirvana is on a mission to redefine token markets and elevate the decentralized finance landscape. With the relaunch of Nirvana V2, the team reaffirms its commitment to building secure, transparent, and equitable financial systems for all.

Title: Why Is 3M Company (MMM) Among the Best Conglomerate Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Conglomerate Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) stands against the other conglomerate stocks. As per Lloyd Capital, the new year starts on the back of economic resilience. Global conditions remain benign, courtesy of a healthy US economy, moderating inflation, and a gradual easing of global monetary policy. However, investors are required to remain cognizant of the several risks looming. Notably, governments worldwide have fueled economic activity in a way that has deteriorated fiscal positions. Also, inflation is yet to fully return to the respective targeted levels and the geopolitical situation remains uncertain. As per the investment management firm, investors are required to remain focused on analyzing the quality of the businesses they purchase and ensuring that these are done at prices offering an adequate margin of safety relative to intrinsic value. As per BofA's equity strategy team, led by Savita Subramanian, the S&P 500 index should reach 6,666 by 2025 end. Part of this growth is expected to stem from healthy economic growth. The investment firm's economics team expects that the US economy should grow at an annualized rate of 2.4% in 2025, higher than Bloomberg consensus forecasts of 2% growth. As a result, the firm has favored companies that are GDP-sensitive and is now going overweight on Financials, Consumer Discretionary, and Real Estate, among others. Bank of America went on to add that, in 2025, there will be a broadening out of the stock market rally from the "Mag 7" tech stocks to other 493 stocks of the S&P 500 Index. J.P. Morgan also has somewhat similar expectations. Let’s look at that in detail. READ ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In. J.P. Morgan believes that equity earnings should broaden moving forward. Equity returns were dominated by "Mag 7" since the beginning of 2023. Over that period, the broader market (S&P 500 index) managed to return 62%, more than half of which was made by Magnificent 7 (delivering 242% over the same period). The strong returns have a solid backing as the Mag 7 were able to grow their earnings at 40%, and the remaining 493 stocks in the index were able to post 2%. However, J.P. Morgan expects that performance is expected to broaden in 2025 as the remaining "493 stocks" should be able to more than 5 times their earnings growth to 13% in 2025. Therefore, Wall Street analysts believe that investing in companies having a diversified presence should deliver healthy returns in contrast to pure-play (sector-specific) investments. The wealth management firm believes that reduced interest rates, renormalization of inventories and production, and easier comparables are expected to act as potential tailwinds for the cohort over the next year. Analysts are bullish on businesses with multiple revenue streams and one group that gives investors a diversification advantage is conglomerates. With this in mind, let us now have a look at the 10 Best Conglomerate Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. Our Methodology To list the 10 Best Conglomerate Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds, we used a screener and online rankings. After getting an initial list of 20-25 stocks, we selected the ones having high hedge fund holdings. Finally, the stocks were ranked in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiments, as of Q3 2024. At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A specialized industrial laboratory, filled with high-tech machinery for producing abrasives. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 82 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) offers diversified technology services in the US and internationally. 3M Company (NYSE:MMM)’s delivered a YTD return of more than ~40%, courtesy of the appointment of a new CEO and implementation of strategic initiatives. The new leadership plans to focus on 3 main areas: driving sustained organic growth, improving operational performance, and effective capital deployment. 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) targets to revitalize its R&D efforts to align organic growth with global GDP growth rates. By doing this, the company should regain its innovation edge and capture new market opportunities. The new CEO’s emphasis on operational execution improvements throughout various areas including facility rationalization and distribution network optimization should unlock significant cost savings and efficiency gains. These initiatives are expected to fuel margin expansion and improve cash flow generation. Wall Street expects 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) to achieve adjusted operating margins in the mid-20s range. This expansion is expected to stem from self-help measures, such as cost structure optimization, salesforce restructuring, and facility rationalization. 3M Company (NYSE:MMM)’s strong emphasis on distribution network optimization should result in improved supply chain efficiency and reduced costs, supporting margin expansion. As per Wall Street, with the appointment of a new CEO and the implementation of strategic initiatives, 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) should see a potential turnaround. Analysts at UBS Group raised shares of the company from a “Neutral” rating to a “Buy” rating, increasing the target price from $130.00 to $184.00 on 13th November. Overall MMM ranks 1st on our list of the best conglomerate stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of MMM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than MMM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

CVX's unit signs a long-term gas deal with Alcoa, providing 130 petajoules over 10 years supporting Western Australia's energy infrastructure. Ginkgo Bioworks (DNA) has been upgraded to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), reflecting growing optimism about the company's earnings prospects. This might drive the stock higher in the near term. Minutes released today of last week’s meeting, when the bank raised the Selic rate to 12.25% from 11.25%, say that: “The combination of a robust labor market, expansionary fiscal policy, and vigorous broad credit granting continue to support consumption and, consequently, aggregate demand.” 1320 ET – The Canadian dollar weakens Tuesday, nearing a nine-year low, amid a slowdown in total inflation and concerns about PM Justin Trudeau’s ability to deal with economic challenges amid a sudden political crisis. The Canadian dollar last traded at that level, relative to USD, in January 2016. The S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) has long been the benchmark of performance for many investors. Because it comprises the 500 largest stocks listed on the U.S. index, it tracks companies from multiple industries, giving investors a good feel for how the overall market is doing. The market has been incredibly strong during the past two years, as it has returned more 20% (assuming the 2024 returns -- now about 27% -- hold up to finish the year). Stocks eyed a rebound Wednesday, with the blue-chip Dow looking to snap its longest losing streak since 1978 ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) has become a cash-gushing machine in recent years. The oil giant delivered industry-leading cash flow from operations of $17.6 million during the third quarter. The oil company could produce an even bigger cash flow gusher in the coming years. Which of these speculative energy plays has a brighter future? Microsoft is having an excellent month so far, holding on to a 6.6% gain after Monday's action. According to IBD Stock Checkup, Mr. Softy has seen steady improvement in the Composite Rating to a much improved 82 on a scale of 1 to 99. While one would prefer to see a Composite score of 90 or higher, Microsoft stock ranks 1st in this metric within the desktop software industry group. Market leaders of next-big-thing trends are known for their parabolic climbs -- as well as their inevitable retracements. Sign in to access your portfolio

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 55 Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON) is a diversified technology and manufacturing powerhouse. Wall Street believes that Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON)’s long-term growth should be driven by a commercial agreement with Bombardier, which is a leading manufacturer of business jets. This alliance includes using Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON)’s avionics and engines in Bombardier's aircraft fleet, which should act as a significant opportunity. The agreement should generate ~$17 billion in lifetime revenue opportunities for Honeywell, further strengthening the potential long-term benefits of this alliance. These revenue opportunities indicate a promising growth trajectory for Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON)’s aerospace segment. Apart from securing a steady revenue stream, it strengthens Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON)’s position as a leading supplier of avionics and engine technologies for business jets.

Title: Why Bitwise Strategist Juan Leon Calls Ethereum ($ETH) ‘The Comeback Kid of 2025’
URL: https://www.cryptoglobe.com/latest/2024/12/why-bitwise-strategist-juan-leon-calls-ethereum-eth-the-comeback-kid-of-2025/
Time Published: 2024-12-17T21:31:51Z
Full Content:
Juan Leon, senior investment strategist at Bitwise Asset Management, believes Ethereum is primed for a significant resurgence in 2025. In a blog post published Dec. 17, Leon argues that Ethereum, despite being overshadowed in 2024, stands to gain tremendously from the $100 trillion market for real-world assets. Leon says that while Bitcoin and Solana dominated headlines this year, Ethereum remained largely overlooked. He points out that Bitcoin surged on the back of spot Bitcoin ETFs and historic capital inflows, posting a 130% year-to-date return, while Solana, buoyed by retail-driven meme coin speculation, delivered a 106% gain. In comparison, he says, Ethereum’s 66% year-to-date return seemed lackluster. However, Leon points to a pivotal shift occurring in recent weeks. According to Leon, over the past 10 days, spot Ethereum ETFs have attracted $2 billion in net inflows, a stark contrast to the $250 million recorded over the preceding four months. Leon attributes this to renewed investor confidence in Ethereum. Leon credits Ethereum’s role as the dominant platform for tokenizing real-world assets as a driving factor behind its comeback. He believes that tokenization—the process of digitizing traditional financial assets like Treasury bills and real estate—represents a massive opportunity. By enabling faster, cheaper and more efficient transactions on blockchain networks, Leon suggests tokenization could transform global financial markets. Leon emphasizes that this is not a distant concept but an active trend gaining momentum today. Major financial institutions such as BlackRock and UBS are already bringing tokenized real-world assets on-chain, spanning government securities, commodities, real estate and private equity. For instance, BlackRock operates a $578 million tokenized Treasury fund, and Leon predicts tokenized fund assets will triple in 2025, with Ethereum at the center of this expansion. Leon explains Ethereum’s dominance in this space by citing its unmatched security, decentralization and track record. He argues that since launching in 2015, Ethereum has established itself as the most trusted platform for decentralized applications and smart contracts. Leon adds that Ethereum holds 81% of the market share in tokenized assets, which makes it the platform most asset managers prefer to use. Leon describes Ethereum as a safe and reliable choice for developers and institutions due to its proven infrastructure and expansive validator network. This stability, he suggests, encourages confidence for those looking to move real-world assets onto blockchain rails. Leon underscores the enormous size of the real-world asset market, estimated at $100 trillion globally. While he notes that shifting these assets to blockchain platforms will take time, he predicts fees generated from tokenized real-world assets could eventually surpass $100 billion annually. This amount would be more than 40 times Ethereum’s current year-to-date fees of $2.4 billion. Leon adds that greater regulatory clarity—particularly with a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that supports pro-crypto policies—could accelerate this shift. He believes favorable regulations would make Ethereum an attractive investment opportunity with substantial potential rewards. Leon identifies tokenization as one of the primary drivers of Ethereum’s resurgence. Combined with other growing trends, such as the increasing use of stablecoins and AI agents engaging in crypto transactions, Leon sees Ethereum’s central role in tokenizing real-world assets as a major opportunity for growth in 2025.

Title: Jim Cramer on NIKE, Inc. (NKE): ‘It’s Amazing How Much Damage The Previous CEO Did To This Once Unassailable Brand’

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer's Game Plan for This Week: 8 Stocks in Focus. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) stands against the other stocks featured in Jim Cramer's game plan. Jim Cramer, host of Mad Money, provided insights on Friday about this week's Federal Reserve meeting, key earnings reports, and the retail sales numbers due to be released. According to Cramer, the market is in a holding pattern at the moment, with investors growing increasingly uneasy. "When the market bides its time, guess what, people tend to get a little nervous," he remarked. “I think the Wall Street's gotten a little too negative frankly, as we get oversold and we're getting there. But I've been warning about stocks going to excessive levels for two weeks now, so I can't be all that positive until we see a couple days where bond yields actually go lower with the stock market.” Cramer pointed out that retail sales figures will be released on Tuesday, and although they are coming out just before the Fed's meeting, they will likely stir significant debate. This is especially true given the unusual timing of Black Friday this year, with a compressed shopping period between Thanksgiving and Christmas. He speculated that the bond market had a rough week, and if retail sales come in cooler than expected, it could provide a much-needed counterbalance, perhaps offering a potential buying opportunity after the Fed meeting. READ ALSO Jim Cramer Talked About These 6 Airline Stocks and Jim Cramer Discussed 18 Companies That Hit $100 Billion in Market Cap in 2024 Looking ahead to Wednesday, Cramer noted that the Federal Open Market Committee is widely expected to cut interest rates by 25 basis points. While he cautioned that nothing is certain, he emphasized that numerous Fed officials have indicated that a rate reduction is likely. He added: “Every little signal from the Federal Reserve brings out predictions causing many people to sell good stocks when they are freaked out. You also have people who just can't let it go, dogs with bones. As soon as we get the Fed rate cut, well, guess what? They're immediately focused on the next cut. I think this is absurd.” Cramer clarified that while he does see the Fed as important, he believes investors should not get bogged down by every minor shift in central bank policy. He reminded viewers that the Fed operates based on data, not ideology. He acknowledged that there could be dissent within the Federal Open Market Committee, but he cautioned against making investment decisions solely based on what the Fed might do next. “Contrary to popular belief, there's more to investing than monetary policy and I wish everyone knew that. They don't.” Moving on to Friday, Cramer highlighted that the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation data would be released, offering the first look at the latest inflation numbers. “Finally, on Friday, we get our first look at the next set of inflation data, that's called the personal consumption expenditures number. Remember, my view is that we'll continue to get endless chatter about what the Fed might do or not. So if this number runs hot, you're gonna hear a lot of doomsaying, and why do I put it up there then? Well, because maybe it's a good opportunity to buy something on weakness because other people will be freaked out by what the doomsayers say.” In summary, Cramer believes we’re entering a seasonally strong period for stocks, though recent performance in some sectors has been underwhelming. He noted that while the Santa Claus rally typically provides a boost toward the end of the year, it’s important to wait for the Fed’s meeting to pass before making any significant moves. Our Methodology For this article, we compiled a list of 8 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the recent episode of Mad Money on December 13. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the third quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A team of trainers and athletes displaying a wide range of athletic and casual footwear. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 75 Cramer stated that NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) has to introduce more innovation to stay competitive with its rivals. “After the close, we believe we're gonna get a revelatory report from Nike. Now, the new CEO Elliott Hill, he's an old Nike hand by the way, will have to lay out a story about how to reignite this brand globally, which is undersold from Adidas, Hoka, Deckers, Hoka of Deckers, and then On Holdings, which we've had on a bunch of times. I think Nike has to do more than just say it'll work harder with its partners. That's a hackneyed statement, doesn't hold any water with me anymore. The company needs to show innovation, dazzling innovation, the kind that makes us feel like fools for even thinking of abandoning Nike. It's amazing how much damage the previous CEO did to this once unassailable brand. It won't be undone easily and we'll need both, a roadmap with a line of sight to the end of the number cuts and a sense of newness.” NIKE (NYSE:NKE) designs, develops, markets, and sells athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories, and services, including performance gear for various sports activities. It has been facing challenges in managing the right balance between direct-to-consumer sales and its broader sales strategy. Company executives admitted that they overemphasized direct and online sales, which left the brand unprepared for the return of in-store shopping as pandemic lockdowns eased. As the company reduced sales through large retail partners and redirected inventory to its own channels, it experienced a significant drop in revenue. In fiscal Q1 of 2025, revenue fell by 10% year-over-year, with sales coming in below expectations. In October, Matthew Friend, chief financial officer, acknowledged that the company had made mistakes by focusing too heavily on direct sales and said teams were engaging closely with partners to address these issues. Additionally, in October, NIKE (NYSE:NKE) replaced its CEO with Elliott Hill, a long-time company veteran. Hill previously ran Nike's product and marketplace division. The upcoming fiscal Q2 2025 earnings call ought to provide further insights into the new strategic direction under Hill’s leadership. Overall NKE ranks 2nd on our list of the stocks featured in Jim Cramer's game plan. While we acknowledge the potential of NKE as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NKE but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Wealth strategies that used to be reserved for billionaires are becoming more accessible
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/wealth-strategies-for-billionaires-are-becoming-more-accessible-2024-12
Time Published: 2024-12-17T19:17:32Z

Investing like a billionaire comes with a high price tag. But thanks to technology, the barriers to these elite opportunities are starting to crumble. Consider direct indexing, a strategy favored by the rich to lower taxes by selling underperforming stocks and using the losses to offset other gains. These personalized portfolios used to be out of reach of the merely affluent, requiring steep account minimums. Over the past five years, direct indexing has exploded as technological advancements have made it worthwhile for wealth managers to offer the services to Main Street customers. The account minimum for Fidelity's FidFolios, for example, is only $5,000. "Direct indexing has become accessible at a different level of wealth than it has been in the past," said Ranjit Kapila, the copresident and chief operating officer of Parametric. "That wouldn't have been available or possible without the technology trends we've had to be able to do this level of computation at scale in a cost-efficient manner." Parametric, the pioneer of direct indexing, is also moving downstream. By adopting fractional-share investing, Parametric lowered the minimum for its core product to $100,000 from $250,000. The firm plans to offer a direct-indexing product with fewer customization features for $25,000 in 2025. Private markets face steeper hurdles. This opaque field was traditionally reserved for deep-pocketed investors like pension funds and ultrarich individuals. But now investors have more access to financial results for funds and privately held companies as data providers race to meet their needs. Machine learning and AI have made it easier for these firms to extract and analyze data. BlackRock views this data as the great equalizer and has grand ambitions of indexing these opaque private markets. The asset-management giant agreed this summer to acquire the data powerhouse Preqin for $3.2 billion. "We anticipate indexes and data will be important to future drivers of the democratization of all alternatives," BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said on a conference call. "And this acquisition is the unlock." Leon Sinclair, Preqin's executive vice president, argued that with the number of public companies dwindling, it's imperative for mass-affluent investors to get better access to private markets. "Clearly there's more, deeper, better sources of funding for private companies that could stay private for longer," Sinclair said. "I think it's fair that the mass affluent can — in the right way — be brought along on that journey to get exposure to that part of the mosaic earlier." Kapila described these technological developments as part of a trend in wealth management to capture customers before they make it big. "There's a desire by financial advisors to try and engage investors earlier in their wealth-accumulation cycle," Kapila said. Parametric, acquired by Morgan Stanley in 2021, operates in a competitive arena. Thanks to a wave of similar acquisitions, Parametric faces well-capitalized rivals such as BlackRock's Aperio and Franklin Templeton's Canvas. Industry stalwarts like Fidelity and upstarts like Envestnet also want a piece of the action. Kapila said the need to compete on scale and fees required Parametric's technology to be as efficient as possible. "It'll be harder," he said. "We have to do many, many more accounts to really drive growth in assets, etc. But those challenges are exciting to me as a technologist." To meet that need, Kapila is pushing Parametric to develop more automated products, such as Radius, which launched this year. Radius constructs equity and fixed-income portfolios and runs simulations to identify the best selections for portfolio managers. He plans to launch more cloud-native tools, which are easier to scale and manage, for other asset classes in 2025 and 2026. Parametric is also piloting generative-AI tools to onboard accounts more efficiently. Clients' expectations are also rising. There's demand for Parametric's tax benefits but with actively managed strategies rather than indexes, he said, spurring partnerships with asset managers. Parametric recently launched an offering that allows customers to pick equities off strategies from the financial-advisory and asset-management firm Lazard. To stay ahead of the curve, Preqin is developing more sophisticated products. Last year, the UK firm launched an Actionability Signal that uses machine learning to identify private companies likely to be open for investment. "The sole focus on public information for certain tasks around valuation and risk management are not really going to be the way that people do this," Sinclair said. "We're moving much more to a world where real proprietary private information at the asset level, which is transactionally oriented, is available to people." In June, his division launched a data tool that analyzes $4.8 trillion worth of deals across 6,500 funds. This database can be used in a slew of ways, from backing up valuations in negotiations to identifying which financial factors, such as revenue growth or debt paydown, contributed the most value to a successful deal. With the rise of generative AI, Sinclair expects that users will be able to interpret data with more ease using natural language commands. "I think you'll see that be more prominent across the industry where people expect to interact with large data sets in really natural common ways," he said. "We think all that will probably start to be visible over the coming years." On average, retail investors allocate just 5% of their portfolios to alternative investments. If BlackRock successfully indexes private markets, it could go a long way toward boosting that percentage. However, Sinclair said more work is required to help mass affluent investors feel comfortable investing in private markets. As someone who grew up working class and was only introduced to finance in college, he knows there is an education gap to overcome. "To get Joe Bloggs very excited and comfortable with committing capital, they need to be able to understand what the different basis of those returns are," Sinclair said. He added: "I think it's in the industry's interest to enable those new sources of capital, to bridge the gap in understanding, to bridge the gap in analytics, to bridge the gap in frequency of reporting, to make that an easier journey for people to go on."

Title: Bitwise predicts Ethereum revival in 2025 driven by institutional interest, RWA growth

Bitwise investment strategist estimates that fees generated from RWA-linked activity on Ethereum could ultimately surpass $100 billion annually. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Ethereum (ETH) is poised for a resurgence in 2025 as it rides a wave of emerging trends to capitalize on a $100 trillion opportunity in tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs), according to a letter shared with investors by Bitwise’s senior investment strategist, Juan Leon. The document highlighted that the crypto market was marked by two narratives this year: Bitcoin’s (BTC) new all-time high, driven by spot exchange-traded funds (ETF) approval in the US, and Solana’s (SOL) meteoric popularity as retail investors piled into memecoin speculation. As a result, Ethereum’s 66% year-to-date return paled when compared to BTC’s 130% gain and SOL’s 106% rally. However, recent signs suggest a reversal of sentiment. Over the past 10 days, Ethereum ETFs have attracted a staggering $2 billion in net inflows, eight times the $250 million net inflows recorded in the preceding four months. On Dec. 5, data from Farside Investors pointed out that the spot Ethereum ETFs traded in the US registered $428.5 million in inflows, a new daily record propelled by $292.7 million directed at BlackRock’s ETHA. Moreover, Ethereum ETFs saw less than three-digit daily inflows in only 3 out of the 10 past trading days saw inflows. This surge indicates that institutional and retail investors are warming up to Ethereum again. The tokenization of real-world assets might be the fuel for Ethereum’s resurgence. This process involves digitizing traditional assets — such as Treasury bills, real estate, and commodities — into blockchain-based tokens, offering faster, cheaper, and more efficient trading and settlement. Tokenization is no longer a far-off dream. Major players like BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, and UBS have adopted blockchain technology to tokenize RWAs. BlackRock’s tokenized treasury fund, BUIDL, currently has a market cap of $544 million. According to the letter, real-world assets are valued at roughly $100 trillion globally, creating a staggering opportunity. While it could take decades for significant portions of this market to shift to blockchain rails, Leon sees immense potential upside. Considering that Ethereum holds 81% of the RWA market, Leon estimates that fees generated from RWA-linked activity on Ethereum could ultimately surpass $100 billion annually, more than 40 times the network’s $2.4 billion in fees year-to-date. The letter attributes Ethereum’s dominance to its status as the most reliable and decentralized smart contract platform, secured by its long history of supporting decentralized applications and its vast distributed validator network. As the world’s largest asset managers explore tokenized assets, Ethereum remains the “battle-tested” standard. Furthermore, regulatory tailwinds could accelerate this transformation, setting Ethereum for potentially explosive growth. The letter noted that an increasingly pro-crypto U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) may provide much-needed clarity, removing barriers to adoption and institutional participation.

Title: Agreement reached on redundancy terms for staff at BD Drogheda plant

Time Published: 2024-12-17T18:11:33Z
Full Content:
Management and staff representatives at the Becton Dickenson (BD) plant in Drogheda have reached agreement on redundancy terms more than five months after it was announced the facility is to close. The final deal is understood to provide for staff to receive six weeks of pay per year of service capped at two years’ pay in addition to their statutory entitlements. There are also to be service recognition payments of €3,000 per year for those working for the company for more than 17⅓ years as well as payments to cover the loss of benefits like health insurance and orderly wind down payments linked to productivity. Almost 200 people currently work at the plant which opened in 1964. The decision to close it was taken by the company after an international supply chain review. About 110 people will leave in March of next year with the rest staying on until the scheduled closure in September 2026. Plant manager Catherina McGuirk said the decision to close had been “extremely difficult” but that “the agreement recognises the commitment and hard work that every employee has given to BD over the years and gives our employees the clarity they need to plan for the future as we all move forward.” She said that with agreement now in place, the company would seek to take steps to ensure it leaves a last positive legacy in Drogheda. Mike Fairbourn, BD’s general manager across the UK and Ireland said the company would work with government agencies and others to seek a new owner for the plant. “I am very aware of the impact this has had on our employees and the local community,” he said. “This is why BD has committed to work collaboratively with the IDA and local officials to secure a new owner for the facility. This would mean that the site can remain as a contributor to Drogheda’s economic growth, as well as a potential source of employment. Siptu sector organiser, Andrea Cleere, welcomed the agreement with the company which was reached after talks between management, unions and other staff representatives at the Workplace Relations Commission. “The acceptance by our members of these redundancy terms has brought clarity concerning the conclusion of their employment with Becton Dickinson and will now allow them to plan for their future,” she said. She said some of those scheduled to leave in March had already secured new employment to commence in the period afterwards. The medical devices multinational continues to operate other facilities at Enniscorthy, Limerick and Blackrock in Dublin.

Title: Is Salesforce (CRM) Betting on Agentforce to Drive Growth?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Top 10 AI Stocks to Watch: Latest News and Ratings. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM) stands against the other top AI stocks to watch. Former OpenAI chief scientist Ilya Sutskever recently claimed that a major change is on the horizon of artificial intelligence. Accepting a "Test Of Time" award for his 2014 paper with Oriol Vinyals and Quoc Le on Friday, December 13, he claimed that reasoning capabilities will make the technology far less predictable. He discussed how an idea his team had explored a decade ago regarding scaling data to new heights for pre-training AI systems, has begun to reach its limits. As such, more data and computing power had resulted in ChatGPT which OpenAI launched in 2022. "But pre-training as we know it will unquestionably end. While compute is growing, the data is not growing, because we have but one internet”. READ ALSO: 10 AI News Investors Shouldn’t Miss and 10 AI Stocks Taking Wall Street by Storm Speaking of its limits, Sutskever also proposed some ways of breaking new ground, such as technology itself generating new data, or AI models evaluating multiple answers before choosing the best response for a user, to improve accuracy. He further went on to predict a future of super-intelligent, self-aware AI capable of reasoning like humans, forecasting that the long-awaited AI agents will eventually become a reality in this advanced era. As such, AI leaders are now hinting that the generative AI revolution is entering a new phase, with advanced foundation models poised to bring reasoning and long-term thinking to AI capabilities. “We’re in the beginnings of this generative AI revolution as we all know. And we’re at the beginning of a new generation of foundation models that are able to do reasoning and able to do long thinking.” Long thinking enables AI models to take more time to “think over” the results they generate for us, and are an effort to bring AI into System 2. System 2, a term popularized by Daniel Kahneman in his book “Thinking, Fast and Slow”, represents a mode of thinking that is slow, deliberate, analytical, and demanding conscious effort. As these capabilities develop further, AI is expected to move beyond its current applications in different sectors to intensely impact fields like medicine, research, and education, as evidenced by OpenAI’s recent advancements and their practical benefits in accelerating scientific discovery. “We’re going to have AI systems that can talk more fluently with us, that can also visualize the real world. And this combination of reasoning and multimodal capabilities, I think, is going to enable us to build more powerful agentic applications next year.” For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A customer service team in an office setting using the company's Customer 360 platform to communicate with customers. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 116 Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM) is a cloud-based CRM company that has gained significant traction after the launch of its AI-powered platform called Agentforce. On December 12, Macquarie analyst Steve Koenig initiated coverage of Salesforce with a “Neutral” rating and a $370 price target. The analyst told investors in a research note that Salesforce CEO and founder Marc Benioff is aiming to position the company as a “digital labor” pioneer with the new Agentforce product. The move strives to target growth as share gains stall and the company faces slowing momentum. Even though there is excitement and interest around Agentforce, there may be some challenges, the analyst noted. In particular, the consumption-based pricing model of Gen AI functionality could disrupt Salesforce's current seat-based revenue model. In addition, Salesforce’s sequential revenue additions have been declining for three years, a key concern for the firm. As such, meeting market expectations requires a turnaround. Overall, CRM ranks 3rd on our list of top 10 AI Stocks to watch. While we acknowledge the potential of CRM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CRM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: NYPD ‘Finds’ Large Drone Abandoned In Navy Yard, People Question Suspicious Explanation
URL: https://brobible.com/culture/article/nypd-drone-abandoned-navy-yard-question-suspicious-explanation/
Time Published: 2024-12-17T17:51:28Z

iStockphoto The recent series of UFO and drone sightings across the United States, especially in the Northeast, has law enforcement and American citizens on high alert. That includes the New York Police Department (NYPD), which recently experienced their own strange story involving a large, mysterious drone. According to a New York Post report and a video shared on social media, the New York Police Department came into possession of this large, mysterious drone after an email tip. The drone, which appears to measure approximately six-feet in diameter, was reportedly discovered by the NYPD on the sidewalk at Fifth Street between Market Street and Morris Avenue in the Brooklyn Navy Yard. As officers were investigating, a passer-by said he worked in the building that houses the headquarters of the drone’s manufacturer — which he identified as Amogy Inc., a sustainable energy startup working to use ammonia as a renewable fuel source, including for aerial vehicles. Amogy CEO Seonghoon Woo would later tell police, according to New York Post sources, that the drone was owned by his company. He also reportedly claimed that the drone was inoperable and had been placed on the sidewalk after a company party about a month ago. An Amogy spokesperson told the New York Post that the drone was used in a demonstration of its clean energy technology three years ago. The spokesperson also added, “NYPD took possession of it for a brief period.

Title: Indiana Fund Narrows Finalists to Replace BlackRock

The Indiana Public Retirement System has identified State Street, Northern Trust and UBS Asset Management as potential replacements for BlackRock as manager of a $969 million global fixed-income portfolio, INPRS staff said during a December 13 board meeting. Indiana law, passed in May, requires state pension funds to replace a manager or service provider if the firm is determined to have made “ESG commitments,” defined as actions taken or factors considered “with the nonfinancial purpose” related to environmental, social or governance issues. If a manager or service provider is determined to have made an ESG commitment, then the board of INPRS must replace them with a comparable firm if one is available. If there is at least one service provider expected to be materially equivalent or materially better financially for the system, then the comparable firm must be chosen. On June 21, Indiana State Treasurer Dan Elliott determined that BlackRock Inc. was engaged in an ESG commitment, citing BlackRock’s Form 10-K filing that referenced ESG risks and the firm’s status as a signatory to the Net Zero Asset Management Initiative, a group of 325 managers representing $57.5 trillion in assets that support investing aligned to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Never miss a story — sign up for CIO newsletters to stay up-to-date on the latest institutional investment industry news.  Following the treasurer’s finding, INPRS issued on June 28 a request for proposals for potential replacements. The BlackRock portfolio eligible for replacement is a passive global inflation-linked bond portfolio. “It’s a portfolio that, frankly, in my opinion, is not even ESG-related, because it’s a global fixed-income portfolio,” said one INPRS staff member in the December 13 meeting. INPRS staff and the fund’s investment consultant, Verus, determined State Street, UBS and Northern Trust to be comparable to BlackRock, following the RFP process. “They all have over $1 trillion in assets, [and] they all have passive fixed-income assets greater than $90 billion,” an INPRS staff member said in the meeting. Like BlackRock, State Street, Northern Trust and UBS are all members of the Net Zero Asset Owner Initiative. Firms like State Street have also been placed on watchlists and have been scrutinized for ESG commitments. The board of INPRS made a unanimous decision to confirm those three firms as comparable vendors. A provider selection is due within 180 days of the RFP, which puts the deadline as December 25. INPRS staff at the board meeting noted that there were no concerns with BlackRock’s investment performance, but BlackRock’s status as engaged in an ESG commitment dictated the change. “We’re proud of having helped hundreds of thousands of Indianans invest and retire with dignity. Despite this decision, we remain committed to Indiana and the $102 billion we have invested in the state on behalf of our clients,” a spokesperson for BlackRock said in a statement. INPRS manages $46 billion in assets for more than 529,000 beneficiaries.

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us With cloud spend continuing to surge, tech companies are scrambling to meet demand for the necessary infrastructure, with the growing need for AI compute only adding fuel to the fire. By way of example, Microsoft and BlackRock have created a $30 billion fund to support new data centers and energy infrastructure for the burgeoning AI boom, and Meta is planning a new $10 billion subsea cable that will span the entire globe. Google, for its part, recently announced Umoja, the first subsea fiber-optic cable to connect Africa and Australia — and it’s joining a $90 million funding round into Cassava Technologies, one of the partner companies involved in the Umoja project. With its first African data center operational for a year, among other infrastructure projects such as the Equiano subsea cable, Google confirmed to TechCrunch that it’s now taking a direct equity stake in Cassava, though it didn’t provide comment on the rationale behind the investment. However, it’s clear that it’s looking to improve infrastructure across the continent. Indeed, Africa has been hit by widespread outages throughout 2024, which have been attributed to faulty undersea cables, so it makes sense that Google would want to fund efforts to bolster connectivity for consumers and businesses that might want to use its services. Cassava announced $310 million in funding overall, though $220 million of that is in the form of a credit facility for one of its subsidiaries. The $90 million equity tranche included investments from the U.S. federal government’s International Development Finance Corporation (DFC); Finnish development finance company Finnfund; and Google itself. The funding will help Cassava: “… strengthen its balance sheet, drive sustainable profitable growth, and cement its position as a global technology company of African heritage,” according to a press release that also detailed a broader reorganization of the company. “It’s a pivotal milestone that we expect to unlock immense value and catalyze the further expansion of our digital infrastructure and services to bridge the digital divide on the continent,” Cassava CEO and President Hardy Pemhiwa (pictured above) said. African telecommunication company Econet spun out Cassava in 2021, serving as a standalone business for Econet’s various digital services and infrastructure initiatives spanning data centers, fiber broadband networks, renewable energy, cloud, cybersecurity, and more. Although Africa is a major focal point for Cassava, it also operates across other “key growth markets” including the Middle East, India, and Latin America. Among its business units is Liquid Intelligent Technologies, which worked with Google to build the terrestrial segment of Umoja; the cable starts in Kenya, and snakes through the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe, before concluding its land journey in South Africa. Separately, another of Cassava’s business units, Liquid C2, this year announced a partnership with Google and Anthropic to bring “advanced cloud, cybersecurity solutions, and generative AI” services to companies across Africa. This constituted part of Google’s previous commitment to invest $1 billion in Africa’s digital economy. “Businesses are increasingly turning to generative AI to drive operational efficiencies, improve the customer experience, and empower their employees like never before,” Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian said of its partnership with Liquid C2 at the time. “This partnership has the opportunity to transform how African businesses serve and engage their customers as we provide them a foundation for innovation.” Topics Senior Reporter Microsoft bought nearly 500K Nvidia Hopper chips this year OpenAI brings ChatGPT to your landline GitHub launches a free version of its Copilot ‘It’s dumb to IPO this year’: Databricks CEO explains why he’s waiting to go public Insight VC describes Databricks’ wild $10B deal and the bad advice the CEO ignored A comprehensive list of 2024 tech layoffs This fintech processed $1B in payments through word-of-mouth Subscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news Every weekday and Sunday, you can get the best of TechCrunch’s coverage.

Zoth and Singularity Finance announced their collaboration on December 17, 2024, launching ZTLN Prime (ZTLN-P), a tokenized investment product that bridges traditional finance with blockchain technology. The product aims to provide institutional investors with access to U.S. Treasury ETFs and money market funds through blockchain infrastructure. ZTLN-P represents a shift in how institutions can manage treasury assets, combining traditional financial instruments with digital asset technology. The product is backed by Blackrock-managed iShares ETFs and money market funds, focusing on U.S. Treasury bills, which provides a foundation for stable returns in the digital asset space. The partnership leverages Singularity Finance's tokenization framework and Zoth's experience in bringing traditional financial instruments to blockchain networks. This combination addresses several key challenges in the digital asset space, particularly around regulatory compliance and liquidity management. The regulatory framework supporting ZTLN-P includes oversight from the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority (CIMA) and adherence to the Mutual Funds Act (2021 Revision). This regulatory structure provides institutional investors with familiar compliance frameworks while operating in the digital asset space. Doo Group serves as the custodian for the underlying assets, adding another layer of institutional infrastructure to the product. This custody arrangement demonstrates the project's focus on establishing traditional financial safeguards within the digital asset ecosystem. The significance of this launch extends beyond the immediate product offering. It represents a growing trend of bringing traditional financial instruments into the blockchain space, potentially opening new paths for institutional adoption of digital asset technology. Pritam Dutta, CEO of Zoth, emphasized the product's focus on institutional-grade investments, noting how it combines traditional treasury instruments with blockchain efficiency. Mario Casiraghi, Co-founder of SingularityDAO and Singularity Finance, highlighted the product's role in bridging traditional and decentralized finance. The launch also showcases Singularity Finance's broader strategy in the real-world asset (RWA) space. Cloris Chen, CEO at Singularity Finance, explained how ZTLN Prime fits into their ecosystem development plans, particularly in creating infrastructure for RWA projects. This development comes at a time when institutional interest in digital assets continues to evolve, with a growing focus on products that combine traditional financial stability with blockchain technology's efficiency. The partnership between Zoth and Singularity Finance demonstrates how companies are working to meet this institutional demand. Looking ahead, this collaboration could influence how other companies approach the integration of traditional financial products with blockchain technology. The focus on regulatory compliance, institutional-grade custody solutions, and traditional asset backing might set precedents for future developments in the space. The launch of ZTLN Prime also reflects the broader evolution of the digital asset industry, as it moves toward products that cater to institutional requirements while maintaining the benefits of blockchain technology. This balance between innovation and institutional standards could prove crucial for the industry's continued development. For institutional investors, ZTLN Prime offers a new option for treasury management that combines familiar assets with new technology. The product's structure suggests a potential template for future institutional-focused digital asset products, particularly in how they approach asset backing, regulatory compliance, and risk management. This development indicates a maturing digital asset ecosystem, where traditional financial products and blockchain technology can coexist within regulatory frameworks, potentially opening new opportunities for institutional participation in the digital asset space.

Title: Buy, Sell, Or Hold Bitcoin?

Bitcoin logo is seen in this illustration photo taken in Warsaw, Poland on 05 December, 2024. ... [+] (Photo by Jaap Arriens/NurPhoto via Getty Images) The price of Bitcoin cryptocurrency (BTC) is likely headed to new highs in 2025 after surging nearly 150% in 2024. Currently trading at nearly $104,000, Bitcoin has eclipsed AI superstar Nvidia in the last 6 months with >55% returns while Nvidia stock barely moved (Sell Nvidia, Buy Intel Stock?). There are reasons to be excited about Bitcoin going into next year considering the political, administrative and market developments. Cryptocurrency has traditionally been regarded as a “speculative” asset with no real contribution to the economy. However, it’s hard to ignore its growing legitimacy, increased adoption, and demand. But, other opportunities exist, too. Up 40% in a week? See What’s Happening With Broadcom Stock? The OG cryptocurrency crossed $100,000 mark for the first time riding on support from the Donald Trump-led administration. In addition to a shift in regulatory view, notable institution adoption, broader ecosystem developments, limited availability, and global macroeconomic uncertainty could put Bitcoin above $150,000 by the end of 2025. But Bitcoin’s rise hasn’t been without its risks and accompanying volatility. If you want upside with a smoother ride than crypto, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception. Donald Trump’s evolving stance on Cryptocurrency bodes well for Bitcoin’s future. His view toward creating a strategic Bitcoin reserve, and a need for favorable cryptocurrency regulations, is re-vitalizing confidence in the Cryptocurrency. One item on Trump’s presidential campaign agenda was to create a strategic reserve for Bitcoin. While it’s still far from materializing, a concrete bill has already been proposed in the Senate. If passed, it would entitle the Treasury and the Fed to build a reserve of about 5% of the global Bitcoin supply within five years with the purpose of hedging against currency risk, lowering national debt, and supporting the country’s balance sheet. Historically skeptic SEC chair, Gary Gensler, has already decided to step down, which will likely pave the way for crypto-friendly regulations going forward. Moreover, Donald Trump’s team is contemplating creating a dedicated position in the White House to oversee and drive the blockchain ecosystem. These developments will likely work to mitigate risks of investing in a speculative asset, inviting more players into the market - and this is already happening. See What’s Behind The 500% Rise In RGTI Stock? Growing Institutional investor interest toward Bitcoin is very clear. Bitcoin ETFs have been the most popular in 2024 – a year that saw record new ETF launches. Blackrock iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF has already amassed AUM of $45bn + since its launch in January 2024. As of August 2024, Private Companies and ETFs controlled over 1.2 million units of Bitcoins representing 6.29% of the total supply of Bitcoins. In addition, the cryptocurrency’s holdings of publicly traded companies rose almost 200% year-on-year to ~$20 billion, as of mid-2024. Amid the prevailing geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainty, Bitcoin is emerging as a lucrative investment option and a hedge against crashing fiat currencies especially in hyperinflationary environments such as in Venezuela, Zimbabwe, and Lebanon. In 2023, Bitcoins made up 9% of Venezuela’s remittances, with crypto adoption further picking up amid oil sanctions. Bitcoin can emerge as a viable hedging instrument for governments as well, with a possibility of central banks diversifying their asset pool with Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies. The U.S. and China are already headed that way with other countries likely to follow suit. The price surge is likely to get a boost from fixed supply and growing demand. This “scarcity” sets Bitcoins apart from conventional fiat currencies. There are only about 21 million coins in existence today, which is essentially all the bitcoins that have been mined. The rate at which new coins are mined drops around the halving events that happen every four years, with the most recent one in April 2024. When the reward to mine new Bitcoin is halved, fewer new coins are mined and added to the pool, thus limiting the supply and driving up prices. In fact, historical trends around halving events have shown a subsequent rise in Bitcoin prices. This year, the price has gone up over 50% since April. Back in April 2020, the price jumped 10x in the one year that followed. Though all the increase cannot be attributed to halving alone, its role is consequential. Since Bitcoin arguably still lacks any intrinsic value, it is susceptible to market sentiment which makes its price volatile. Three years ago, Bitcoin dropped almost 50% twice. First from March 2021 to June 21, and again from Nov 2021 to Jan 2022. Besides, with limited supply of units, the price is potentially open to manipulation by large institutional investors. Cybersecurity threats to stored bitcoins, and potential environmental impact related restrictions also add to the risks involved in this asset class. There have been numerous periods - such as 2018 and 2022 when bitcoin could not beat the S&P 500. In fact, consistently beating the broader markets — in good times and bad — has been difficult over recent years for individual stocks and even cryptocurrencies. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: 'Most clients are probably out of balance': BlackRock's stock chief says investors should consider this portfolio change in 2025

Buying an S&P 500 index fund has long been considered an easy way to gain broad market exposure and diversification. But these days, this is increasingly not the case, warns Tony DeSpirito, BlackRock's chief investment officer for US fundamental active equity and the lead portfolio manager of the BlackRock Equity Dividend portfolios. In the past, the largest sector in the S&P 500 has typically made up less than 20% of the index. Post-pandemic, that's changed as Big Tech companies' share prices have taken off. As the largest names in the index continue to grow in market capitalization, they've brought the index along with them and driven much of the overall market returns. These high concentration levels leave investors vulnerable to market fluctuations and risks such as a potential resurgence in inflation, which has historically hurt growth names, according to DeSpirito. "Most clients are probably out of balance. They've gotten growth tilted," DeSpirito told BI. "There's an opportunity to supplement it with value," he added. DeSpirito believes it would serve investors well to take a step back from growth and increase their allocation to value stocks in 2025. With flashy, fast-growing companies like the Magnificent Seven taking the spotlight in recent years, it's not hard to see why value has been pushed aside. Today's investors are hungry for growth stocks, which typically increase their profits at a quicker clip than value stocks, or those that trade at a lower price than intrinsic value and are priced below their peers. But investors who aren't actively seeking growth are still overexposed to it. Even before the Magnificent Seven's run-up, the stock market had been tilting towards growth for the last decade, as low interest rates made it more attractive for investors to bet on less-established stocks, according to Björn Jesch, chief investment officer of the asset manager DWS. These factors have created a highly concentrated market dominated by the technology sector, DeSpirito said. As a result, when investors buy the S&P 500 index, they become overexposed to growth by default. DeSpirito sees two main reasons why investors should start shifting away from growth. Concentration risk and persistent inflation significantly shaped markets in 2024, and DeSpirito believes they'll continue to do so in 2025. That's where value investing comes in, he said, as value stocks provide diversification on both fronts. Market concentration is at an all-time high, surpassing dot-com bubble levels by many measures. Today, the movements of just a few stocks — for example, Nvidia — can disproportionately impact the rest of the market. Exposure to value stocks can reduce that volatility and ensure that your portfolio performance isn't at the mercy of a single stock or sector: "Value stocks look a lot different from the Magnificent Seven," DeSpirito said. Historically, it's not been sustainable for market concentration to remain elevated for extended periods of time. Expect more stocks to contribute to the overall gains of the S&P 500 in 2025, DeSpirito predicted. Investors who diversify and add value stocks to their portfolio will benefit from the market broadening out beyond the Big Tech names. DeSpirito added that value stocks also have an impressive track record during inflationary periods. On the other hand, high valuation multiples tend to decline in response to elevated inflation, meaning that expensively priced growth stocks are more sensitive to inflation. Just look at 2022, when inflation surged to over 9% and central banks began to raise interest rates. The MSCI World Growth Index, which tracks large and mid-cap growth stocks, dropped almost 30% over the course of 2022, while the MSCI World Value Index only declined around 6% in the same time period. Investors looking to get exposure to value might decide to buy a broad value index, but DeSpirito cautions against that. The S&P 500 isn't the only index that's gotten growth-heavy: "Even when I look at value indices, they too have shifted more towards growth," DeSpirito said. "You really need to find an active manager who stuck to their value discipline," DeSpirito added. Investors can also take a sector approach to diversifying with value. "Value stocks are mainly found in the financial, healthcare, industrial, and energy sectors. Growth stocks are mainly found in the technology, consumer discretionary, and communication services sectors," Jesch wrote in a recent note. Examples of actively managed value funds include the iShares Large Cap Value Active ETF (BLCV), which DeSpirito manages, the T. Rowe Price Value ETF (TVAL), and the Avantis US Large Cap Value ETF (AVLV). Jump to

Title: 6 unique ways we advanced energy solutions in 2024

Time Published: 2024-12-17T14:00:00Z

[[read-time]] min read Highlighting some of the steps we took to build a smarter energy future this year. Demand for electricity is rising across the world, driven by the rapid growth of manufacturing and AI, electrification of buildings and transportation, and the ongoing digitalization of our economy and society. Meeting this growing demand is one of the key challenges of our time and an enormous opportunity to build a smarter energy system that benefits people everywhere. This year, we pursued a range of actions to procure more energy and drive new technological and market innovations — all with the aim of driving the systems change needed to meet growing electricity demand affordably, sustainably and reliably. Here are six unique ways ways we made progress in 2024: Operating on carbon-free energy every hour of the day requires technologies like geothermal and nuclear power that can fill gaps in wind and solar generation. But these technologies are often costly and existing markets do not incentivize their development. That’s why we partnered with NV Energy to propose a new clean transition rate that brings corporate buyers and utilities together to unlock new investments. This will make it easier to develop projects that deliver “clean, firm” capacity to the grid while ensuring their costs aren’t passed along to other electricity consumers. This model can be replicated in additional markets, starting with Duke Energy, where we signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to explore the development of a similar rate structure in their service territory. Bringing new clean energy online is particularly challenging in the Asia Pacific region, where wind and solar resources are not readily available in many markets. In addition to announcing long-term agreements for new clean energy capacity in the region, we partnered with BlackRock to develop a 1 GW pipeline of new solar capacity in Taiwan. Our investment in solar developer New Green Power will help meet Google’s electricity demand in Taiwan and allow us to offer some of this new capacity to our semiconductor suppliers and equipment manufacturers in the region. Through these nine projects in five countries across the region, this year we're proving it’s possible to turn challenges into opportunities in Asia Pacific. In addition to creating new mechanisms to accelerate advanced clean energy technologies, we are also supporting the companies developing these technologies and bringing them to market. Our new, first-of-its-kind partnership with Kairos Power will unlock up to 500 MW of new, clean power from a series of small modular nuclear reactors. Kairos Power’s passively safe system and iterative development approach will help bring down costs and ensure more communities can benefit from clean, reliable nuclear power. No company alone can advance new clean energy technologies at the speed and scale required to decarbonize global electricity systems. That’s why we launched a new initiative with Microsoft and Nucor to aggregate our demand for advanced, clean technologies like enhanced geothermal, long-duration energy storage, clean hydrogen, and advanced nuclear. These technologies are critical to achieving fully decarbonized, reliable electricity grids, but their early stage development requires significant upfront investment. By working together, large clean energy buyers can accelerate the investments and market innovations needed to scale these essential technologies. This year, we upscaled our first-of-its-kind process that dramatically accelerates the execution of power purchase agreements (PPAs) with clean energy developers. The results since we started using this process have been meaningful: we’ve signed contracts to purchase over 3.3 GW of new clean energy generation capacity across North America and Europe and we’ve cut the time required to negotiate and execute these PPAs by roughly 80%. We recently unveiled a novel strategic partnership with Intersect Power and TPG Rise Climate to co-locate data centers with new clean energy in the U.S. By thoughtfully building data center load next to new additional power generation where possible, we’ll reduce both the timeline to operation and the amount of new transmission required. This model is an important complement to efforts to unlock development of new transmission infrastructure and optimize utilization of the existing grid. While the diverse range of actions we’ve taken this year have helped advance the next generation of energy solutions, there’s much more to be done. As we build on this year’s momentum in the years to come, we will continue to refine our approach and push for the innovations needed to create more reliable, affordable, and sustainable energy systems.

Title: America Vs. The World? Both Can Win With These 8%+ Dividends

A detailed view of the earth from space with night lights It looks like 2024 will end with a big gain for investors in US stocks, with the S&P 500 up 28% year-to-date, even better than my (admittedly optimistic) expectations: I saw a roughly 15% gain for the S&P 500 going into the year. If this gain holds, 2024 will go down as one of the best years in the last 20, with only 2013 and 2019 doing (just slightly) better. However, unlike those years, the momentum isn’t coming mainly from tech, with the benchmark Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLK) actually trailing the market, with a 24.5% return year-to-date, as of this writing. That’s a good sign because it suggests that AI darlings like NVIDIA (NVDA) aren’t driving the market to irrational heights. Instead, this looks like a strong fundamental recovery after 2022’s selloff. Since that selloff was mainly driven by speculation about a recession that never happened, the 2024 bounce makes sense. Still, if you’re mainly holding US stocks, you might be wondering if, after all these gains, now is a good time to focus more on foreign shares. We actually discussed one strategy for doing so through our favorite closed-end funds (CEFs) in last Thursday’s article. The chart below lends weight to this idea. Look at how the benchmark S&P 500 index fund (in purple) has done compared to the iShares Core MSCI Total International Stock ETF (IXUS), in orange. IXUS tracks global stocks, excluding the US: IXUS Total Returns Global stocks’ lag suggests it’s a good time to go into them. Problem is, this could be said for just about any given time since IXUS’s IPO over a decade ago. The fund (in orange below) has badly trailed the S&P 500 ever since. SPY Outperforms The reason behind this gap makes sense if you think about it: US companies are generally more profitable than their overseas cousins and, as a result, have attracted higher prices. This isn’t a 2024 story—it goes back nearly half a century, as this chart from Goldman Sachs shows. US Stocks Soar The takeaway here is that foreign stocks—at least if they’re bought individually or through an ETF—are at best a short-term investment. But the calculus changes somewhat when you buy them through a CEF, due to two things: When an international CEF trades at a deep enough discount, we can ride that discount as it closes, propelling the fund’s price along with it. And we’ll collect those high dividends as that happens. We can see that in the BlackRock Enhanced International Dividend Trust (BGY), a holding in our CEF Insider service that we also discussed in last Thursday’s article. Since the start of 2024, BGY’s discount has shrunk from around 15% to 9% as I write this, helping drive a 13.5% total return. And with BGY yielding 9.1% now, thanks in part to a recently announced dividend hike, most of this return has come as dividend cash. So with discounted CEFs like BGY, then, buying international can make some sense, since you can get these funds’ assets at a discount and collect their outsized income streams while you wait for that discount to disappear. (Though we still have to be careful given global stocks’ long-term underperformance—with BGY’s discount narrowing, we are moving closer to shifting it to a “hold” form a “buy” in our portfolio. Then perhaps we’ll sell and take profits). That closing discount gives a fund like BGY a big advantage over an international ETF like the iShares MSCI EAFE ETF (EFA), which doesn’t get the “discount booster” a marked-down CEF does—and saddles us with a mere 2.9% dividend. We can see the difference these things make when we stack up the year-to-date total return of our CEF, BGY (in orange), with EFA (in purple). BGY Outperforms But our international-CEF exception aside, we continue to focus mainly on US-based stocks (and US-based CEFs) in CEF Insider. We can see why in the performance of the Adams Diversified Equity Fund (ADX), a holding in our portfolio that’s topped the S&P 500 with a 30.6% year-to-date return. The fund holds many US blue chips we all know well: Microsoft (MSFT), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) and Visa (V) among them. It trades at an 11.4% discount. The best part? Nearly half of the fund’s return came as dividends, thanks to ADX’s high yield: 8.1% as I write this. This is not easy for ADX’s management, investing as they are in a relatively volatile asset class, because they need to maintain a high cash outflow while still staying in the market. But ADX has a long history of sending high payouts to investors—and a long history in general: the fund was founded back in 1929. The bottom line? For income and for long-term performance, ADX is a clear winner. And second, any long-term investment outside the US should be handled with care and generally shorter term, with deep-discounted, and high-yielding, CEFs playing a role.

Investing.com -- Billionaire dealmaker Michael Rees is exploring the possibility of merging three to five firms from Blue Owl's portfolio to create a major player in the industry, according to the Financial Times, citing four sources privy to the matter. The proposed combination would encompass a range of sectors, including private equity buyouts, credit-based investments, infrastructure deals, and real estate. Blue Owl was established in 2021 through the merger of Dyal Capital, a firm founded by Rees, with credit investor Owl Rock Capital (NYSE:OBDC) and a public Spac during the boom. It owns stakes in private infrastructure groups such as Stonepeak and I Squared Capital, as well as firms with large infrastructure-like portfolios like Bridgepoint. Blue Owl also holds minority stakes in Vista Equity Partners, Silver Lake, HIG Capital, Platinum Equity, Cerberus, and Clearlake Capital among others. The firm would not be involved in any potential merger. While Rees's proposal is still in its nascent stages, it highlights the ongoing consolidation in the alternative investment market. Top dealmakers in the industry are being compelled to decide whether to remain private and focus on a few core strengths or join larger publicly listed financial groups. Last week's $12 billion acquisition of credit manager HPS by BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), a company in Blue Owl's portfolio, has prompted many firms to reconsider their strategies. There's a growing concern among executives that the industry's influence will increasingly be controlled by a few diversified entities capable of attracting new capital from sources ranging from large sovereign wealth funds to individual investors and potentially even retirement savers. In October, Goldman Sachs executive Michael Brandmeyer cautioned that many independent private equity groups were underestimating the influx of cash to larger players and the challenges arising from succession processes. He referred to these groups as "zombie firms," stating that they were unaware they were investing their last funds. Despite the ongoing disruption in the private equity industry, advisors have noted that deal discussions rarely result in transactions due to concerns about conflicting strategies and personalities. As one private capital executive close to Blue Owl puts it, the merger proposed by Rees would be a "merger of equals," with different valuations in different sectors and some overlap, making it a complex yet potentially beneficial move.

Title: Why Is Amkor Technology (AMKR) Among the Best Semiconductor Equipment Stocks to Buy Now?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Best Semiconductor Equipment Stocks to Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amkor Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMKR) stands against other best semiconductor equipment stocks to buy now. Semiconductors are the modern-day equivalent of oil when it comes to the general well-being of the global economy. Tens of thousands of gadgets, computers, cars, and other items and products rely on a steady stream of chips to power up today’s world. As a result, chip manufacturers often have a steady flow of orders that they have to consistently churn out to ensure that a multitude of industries are not disrupted. However, while chip manufacturers often see most media coverage, the complex nature of transforming sand into a chip capable of 20 petaflops of output requires thousands of steps. To execute these steps, manufacturers rely on a diverse set of suppliers for a myriad of products such as chip manufacturing machines, specialty chemicals, masks, design technologies, and other items. Firms that provide these products and technologies are called semiconductor equipment providers and their role in the industry is just as important as the chip manufacturers’ is. To understand why semiconductor equipment stocks are important, consider the Biden Administration’s $280 billion CHIPS and Science Act. Signed by the President in 2022, it aims to ensure that the American semiconductor industry catches up to its peers in Taiwan and South Korea and is not dependent on any disruptions in the South China Sea. The biggest beneficiary of the CHIPS Act is the Taiwanese contract chip manufacturer that leads the world in manufacturing technologies. It ranked 4th on our recent list of trending AI stocks, and the firm has received $6.6 billion in direct funding and it is eligible for $5 billion in additional loans to set up advanced manufacturing facilities in Arizona. Yet, even though the first of these facilities is set to start production in the first half of 2025, the fact that the firm’s operations are based in Taiwan is already creating problems. For starters, a report from Reuters suggests that the world’s leading AI GPU manufacturer (which ranked 3rd on our list above) might have to ship its GPUs to Taiwan for packaging after they’ve been manufactured in the US. This is because after the chips are manufactured, they have to be packaged to ensure power supply and communications with the rest of the computer system. The packaging technologies for these advanced chips are called Chip-on-Wafer-on-Substrate (CoWoS), and for the Taiwanese firm, all of its packaging facilities are located in its home region. The need to ship the chips to Taiwan for packaging is not the only hurdle for the fab’s American manufacturing operations. Another problem, and one that is directly related to semiconductor equipment stocks, relates to the different chemicals that are required throughout the chip manufacturing process. These chemicals include sulfuric acid, acetone, ammonium hydroxide, and others to ensure the purity of the silicon wafer throughout the fabrication process. However, according to a report from Macquarie Bank, since the Taiwanese fab relies on Taiwan-based firms for its chemical supply chain, the costs of manufacturing chips at the Arizona site could be 30% higher than in Taiwan. The higher costs stem from the fact that the chemical companies are hesitant to move to the US since they might be unable to enjoy economies of scale and the resulting cost benefits. The bank outlines that the lack of an American chemical supply chain that is qualified by the Taiwanese fab means that chemicals such as sulfuric acid might be costlier to ship internationally than their list price. Therefore, it’s clear that semiconductor equipment firms play an equally important role in chip fabrication. Another important example of this fact is the Dutch chip manufacturing machinery provider that ranked 9th on a recent list of AI news and ratings that Wall Street was watching. This firm is the only company in the world capable of manufacturing high-end chip-making tools called EUV scanners. Without these tools, firms such as the Taiwanese fab cannot make leading-edge chips with feature sizes smaller than 7-nanometer. In fact, the rising threat of China utilizing Western technologies for military use has also led the US government to stop the chip manufacturing equipment provider from selling its equipment to China’s Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC). The sanctions have dealt a sharp blow to Chinese chip manufacturing ambitions, with the latest chip from Huawei still being manufactured on the older 7-nanometer node. In contrast, the latest iPhone uses chips built through the 3-nanometer process technology. To make our list of the best semiconductor equipment stocks to buy, we ranked all US-listed semiconductor equipment stocks by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q3 2024 and picked out those with the highest number of investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A close up of a micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) package awaiting testing. Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 27 Amkor Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMKR) is an Arizona-based semiconductor equipment provider that provides semiconductor testing, packaging, and other associated services. Its shares are down 17% year-to-date, which is unsurprising even though packaging technologies have gained importance in the chip industry because of AI chips. Amkor Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMKR) depends to a large extent on the health of the smartphone industry. For the nine months ending in September, 49% of the firm’s revenue came from smartphones and communications devices. The market for these devices depends on consumer spending, and Amkor Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMKR)’s shares dropped by a massive 18% in July after the firm’s midpoint third-quarter EPS guidance of $0.49 missed analyst estimates of $0.65. Naturally, the smartphone market has to recover for the firm to benefit from tailwinds. Amkor Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMKR) has also won funding from the US government under the CHIPS Act for packaging, and it is also a TSMC partner for the Arizona site. Both these factors can help the firm in today’s AI-driven chip era. Amkor Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMKR)’s management commented on its TSMC deal during the Q3 2024 earnings call. Here is what they said: “First of all, the MOU that we signed with TSMC, now is that it’s intended to offer our mutual customers a seamless manufacturing supply chain and a technology offering between Asia and the US and by standardizing on advanced packaging technology in the US versus Asia that offers these joint customers a seamless transition for dual qualification of specific devices. And that will happen in our Peoria factory, it will be for the Compute segment, but also for the Communications segment technologies. Now we have to remember that our Peoria factory, our Arizona factory is not captive to TSMCs, but we will run TSMC technology in that factory, specifically for joint customers. Overall, AMKR ranks 10th on our list of best semiconductor equipment stocks to buy now. While we acknowledge the potential of AMKR as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMKR but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

BlackRock’s IBIT dominates Bitcoin ETF market with $54 billion in assets. Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States have now eclipsed gold ETFs in total assets, achieving this feat in less than a year of their launch. According to data from K33 Research, the combined assets of Bitcoin ETFs have reached $129.3 billion. Meanwhile, gold ETFs hold a slightly lower total of $128.9 billion. This shift highlights Bitcoin’s rapid rise in the ETF market, outpacing gold, which has enjoyed a two-decade advantage. Investor appetite for BTC ETFs has surged, especially following the success of pro-crypto candidate Donald Trump in the US elections on Nov. 5. The sector’s growth has been further fueled by consistent inflows, marked by a 13-day streak during which these ETFs attracted over $2 billion. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) leads the market with over $54 billion in assets. This figure is nearly double its iShares Gold Trust (IAU) holdings, underlining BTC’s growing dominance in the sector. Meanwhile, Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) and Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) also play significant roles, each managing approximately $22 billion in assets.

Title: Analysis-2024 the 'year of the bond' as record inflows top $600 billion
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/analysis2024-the-year-of-the-bond-as-record-inflows-top-600-billion-3776411
Time Published: 2024-12-17T11:12:51Z
Full Content:
By Harry Robertson LONDON (Reuters) -Investors have poured a record $600 billion into global bond funds this year, taking advantage of some of the highest yields in decades ahead of an uncertain 2025. Dwindling inflation has finally allowed central banks to lower interest rates, pushing investors to lock in the relatively high yields available and finally delivering the "year of the bond" after $250 billion left fixed-income funds in 2022. "The story is income," said Vasiliki Pachatouridi, head of EMEA iShares fixed income strategy at BlackRock (NYSE:BLK). "We are seeing the income being put back into fixed income. We haven't seen these levels of yields in almost 20 years." Bond yields tend to fall, and prices rise, as central banks reduce short-term borrowing costs. Although returns on the ICE BofA global bond index have been middling at around 2% this year, the yield on offer topped 4.5% late last year, the most since 2008. As of mid-December, $617 billion had flowed into developed and emerging market bond funds, according to financial data provider EPFR, topping 2021's $500 billion and putting 2024 on track to be a record year. Stocks, meanwhile, have drawn $670 billion of inflows as indexes in the U.S. and Europe scale new heights. Cash equivalent money market funds, which boast high yields and little risk, have fared the best, pulling in more than $1 trillion. CREDIT CRAZE Corporate bonds, which offer higher yields than equivalent government debt, have proven particularly popular, rallying as companies weathered the rise in central bank interest rates. The yield on the ICE BofA global corporate bond index has fallen to its lowest over risk-free government debt since before the financial crisis in 2007. "Before interest rates started to drift up a few years ago, a lot of companies locked in their funding for a long time," said Willem Sels, global chief investment officer at HSBC's private bank. "Therefore, the impact of rising borrowing costs on corporates was much less than people expected. At the same time, a lot of companies earned more on their cash holdings." PASSIVE AGGRESSIVE Investors have shown a clear preference for passive exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which were on track for a record year with $350 billion of inflows by the end of November, according to Morningstar Direct data. "ETFs give investors access to a number of assets that previously were harder to trade, including bonds," said Martin Oehmke, professor of finance at the London School of Economics. "Corporate bonds, for example, are notoriously illiquid and ETFs offer easy access to this market in a much more liquid form." The two biggest passive fund players - BlackRock and Vanguard - have reaped the benefits. BlackRock's iShares fixed income ETF business alone attracted $111 billion of inflows between January and the end of October, according to estimates from Morningstar Direct. Vanguard's bond funds took in an estimated $120 billion, the vast majority of which went to its index business which includes ETFs. PIMCO, traditionally known for its active management, has also had a strong year. It has drawn around $46 billion into its bond funds, according to Morningstar, after shedding some $80 billion in 2022. FLOWS COULD SLOW A number of factors could cause inflows to slow in 2025. President-elect Donald Trump's tax-cutting and deregulatory agenda has caused U.S. stocks to jump and inflows into equities to surge, limiting the appeal of bonds. Data from EPFR and TD Securities shows $117 billion flowed into U.S. stock funds in the four weeks after Trump's Nov. 5 victory, more than four times the $27 billion into global bonds. Meanwhile, investors are sceptical that corporate bonds can rally much further after this year's strong performance. "It seems very hard to continue to expect spreads to tighten much more, and I don't believe that bond yields will be much lower from where we are today," said Carl Hammer, global head of asset allocation at Swedish bank SEB.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best Weight Loss Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where AstraZeneca PLC (NASDAQ:AZN) stands against the other weight loss stocks. Most people have at some point sought to include weight loss and physical exercise in their daily life. The weight loss and fitness market is quite substantial worldwide since improving one's fitness can have direct physical and psychological benefits. Over one billion people worldwide—650 million adults, 340 million adolescents, and 39 million children—are obese, according to the WHO. A novel class of weight-loss medications that don't include strict exercise regimens or diets seems to be revolutionary. People who are overweight or obese can lose 15% to 20% of their body weight with the aid of these ground-breaking medications. According to Andy Acker, portfolio manager at Janus Henderson Investors, "This may be the largest opportunity we've ever seen in the pharmaceutical industry." Weight-loss medications are undoubtedly well-liked. Investors are drawing comparisons between the leader in artificial intelligence chips and the US pioneer in weight-loss drugs. Given this increase in demand, Morgan Stanley Research has raised its forecast for the worldwide obesity medication market from $77 billion to $105 billion by 2030. Branded obesity medications brought approximately $6 billion in 2023. According to Forbes, the most prescribed Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 GLP-1 agonist in 2023 was Semaglutide, the market leader for obesity medications and the generic form of Ozempic, Wegovy, and Rybelsus. It accounted for almost 88% of all new prescriptions. At present, the FDA has approved just three GLP-1 medications for weight control: tirzepatide, liraglutide, and semaglutide. By 2030, the GLP-1 market is expected to grow to $100 billion, driven equally by obesity and diabetes, according to JP Morgan Research. Thirty million GLP-1 users, or around 9% of the population, may be in the US by 2030. The rising demand for obesity drugs will have a broad effect, helping industries like biotech but creating challenges for others like the food and beverage industry. According to Chris Schott, a Senior Analyst specializing in the U.S. Diversified Biopharma industry, “GLP-1s have been used to treat T2D since 2005, starting with the approval of Byetta, with follow-on products continually improving on efficacy. The most recent, Ozempic and Mounjaro, offer significant advantages over previous products and have accelerated class growth,” “Indeed, the newest generations of GLP-1s and combos lead to 15-25+% weight loss on average, well above prior generations of products.” Some are praising the most recent generation of GLP-1 pharmaceuticals as "miracle drugs" for the treatment of obesity. However, because GLP-1s are expensive and have limited insurance coverage, not all obese people can use them. According to Jonathan Gruber, a professor of economics and the chairman of MIT's economics department, the annual cost of treating 40% of obese Americans at the current rate—roughly $15,000 per person—would surpass $1 trillion. That's almost the same as the government spends on the entire Medicare program. That's a staggering figure. According to a study released in the Annals of Internal Medicine, the use of GLP-1 medications, including semaglutide, for weight loss has increased over the last ten years, while it has dropped by about 10% among those with type 2 diabetes. The researchers warn that the ensuing extended drug scarcity may limit the treatments' availability to diabetics. Dr. Yee Hui Yeo, a clinical fellow in Cedars-Sina's Karsh Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, emphasized that it is crucial to ensure that diabetic patients have access to GLP-1 therapies as the demand for obesity medications increases. According to the FDA, growing demand is the cause of the shortages. The European Medicines Agency warned that the GLP-1 medicine shortage is a "major public health concern" that is unlikely to be resolved in 2024, indicating that the shortages affect more than only the US. According to NPR, shortages have made it difficult for those with diabetes to get their prescriptions, and some have had to reduce the medications they can use. The potential of GLP-1 medications, which were first created to treat diabetes but are currently being used to treat obesity, was covered by the panelists on "Weighing the Future of Obesity Drugs," which included Julia Angeles of Baillie Gifford, Debra Netschert of Jennison Investments, and Gentry Lee of Fayez Serofim. Netschert highlighted ongoing efforts to further reduce injection frequency and minimize adverse responses, as well as the development of GLP-1 medicine delivery from weekly dosages to multiple daily injections. Despite their exceptional efficacy, Netschert noted that due to supply limits, 1.5 million of the 110 million eligible patients in the US are now receiving therapy with GLP-1 medications. In their disagreement over who should foot the bill, Netschert pointed to significant insurance and Medicare/Medicaid reimbursements, while Angeles asserted that most patients pay cash. According to Netschert, up to 700 million people globally might require these medications outside of American borders. Notably, the panel found that GLP-1 medications were approved more quickly in the United Kingdom than in any other country, indicating their perceived value. The UK payors are generally stringent. Since the market for obesity medications is still in its infancy, it would be a good idea to add several weight reduction stocks to your watchlists. For this list, we scanned through holdings of weight loss ETFs and online rankings to form an initial list of 20 weight loss stocks. From that list, we picked 12 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund holders as of Q3 2024, based on data tracked by the Insider Monkey database. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 42 AstraZeneca PLC (NASDAQ:AZN) is a British-Swedish multinational biopharmaceutical company specializing in developing and manufacturing treatments for diseases such as cancer, respiratory conditions, cardiovascular issues, and autoimmune disorders. Its product portfolio includes biologics, vaccines, and prescription drugs like Tagrisso for lung cancer, Farxiga for diabetes and heart failure, and Symbicort for asthma and COPD. The company is among the largest pharmaceutical companies worldwide. AstraZeneca PLC (NASDAQ:AZN) is advancing in the weight loss and obesity treatment market with innovative drug candidates. AZD5004, an oral GLP-1 receptor agonist licensed from Eccogene, offers a convenient alternative to injectables. Phase I trials demonstrated safety at lower doses, with patients experiencing 5.8% weight loss and improved glucose levels. Now entering Phase IIb trials, AZD5004 is expected to generate $800 million in sales by 2032 due to its favorable tolerability and simplified manufacturing. These developments make AZN one of the best weight loss stocks on our list. AZD6234, a long-acting amylin receptor agonist, targets gastric emptying and appetite suppression, catering to patients intolerant to GLP-1 therapies. Phase I results showed weight loss with manageable side effects. The corporation is exploring its use in combination with AZD9550, a GLP-1/glucagon dual agonist, to enable once-weekly dosing and fat-selective weight loss, enhancing patient convenience and treatment efficacy. By developing oral treatments and combination therapies, AstraZeneca PLC (NASDAQ:AZN) aims to broaden its market presence and meet diverse patient needs in obesity care. As of Q3 2024, 42 hedge funds held shares in the company as tracked by the Insider Monkey database. The largest shareholder in the company was Fisher Asset Management with holdings worth $816.5 million. Analysts hold a consensus Strong Buy rating on the stock. Overall AZN ranks 9th on our list of the best weight loss stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of AZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best Weight Loss Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Viking Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:VKTX) stands against the other weight loss stocks. Most people have at some point sought to include weight loss and physical exercise in their daily life. The weight loss and fitness market is quite substantial worldwide since improving one's fitness can have direct physical and psychological benefits. Over one billion people worldwide—650 million adults, 340 million adolescents, and 39 million children—are obese, according to the WHO. A novel class of weight-loss medications that don't include strict exercise regimens or diets seems to be revolutionary. People who are overweight or obese can lose 15% to 20% of their body weight with the aid of these ground-breaking medications. According to Andy Acker, portfolio manager at Janus Henderson Investors, "This may be the largest opportunity we've ever seen in the pharmaceutical industry." Weight-loss medications are undoubtedly well-liked. Investors are drawing comparisons between the leader in artificial intelligence chips and the US pioneer in weight-loss drugs. Given this increase in demand, Morgan Stanley Research has raised its forecast for the worldwide obesity medication market from $77 billion to $105 billion by 2030. Branded obesity medications brought approximately $6 billion in 2023. According to Forbes, the most prescribed Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 GLP-1 agonist in 2023 was Semaglutide, the market leader for obesity medications and the generic form of Ozempic, Wegovy, and Rybelsus. It accounted for almost 88% of all new prescriptions. At present, the FDA has approved just three GLP-1 medications for weight control: tirzepatide, liraglutide, and semaglutide. By 2030, the GLP-1 market is expected to grow to $100 billion, driven equally by obesity and diabetes, according to JP Morgan Research. Thirty million GLP-1 users, or around 9% of the population, may be in the US by 2030. The rising demand for obesity drugs will have a broad effect, helping industries like biotech but creating challenges for others like the food and beverage industry. According to Chris Schott, a Senior Analyst specializing in the U.S. Diversified Biopharma industry, “GLP-1s have been used to treat T2D since 2005, starting with the approval of Byetta, with follow-on products continually improving on efficacy.

(NASDAQ:VKTX) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing therapies for metabolic and endocrine disorders. Its key products include VK2809 which is a thyroid hormone receptor beta agonist for lipid and metabolic disorders like NASH and NAFLD, and VK2735 which is a dual agonist for obesity and metabolic disorders.

(NASDAQ:VKTX) targets patients with obesity, liver diseases, and rare genetic conditions, planning to distribute its products through pharmaceutical channels once approved. In the third quarter of 2024, the company reported a net loss of $24.9 million, or $0.22 per share, an increase from the same period in 2023. This rise in losses was mainly due to higher research and development (R&D) and general and administrative (G&A) expenses. For the nine months ending September 30, 2024, the net loss totaled $74.5 million, or $0.69 per share, driven by similar factors. R&D expenses increased to $22.8 million in Q3 2024 from $18.4 million in Q3 2023, due to higher costs in drug manufacturing, salaries, benefits, and regulatory services. G&A expenses rose to $13.8 million from $8.9 million, largely driven by stock-based compensation, legal and patent services, and third-party consultancy. Despite these higher expenses, Viking Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:VKTX) significantly improved its financial position, with cash holdings of $930 million as of September 2024, up from $362 million at the end of 2023. This boost in cash reserves will support ongoing and future clinical trials. As of Q3 2024, 41 hedge funds held shares in the company, as tracked by the Insider Monkey database. The largest shareholder in the company was Artia Global Partners with shares worth $33.7 million. Viking Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:VKTX) has received a consensus Strong Buy rating from analysts, with a 12-month price target average of $115.80. The price target range spans from a low of $95.00 to a high of $164.00. The average target represents a 142.01% increase from the current price of $47.85. Overall VKTX ranks 10th on our list of the best weight loss stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of VKTX as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Title: Ethereum’s (ETH) Comeback Could Push Its Price to $5000 By the End of 2024, Rival also Positioned for a 31x ROI in 6 Weeks

Most Widely Read Newspaper Kindly share this story: Analysts are now predicting that Ethereum could rise back into the cryptocurrency market’s limelight and surpass its previous all time high of $4,850 in 2024. There are a number of factors driving this optimistic view including substantial market activity and increased institutional entreaty. With this, the accompanying RXS token, which targets real world assets (RWA) is also taking shape, setting the scene for impressive returns during the presale. Ethereum’s Meteoric Rise: Will ETH Hit $5,000 and Beyond in 2025? In the last few months, Ethereum (ETH) has been on an incredible rebound, taking off from a low of about $2,500 in October, to near $4,000 by the time we enter December. A number of key developments in the Ethereum ecosystem have been blamed for this surge. Also notable, the total value locked (TVL) in Ethereum’s decentralized finance (DeFi) projects set new all time highs, suggesting there’s a lot of activity and confidence amongst users. In addition, spot ETH exchange-traded funds (ETFs) injection also pulled in huge inflows to invigorate Ethereum’s market position. If Ethereum can hold ground and surge past these key resistance levels, analysts say it’s not unrealistic to see the digital asset reach $5,000 within the next few months. On the technical indicators side, ETH is still bullish as the digital asset remains above key moving averages that indicate that buying interest is likely to persist. Also, different experts in the market have the positive sentiment that Ethereum could be soaring to newer all time highs as far as early 2025. https://x.com/rovercrc/status/1865691790369554473 RXS and Ethereum: The Dynamic Duo Transforming Crypto Investment in 2025 Of course, Ethereum is taking the most attention, but the new token RXS, features its own innovative solution to integrating real world assets into the blockchain space. Runs on the Ethereum network and seeks to fill the gap between classic finance and the decentralized finance space by tokenizing real life physical assets. Therefore, RXS can be considered as a potentially lucrative investment opportunity due to its unique value proposition. RXS is currently in presale and has already made impressive traction. In the next stage, the token price is $0.125, yet before Stage 9 of its presale finishes, it will soar to $0.150. This asset backed token has raised over $25 million on the presale, demonstrating strong investor confidence and demand for this asset backed token. Analyst believe RXS stands for a significant price appreciation in the short term, estimating the ROI up to 31 times in six weeks. https://twitter.com/rexasfinance/status/1857692542290059502 Cryptocurrency market overall is on an uprise, lead from the investor’s interest and developments in the crypto regulatory space. Since institutional players are still entering the market, cryptocurrencies like Ethereum or projects like RXS will have the opportunity to gain from this injection of capital. However, major institutional investor purchases on Ethereum, such as from BlackRock, have propped up Ethereum’s recent price movements. Those endorsements not only furtherWebView the long term potential of Ethereum, but also drive retail investors to enter the space. Additionally, the demand for ETH is likely to rise, too, as more people participate with Ethereum’s ecosystem through decentralized applications (dApps) and NFTs. The fact this adoption is growing, however, will be critical to sustain upward price momentum and could fuel substantial prop up to see $5,000. This inherent synergy is bound to grow between these two tokens, as RXS continues its presale journey on the Ethereum blockchain. As a result of this infrastructure, Ethereum becomes RXS’s starting point as they take a new approach to asset management based on tokenization. This relationship strengthens RXS’s credibility and appeal to investors that are already well accustomed with Ethereum’s ability. As ETH and RXS are expected to make considerable gains in early 2025, with ETH likely to surpass new all time highs and RXS potentially multiplying its value, the upcoming period is looking very exciting for cryptocurrency investment. Conclusion: A Promising Outlook Ethereum and RXS looks to be in good shape as we head into 2025. Investors are closely watching Ethereum’s movement as the crypto is primed to break out above $5,000, aided by strong market dynamics coupled with institutional support. At the same time, RXS is developing into a compelling solution for those who seek to take advantage of creative financial offerings associated with actual world assets.

Those endorsements not only furtherWebView the long term potential of Ethereum, but also drive retail investors to enter the space. Additionally, the demand for ETH is likely to rise, too, as more people participate with Ethereum’s ecosystem through decentralized applications (dApps) and NFTs. The fact this adoption is growing, however, will be critical to sustain upward price momentum and could fuel substantial prop up to see $5,000. This inherent synergy is bound to grow between these two tokens, as RXS continues its presale journey on the Ethereum blockchain. As a result of this infrastructure, Ethereum becomes RXS’s starting point as they take a new approach to asset management based on tokenization. This relationship strengthens RXS’s credibility and appeal to investors that are already well accustomed with Ethereum’s ability.

Title: Bitcoin Hits Record High Against Gold: What It Means For BTC Price?
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-hits-record-high-against-gold-what-it-means-for-btc-price/
Time Published: 2024-12-17T05:30:37Z
Full Content:
Amid its historic price action, Bitcoin (BTC) has quietly hit a new all-time high (ATH) against gold. The insight was highlighted by veteran trader Peter Brandt in an X post. Brandt’s analysis revealed that the BTC-to-gold ratio has reached a new ATH of 32.19 ounces of gold per BTC. In his post, the seasoned trader also took a subtle dig at long-time gold advocate Peter Schiff, a vocal Bitcoin critic. For those unfamiliar, the BTC-to-gold ratio measures Bitcoin’s performance relative to gold, showing how many ounces of gold are needed to purchase one whole BTC. This metric underscores Bitcoin’s growing dominance as a store of value. Brandt further noted that the next target for Bitcoin is 89 ounces of gold per BTC, suggesting significant room for Bitcoin to grow against the precious metal. This aligns with the broader narrative within the crypto industry that Bitcoin is poised to challenge gold’s $15 trillion market cap. It’s worth recalling that Brandt previously predicted Bitcoin would rise 400% relative to gold by 2025. Back in October, he projected that BTC could reach the equivalent of 123 ounces of gold based on historical market patterns. A recent report by trading firm Bernstein added weight to this narrative, forecasting that Bitcoin is on track to replace gold as the preferred safe-haven asset within the next 10 years. As of now, BTC boasts a market cap of $2.11 trillion, steadily closing in on gold’s dominance. Similar forecast was made by one of the earliest Bitcoin advocates, Eric Voorhees. The CEO of ShapeShift crypto exchange made a bold prediction, saying that unlike gold or oil, BTC’s digitally-programmed supply scarcity will drive its price upwards. Additionally, Nate Geraci, President of the ETF Store, predicts that Bitcoin-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) could surpass gold ETFs in total assets under management within the next two years. Supporting this outlook, data from SoSoValue indicates that cumulative net inflows into all spot BTC ETFs currently stand at $35.6 billion, compared to gold ETFs, which sit at $55 billion. With BTC surpassing the pivotal $100,000 price level, speculation has grown regarding President-elect Donald Trump’s approach to digital assets. Industry experts believe that Trump may prioritize Bitcoin adoption early in his second term, further boosting BTC’s price. Data supports this optimistic view. According to crypto analyst Ali Martinez, the number of BTC whales – wallet addresses holding more than 1,000 BTC – has skyrocketed since Trump’s election victory. This optimism is further fuelled by speculation surrounding a potential US strategic Bitcoin reserve. Prominent financiers argue that if the US were to create such a reserve, China and other nations would likely follow suit to remain competitive. At press time, BTC trades at $106,909, up 3.7% in the past 24 hours.

Title: Does BlackRock own 30% of farmland in Ukraine?! | Tech ARP

Time Published: 2024-12-17T02:23:41Z

Does BlackRock now own 30% of farmland in Ukraine?! Take a look at the viral claim, and find out what the facts really are! Some people are claiming or suggesting that BlackRock now owns 30% of farmland in Ukraine! Wide Awake Media / 1minuterantzz (deleted) : [Ukraine] was one of the biggest agricultural and farming producers globally… Now, 30% of its farmland has been sold off.” “And that has been sold off to three companies… The major shareholder and owner of those three companies… is BlackRock.” “So BlackRock effectively now owns 30% of the farmland in Ukraine.” “Meanwhile, by complete coincidence, laws and new taxes have been brought in in the UK, which… are going to lead to pockets of our farmland having to be sold off… The only way [farmers] can pay those taxes is to sell off… their land.” “Who are they going to sell it to? Big corporations.” “I wonder, could that possibly be BlackRock? Or could it possibly be the now biggest private land owner in the whole of the USA, Bill Gates?” Recommended : Did NATO announce plan for sneak attack on Russia?! This is yet another example of fake news circulating on TikTok and X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, and here are the reasons why… BlackRock does not own 30% of farmland in Ukraine BlackRock is a public-listed company, and that means its assets and accounts are not only audited and publicly disclosed, they must also publicly announce material information, which would include buying up large swathes of farmland in any country. If BlackRock does indeed own 30% of farmland in Ukraine, it would be a matter of public record, and would likely have sparked some outrage in Ukraine. Yet, there are no records of BlackRock purchasing or owning 30% of farmland in Ukraine. Unsurprisingly, people making these claims have never provided any evidence BlackRock purchased or owns 30% of farmland in Ukraine. Ukraine forbids foreign ownership of farmland It would be impossible for BlackRock, or any foreign company, to purchase farmland in Ukraine, as Ukrainian law forbids foreign ownership of farmland! As The Sofia Globe explained: Ukraine’s Land Act states in its article 1 that “land is the prime national asset and is under the special protection of the state.” According to the law agricultural land in the country can be owned only by Ukrainian citizens, companies whose ownership is wholly in the hands of Ukrainian citizens, as well as by local councils and the state. Article 130 prohibits foreign citizens, stateless persons or legal entities from acquiring shares in companies or being members on organisations that own agricultural land. The law says also that those restrictions on land ownership can only be removed through a referendum. Between 1992 and 2021 a moratorium on the trade in agricultural land was in place in Ukraine. It did not allow any land sales, even between Ukrainian citizens. Recommended : Is Biden Admin planning to transfer nuclear weapons to Ukraine?! Even after the moratorium on the sale of agricultural land was lifted in 2021, only Ukrainian citizens and companies could buy or sell farmland. This was confirmed by the US State Department’s 2021 investment climate report on Ukraine: Foreign and domestic private entities can engage in all forms of remunerative activity, with some exceptions: foreign companies are restricted from owning agricultural land, producing bioethanol, and some publishing activities. It is therefore impossible for BlackRock, or any foreign entity, to own 30% of all farmland in Ukraine. Ukraine would have to change its law before any foreigner, or foreign company, can buy agricultural land in Ukraine. Even China could only lease Ukrainian land Even China could only lease 3 million hectares (7.4 million acres) of Ukrainian agriculture land in 2013, for about $2.6 billion per year. And it did so by leasing land owned by Ukrainian government-controlled agricultural company KSG Agro. The farmland would be used mainly to grow crops and raise pigs for the Chinese market. I should point out that massive lease involved less than 10% of farmland in Ukraine. It would be impossible for any country or entity to lease 20% to 30% of farmland in Ukraine without public disclosure. Needless to say – there are no reports of BlackRock leasing large swathes of Ukrainian farmland either! Ukraine invited BlackRock to invest in post-war reconstruction In May 2023, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with BlackRock’s leadership. The Ukrainian government invited the asset management company to participate in an investment fund for the future reconstruction of Ukraine. The investment fund not only involves other multinational companies like JP Morgan, and McKinsey, it does not involve foreign ownership of Ukrainian farmland. In addition, this fund is to meant to rebuild Ukraine after the war with Russia ends. In short – even if BlackRock participates in this Ukraine reconstruction fund, it won’t give the company ownership of 30% of farmland in Ukraine.

Title: Deep State Officials Opposing Tulsi Gabbard’s Nomination Have Deep Ties To Defense Contractors, Censorship

Full Content:
Numerous officials that signed a letter opposing Tulsi Gabbard’s nomination for Director of National Intelligence (DNI) are tied to groups targeting “election misinformation,” left-wing organizations, intelligence agencies and defense contractors. Certain members of Foreign Policy for America, the group behind the letter, are linked to entities from Lockheed Martin to George Soros’s Open Society Foundations. Nearly 100 national security officials published a letter calling for a “thorough vetting” of Gabbard, and it was addressed to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and soon-to-be Majority Leader John Thune. Former Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman criticized Gabbard’s views on the Russia-Ukraine war, former head of U.S. counterintelligence Joel Brenner blasted the nomination as “an insult to our intelligence agencies,” and former Senior CIA officer Melvin Gamble said her nomination “should worry any American who cares about keeping our country safe.” But these very same people are part of the cohort of intelligence officials President-elect Donald Trump has signaled he wants to remove from power. FP4A & nearly 100 national security leaders call on the Senate to thoroughly vet Tulsi Gabbard’s nomination for Director of National Intelligence. Her qualifications & past statements raise serious concerns about her ability to serve in this critical role. Full letter here ⬇️ — Foreign Policy for America (@FP4America) December 4, 2024 “This is a perfect example of why President Trump chose Tulsi Gabbard for this position,” Gabbard’s transition spokeswoman Alexa Henning told the Daily Caller. (RELATED: ‘National Security’ Officials Who Endorsed Harris Tied To Intel Agencies, Defense Contractors) “These unfounded attacks are from the same geniuses who have blood on their hands from decades of faulty ‘intelligence,’ including the non-existent weapons of mass destruction. These intel officials continue to use classification as a partisan weapon to smear and imply things about their political enemy without putting the facts out.” U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s nominee to be Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard (R) walks with Sen. Joni Ernst (R-IA) to the Russell Senate Office Building on December 09, 2024 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images) Much of the group’s criticism levied at Gabbard centered around her 2017 meeting with then-Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Much of that criticism has been absent for Democratic California Rep. Nancy Pelosi, who also met with Assad in 2007. Sherman, for her part, previously criticized Trump for attempting to remove U.S. troops from Syria in 2018. Asaad fled the country and escaped to Russia after the oppositional coalition Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) overthrew his regime last week. HTS is considered a terrorist organization by many of the world’s governments, including the United States. The group’s leader, Abu Mohammed al-Golani, was previously a leader of an al-Qaeda affiliate in the country. The Daily Caller is working to be your voice in the swamp.

She was his Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs and played a key role in negotiating the Iran nuclear deal. The Obama administration unfroze nearly $2 billion in assets for the Iranian regime in 2016. Rose Gottemoeller, Joel Brenner, and Brian P. McKeon all served in the Obama administration and slammed Gabbard’s nomination. President Obama launched a CIA program in 2013 aimed at removing Assad, but it was ultimately a failure, and Trump ended the program in 2017. Gabbard called Assad a “brutal dictator” in an interview with CNN in 2019, and has defended the meeting as a means of preventing America from being involved in foreign entanglements. “He’s a brutal dictator. Just like Saddam Hussein. Just like Gaddafi in Libya,” Gabbard told CNN. Far from hurting Tulsi Gabbard’s confirmation chances, this week’s events prove out her contention a decade ago that Al Qaeda would be the chief beneficiary of regime change in Syria.

Sherman currently serves as a senior fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School’s Belfer Center. Former Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security, John Tien, also signed the letter and is a senior fellow at the Belfer Center. The Belfer Center was involved in the Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Agency’s (CISA) training seminars on election “disinformation,” according to a CISA “Disinformation in 2020” YouTube video. The CISA relied on the Center’s “Defending Digital Democracy Project” (D3P), which is led by former Army intelligence officer Eric Rosenbach, and Hillary Clinton and Mitt Romney’s former campaign managers. The Belfer Center also partnered with The National Democratic Institute (NDI) and The International Republican Institute (IRI) to tackle “misinformation in elections,” both of which are funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), according to USA Spending. 6.

In September 2024, it had an event on “free and fair elections” about “threats of foreign interference, disinformation, [and] political violence.” Former Chief of Staff of the Commission Security and Cooperation in Europe, Alex T. Johnson, signed the letter and was senior policy advisor for Europe and Eurasia at George Soros’s Open Society Foundations until February 2019. Aside from ties to left-wing organizations combating “disinformation,” some of the members are linked to defense contractors or groups funded by them.

Tulsi’s life exemplifies a rare blend of selflessness, courage, and leadership—qualities desperately needed to reform and strengthen our intelligence community,” their letter reads.

Title: Jim Cramer on Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD): ‘I Think It’s A Buy Ahead Of The Meeting’

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer's Bold Predictions About These 15 Tech Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) stands against the other tech stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about. Like all of us, Jim Cramer is always wondering what's next for the stock market. So far, the year has seen AI continue to dominate the market, accompanied by the Federal Reserve and the 2024 US Presidential Election. Now, with the election over and investors pondering over the incoming administration's tariff policies, like us, Cramer is also focused on the Federal Reserve. The reason why the Fed and tariffs are related is because the latter can cause inflation to force the former to keep interest rates higher for longer. While it tries to decipher what's ahead for AI, Wall Street is also wondering about the pace, magnitude, and frequency of the Federal Reserve's 2025 interest rate cut cycle. This nervousness is reflected in bond yields touching 4.38% on Friday, and asset manager Apollo Global warning that four key inflation indicators appear to be reaccelerating. As per Apollo, the Core CPI, the Core PCE, the Supercore CPI, and the Supercore CPE have all started to rise again. In Mad Money aired last week, Cramer also had the Fed in mind. Cramer, in his show, commented on the nervousness in the market. The television show host wondered why the stock market wasn't responding to semiconductor stocks doing well. He started out by sharing that "I hate the endless focus on the Fed. By everybody. Because it detracts you from benefiting from long-term performance for your stock portfolio." This is because Cramer believes that "every little signal from the Federal Reserve brings out predictions, causing many people to sell good stocks when they are freaked out." He did add that the economic data shows that there will be dissent at the Federal Reserve when it comes to further reducing interest rates at the upcoming December meeting. Cramer shared that "while I don't think the data is cool enough to be positive about the prospects of more cuts for now, I also don't want you to make decisions purely on what the Fed does. Contrary to popular belief, there's more to investing than monetary policy. And I wish everyone knew that. They don't." On the topic of tariffs, Cramer had plenty to share in November. He started out by analyzing the performance of the benchmark S&P index between mid-2017 and the start of 2020. Cramer pointed out that "this is where we start to get the real tariff action from the first Trump administration." He shared that "Trump imposed tariffs on steel, aluminum, solar panels, and washing machines among other goods." While "all these helped the industries in question . . .the broader market didn't like that we were triggering a global trade war." Cramer pointed out the index's performance between January 22nd and December 24th, 2018 to bolster the view that tariffs weren't great for the stock market. However, before you write them off, consider his remarks. According to Cramer, during this time period, "the S&P 500 lost 18% of its value. Of course, some of that is because the Fed got much more aggressive about raising interest rates through this period. Taking them up. a 100 basis points that year. But it definitely wasn't just the Fed. You can see from the chart that virtually every time we got more tariffs, the S&P would roll over, every time China retaliated, we'd sell off." Yet, according to Cramer, "once the Fed decided to stop tightening at the very end of 2018, the S&P was finally able to find a floor." Following this, the market "rebounded like crazy" as part of a "bullish trading cycle, one that continued until Covid hit in 2020. Long story short, the market couldn't handle the trade war when the Fed was tightening. But as soon as the Fed started easing, all those losses evaporated." Using charts from Jessica Inskip, Cramer compared the last intersection of the Fed and Trump tariffs with today's environment. He outlined that the "Fed is now our friend." Why is that so? Well, according to Cramer, as soon as the Fed stopped tightening, the market "stopped reacting as aggressively to the trade war." He shared that Inskip believes that "something like a trade war can certainly hurt us badly when the market's already trending bearishly. But if we've got a bullish trading cycle like we do right now, then she's not worried as long as we can maintain this cycle." So, as Cramer remains cautiously optimistic about the stock market's future, we decided to see how his views about stocks have stood the test of time. Our Methodology To make our list of the 15 stocks Jim Cramer has made bold predictions about, we compiled his statements about top tech stocks and ranked them by the date the statements were made. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A close up of a complex looking PCB board with several intergrated semiconductor parts. Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 104 Date of Cramer's Comments: 10-04-24 Chip designer Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)'s CEO Dr. Lisa Su was nominated as Time Magazine's CEO of the year in December. In October, Cramer was also full of praise for the executive who has capitalized on Intel's troubles to carve out a place for it in the data center industry and grow PC market share. According to him: “Not to be outdone, Lisa Su, the CEO of AMD, will hold an analyst day and it’s entitled Advancing AI 2024. It starts at noon. Today, when the stock was plummeting, I told investing club members at my 10:20 morning meeting that Su’s presentation could show this charitable trust holding in a whole new light, even as they’ve been raising their AI sales forecast quarter after quarter after quarter. I think it’s a buy ahead of the meeting, although the stock did run eight points after we talked about it at the morning meeting.” Since his remarks, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)'s shares have lost a whopping 22%. The bearishness is built on the firm's third-quarter earnings and a BofA downgrade. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)'s stature as a growth stock meant that when it guided $7.5 billion in revenue for the current quarter, which was in-line with analyst estimates, investors were spooked that it would be unable to capitalize on AI growth. Then, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)'s shares fell by 5.6% after BofA downgraded it to Neutral from Buy and slashed the price target to $155 from $180 as it grew wary of a growth in PC sales in 2025. Overall AMD ranks 13th on our list of the tech stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about. While we acknowledge the potential of AMD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: U.S. could see crypto policy blitz in 2025 in spite of risks

The new year will usher in the bitcoin-friendly administration of President-elect Donald Trump and an expanding lobbying effort in statehouses that, together, could push states to become more open to crypto and for public pension funds and treasuries to buy into it. Proponents of the uniquely volatile commodity argue it is a valuable hedge against inflation, similar to gold. Many bitcoin enthusiasts and investors are quick to criticize government-backed currencies as prone to devaluation and say increased government buy-in will stabilize bitcoin's future price swings, give it more legitimacy and further boost an already rising price. But the risks are significant. Critics say a crypto investment is highly speculative, with so much unknown about projecting its future returns, and warn that investors should be prepared to lose money. Only a couple public pension funds have invested in cryptocurrency and a new U.S. Government Accountability Office study on 401(k) plan investments in crypto, issued in recent days, warned it has “uniquely high volatility” and that it found no standard approach for projecting the future returns of crypto. It has already been a landmark year for crypto, with bitcoin hitting $100,000, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approving the first exchange-traded funds that hold bitcoin and crypto enthusiasts being cheered by Trump's promise to make the United States the “bitcoin superpower” of the world. Lawmakers in more states can expect to see bills in 2025 to make them crypto-friendly as analysts say crypto is becoming a powerful lobby, bitcoin miners build new installations and venture capitalists underwrite a growing tech sector that caters to cryptocurrencies. Meanwhile, a new crypto-friendly federal government under Trump and Congress could consider legislation from Sen. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyoming, to create a federal bitcoin reserve on which states can piggyback. A bill introduced last month in Pennsylvania's House of Representatives sought to authorize the state's treasurer and public pension funds to invest in bitcoin. It went nowhere before the legislative session ended, but it caused a stir. “I had a friend who is a rep down the road text me, ‘Oh my god, I’m getting so many emails and phone calls to my office,' more than he ever did about any other bill,” said the measure's sponsor, Republican Mike Cabell. Cabell — a bitcoin enthusiast who lost his reelection bid — expects his bill to be reintroduced by a colleague. And leaders of bitcoin advocacy group Satoshi Action say they expect bills based on their model bill to be introduced in at least 10 other states next year. Keith Brainard, research director for the National Association of State Retirement Administrators, said he doesn’t expect many public pension fund investment professionals, who oversee nearly $6 trillion in assets, to invest in crypto. Pension fund professionals take risks they deem to be appropriate, but bitcoin investing has a short track record, might only fit into a niche asset class and may not fit the risk-to-reward profile they seek. “There might be a bit of dabbling in bitcoin,” Brainard said. “But it’s difficult to envision a scenario in which pension funds right now are willing to make a commitment.” In Louisiana, Treasurer John Fleming helped make the state the first to introduce a system by which people can pay a government agency in cryptocurrencies. Fleming said he's not trying to promote cryptocurrency, but rather sees the step as a recognition that government must innovate and be flexible in helping people make financial transactions with the state. He said he would never invest his money, or the state's, in crypto. Fleming recalled meeting with a bitcoin lobbyist recently and came away unconvinced that bitcoin makes for a good investment. “My concern is that at some point it’ll stop growing and then people will want to cash in,” Fleming said. “And when they do, it could tank the value of a bitcoin.” In Pennsylvania, Treasury Department officials said they have the authority to decide for themselves if cryptocurrencies meet the agency's investment standards under state law and don't need new legislation. Still, a highly volatile asset is ill-suited to the agency's need for predictability, considering it writes millions of checks a year. The overwhelming majority of the roughly $60 billion it invests at any given time is in short-term, conservative investments designed for an investment period of months, officials there said. Pension boards, which invest on a 30-year time horizon, may already hold small investments in companies involved in mining, trading and storing cryptocurrencies. But they have been slow to embrace bitcoin. That could change, said Mark Palmer, managing director and a senior research analyst at The Benchmark Company in New York. Pension boards got investment tools they like this year when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved the first exchange-traded funds that hold bitcoin and, in October, approved listings of options on those funds, Palmer said. Many “are likely in the process of getting up to speed on what it means to invest in bitcoin and kicking the tires, so to speak, and that’s a process that typically takes a while at the institutional level,” Palmer said. Several major asset managers like BlackRock, Invesco and Fidelity have bitcoin ETFs. In May, the State of Wisconsin Investment Board became the first state to invest when it bought $160 million worth of shares in two ETFs, or about 0.1% of its assets. It later scaled back that investment to $104 million in one ETF, as of Sept. 30. A spokesperson declined to discuss it. Michigan's state investment board later reported about $18 million in bitcoin ETF purchases while a candidate for New Jersey governor, Steven Fulop, said that if elected he would push the state's pension fund to invest in crypto. Fulop, the Democratic mayor of Jersey City, just across the Hudson River from Manhattan, has been preparing for months to buy bitcoin ETF shares for up to 2% of the city's $250 million employee pension fund. “We were ahead of the curve," Fulop said. “And I think that’s what you’re eventually going to see is this is widely accepted, with regard to exposure in all pension funds, some sort of exposure.” Uncover a different side of Japan this winter in Akita! 👹 Read More Study Abroad agency hiring for an Admin role- apply now!

Venture capital in the U.S. has moved to artificial intelligence (AI) companies at an “unprecedented” rate, HSBC Innovation Banking said Monday (Dec. 16). The scale of capital invested in AI companies by U.S. venture investors is approaching that allocated to the rest of the venture market, the firm said in a Monday press release outlining findings from Innovation Horizons, its latest quarterly outlook for the U.S. technology sector. Forty-two percent of U.S. venture capital was invested into AI companies in 2024, up from 36% in 2023 and 22% in 2022, according to the report. The report also found that as of 2024, 20 AI companies have each raised $2 billion or more. “Venture capital has always gravitated toward transformative industries, but the level of consolidation we’re seeing within one category is unprecedented,” HSBC U.S. Innovation Banking Head Dave Sabow said in the release. “The radical change this investment will fuel places us in the dawn of ‘The Agentic Age,’ an era where autonomous artificial intelligence capabilities fundamentally redefine how we communicate, work and interface with digital and physical worlds.” Investment giant BlackRock said Dec. 7 that it expects 2025 to be a big year for infrastructure and cybersecurity, with the AI boom playing a major role in those investments. “It’s still very early in the AI adoption cycle,” Jay Jacobs, BlackRock’s U.S. head of thematic and active ETFs, told CNBC in a Dec. 7 report. Jacobs added that AI firms need to build out their data centers and that protecting that data will likely be a wise investment. The HSBC report came on the same day that SoftBank said it will invest $100 billion in the U.S. over the next four years, focusing on AI and related infrastructure. HSBC Innovation Banking also found in its report that R&D spending from the so-called Magnificent 7 companies totaled more than all the dollars invested in U.S. startups in 2024, according to the release. The Magnificent 7 are Tesla, Nvidia, Microsoft, Meta, Apple, Amazon and Alphabet. The firm also said in the release that it expects the U.S. tech sector to see new waves of growth and tailwinds for returns resulting from expected changes in the acquisition market, deregulation and fiscal policies that stimulate economic activity. We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

Title: Vera Wang, WHP Global Discuss New Chapter for the 35-year-old Lifestyle Brand

Today's Digital Daily Today's Digital Daily Vera Wang and WHP Global's Yehuda Shmidman talk about new opportunities in global markets and sectors like hospitality. News Director “It’s exciting. Who would have thunk it?” said Vera Wang Monday morning after a deal for WHP Global to acquire her 35-year-old luxury lifestyle brand was revealed. In a telephone interview with Wang and Yehuda Shmidman, chairman and chief executive officer of WHP Global, the two spoke animatedly about plans for the future, and where they see the business headed. Hospitality was high on Wang’s list of growth opportunities. Wang said she wasn’t necessarily actively looking for an investor, but “probably I’ve been searching to expand my brand throughout my whole career and my whole company life.” You May Also Like Related Articles Handbags Maison Marrain Crafts Luxe Handbags for Work and Wine Eye Scoops W Hotels Taps Chloë Sevigny, Miranda Makaroff for New Brand Campaign “I’ve got to be honest: I felt it was the perfect time for Yehuda and for me and for our brand — the synergy and his belief in me. They are in a full growth mode, and I mean it. Frankly, I know that we’ve generated a lot of branding over the past six or seven years, and I think it’s the perfect time for me to execute in ways that I could not have done before. With their enormous support, this gives me an opportunity to grow in a way that I could never have done on my own,” said Wang. Founded in 1990, Wang’s brand today generates over $700 million in annual retail sales across categories including women’s apparel, bridal, men’s tuxedos and suiting, fine jewelry, fragrance, and home, among others. “In all fairness, you need financing and a level of expertise, and also energy, in the sense of desire and passion. All these things are things that Yehuda has in spades,” said Wang. WHP Global is a global management firm that was cofounded by Shmidman in 2019 with the help of funds managed by Oaktree Capital Management, Ares Management, Solus Alternative Assets Management, and BlackRock. Its portfolio of brands runs the gamut from Bonobos, Joe’s Jeans, Rag & Bone and G-Star to Anne Klein, Joseph Abboud, Isaac Mizrahi, Warners, Toys “R” Us and Babies “R” Us. Shmidman told WWD: “This is the quintessential ‘1 + 1 equals 5.’ What Vera built is one of a kind, what the Vera Wang brand is is one of a kind and Vera Wang is a legend and one of a kind. We’re combining with an infrastructure of over $7 billion in sales, and we’re active in over 50 countries,” he added. Shmidman said he and Wang have been talking about going global in Latin America, Asia and the Middle East, to which Wang interjected: “We’ve been global, people don’t really realize that. We’ve been in China for 25 years. We’ll have eight freestanding bridal stores with our partner in China. [There are seven right now]. We have had seven stores in Japan for probably 20 years.” For the past 35 years Wang said her business has been self-financed, although she has had retail partners. In 2006, Wang held acquisition discussions with companies such as Liz Claiborne Inc. and St. John, before striking a lucrative licensing deal with Kohl’s for Simply Vera, Vera Wang in 2007. Wang, a shrewd negotiator, is known for taking her time before striking deals. Asked what attracted him to the Vera Wang brand, Shmidman gave a one-word answer: “Everything.” He said he’s admired and studied the brand for some time. “Vera’s already built the brand in many countries, and there’s still so much more growth potential. When you think of the global industry of fashion and what Vera Wang represents to people and the emotional connection to people, this is all about the future. It’s all about what we can do together,” he said. He said Wang will not only continue as founder and chief creative officer of her brand, but she will be “an important shareholder of WHP Global.” Citing opportunities for the brand, Shmidman said when one thinks about the DNA of Wang’s business, everyone will say bridal. “There are so many aspects of fashion already built, and more to come, and of course, there’s home, but there’s more,” he said. Wang added that she’s been in hard home and soft home for years, with a thriving business in sheets and towels, “not only at Kohl’s but at Macy’s.” She also has a licensing deal with Waterford Wedgwood. “The future of that is still gift registry and bridal registry and the amount of product we continue to create in crystal, plates, bone china, and silver. All these things have been going on forever,” said Wang. Wang revealed that one of the biggest opportunities in their plans is hospitality. “That’s one of the most important categories that I could never tackle. I’ve had piecemeal offers,” she said. Wang said she’s had a branded suite at the Halekulani in Hawaii for over 15 years. And there were times in her life when she almost did a deal in Singapore for a Vera Wang hotel and chapels for weddings. “I’ve had a lot of stuff going on for 35 years, it was never was the right time and situation for me. But my first concern always was my core company and competency. This [deal] enables me to begin to explore other areas that I could never possibility get to,” said Wang. Wang said she’d like to do hotels, some which could be bridal-oriented and some style-oriented. She likes to be local and bring a modern style sensibility to whatever country she’s in while respecting their heritage. “I’ve had so much experience in Italy and France, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Taiwan, Bangkok…. I just feel there’s a lot to offer there. Of course, bridal is a bit of a tease, but I think it’s a very important part of hospitality. I don’t know a hotel opening right now that doesn’t want to attract a huge event. There are very few that are bigger than bridal,” she said. Asked if she’d like to sign a license for high-end ready-to-wear, Wang was game. “That could happen, right, Yehuda? That will happen,” said Wang. Shmidman added, “The reality is the opportunities are almost endless in the best of ways. What begins in bridal extends to all fashion, expands to all home, lifestyle, and now you’re the first person to hear about the vision into hospitality.” Asked if the Vera Wang staff will remain intact, Shmidman said that they’ve signed the deal but haven’t closed yet. All the details and particulars will be forthcoming post-closing, which is expected in the new year. When he was specifically asked about his modus operandi when he takes over a company, such as Rag & Bone, and whether the infrastructure remains intact, Shmidman said it does. “Everything is about growth; what is amazing that it’s already built and how do we expand and grow?” He said WHP in the past six years has gone from zero to over $7 billion. “With Vera and other initiatives I wouldn’t be surprised if we surpass $8 billion next year.” The company has five offices around the world. Wang believes she has created a company that’s unique for a fashion company. “It’s emotional. We are an emotional company. We dress women on the most important days of their lives for their public — their friends, their family, their relatives. I don’t mean that giving birth to your first child isn’t emotional, I’m saying for your most public moment. When you think of the amount of weddings I have done at all price points, over 35 years, I can honestly say as an ex-skater, that I win the Olympic gold medal for the amount of weddings I attended, the amount of brides I have dressed. We’re truly based on a sense of romance and a sense of commitment and optimism. The most optimistic thing you do is to get married,” said Wang. Wang said she’ll continue to pursue deals at both the high-end and for stores such as Kohl’s and Zales. She just signed new initiatives with Jared and Zales, and has new fragrances in the works with Coty. “This is an opportunity for me to flex what’s it’s taken for me to build a company. I had no investors, and I did this self-funded, and I had no partners until now. And you know better than I how difficult it is,” said Wang. She said this is her 55th year in fashion, she just had her 75th birthday, and this is her 35th year in business. “These three milestones were this year,” said Wang, who had to leave the call because she had to take a call with the White House. Asked what that was about, she said, “I have no idea. It’s anybody’s guess.” Consultants think the acquisition makes sense for both parties. Robert Burke, chairman and CEO of Robert Burke Associates, said, “They [WHP] are really trying to go after a premium brand portfolio like Rag & Bone, G-Star and Joe’s Jeans. What’s unique about Vera’s business is that she’s always been very focused on being a lifestyle brand and a brand that has the potential for licensing. She was very early on with the mattress deal and the Lenox tabletop. She tapped into that bridal market and realized it was multifaceted. If she couldn’t make it, she partnered with someone who could. “She’s still the most internationally recognized label in bridal, hands-down. I think there’s still a great deal of room for her brand to grow,” said Burke. Andrew Jassin, managing director of Jassin Consulting Group, said, “Stuart [Kreisler, director of Jassin Consulting Group] and I have had a long relationship with Vera Wang. We are the ones that created the licenses for fine jewelry, and wine and prosecco, as well as with some other extensions. Though Vera Wang has many successful licensing partnerships, we believe that Vera Wang has been relatively conservative in its licensing. I think it is a brilliant move by WHP; Vera Wang is a truly global brand with incredible consumer connectivity. WHP will extend the Vera Wang bandwidth via their professional licensing and management team. This is a win-win for everyone involved.” Sign up for WWD news straight to your inbox every day Get all the top news stories and alerts straight to your inbox.

Innovation and business go hand in hand — and that's constantly on enterprise leaders' minds, regardless of their industry. Executives must understand how technological advancements, systemic barriers, and generational shifts are affecting their growth, then strategize accordingly. Business Insider's annual list of people transforming business highlights these leaders who work in media, finance, technology, transportation, and labor. The WNBA's first female commissioner, Cathy Engelbert, is spearheading a transformation in the sports sector with her focus on fan engagement and equity among players. In finance, Leon Sinclair is leveraging data and analytics to reshape the world of alternative investments at Preqin, where he's an executive vice president. Mike Hopkins, the head of Amazon's Prime Video and MGM Studios, is forging an ad-focused entertainment-business strategy that could redefine how content is made and consumed in the digital age. Below, in alphabetical order by first name, are the 10 business leaders our reporters and editors credit with shaking up and remolding their industries. Employers often say they prefer to hire employees who act like owners. As the executive director of the nonprofit Ownership Works, Miller aims to get employers to act on that ethos. "It's not credible to ask employees to feel, think, and act like owners if you don't give them a financial ownership stake," Miller said. Since its founding in 2021, Ownership Works and its corporate partners have shared $570 million in wealth across six companies and worked with more than 160,000 workers at 113 companies. One way Miller seeks to convince business owners of the merits of employee shareholding is by showing them how it can improve the bottom line. She pointed to a time an employee in an Ownership Works company helped their employer save money by replacing a component costing $100 with a 3D printed part that cost just a few dollars. "They often know where the company is losing money or making a mistake or where things could be better," Miller said. "And they often have ideas for how to fix the problem. It's just nobody ever asked them to." Miller's career in employee ownership grew out of an interest in community development. Early in her career she helped a nonprofit in Hawaii create farming cooperatives, and she worked with another nonprofit to convert small businesses into worker cooperatives. Miller said she wanted to find scale, so she approached Pete Stavros, KKR's cohead of private equity. Stavros first experimented with employee ownership at a garage-door manufacturer in 2015, leading to some of KKR's best results. He was looking to spread that model further. After announcing the creation of Ownership Works with a $10 million donation, Stavros hired Miller as his first employee. Now it's her job to help the company's 35 private-equity partners, including KKR and Apollo, institute plans in their portfolios. She does this in part by partnering with accountants, lawyers, and professional-services firms to make it easier to create these plans, acting as an employee-ownership consultancy. The organization also collects and shares metrics of success, such as hundreds of millions of dollars in grants to employees and decreasing turnover and higher profits at companies with employee ownership. She's helping the nonprofit expand beyond private equity. Ownership Works recently worked with the cold-storage company Lineage to give $100 million in IPO proceeds to its employees and create a stock-ownership plan. Miller believes that expanding employee ownership could significantly narrow the wealth gap and reduce financial insecurity. Sadoun said he mostly received pushback when, in 2017, he told creative agencies that the future of creativity was commerce and AI. "It's funny when you look at what happened now," Sadoun, the chief executive of the French advertising giant Publicis Groupe, told BI. Back then, Sadoun faced a daunting task. He had just taken over as the third-ever leader of the 91-year-old company, home to the storied agencies Leo Burnett, Saatchi & Saatchi, and Publicis Conseil, which had created iconic advertising like the Marlboro Man, Tony the Tiger, and "Labour Isn't Working." But Publicis was languishing behind its competitors having lost key clients like McDonald's. Financial growth was anemic. Sadoun embarked on a plan to turn Publicis from a communications partner to a company that could help clients transform their businesses. He sought to break down silos between Publicis' various agencies and help them retool around a bet on "personalization at scale," advanced by the biggest acquisition in its history: the 2019 purchase of the data marketing firm Epsilon for $4.4 billion. "The financial market did not like that," Sadoun said. Neither did many of Publicis' own employees, particularly the Don Draper-esque creatives who were maddened that an outsize focus on data and programmatic ads meant the Parisian company would lose its je ne sais quoi. Competitors mocked Publicis' multimillion-dollar investment in creating an AI platform. Sadoun and Publicis are having the last laugh. At about $27 billion, Publicis' market capitalization is the largest of any individual advertising-agency holding company. It's forecast to end the year with the largest annual revenue, too, with the combination of its data and media offerings representing about half of its sales. While 2024 was a cause for celebration, it faces challenges ahead: This month, its rival Omnicom announced a deal to acquire Interpublic Group that would create the largest ad-agency network. Sadoun described Publicis' award-winning campaign for the French telco Orange as a good outward representation of its modernized offering to marketers. The commercial begins with stars from the French men's national football team flaunting their skills. The reveal — using VFX and deepfake technology — is that the stars of the ad were in fact from Les Bleues, the women's national team. Sadoun credits his leadership team and employees for Publicis' turnaround. He has a more personal hope for his own legacy. In 2022, Sadoun had an operation to remove a tumor in his neck that turned out to be cancerous. Unusually for the CEO of a public company, he disclosed his diagnosis before he underwent treatment: grueling rounds of chemo and radiotherapy that would affect the jet-setting executive's ability to travel. He was flooded with messages revealing that many people were hiding their chronic illnesses from their employers and colleagues. The following year, Sadoun helped launch the Working with Cancer Pledge, which encourages companies to commit to offering more recovery-focused working environments. More than 600 companies have signed up, and the initiative was promoted with a splashy Super Bowl ad bought and created by Publicis last year. "My one mission in life now, apart from my family, is to erase the stigma of cancer in the workplace," Sadoun said. 2024 was a transformative year for the WNBA. It said that attendance increased by nearly 50% year over year and that ratings on ESPN were up by 170% from last season, fueled in part by its rookie stars like Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese. Sponsorship deals have boomed, bringing in advertisers newer to the sports world like Bumble and Skims. Presiding over its astronomical growth is Engelbert, a former Deloitte CEO who became the league's commissioner in 2019. The league has been planting the seeds of its growth for a while. It gained attention by playing during the pandemic in a bubble. It raised $75 million from investors, allowing it to invest in marketing and fan engagement. And it landed sponsorships on its own, separate from the NBA. External factors like the rise of "name, image, and likeness" deals and social media also helped draw attention to the sport. "The thing that was overlooked is that Rome wasn't built in a day," Engelbert told BI. "We didn't do this overnight." One emphasis was on improving the fan experience by meeting spectators where they were, such as updating the app to look more like TikTok, Engelbert said. The WBNA is a big brand now, and with its growth has come scrutiny. Engelbert took heat when she didn't directly condemn threatening comments on social media toward players but likened the situation to a rivalry between male players in the 1970s. She later apologized, promising to do better. "We've been debriefing around a lot of things that happened this year," Engelbert told BI, adding that the league was looking at beefing up security and mental-health resources. "The vitriol our players, me, we all get, we're going to try to tackle that multidimensionally." Engelbert also wants to talk about the flip side. "There's a huge negative to all the vitriol, but there's also people caring about the league like they haven't before," she said. "Apathy's the death of a brand, and there's no more apathy." The WNBA, which is majority-owned by the NBA, remains unprofitable; several outlets described sources as saying it was on track to lose $40 million or more this season. The WNBA declined to comment. Increased sponsorship and media rights will be crucial to keeping up the W's momentum and getting in the black. In a big start, the women's league recently struck an 11-year, $200 million media-rights deal, up from its current deal of $60 million a year. Engelbert also has her sights set on global expansion, starting with the WNBA getting its first Canadian franchise next year. Corporate sponsorships are catching up to the rise of women's sports. Engelbert is ready to capitalize, with stats to appeal to the bottom line. "There's a little scratching and clawing to make sure the old view of the WNBA is not the current view," she said. "Our fans are actually likely to buy from you. So we say this is a good business decision for you." Almost 20 years ago, while she taught at Princeton, Li, known as the "godmother of AI," tested the hypothesis that everything humans could see could be categorized and labeled. This idea built off her graduate research focused on object recognition. Li harnessed the power of crowdsourcing to pioneer ImageNet, a database of 15 million images that became the foundation of computer-vision and deep-learning research. Li has continued advancing this research. This year, she and the leading AI researchers Justin Johnson, Christoph Lassner, and Ben Mildenhall launched World Labs, a startup that aims to take AI beyond large language models. It's valued at $1 billion. With $230 million in funding from investors like Andreessen Horowitz, AMD Ventures, and Nvidia's NVentures, World Labs is seeking to explore AI applications in the two-dimensional plane of pixels and in 3D worlds with spatial intelligence. In December, World Labs dropped its first AI project: a tool designed to turn any image into a 3D model. Since her initial research breakthroughs, Li has testified before Congress about applying responsible ethics to AI and has advocated the inclusion of more women and people of color in the field. "Language is important but, as humans, much of our ability to understand and interact with the world is based on what we see," Li wrote in an op-ed article in The Economist in November. She believes spatial intelligence — which can help with developing robots that look after older adults, or extra hands for a surgeon — is what truly human-centered AI will look like. She's now a codirector of Stanford University's Institute for Human-Centered AI and serves as the Sequoia Capital professor of computer science at Stanford. Li has also worked as a vice president and chief scientist of AI and machine learning at Google Cloud. Huang is becoming the stuff of legend. He has a reputation as a genius, a visionary, and a workaholic. Bosses everywhere want to know his every theory of management to replicate even a fraction of his success. That's because Nvidia has gone from a niche tech firm to one of the most valuable companies in the world in a little more than two years. After decades of toiling out of the limelight, providing the video-gaming industry with graphics chips to render complex, ever-changing imagery but not gaining much name recognition beyond it, Nvidia burst into broader consciousness in 2022, after ChatGPT came to the market. Word quickly spread that the company had for years been buying thousands of Nvidia graphics processing units — it turned out that the kind of computing they're best at is similar to the demands of artificial intelligence. Huang actually donated OpenAI's first eight GPUs, delivering them himself. But Huang anticipated the connection between his chips and AI long before then — he just didn't know how it would materialize. Huang, 61, was born in southwestern Taiwan. He studied electrical engineering at the University of Oregon and Stanford. He had a few jobs in the semiconductor industry, including at Nvidia's major competitor AMD, until he founded Nvidia at 30 with Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem. Despite the recent spotlight on him now, Huang has staying power. He's one the longest-serving tech CEOs, with more than 30 years at the helm. In a recently published memoir, Morris Chang, the founder of Nvidia's most important supplier, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, described offering Huang the CEO job at TSMC. Even now that Nvidia has a market capitalization of more than $3 trillion, Huang sees his work as far from finished. "I watched Jensen make these kinds of bets that are far-reaching, where there's a lot of ambiguity as to when it's going to happen or not," Rev Lebaredian, a vice president of omniverse and simulation technology at Nvidia, told Business Insider this year. Huang is usually right. The journey to enter 2025 with hundreds of foundation models chasing ChatGPT started for Nvidia in about 2006. The next big journey may be self-driving cars and robots, or something else entirely. Some investors still worry that when it comes to Nvidia, what goes up must come down. But investors also believe that if anyone can see or make the future, it's Huang. Sinclair, who grew up in the market town of Rugby in the middle of England, didn't picture a career in finance. "We never really spoke about money around the dinner table or anything like that because there was never any of it," the 42-year-old told Business Insider in an interview. Now Sinclair is helping demystify private markets and powering its growth through data. With civil service in mind, he studied political science at Loughborough University and joined England's Department of Health shortly after graduating in 2004. But Sinclair, a competitive basketball and track athlete, quickly tired of the bureaucracy and craved a faster-paced work culture. After six months, he left for a research-analyst position at Intercontinental Exchange, the operator of major stock exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange and clearinghouses. The finance novice was eager to catch up and learn as much as he could about debt products and subprime markets. He left in 2010 for the data provider Markit, well before the firm merged with IHS and was acquired by S&P Global. Throughout his two-decade career he has maintained a sense of intellectual curiosity, describing himself as one of the most avid readers of industry news among his peers. Drawn to the complexity of private markets, he pivoted away from credit to build IHS Markit's private-equity and debt division. In 2023, he joined the private-markets-data powerhouse Preqin. "You see some of the most innovative companies in the world, and you work with some of the most innovative funds in the world who are deploying capital into just really interesting spaces," he said. Sinclair oversees how Preqin addresses the needs of fund managers, investment banks, and placement agents, representing some 3,000 front-office teams, trying to navigate the opaque industry of private markets. Preqin says the asset class has more than doubled to $16.8 trillion in assets under management over the past five years. Preqin's data can be used, for instance, to target limited partners for fundraising or create customized benchmarks to better convey performance to investors. Private markets are becoming more transparent as providers like Preqin find ways to combine publicly available and proprietary data, Sinclair said. In June, his division launched a data tool to analyze deals across 6,500 funds. This aggregated data can be used to back up valuations in negotiations or identify which financial factors, such as revenue growth or debt pay-down, contributed the most value to a successful deal. The firm's insights are set to become more widely available, as BlackRock is set to acquire Preqin for $3.2 billion. Sinclair said it's easier for individual investors to participate in private markets than ever before, pointing to the growth of data products and favorable regulatory developments. But he added that having options isn't the same as understanding them. "There's a massive amount of education to do. Alternatives have a totally different vocabulary, a different way of thinking about performance, a different way of thinking about risks to the types of products," he said. "I think there's also an obligation of the industry to build the right analytical tools, the right educational tools, datasets to bring the mass affluent along on that journey." The electric-vehicle market has experienced tremendous upheaval in the past year, and car companies are scrambling to understand today's EV buyers. At Ford, Gjaja, the chief operating officer of the Model e electric division, is tasked with navigating the money-losing division through huge changes in demand and customer profiles. After years of growth in the EV segment driven by wealthy early adopters, car companies face the challenge of selling these expensive and complex vehicles to more-regular customers. Ford split its gas and electric divisions in 2022 in a bid to speed up EV development. The company's EV strategy has changed a few times since then, but Ford still breaks out its financial performance: So far in 2024, the Model e division has lost $3.6 billion. In his operations role, Gjaja is trying to reverse those losses by working with Ford's dealers to improve customer experiences and perceptions. Before joining Ford in 2022, Gjaja was a senior partner at Boston Consulting Group, where he worked with clients in retail, technology, and automotive, among other industries. He's putting those years of consulting experience to work as Ford tries to bridge the gap between the wealthy early adopters behind the initial success of vehicles like the Mustang Mach-E and the F-150 Lighting and the more-practical customers who more often leave the lot with a hybrid. While higher prices have turned off some of these new EV shoppers, Gjaja said at an automotive conference in September that this cohort was considering a lot more than sticker price — including their distance from the nearest charger, the cost of charging, battery life, and resale values. Gjaja argued that simply discounting electric cars wouldn't be enough to convince shoppers and certainly wouldn't solve Ford's profitability problem in its Model e division. Instead of focusing on "functional economics," Gjaja said, he examines the "behavioral economics" of EV adoption. He said the journey from what he called an EV denier to a long-term convert could take up to three years. "My job is to figure out how to sell and market a vehicle that people don't appreciate its value until they own it for three years," Gjaja said. Amazon is a retail and cloud powerhouse, and thanks to Hopkins, it's become a media powerhouse, too. Under Hopkins, Amazon now offers not just a wide variety of TV and films but some of the biggest sports franchises like the NFL and the NBA, and even news. Amazon spent $18.9 billion on video and music in 2023, up by 14% from 2022. According to the data firm Ampere Analysis, sports is a growing part of Amazon's entertainment outlay, accounting for 14.3% in 2024, up from virtually nothing five years ago. Amazon's entertainment offerings help keep people subscribing to Prime, the free-delivery service that includes Prime Video and other benefits. But it's also becoming a moneymaker in its own right. In January, Amazon shook up the streaming-ads market when it turned on ads in Prime Video, driving down ad prices for competitors like Netflix while giving Amazon a big shot at the $28.8 billion pie that EMARKETER has forecast will be spent on streaming-TV ads this year. Morgan Stanley has estimated the move could bring in $3.3 billion in revenue this year, on top of Amazon's existing ad business, worth $47 billion in 2023. And with NFL and other streaming rights, Amazon is muscling in on traditional TV networks' turf and training viewers that it's the place to go for live sports. It's even dipped a toe in news, the last stronghold of traditional TV, with a Brian Williams-hosted election-night special. Hopkins' hire in 2020, along with the NBC entertainment vet Jennifer Salke's two years earlier, was a big signal that Amazon was serious about establishing itself as a key player in entertainment. Hopkins is a product of legacy and digital entertainment, having been the chairman of Sony Pictures Television and the CEO of Hulu. At Amazon, he oversaw the $8.5 billion acquisition of the film studio MGM and pushed the company's entertainment studio to expand into broader fare. Prime Video also makes money by fulfilling its promise of being a one-stop shop for viewers by selling subscriptions to other companies' apps like Max, Starz, and, in its most recent flex, Apple TV+. "What we're trying to build is a next-generation entertainment service," Hopkins recently told Bloomberg. Prime Video captured just 3.7% of TV viewing in November, well behind Netflix (7.7%) and YouTube (10.8%), per Nielsen. Despite some wins, like the popular show "The Boys" and the buzzy film "Saltburn," it has a way to go in becoming a consistent hit factory. Still, since most people don't pay for Prime Video as a stand-alone service, it doesn't have the churn problem that dogs other streamers. As part of Amazon, Prime Video is also insulated from some of the financial pressures affecting other entertainment companies. Hopkins is still bringing financial discipline to bear, however. Amazon cut hundreds of jobs across Prime Video and MGM Studios teams early in 2024. Hopkins recently told Bloomberg that the advertising ramp-up was a factor in pursuing NBA rights and that he expected Prime Video to be profitable "very soon." Since 2021, Varkey has been the president of the Mayo Clinic Health System, a network of 16 community hospitals and 45 multispecialty clinics across more than three dozen communities in Minnesota and Wisconsin. The facilities serve rural areas where care can otherwise be difficult to access. Varkey, who comes from a family of physicians, said her work focused on reaching patients without ready access to the sprawling Mayo Clinic campus in Rochester, Minnesota, and its world-renowned medical expertise. Varkey told Business Insider that part of her focus was finding new ways to incorporate technology so that more people can obtain care and administrative burdens can be reduced. That includes using artificial intelligence to help with diagnosing conditions and using technology so that clinicians can manage complex chronic conditions virtually. The efforts also include introducing a mobile clinic that can go where routine and preventive care is needed and even provide wireless internet access so patients can confer with specialists. The clinic, which travels across southern Minnesota, offers virtual or in-person appointments. It has two exam rooms and a laboratory. "So now you have preventive exams, specialist visits that are occurring in very remote areas," she said. Varkey said Mayo Clinic Health System was also trying to bring medical expertise to rural residents through programs that connect small local clinics with specialists from hub sites or from Mayo's Rochester campus. Small clinics, she said, might have only a single nurse practitioner — nothing like the variety of disciplines a larger facility would have. "It's been very exciting to watch, and patients have really appreciated it as well," Varkey said. Another effort to meet patients where they are is the organization's hospital-at-home program. Varkey said remote monitoring technology helped these patients remain with family and be more comfortable than they'd be in a medical facility. "You get the same Mayo care," she said, adding that the approach had been popular with patients. Varkey, who also holds an MBA from the University of Minnesota, returned to Mayo in 2021 after serving as the president and CEO of Yale New Haven Health Northeast Medical Group. From 2001 to 2013, Varkey held leadership positions at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, including associate chair of the Department of Medicine, medical director of Ask Mayo Clinic, and program director of the Preventive Medicine Fellowship. Varkey said the expanding capabilities of AI and discoveries in genomics and molecular medicine were "taking healthcare to the next level — and very fast." While those developments are exciting, Varkey said, they shouldn't distract from the primary goal of patient-centered care. Kapila likes to stay ahead of the game. During the first 10 years of his career, the computer-science graduate completed four certifications each year while working as a tech consultant for firms like Nasdaq and Sallie Mae. While working at the hedge fund Citadel in the mid-2000s, he took MBA classes at night at Northwestern University. "Everything in this field changes so quickly," he said. "Things change in finance and things change in tech at an ever increasing pace." Now Kapila is a copresident and chief operating officer of Parametric, a pioneer of direct indexing with $570 billion in assets under management. He joined Parametric in 2019 after rising up the ranks at BlackRock, overseeing portfolio construction management for its widely used Aladdin platform. Kapila moved to a much smaller firm to have a bigger impact. "It was an opportunity to kind of look at what Parametric has done well, think about how to build on the success, but then also take advantage of what's happening in the technology space and rethink how Parametric could operate, let's say, five years from that point," he said. His move was well timed. There has been a boom in direct indexing, a tax-savvy investing strategy of buying individual securities modeled off an index like the S&P 500. Two years after Kapila joined Parametric, Morgan Stanley acquired Parametric's parent company, Eaton Vance. Thanks to a wave of similar acquisitions, Parametric faces well-capitalized competitors such as BlackRock's Aperio and Franklin Templeton's Canvas. Industry stalwarts like Fidelity and upstarts like Envestnet also want a piece of the action. Kapila said Parametric, founded in 1987, has experience and scale on its side. "I will say that given the technology trends, sometimes it's easy to come in and have a solution. It's much, much harder to have a scalable solution that will serve clients when the demand spikes," he said. "We're managing over 200,000 accounts for our clients. The level of scale, I think, often is a breaking point for some of the newer entrants." To stay ahead of the competition, Kapila is pushing Parametric to develop more automated products, such as Radius, which launched this year. Radius constructs fixed-income and equity portfolios and runs simulations to identify the best selections for portfolio managers. Kapila described it as a "turning point" for Parametric. "This is the first time we've had a product that's really end-to-end running in that automated platform manner with a person reviewing and approving and intervening as necessary," he said. He plans to launch more cloud-native tools, which are easier to scale and manage, for other asset classes in 2025 and 2026. Parametric is also bringing its tax-savvy strategies to active management, launching Custom Active this summer. Rather than modeling portfolios off indexes, clients can pick equities off strategies from its asset-management partner Lazard or sports-league sponsors. "Those are examples where we can provide a tax overlay and help people get the advantages of direct indexing while managing to an active model," Kapila said. "There's a demand for that, and it's early days," he added, "but I think that's really what's playing out."
