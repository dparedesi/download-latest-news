Title: Elon Musk's xAI raises $6 billion in fresh funding: 'We are gonna need a bigger compute!'

Elon Musk's xAI has completed its Series C funding round, raising a total of $6 billion, it revealed in a Monday blog post. Musk's artificial intelligence company said the participants included a16z, Sequoia Capital, Morgan Stanley, BlackRock, Fidelity, Saudi Arabia's Kingdom Holdings, Oman and Qatar's sovereign wealth funds, California-based Lightspeed Venture Partners, Chicago-based Valor Equity Partners, Dubai-based Vy Capital, and UAE-based tech investor MGX. xAI added that chipmakers Nvidia and AMD took part as strategic investors and "continue to support xAI in rapidly scaling our infrastructure." Musk shared the news on his X platform, writing, "A lot of compute is needed." He also tagged xAI in a meme generated by xAI's Grok chatbot that riffed on a famous line from the movie "Jaws." “We are gonna need a bigger compute!”@xAI https://t.co/ckc78vJhL6 Musk was likely underscoring the vast amount of processing power needed to train and run AI models, which has fueled enormous demand for microchips and underpinned a roughly eightfold rise in Nvidia stock since the start of 2023. xAI, founded in March last year, raised $6 billion at a post-money valuation of $24 billion in its Series B round in May. The Wall Street Journal reported in late November that it had raised a further $5 billion at a $50 billion valuation. It appears xAI ultimately raised a bigger round of $6 billion, but the valuation wasn't disclosed. The startup highlighted its progress since May in its blog post, including its launch of Colossus — the world's largest AI supercomputer powered by 100,000 Nvidia Hopper GPUs, which xAI plans to double in size to 200,000 chips soon. xAI also released version two of Grok, an application programming interface (API) for developers to build on its platform, its Aurora image generation model for Grok, and Grok on X. The company said it's training Grok 3 and "focused on launching innovative new consumer and enterprise products that will leverage the power of Grok, Colossus, and X to transform the way we live, work, and play." Musk's fledgling business said it would use the Series C funds to accelerate its infrastructure growth, ship new products, and speed up its research and development of tech that will enable its "mission to understand the true nature of the universe."

Title: House Judiciary Committee sends letters to investment firms tied to ‘woke ESG cartel’

Skip to comments. Posted on 12/24/2024 2:23:00 AM PST by Libloather The Republican-led House Judiciary Committee took aim at a group of US asset managers over their involvement with a “woke ESG cartel” — adding pressure against environmental efforts by large investors. The committee, chaired by Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, sent letters to 60 firms — including BlackRock, State Street and JPMorgan Asset Management — that are members of the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative, or NZAM, an international group of investors that signed on to a pledge to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. The letters, sent Friday, made claims in line with a committee report released on Dec. 13 that Republicans say showed fund firms colluded to cut emissions. That report found that top asset managers in the US were concerned that signing up for an industry climate initiative would make them look like they worked too closely together and attract regulatory scrutiny. The committee’s Democrats have dismissed such claims, and big fund firms have denied similar charges. Jordan alleges in the letter that that companies’ efforts with NZAM and the affiliated Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero “may violate U.S. antitrust law,” citing the earlier report. It asks for information such as how companies’ participation in NZAM changed their stewardship strategies. GOP Judiciary Committee members claim that investor preoccupation with environmental, social and governance (ESG) strategies takes the focus away from delivering profits for shareholders and imposes unnecessary restrictions on business. Republicans previously have taken credit for prompting three fund managers — BlackRock, State Street and JPMorgan Asset Management — to step back from another investor group, the Climate Action 100+.

ChatGPT said: ChatGPT Vanguard is unique in that it is owned by its shareholders, meaning the investors in its funds. Unlike traditional for-profit investment firms, Vanguard operates as a mutual company, where the company itself is owned by the funds it manages, and those funds are in turn owned by the investors in those funds. This structure allows Vanguard to focus on benefiting its investors, as the profits from the company are used to reduce costs for fund shareholders rather than being paid out to external shareholders or owners. This model is one of the key factors behind Vanguard’s reputation for low-cost investing. window.__oai_logHTML?window.__oai_logHTML():window.__oai_SSR_HTML=window.__oai_SSR_HTML||Date.now();requestAnimationFrame((function(){window.__oai_logTTI?window.__oai_logTTI():window.__oai_SSR_TTI=window.__oai_SSR_TTI||Date.now()})) ChatGPT can make mistakes.

Title: Jim Cramer on Reddit (RDDT): ‘I Don’t Know What To Do About It’

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Jim Cramer’s Latest Calls Before 2025 Begins: Top 10 Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Reddit Inc (NYSE:RDDT) stands against other stocks in Jim Cramer’s latest calls before 2025 begins. Jim Cramer in a latest program talked about the market reaction to the Federal Reserve’s latest rate cut and its guidance that suggested fewer rate cuts moving ahead. “I guess you could say the baby got thrown out with the bathwater. It was truly hideous, a little unexpected, and yes, wicked. Even though the market’s barely oversold, we may not get that quick snapback we normally expect in a deeply oversold market,” Cramer said. Jim Cramer said Jerome Powell’s comments and tone were “stern” and his conference call “confounded” investors. Cramer said inflation has not come down enough and that has made the Fed’s job difficult. Cramer then talked about different sectors and companies that need rate cuts amid a slowdown. “I really wish the Fed hadn’t been so defensive about the need to cut rates going forward. A slower approach would have been much better. If they had explicitly taken a wait-and-see approach before this meeting, we’d be in a better position. This time, they telegraphed the wrong thing, hence today’s meltdown. However, if the weaker part of the economy deteriorates further or inflation comes down, the Fed still has room to cut. Here’s the bottom line: a previously data-dependent Fed chose not to be data-dependent today with its pronouncements, and that’s what drove the market down. This happened despite the quarter-point rate cut—something that’s typically good news for stocks—but it turned out to be the very opposite.” READ ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In For this article, we watched some latest programs of Jim Cramer and picked 11 stocks he is talking about. With each company, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 52 Jim Cramer has been bullish on Reddit Inc (NYSE:RDDT) but the stock’s bull run has him recommending investors to wait for a pullback. In a latest program, Cramer said: “I like Reddit, but you know what? Reddit now has a parabolic chart, and I don’t know what to do about it. It’s just going bonkers, and I wish it had a pullback before I could recommend it. It’s an extraordinary chart, but it has just moved up too much.” With over 80 million daily active users, Reddit Inc (NYSE:RDDT) remains one of the fastest-growing social media platforms in the world. While Facebook and Twitter show signs of maturing growth, Reddit Inc (NYSE:RDDT) still has huge upside potential as more and more people flock to Reddit discussion boards for authentic opinions and discussion. User input from millions of people on various topics freely accessible to anyone is Reddit Inc (NYSE:RDDT)’s moat. As of 2023, users posted 16 billion comments on the platform, according to the company. That’s why companies are flocking to pay money to Reddit to use its data to train their AI models. Reddit Inc (NYSE:RDDT) has a licensing agreement with Alphabet Inc.’s Google worth $60 million to help train large language models.

Overall, RDDT ranks 6th on our list of Jim Cramer’s latest calls before 2025 begins.

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 43 Jim Cramer in a latest program analyzed why Wall Street missed the Palantir Technologies Inc (NASDAQ:PLTR) rally and how the company defies conventional valuation models. “It has a tremendous business model that could change the entire Defense Department budget, but in some ways, Palantir is a renegade company playing by its own rules. Like AMC, the theater chain, the CEO actually caters not to Wall Street but to Main Street individual investors. What makes Palantir Technologies Inc (NYSE:PLTR) one of the top AI stocks? Its technologies are actually solving the problems of businesses. Palantir’s data technology Ontology is solving the famous hallucination problem for AI systems, thanks to the company’s years of experience with military and defense systems. Earlier this year at an event with customers, Palantir Technologies Inc (NYSE:PLTR) shared some specifics on how its customers are being able to reduce costs and increase profits due to its artificial intelligence platform (AIP) that was launched about a year ago. Airbus accelerated A350 production by 33%, BP reduced costs per barrel by 60%, and Jacobs Connect cut power usage by 30%. Panasonic decreased waste by 12%, ESI Group sped up ERP harmonization by 70%, and PG&E reduced transformer ignitions by 65%. Eaton boosted productivity by 25%, while Tyson Foods achieved $200 million in cost savings. Fidelity Growth Strategies Fund stated the following regarding Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “Untimely ownership of Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) (+47%) also hurt the fund’s relative result. This software and services firm, which operates in both government and commercial segments, saw strong growth during the quarter, largely driven by its “AIP” – or Artificial Intelligence Platform – offering. In early August, the company reported Q2 financial results that mostly met somewhat lofty expectations. We established a sizable holding in Palantir Technologies during the quarter, and at quarter end it was the second-largest position and a slight overweight.” Overall, PLTR ranks 8th on our list of Jim Cramer’s latest calls before 2025 begins. While we acknowledge the potential of PLTR, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Jim Cramer’s Latest Calls Before 2025 Begins: Top 10 Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Ford Motor Co (NYSE:F) stands against other stocks in Jim Cramer’s latest calls before 2025 begins. Jim Cramer in a latest program talked about the market reaction to the Federal Reserve’s latest rate cut and its guidance that suggested fewer rate cuts moving ahead. “I guess you could say the baby got thrown out with the bathwater. It was truly hideous, a little unexpected, and yes, wicked. Even though the market’s barely oversold, we may not get that quick snapback we normally expect in a deeply oversold market,” Cramer said. Jim Cramer said Jerome Powell’s comments and tone were “stern” and his conference call “confounded” investors. Cramer said inflation has not come down enough and that has made the Fed’s job difficult. Cramer then talked about different sectors and companies that need rate cuts amid a slowdown. “I really wish the Fed hadn’t been so defensive about the need to cut rates going forward. A slower approach would have been much better. If they had explicitly taken a wait-and-see approach before this meeting, we’d be in a better position. This time, they telegraphed the wrong thing, hence today’s meltdown. However, if the weaker part of the economy deteriorates further or inflation comes down, the Fed still has room to cut. Here’s the bottom line: a previously data-dependent Fed chose not to be data-dependent today with its pronouncements, and that’s what drove the market down. This happened despite the quarter-point rate cut—something that’s typically good news for stocks—but it turned out to be the very opposite.” READ ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In For this article, we watched some latest programs of Jim Cramer and picked 11 stocks he is talking about. With each company, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A Ford truck roaring down a highway, with powerful headlights blazing its way. Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 36 Jim Cramer in a latest program on CNBC expressed his concerns over rising warranty costs of Ford Motor Co (NYSE:F) and said the stock does not have a lot of “MOJO.” “Ford does not have a lot of mojo in this note by Jefferies. This is one of the reasons—what can save the Fed when they cut. Ford has an inventory drifting up to 96 days. That says to me price cut, way too much, way too much. And by the way, that’s far more than GM—26. Wow. I mean, GM and Stellantis have much lower inventories.” Ford shares have gained about 10% over the past 10 years, a stark contrast to the S&P 500’s 250%. Legacy automakers like Ford are grappling with challenges from newer competitors, the shift to electric vehicles (EVs), and the rapid rise of autonomous technology. Ford’s Model e segment continues to drain cash as Ford works to strengthen its EV business. While the company has some strong products, it faces stiff competition from Tesla, Inc. (TSLA), Rivian Automotive, Inc. (RIVN), and other EV makers, leading to significant losses. Year-to-date, Ford’s EBIT has dropped to $8.1 billion, down from $9.4 billion in the same period last year. Ford’s struggle to reduce warranty costs remains a concern. The company issued 62 recalls in 2024, far surpassing General Motors Company (GM), which had 33. Since 2021, Ford has had the industry’s highest recall rate, reflecting poorly on management’s efforts to lower warranty expenses and damaging the brand’s reputation. Overall, F ranks 10th on our list of Jim Cramer’s latest calls before 2025 begins. While we acknowledge the potential of F, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than F but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: People With Extreme Wealth Should Give It Away—or Be Penalized

If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission. This helps support our journalism. Learn more. Please also consider subscribing to WIRED In 2024, wealth concentration rose to an all-time high. According to Forbes’ Billionaires List, not only are there more billionaires than ever—2,781—but those billionaires are also richer than ever, with an aggregate worth of $14.2 trillion. This is a trend that looks set to continue unabated. A recent report from the financial data company Altrata estimated that about 1.2 million individuals who are worth more than $5 million will pass on a collective wealth of almost $31 trillion over the next decade. Discontentment and concern over the consequences of extreme wealth in our society is growing. Senator Bernie Sanders, for instance, stated that the “obscene level of income and wealth inequality in America is a profoundly moral issue.” In a joint op-ed for CNN in 2023, Democratic congresswoman Barbara Lee and Disney heiress Abigail Disney wrote that “extreme wealth inequality is a threat to our economy and democracy.” In 2024, when the board of Tesla put to vote a $56 billion pay package for Elon Musk, some major shareholders voted against it, declaring that such a compensation level was “absurd” and “ridiculous.” In 2025, the fight against rising wealth inequality will be high on the political agenda. In July 2024, the G20—the world’s 20 biggest economies—agreed to work on a proposal by Brazil to introduce a new global “billionaire tax” that would levy a 2 percent tax on assets worth more than $1 billion. This would raise an estimated $250 billion a year. While this specific proposal was not endorsed in the Rio declaration, the G20 countries agreed that the super rich should be taxed more. Progressive politicians won’t be the only ones trying to address this problem. In 2025, millionaires themselves will increasingly mobilize and put pressure on political leaders. One such movement is Patriotic Millionaires, a nonpartisan group of multimillionaires who are already publicly campaigning and privately lobbying the American Congress for a guaranteed living wage for all, a fair tax system, and the protection of equal representation. “Millionaires and large corporations—who have benefited most from our country’s assets—should pay a larger percentage of the tab for running the country,” reads their value statement. Members include Abigail Disney, former BlackRock executive Morris Pearl, legal scholar Lawrence Lessig, screenwriter Norman Lear, and investor Lawrence Benenson. This story is from the WIRED World in 2025, our annual trends briefing. Another example is TaxMeNow, a lobby group founded in 2021 by young multimillionaires in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland which also advocates for higher wealth taxation. Its most famous member is the 32-year old Marlene Engelhorn, descendant of Friedrich Engelhorn, founder of German pharma giant BASF. She recently set up a council made up of 50 randomly selected Austrian citizens to decide what should happen to her €25 million inheritance. “I have inherited a fortune, and therefore power, without having done anything for it,” she said in a statement. “If politicians don’t do their job and redistribute, then I have to redistribute my wealth myself.” Earlier this year, Patriotic Millionaires, TaxMeNow, Oxfam, and another activist group called Millionaires For Humanity formed a coalition called Proud to Pay More, and addressed a letter to global leaders during the annual gathering of the World Economic Forum in Davos. Signed by hundreds of high-net-worth individuals—including heiress Valerie Rockefeller, actor Simon Pegg, and filmmaker Richard Curtis—the letter stated: “We all know that ‘trickle down economics’ has not translated into reality. Instead it has given us stagnating wages, crumbling infrastructure, failing public services, and destabilized the very institution of democracy.” It concluded: “We ask you to take this necessary and inevitable step before it’s too late. Make your countries proud. Tax extreme wealth.” In 2025, thanks to the nascent movement of activist millionaires, these calls will grow even louder.

After failing to convince OpenAI executives of his plans, Elon Musk started his own AI startup, xAI. Over the past several months, xAI has aggressively pursued funding to support its rapid growth and ambitious goals in the competitive AI landscape. In May, xAI announced its Series B funding round of $6 billion. Last night, xAI announced that it had closed its Series C funding round of $6 billion. Popular VC firms including A16Z, Blackrock, Fidelity, Kingdom Holdings, Lightspeed, MGX, Morgan Stanley, OIA, QIA, Sequoia Capital, Valor Equity Partners, and Vy Capital participated in this funding round. xAI also announced that NVIDIA and AMD participated in the round as strategic investors that will help them rapidly scale their AI infrastructure. As expected, xAI will use the funds to further improve its computing infrastructure, develop products, and accelerate the research and development of future technologies. xAI is also hiring aggressively to pursue its mission. Since its Series B announcement in May of this year, xAI has made the following progress: With this substantial investment, xAI is well-positioned to compete with other major players including OpenAI, Google and Meta in the AI landscape. It will be interesting to see how they utilize these funds to innovate and advance their technology in the coming months.

Title: Jim Cramer on Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc. (LW): ‘Look, This Company Was Doing Better Than Its Spin-off Would Have Been’

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Talked About These 17 Stocks After The Fed's Rate Cut. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:LW) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about. The Federal Reserve created quite a bit of turmoil in the stock market on Wednesday when despite cutting interest rates, it signaled to investors that the journey to low rates was far from over and would take longer than initially expected. Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted that "We have been moving sideways on 12-month inflation," and used the data observation to project two rate cuts in 2025 instead of the earlier four. In Squawk on the Street's episode the day after the Fed's rate cut, Cramer called the latest Fed outcome"a new phase in the process." He outlined that the Fed might have missed the mark in being data-dependent. According to him "Look I think that they are data dependent. But they made a prediction and the prediction was not right. They should have just stayed data-dependent. They could've looked at the long bond and realized, you know wait a second, we're on the wrong track here. And signal that. And they didn't signal it." Cramer was pressed about what Chair Powell got wrong, and in response, he shared that it was "The messaging. Right, because what happened is this that . . .we have a data-dependent Fed, and they chose not to be data-dependant." Cramer added that the apparent miss from being data-dependant meant that the Fed's "message was off. They're not wrong, but all the people who thought that they were gonna be kind and dovish, I mean they were, uh, black dovish." The morning show host also shared his thoughts about the current tussle in Congress related to spending bills and electric vehicle billionaire Elon Musk's role in it. "Look they got a real guy, Musk. Do you want to mess with Musk? I'm not messing with Musk. I tried it once. I was pantsed. You don't want to be pantsed by this man," said Cramer. He added "But I do want to make a point that there are a lot of people who are hopeful that he can do something about that. The $36 trillion that we have." According to Cramer, to achieve the cut maybe Musk and his team "shame people, maybe he shames people who are giveaway guys," as he believes that "he [MUSK] represents this chain of thought in this country that there's hope. That this government can get its act together." Cramer's remarks in the morning show weren't the only ones covering the rate cut. Immediately after the cut, in Mad Money, he commented on Chair Powell "Because he seemed to get caught having to fulfill a prediction of the need for a rate cut, and that need was no longer self-evident. The data didn't back it up. It would have been much better off if they had explicitly taken a wait-and-see approach before this meeting. This time they telegraphed the wrong thing. Hence today's meltdown." Building on the comments, the next day he outlined "There were some very cogent questions at the press conference about whether, when you study it, after his statement, did they really need a cut? By their own admission? And, I think it confused people. It confused people because they cut rates and then gave exactly the, what I would call the [inaudible] for not cutting rates. David, this is that same problem that I keep saying which is that, if they had not set us up, not told certain people in the media, whatever, that we need a cut, and then they kind of like regretted it. And they regretted it because business is so strong, like GDP, inflation is a little bit higher." Cramer concluded by stating that he believes the Fed "got trapped, Jay got trapped." As for China, the CNBC host didn't mince any words either. According to him, China has "done nothing but build up" its military. Cramer does not trust the Chinese either. Quoting from the former Trump Administration's Secretary of Defense General Jim Mattis' book, Cramer shared that where "the Chinese meet with Obama and they agree to everything and it's really terrific and then they, a day later, they violate everything with the South China Sea." Situations like these make him "think that we've been taken advantage of." Our Methodology To make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC's Squawk on the Street aired the day after the Fed's rate cut. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in?

(see more details here). Potatoes being sorted on a conveyor belt in a modern packing facility. Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 37 Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:LW) is a well-known American firm that sells french fries. It is one of the worst-performing stocks on the market in 2024 as the shares are down 42% year-to-date. Like Conagra, the firm has struggled with declining volumes due to consumers struggling with high inflation. However, Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:LW) has also dealt with rising potato prices, which a lawsuit claims stems from due actions of a 'potato cartel.' The firm is also purportedly part of this cartel. US potato production dropped to a new low since 2010 by June 2024 and prices had surged by 36%. Cramer's comments around Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:LW) revolved around management changes forced by activist investor Jana Partners: "What do they think the financial results are? What are the financial results of this man coming in. . . .of this change, the COO coming in [AS CEO]? . . . Disastrous! "Look, this company was doing better than its spin-off would have been, the company was spun off from Conagra. Uh, and I always felt, but hold on, wait a second, maybe Conagra should have kept french fries but in the end this is a company that is now worth $9 billion versus $12 billion when Conagra completely reversed. There was some way to make this company better. And you don't pick the guy who is part of the regime. Overall LW ranks 13th on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about. While we acknowledge the potential of LW as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

(NASDAQ:NUKK)'s announcement to use the proceeds to acquire a majority stake in a firm that supplies components for Israel's Iron Dome system. The firm's financial performance in the first two quarters of 2024 has been nothing short of dismal with 90%+ drops. According to Cramer: "NUKK is up gigantically on a placement. And you know what, NUKK is a punchline. Alright? It's a punchline." Overall NUKK ranks 17th on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about. While we acknowledge the potential of NUKK as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NUKK but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Hit your long-term targets. Earn up to 16% per year on digital assets. Share this article Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence company xAI announced Monday it had raised $6 billion in a Series C funding round, with backing from major investors including BlackRock, Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), Fidelity, Morgan Stanley, and other high-profile investors. Strategic investors NVIDIA and AMD also participated in the round, continuing their support for xAI’s infrastructure scaling efforts. The funding round was exclusive to xAI’s existing investors, many of whom had previously supported Musk’s acquisition of X, according to Financial Times. The latest financing, first revealed through a SEC filing last week, brings xAI’s total funding to $12 billion. It follows a previous $6 billion round completed earlier in 2024. According to CNBC, Musk’s AI business targets a valuation of around $50 billion, which would double its valuation six months ago. The fresh capital will be used to support the research and development of xAI’s generative AI model, Grok, and to expand its infrastructure, the team shared in the announcement. Since its Series B funding in May 2024, xAI has launched several key initiatives, including Colossus, which it describes as “the world’s largest AI supercomputer,” Grok 2, and the xAI API for developers. The company also introduced Aurora, its proprietary image generation model, and integrated Grok with the X platform to provide real-time information processing capabilities. xAI is currently training Grok 3, which it calls its “most powerful model yet.” The company aims for it to be comparable to or even surpass OpenAI’s GPT-5, with a focus on enhancing its capabilities in natural language understanding, image generation, and coding tasks. Musk anticipates that Grok 3 will be launched by the end of this year. Following its release, xAI plans to expand its infrastructure to include 200,000 GPUs, with the potential to scale up to as many as 300,000 GPUs in the future.

Title: Christmas walks: 10 family-friendly trails around Ireland, from easy to challenging

Expensive and demanding, Christmas sells itself by creating expectations of a relaxing time coalescing seamlessly with everyone. In reality, there is pressure to finish work, find the right gifts, remember every relative, and then being cooped with family for days. Yet, few would be without it, for it is also when we step off the treadmill to put family, friends and simpler things before competition and achievement. This is when quietness envelopes the landscape as nature takes a breather at a time when the outdoors are mostly shrouded in moody but atmospheric half-light. It makes it the perfect time to escape the embrace of domesticity and let your seasonal stresses melt away on one of the bracing family walks listed below. The town, which possesses some of Ireland’s finest medieval walls, is undergoing a transformation in recent times with the captivating Fethard Horse Country Experience and the spanking new dining destination at Sadler’s Restaurant and Bar. An innovative sports and recreation campus has also been created that offers 4G and grass pitches along with a gym and cosy cafe. Titled Fethard Town Park, it also boasts a 2km walkway around the perimeter. With an excellent surface for buggies or wheelchairs, this makes a perfect outdoor excursion for even the most inclement December day. Another outing offering a good surface, this walk is entirely within Cork city. This may seem off-putting, but it shouldn’t, for this is a varied outing offering much to fascinate. Starting from the riverside Marina car park, continue through Marina Park and on by Páirc Uí Chaoimh and Holland Park. Join a public road with the slow-flowing river Lee to your left. After a short distance, follow Castle Road left to reach Blackrock Castle, a 16th-century fortification, which is now an observatory. Onward next along a lovely riverside path for about 3km with sublime views across the water. Pass Joe McHugh Park and then cross a causeway. Go right along a sylvan path following the track bed of the old Passage Railway. Cross a footbridge above the South Ring Road and finish along an attractive 3km greenway leading back to Marina Park. Despite the hordes who descend on it year-round, Glendalough still exudes a mysterious and haunting quality that unmistakably denotes it as a special place. For a gentle introduction to this deep and sheltered valley, start from the Visitor Centre car park, by crossing a stream and following a green road past the famous monastery founded by St Kevin. Push past the Lower Lake to Glendalough’s upper car park. Turn right and follow the supremely tranquil waterside before going right again, and continuing along a boardwalk. Follow the north shore of the lower lake and finish on a Green Road leading to your start point, having walked just over 3km in about one hour. Located just off the N77 Kilkenny-to-Ballyragget road, Jenkinstown Estate, is where Thomas Moore penned his most famous poem The Last Rose of Summer. Despite its rather melancholic final verse, it became hugely popular and was soon being performed more often as a song. [ Winter walks: Eight picturesque trails with places to eat and drink at the endOpens in new window ] The great house, where Moore stayed is just a memory, but within the surrounding parklands you can still discover where the bard found inspiration by exploring the atmospheric woodlands that provide shelter on an imperfect day. The Walled Garden Loop (2km) and the slightly longer Jenkinstown Loop (3km) offer the perfect outing for families, with young children or buggies, wishing to wrap up and get out on an easy Christmas stroll. The distinctive landscape of Co Sligo has drawn visitors for generations to its multitude of accessible visitor attractions. But there is something especially rewarding about getting off the obvious tourist trail and capturing a modest hilltop. Located just west of Sligo town, Knocknarea is an eminence that simply drips with history and takes just a half-hour to ascend on an easy path. But the rewards are out of proportion to effort. The summit is adorned by a huge cairn, which is reputedly the burial pace of Connacht’s Queen Maeve and also offers a wonderful 360 view to Donegal Bay, Ben Bulben and the timeless Sligo landscape with Strandhill immediately below. Returning from the summit, you can regale the family with stories of the Táin Bó Cúailnge, when Maeve attempted to steal Ulster’s prize bull, Donn Cúailnge. This gentle 4.5km outing starts from Cadamstown by following the Slieve Bloom Way and blue arrows uphill along an old coach road before swinging to a rustic track known as Paul’s Lane. Onwards past the sombre remnants of the deserted Bordingstown village before parting company with the Slieve Bloom Way at a point offering views towards the deliciously named Wolftrap Mountain. Right and downhill, following the blue arrows and then through a gateway to continue across a Mass path that once conveyed mountain folk to worship. Next, tag a stream known locally as Purcell’s Brook to reach a beguiling little weir. Beyond, a stile leads to a spectacular path traversing the banks of the Silver river. Here the hurrying waters descend over pretty waterfalls and eddies, which can be viewed from the trail. Eventually abandoning the river, the path ascends to a wooden stile accessing farmland before turning left on to a bucolic laneway that ambles downhill to the trailhead. From the Nire Valley car park, which is located about 10km east of Ballymacarbery Village, follow the white poles marking an ancient trade route that once bisected the Comeraghs. Gain a low saddle between Knockanaffrin (Mass Mountain) and the immense Comeragh plateau, which is known locally as the Gap. Here, enchanting views will open up over the great flatlands of Waterford and Kilkenny to the distant outline of the Blackstairs Mountains. If you have enough for today, you can now retrace your steps to the Nire Valley car park after a two-hour outing. If you want to segue to a more challenging outing, swing northwest and ascend the Knockanaffrin Ridge, which rises in undemanding steps like a benign staircase to reach a level section above an attractive tear-shaped tarn known as Coumduala. From here, swing left and descend southwest by following a helpful fence and purple arrows to regain the trailhead after about three hours. [ Markets in Vienna or Christmas at The Shelbourne? 10 holiday escapes over the festive seasonOpens in new window ] If you really want to get the heart rate going, head for the parking place by the Graves of Leinstermen, lying about 6km north from the Tipperary village of Ballina. This unusual conclave of stones reputedly dates from Brian Boru’s kingship of Munster, when he supposedly showed himself the ultimate father-in-law from hell by massacring the King of Leinster’s entourage as they travelled to request Brian’s daughter in matrimony. Myths rearrange facts, however; this site is actually Bronze Age and predates Brian by about 2,000 years. Here, a zigzag path labours steeply up Tountinna (Hill of the Wave) – named after a biblical flood that reputedly drowned Ireland’s first inhabitants. One survivor was Fionntán, who cannily took refuge high on Tountinna. You will reach the ugly communications masts that adorn the summit in a little over a half-hour. Look beyond these, however, and you are compensated with mesmeric views over the opalescent waters of Lough Derg to the shimmering Clare Hills beyond. Return by your route of ascent. A magnificent swirl of naked limestone, Mullaghmore is a jewel even within the Burren’s rich treasury. From Corofin, take the Kilfenora Road, go right at Kilnaboy and right again at a parking place. Start your walk by following arrows from the roadside at Lough Gealáin where fossilised skeletons embedded within the limestone will fascinate younger folk and prove that the Burren originated as an ocean floor aeons ago. As you ascend, point to an isolated house; the kids will instantly recognise this as Father Ted’s bleakly unadorned dwelling from the eponymous soap opera. An enjoyable scramble leads to the summit, where a great panorama unfolds. Mullaghmore could truthfully be described as Ireland’s biggest little mountain; despite its modest stature, it stands shoulder-to-shoulder with the views from loftier eminences such as Carrauntoohil and Errigal. Return to the trailhead by your ascent route after about 2.5 hours. Another mountain that punches above its modest height by offering panromantic views along with rocky summit tors. Begin from the car park on Sandbank Road, lying southeast of Hilltown off the Kilkeel Road. Cross the road and follow the lane for 500m and then go through a gate and tag an informal, grassy track to the left as it rises to a conversation-killing 220m. It’s a short upward flog, however, and soon two tors signal your approach to the summit. Pass left of these and continue straight ahead to gain the Summit Tor. Here, young people will love scrambling (with supervision) to the top, which is renowned for its sublime views, particularly at sunset. Afterwards, descend to the trailhead after an outing of about 1.5 hours. © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Title: BlackRock Municipal Income Fund, Inc. (MUI) Provides De-Listing and Conversion Dates for Upcoming Conversion to Unlisted Continuously-Offered Closed-End Fund

Time Published: 2024-12-24T00:32:04Z
Full Content:
NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--BlackRock Municipal Income Fund, Inc. (NYSE: MUI, the Fund) is providing additional information related to the Fund's upcoming conversion from an exchange-listed closed-end fund to an unlisted continuously-offered closed-end fund that conducts quarterly repurchases of its shares (the Conversion) and will operate under the name BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) Municipal Credit Alpha Portfolio, Inc. (the Interval Fund). It is currently anticipated that the Conversion will take place after the close of business on March 21, 2025, and be effective on March 24, 2025 (the Conversion Date). Delisting From the New York Stock Exchange In connection with the Conversion, the Fund intends to delist its shares of common stock (MUI Shares) from the New York Stock Exchange effective as of the close of business on February 14, 2025 (the Delisting Date). Please note that, effective as of the Delisting Date, the MUI Shares will no longer trade on the NYSE or any other securities exchange. The Conversion Date and the Delisting Date are subject to change. Any such changes will be announced via press release. Conversion and First Periodic Repurchase MUI Shares held on the Conversion Date will be redesignated as Institutional Shares of the Interval Fund (Interval Fund Shares). The Interval Fund Shares will not be listed for trading on any securities exchange and a secondary market is not expected to develop for the Interval Fund Shares. As a result, an investment in the Interval Fund is not a liquid investment. Shareholders will generally only be able to sell their Interval Fund Shares through the Interval Fund's quarterly offers to repurchase between 5% and 25% of the outstanding Interval Fund Shares. The Interval Fund currently intends to commence the initial repurchase offer in the second quarter of 2025. Although the Interval Fund intends to conduct quarterly repurchase offers, such repurchase offers may be oversubscribed. If a repurchase offer is oversubscribed, the Interval Fund will repurchase the shares tendered on a pro rata basis, and shareholders will have to wait until the next repurchase offer to make another repurchase request. As a result, shareholders may be unable to liquidate all or a given percentage of their investment in the Interval Fund through a particular repurchase offer. Shareholders will be subject to the risk of NAV fluctuations and other investment-related risks during that period. Important Notice to Shareholders Who Hold Shares Through a Financial Intermediary Following the Conversion, the Interval Fund will offer one or more classes of shares through select financial intermediaries. Shareholders should be aware that not all financial intermediaries will offer to sell shares of the Interval Fund or support quarterly repurchase offers by the Interval Fund. SHAREHOLDERS SHOULD CONTACT THEIR FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY AS SOON AS POSSIBLE TO CONFIRM WHETHER THEIR INTERMEDIARY WILL SUPPORT QUARTERLY REPURCHASE OFFERS AND WHAT, IF ANY, EFFECT THE CONVERSION WILL HAVE ON THE SHAREHOLDER'S ACCOUNT.

A return of capital may occur, for example, when some or all of the shareholder's investment is paid back to the shareholder. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect the Fund's investment performance and should not be confused with ˜yield' or ˜income'. When distributions exceed total return performance, the difference will reduce the Fund's net asset value per share. The amounts and sources of distributions reported are only estimates and are being provided to you pursuant to regulatory requirements and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes.

(NYSE: HYT), BlackRock Credit Allocation Income Trust (NYSE: BTZ), BlackRock Limited Duration Income Trust (NYSE: BLW), BlackRock Core Bond Trust (NYSE: BHK) and BlackRock Multi-Sector Income Trust (NYSE: BIT) have adopted a Plan to support a level monthly distribution of income, capital gains and/or return of capital. The fixed amounts distributed per share are subject to change at the discretion of each Fund's Board of Directors/Trustees. Under its Plan, each Fund will distribute all available net income to its shareholders, consistent with its investment objectives and as required by the Code. If sufficient income (inclusive of net investment income and short-term capital gains) is not available on a monthly basis, a Fund will distribute long-term capital gains and/or return capital to its stockholders in order to maintain a level distribution. Each of the above-listed Funds is currently not relying on any exemptive relief from Section 19(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act). Each Fund expects that distributions under the Plan will exceed current income and capital gains and therefore will likely include a return of capital. Each Fund may make additional distributions from time to time, including additional capital gain distributions at the end of the taxable year, if required to meet requirements imposed by the Code and/or the 1940 Act. Each Fund's estimated sources of the distributions paid December 23, 2024 and for its current fiscal year are as follows: Estimated Allocations as of December 23, 2024 Fund Distribution Net Income Net RealizedShort-Term Gains Net RealizedLong-Term Gains Return of Capital EGF2 $0.041000 $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0.041000 (100%) BKT2 $0.088200 $0.031842 (36%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0.056358 (64%) DSU2 $0.098730 $0.066477 (67%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0.032253 (33%) FRA2 $0.123840 $0.082821 (67%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0.041019 (33%) BBN2 $0.092900 $0.075240 (81%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0.017660 (19%) BGT2 $0.120280 $0.077761 (65%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0.042519 (35%) HYT2 $0.077900 $0.057524 (74%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0.020376 (26%) BTZ2 $0.083900 $0.053653 (64%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0.030247 (36%) BLW2 $0.113200 $0.086118 (76%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0.027082 (24%) BHK2 $0.074600 $0.046016 (62%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0.028584 (38%) BIT2 $0.123700 $0.074047 (60%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0.049653 (40%) Estimated Allocations for the Fiscal Year through December 23, 2024 Fund Distribution Net Income Net RealizedShort-Term Gains Net RealizedLong-Term Gains Return of Capital EGF2 $0.492000 $0.347520 (71%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0.144480 (29%) BKT2 $1.058400 $0.407235 (38%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0.651165 (62%) DSU2 $1.184760 $0.868317 (73%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0.316443 (27%) FRA2 $1.486080 $1.167738 (79%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0.318342 (21%) BBN2 $1.114800 $0.909791 (82%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0.205009 (18%) BGT2 $1.443360 $1.035274 (72%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0.408086 (28%) HYT2 $0.934800 $0.708910 (76%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0.225890 (24%) BTZ2 $1.006800 $0.674191 (67%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0.332609 (33%) BLW2 $1.326600 $1.109627 (84%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0.216973 (16%) BHK2 $0.895200 $0.565787 (63%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0.329413 (37%) BIT2 $1.484400 $0.919736 (62%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0.564664 (38%) 2The Fund estimates that it has distributed more than its income and net-realized capital gains in the current fiscal year; therefore, a portion of your distribution may be a return of capital. A return of capital may occur, for example, when some or all of the shareholder's investment is paid back to the shareholder. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect the Fund's investment performance and should not be confused with ˜yield' or ˜income'. When distributions exceed total return performance, the difference will reduce the Fund's net asset value per share. The amounts and sources of distributions reported are only estimates and are being provided to you pursuant to regulatory requirements and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon each Fund's investment experience during the remainder of its fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. Each Fund will send its stockholders a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year that will illustrate how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes.

Elon Musk’s xAI announced Monday it raised $6 billion in a Series C funding round, putting the company’s value at more than $40 billion as it continues to strengthen its AI products and infrastructure. The funding round was announced Monday. (Photo by Muhammed Selim Korkutata/Anadolu via Getty Images) The company closed the $6 billion round and said the funding would be allocated toward products and infrastructure, likely referring to its Grok AI model and the multibillion-dollar supercomputer site in Memphis, Tennessee, used to train its AI models. Investors included Blackrock, A16Z, Saudi conglomerate holding company Kingdom Holding, Fidelity and Sequoia Capital, the latter three of which participated in xAI’s $6 billion Series B funding round in May. The latest funding round puts xAI’s valuation over $40 billion at least, as multiple reports have placed the value of Musk’s company at $40 billion or $50 billion. xAI said in its funding announcement it is training Grok 3, which is not yet available and was slated for release by the end of the year, according to a tweet from Musk in June.

That is how much money xAI has raised this year from their Series B and Series C funding rounds, which included investors such as Morgan Stanley, Kingdom Holding, Andreessen Horowitz, chip designer Nvidia and semiconductor firm AMD. xAI has spent 2024 building its AI language models and the supercomputer used to train them. The computer, dubbed “Colossus,” features 100,000 Nvidia graphics processing units used to train AI and will eventually be doubled in size, allowing it to take on a significantly high training workload. Sam Altman, the CEO of xAI competitor OpenAI, lauded the short time needed to get the supercomputer operational and said during The New York Times DealBook Summit he assumes Musk’s firm will become “a really serious competitor” (OpenAI so far exceeds xAI’s value with a massive $157 billion valuation). Grok 2, xAI’s AI model, is available to users on X, formerly known as Twitter, though it does not yet operate on a standalone app the same way OpenAI’s ChatGPT does. Grok 3 will reportedly boast more computing power and improved responsiveness of its predecessor, according to the chatbot.

Investors gave a minimum of $77,593, per the filing (97 participated, but the document doesn’t reveal their identities). xAI later announced (confirming some earlier reporting) that Andreessen Horowitz , Blackrock, Fidelity, Kingdom Holdings, Lightspeed, MGX, Morgan Stanley, OIA, QIA, Sequoia Capital, Valor Equity Partners, Vy Capital, Nvidia, AMD, and others numbered among them. The new cash brings xAI’s total raised to $12 billion, adding to the $6 billion tranche xAI raised this spring. CNBC reported in November that xAI was aiming for a $50 billion valuation — double its valuation of six months prior. According to the Financial Times, only investors who’d backed xAI in its previous fundraising round were permitted to participate in this one. Reportedly, investors who helped finance Musk’s Twitter acquisition were given access to up to 25% of xAI’s shares. Musk formed xAI last year. Soon after, the company released Grok, a flagship generative AI model that now powers a number of features on X, including a chatbot accessible to X Premium subscribers and free users in some regions. Grok has what Musk has described as “a rebellious streak” — a willingness to answer “spicy questions that are rejected by most other AI systems.” Told to be vulgar, for example, Grok will happily oblige, spewing profanities and colorful language you won’t hear from ChatGPT. Musk has derided ChatGPT and other AI systems for being too “woke” and “politically correct,” despite Grok’s own unwillingness to cross certain boundaries and hedge on political subjects. He’s also referred to Grok as “maximally truth-seeking” and less biased than competing models, although there’s evidence to suggest that Grok leans to the left. Over the past year, Grok has become increasingly ingrained in X, the social network formerly known as Twitter. At launch, Grok was only available to X users — and developers skilled enough to get the “open source” edition up and running. Thanks to an integration with the open image generator Flux, Grok can generate images on X (without guardrails, controversially). The model can analyze images as well, and summarize news and trending events (imperfectly, mind). Reports indicate that Grok may handle even more X functions in the future, from enhancing X’s search capabilities and account bios to helping with post analytics and reply settings. xAI is sprinting to catch up to formidable competitors like OpenAI and Anthropic in the generative AI race. The company launched an API in October, allowing customers to build Grok into third-party apps, platforms, and services. And it just launched a standalone Grok iOS app to a test audience. Musk asserts that it hasn’t been a fair fight. In a lawsuit filed against OpenAI and Microsoft, OpenAI’s close collaborator, attorneys for Musk accuse OpenAI of “actively trying to eliminate competitors” like xAI by “extracting promises from investors not to fund them.” OpenAI, Musk’s counsel says, also unfairly benefits from Microsoft’s infrastructure and expertise in what the attorneys describe as a “de facto merger.” Yet Musk often says that X’s data gives xAI a leg up compared to rivals. Last month, X changed its privacy policy to allow third parties, including xAI, to train models on X posts. Musk, it’s worth noting, was one of the original founders of OpenAI, and left the company in 2018 after disagreements over its direction. He’s argued in previous suits that OpenAI profited from his early involvement yet reneged on its nonprofit pledge to make the fruits of its AI research available to all. xAI has outlined a vision according to which its models would be trained on data from Musk’s various companies, including Tesla and SpaceX, and its models could then improve technology across those companies. It is already powering customer support features for SpaceX’s Starlink internet service, according to The Wall Street Journal, and the startup is said to be in talks with Tesla to provide R&D in exchange for some of the carmaker’s revenue. Tesla shareholders, for one, object to these plans. Several have sued Musk over his decision to start xAI, arguing that Musk has diverted both talent and resources from Tesla to what’s essentially a competing venture. Nevertheless, the deals — and xAI’s developer and consumer-facing products — have driven xAI’s revenue to around $100 million a year. For comparison, Anthropic is reportedly on pace to generate $1 billion in revenue this year, and OpenAI is targeting $4 billion by the end of 2024. Musk said this summer that xAI is training the next generation of Grok models at its Memphis data center, which was apparently built in just 122 days and is currently powered partly by portable diesel generators. The company hopes to upgrade the server farm, which contains 100,000 Nvidia GPUs, next year; in its press release, xAI said it plans to fully double that number. (Because of their ability to perform many calculations in parallel, GPUs are the favored chips for training and running models.) In November, xAI won approval from the regional power authority in Memphis for 150MW of additional power — enough to power roughly 100,000 homes. To win the agency over, xAI pledged to improve the quality of the city’s drinking water and provide the Memphis grid with discounted Tesla-manufactured batteries. But some residents criticized the move, arguing it would strain the grid and worsen the area’s air quality. Tesla is also expected to use the upgraded data center to improve its autonomous driving technologies. xAI has expanded quite rapidly from an operations standpoint in the year since its founding, growing from just a dozen employees in March 2023 to over 100 today. In October, the startup moved into OpenAI’s old corporate offices in San Francisco’s Mission neighborhood. xAI has reportedly told investors it plans to raise more money next year. It won’t be the only AI lab raising immense cash. Anthropic recently secured $4 billion from Amazon, bringing its total raised to $13.7 billion, while OpenAI raised $6.6 billion in October to grow its war chest to $17.9 billion. Megadeals like OpenAI’s and Anthropic’s drove AI venture capital activity to $31.1 billion across over 2,000 deals in Q3 2024, per PitchBook data. TechCrunch has an AI-focused newsletter!

Title: The Protocol: Trump Makes More Pro-Crypto Appointments
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2024/12/23/the-protocol-trump-makes-more-pro-crypto-appointments
Time Published: 2024-12-23T21:15:59Z

Welcome to The Protocol, CoinDesk's weekly wrap-up of the most important stories in cryptocurrency tech development. In this week’s issue of the Protocol newsletter: This article is featured in the latest issue of The Protocol, our weekly newsletter exploring the tech behind crypto, one block at a time. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday. TRUMP CRYPTO APPOINTMENTS: President-elect Donald Trump continues to make high-profile appointments embracing cryptocurrency and emerging technologies in his second term. 1) Stephen Miran, tapped as Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, is a pro-crypto advocate who aims to integrate blockchain and decentralized finance into the U.S. economy. 2) Bo Hines, a former college football player, will head the newly formed Crypto Council. Hines is tasked with balancing innovation and consumer protection as he builds a regulatory framework for digital assets. 3) David Sacks, a veteran of Silicon Valley and vocal blockchain supporter, is stepping in as AI and Crypto Czar. Sacks plans to merge blockchain with AI while bolstering U.S. dominance in both sectors. These appointments signal a clear shift from Trump’s earlier skepticism of digital assets. The big question now is how these moves translate into meaningful policy amid regulatory gridlock and political friction. APTOS LEADERSHIP SHIFT: Aptos Labs CEO and co-founder Mo Shaikh has stepped down, with co-founder Avery Ching taking over as CEO. Shaikh, who will remain a strategic adviser, highlighted the company's achievements, including raising $400 million in venture funding and building a thriving ecosystem supported by partners like BlackRock, Google, Mastercard, and PayPal. Known for its layer-1 blockchain leveraging the Move programming language from Facebook's Diem project, Aptos Labs is expanding into finance and AI applications with the help of advisers like former Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein and OpenAI’s Kevin Weil. The leadership transition underscores the company’s ongoing focus on scalability, security, and innovation in blockchain technology. SONIC TO AIRDROP TIKTOK: Sonic, a Layer 2 solution on the Solana blockchain, has announced plans to airdrop its native token, SONIC, to TikTok users. This initiative aims to introduce TikTok's vast user base to decentralized finance (DeFi) by integrating blockchain technology with social media platforms. The airdrop is part of Sonic's strategy to enhance user engagement and promote the adoption of Layer 2 solutions for improved scalability and reduced transaction costs on the Solana network. By targeting TikTok users, Sonic seeks to bridge the gap between mainstream social media audiences and the DeFi ecosystem, fostering broader participation in decentralized financial services. ALSO: Kraken, the seventh-largest crypto exchange, said its layer-2 rollup network, built on top of the Ethereum blockchain, has gone live. The network, called Ink, is based on the OP stack, a customizable framework that lets developers build their own rollups using Optimism’s technology. The team had originally planned for Ink to go live in early 2025, so the launch of its main network is ahead of schedule. Kraken agreed to receive 25 million OP tokens (worth about $58 million) as part of a deal to build on the OP Stack. Optimism has acknowledged that handing out developer grants for participants building on the stack is part of its strategy, which in turn contributes back to the wider “Superchain” ecosystem.Kraken competitor Coinbase said in August 2023 that it would build a layer-2 network with OP Stack. The product, called Base, is now the second-largest rollup network according to L2beat. At the time, Optimism said the Base team would receive up to 118 million OP tokens and, in return, would contribute the higher of 2.5% of its sequencer revenue or 15% of its profits to the Optimism Collective. Read the full story by Margaux Nijkerk here Fundraising Deals & Grants Data & Tokens Hyper Liquid, a cryptocurrency exchange focused on perpetual contracts, has reported a record outflow of $60 million in USDC amid speculation that North Korea is investigating the platform. The sudden exodus of funds raises questions about the exchange’s liquidity and the stability of its operations. This highlights the growing tension of crypto markets with geopolitical issues, as regulatory scrutiny and potential misuse of platforms by state actors come into focus. The incident underscores the vulnerabilities in crypto markets, particularly for exchanges dealing with high-risk financial products like perpetual contracts. Hyper Liquid’s situation may prompt further scrutiny of similar platforms, emphasizing the need for stronger safeguards in the face of increasing global regulatory pressure.

Investors gobbled up shares of predominantly technology companies last week, following announcements of multi-billion dollars of investments, quantum technology backing, and new contracts, among others. Let’s take a look at last week’s Top 10 Gainers and explore the reasons behind their impressive performance. To come up with the biggest winners of last week, we considered only the stocks that have at least $2 billion in market capitalization and $5 million in daily trading volume. A quantum computer on a countertop in an engineering laboratory with a technician at work. Similar to Rigetti, quantum computing investors continued to watch out closely for clues on industry developments. Over the past year, IonQ’s stock prices registered a jump of 226 percent, sparking interest from investors. In addition, various Wall Street analysts weighed in positively on the technology and on IonQ, specifically. Last Monday, Morgan Stanley Joseph Moore increased his price target for IonQ to $37 from $14.90, saying, “We can’t identify a clear catalyst for this kind of equity appreciation in the space over that time, but we do see continued indications that investment in quantum should continue growing at a rapid pace.” Additionally, Google unveiled its new chip Willo, which also appeared to have had a bullish effect on quantum stocks. Overall, IONQ ranks 4th on our list of biggest gainers of last week. While we acknowledge the potential of IONQ as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than IONQ but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (EL): Among the Biggest Dividend Cuts and Suspensions of 2024

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Biggest Dividend Cuts and Suspensions of 2024. In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL) stands against the other stocks. Dividends hold great appeal for investors—they appreciate receiving them and strongly dislike reductions. Despite this, numerous major companies have reduced their dividend payments over time for various reasons. This trend, which gained momentum in 2020, persists as many companies continue to recover from the financial impact of the pandemic, leading to further dividend cuts. According to research by McKinsey, outside of financial crises, only 1% to 2% of dividend-paying companies reduce their payouts annually, typically involving seven or eight major firms. The key for investors is to identify such companies in advance and avoid them until after the dividend has been reduced, which can present new opportunities. However, predicting which companies might cut dividends can be challenging. Wolfe Research strategist Chris Senyek highlighted three warning signs: excessively high yields, which may indicate underlying problems; high debt levels, which divert cash flow to interest payments rather than shareholders; and a high payout of free cash flow, leaving little cushion for the company in times of economic downturns or recessions. Also read: 10 Dividend Stocks For Steady Income While dividend cuts are generally disappointing for investors, Morgan Stanley offers an interesting perspective on them. Although dividend stocks typically suffer when payouts are reduced, some of these stocks might still present opportunities, according to the firm. Companies often cut dividends due to financial difficulties or economic challenges. Research from Morgan Stanley shows that investors usually sell off these stocks in the six months after the cuts are announced. However, once the initial negative reaction is factored in, there may be attractive buying opportunities in certain cases, as noted by strategist Todd Castagno. Here are some comments from the analyst: “In the 6-months following a change in regular quarterly dividend policy, we found companies that announced a dividend cut of more than -25% underperformed the market by -1,200 bps, on average, while smaller dividend reductions outperformed by +480 bps, on average.” According to Castagno, one year after announcing a dividend reduction, companies that cut their payouts by 30% or less outperformed the market by 1,900 basis points, while those with cuts deeper than 30% lagged the market by 1,800 basis points on average. Morgan Stanley analyzed Russell 1000 dividend-paying companies that reduced their dividends between 1962 and 2024. Over the past year, numerous companies have lowered their payouts, and the firm compiled a list of 30 such companies, excluding those in the financial, utilities, and real estate sectors. While many firms implemented significant dividend cuts, several reduced their dividends by 30% or less. That said, many companies have regained strong footing and recovered quickly after the pandemic, which has led to a decline in the number of dividend cuts over the years. A report by S&P Dow Jones Indices revealed that only 27 companies reduced their dividends in Q3 2024, marking a 56.5% decrease from 62 companies in Q3 2023. The total value of these cuts was $4.6 billion in Q3 2024, down from $9.2 billion in the same quarter the previous year. Over the 12 months ending in September 2024, 140 companies reduced their dividend payments, a significant 70.8% drop from 479 cuts in the prior 12-month period. The overall value of dividend decreases for the current period was $19.5 billion, a 26.4% reduction compared to $26.4 billion during the previous 12 months. Despite these encouraging numbers, many major companies have disappointed investors by reducing their dividend payouts in 2024. Our Methodology: For this list, we checked companies that have announced dividend reductions in 2024 due to the current market conditions and other factors and picked 10 prominent names from that list. Next, we ranked these stocks according to the number of hedge fund investors having stakes in them at the end of Q3 2024, according to Insider Monkey's database. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

(NYSE:EL) is an American multinational cosmetics company that offers a wide range of related products and services. Due to the complexities of the prestige beauty market, including the challenges in predicting the timing of recovery in mainland China and Asia travel retail, the company slashed its dividend to a more suitable payout ratio. This reduction also provides greater financial flexibility for the incoming leadership team to accelerate the company's profitable growth. The company still considers dividends an important part of its capital allocation strategy, provided the payout ratio is appropriate. In fiscal Q1 2025, The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL) reported revenue of $3.36 billion, down by 4.5% from the same period last year. Despite its challenges, the company is working to overcome its struggles. It has seen strong organic sales growth in the Skin Care category, particularly in the EMEA markets, driven by the popularity of its night-time innovations. In addition, the company achieved significant share gains in prestige Skin Care in China for the second consecutive quarter, led by La Mer. The company has also advanced its strategy to capitalize on the growth opportunities in Fragrance. It expanded the reach of its luxury and artisanal portfolio and launched BALMAIN Beauty, aiming to solidify its strategic position in the luxury Fragrance market. This was reflected in the quarter when the company became the top-ranked player in Japan’s Fragrance category, driven by Le Labo and Jo Malone London. The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL) ended the quarter with $2.35 billion available in cash and cash equivalents. During the quarter, it returned $0.24 billion to shareholders through dividends. The company pays a quarterly dividend of $0.35 per share for a dividend yield of 1.88%, as of December 22. As per Insider Monkey's database of Q3 2024, 49 hedge funds owned stakes in The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL), up from 47 in the previous quarter. These stakes have a consolidated value of over $1.87 billion. Among these hedge funds, D E Shaw was the company's leading stakeholder in Q3. Overall EL ranks 3rd on our list of the stocks with the biggest dividend cuts in 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of EL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than EL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 21 Leggett & Platt, Incorporated (NYSE:LEG) is a Missouri-based manufacturing company that mainly specializes in products found in homes and automobiles. Before slashing its dividend this year, the company was a Dividend King with 52 consecutive years of dividend growth under its belt. Unfortunately, the company can no longer be considered a dividend grower following its decision to implement an 89% dividend cut earlier this year. This move wasn’t unexpected, as the company's cash flow had been persistently volatile, putting pressure on its balance sheet. Free cash flow, which stood at over $602 million in 2020, declined to $497.2 million by 2023. As a result, the stock is down by over 63% since the start of 2024. Leggett & Platt, Incorporated (NYSE:LEG) reported mixed earnings in the third quarter of 2024. The company's revenue of $1.10 billion fell by 6.27% from the same period last year. The revenue also missed analysts' estimates by $2.12 million. Despite this, the company managed to reduce its debt by $124 million, and its adjusted EBIT margin improved by 60 basis points sequentially during the quarter. That said, Leggett & Platt, Incorporated (NYSE:LEG) is not completely out of the woods as management indicated that weak demand in residential end markets is likely to continue into the fourth quarter, driven by a challenging macroeconomic environment and reduced consumer spending. Furthermore, the Automotive segment remains under pressure due to challenges associated with the shift to electric vehicles, affordability concerns among consumers, and economic weakness in Europe. Consequently, the company has revised its sales and earnings per share (EPS) guidance downward. Leggett & Platt, Incorporated (NYSE:LEG) currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.05 per share and has a dividend yield of 2.06%, as recorded on December 22. As per Insider Monkey's database of Q3 2024, 21 hedge funds held stakes in Leggett & Platt, Incorporated (NYSE:LEG), the same as in the previous quarter. The overall value of these stakes is over $127.7 million. With over 2.1 million shares, D E Shaw was the company's leading stakeholder in Q3. Overall LEG ranks 7th on our list of the stocks with the biggest dividend cuts in 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of LEG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than LEG but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Time Published: 2024-12-23T17:26:53Z

The recently-released 2025 Crypto Market Outlook report by Coinbase Institutional provides a comprehensive analysis of the cryptocurrency industry’s trajectory. Cryptocurrencies are evolving beyond their speculative origins, with the total market capitalization surging 96% in 2024 to reach $3.4 trillion by December. Coinbase attributes this growth to significant milestones such as the approval of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S. and the rapid proliferation of tokenized real-world assets (RWAs). Coinbase highlights the pivotal role of institutional players in driving crypto adoption. Inflows into spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, led by BlackRock and Fidelity, totaled $30.7 billion in 2024, illustrating the confidence of traditional asset managers in digital assets. Beyond ETFs, tokenized government securities and private credit have been embraced by firms such as BlackRock and Franklin Templeton. Tokenized RWAs grew by 60% in 2024 to a market size of $13.5 billion, with projections suggesting growth could exceed $30 trillion over the next five years. This transformation is expected to streamline cross-border settlements and create 24/7 markets for traditionally illiquid assetshe “Killer App” of Crypto** Coinbase calls stablecoins the “killer app” of the crypto ecosystem, noting their 48% market cap growth in 2024 to $193 billion. Stablecoins settled $27.1 trillion in transactions during the year, triple the amount in 2023. According to Coinbase, innovations in programmable stablecoins and their integration into global payment systems are unlocking unprecedented efficiencies for remittances and cross-border commerce. Coinbase looks at the role of stablecoins in addressing systemic challenges like the U.S. debt burden, and says policymakers are increasingly recognizing their potential . The report sheds light on groundbreaking innovations such as Ethereum’s Dencun upgrade in March 2024, which cut rollup transaction costs by up to 90%. The adoption of layer-2 solutions has surged, with daily transactions on Ethereum-based rollups growing by 289% in 2024. These advancements are making blockchain technology more scalable, cost-effective, and user-friendly. Further upgrades, like Ethereum’s Pectra fork planned for early 2025, aim to enhance network efficiency while laying the groundwork for smart wallet adoption . Regulatory clarity is highlighted as a key driver for crypto market growth in 2025. Coinbase notes that progress in global regulatory frameworks has improved institutional confidence in the asset class. Developments in major jurisdictions, including the United States, Europe, and Asia, are expected to shape a more predictable environment for both investors and developers. Coinbase emphasizes that clearer regulations will foster greater consumer trust and accelerate mainstream adoption of digital assets. The integration of arlligence (AI) and blockchain technology is identified as a major trend. Coinbase describes the emergence of autonomous AI agents capable of managing crypto wallets and facilitating transactions as a potential game-changer. While the long-term implications remain uncertain, the convergence of AI and crypto could unlock novel use cases and drive further adoption .

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 9 Best Trucking Stocks To Buy. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Knight-Swift Transportation Holdings Inc. (NYSE:KNX) stands against the other best trucking stocks. Trucking stocks are businesses that offer both local and long-distance freight and cargo transportation and transfer services. According to Global Market Insights, the growing urbanization and infrastructure development are expected to fuel the global freight trucking industry, which was valued at $2.5 trillion in 2023 and is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 4.2% between 2024 and 2032. The market is divided into local and long-haul groups based on distance. The local segment’s market share was approximately 55% in 2023, and by 2032, it is anticipated to surpass $1.5 trillion. The freight trucking market is divided into many segments based on trucks, including refrigerated trucks, flatbed trucks, truck trailers, and lorry tanks. In 2023, the truck trailer segment’s market share was approximately 36%. In terms of revenue share, the North American freight trucking market had a 35% position in 2023. Connectivity is anticipated to be crucial in changing these market segments as the industry develops further. Rupert Stuetzle, general manager of EMEA manufacturing and mobility, stated, “When we look at full logistics-as-a-service solutions, connected services could support higher-level services beyond road transport.” According to a research report by McKinsey & Company, improvements in fleet management, driver assistance, and the adoption of zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs) could open up a profit pool of over $3 billion by 2035 because of connected, data-enabled services in commercial vehicles. For instance, fleet management systems already assist big retailers in reducing their diesel usage by up to 8%, and linked ZEVs allow for charge planning and route optimization. By 2030, it is projected that 20–25% of new vehicle sales in the US and 40% in Europe will be ZEVs. Additionally, generative AI is simplifying aftermarket services and vehicle design, with OEM-neutral solutions and new data marketplaces opening up new revenue streams. Initiatives like Eclipse SDV and COVESA are building open data standards, which will improve fleet connection and operational efficiency. The truck sales industry is anticipated to stay stable in 2024 as a result of these standards. According to the S&P Mobility report, truck sales are likely to stay unchanged in 2024, but due to better economic conditions and the incentive to purchase before 2027 diesel-truck pollution regulations take effect, momentum is anticipated to rise toward a record-setting 2026. Through the midterm, the industry’s adoption of electric cars will be shaped by federal Greenhouse Gas Phase 3 emission regulations and California’s Advanced Clean Trucks law. As per S&P Mobility, the industry’s zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) ambitions and aspirations are at a crossroads in the next 36 months. However, recently, the American Transportation Research Institute (ATRI) claimed that the trucking business is suffering greatly as a result of traffic congestion on US highways. According to ATRI’s Cost of Congestion research, operating expenses soared despite fewer hours of congestion, costing the U.S. trucking industry $108.8 billion in 2022—a 15% increase from 2021. This translates to $7,588 per registered truck and more than 430,000 truck drivers sitting idle for a year. Texas, California, and Florida led state costs with $9.17 billion, $8.77 billion, and $8.44 billion, respectively, accounting for 52% of overall costs. The cities with the largest urban delays were Chicago ($3.14 billion), Miami ($3.2 billion), and New York City ($6.68 billion). Fuel expenses rose by $32.1 billion due to the waste of 6.4 billion gallons of diesel. With the holiday season around the corner, the trucking and logistics industry is experiencing strong Christmas demand, fueled by high consumer spending and e-commerce. According to the National Retail Federation, retail sales are projected to surge by 2.5% to 3.5% over 2023, with a near-record 197 million shoppers expected over Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday. In addition, According to a survey, 48% of small and medium-sized businesses anticipate more holiday sales than they did the year before. “Despite negative expectations, the U.S. consumer is still in healthy shape,” remarked Mazen Danaf, staff applied scientist and economist at Uber Freight. Despite supply chain issues and port disruptions, growth has been fueled by investments in fulfillment and route optimization, record Black Friday and Cyber Monday online sales, and faster delivery times.

We sifted through stocks from Transportation ETF and from the resultant dataset, we chose 9 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors, using Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds in Q3 2024 to gauge hedge fund sentiment for stocks. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here) Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 30 One of the Best Freight Stocks, Knight-Swift Transportation Holdings Inc. (NYSE:KNX), is the largest truckload carrier in the United States, delivering a wide range of transportation services. According to the company’s asset-based trucking business, approximately 82% of revenue comes from the U.S. Xpress deal pro forma. Full truckload (for-hire dry van, refrigerated, and dedicated contract) accounts for 69% of revenue, while less than truckload accounts for 13%. Intermodal accounts for around 6% of revenue, while truck brokerage and other asset-light logistics services account for 9%. The firm’s intermodal operations comprise drayage (regional trucking services to and from inland intermodal ramps/terminals) and the underlying movement of its shipping containers on Class I railroads. Services provided to shippers and third-party truckers, such as equipment leasing and maintenance, make up the remaining revenue. Knight-Swift Transportation Holdings Inc. (NYSE:KNX)’s bull case is its rising less-than-truckload (LTL) business, which had a 16.7% revenue increase yearly in Q3 of 2024, due to network development with 16 new locations and the DHE purchase. Improvements in the operating ratio also indicate operational efficiency, and the logistics segment’s increased revenue per load by 13.6% YoY shows pricing power. Additionally, in Q3 of 2024, the operating cash increased by 41.46% yearly. Knight-Swift Transportation Holdings Inc. (NYSE:KNX) price objective was increased from $62 to $68. According to the company, significantly higher less-than-truckload multiples indicate that the market is excited about opportunities beyond the current slowdown. In a research note, the analyst informs investors that Barclays’ updated upcycle analysis implies considerable profit growth potential through 2026. The company argues that an upcycle study reveals the group has a lot of volume potential, which is strengthened by share increases in addition to demand recovery. Dmitry Balyasny’s Balyasny Asset Management was the largest stakeholder in the company from among the funds in Insider Monkey’s database. It owns 3.75 million shares worth $202.11 million as of Q3. Overall, KNX ranks 7th on our list of the best trucking stocks. While we acknowledge the potential for KNX as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Title: Is Diamondback Energy (FANG) the Top Oil and Gas Stock to Invest in According to Hedge Funds?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Top 12 Oil and Gas Stocks To Invest In According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Diamondback Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:FANG) stands against other oil and gas stocks to invest in according to hedge funds. With a record average production of 12.9 million barrels per day in 2023, the United States is the Biggest Oil Producing Country in the World. Every year, the indigenous production of oil and gas helps save American consumers an estimated $203 billion, or $2,500 for each family of four. Moreover, the oil and gas industry supports over 12 million American jobs, provides billions of dollars in tax revenue, and ensures energy security. READ ALSO: 11 Best Cannabis Stocks to Invest In According to OPEC, the global oil demand increased by 2.5 million barrels per day (mb/d) in 2023 to average 102.2 mb/d, surpassing pre-pandemic levels for the first time. The major part of this uptick came from the non-OECD countries, which posted YoY growth of about 2.4 mb/d to average 56.4 mb/d, surpassing pre-pandemic levels for the second consecutive year. As per the IEA’s recent market outlook, growth in the global demand for oil is expected to slow down in the coming years as energy transitions advance. However, despite the sluggish growth, the world oil demand is still forecast to be 3.2 mb/d higher in 2030 than in 2023, unless stronger policy measures are implemented or changes in behavior take hold. As 2024 comes to a close, oil prices have moved in the narrowest range this year since 2019, with Brent crude oil prices exhibiting a minimal average monthly change and a monthly range-bound movement between $69 and $90. The general opinion is that a soft demand, coupled with an abundant supply, even on hold, has contributed to the relative stability we witnessed this year. China’s faltering economy and its shift towards electric vehicles and LNG-fueled trucks weighed heavily on the crude oil demand this year. According to a recent report by the state-owned China National Petroleum Corporation, the world’s largest oil-importing country may see its demand peak in 2025, five years earlier than expected, as the shift away from fossil fuels accelerates. The report reveals that China’s oil demand could reach 770 million tons next year, before gradually falling to 240 million tons by 2060. As a consequence of the slowdown in the global oil demand, Brent futures prices have shed more than 5% so far this year, setting up a second consecutive annual loss. J.P. Morgan analysts have predicted that the global oil market is widely expected to be in a surplus in 2025, as supply will outpace demand to the tune of 1.2 million b/d. Brent crude prices are forecast to average around $73 a barrel next year, according to a Reuters tally of 11 brokerages that have issued price targets. The bleak outlook has inevitably caused the oil and gas stocks to tumble and the broader market’s Energy sector has dropped by 13.42% over the last month, while the overall market has stayed relatively stable and lost only 0.3% during the same period. However, despite the falling prices and decreasing margins, the oil and gas industry is contributing massively to the global economy and shareholder return. A recent report from Deloitte has revealed that the O&G sector distributed nearly $213 billion in dividends and $136 billion in buybacks between January 2024 and mid-November 2024. Also, over the last four years, the industry’s capital expenditures have increased by 53%, while its net profit has risen by nearly 16%. Moreover, an increasing number of oil majors are now investing in low-carbon technology projects to help balance the risks associated with the traditional fossil fuel market. To collect data for this article, we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds and picked the top 8 companies operating in the oil and gas sector with the highest number of hedge fund investors. When two or more companies had the same number of hedge funds investing in them, we ranked them by the revenue of their last financial year instead. Following are the Best Energy Stocks Held by the Most Hedge Funds. At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

A pipeline worker overseeing the flow of crude oil into storage tanks from an integrated water system. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 49 Diamondback Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:FANG) is a Texas-based independent oil and natural gas company, specializing in unconventional, onshore oil and natural gas reserves in the Permian Basin of West Texas. In September, Diamondback completed its merger with Endeavor Energy Resources, creating a leading operator focused on the Permian Basin. Moreover, the company has also announced an asset trade agreement with TRP Energy, enhancing its Midland Basin position. Diamondback Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:FANG) had a strong Q3 as it reported a revenue uptick of 13%, driven by higher production volumes following the merger and an increase in oil sales. It also had a net income of $659 million and adjusted net income of $698 million for the third quarter. The company reported a free cash flow of $708 million and declared a quarterly dividend of $0.9 per share. Diamondback Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:FANG) has experienced six straight years of dividend growth and has a 5-year dividend CAGR of almost 49%. The company has also increased its share repurchase authorization to $6 billion, demonstrating a commitment to returning capital to shareholders. At the end of Q3 2024, shares of Diamondback Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:FANG) were held by 49 hedge funds in the IM database with a total stake value of $1.67 billion, up by a significant 85.5% from the previous quarter. Chartwell Investment Partners, LLC, said the following about Diamondback Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:FANG) in its Q3 investment letter: “Diamondback Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:FANG) is an exploration and production company with operations focused on the Mid-land and Delaware basins, both located within the Permian Basin in West Texas and southeastern New Mexico. While fundamental performance remains solid, shares were pressured by lower oil prices.” Overall, FANG ranks 10th on our list of oil and gas stocks to invest in according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential for FANG to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Title: 7 Predictions For Crypto In 2025: Bitcoin, ETFs & Global Adoption
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/leeorshimron/2024/12/23/7-predictions-for-crypto-in-2025-bitcoin-etfs--global-adoption/
Time Published: 2024-12-23T15:00:23Z

7 Predictions for Crypto in 2025: Bitcoin, ETFs & Global Adoption The year 2024 marked a historic turning point for Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. It saw the launch of the first Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, signaling genuine institutional adoption. Bitcoin shattered the $100,000 milestone for the first time, while stablecoins continued to reinforce the global dominance of the US dollar. Adding to this momentum, the winning U.S. presidential candidate made support for Bitcoin a central pillar of his campaign. Collectively, these milestones cemented 2024 as the year the crypto industry proved itself to be an unstoppable force on the global stage. As the industry shifts its focus to 2025, here are my seven predictions of major events we can expect to take place next year. 1) A major G7 or BRICS nation will establish and announce a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve The Trump administration’s proposal to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR) for the United States has sparked widespread debate and speculation. While adding Bitcoin to the U.S. Treasury’s balance sheet would require considerable political willpower and congressional approval, the mere suggestion of such an initiative carries profound implications. By signaling the possibility of an SBR, the U.S. effectively invites other major nations to consider a similar move. Game theory suggests that these countries may feel incentivized to preemptively act, potentially front-running the U.S. to secure a strategic advantage in diversifying their national reserves. Bitcoin’s limited supply and its emerging role as a digital store of value could heighten the urgency for nations to act quickly. The race is now on for the first major country to integrate Bitcoin into its reserve strategy, diversifying alongside traditional holdings like gold, foreign currencies, and sovereign bonds. Such a move would not only solidify Bitcoin’s status as a global reserve asset but could also reshape the dynamics of international finance, with far-reaching implications for economic and geopolitical power structures. The establishment of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve by any leading economy could mark the beginning of a new era in sovereign wealth management. 2) Stablecoin growth will continue, doubling to exceed $400 billion Stablecoins have emerged as one of crypto's most successful mainstream use cases, offering a bridge between traditional finance and the crypto ecosystem. Across the globe, millions use stablecoins for remittance payments, everyday transactions, and as a hedge against the volatility of local currencies by accessing the relative stability of the U.S. dollar. In 2024, stablecoins reached an all-time high of $200 billion in circulating supply, dominated by market leaders Tether and Circle. These digital currencies rely on blockchain networks such as Ethereum, Solana, and Tron to facilitate seamless, borderless transactions. Looking ahead, stablecoin growth is poised to accelerate in 2025, potentially doubling to exceed $400 billion. This growth will be fueled by the likely passage of stablecoin-specific legislation, which could provide much-needed regulatory clarity and foster innovation within the sector. U.S. regulators are increasingly recognizing the strategic importance of stablecoins in strengthening the global dominance of the U.S. dollar, reinforcing its status as the world’s reserve currency. Stablecoins reached a new all time high this year exceeding $200 billion in total supply for the ... [+] first time. The growth was led by Tether and Circle's USDC. 3) Bitcoin DeFi enabled by L2s will be a dominant growth trend Bitcoin is evolving beyond its role as a store of value, with Layer 2 (L2) networks like Stacks, BOB, Babylon, CoreDAO, and others unlocking the potential for a thriving Bitcoin DeFi ecosystem. These L2s enhance Bitcoin's scalability and programmability, enabling decentralized finance (DeFi) applications to flourish on the most secure and decentralized blockchain. In 2024, Stacks had a transformative year with the launch of the Nakamoto Upgrade and sBTC. The Nakamoto Upgrade allowed Stacks to inherit 100% Bitcoin finality and introduced faster block speeds, significantly improving user experience. Meanwhile, sBTC, a trustless Bitcoin-pegged asset launched in December, enabled seamless participation in DeFi activities such as lending, borrowing, swapping, and staking—all anchored to Bitcoin’s security. Previously, Bitcoin holders seeking DeFi opportunities were forced to wrap their Bitcoin on other networks like Ethereum. This process relies on centralized custodians such as WBTC (BitGo), BTCB (Binance), and cbBTC (Coinbase), exposing users to centralization and censorship risks. Bitcoin L2s reduce these risks, offering a more decentralized alternative to put Bitcoin to work natively within its own ecosystem. Looking ahead to 2025, Bitcoin DeFi is poised for exponential growth. I predict that the total value locked (TVL) on Bitcoin L2s will surpass the $24 billion currently represented by wrapped Bitcoin derivatives, which accounts for about 1.2% of the total Bitcoin supply. With Bitcoin’s market cap at $2 trillion, L2 networks will enable users to more securely and efficiently unlock this immense latent value, solidifying Bitcoin’s position as a cornerstone of decentralized finance. Wrapped Bitcoin derivative tokens on other blockchains make up over $24 billion or about 1.2% of the ... [+] total Bitcoin supply. 4) Bitcoin ETFs will continue their surge and new crypto-focused ETFs will emerge The launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs marked a historic milestone, becoming the most successful ETF debut in history. Attracting over $108 billion in assets under management (AUM) within its first year, these ETFs demonstrated unparalleled demand from both retail and institutional investors. Major players like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Ark Invest played pivotal roles in bringing regulated Bitcoin exposure to traditional financial markets, setting the stage for a wave of innovation in crypto-focused ETFs. The Bitcoin ETFs were the most successful ETF launch ever. BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF, IBIT, almost ... [+] doubled its Gold ETF, IAU, just in its first year. Following the success of Bitcoin ETFs, Ethereum ETFs debuted, offering investors exposure to the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. Looking ahead, I anticipate that staking will be integrated into Ethereum ETFs for the first time in 2025. This feature would enable investors to earn staking rewards, further enhancing the appeal and utility of these funds. I anticipate that ETFs will soon launch for other leading crypto protocols such as Solana, which has gained prominence for its high-performance blockchain, thriving DeFi ecosystem, and rapid growth in gaming, NFTs and memecoins. Additionally, we are likely to see the introduction of weighted crypto index ETFs designed to offer diversified exposure across the broader crypto market. These indices could include a mix of top-performing assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and others, along with emerging protocols, providing investors with a balanced portfolio that captures the growth potential of the entire ecosystem. Such innovations will make crypto investing more accessible, efficient, and appealing to a wide range of investors, further driving capital into the space. 5) A “Magnificent Seven” company will add Bitcoin to its balance sheet (beyond Tesla) The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) has introduced fair value accounting rules for cryptocurrencies, effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. These new standards require companies to report their crypto holdings, such as Bitcoin, at fair market value, capturing both gains and losses from market fluctuations in real-time. Previously, digital assets were classified as intangible assets, which forced companies to write down impaired holdings while prohibiting the recognition of unrealized gains. This conservative approach often understated the true value of crypto holdings on corporate balance sheets. The updated rules address these limitations, enabling more accurate financial reporting and making cryptocurrencies a more attractive asset for corporate treasuries. The Magnificent Seven—Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Nvidia, Tesla, and Meta—together hold over $600 billion in cash reserves, offering them significant flexibility to allocate a portion of their capital to Bitcoin. With the enhanced accounting framework and increasing regulatory clarity, it’s highly plausible that one of these tech giants, beyond Tesla, will add Bitcoin to its balance sheet. Such a move would reflect prudent financial management by: As the new accounting rules take effect and corporate treasuries adapt, Bitcoin could emerge as a key reserve asset for the world’s largest tech companies, further legitimizing its role in the global financial system. 6) Total crypto market cap will exceed $8 trillion In 2024, the total cryptocurrency market cap surged to an all-time high of $3.8 trillion, encompassing a broad array of use cases, including Bitcoin as a store of value, stablecoins, DeFi, NFTs, memecoins, GameFi, SocialFi, and beyond. This explosive growth reflects the sector's expanding influence and the growing adoption of blockchain-based solutions across diverse industries. By 2025, the influx of developer talent into the crypto ecosystem is expected to accelerate, driving the creation of new applications that achieve product-market fit and onboard millions of additional users. This wave of innovation is likely to spawn breakthrough decentralized applications (dApps) in areas such as artificial intelligence (AI), decentralized finance (DeFi), decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN), and other emerging fields still in their infancy. These transformative dApps, offering tangible utility and solving real-world problems, will fuel increased adoption and economic activity within the ecosystem. As user bases expand and capital flows into the space, asset prices will follow suit, pushing the overall market capitalization to unprecedented heights. With this momentum, the crypto market is on track to surpass $8 trillion, marking continued growth and innovation for the industry. 7) A renaissance for crypto startups, the US will return as the global crypto powerhouse The U.S. crypto industry is on the brink of a transformative resurgence. SEC Chairman Gary Gensler’s controversial “regulation by enforcement” approach, which stifled innovation and drove many crypto startups offshore, will conclude with his departure in January. His successor, Paul Atkins, brings a starkly different perspective. A former SEC commissioner (2002–2008), Atkins is renowned for his pro-crypto stance, support for deregulation, and leadership in initiatives like the Token Alliance, a pro-crypto advocacy group. His approach promises a more collaborative regulatory framework, fostering innovation rather than suppressing it. The end of Operation Chokepoint 2.0, a covert initiative that limited crypto startups’ access to the U.S. banking system, further sets the stage for a renaissance. By restoring equitable access to banking infrastructure, the U.S. is creating an environment where blockchain developers and entrepreneurs can thrive without undue constraints. The improved regulatory clarity and renewed support for innovation will also lead to a significant increase in token launches within the U.S. Startups will feel empowered to issue tokens as part of their fundraising and ecosystem-building efforts without the fear of regulatory backlash. These tokens, ranging from utility tokens for decentralized applications to governance tokens for protocols, will attract domestic and international capital while encouraging participation in U.S.-based projects. Conclusion As we look ahead to 2025, it’s clear that the crypto industry is entering a new era of growth and maturity. With Bitcoin solidifying its role as a global reserve asset, the rise of ETFs, and the exponential growth of DeFi and stablecoins, the groundwork is being laid for widespread adoption and mainstream attention. Supported by clearer regulations and groundbreaking technologies, the crypto ecosystem is set to push boundaries and shape the future of global finance. These predictions highlight a year brimming with potential, as the industry continues to prove itself as an unstoppable force. One Community. Many Voices.

The Financial Times reported that Meta Platforms is looking to add displays to its line of smart glasses, possibly as soon as next year. 7. Honda and Nissan officially began merger talks, with the two signing a memorandum of understanding to consider a business integration. A second memorandum of understanding was also signed that offers Nissan's strategic partner Mitsubishi the chance to join the new company. 8. Xerox will acquire Lexmark, a Chinese-owned printer and printing software maker, in a $1.5 billion deal expected to close in the second half of 2025. 9.

Title: Is Verizon Communications (VZ) One of the Best Stocks to Buy and Hold for 3 Years?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of the 10 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold For 3 Years. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) stands against the other best stocks to buy and hold for 3 years. On December 12, Tom Lee, Fundstrat Global Advisors managing partner and head of research, joined CNBC's 'Closing Bell' to discuss his playbook for 2025. Following two years of significant gains, his playbook suggests an optimistic yet cautious outlook for the stock market next year. Lee anticipates that the S&P 500 will rise to approximately 7,000 by mid-2025, before retreating to around 6,600 by the end of the year. This reflects an overall expected increase of about 8% for the year, which is consistent with historical averages for stock market returns. In terms of Earnings Per Share (EPS) estimates Lee projects EPS for the S&P 500 at $260 in 2025 while estimating $300 for 2026. This is slightly below the consensus estimates from Wall Street, which average around $268 for 2025. READ ALSO: 11 Best Aerospace and Defense Stocks to Buy Right Now and 11 Best Computer Hardware Stocks to Invest in Right Now. Explaining his investment thesis, Lee pointed towards several themes that could drive the market in 2025. He predicts a "tale of two halves," where the first half of the year will see stronger market performance due to factors like Federal Reserve policies and business-friendly initiatives under President Trump. Conversely, he expects a pullback in the second half, reflecting historical trends after strong consecutive years. He sees potential in small-cap stocks, which have underperformed relative to large-cap stocks historically. Lee also talked about the mega caps that are leading. He mentioned that investors reach for these companies when there is even slight risk in the market. Secondly, mega-cap stocks are highly sensitive to falling interest rates. With the December cut in effect, the market is bullish for tech, thereby further solidifying the investment case for megacaps. Despite his generally positive outlook, Lee acknowledges several risks that could impact market performance. For instance, he thinks the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) could potentially lead to reduced government spending and slower economic growth if it is too effective in cutting costs. Moreover, the implementation of tariffs could adversely affect economic conditions and corporate profits. Lee pointed out that historical patterns suggest that after two years of substantial gains, markets often experience declines in the latter half of the third year. A smiling customer receiving customer contact center solutions on their smartphone. To compile the list of 10 best stocks to buy and hold for 3 years, we applied a consensus approach. We sifted through recent articles to get an aggregated list of the best stocks to buy and hold for 3 years. Next, we ranked these stocks based on the number of hedge fund holders as of Q3 2024, sourced from Insider Monkey’s database. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Funds: 57 Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) is a major telecommunication company in the United States. It is one of the largest wireless carriers in the country and holds over 37% market share. The company operates through Verizon Consumer Group and Verizon Business Group segments providing wireless and wired communication and data services. Several points make Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) one of the best stocks to buy and hold for 3 years. Firstly the company has been successful in growing its customer base in a highly competitive market. According to its third-quarter results of fiscal 2024, it achieved 239,000 retail postpaid phone net additions, more than doubling the figure from the previous year. As a result total wireless service revenue reached $19.8 billion, indicating a 2.7% increase year-over-year. The growth has not been limited to merely the Wireless segment, its Broadband Segment also witnessed an addition of 389,000 broadband connections. This marked the ninth consecutive quarter with over 375,000 net additions. Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) has been actively working to expand its fiber network to accelerate its offering of premium broadband and mobility services. To achieve this, management on September 5 announced a strategic acquisition of Frontier Communications, the largest pure-play fiber provider in the United States, for $20 billion. The acquisition will increase its fiber customer base to approximately 25 million subscribers. Management has set an ambitious goal to reach 30 million fiber customers by 2028, with a long-term target of between 35 million and 40 million. Third Point Management stated the following regarding Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “While some economic activity has been showing signs of slowing, the defensive composition of the current high yield market with a high mix of higher quality credit and short duration has let the rates tailwind overwhelm such concerns. The lowest quality sectors of the market have performed best, fueled by both soft/no landing expectations, as well as two positive events in the beleaguered telecom space. Telecom/cable have been poor performers year to date due to overhang from the growth of FWA (aka “wireless cable”) and increased fiber building, however the sector re-rated materially on two deals. Second, Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) announced a deal to acquire Frontier Communications (FYBR), a transaction which the fund benefited from by virtue of its investment in FYBR debt. This transaction, aimed at increasing’s VZ fiber footprint, has led to broad revaluation of fiber retail networks that we think is appropriate. While we continue to expect to see FWA rapidly erode non-upgraded cable and especially copper’s share of the low-end broadband market, the VZ deal underscores the value of the higher end footprint.” Overall, VZ ranks 10th on our list of best stocks to buy and hold for 3 years. While we acknowledge the potential of VZ to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than VZ but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

December 23, 2024 09:17 ET | Source: Bitget Bitget VICTORIA, Seychelles, Dec. 23, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bitget, the leading cryptocurrency exchange and Web3 company, has listed Usual (USUAL). Trading for the USUAL/USDT pair has started, with deposits and withdrawals available. Usual is an innovative fiat-backed stablecoin protocol focused on security and decentralization. As a multi-chain infrastructure, Usual integrates tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) from entities such as BlackRock, Ondo, and Mountain Protocol, converting them into a permissionless, on-chain verifiable, and composable stablecoin USD0. When users deposit RWAs or USDC/USDT (with a third party providing RWA collateral), they receive USD0, which represents the initial value of the deposit and can be traded freely. $USUAL is the revenue-based governance token of the project. Different from conventional revenue-sharing models redistributing part of the revenue generated by stablecoins, the platform prioritizes user-centric mechanisms by redistributing 100% of value and control through its governance token. This mechanism not only redistributes revenue, it also redistributes ownership of the system, providing incentives for early adopters and offering token holders long-term upside potential. By listing USUAL, Bitget reinforces its commitment to supporting innovative DeFi projects. The inclusion of USUAL aligns with the platform’s broader vision to empower users with access to forward-thinking financial solutions that drive Web3 development. This listing enhances Bitget’s growing portfolio of decentralized finance offerings and introduces traders to a leading protocol at the intersection of stablecoins and tokenized real-world assets.

December 23, 2024 07:30 ET | Source: Matador Technologies Inc. Matador Technologies Inc. TORONTO, Dec. 23, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Matador Technologies Inc. (“Matador” or the “Company”) (TSXV: MATA) is proud to announce that its Board of Directors has unanimously approved adding Bitcoin and USD-denominated assets to its corporate treasury as part of its long-term capital preservation strategy. The Board has identified risks associated with its current treasury, which is primarily denominated in Canadian dollars. Canada’s reliance on oil exports and its rising national debt raise concerns about potential devaluation and loss of purchasing power for Canadian denominated assets. To address these risks, the Board has approved adding Bitcoin and USD-denominated assets to its corporate treasury.1 Matador plans to front-load an initial allocation of $4.5 million into Bitcoin in the month of December 2024 and will continue to explore additional purchases at the board level via measured buying programs. Additionally, Matador plans to move the majority of its cash balance sheet from CAD to USD. The decision reflects Matador’s belief in Bitcoin’s role as a store of value asset that mitigates the downside risk of currency debasement. This move follows global trends, as institutional adoption of Bitcoin grows among corporations seeking alternatives to bonds and depreciating currencies.2 “Matador’s Board and management believe in using Bitcoin to future-proof our treasury,” Sunny Ray, President of Matador, added. “This step also supports our mission to explore using Bitcoin as a platform for our gold-based products.” This move will continue to support the development and launch of Matador’s digital gold platform, which is a technology-based system that enables users to own, trade, and store digital representations of gold, backed by physical reserves with the physical gold being held at the Royal Canadian Mint. These holdings are expected to underpin the company’s product development efforts and reinforce confidence in the Company’s treasury management strategy. After an initial review of alternative platforms, including Ethereum and Solana, the Board believes that Bitcoin stands apart in its ability to deliver the security, stability, and trustworthiness required for a digital gold asset platform. Bitcoin’s deep liquidity and widespread institutional adoption further support the belief that Bitcoin is the ideal foundation for Matador’s vision of a trustworthy, digital gold platform.3 “For Matador’s focus on creating a product that exemplifies trust, permanence, and value, we expect Bitcoin to be the platform of choice,” said Deven Soni, CEO and Chairman of Matador. The Board will further evaluate its technology platform alternatives in the near future, with the objective of making a decision on which technology platform will underpin its digital gold product in Q1 2025. Once a decision has been made, Matador intends on launching its digital gold product to a limited audience. Matador will continue to update shareholders regarding its treasury execution and custody strategy in the coming weeks. About Matador Technologies Inc. Matador Technologies Inc. is a digital gold platform leveraging blockchain technology to digitize real-world assets like gold. Focused on building innovative financial solutions, Matador is at the forefront of integrating blockchain technology to preserve and grow value. It’s digital gold platform aims to democratize the gold buying experience, combining the best of modern technology and time-proven assets, to create an app that will allow users to buy, sell, and store gold 24/7, with the added security and flexibility of an encrypted mobile application.

Title: US House committee targets another investor climate group
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/us-house-committee-targets-another-investor-climate-group-3786695
Time Published: 2024-12-23T12:20:48Z

By Ross Kerber (Reuters) - The Republican-led U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Committee is seeking information from some 60 U.S. asset managers about their involvement with an investor climate group, adding pressure against environmental efforts by large investors. Letters sent on Friday to members of the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative, or NZAM, were signed by committee Chairman Jim Jordan and Representative Thomas Massie. They made claims in line with a committee report released on Dec. 13 that Republicans say showed fund firms colluded to cut emissions. The committee's Democrats have dismissed such claims, and big fund firms have denied similar charges. Representatives for companies that received the letter including BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), State Street (NYSE:STT) and JPMorgan Asset Management did not immediately comment when contacted late on Friday. Republicans previously have taken credit for prompting those three fund managers to step back from another investor group, the Climate Action (WA:ACT) 100+. NZAM says it is an international group with more than 325 signatories managing $57.5 trillion, according to its website. Members pledge to support the goal of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, using influence such as how they vote their proxies at corporate meetings. The letters from Jordan and Massie state that companies' efforts with NZAM and the affiliated Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero "may violate U.S. antitrust law," citing the earlier report. They ask for information such as how companies' participation in NZAM changed their stewardship strategies. Mindy Lubber, CEO of Boston-based environmental advocacy group Ceres, an organizing partner of NZAM, said in an interview that the letters were "consistent with other efforts to suggest that investors ought not to consider climate risk, when of course they should be aware of climate risk as part of their fiduciary duty."

Title: Can Ethereum Break $3,500 Before End Of 2024? Analyst Weighs In

As 2024 nears its conclusion, Ethereum price fluctuations are being closely monitored. The trajectory of the cryptocurrency is critically influenced by key resistance and support levels, as indicated by recent analysis from crypto experts, which suggests a cautiously optimistic outlook. Analyzing cryptocurrencies, Justin Bennett emphasized the importance of Ethereum recovering the $3,540 level over the weekly period on December 22. This pricing range is regarded as necessary to show a potential change in the market toward optimism. Should Ethereum be unable to clear this barrier, it runs the danger of sliding below the significant support zone of $3,000, leading to a drop toward $2,600. For investors as well as speculators, a drop of this degree would be costly. As bullish as I’m turning with the overall setup going into 2025, buyers still have work to do. For example, $ETH needs to recover $3,540 on the weekly time frame to look bullish next week. Buyers have 33 hours to get it done.#Ethereum pic.twitter.com/cAChCbJxjd — Justin Bennett (@JustinBennettFX) December 21, 2024 The analysis by Titan of Crypto who utilized the Ichimoku cloud approach to predict probable recovery further strengthens the optimism surrounding Ethereum. The analyst noted that Ethereum has retested some critical levels, which gives the impression that the present correction cycle is about nearing its end. The strength of Kumo Cloud’s support line indicates that Ethereum may well form a base for higher moves if it can manage to hold on to the existing levels. Meanwhile, Ethereum whales have increased their holdings and amassed about 340,000 ETH, which is worth more than $1 billion, in just a few days. This rise in accumulation shows that big investors are becoming more confident of the prospects of the altcoin. Ethereum Whales Bought $1 Billion ETH In The Past 96 Hours – Details https://t.co/fZe8jWmQ3S — Jose JM (@CryptoJoseJM) December 22, 2024 In addition, spot Ethereum ETFs have garnered inflows of over $2 billion since their introduction in the US market, which is indicative of the growing interest in these instruments. If regulatory authorities permit staking yields within these funds, analysts anticipate that this trend could surpass Bitcoin ETFs by 2025. At the time of writing, Ether was trading at $3,330, down 0.7% and 15.7% in the daily and weekly timeframes, data from Coingecko shows. Based on how the Ethereum market is doing right now, there will likely be a positive upward trend within the next week, despite Ether’s numbers flashing red in the charts. Analysts are hopeful about its chances of recovering, even though it is selling at a 21% discount to what they think it will be worth in a month. A potential breakout that could test critical resistance levels is being indicated by technical indicators such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Moving Averages. Ethereum is anticipated to experience a robust development trajectory in the medium to long term, with a 35% price increase within the next three months and a remarkable 100% growth within a year, according to projections.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Discussed These 11 Restaurants and Retail Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Brinker International, Inc. (NYSE:EAT) stands against the other restaurant and retail stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about. Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, recently took a closer look at the state of the consumer, focusing on restaurants and retailers to understand the broader economic picture. According to Cramer, there is a common misconception about the economy, where people tend to think of the consumer as one homogenous group. He pointed out that there isn't a single consumer whose behavior can explain the overall economic trends. Instead, Cramer identified two distinct types of consumers in today's market. “One consumer's going out looking for absolute bargains. The other consumer's looking for what I call “premium value” or “value at a price”. More expensive, but relative to similar offerings, you get a great deal.” READ ALSO Jim Cramer Recently Discussed These 7 Stocks and 6 Stocks Jim Cramer Talked About This Week This conclusion came after Cramer listened to a variety of retail and restaurant earnings calls. He expressed skepticism about relying on broad aggregate data, such as national retail sales, which he believes doesn’t capture the full picture. Instead, Cramer prefers analyzing individual companies, piecing together information from different sources to form a clearer sense of the consumer landscape. He believes this approach provides a more accurate snapshot than relying on overarching statistics. Cramer also noted that the rise of these two different consumer types has perplexed Wall Street. In the past, there was typically one consumer who either spent or didn’t, but that has changed. Now, there are two groups of consumers, each spending in different places. In his conclusion, Cramer urged investors to stop focusing on whether consumers are struggling financially or facing challenges. The key, he said, is understanding choice. “The bottom line: Stop trying to figure out if the consumer's cash strapped. Forget the headwinds. What matters is choice. Right now, consumers are lapping up absolute value at the lowest price or premium value, meaning better stuff that's a good deal versus the competition. But everything else? Maybe not so much. Hence why the aggregate numbers just don't tell the story.” Our Methodology For this article, we compiled a list of 11 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the recent episode of Mad Money on December 19. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the third quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A Chili's Grill & Bar restaurant filled with happy customers enjoying a meal. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 41 Cramer highlighted Brinker International, Inc.’s (NYSE:EAT) Chilli’s low-priced meals and said: “At the same time, there's the other consumer who only seeks absolute bargains, the under $11 meal at Chili's owned by Brinker…” Brinker (NYSE:EAT) owns, operates, and franchises casual dining restaurants, with two main brands: Chili’s Grill & Bar and Maggiano’s Little Italy. In the first quarter of fiscal 2025, it reported a 13.0% increase in comparable restaurant sales, driven by a 14.1% rise at Chili’s and a 4.2% increase at Maggiano’s. The growth at Chili’s was mainly attributed to menu price adjustments and a boost in customer traffic. Popular menu items, including the “Big Smasher” burger and Triple Dipper, have resonated well with guests, while the “3 for Me” combo meals have been particularly effective in attracting customers. Brinker (NYSE:EAT) management highlighted that the “3 for Me” deal, in particular, has been a key driver of traffic, appealing to a broad range of demographics by offering significant value. The data also showed that this offering has brought in more new guests, with those who purchase “3 for Me” returning to Chili’s more frequently than those who did not opt for the deal. Management emphasized that the appeal of high-quality, affordable meals, coupled with a great dining experience, is driving repeat visits across all income levels. Overall EAT ranks 7th on our list of the restaurant and retail stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about. While we acknowledge the potential of EAT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than EAT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: AI ignited a private market boom. Now wealthy investors want more

Time Published: 2024-12-23T10:00:00Z

Wealthy investors are flocking to artificial intelligence startups — and fueling a private market renaissance. To get a piece of today’s pioneering AI firms, investors have to go through private markets, where most tech startups still reside. Waves of new technology have long meant new companies and eager investors hoping to be among the first to pour money into the next big thing. But the AI boom comes at a time where there are significantly more private companies, and they are tending to wait longer to go public. The draw of getting in on AI is serving as a gateway for well-heeled investors to pour more money into a wider array of private companies, wealth managers and others say. The rise of AI has sparked a constellation of startups promising to provide the data, infrastructure, chips, energy, and models to support the technology. Some of the biggest players in AI, including OpenAI, Anthropic, and Perplexity, are private companies. While anyone can buy and sell shares of publicly traded companies, private markets are more restricted, typically open only to accredited or institutional investors. Over the past two years, nascent interest in private market investment has grown into considerable activity, said Michael Gaviser, head of private markets at Morgan Stanley (MS+2.10%) Wealth Management. The total size of all companies on U.S. private markets grew to $11 trillion in 2023, up from $242 billion in 2010, according to the latest EY Global Alternative Fund Survey. That’s largely due to an ongoing generational wealth transfer, said Jun Li, who heads global and Americas wealth and asset management at EY. One estimate suggests that $84 trillion in assets could change hands over the next 20 years. Recent research by consultancy Bain & Co. projects that private market assets under management will jump to as much as $65 trillion by 2032 — growing at more than twice the rate of public assets. Michael Weisz, co-founder and CEO of the private markets investment platform Yieldstreet, said the recent uptick in activity is just the tip of the iceberg. “I think for the next five to seven years, the private markets are going to accelerate,” he said. Another key to the private markets boom is that investors, including institutional portfolio and asset managers, are hedging against public market concentration and volatility by investing in private funds, Li said. The growth in private investment is giving rise to even more valuable private companies: Some 87% of firms with revenues of $100 million or more are private, according to S&P Capital IQ (SPGI+1.30%). That means private markets represent a growing and increasingly lucrative opportunity. “If I’m an investor and I want to hitch a ride on economic growth... and I’m not doing private [companies], I’m missing out on a huge piece of the economy,” said Gaviser, of Morgan Stanley. With a significant portion of AI development happening at private companies, investors are being drawn to private markets — and then staying there, Gaviser said. “While AI has been the big story of this year, I think it’s a catalyst for private markets to continue to grow interest in the space,” he said. “We have people coming to us all the time saying, ‘Well, what else is there for me to do?’” One of the most important investing rules is to keep a diversified portfolio. Next year, Gaviser expects to see “a broadening out of private market activity generally, where the deal flow is not going to be as concentrated in a few sectors.” “We’re looking at deals all over the map,” he said. Outside of tech, areas such as consumer goods, real estate, hospitality, and healthcare are already seeing a pickup in activity, Gaviser said. Private credit will also continue to be a “hot asset class” in 2025, Yieldstreet’s Weisz said, in addition to private equity and real estate given that asset prices remain attractive. The number of public companies in the U.S. has shrunk from more than 7,000 at its peak in the late 1990s and early 2000s, to less than 4,000 today. In that same period, the number of private companies has ballooned to more than 25 million. That’s partly because companies are staying private for longer. As of 2022, the median age of a company before going public was 12 years, according to one study. That’s at least double what it was in 1980. (Gaviser puts the figure closer to 14 years now.) To keep up with the rapid pace of growth, major Wall Street firms and asset managers are expanding their offerings to snag a slice of the private market pie. Morgan Stanley launched its private markets transaction desk in March. It’s designed to help clients looking to buy and sell private company shares. BlackRock (BLK+1.46%) made three major private market acquisitions this year, including plans to buy private credit firm HPS Investment Partners for about $12 billion earlier this month. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said the deal will grow the firm’s private market client assets to more than $410 billion, and is a recognition of the growing demand among investors for access to private equity. “Private markets are no longer a separate or a standalone exposure for our investors,” Fink said in a call with analysts earlier this month. “The blending of public and private in today’s reality is a part of the entire market of today.” In September, Citigroup announced a $25 billion private credit and direct lending program in partnership with Apollo (APO+1.88%), which will allow Citi’s (C+1.76%) large banking client base to tap into burgeoning private markets. In the “last couple of years you saw the private market advantaged,” Citi CEO Jane Fraser told Bloomberg last month. “The goal here from our perspective, give the client as much choice as possible.” Some on Wall Street are more skeptical about the shift toward private markets. JPMorgan Chase (JPM+1.64%) CEO Jamie Dimon has repeatedly questioned whether the rise in private companies is good for investors and markets. “Private markets have grown dramatically, and they don’t have the same transparency and liquidity and research,” Dimon said in September at the Council of Institutional Investors conference. “You may think that’s a good thing, and there are good attributes, so it’s not a criticism, but is that what you want?” As asset managers try to woo retail investors and newer entrants into private markets, startups could feel pressure to increase the frequency and accessibility of financial reporting, said EY’s Li. “Some of that is going to be really led by the retail investors getting access to private markets products,” he said. “I think that on its own is going to require a lot more transparency, just from a customer experience and reporting perspective.” Tender offers have also become a driver of private markets activity this year. Tender offers allow stockholders in a private company to sell some or all of their shares, either to another investor or back to the company itself. It’s a way for private firms to both raise cash and reward employees. Tender activity climbed 44% year-over-year in the third quarter, according to data released by software platform Carta earlier this month. Jamie Hutchinson, a partner in the private equity group at Goodwin, told Carta that the market for tender offers is busier than he’s ever seen. OpenAI has reportedly given employees the chance to sell roughly $1.5 billion worth of shares to Japan’s SoftBank Group (SFTBY-0.61%). Employees have until Christmas Eve to decide whether to participate, according to CNBC. That comes on the heels of a $6.6 billion funding round that valued the ChatGPT maker at $157 billion, making it the second-most valuable private company in the world, behind TikTok parent ByteDance. But as private companies get bigger — especially companies with massive demand for their products — going public ultimately provides more permanent access to capital, said Gaviser, of Morgan Stanley. “Once you get to be a certain size, the public markets do a better job than the private markets do,” he said. “If you look at some of these tenders out there, they’re a fraction of the value of the company.” History offers some guidance when it comes to the 2025 market. After the 2008 financial crisis, a rise in tender offers set the stage for an upswing in initial public offerings, Hutchinson said. He expects a similar dynamic next year. “I think there’s a direct correlation between tenders and IPOs,” he said. “If history repeats itself — which it tends to — this moment of time tells us that a year to a year and a half from now, we will be seeing an increase in IPOs.” Morgan Stanley CEO Ted Pick said on a call with analysts in October that while private markets are booming, there is pent-up demand for IPOs that will likely begin to unravel next year. “There are a whole bunch of great companies that are owned privately that do want to make their way into the public markets,” Pick said. “I think we’re going to see the IPO market slowly work its way back, larger names coming to market.” At Yieldstreet, Weisz sees growing investor confidence in the direction of the market, the U.S. economy, and risk-taking in investing that could help fuel another year of healthy returns. “That’s going to drive a bullish economy,” he said, “both in terms of the public market and the private markets.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Heavy Equipment and Industrial Machinery Stocks to Buy. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Deere & Company (NYSE:DE) stands against the other heavy equipment and industrial machinery stocks. The industrial heavy equipment market includes machinery and tools used in construction, mining, agriculture, and industrial applications. According to 360iResearch, this sector is critically important for infrastructure development, mining operations, and large-scale agricultural productivity. Growing infrastructural developments, rapid urbanization, and the growth of mining activities are fueling the necessity for heavy equipment. In agriculture, improved machinery efficiency remains critical for meeting global food demands. As per 360iResearch, market growth continues to be influenced by technological advancements like automation, loT integration, and sustainability trends focusing on fuel-efficient and electrically powered machinery. Research Nester believes that the autonomous heavy equipment market was worth more than US$11.43 million in 2024 and should surpass US$26.56 million by 2037. The primary growth driver for the rapid expansion is the strong growth projected in the construction industry. The growth in the building and construction industry is aligned with the demand for heavy equipment. Market experts opine that growth in the construction industry is expected to stem from lower interest rates in 2025. The types of heavy equipment that are used in the construction industry include earthmoving equipment, and material construction industry, among others. READ ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In. As per Stumble Forward, the industrial machinery landscape has been witnessing a massive transformation. Technological advancements are taking place at a rapid pace, with manufacturers adopting cutting-edge tools and processes to beat the competition. Increased automation and robotics, Al integration, green manufacturing, and 3D printing for customization are the key trends likely to drive growth for the industrial machinery industry in 2025. Automation in industrial machinery tends to reduce the chances of human error and supports streamlining production. Robots, together with machine learning, are being employed to inspect, assemble, and even pack goods. Stumble Forward went on to add that Al-powered systems can predict equipment failures, reducing unexpected costly repairs. This predictive maintenance technology should continue to help industries save thousands of dollars in repair costs. In 2025, industrial machinery is expected to be designed in a way that will promote sustainability. Energy-efficient machines, including those running on renewable energy, or producing less waste, will be adopted. Finally, the adoption of 3D printing in industrial machinery, which can help produce parts that are lightweight yet incredibly strong, is expected to grow as manufacturers continue to realize its importance. Stumble Forward also added that the ability to print intricate designs should result in innovation, enabling engineers to test prototypes and adjust accordingly. Our Methodology To list the 10 Best Heavy Equipment and Industrial Machinery Stocks to Buy, we used a screener and sifted through online rankings. After getting a list of 25-30 stocks, we filtered out the ones having high hedge fund holdings. Finally, the stocks are arranged in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiments, as of Q3 2024. At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A combine harvesting crops, showing the capabilities of the company's agriculture equipment. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 41 Deere & Company (NYSE:DE) is a global leader in agricultural, construction, and forestry equipment manufacturing. As per Fortune Business Insights, the global agriculture equipment market size was valued at US$180.81 billion in 2023. This market is expected to grow from US$193.46 billion in 2024 to US$344.77 billion by 2032. These growth prospects offer a substantial opportunity for Deere & Company (NYSE:DE), mainly in lower- and middle-income countries, where agricultural practices are evolving rapidly. Moreover, Deere & Company (NYSE:DE)’s continued investment in precision agriculture technology places it well as an industry leader in innovation. With farming becoming increasingly data-driven and automated, the company’s advanced equipment and software solutions should become increasingly attractive to farmers looking to maximize efficiency and productivity. Moreover, the trend of farm consolidation continues to drive larger agricultural operations to invest significantly in advanced machinery. This should create a favorable environment for Deere & Company (NYSE:DE)’s offerings. Deere & Company (NYSE:DE)’s focus on developing integrated technology platforms that provide seamless connectivity and data analysis capabilities is expected to create a significant competitive advantage. By providing farmers with tools to optimize their operations, Deere & Company (NYSE:DE) might be able to command premium pricing and increase customer loyalty. This will ultimately lead to market share gains even in a competitive environment. Parnassus Investments, an investment management company, released the Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said: “Deere & Company (NYSE:DE) stock dropped after the company released underwhelming fiscal second-quarter earnings and lowered its 2024 guidance. Although the company is going through an equipment demand downturn, we believe it will demonstrate better-than-expected through-cycle performance.” Overall DE ranks 2nd on our list of the best heavy equipment and industrial machinery stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of DE as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than DE but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Wells Fargo Says It’s Quitting Climate-Banking Group

Wells Fargo & Co. said it’s leaving the world’s biggest climate alliance for banks, in the latest sign that Wall Street is breaking away from such groups. The company said in a statement Friday that it ended its membership in the Net-Zero Banking Alliance. The bank, based in San Francisco, didn’t provide an explanation for its decision. Wells Fargo’s departure follows Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which announced earlier this month that it was quitting NZBA. Financial companies have been under increasing pressure from Republican lawmakers, which have launched investigations and filed lawsuits related to the industry’s efforts to address climate change. The House Judiciary Committee, led by Ohio Republican Jim Jordan, said last week that it’s found “substantial evidence of collusion and anticompetitive behavior” by financial companies. Separately, BlackRock Inc., Vanguard Group Inc. and State Street Corp. have been sued by a group of states led by Texas for allegedly breaking antitrust laws by boosting electricity prices through their investments. In a report, Jordan’s committee specifically criticized financial environmental alliances, saying they have created what it calls “a climate cartel.” NZBA is part of the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, which was launched ahead of a key climate summit in Scotland in 2021. Back then, the world’s biggest lenders, including JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc., joined the coalition. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said in a statement that Wells Fargo’s withdrawal from NZBA was linked to his office’s review of the bank’s “status as a potential boycotter of energy companies.” “I urge other financial institutions to follow their example and end ESG (environmental, social and governance) policies that are hostile to our critical oil and gas industries” Paxton said. Wells Fargo’s decision was based on the company’s internal analysis, said a person familiar with the matter who declined to be identified. A spokesman for NZBA said in a statement that Wells Fargo’s departure was “based on its own individual circumstances.” He added that five banks have left the group since it started in 2021, while more than 100 have joined. NZBA’s member banks have made “significant progress” in setting net zero targets, he said. Wells Fargo is one of the largest financiers for the fossil-fuel industry. It ranks as the second-leading arranger of bonds and loans for oil, gas and coal companies since the start of the decade, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. JPMorgan is first. Banks and money managers have been defecting from other climate groups in increasing numbers amid GOP-led pressure. This month, Franklin Templeton said it was leaving Climate Action 100+, which was created to press high-polluting companies to curb their emissions. The investment firm two years ago hired Anne Simpson, who was the first chair of CA100+, as its global head of sustainability. (The NZBA is part of the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, which is co-chaired by Mark Carney, who is chair of Bloomberg Inc. and a former Bank of England governor, and Michael R.

Title: ‘I love kicking footballs’ – Andy Quinn follows his own star to pursue NFL goal
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/2024/12/14/i-love-kicking-footballs-andy-quinn-follows-his-own-star-to-pursue-nfl-goal/
Time Published: 2024-12-23T06:00:00Z
Full Content:
For a phenomenon that is only a few years old, the story risks becoming repetitive. An Irish lad who grew up playing a kicking sport realises he’s a naturally better ball-striker than Americans lacking the same GAA, rugby or soccer background. He has a go at kicking a pigskin. The ball flies off the boot. American colleges or sometimes even NFL franchises have their heads turned. For all the growing familiarity with Ireland’s newfound relationship with the gridiron, Andy Quinn’s story still stands out. The Creggs native was an outhalf at Blackrock College. He played at youth level for Connacht. While his Junior Cup year was disrupted by Covid, Quinn still might have pulled on the 10 jersey during a Senior Cup run. He gave it up. Instead, he finished school in England – if school is the right word. Quinn sat his Leaving Cert while attending the NFL Academy in Loughborough. In his own words, it was “Blackrock College but for American football, but then on steroids” – of the metaphorical, not literal kind. The move paid off. Quinn earned a scholarship to kick and punt at Boston College. His flight leaves in January. Next year, Boston College’s schedule includes dates with Michigan State, Cal Berkley, Clemson, Georgia Tech, Notre Dame and Stanford. Recruited as both a kicker and punter, Quinn is more likely to see early game time in the latter role. He may or may not become the next Irishman in the NFL after Dan Whelan, Jude McAtamney and Charlie Smyth, but he will get a degree. In recent years, the National Collegiate Athletics Association started allowing unpaid student athletes to finally take some share of the billions they generate as part of America’s obsession with college sports. Players can now profit off their name, image and likeness (NIL). On top of that, some schools will soon start sharing their revenue with players. One figure involved in college sports suggests that kickers and punters can earn anywhere from $50,000-$300,000 a year. Like plenty of us, Quinn needed something to keep him sane during the pandemic lockdowns. In true Irish outhalf fashion, he became “obsessed” with training his place kicking. Listening to him talk technique, he isn’t lying. “It was like a round of golf for me,” he explains. “I’d kick the balls in, kick them over the bar and then kick them back out. I’d do that for five or six hours, three or four times a week. Through that, my rugby kicking became quite good but I never knew it would transfer into another sport. “Anyone I was following on Instagram was to do with kicking a rugby ball and also gym work. My phone was clogged up with videos of me kicking. After doing it for a while, it was pretty obvious to me that if I missed and it went left, I didn’t have a strong enough follow through. I always found that it was my foot contact and follow through that were the determining factors if the ball went over the bar or not.” Originally from Creggs on the Roscommon-Galway border (Quinn supports Galway, for what it’s worth), he went down the Caelan Doris route of moving from out west to board at Blackrock. Aged 15, Connacht started taking notice. He didn’t always line out at outhalf. Listed at 6ft 4ins, a growth spurt one summer left Quinn close to that height at an early enough stage. Blackrock took one look at him and stuck him in the second row as a lineout jumper. While there’s a bit of muscle on the frame now, he’s no Joe McCarthy. Had Quinn stuck at rugby and progressed through the system, Sam Prendergast wouldn’t have been the only outhalf being asked questions about his slight frame. “It helped a lot because I was skinny so they could throw me up in the lineout, literally fire me up,” says Quinn, laughing. “I was flying for a little bit. I was playing secondrow for Blackrock College, then for my club team Buccaneers I was playing outhalf. I was still kicking.” The summer before his fifth year at school, Quinn found Tadhg Leader, another former rugby player who is driving Ireland’s burgeoning American football involvement. Leader set up a competition, Ireland’s Kicking King. Quinn won it by landing field goals during the half-time break of a college game at the Aviva Stadium. Two days later, he was back at school on the Rock Road. The NFL Academy needed a kicker. They were impressed that Quinn, aged 16 at the time, could land 45-yard field goals in front of a big crowd at Lansdowne Road only shortly after taking up the sport. Or so the story goes. “That’s what the NFL Academy coaches told me, so I’m gonna go with that,” jokes Quinn. “I was there for one year, my whole year in sixth year. I had to study the Leaving Cert on my own. I didn’t go to any classes, I was in Loughborough and I did all my study in my dorm room and I got some help from the academic adviser. I had some grinds, but I was mainly looking at the books and teaching myself the Leaving Cert curriculum. “We had a few hiccups along the way. I couldn’t complete the PE project and the Ag Science project because I was an external candidate. At Easter time, I had to pick up business. I had six weeks to learn the whole course, I hadn’t done it for the Junior Cert. For some reason I decided to do higher level but I got a H4 so I’ll take that.” The non-sporting aspects of Quinn’s story also stand out. When he first answered the phone for this article, he apologised for sounding flustered. Quinn had just rushed back from a morning’s work. The NIL money isn’t on its way yet. He works with a child with an intellectual disability, accompanying him on the bus to school. “I sit in the back with him, make sure he puts on his seat belt. I keep him engaged, make sure he doesn’t open doors.” The job came up primarily because of a familiarity with disability. Quinn’s younger brother has 22q, a deletion of DNA on his 22nd chromosome. Aged 10, Andy learned sign language so the pair could communicate. Since gaining some notoriety for his kicking, Quinn has pushed to raise more awareness of the condition. Another brother – there are four young Quinn lads – was previously diagnosed with benign leukaemia. He underwent chemotherapy treatment during the pandemic. Everyone who leaves on the boat grapples with varying degrees of sadness, guilt and early onset homesickness, but for a family which has gone through some hardship, it must be particularly difficult for the eldest child to go. “My grand uncle, he emigrated to America when his youngest brother was 10,” says Quinn. “I was talking to them recently and they said they never really got to know each other that much. It’s on my mind to keep in contact with my brothers, because they are so young. “I spent seven weeks over in America this summer and when I came back, I didn’t tell my younger brothers I was coming. For the first time ever they were happy to see me.” One last question remains. Quinn was on the Junior Cup panel in 2021. He may well have featured in the Senior Cup, a more familiar path to professional sport than an academy in Loughborough. You don’t need to read Ross O’Carroll-Kelly to know that, for schools like this, rugby is everything. Especially if you play 10. “Why did I leave rugby? The opportunity,” says Quinn. “Making any sort of money in American football or rugby is a bit of a long shot anyway, so I thought I’d rather get to see more parts of the world and do something which I really enjoy, which is kicking. “I love kicking footballs. When I played rugby, it was to get the conversion after the try or to get a 50/22. That’s why I played.” Back home in Creggs, there is a stream outside Quinn’s house which represents the border between two counties. “You can’t really say whether I’m from Roscommon or Galway because you’ll offend some people,” he says, again laughing. Winning a Senior Cup or lining out for Connacht may well have sparked an intercounty battle to claim Quinn as their own. Once he’s launching footballs into the Massachusetts sky, and potentially beyond, those debates will linger for a while yet. © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

The Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 1.18% to 42,840.26 points; the S&P 500 was up 1.09% to 5930.85; and the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.03% to 19,572.6. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, believes the Magnificent Seven technology stocks will continue to dominate the United States market next year. The artificial intelligence mega forces driving investment will push up Nvidia, Alphabet (Google), Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple and Tesla, which combined make up a third of the S&P 500 market capitalisation. Following the election of US President Donald Trump, there should be less regulation and lower taxes, resulting in higher corporate earnings in a higher growth environment, said BlackRock. But it was cautious about any surge in long-term bond yields and an escalation in trade protectionism. Across the Tasman, the S&P/ASX 200 Index had risen 1.55% to 8192.4 points at 6pm NZ time, no doubt exhilarated by the A$3.4 billion (NZ$3.76b) purchase of Foxtel by the London-based sports streaming platform DAZN. Previous owners News Corp and Telstra will take stakes of 6% and 3% respectively in DAZN, with shareholder loans to Foxtel of A$578m being repaid. Paul Robertshawe, chief investment officer with Octagon Asset Management, said the purchase implied that Sky TV “is pretty cheap and it may prompt talk about someone wanting to buy Sky”. Sky TV, up 8c or 3% to $2.75, has a content-sharing agreement with Foxtel. Robertshaw said the local market had a big finish on Friday and volumes and information flow are now lighter as it heads to the end of the year. Contact, likely to join the MSCI World Index at the expense of Mercury, increased 33c or 3.76% to $9.11.
