Photo / NZ Herald The New Zealand sharemarket had a weak start to the year with the benchmark S&P/NZX 50 falling in light trading. The index closed down 0.33% at 13,067.83, a drop of 42.91 points on trading of 21.78 million shares worth $93.47 million. There were 52 decliners and 90 gainers on the main board. Shane Solly, portfolio manager with Harbour Asset Management, said the market was weak after a slightly weaker United States market overnight. “The volume isn’t very high and so the difference between today and the last day of last year is more ups than downs today, and so we’ve seen a bit of reversion.” Solly said some of the stocks that had a strong 2024 had given back a bit of that performance today. “We’re seeing the market down on weakness from things like Fisher & Paykel Healthcare, Auckland Airport, Infratil and Mainfreight. “There’s just a bit of profit taking there.” Shares in Fisher & Paykel fell 1.04% or 40c to $38, while Auckland Airport was down 1.95% or 17c to $8.53. Infratil declined 1.87% or 23.5c to $12.365 and Mainfreight ended the day a touch lower, dropping 1c to $73.49. Solly said people were taking a more cautious wait-and-see approach. Long-term bond yields, the 10-year government bond yields, had been tracking higher off the back of question marks around what the incoming US President Donald Trump might do. Solly expected the market to continue to be quiet next week with many people still away on holiday but there could be updates from some retail companies in late January which will reveal how the Christmas shopping period went for them. Retail spending data showed while Boxing Day had been strong, activity was weaker in the lead-up to Christmas. Some property stocks had a bit of a bounce and BlackRock had sold some of its shares in Kiwi Property Group, reducing its stake from 5.334% to 4.981%. Kiwi Property shares rose 1.11% or 1c to 91c, Precinct Properties was up 2.97% or 3.5c to $1.215 and Argosy Property climbed 1.5% or 1.5c to $1.015. One area Solly was keeping an eye on was the Chinese sharemarket which had a weak day on Thursday. Investors were hoping for more stimulus to come. “We need the Chinese economy to be at least stabilising for some of our exporters. It’s probably had the weakest start [to the year] for some time. And so there’s a bit of weariness about that.” Blis Technologies, Sky Network Television and Pacific Edge saw the biggest percentage jumps in their share prices. Blis rose 6.67% or 0.001c to 1.6c, Sky was up 5.77% or 15c to 2.75 and Pacific Edge climbed 5.6% or 0.007c to 13.2c. General Capital, Promisia Healthcare and Eroad saw the biggest percentage declines. Eroad was down 5.31% or 6c to $1.07. Wall Street stocks opened 2025 on a tepid note falling modestly as markets await a heavier news flow later in January. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended down 0.4% at 42,392.27. The broad-based S&P 500 dipped 0.2% to 5868.55, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index also declined 0.2% to 19,280.79. - additional reporting AFP Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read.

Title: Read Between the Lies: A Pattern Recognition Guide

Time Published: 2025-01-03T03:33:51Z

EditorEconomy Brownstone Institute, josh stylman Josh Stylman Brownstone Institute When Avril Haines, Director of National Intelligence, announced during Event 201’s pandemic drill in 2019 that they would “flood the zone with trusted sources,” few understood this preview of coordinated narrative control. Within months, we watched it unfold in real time—unified messaging across all platforms, suppression of dissent, and coordinated narrative control that fooled much of the world. But not everyone stayed fooled forever. Some saw through it immediately, questioning every aspect from day one. Others thought it was just incompetent government trying to protect us. Many initially accepted the precautionary principle—better safe than sorry. But as each policy failure pointed in the same direction—toward more control and less human agency—the pattern became impossible to ignore. Anyone not completely subsumed by the system eventually had to confront its true purpose: not protecting health or safety, but expanding control. Once you recognize this pattern of deception, two questions should immediately arise whenever major stories dominate headlines: “What are they lying about?” and “What are they distracting us from?” The pattern of coordinated deception becomes unmistakable. Consider how media outlets spent three years pushing Russiagate conspiracies, driving unprecedented social division while laying the groundwork for what would become the greatest psychological operation in history. Today, while the media floods us with Ukraine coverage, BlackRock positions itself to profit from both the destruction and reconstruction. The pattern becomes unmistakable once you see it—manufactured crises driving pre-planned “solutions” that always expand institutional control. Mainstream media operates on twin deceptions: misdirection and manipulation. The same anchors who sold us WMDs in Iraq, promoted “Russia collusion,” and insisted Hunter Biden’s laptop was “Russian disinformation” still occupy prime time slots. Just as we see with RFK, Jr.’s HHS nomination, the pattern is consistent: coordinated attacks replace substantive debate, identical talking points appear across networks, and legitimate questions are dismissed through character assassination rather than evidence. Being consistently wrong isn’t a bug—it’s a feature. Their role isn’t to inform but to manufacture consent. The template is consistent: Saturate media with emotional spectacles while advancing institutional agendas with minimal scrutiny. Like learning to spot a fake smile or hearing a false note in music, you develop an instinct for the timing: Money and Power: Medical Control: Digital Control: As these deceptions become more obvious, different forms of resistance emerge. The truth-seeking takes different forms. Some become deep experts in specific deceptions—documenting early treatment successes with repurposed drugs, uncovering hospital protocol failures, or exploring the impact of vaccine injuries. Others develop a broader lens for seeing how narratives themselves are engineered. Walter Kirn’s brilliant pattern recognition cuts to the heart of our manufactured reality. His tweets dissecting the United CEO murder coverage expose how even violent crimes are now packaged as entertainment spectacles, complete with character arcs and narrative twists. Kirn’s insight highlights a critical dimension of media control: by turning every crisis into an entertainment narrative, they divert attention from deeper questions. Instead of asking why institutional safeguards fail or who benefits, audiences become captivated by carefully scripted outrage. This deliberate distraction ensures that institutional agendas move forward without scrutiny. His insight reveals how entertainment packaging serves the broader control system. While each investigation requires its own expertise, this pattern of narrative manipulation connects to a larger grid of deception. As I’ve explored in “The Information Factory” and “Engineering Reality,” everything from education to medicine to currency itself has been captured by systems designed to shape not just our choices, but our very perception of reality. Most revealing is what they don’t cover. Notice how quickly stories disappear when they threaten institutional interests. Remember the Epstein client list? The Maui land grab? The mounting vaccine injuries? The silence speaks volumes. Consider the recent whistleblower testimonies revealing suppressed safety concerns at Boeing, a company long entangled with regulatory agencies and government contracts. Two whistleblowers—both former employees who raised alarms about safety issues—died under suspicious circumstances. Coverage of their deaths disappeared almost overnight, despite the profound implications for public safety and corporate accountability. This pattern repeats in countless cases where accountability would disrupt entrenched power structures, leaving crucial questions unanswered and narratives tightly controlled. These decisions aren’t accidental—they result from media ownership, advertiser influence, and government pressure, ensuring the narrative remains tightly controlled. But perhaps most striking isn’t the media’s deception itself, but how thoroughly it shapes its consumers’ reality. Watch how confidently they repeat phrases clearly engineered in think tanks. Listen as they parrot talking points with religious conviction: “January 6th was worse than 9/11,” “Trust The Science™,” “Democracy is on the ballot” and, perhaps the most consequential lie in modern history, “Safe and Effective.” The professional-managerial class proves especially susceptible to this programming. Their expertise becomes a prison of status—the more they’ve invested in institutional approval, the more fervently they defend institutional narratives. Watch how quickly a doctor who questions vaccine safety loses his license, how swiftly a professor questioning gender ideology faces review, how rapidly a journalist stepping out of line gets blacklisted. The system ensures compliance through economic capture: your mortgage becomes your leash, your professional status your prison guard. The same lawyers who prides themselves on critical thinking will aggressively shut down any questioning of official narratives. The professor who teaches “questioning power structures” becomes apoplectic when students question pharmaceutical companies. The circular validation makes the programming nearly impenetrable: This self-reinforcing system forms a perfect closed loop: Each component validates the others while excluding outside information. Try finding the entry point for actual truth in this closed system. The professional class’s pride in their critical thinking becomes darkly ironic—they’ve simply outsourced their opinions to “authoritative sources.” Most disturbing is how willingly they’ve surrendered their sovereignty. Watch them defer: Their empathy becomes a weapon used against them. Question lockdowns? You’re killing grandma. Doubt transition surgery for minors? You’re causing suicides. Resist equity initiatives? You’re perpetuating oppression. The programming works by making resistance feel like cruelty. Something remarkable is happening beneath the surface noise: a genuine awakening that defies traditional political boundaries. You see it in the subtle exchanges between colleagues when official narratives strain credibility. In the growing silence at dinner parties as propaganda talking points fall flat. In the knowing looks between strangers when public health theatre reaches new heights of absurdity. This isn’t a movement in the traditional sense—it can’t be, since traditional movement structures are vulnerable to infiltration, subversion, and capture. Instead, it’s more like a spontaneous emergence of pattern recognition. A distributed awakening without central leadership or formal organization. Those who see through the patterns recognize the mass formation for what it is, while its subjects project their own programming onto others, dismissing pattern recognition as “conspiracy theories,” “anti-science,” or other reflexive labels designed to prevent genuine examination. The hardest truth isn’t recognizing the programming—it’s confronting what it means for human consciousness and society itself. We’re watching real-time evidence that most human minds can be captured and redirected through sophisticated psychological operations. Their thoughts aren’t their own, yet they’d die defending what they’ve been programmed to believe. This isn’t just media criticism anymore—it’s an existential question about human consciousness and free will. What does it mean when a species’ capacity for independent thought can be so thoroughly hijacked? When natural empathy and moral instincts become weapons of control? When education and expertise actually decrease resistance to programming? The programming works because it hijacks core human drives: Each natural human trait becomes a vulnerability to be exploited. The most educated become the most programmable because their status addiction runs deepest. Their “critical thinking” becomes a script running on corrupted hardware. This is the core challenge of our time: Can human consciousness evolve faster than the systems designed to hijack it? Can pattern recognition and awareness spread faster than manufactured consensus? Can enough people learn to read between the lies before the programming becomes complete? The stakes could not be higher. This isn’t just about politics or media literacy—it’s about the future of human consciousness itself. Whether our species maintains the capacity for independent thought may depend on those who can still access it helping others break free from the spell. The matrix of control deepens daily, but so does the awakening. The question is: Which spreads faster—the programming or the awareness of it? Our future as a species may depend on the answer.

Title: Frax Partners With Securitize on New Stablecoin
URL: https://www.pymnts.com/cryptocurrency/2025/frax-partners-with-securitize-on-new-stablecoin/
Time Published: 2025-01-03T00:54:40Z

Decentralized stablecoin cryptocurrency protocol Frax Finance launched a stablecoin that it said offers “unprecedented” transparency and custody. The frxUSD stablecoin is a rebranded evolution of the company’s flagship FRAX stablecoin and will leverage BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), tokenized by Securitize, Frax said in a Thursday (Jan. 2) press release. The new stablecoin offers direct fiat redemption capabilities and enhanced compliance with U.S. financial systems, according to the release. “By partnering with Securitize to access and leverage BlackRock’s BUIDL Fund we are setting a new standard for stablecoins,” Frax Finance Founder Sam Kazemian said in the release. “frxUSD combines the transparency and programmability of blockchain technology with the trust and stability of BlackRock’s prime treasury offerings.” In this new collaboration around the stablecoin, BUIDL will become an enshrined custodian asset for minting and redeeming frxUSD; the stablecoin will be backed by cash, U.S. Treasury bills and repurchase agreements held in BUIDL; and frxUSD will offer seamless fiat on/off-ramping capabilities via the BUIDL infrastructure, per the release. “Tokenized real-world assets provide an excellent bridge between traditional finance and decentralized finance, bringing institutional-grade investments on-chain with unprecedented transparency and efficiency,” Securitize Co-Founder and CEO Carlos Domingo said in the release. “This collaboration exemplifies the next stage in financial evolution, demonstrating how traditional and decentralized systems can work together to redefine asset management strategies.” Stablecoins are emerging as a powerful tool bridging the gap between traditional financial technology and the world of cryptocurrencies, PYMNTS reported in October. As cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value by being pegged to a reserve asset (usually a fiat currency like the U.S. dollar or the euro), stablecoins are able to offer the efficiency and transparency of blockchain technology while providing the familiarity and stability of fiat currencies. In another, separate development, it was reported Thursday that stablecoin leader Tether has seen its market value decline amid new European Union (EU) cryptocurrency rules, with the company’s USDT having its sharpest weekly drop in two years. USDT had reached a record market value in mid-December but declined after several EU-based exchanges and Coinbase removed the stablecoin due to compliance issues with the EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation that took full effect on Dec. 30. We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

Title: Morgan Stanley Is Latest Bank to Exit UN-backed Climate Group

Morgan Stanley became the latest major bank to quit the U.N.-backed Net-Zero Banking Alliance. On Jan. 2, the New York-based financial services company said it had “decided to withdraw” from the voluntary climate pact sponsored by the U.N. Environment Programme Finance Initiative. In a statement, Morgan Stanley said its “commitment to net-zero remains unchanged.” “We aim to contribute to real-economy decarbonization by providing our clients with the advice and capital required to transform business models and reduce carbon intensity,” the company said in a statement. “We will continue to report on our progress as we work towards our 2030 interim financed emissions targets.” Representatives of Morgan Stanley did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Epoch Times. Net zero is a term for the practice of balancing greenhouse gas emissions with the amount taken out of the atmosphere. Morgan Stanley has published an environmental and social policy statement. The document, most recently updated in September 2024, says the company considers emissions when financing projects related to the generation of electricity as well as to oil and gas exploration and development. “Our approach to managing climate risks, including transition risks and physical risks, and pursuing transition finance opportunities is informed by our climate strategy and overall goal of achieving net-zero financed emissions by 2050,” it said in the document. On its website, the Net-Zero Banking Alliance calls itself a “group of leading global banks committed to aligning their lending, investment, and capital markets activities with net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.” In its most recent annual progress report, published in October 2024, the group said its membership has grown to 144 banks since its founding in April 2021. Representatives of the alliance declined to comment on the Morgan Stanley decision. With its Thursday decision, Morgan Stanley joined a rash of U.S. banks that have departed the alliance within the past month. On Dec. 31, Citigroup and Bank of America said they were leaving the alliance. Those exits followed the December exit of Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs. In November, 11 state attorneys general, led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, filed an anti-trust suit against BlackRock, Vanguard Group, and State Street Corp. In a statement released on Nov. 27, Paxton said the three companies “formed a cartel to rig the coal market, artificially reduce the energy supply, and raise prices.” The three companies weaponized influence from their stock holdings to pressure coal companies to accommodate “green energy” goals and reduce coal output by more than half by 2030, Paxton’s statement said.

Title: FBI Claims to Disrupt Florida Plot to Attack Pro-Israel Organization

The FBI filed court documents this week accusing Gainesville, Florida, resident Forrest Kendall Pemberton of plotting to attack the South Florida offices of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) with multiple firearms. Pemberton, 26, was reported missing by his father on December 23. His father, unnamed in police reports, told the Gainesville police department he received a text message from Pemberton advising him to look in the backpack he left in his bedroom. The backpack proved to contain a “concerning” note that “espoused anti-authority sentiments” and looked disturbingly like a farewell message. Pemberton’s father added that his son had previously “espoused antisemitic views.” Pemberton’s father said the search history in his son’s browser included various government offices and prominent entities, such as the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the Social Security Administration (SSA), Blackrock, the World Economic Forum (WEF), and AIPAC. Pemberton’s searches also included information on various assassination methods, including the use of poisons and vehicles as weapons. Most disturbingly under the circumstances, Pemberton owned several firearms, including two rifles and a pistol, which were missing from his room. His father thought he might have been planning an assault similar to the December 4 murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. Everything We Know About Dual New Years Terror Attacks with Joel Pollak Police investigators tracked Pemberton down to a motel in Plantation, Florida, where his browser history indicated he had researched the location of an AIPAC office. AIPAC relocated its office some time ago, but Google Maps still pointed to the old address. The police learned that Pemberton stayed at the motel in Plantation for only one day, checking out on December 24 and resurfacing in Tallahassee, where he employed ride-sharing service Uber to get from an auto shop to a Red Roof Inn. The FBI kept the hotel under surveillance and intercepted Pemberton when he was getting into another rideshare vehicle. He was carrying all three of his firearms when he was intercepted on December 25, which in 2024 was both Christmas Day and the first day of Hanukkah. Pemberton told investigators he was using rideshares because his original plan had involved walking from Gainesville to nearby Ocala, where he purchased a very cheap Ford F-150 truck he apparently intended to use in a criminal assault. The F-150 apparently gave him some trouble on the road to Tallahassee. In its affidavit to prosecutors, the FBI said Pemberton targeted AIPAC because of its “political influence” and his “frustration with the status quo.” Asked if he was planning a suicide attack, he said he had not settled on the “suicide” part yet. “Um, I really don’t know if I was gonna end it with my life or not. I hadn’t gotten that far yet. It entirely depended if I ended up getting caught or not. If caught, that was a way out,” he said. “It would have been a one-way ticket. In Plantation, I decided I wasn’t ready. I gave up,” he said. The FBI affidavit was vague about exactly what Pemberton was doing in Tallahassee, which is on the opposite side of the huge Florida peninsula from Plantation, requiring at least seven hours of driving time. The most efficient route between the two cities would have taken Pemberton through his hometown of Gainesville. Tallahassee is the state capital, so it is possible Pemberton was contemplating another target after canceling his alleged plan to attack AIPAC in Plantation. AIPAC was not mentioned by name in the affidavit, being described only as an organization dedicated to “pro-Israel policies that strengthen and expand the U.S.-Israel relationship,” but AIPAC confirmed it was the intended target in a statement on Tuesday. “We will not be deterred by extremists in pursuing our mission to strengthen the relationship with America’s valued ally, Israel. We are deeply appreciative of the FBI’s work to stop this individual,” AIPAC said. The Department of Justice (DoJ) charged Pemberton with stalking on Monday, and contended he was scouting AIPAC offices with the intent of “killing, injuring, harassing, and intimidating” members of the organization. Pemberton’s case is scheduled for a hearing on Monday at the U.S. Courthouse in Gainesville. Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting. Copyright © 2025 Breitbart

Each Fund's estimated sources of the distributions paid as of December 23, 2024 and for its current fiscal year are as follows: Estimated Allocations as of December 23, 2024 Fund Distribution Net Income Net Realized Short-Term Gains Net Realized Long-Term Gains Return of Capital BCX1 $0.069700 $0.006437 (9%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0.063263 (91%) BDJ $0.061900 $0.011174 (18%) $0 (0%) $0.050726 (82%) $0 (0%) BGR1 $0.097300 $0.024526 (25%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0.072774 (75%) BGY $0.042600 $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0.042600 (100%) $0 (0%) BME1 $0.262100 $0.011681 (4%) $0 (0%) $0.250419 (96%) $0 (0%) BMEZ1 $0.178090 $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0.178090 (100%) BOE1 $0.082700 $0.013284 (16%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0.069416 (84%) BUI1 $0.136000 $0.036254 (27%) $0 (0%) $0.099746 (73%) $0 (0%) CII $0.141000 $0.003706 (3%) $0 (0%) $0.137294 (97%) $0 (0%) BST1 $0.250000 $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0.250000 (100%) $0 (0%) BSTZ1 $0.218000 $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0.218000 (100%) $0 (0%) BIGZ1 $0.086760 $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0.086760 (100%) BCAT1 $0.289190 $0.039645 (14%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0.249545 (86%) ECAT1 $0.306840 $0.032243 (11%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0.274597 (89%) Estimated Allocations for the Fiscal Year through December 23, 2024 Fund Distribution Net Income Net Realized Short-Term Gains Net Realized Long-Term Gains Return of Capital BCX1 $0.639500 $0.228555 (36%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0.410945 (64%) BDJ $0.680100 $0.360710 (53%) $0 (0%) $0.319390 (47%) $0 (0%) BGR1 $0.839400 $0.347383 (41%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0.492017 (59%) BGY $0.414400 $0.089746 (22%) $0.061249 (14%) $0.263405 (64%) $0 (0%) BME1 $2.605100 $0.077993 (3%) $0 (0%) $1.902998 (73%) $0.624109 (24%) BMEZ1 $1.691050 $0.025970 (2%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $1.665080 (98%) BOE1 $0.775700 $0.194338 (25%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0.581362 (75%) BUI1 $1.467000 $0.295618 (20%) $0 (0%) $0.889886 (61%) $0.281496 (19%) CII $1.235500 $0.064773 (5%) $0 (0%) $1.170727 (95%) $0 (0%) BST1 $3.000000 $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $2.981387 (99%) $0.018613 (1%) BSTZ1 $2.019010 $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $1.117905 (55%) $0.901105 (45%) BIGZ1 $0.833900 $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $0.833900 (100%) BCAT1 $2.648240 $0.284398 (11%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $2.363842 (89%) ECAT1 $2.860890 $0.195681 (7%) $0 (0%) $0 (0%) $2.665209 (93%) 1The Fund estimates that it has distributed more than its income and net-realized capital gains in the current fiscal year; therefore, a portion of your distribution may be a return of capital. A return of capital may occur, for example, when some or all of the shareholder's investment is paid back to the shareholder. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect the Fund's investment performance and should not be confused with ˜yield' or ˜income'. When distributions exceed total return performance, the difference will reduce the Fund's net asset value per share. The amounts and sources of distributions reported are only estimates and are being provided to you pursuant to regulatory requirements and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon each Fund's investment experience during the remainder of its fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. The Fund will send you a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year that will tell you how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes.

(NYSE: BKT) and BlackRock Taxable Municipal Bond Trust (NYSE: BBN) have adopted a Plan to support a level monthly distribution of income, capital gains and/or return of capital. The fixed amounts distributed per share are subject to change at the discretion of each Fund's Board of Directors/Trustees. Under its Plan, each Fund will distribute all available net income to its shareholders, consistent with its investment objectives and as required by the Code. If sufficient income (inclusive of net investment income and short-term capital gains) is not available on a monthly basis, a Fund will distribute long-term capital gains and/or return capital to its stockholders in order to maintain a level distribution. Each of the above-listed Funds is currently not relying on any exemptive relief from Section 19(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act). Each Fund expects that distributions under the Plan will exceed current income and capital gains and therefore will likely include a return of capital. Each Fund may make additional distributions from time to time, including additional capital gain distributions at the end of the taxable year, if required to meet requirements imposed by the Code and/or the 1940 Act.

Title: Bloomberg Highlights BlackRock’s Bitcoin Fund As The Greatest ETF Launch In History
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/bloomberg-highlights-blackrocks-bitcoin-fund/
Time Published: 2025-01-02T21:30:12Z
Full Content:
According to Bloomberg, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has set a new benchmark in the world of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) since its launch in January 2024. With over $50 billion in assets amassed in just 11 months, IBIT has achieved a feat unparalleled in the industry, outpacing traditional funds that have been operating for decades. BlackRock’s foray into the Bitcoin market has been a pivotal moment not only for BTC, but also for the broader cryptocurrency market. With over $11 trillion in assets under management, the firm’s endorsement has contributed to Bitcoin’s move beyond the $100,000 mark for the first time, ushering in a wave of institutional interest and attracting investors who were previously skeptical about the digital asset. However, the journey to establishing a spot-Bitcoin ETF in the United States has been fraught with challenges. The Winklevoss twins pioneered the effort in 2013, only to face repeated rejections from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Grayscale Investments, on the other hand, spearheaded a legal battle against the SEC, culminating in a crucial victory in 2023 when a federal appeals court overturned the agency’s prior rejection of its ETF application. As the landscape shifted, BlackRock’s entry, led by CEO Larry Fink—who had once disparaged Bitcoin—signaled a significant change in attitude within traditional finance. Once the SEC granted approval in January 2024, BlackRock and other firms such as Fidelity and VanEck successfully launched the first cohort of US ETFs investing directly in Bitcoin, collectively amassing around $107 billion in assets. Todd Sohn, managing director of ETF and technical strategy at Strategas Securities, highlighted that IBIT’s rapid growth eclipses the combined assets of more than 50 European-focused ETFs, many of which have been established for over 20 years. Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store, aptly described IBIT as “the greatest launch in ETF history.” Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart also noted that IBIT is the fastest ETF to reach significant milestones, further solidifying its status as a revolutionary product in the financial landscape. Amidst a growing spot Bitcoin ETF market, IBIT has distinguished itself with its rapid asset growth, reaching over $50 billion five times faster than the next closest fund, which took nearly four years. As it stands, IBIT has surpassed BlackRock’s gold ETF, the second-largest gold fund globally, despite significant inflows into that fund this year. The impact of IBIT on Bitcoin’s market dynamics is profound. The ETF has been instrumental in Bitcoin’s 118% price rally year-to-date, with IBIT accounting for over 50% of daily trading volume among Bitcoin ETFs. IBIT also made history by being the first Bitcoin ETF to offer options, which have quickly become some of the most traded contracts in the ETF market, averaging about $1.7 billion in daily notional volume. According to research from Asym500, other Bitcoin ETFs have struggled to achieve similar levels of trading activity, highlighting IBIT’s dominance. At the time of writing, the market’s leading crypto, BTC, is trading at $97,190, recording a gain of nearly 3% in the 24-hour time frame.

Title: MongoDB’s (MDB) Global Expansion: AI as the Key to Market Domination

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Top 10 AI Headlines Shaping Wall Street for 2025. In this article, we are going to take a look at where MongoDB, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDB) stands against the other AI stocks. As reported by Reuters, Wall Street’s major indexes started the final trading session of 2024 on a high note, continuing the two-year-long bull market. This was marked by economic recovery after the pandemic, hopes for lower interest rates, and excitement about the AI boom. All three major stock market indexes, the S&P 500, Dow, and Nasdaq, are near record highs and ready for their second consecutive year of gains. READ ALSO: 10 Buzzing AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings and 10 AI News Investors Shouldn’t Miss Despite an overall good year, late 2024 saw a pullback in artificial intelligence stocks. From profit-taking and investors locking in gains from the year's substantial rallies to concerns over high valuations and the Federal Reserve's cautious stance signaling fewer interest rate cuts in 2025, the sector was a bit “choppier” than usual these last few weeks. However, Wall Street analysts expect that the artificial intelligence sector will be in full gear in 2025, with a $2 trillion surge in AI-related capital expenditure over the next three years. Moreover, regulatory discussions around AI ethics and safety, spearheaded by global governments, are creating a supportive environment for innovation. "We believe tech stocks will be robust in 2025 on the shoulders of the AI Revolution and $2 trillion+ of incremental AI capex (spending) over the next 3 years”. According to Ives, tech stocks are anticipated to rise 25% in 2025 as Wall Street and investors deal with "a less regulatory spiderweb" under the administration of President-elect Donald Trump. He also believes that stronger artificial intelligence initiatives in the federal government should give the sector a boost. However, there may be "white-knuckle moments" in the year ahead over Federal Reserve decisions, uncertainty over U.S.-China tariffs, and concerns from critics who believe stock valuations are too high. "This will create the opportunities to own the tech theme and key names which has been our core investing tech playbook the last 2 years”. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A software engineer hosting a remote video training session on a multi-cloud database-as-a-service solution. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 49 MongoDB, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDB) provides a general-purpose database platform worldwide that integrates operational, unstructured, and AI-related data to streamline building applications. On December 18, Tigress Financial raised the firm’s price target on MongoDB to $430 from $400 and kept a “Strong Buy” rating on the shares. The analyst told investors in a research note that MongoDB will continue to see growing developer adoption and increasing momentum in its Atlas Database-as-a-Service platform. The Atlas Database-as-a-Service platform is a multi-cloud developer data platform that streamlines how you build with data. This increase is driven by burgeoning AI capabilities as the company continues to capture market share in the most critical and strategic areas of the enterprise software sector. The firm also said that the company’s ongoing AI integration and entry into new industries will lead to greater enterprise adoption, customer penetration, international expansion, and acceleration in Business Performance trends. Overall MDB ranks 7th on our list of the AI stocks that are shaping Wall Street for 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of MDB as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MDB but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Organic Food and Farming Stocks To Invest In. In this article, we are going to take a look at where General Mills, Inc. (NYSE:GIS) stands against the other organic food and farming stocks. Organic farming practices focus on using natural methods to cultivate crops, avoiding synthetic fertilizers and pesticides. This approach not only enhances the quality of food but also contributes to preserving biodiversity and maintaining healthy ecosystems. The organic food and farming sector provides economic benefits as well, creating jobs and supporting rural communities. The global organic food and farming industry has experienced significant growth in recent years, reflecting a shift in consumer preferences towards healthier and more sustainable food options. According to a report by The Business Research Company, the global organic food market was valued at $244.82 billion in 2023. The market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 15.1% during 2024-2028 to reach a value of $489.75 billion by the end of the forecast period. This growth is largely driven by increasing awareness of health benefits associated with organic products and a growing concern for environmental sustainability.

The 25th edition of the yearbook “The World of Organic Agriculture,” published by the Research Institute of Organic Agriculture (FiBL) and IFOAM – Organics International, highlights significant growth in the organic farming sector. Presented in February 2024 at the BIOFACH trade fair in Nuremberg, Germany, the report reveals that by the end of 2022, the area under organic management reached 96.4 million hectares. This marks an impressive increase of 26.6% or 20.3 million hectares compared to the previous year. Australia continues to lead the world in organic farming area, boasting 53 million hectares, an increase of 17.3 million hectares. The report shows that organic farming area increased across all continents, reflecting a global trend towards more sustainable agricultural practices. In terms of producers, the number of organic farmers worldwide rose to 4.5 million in 2022, which is nearly a 26% increase from 2021. Support for organic agriculture is gaining momentum globally, with many countries implementing action plans to promote organic farming practices. The number of fully implemented national regulations for organic agriculture rose to 75 in 2023, indicating a commitment to enhancing and regulating this sector. According to the report, the global organic market reached nearly EUR 135 billion in 2022. The United States was the largest market, valued at approximately EUR 56.6 billion, followed by Germany at EUR 15.3 billion and China at EUR 12.4 billion. While some European countries saw a decline in organic sales, Canada and the US experienced growth in retail sales, with increases of 9.7% and 4.4%, respectively. These figures indicate that consumer interest in organic products is strong, particularly in North America, where health consciousness is driving demand.

(Bloomberg) -- Purveyors of exchange-traded funds are finding ever more creative — and potentially riskier — ways to lure investors into the crypto craze. Most Read from Bloomberg Is This Weird Dome the Future of Watching Sports? NYPD Seeking Gunmen After 10 People Wounded Outside Queens Venue Detroit’s Michigan Central Is the Building Revival Story of 2024 Burned Out Parents Need Better Public Spaces A Commuting Resolution for 2025: Ride Your Local Subway or Bus Paperwork covering a plethora of newfangled offerings was filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission as 2024 was ending. Among the proposed products was an ETF from ProShares that would denominate the S&P 500’s return in Bitcoin. Funds planned by Strive Asset Management and REX Shares would offer exposure to convertible bonds issued by companies to buy Bitcoin. And ETF company Volatility Shares envisions getting inverse and leveraged Solana funds off the ground, alongside a vehicle that would track the sixth-largest digital token using futures contracts. “This is the continued evolution of launches to incorporate crypto strategies into ETFs. We’ll see a lot of these in 2025,” said Bloomberg Intelligence’s Athanasios Psarofagis. “It’s the hot thing — issuers love to strike when the theme is hot. We’ll see crypto everything.” All in all, the filings, if approved, would bring about more than a dozen new crypto-centric funds to the space in 2025, just a year after the inception of the first-ever US Bitcoin ETFs. 2024 was a banner year for all things crypto, which saw Bitcoin — the world’s largest digital asset — surge more than 120% to cross above $100,000. That boost happened thanks in part to incoming president Donald Trump’s embrace of the industry, with many market-watchers betting that a looser regulatory stance by his administration could help the crypto space grow further. The enthusiasm over his election helped push annual inflows for the biggest Bitcoin ETF — one by BlackRock — above $37 billion for the year, the third-most of all funds, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Bitcoin fan and MicroStrategy Inc. co-founder Michael Saylor also took advantage of surging crypto prices by doubling down on his tactic of purchasing the largest token for the company’s reserves. MicroStrategy has been using a mix of new equity and sales of convertible bonds to help finance the buying — and other companies have similar plans. According to a filing, the REX ETF intends to invest a majority of its assets in convertible bonds issued by firms that hold Bitcoin. Meanwhile, Strive is proposing to launch a fund that invests in derivatives such as swaps and options to get exposure to convertible securities issued by MicroStrategy or other companies with similar investment strategies, according to paperwork filed last week. “It is rare that a new asset class comes around for the investing masses, and that’s what crypto is now — and Wall Street is always great at creating supply when there is demand,” said Todd Sohn, an ETF strategist at Strategas. “So this is the evolution of the crypto ETF spectrum: futures-based, spot, thematic, and now convertibles, both hyper specific for MicroStrategy and whoever else gets involved in a similar capacity.” Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek Elon Musk Is Not Having a Happy New Year Zyn’s Online Hype Risks Leading to the Nicotine Pouches’ Downfall What Will Elon Musk Do in 2025?

Nick Timoney has agreed a new contract to remain with Ulster until at least 2027 Nick Timoney believes Ulster is the place for him to become “the best I can be” after committing his future with the province until at least 2027. The 29-year-old back-row has signed a two-year contract extension and insists he is ready to be part of a bright future at Ravenhill. Timoney is a key component of Richie Murphy’s squad and delivered a Player of the Match performance last weekend as captain, with Ulster ending a five-game losing run with a 17-7 inter-pro victory over Connacht in Galway. One of Ulster’s longest-serving players having first joined the Ulster Academy in 2015, the former Blackrock College student made his senior debut for the province eight years ago and his full Ireland bow in 2021 against the United States. He has accumulated over 150 caps for Ulster but Timoney isn’t done yet, stating Ravenhill is a place that feels like home to him while expressing his confidence that the side’s new era will be a prosperous one. “I’m delighted to sign a new deal with Ulster,” he said. “I feel very at home here and believe we have the squad to develop and become better in the years ahead. “We have some young talent coming through that adds to our group of experienced players and that is something that both excites and motivates you for the seasons ahead. “I’ve said I want to keep progressing as a player and I fully believe I can become the best I can be here at Ulster.” Ulster General Manager Bryn Cunningham added: “Agreeing terms with Nick before the Christmas period was a high priority for us, and we are delighted that he is fully invested in what we are trying to build here. “Nick is one of the most well-rounded back-row players in Europe and it’s been no surprise to hear about interest in him from other big clubs. “His journey from the Academy, Sevens, to playing for the ‘A’ team and breaking into the senior side has been full of hard work and dedication, and that has helped him develop into the athlete we see today. “He is someone that is a standard-setter to those around him and is a very popular member of the senior squad because of the attitude, commitment and leadership he puts in every week, and he will be a key part of this team’s future.”

Title: Analyst: Palantir Technologies (PLTR) Growth Will Be Ahead of Nvidia in 2025

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Wall Street Is Focusing on These 10 AI Stocks as New Year Begins. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) stands against other stocks Wall Street is focusing on as the new year begins. Dan Niles, Niles Investment Management founder, recently said in a program on CNBC that a slowdown in spending could be a “big problem” for major AI players in 2025. The analyst highlighted that when Satya Nadella was asked whether his company was facing a chip shortage, the head of the Redmond software giant said his company was facing a power shortage, not a chip shortage. Niles said this goes against the claims of Jensen Huang who has been pointing to unprecedented demand for AI chips. “If you look at the Magnificent 7 (except one) …. they are trading at a low 30 PE. The S&P 500 is trading at a 25 PE, but if you look at the midcap and small-cap stocks, which people have forgotten about because they’re not really AI plays, they’re trading at around 19 to 20 times. They’ve underperformed up until sort of mid-year when the performance picked up. If you look at stocks since June 30th, basically, the S&P is up about 8%, but the NASDAQ 100 is only up 7%. The Russell 2000 is actually up 10% after being only up 1% for the first six months of the year. So you’re already starting to see this broadening out, and I think with the new administration really focused on domestic manufacturing, deregulation, etc., that’s going to benefit the small midcap names more so than names in the S&P 500,” Niles said. Niles said stocks can face a “rough” time in the first quarter amid the changing posture of the Fed. “The Fed finally admitted inflation wasn’t transitory. I think that might have been the wakeup call, which is why I think Q1 could be a really rough time for a lot of the, you know, the market as a whole, but a lot of the mega cap stocks as well. As we have to kind of price in the fact that the FED might, you know, they might pause or they might even raise next year, which I think that’s a 50/50 shot of whether they cut, raise, or hold.” READ ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In For this article, we picked 10 AI stocks analysts are talking about heading into 2025. With each company we have mentioned its number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Copyright: welcomia / 123RF Stock Photo Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 43 James E. Demmert from Main Street Research recently said during a program on Schwab Network that Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) surpassed Nvidia in terms of stock performance and it will do the same when it comes to growth in 2025. “I would say Nvidia for just the massive amount of demand that’s been there for their products. But you know, on a stock performance basis as we know Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) just, you know, got up and just took over and really like a turbocharger passed them in stock performance. And I think that says a lot about that, Nvidia’s growth, you know, a lot of it from the hyperscalers is maybe behind it and Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) growth may be ahead of it in 25.” What makes Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) one of the top AI stocks? Its technologies are actually solving the problems of businesses. Palantir’s data technology Ontology is solving the famous hallucination problem for AI systems, thanks to the company’s years of experience with military and defense systems. Earlier this year at an event with customers, Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) shared some specifics on how its customers are being able to reduce costs and increase profits due to its artificial intelligence platform (AIP) that was launched about a year ago. Airbus accelerated A350 production by 33%, BP reduced costs per barrel by 60%, and Jacobs Connect cut power usage by 30%. Panasonic decreased waste by 12%, ESI Group sped up ERP harmonization by 70%, and PG&E reduced transformer ignitions by 65%. Eaton boosted productivity by 25%, while Tyson Foods achieved $200 million in cost savings. However, the company’s revenue growth is expected to slow over the next two years, with estimates suggesting a 22% YoY growth rate, potentially bringing revenues to around $4 billion by fiscal 2026. If Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) can improve margins by 100 basis points annually, it would be able to generate about $1.5 billion in adjusted operating income by FY26, with a present value of $1.3 billion when discounted at 8%. Applying an S&P 500-like growth multiple of 2.5 to 2.75 times earnings, Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) would have a P/E of 46, translating to a price target of $27, significantly down from its current price of $42. Fidelity Growth Strategies Fund stated the following regarding Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “Untimely ownership of Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) (+47%) also hurt the fund’s relative result. This software and services firm, which operates in both government and commercial segments, saw strong growth during the quarter, largely driven by its “AIP” – or Artificial Intelligence Platform – offering. In early August, the company reported Q2 financial results that mostly met somewhat lofty expectations. We established a sizable holding in Palantir Technologies during the quarter, and at quarter end it was the second-largest position and a slight overweight.” Overall, PLTR ranks 10th on our list of stocks Wall Street is focusing on as the new year begins. While we acknowledge the potential of PLTR, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than PLTR but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Unity Software (NYSE:U) and Rigetti Computing (NASDAQ:RGTI) are two of the stocks advancing sharply on the first trading day of 2025. Unity's platform enables computer games to feature "real-time 3D content and experiences," while Rigetti develops quantum-computing products. A close-up of a consumer enjoying the company's games on their mobile device. Unity is climbing 13% after Roaring Kitty, who has inspired multiple meme-stock rallies through his social media contributions, included a depiction of musician Rick James in his post on X. James is known for performing a song called "Unity." Perhaps due to Roaring Kitty's post, the mentions of Unity Software on social media are surging tremendously this morning. Also noteworthy is that on Tuesday night there was a block trade of 1.32 million shares of U stock. Turning to Rigetti, the quantum-computing company's shares are jumping 8.5% after it was reported this morning that State Street, an investment bank, disclosed that it had acquired nearly 310,000 shares of the tech firm's stock in the third quarter. As a result, State Street's stake in Rigetti rose by 12.9% in the third quarter to 2.71 million shares. The bank owned about 1.4% of Rigetti as of the end of Q3, while State Street's position in Rigetti at that time was worth $2.125 million. In the last three months, U stock has gained 21%, while RGTI has zoomed 1,986% higher.

Despite a lack of any real news, Unity Software (U) stock went on a tear Thursday morning. It appears to be a result of the latest tweet from Keith Gill, an investor who also goes by “Roaring Kitty.” During his presidential campaign, Donald Trump promised to impose tariffs on certain Chinese imports, such as solar panels. Although economists still debate whether Trump's tariffs will benefit America's economy, domestic solar producers certainly ...

Tesla shares sank Thursday morning after the electric vehicle maker reported fewer deliveries than analysts had expected for the fourth quarter. Despite all sorts of good news for nuclear energy stocks in general in 2024, the year was not a great one for uranium miners like Uranium Energy in particular. In the face of a stock market that gained more than 25%, Uranium Energy stock actually lost value in 2024, and the big reason for this was the falling value of the uranium it produces. Is Uranium Energy stock a buy? In the closing of the recent trading day, Reddit Inc. (RDDT) stood at $165.91, denoting a +1.51% change from the preceding trading day.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Wall Street Is Focusing on These 10 AI Stocks as New Year Begins. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against other stocks Wall Street is focusing on as the new year begins. Dan Niles, Niles Investment Management founder, recently said in a program on CNBC that a slowdown in spending could be a “big problem” for major AI players in 2025. The analyst highlighted that when Satya Nadella was asked whether his company was facing a chip shortage, the head of the Redmond software giant said his company was facing a power shortage, not a chip shortage. Niles said this goes against the claims of Jensen Huang who has been pointing to unprecedented demand for AI chips. “If you look at the Magnificent 7 (except one) …. they are trading at a low 30 PE. The S&P 500 is trading at a 25 PE, but if you look at the midcap and small-cap stocks, which people have forgotten about because they’re not really AI plays, they’re trading at around 19 to 20 times. They’ve underperformed up until sort of mid-year when the performance picked up. If you look at stocks since June 30th, basically, the S&P is up about 8%, but the NASDAQ 100 is only up 7%. The Russell 2000 is actually up 10% after being only up 1% for the first six months of the year. So you’re already starting to see this broadening out, and I think with the new administration really focused on domestic manufacturing, deregulation, etc., that’s going to benefit the small midcap names more so than names in the S&P 500,” Niles said. Niles said stocks can face a “rough” time in the first quarter amid the changing posture of the Fed. “The Fed finally admitted inflation wasn’t transitory. I think that might have been the wakeup call, which is why I think Q1 could be a really rough time for a lot of the, you know, the market as a whole, but a lot of the mega cap stocks as well. As we have to kind of price in the fact that the FED might, you know, they might pause or they might even raise next year, which I think that’s a 50/50 shot of whether they cut, raise, or hold.” READ ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In For this article, we picked 10 AI stocks analysts are talking about heading into 2025. With each company we have mentioned its number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Copyright: prykhodov / 123RF Stock Photo Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 286 Jason Brown from The Brown Report in November explained his bullish thesis for Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) during a program on Schwab Network. The analyst believes AWS and ecommerce growth are the two key engines for the stock that can drive its price further. Here is what he said about the stock: “According to analysts, eCommerce is growing 88.5% this year, while retail is growing at about 3.6%. That means people going online are growing at double the pace of those going to a physical location. That’s good news for Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). They have the branding and trust where people are willing to put their credit cards in. Montaka Global Investments stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “Secondly, in August, we sold some of our holdings in two tactical positions in the tail of Montaka’s portfolio – Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Kyndryl Holdings (KD) – to take advantage of a near-20% drawdown in the stock price of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). Overall, AMZN ranks 1st on our list of stocks Wall Street is focusing on as the new year begins. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Title: New Year’s Resolution to Embrace CO2 Emissions and Benefits
URL: https://wattsupwiththat.com/2025/01/02/new-years-resolution-to-embrace-co2-emissions-and-benefits/
Time Published: 2025-01-02T14:00:00Z

The world's most viewed site on global warming and climate change By Vijay Jayaraj Scientific advancement and agricultural technology have revolutionized food production, enabling humanity to feed more readily a ballooning population. And working behind these celebrated innovations is an unacknowledged but indispensable contributor to the world’s growing food security: rising atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). The very molecule that has been wrongly branded as a doomsday gas has been contributing to increasing yields for essential crops like rice, wheat and soybeans. Food Security is Serious Business The 20th century’s Green Revolution demonstrated how scientific intervention – including the use of fertilizers – could dramatically boost crop yields. The late 1960s saw a huge turnaround in yields across the globe, thanks to Norman Borlaug’s high-yielding, drought-adaptive, disease-resistant varieties of food crops. Nations that had suffered severe poverty and famine became agricultural giants within a decade or so. Between 1965 and 1970, wheat yields nearly doubled in Pakistan and India, two nations that were once pleading for international aid to rescue their people from malnourishment and starvation. Despite being criticized by some, agricultural advancements in the use of fertilizers, pesticides and gene editing have been vital. Without them, feeding our growing global population would be impossible. But they’re not the complete story. Also driving higher crop yields has been an increasing concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere that began in the 19th century as the Industrial Revolution accelerated. The rate of increase rose further with global industrialization following World War II. C3-C4 Divide: Understanding the Difference Having an especially efficient photosynthetic pathway are C4 plants, which have a four-carbon sugar molecule produced during photosynthesis. These plants, which include corn and sugarcane, have an evolutionary adaptation from millions of years ago that was a response to an atmosphere relatively low in CO2. Thus, C4 crops are already operating near peak efficiency when it comes to CO2 utilization under suitable environmental conditions like that of the present era. In contrast, C3 plants that developed during a time in the distant past when CO2 levels where many times higher than today’s show dramatic responses to increased atmospheric levels of the gas. C3 plants, named for their three-carbon sugar molecule, have a relatively inefficient photosynthetic process. Their stomata – tiny pores on leaves that allow gaseous exchange – must remain open longer to capture sufficient CO2, which leads to greater water loss through transpiration. Higher ambient CO2 levels allow C3 plants to photosynthesize more efficiently while losing less water. The benefits of elevated CO2 aren’t merely theoretical, as proven in field studies that have confirmed laboratory findings. These studies, conducted in real-world conditions, show consistent yield increases across various C3 crops. Wheat yields increase by 20-30% under elevated CO2 conditions, while rice shows increases of between 15-32%. Soybeans, another crucial C3 crop, exhibit yield increases of up to 46% in some studies. Perhaps nowhere is the CO2 effect more evident than in greenhouse cultivation. Modern greenhouse operators routinely boost productivity by elevating CO2 levels to 800-1,000 parts per million (ppm), which are well above current atmospheric levels of around 420 ppm. The results are striking: tomato yields increase by 40-50%, cucumber production rises by 30-40%, and growth of lettuce and other vegetables accelerates significantly. In addition, it has now come to light that even C4 crops – like corn and sugarcane – can benefit from elevated CO2 under conditions of drought and low soil nitrogen. This is big revelation for tropical Asian countries where sugarcane farmers often struggle with insufficient water for their plants. Further research could reveal that the 21st century’s elevated CO2 levels have been aiding crop production there. Understanding CO2‘s role in crop productivity should inform the policy landscape, where governments and corporate entities like Blackrock and Vanguard have incorrectly promoted the reduction of atmospheric CO2 as a “life-saving” endeavor without understanding basic plant biology. The opposite is true: More atmospheric CO2 is a boon to humanity, and less is bad. We should be grateful for the industrial emissions of carbon dioxide that contribute to greater crop productivity instead of spending billions on foolish projects to remove the gas from the air to store it underground. Such initiatives will do nothing to improve the weather while impoverishing people. Today’s release of carbon dioxide through the combustion of coal, oil and natural gas is reversing a process that sequestered CO2 from the atmosphere millions of years and lowered to less than optimum concentrations the amount of the gas available for plant growth. A resolution worth adopting this New Year would be to reject the coordinated demonization of CO2 by climate scaremongers and to celebrate it for what it is: the gas of life.

NOAA & NASA pages on CO2 Greening of the Earth 2016 Maybe the increase in global temperatures will also break the glacial/interglacial cycles this planet has experienced over the last 400,000 years and keep us in a comfortable, warm phase. This will benefit humanity for many thousands of years in the future. The planet was a lousy place to live in about 10,000 years ago with kilometres of ice covering the northern continents. Thanks to R Hannon for the climate stratigraphic sequence presentation of the Holocene cycles, and H Vinos for the ice core graph. oops – J Vinós At that time, there were less than 15 million people. They had plenty of lebensraum The warmunists spend all their energy trying to prove to the Great Unwashed Masses that today’s conditions are tantamount to the oft-forecast “tipping point” that will send us all to hell in a handbasket …. while in reality, this is the greatest period in human history for bountiful food, bountiful energy supplies, long life expectancy, great comforts, and “social justice”. The better we have it in this life, the more miserable the warmunists and cassandras who themselves are the great pollutants of life on earth. Warm-mongers? “Embrace CO2 Emissions and Benefits” We’re entering a cold spell and there’s every chance of our lighting a fire in our – yet to be banned – fireplace. Is there anymore a tight and warm embrace of coal and wood borne CO2 – plus anything else you want to burn? Story tip Net zero ‘nudge unit’ accused of Covid scare tactics will push heat pumps on public Behavioural Insights Team receives £100,000 contract from Government as ministers aim to deliver 300,000 extra home upgrades this year https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2025/01/02/net-zero-nudge-unit-accused-covid-scare-tactics-heat-pumps/ Given that there were less than 40,000 heat pumps of all kinds installed in the UK in 2023 (figures are not yet available for 2024) there is absolutely no chance that an extra 300,000 are going to be installed in 2025. Not in my house… “Modern greenhouse operators routinely boost productivity by elevating CO2 …” In a closed “greenhouse” CO2 has to be added just to replace that consumed by the plants. The elevated term is important. Further, on a windless day, a rapidly growing field, say of corn, will use-up the ambient CO2 and the growth will slow. We should take the captured CO2 from some industrial processes and release it in the fields of growing crops instead of pumping it into underground storage. We could release it into orchards and vineyards. We could submit an application to the USDA for a research funds for these projects. For field work we will need several brand new F-150 Ford pickup trucks. So, are we not at the “tipping point” where we can transition from “Have nothing and be happy” to “Have plenty to eat and be ecstatic” Curious minds want to know. A few days ago Astronomy Picture of the Day APOD put up this statement: “…methane, a greenhouse gas that, if released, could potentially increase the amount of infrared light absorbed by Earth’s atmosphere, and so increase the average temperature of the entire planet. In their Asterisk discussion board it was pointed out that CO2 is beneficial to crops around the world which produced this response: Here In any case, a few percent difference in crop production in either direction isn’t really the issue. It’s the collapse of ocean ecosystems, the shift in location of agricultural zones, the rise of sea level, the huge increase in extreme weather events, the loss of species diversity, and many other things that are defining this as a crisis. Hundreds of millions will die, billions will have their lives disrupted, our global economy will collapse and that will almost certainly continue us on our path away from democracy (already beginning, obviously). It’s not going to be pretty for the next generations. This the mindset that the New Year’s resolution is up against. People really do believe that. Hundreds of millions will die, billions will have their lives disrupted, our global economy will collapse…. If we descend into another glacial cycle. The climate crusaders want us to believe that a warmer world with more CO2 constitutes a crisis. The concentration of CH4 in the air is 1.929 ppmv. One cubic meter of air contains ca. 0.0014 g of CH4. The low concentration of CH4 is due to the initiation of its combustion by discharges of lightning. Everyday there are millions of lightning discharges, especially in the tropics (cf. Wiki). A hydrocarbon, CH4 is readily oxidized by ozone which is produced by lighting discharges. CH4 is slightly soluble in cold water. One liter of ice-cold water can contain 35 mls of CH4. That is not very much, but the cold polar waters a quite large. Jet planes with their large engines are flying vacuum cleaners for CH4. Vehicles with ice’s burn up CH4 in the air they use. Wildfires burn up CH4. We really do not have to worry about CH4. Interesting piece, especially on the C3-C4 divide. Nicely encouraging prospective. …. And another.. this could be made into a badge.. Very nice Vijay, wonderful post. Another great Vijay article My first decade of interest in climate was mainly reading scientific studies of CO2 enrichment and plant growth. I have read at least 200 of them. About 95% were about C3 plants because it was believed another 300 ppm of CO2 would not benefit C4 plants like corn much. But the benefits were larger than predicted. This is just my educated guess because there are no conclusive statistics: Global Food Crops C3 plants 70% of food C4 plants 30% of food Average growth increase per +100 ppm CO2 About 10% NOTE: A huge amount of corn (40% globally) is used as food for steers (not cows), pigs and chickens. Biological Impacts of CO2 20 page Summary of a 1079 page document Microsoft Word – _03-26-14_ CCR-IIb SPM.doc I vaguely recall reading an article somewhere that C4 plants are actually capable of reverting back to C3 processes to make better use of the enhanced atmospheric CO2. I much prefer my beef, range fed rather than corn fed. 🙂 The real cost of Net Zero….. Australia The Real Cost of Net Zero: The shocking truth of the renewable energy push Shown below in the graphic is a plot of the of annual average temperatures for Adelaide. The graphic is from the late John Daly’s website available at: http://www.John-Daly.com. Do think you could go to the BoM and get the temperature data up to 2023? If the trend continues, this would be additional info that CO2 does not cause warming of air. However, it is likely that original weather station has been moved so it would not be possible to complete the plot. While this is a good article. it considerabl;y understates the benefits of CO2. While the harms fail to manifest, the benefits increase linearly to concentration levels well above anything likely to occur. These benefits are massive. Currently most every every crop on the planet grows 12% to 20% more food (conservative estimate) then it would if the atmospheric CO2 level suddenly dropped from 420 PPM to pre-industrial 280 PPM. (280 PPM CO2 is near starvation levels. If CO2 concentration had moved 125 PPM in the opposite direction to only 155 PPM concentration, almost everybody on the planet would starve, and almost all bio-life would cease.) Also, this CO2 caused increased production of bio-life, delivers another stupendous benefit, in that zero increase in water or land acreage is required. Additionally CO2 makes crops more drought, heat, and frost resistant – geographically expanding growing zones and growing seasons! Indeed, if we went to 280 PPM tomorrow, WWIII would happen within weeks. Also there are far more benefits to C4 plants then listed. Please begin here, http://www.co2science.org//subject/c/c4plantbiom.php and there are many more then the multiple links here. …….280 PPM tomorrow, WWIII would happen within weeks. WWWIII is much more likely to result from the brain chemistry of a power crazed politician than from atmospheric chemistry. They are orthogonal. However a 20 percent global drop in food production would cause very rapid global conflict. Story tip: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352938524002416 Add this: Highlights As usual, Vijay’s CO2 essay is excellent. I will reference it in my articles Dutch and Belgium consortia own about 50% of all food supermarkets in the eastern US, which provides plenty of shelf space for display of European farm products, at the expense of US farmers, all as part of our full of holes trade agreements. What is not generally known, Dutch greenhouse owners in Quebec, Canada, receive low cost electricity and gas to provide lighting and CO2 and heat in the winter, during which they grow blueberries, cucumbers, parsnips, tomatoes, etc, which I buy in the Hanneford market, in West Lebanon, NH, owned by a Belgium consortium. Most supermarket chains now charge wholesalers for “shelf space” ….so maybe the US farmers need to get into the kickback game….Canadians, on the other hand value their quota system which insulates their farmers from going bankrupt every time the US has a production bubble. Trump will soon have a tariff system You sell to us, only if you buy from us, to maintain balanced reciprocal trade, otherwise a tariff high enough until you do. The Europeans will go ape shit, hate Trump more, but will have to suck it up. They refuse to buy from us. I personally despise this “hint dropping” in articles, like “…increasing concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere that began in the 19th century as the Industrial Revolution accelerated. The rate of increase rose further with global industrialization following World War II.” This is only reinforcing the belief, that we, the humans are the cause of this “dangerous” increase in CO2 in the atmosphere in less informed, often indoctrinated individuals. There are numerous published studies, some even in this blog, which show convincingly, that burning of fossil fuels is NOT the cause of CO2 increase, and that CO2 is NOT controlling the temperature of the planet. After WWII the NH temperature dropped by at least 0.5C, while beneficial CO2 continued to climb. Of course that period, called the Global COOLING Scare, has now been erased from the temperature records. Login Sign up to comment or become a paid supporter: Click Here “Walk toward the fire.

Title: I wanted to add bitcoin to my portfolio, but wasn't sure about the best strategy for buying in. Here's what 3 experts recommended.

My investing strategy has never been very complicated or flashy. I typically stick to buying index funds. If I'm feeling crazy, I'll throw in an individual blue-chip stock here and there. After purchasing a security, I subscribe to a "leave it alone" strategy, save for a periodic rebalancing once or twice a year; my employer's policy also doesn't allow in-and-out trading. I had never seriously considered buying bitcoin. But in recent weeks I became increasingly curious about the cryptocurrency. Postelection, I sensed what can only be described as a seismic vibe shift concerning bitcoin. Not only has its price shot up, eclipsing $100,000 briefly in December, but trillion-dollar asset managers are throwing their support behind bitcoin. Bitcoin ETFs have taken off, publicly traded companies are adding bitcoin to their coffers, and there are talks of a national bitcoin reserve. BlackRock, the world's biggest asset manager, recently suggested a bitcoin allocation within a multi-asset portfolio. It seemed to me that bitcoin had gained a new sense of legitimacy as an asset class. I decided there was no better way to determine whether bitcoin was really the next big thing — or if Wall Street simply had FOMO — than by buying bitcoin firsthand. I asked three financial experts for guidance on how to start investing in bitcoin. Before taking the plunge, I had some concerns: Was it smart to buy after the price of bitcoin had already run up so much? John Haar, a managing director at the bitcoin-services firm Swan Bitcoin, gave me an analogy: "If someone said 'Am I too late to bitcoin?' my answer would be 'Do you think you're too late to buying real estate or the S&P 500?' If an asset is a good storer of value, then it's going to appreciate over time, and there isn't really a concept of being too late to it." Looking at the price of bitcoin, I lamented my lack of foresight in not having stocked up in 2010, when it was trading at mere cents (never mind that I was 9). But as they say, the second-best time is now. Haar suggested dollar-cost averaging as a way to build up my bitcoin investment. Instead of trying to time the market to buy a dip, I could spend half of a predetermined allocation to bitcoin on an initial purchase, then slowly spend the other half by buying at regular intervals. By not investing in a lump sum, I'd still have the opportunity to take advantage of future price drops, Haar said. Robert Cannon, a financial advisor at Experity Wealth, echoed that sentiment. "If you believe in the future potential and the long-term view," Cannon said, "the best thing to do is dollar-cost averaging." Essentially, if you're thinking about buying and holding bitcoin long term, as I was, the timing of when you buy in is less important than simply just buying in. I also wondered how much of my portfolio I should allocate to bitcoin. David Laut, the chief investment officer at Abound Financial, told me he recommended his clients keep a 5% allocation to a combination of gold and bitcoin if they're looking for a more aggressive investing style. The reason is that these assets aren't typically correlated with the performance of the stock market. Cannon said he'd seen people use bitcoin as an inflation hedge in their portfolios. Ultimately, it depends on your risk tolerance, Cannon told me. He's advised clients with between 1% and 10% of their portfolio in bitcoin. When it came to actually buying bitcoin, I had a few options: I could purchase the cryptocurrency on a centralized or decentralized exchange or through an ETF, or purchase stock in companies related to bitcoin, such as Microstrategy. Many serious bitcoin investors prefer holding bitcoin directly, either on an exchange or through a self-custody wallet, Haar said. That's because ETFs provide bitcoin price exposure but not actual ownership. But Laut and Cannon both said they thought ETFs were a great way for a beginner to invest in bitcoin. "I'd rather own an ETF because then I don't have to worry about Coinbase being hacked," Laut told me. Crypto is still nascent and has risks — Laut pointed to the collapse of FTX two years ago, in which many investors saw their holdings evaporate. Laut said that with an established broker-dealer like Fidelity or Charles Schwab, investors could mitigate regulatory risks. I took the advice from Cannon, Haar, and Laut into consideration as I pondered my options. I decided on the following strategy: I'd allocate 1% of my portfolio to bitcoin to start off, with the option to increase my allocation in the future as I became more familiar with the cryptocurrency. I would invest half of it now and invest the rest over the next six months. I didn't want to go through the hassle of setting up an account on a crypto exchange like Coinbase. Luckily, my brokerage firm Fidelity offered a few ways to get bitcoin exposure, including buying bitcoin directly or through an ETF. I purchased the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF, which Cannon recommended. But there's no shortage of bitcoin ETFs to choose from. Other popular offerings include the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF, and the ProShares Bitcoin ETF. Purchasing a bitcoin ETF was practically the same as purchasing any other stock or ETF, except for one thing: Right before I confirmed the trade, a pop-up message asked me to review and approve an agreement regarding crypto investments and upgrade my investment objective to "most aggressive" before proceeding. It's easier than ever to buy bitcoin, which might make investors underestimate the risk. But bitcoin is still a highly volatile asset, which sets it apart from traditional stocks. "If I told you you could lose everything, how much would you put in there?" Cannon said. For now, 1% seems like a good plan for me. Do you have a bitcoin investing story you'd like to share?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of the 10 Best Environmental Stocks To Invest In Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Clearway Energy, Inc. (NYSE:CWEN) stands against the other best environmental stocks to invest in right now. The United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP29), held in Baku, Azerbaijan, concluded on November 24, with a landmark agreement that sets a new collective goal for climate finance. The agreement, which aims to triple the annual finance to developing countries from the previous goal of $100 billion to $300 billion by 2035, marks a significant step forward in global efforts to combat climate change and support vulnerable nations. Furthermore, this new finance goal, known as the New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG) also aims to scale up collaboration among all actors including governments, private sector entities, and international financial institutions to finance developing countries to reach $1.3 trillion annually by 2035. The progress made at COP29 builds on the global climate action achieved at previous conferences. COP27 established a historic Loss and Damage Fund, while COP28 delivered a global agreement to transition away from all fossil fuels in energy systems swiftly and fairly, tripling renewable energy and boosting climate resilience. The new finance goal at COP29 is a crucial step in ensuring that these commitments are met and that the global community remains on track to limit global warming. According to a report by McKinsey, the $300 billion annual goal for climate financing falls drastically short of the estimated $1 trillion needed annually to meet global targets. On a broader scale, McKinsey estimates that up to $9 trillion per year will be required globally by 2050 to decarbonize physical assets and transition towards a sustainable future. The report highlights that private capital is widely seen as a key enabler in bridging this financing gap. However, many investors remain cautious, not just due to a lack of funds, but due to a shortage of credible, scalable investment opportunities, execution challenges, insufficient risk management, and delays in scaling operations. The geopolitical and macroeconomic environment further complicates the sustainability landscape. Higher interest rates, inflation, and energy supply disruptions have created an environment where cost assumptions from just a few years ago no longer hold true. In light of these dynamics, McKinsey identifies three key strategies for businesses to navigate the complex investment landscape in sustainability. First, companies must reevaluate and refresh sustainability strategies as past assumptions may no longer be valid, and companies must take a pragmatic approach to align their strategies with current realities. Second, businesses must accelerate climate technology industrialization. While renewable energy technologies have made significant progress in cost competitiveness, other emerging technologies, such as hydrogen, long-duration energy storage, and precision fermentation, require further industrialization. Third, companies must address execution risks, streamline supply chains, and ensure they have experienced teams capable of managing large-scale sustainable projects. The report concluded by emphasizing that companies who will act decisively, embrace innovative financing mechanisms, and prioritize operational excellence will not only contribute to global sustainability goals but also position themselves for future growth in an evolving economic landscape. The journey towards a sustainable future requires collaboration, innovation, and accountability across all sectors. While the challenges are significant, the opportunities for growth, resilience, and value creation are even greater. A wind farm in motion, its many turbines spinning in the breeze. To compile our list of the 10 best environmental stocks to invest in right now, we used environmental ETFs plus online rankings to compile an initial list of 20 environment-friendly companies. We then used Insider Monkey’s Hedge Fund database to rank 10 stocks according to the largest number of hedge fund holders, as of Q3 2024.

Title: Is Thermo Fisher Scientific (NYSE:TMO) the Best Low Volatility Stock to Buy Right Now?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 8 Best Low Volatility Stocks To Buy Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) stands against other best low volatility stocks to buy right now. The market has shown strong performance overall, with the S&P 500 up nearly 26% year to date. However, in the past thirty days, it has experienced a slight decline of 1%. A notable sell-off occurred between December 17 and 19, which contributed to some volatility. Since then, the market has been fluctuating, with prices rising and falling as investors continue to navigate the uncertainty. In a CNBC interview, Alan Rechtschaffen, Senior Portfolio Manager at UBS Global Wealth, stressed that he maintains a positive outlook on market growth, emphasizing that the current market sell-off is driven by a lack of faith rather than fundamental issues. He noted that the positivity surrounding the market will improve as President Trump’s policies take effect. Rechtschaffen acknowledged concerns over high interest rates and high debt levels but argued that the Fed’s goal of lowering rates, combined with efforts to reduce spending and increase efficiency, will lead to high growth. He is particularly optimistic about sectors like technology, utilities, and financials, which he believes will benefit from a focus on new energy sources and deregulation. Although valuations are higher than usual, Rechtschaffen believes that with the right efficiencies in place, the market could see a 10% rise, offering opportunities for investors willing to take risks in this promising period. The path of rate cuts in 2025 is creating uncertainty for Wall Street as the Fed’s outlook shifted last week, now forecasting two cuts instead of four. The possibility of a rate hike has not been ruled out if inflation re-accelerates. San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly told Yahoo Finance’s Brian Sozzi that adjustments could be made depending on data, but she doesn’t see inflationary pressures at the moment. However, she isn’t ruling out anything. On Yahoo Finance’s Catalysts, Max Wasserman of Miramar Capital said that he believes the economy is stronger than anticipated, with GDP growth around 3% and inflation at 2.7%, which reduces the need for aggressive rate cuts. He also suggested that a rate hike could become more likely in the second half of 2025 if inflation remains persistent. Wasserman advised a more cautious approach in portfolio management, favoring de-risking strategies, such as taking profits from top-performing stocks and focusing on dividend stocks. He also recommended staying short-term on bonds, as rising interest rates could pressure longer-duration bonds. Additionally, he expressed concerns about potential inflationary policies from the incoming administration, such as changes to immigration or tariffs, which could further strain the economy and complicate the Fed’s path forward. For this article, we used the Yahoo Finance stocks screener to identify 30 companies with the largest market cap and a 5-year beta (monthly) between 0.2 and 0.8. Next, we narrowed our list to 8 stocks most widely held by institutional investors. The 8 best low-risk stocks to buy are listed in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A workstation in a research lab stocked with laboratory products and services. 5-year Beta (Monthly): 0.79 Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 98 Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) provides a wide range of products and services for life sciences, diagnostics, and laboratory research. It offers tools for biological research, drug production, disease diagnosis, and clinical testing. Scotiabank maintains a positive long-term outlook for the life science tools sector, considering it “bullish,” and regards three stocks, including Thermo Fisher, as “some of the highest-quality stocks to own.” However, in the short term, the firm adopts a more neutral stance on these large-cap stocks due to ongoing uncertainties in key markets, particularly biopharma, and China, as well as potential political risks heading into 2024, according to the analyst. On 23 December, as reported by TipRanks, Scotiabank started coverage of Thermo Fisher (NYSE:TMO) with a Sector Perform rating and a price target of $605, while BofA has a price target of $660 on the stock and a Buy rating as reported on December 13. Thermo Fisher’s (NYSE:TMO) acquisitions are delivering strong results. The company’s recent acquisition of Olink Holdings for $3.1 billion, which was finalized in the third quarter, is helping to improve its capabilities in the rapidly growing proteomics market. The acquisition is expected to deliver synergies, with the company projecting $125 million in adjusted operating income synergies by the fifth year. The Binding Site, which is now the company’s protein diagnostics business and was acquired in 2023, continues to perform well. In the third quarter, the company secured an IVDR claim extension in the European Union for its Optilite Freelite Mx, enabling it to assist in diagnosing neurological diseases like multiple sclerosis. Overall, TMO ranks 4th on our list of best low volatility stocks to buy right now. While we acknowledge the potential of TMO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than TMO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Firms End 2024 Stronger With Impressive Gains. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Moderna Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) stands against other firms end 2024 stronger with impressive gains. A lackluster trading persisted throughout the last day of the year, with Wall Street’s main indices ending the day mixed. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped by 0.07 percent, the S&P 500 shed 0.43 percent, and the Nasdaq Composite declined by 0.90 percent. Meanwhile, NYSE Composite inched up by 0.10 percent and S&P Composite rose by 0.44 percent. Despite the lack of catalysts to spark trading, 10 companies–predominantly in the biopharmaceuticals sector–posted impressive gains. Let’s explore the reasons behind their outstanding performance. To come up with Monday’s top gainers, we considered only the stocks with at least $2 billion in market capitalization and $5 million in daily trading volume. A scientist surrounded by vials and beakers in a modern laboratory, proudly displaying a vaccine. Shares of Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA) closed the year on a strong note, rallying by 5.59 percent at $41.58 apiece as investors resorted to bargain-hunting after analysts regarded the company’s valuation as “too cheap.” Year-to-date price, however, marked a 63.04-percent nosedive from the $41.58 booked on January 2, 2024, as the company continued to face a slew of challenges with the continuous lower demand for Covid-19 vaccines. Earlier last year, the vaccine maker announced plans to slash its research and development budget to conserve cash for product launches, but after a year of consistent stock price decline, analysts remained skeptical. In other news, the company announced strengthening its partnership with Merck to purchase $50 million of Personalis common stock, which covers a multi-year extension with Moderna (MRNA) to utilize Personalis’ ImmunoID NeXT Platform and technology for V940/mRNA-4157, an investigational individualized neoantigen therapy that both firms are developing. Overall, MRNA ranks 5th on our list of firms end 2024 stronger with impressive gains. While we acknowledge the potential of MRNA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MRNA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Ethereum Predictions 2025: Expert Shares His Projections
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-predictions-2025-expert/
Time Published: 2025-01-02T08:05:13Z
Full Content:
Anthony Sassano, an independent Ethereum educator, angel investor, advisor, and founder of The Daily Gwei, shared his Ethereum predictions for 2025 via X, outlining a series of significant milestones and advancements he expects to unfold this year. Ethereum will celebrate its 10th birthday this year and Sassano predicts that Ether (ETH) will reach a price of $15,000 by the end of 2025. He anticipates substantial growth in institutional investment, forecasting that ETH Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) will see net inflows exceeding $50 billion throughout the year. Additionally, he expects that staked ETH ETFs will be filed for and receive approval from the Trump administration which will significantly increase demand. Further expanding his Ethereum predictions, Sassano envisions an increase in major Traditional Finance (TradFi) companies and institutions building on it. “More major TradFi companies/institutions start to build on Ethereum,” he predicts, adding, “BlackRock (and partners) launch a layer 2 tokenized RWA platform on Ethereum.” Government adoption features prominently in Sassano’s Ethereum predictions, as he anticipates that multiple nation-states will reveal holdings of ETH as part of their treasury assets. “Multiple nation states reveal that they hold ETH as a treasury asset,” Sassano states. On the technical front, he predicts the rollout of the Pectra upgrade in March or April 2025, “with more blobs and then soon after, blobs will be saturated again.” This will be followed by the Fusaka upgrade in 2026, which he believes will be the “biggest Ethereum upgrade ever.” He also expects the mainnet gas limit to increase to at least 50 million by the end of the year, facilitating greater transaction throughput and scalability. Sassano’s Ethereum predictions also include significant advancements in Layer 2 (L2) solutions. He anticipates that high-performance L2s like MegaETH and Rise will launch, outpacing existing high-performance Layer 1 (L1) networks in efficiency and adoption. Furthermore, he expects Arbitrum One to become the first major rollup to reach stage 2 decentralization, with many other rollups achieving stage 1 decentralization. In addition to these developments, Sassano predicts that Base will spin out from Coinbase and announce token and decentralization plans.Sassano explained the reasons for this, “Because Base is an incubated project within Coinbase that is achieving escape velocity at this point. Would make a lot of sense for it to spin out logically into its own team (while still having all the same Coinbase support) – gives them more freedom, flexibility and independence without having to worry so much about regulations and potential bureaucracy in-house.” He also foresees that a based rollup will enter the top five as measured by Total Value Locked (TVL), and a major optimistic rollup will transition into a zk rollup. Infrastructure advancements remain a critical component of Sassano’s Ethereum predictions. He expects the total ETH bridged into L2s to exceed 10 million, enhancing the network’s scalability and efficiency. Moreover, Sassano projects that AI agents will remain the dominant meta throughout 2025. Concluding his Ethereum predictions, Sassano expressed strong confidence in ETH’s future. “Ethereum will turn 10 years old in 2025 and I’m very confident that this year will be Ethereum’s most bullish year yet! Ethereum is the world computer; ETH is money,” he declared. At press time, ETH traded at $3,415. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: Institutions along with individual investors who hold considerable shares inInnodata Inc. (NASDAQ:INOD) come under pressure; lose 8.3% of holdings value

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. The considerable ownership by individual investors in Innodata indicates that they collectively have a greater say in management and business strategy The top 25 shareholders own 41% of the company Insiders have sold recently Every investor in Innodata Inc. (NASDAQ:INOD) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 54% to be precise, is individual investors. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk). While institutions, who own 41% shares weren’t spared from last week’s US$104m market cap drop, individual investors as a group suffered the maximum losses Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Innodata, beginning with the chart below. See our latest analysis for Innodata Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices. We can see that Innodata does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Innodata's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story. Innodata is not owned by hedge funds. BlackRock, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 6.9% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 5.4% and 5.3%, of the shares outstanding, respectively. Additionally, the company's CEO Jack Abuhoff directly holds 4.1% of the total shares outstanding. A deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority. While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future. While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it. Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group. We can report that insiders do own shares in Innodata Inc.. The insiders have a meaningful stake worth US$60m. Most would see this as a real positive. Most would say this shows alignment of interests between shareholders and the board. Still, it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. The general public -- including retail investors -- own 54% of Innodata. This level of ownership gives investors from the wider public some power to sway key policy decisions such as board composition, executive compensation, and the dividend payout ratio. I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. For instance, we've identified 3 warning signs for Innodata (2 don't sit too well with us) that you should be aware of. If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink. Luckily, you can check this free report showing analyst forecasts for its future.

Title: Why Is Viking Therapeutics, Inc. (VKTX) Among the Best Multibagger Stocks to Buy Right Now?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best Multibagger Stocks to Buy Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Viking Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:VKTX) stands against the other multibagger stocks. The US equities continued their upward movement in 2024 and fueled the S&P 500 to record highs. Much of this optimism in the broader market was backed by the strong US economy and the Federal Reserve’s stance to cut interest rates. As per PBS News, 2024 saw several familiar winners, like big technology stocks. These stocks got even bigger due to continuous increases in their stock prices. Apart from certain tech giants, strong momentum was also seen in Bitcoin, gold, and other investments. Ameriprise Financial reported that 2024 had a strong start, with the S&P 500 Index concluding the Q1 on a high note due to a healthy US economic backdrop, moderating inflation, improvement in profit conditions, and anticipations of rate cuts from the US Fed. The strong growth momentum continued in Q2 as the S&P 500 Index saw its strongest three-quarter run since mid-2021. Ameriprise Financial highlighted that an AI boom again drove healthy gains throughout IT and communication services. However, increased rates and a pause by the US Fed capped broader market gains. In September, the US Fed reduced its policy rate for the first time since 2020, concluding its aggressive rate-hiking cycle to control inflation. Therefore, it began a new monetary policy stance that supported economic growth and the labor market. Additionally, since the election, investors’ confidence has been further boosted towards risky assets, including equities.

The US is expected to remain a global growth engine with the expansionary business cycle, healthy labor market, broadening of AI-associated capital spending, and the prospect of strong capital markets and dealmaking activity. Furthermore, BlackRock sees several factors expected to support stocks in 2025. The decisive election result removed key uncertainty hanging over the broader US market. The rally that was seen after the results might continue into the start of 2025 primarily because of prospects of tax cuts and deregulation throughout key industries. While the impact of some policies remains uncertain, history has a long-term record of positive returns in 1st year of a Presidential term. The firm also believes that earnings and valuations hint at healthy potential for a continued broadening of the market. Its analysis of the S&P 500 data reflects that earnings for Mag 7 stocks outperformed the broader market by 37% in 2023. This earnings gap was narrowed across 2024. Now, it expects it to decline to 7.5% in 2025. Our Methodology To list the 12 Best Multibagger Stocks to Buy Right Now, we used a screener to shortlist the stocks that have gained over 100% over the past year and have healthy average upside potential. Finally, the stocks are arranged in ascending order of their average upside potential, as of 30th December 2024. We also mentioned the hedge fund sentiment around each stock, as of Q3 2024. At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 41 One-year Return: ~117% Average Upside Potential: ~176% Market Cap as of 30th December: $4.44 billion Viking Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:VKTX) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company, which focuses on the development of novel therapies for metabolic and endocrine disorders. Wall Street remains optimistic about Viking Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:VKTX)’s lead program, VK2735, and its long-term growth potential. VK2735 is a novel dual-agonist designed to target the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptors. This combination enhances metabolic benefits for conditions such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. Viking Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:VKTX) made headway in its clinical trials for VK2735. Recent developments have demonstrated VK2735 leading to significant weight loss results, bolstering the confidence of the investors. As per Maximize Market Research, the obesity treatment market size is expected to reach ~US$32.50 billion by 2029. Dual-agonists, like VK2735, reflect promise in delivering greater weight loss and glycemic control compared to GLP-1 monotherapies, placing Viking Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:VKTX) for long-term growth. Viking Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:VKTX)’s clinical trials of VK2735 (both injectable and oral formulations) continue to progress well, with results so far indicating strong efficacy and tolerability. A successful transition to late-stage trials and eventual FDA approval should unlock additional opportunities for partnerships, licensing, or global commercialization. Fred Alger Management, an investment management company, sees material upside to Viking Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:VKTX)’s stock on the back of the company’s GLP-1 drug, which it believes has the potential to be a best-in-class obesity drug considering its favorable efficacy and safety profile. Here's what the firm said in its Q2 2024 letter: “Viking Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:VKTX) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing novel therapies for patients suffering from metabolic and endocrine disorders. Their lead drug VK2809, a beta-selective thyroid hormone receptor agonist, is in development for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Their VK2735 drug is a GLP-1 dual agonist being developed for patients with obesity. During the quarter, the company’s shares were negatively impacted by several factors: 1) a challenging environment for biotechnology stocks, exacerbated by Fed policy decisions to maintain elevated interest rates, 2) increased competition in the obesity treatment landscape, 3) manufacturability and scalability concerns regarding Viking’s obesity drug and 4) the absence of strategic partnerships from large pharmaceutical companies. Despite the challenging quarter, we continue to believe that the company’s GLP-1 drug has the potential to be a best-in-class obesity drug given its favorable efficacy and safety profile. Further, with approximately one-third of U.S. adults suffering from obesity, we believe the company’s GLP[1]1 drug has the potential to address a large market once approved.” Overall VKTX ranks 1st on our list of the best multibagger stocks to buy right now. While we acknowledge the potential of VKTX as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than VKTX but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best Multibagger Stocks to Buy Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where MicroStrategy Incorporated (NASDAQ:MSTR) stands against the other multibagger stocks. The US equities continued their upward movement in 2024 and fueled the S&P 500 to record highs. Much of this optimism in the broader market was backed by the strong US economy and the Federal Reserve’s stance to cut interest rates. As per PBS News, 2024 saw several familiar winners, like big technology stocks. These stocks got even bigger due to continuous increases in their stock prices. Apart from certain tech giants, strong momentum was also seen in Bitcoin, gold, and other investments. Ameriprise Financial reported that 2024 had a strong start, with the S&P 500 Index concluding the Q1 on a high note due to a healthy US economic backdrop, moderating inflation, improvement in profit conditions, and anticipations of rate cuts from the US Fed. The strong growth momentum continued in Q2 as the S&P 500 Index saw its strongest three-quarter run since mid-2021. Ameriprise Financial highlighted that an AI boom again drove healthy gains throughout IT and communication services. However, increased rates and a pause by the US Fed capped broader market gains. In September, the US Fed reduced its policy rate for the first time since 2020, concluding its aggressive rate-hiking cycle to control inflation. Therefore, it began a new monetary policy stance that supported economic growth and the labor market. Additionally, since the election, investors’ confidence has been further boosted towards risky assets, including equities.

The US is expected to remain a global growth engine with the expansionary business cycle, healthy labor market, broadening of AI-associated capital spending, and the prospect of strong capital markets and dealmaking activity. Furthermore, BlackRock sees several factors expected to support stocks in 2025. The decisive election result removed key uncertainty hanging over the broader US market. The rally that was seen after the results might continue into the start of 2025 primarily because of prospects of tax cuts and deregulation throughout key industries. While the impact of some policies remains uncertain, history has a long-term record of positive returns in 1st year of a Presidential term. The firm also believes that earnings and valuations hint at healthy potential for a continued broadening of the market. Its analysis of the S&P 500 data reflects that earnings for Mag 7 stocks outperformed the broader market by 37% in 2023. This earnings gap was narrowed across 2024. Now, it expects it to decline to 7.5% in 2025. Our Methodology To list the 12 Best Multibagger Stocks to Buy Right Now, we used a screener to shortlist the stocks that have gained over 100% over the past year and have healthy average upside potential. Finally, the stocks are arranged in ascending order of their average upside potential, as of 30th December 2024. We also mentioned the hedge fund sentiment around each stock, as of Q3 2024. At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 25 One-year Return: ~342% Average Upside Potential: ~81.5% Market Cap as of 30th December: $64.1 billion MicroStrategy Incorporated (NASDAQ:MSTR) offers AI-powered enterprise analytics software and services. MicroStrategy Incorporated (NASDAQ:MSTR)’s strategic pivot towards Bitcoin acquisition placed it well in the public markets, providing investors indirect exposure to the world's largest cryptocurrency. At the core of the company’s current strategy is its aggressive Bitcoin acquisition plan. It has been utilizing a combination of cash from operations, debt issuance, and equity raises to finance its Bitcoin purchases. MicroStrategy Incorporated (NASDAQ:MSTR)’s Bitcoin strategy provides investors with significant potential upside if Bitcoin prices appreciate. With the company accumulating more Bitcoin, any appreciation in Bitcoin's value is expected to be magnified in the company’s stock price. The strategy offers a way for investors to provide exposure to Bitcoin via publicly-traded company, which can be more accessible or compliant with certain investment mandates than direct cryptocurrency investments. If Bitcoin gets wider adoption as a store of value or hedge against inflation, MicroStrategy Incorporated (NASDAQ:MSTR)’s early position can result in substantial returns. In October, the company unveiled its plans to garner $42 billion in fresh capital for Bitcoin purchases over the upcoming 3 years. It holds 252,220 bitcoins as of September 30, 2024. The new capital-raising plan, called the "21/21 Plan," focuses on securing $21 billion via equity offerings and another $21 billion through fixed-income securities over 2025 and 2027. While there is optimism around the company’s stock, Artisan Partners, an investment management company, has avoided this company because the firm believes there is a lack of conviction in its franchise characteristics. Here's what the firm said in its Q2 2024 letter: “Regarding MicroStrategy Incorporated (NASDAQ:MSTR), our decision to avoid this company comes down to a lack of conviction in its franchise characteristics. The stock has worked this year due to a rebound in the price of bitcoin. Since 2020, MicroStrategy has been focused on converting its cash and cash equivalent holdings, as well as issuing debt, to fund the purchase of bitcoin, which now makes up most of the company’s value.” Overall MSTR ranks 5th on our list of the best multibagger stocks to buy right now. While we acknowledge the potential of MSTR as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than MSTR but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Jim Cramer’s Take on HCA Healthcare (HCA): Bold Predictions for the Future

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer's Bold Predictions About These 10 Healthcare Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA) stands against the other healthcare stocks Jim Cramer has made bold predictions about. Healthcare has been one of Jim Cramer's favorite topics lately. The tail end of the year has pushed a portion of the sector, namely healthcare benefit managers and pharmaceutical chains, into Wall Street's spotlight. Investors were particularly anxious after President-elect Trump's remarks during a press conference at Mar-e-Lago. At the event, he promised to take on the healthcare middleman due to the high costs that Americans were facing. Americans are "paying far too much. . . .much more than other countries" for healthcare, shared Trump. He pointed at what he believes is the heart of the problem. According to Trump, "We have a thing called the middle man, you know, the middle man right? The horrible middleman that makes more money frankly than the drug companies. And they don’t do anything except they’re a middleman.” The role played by the healthcare middlemen has also made the President-elect vow to “knock out the middle man" despite understanding that he's "going to be very unpopular after that.” Cramer has spent several shows discussing either the broader impact of the President-elect's goal on the benefits management industry or the impact on specific companies. After Trump shared his plans for the middlemen, Cramer pointed out that the industry does enjoy significant reach. He shared "I think that what, if President-elect Trump follows up about knocking out the middleman, he will. He will because these companies will eventually lose their support in Congress.” This is because Cramer believes that once the different levers of the US government (Republicans, Democrats, and the Executive) act in unison then, “when you have that kind of come together over them, you don’t wanna be in that business.” However, he cautioned that the big companies are not completely vulnerable. "These companies are not, uh, without their friends," shared Cramer. He also added that the firms also "resent the middlemen. Cardinal’s had a lot to be able to be a little bit more forward about what can be done. [MCK] is considered to be a company that has done a lot to be able to make it so smaller drug stores get product.” Yet, while the companies might have friends, some of them are vulnerable as well. Later during his show, Cramer commented on the firm that ranks 13th on this list. He shared that this firm is "viewed as being part of the problem of the cost of healthcare," and added that "they have no friends." He also mentioned another firm in a later program. This stock ranks 6th on our list of stocks Cramer talked about after the Fed's interest rate cut. He believes that "Look I think that if I were the people at [the healthcare benefit managers], when the President-elect decides that he is going to take a shot at you, as we know from his first time around, it’s not one off. There’s multiple shots. Multiple attempts to say listen you guys are . . . friction. I would not buy these stocks." Commenting on President-elect Trump and his partner Elon Musk, Cramer commented "I mean these guys are powerful one-two combination." The rather sharp remarks for the pharma benefits manager were somewhat of a departure from Cramer's earlier comments. For the same stock, he shared “Can we just say that the middlemen have been under fire for decades. And they are always, they always, McKesson is always standing. McKesson has just defied everyone. Right. They defy everybody. No one can touch McKesson.” Overall though Cramer believes that the healthcare benefits management sector might be in for trouble in the future. Investors also appear to be cognizant of this reality with some stocks down 45.57% year-to-date. Within this turmoil, let's see how his previous stock predictions have fared. To compile our list of Jim Cramer's bold predictions about healthcare stocks, we scanned the stocks he mentioned in Mad Money and Squawk on the Street as far back as in August. Then, we picked out pharma, hospital management, and healthcare benefit management stocks and ranked them by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q3 2024. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 66 Date of Cramer’s Comments: 09-05-24 Performance Since Then: 24.8% HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA) is one of the biggest hospital managers in America. It operates inpatient and outpatient care facilities, and as a result, is dependent to a large extent on the US government's healthcare benefit programs for its revenue. HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA)'s shares dropped by 10% in October after Hurricane Helene reduced its revenue by $50 million and led to a Q3 EPS miss by seven cents. The 10% share price drop erased the gains that the firm had made in the second half. Here's what Cramer said about HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA) in September: "In the interest of keeping things fresh, let me give you a new idea, one we talked about not that long ago: HCA Healthcare. That’s the big hospital chain. HCA has been making a mint from the major uptick in patients coming in for non-urgent procedures. Incredibly, there's still a huge backlog of people who postponed going to the hospital during the pandemic. Overall, HCA ranks 4th on our list of healthcare stocks Jim Cramer has made bold predictions about. While we acknowledge the potential of HCA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than HCA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

It also gained prominence earlier this year through its CASGEVY treatment which became the world's first gene-editing-based treatment for Sickle Cell Disease. However, the latter half of 2024 has been nothing short of devastating for Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (NASDAQ:VRTX)'s shares. The stock sank by 11% in December after the firm's highly hyped non-addictive painkiller thought to have the potential to replace opioids failed to meet objectives. Here's what Cramer said about Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (NASDAQ:VRTX) in August: "I think Vertex is great. Look, its fibrosis franchise is incredible, and a terrible disease. But I also like the fact that what they're doing in terms of opiates—look, this is a great company. No one ever talks about it. We've had them on. I think that they're brilliant. Okay, per period.

The company board of directors announced it stands firm on the company’s DEI initiatives. “Our success at Costco Wholesale has been built on service to our critical stakeholders: employees, members and suppliers. Our efforts around diversity, equity and inclusion follow our code of ethics,” it stated and urged stockholders to vote against the NCPPR proposal. Voting will take place on Jan. 23. Now Costco, the nation’s third-largest retailer after number one Walmart and number two Amazon, is embroiled in the politically and emotionally-charged DEI controversy as calls for a Costco boycott are beginning to emerge, according to Newsweek. Anti-DEI crusader Robby Starbuck, who claims victory in getting Walmart, not only the largest retailer but the nation’s largest private employer, to roll back its DEI initiatives, posted on X: “For now I suggest conservative consumers find other places to spend their money if Costco is so dedicated to doubling down on DEI. If they’re smart, Costco will do right by their shareholders and change before we turn our attention to them.” NCPRR is making a simple and straightforward proposal: “to conduct research and publish a report on the risks to the Company maintaining its current DEI (including ‘People & Communities’) roles, policies and goals.” This is hardly an unreasonable request following last year’s Supreme Court ruling that found Harvard University’s race-based admissions policies violated the 14th Amendment. While that ruling didn’t specifically affect business employment and hiring practices, it raised the threat of future legal battles aimed at corporate DEI programs. In addition to Walmart, other companies are reassessing their DEI programs. Ford Motor Company, Harley Davidson, Toyota, Boeing, Tractor Supply, Molson Coors, Brown Foreman, John Deere, Microsoft, Southwest Airlines, Home Depot, Lowe’s and Caterpillar are among the major corporations that have dialed back DEI initiatives. Their prudence is warranted since the business case supporting DEI programs and their ideological underpinnings is losing ground as more research emerges, like the study published by professors Jeremiah Green and John R.M. Hand in the Econ Journal Watch. They tried to replicate numerous studies by McKinsey that served as a foundation for corporate DEI programs and found the McKinsey studies flawed. “[O]ur results indicate that despite the imprimatur often given to McKinsey’s 2015, 2018, 2020, and 2023 studies, McKinsey’s studies neither conceptually … nor empirically … support the argument that large US public firms can expect on average to deliver improved financial performance if they increase the racial/ethnic diversity of their executives,” they wrote. Further evidence emerged in December when a Federal Court vacated the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) approval of a proposed Nasdaq board diversity rule. The rule, which the SEC originally approved in 2021 but was never implemented due to legal challenges, would have required those listed on the exchange to include at least two directors who are “diverse,” including at least one director who self-identifies as female and at least one director who self-identifies as an underrepresented minority or LGBTQ. Harvard Law Professor Jesse Fried took issue with the basis of Nasdaq’s board diversity claims: “Nasdaq cannot cite any high-quality study showing that board gender or ethnic diversity boosts returns, because there has been none. In fact, there is a sizeable body of academic work reporting the opposite results: diversifying boards can harm financial performance,” he posted on the Harvard Law School Forum on Corporate Governance. The SEC could appeal that ruling, though with the Trump administration taking office later this month, it is unlikely to do so. Nonetheless, Costco opposes studying the company’s DEI program and accuses NCPRR of having a “broader agenda” to abolish its diversity initiatives rather than reducing risks to the company and its stockholders. “We believe that the proponent’s request for a study reflects a policy bias with which we disagree and that further study and reporting would not be an efficient use of Company resources,” the board explained. Stefan J. Padfield, JD, director of the Free Enterprise Project at the National Center for Public Policy Research, doesn’t deny his organization’s opposition to DEI. “We oppose DEI because corporate diversity initiatives are race-discrimination initiatives and institutionalize, among other things, race discrimination,” he shared with me. “They expose companies to legal and reputational risks. Thus, our broader goals are perfectly consistent with value-maximization goals of our fellow shareholders,” he continued. Asking Costco to objectively and rigorously study the risks associated with its DEI policies and practices is compelling. NCPPR’s proposal cites the $25.6 million judgment against Starbucks after a Federal Court found race discrimination played a part in the firing of a white former Starbucks regional manager. Given Costco’s reporting on the makeup of its 310,000 employee base, NCPPR figures it has at least 200,000 employees who might claim illegal discrimination because they are white, Asian, male or straight, resulting in similar costly judgments if “only a fraction of those employees were to file suit.” “Simply asking shareholders to trust the status quo at Costco is insufficient,” Padfield said. “This is a rapidly changing landscape in terms of law, regulation and market sentiment and shareholders accordingly have good reason to ask for a review of practices, legal advice and managerial information gathering and processing.” Amazon recently completed such a two-year study conducted by the law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton, and Garrison, which identified areas of improvement and gave Amazon confidence to continue its DEI program. One suspects Costco’s board doesn’t believe its own program would bear such scrutiny. “The report requested by this proposal would not provide meaningful additional information to our shareholders and the Board unanimously recommends a vote against this proposal,” it stated. Yet businesses, especially those of the size and reach of Costco, make decisions based on data. How can a responsible corporate board and executive leadership not want more information, rather than less, on which to make major strategic decisions related to far-reaching corporate employment practices? What shareholder wouldn’t demand the company justify its position as recent research and rulings are turning against DEI orthodoxy and other companies are dialing back their previous initiatives? As W. Edwards Deming famously said, “In God we trust. All others must bring data.” In a seminal Harvard Business Review article, “Getting Serious about Diversity: Enough Already with the Business Case,” Robin Ely, Harvard professor of business management, and Morehouse College president David Thomas stated: “Leaders may mean well when they tout the economic payoffs of hiring more women and people of color, but there is no research support for the notion that diversifying the workforce automatically improves a company’s performance.” They argue for business leaders to adopt a “learning-orientation” to measure the real-world effectiveness of such programs. “To make real progress, people – and the organizational cultures they inhabit – must change. But instead of doing the hard work involved, companies have generally stuck with easier, more limited approaches that don’t alter the status quo.” It appears Costco is not ready to step up to Ely’s and Thomas’ “learning-and-effectiveness approach” to put its DEI program under the microscope, like Amazon, to find out where it’s working and where it’s not, so appropriate changes can be made. What’s to fear by Costco examining its DEI policies and practices? Significant good might come from it. “The problem is that nearly 25 years later, organizations have largely failed to adopt a learning orientation toward diversity and are no closer to reaping its benefits. Instead, business leaders and diversity advocates alike are advancing a simplistic and empirically unsubstantiated version of the business case,” Ely and Thomas wrote. “They misconstrue or ignore what abundant research has now made clear: Increasing the numbers of traditionally underrepresented people in your workforce does not automatically produce benefits. Taking an ‘add diversity and stir’ approach will not spur leads in your firm’s effectiveness or financial performance.” One can argue that if Costco were to adopt NCPPR’s proposal for a study and found significant benefits from its DEI policies, it would be a major step forward for the company and the business community at large. Ely and Thomas stress the moral imperative for diversity in the corporate culture, calling on leaders to “embrace a broader vision of success that encompasses learning, innovation, creativity, flexibility, equity and human dignity.” However, they reveal in their HBR article that businesses by and large haven’t realized diversity’s full potential. If Costco believes in what it says and can prove it, it would be a case study in doing DEI right that other business leaders would gratefully follow. Costco is steadfastly holding to its current policies founded on its code of ethics. “Our focus on diversity, equity and inclusion is not, however, only for the sake of improved financial performance but to enhance our culture and well-being of people whose lives we influence,” it stated. Yet it is unwilling to objectively measure if its admirable four-part code of ethics – Obey the law. Take care of our members. Take care of our employees. Respect our suppliers. – is fully realized through its current “People and Communities” program. And for shareholders, the financial risks and rewards should be measured too, as the legal and regulatory environment is changing. The Costco board opposes the proxy proposal not necessarily on the grounds of the request but on who’s making it: the National Center for Public Policy Research and its Free Enterprise Project. An analysis of the 2024 proxy season by the law firm Sullivan & Cromwell found that NCPPR was a top proponent last year, filing 54 proxy proposals with over half (31) aimed at social/political issues. BlackRock, Kohl’s, Home Depot and CVS were among its targets. Overall, social/political proxy proposals garnered the most submissions, a total of 365, but only one such shareholder proposal passed. The average number of votes cast in favor was only 15%. That said, the chances of NCPPR prevailing in its proposal for Costco to conduct a study of its DEI program and give a report to shareholders is slim to none. But NCPPR intends to keep fighting. Deputy director for NCPPR’s Free Enterprise Project, Ethan Peck shared, “DEI is the redistribution of opportunity – for employees, potential employees and suppliers – on the basis of race and sex. It is not only immoral; it’s illegal and runs the risks of future litigation. “Adopting DEI under immense public pressure during the summer of 2020 was one thing, but doubling down on it after years of sunlight exposing what DEI entails, and multiple court decisions that increase the litigation risks of DEI, is much more radical,” he said. To which, Costco seems to say, “Bring it on.” Note: Costco did not respond to a request for comment.

Title: Why Is Insmed Incorporated (INSM) Among the Best Multibagger Stocks to Buy Right Now?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best Multibagger Stocks to Buy Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Insmed Incorporated (NASDAQ:INSM) stands against the other multibagger stocks. The US equities continued their upward movement in 2024 and fueled the S&P 500 to record highs. Much of this optimism in the broader market was backed by the strong US economy and the Federal Reserve’s stance to cut interest rates. As per PBS News, 2024 saw several familiar winners, like big technology stocks. These stocks got even bigger due to continuous increases in their stock prices. Apart from certain tech giants, strong momentum was also seen in Bitcoin, gold, and other investments. Ameriprise Financial reported that 2024 had a strong start, with the S&P 500 Index concluding the Q1 on a high note due to a healthy US economic backdrop, moderating inflation, improvement in profit conditions, and anticipations of rate cuts from the US Fed. The strong growth momentum continued in Q2 as the S&P 500 Index saw its strongest three-quarter run since mid-2021. Ameriprise Financial highlighted that an AI boom again drove healthy gains throughout IT and communication services. However, increased rates and a pause by the US Fed capped broader market gains. In September, the US Fed reduced its policy rate for the first time since 2020, concluding its aggressive rate-hiking cycle to control inflation. Therefore, it began a new monetary policy stance that supported economic growth and the labor market. Additionally, since the election, investors’ confidence has been further boosted towards risky assets, including equities.

The US is expected to remain a global growth engine with the expansionary business cycle, healthy labor market, broadening of AI-associated capital spending, and the prospect of strong capital markets and dealmaking activity. Furthermore, BlackRock sees several factors expected to support stocks in 2025. The decisive election result removed key uncertainty hanging over the broader US market. The rally that was seen after the results might continue into the start of 2025 primarily because of prospects of tax cuts and deregulation throughout key industries. While the impact of some policies remains uncertain, history has a long-term record of positive returns in 1st year of a Presidential term. The firm also believes that earnings and valuations hint at healthy potential for a continued broadening of the market. Its analysis of the S&P 500 data reflects that earnings for Mag 7 stocks outperformed the broader market by 37% in 2023. This earnings gap was narrowed across 2024. Now, it expects it to decline to 7.5% in 2025. Our Methodology To list the 12 Best Multibagger Stocks to Buy Right Now, we used a screener to shortlist the stocks that have gained over 100% over the past year and have healthy average upside potential. Finally, the stocks are arranged in ascending order of their average upside potential, as of 30th December 2024. We also mentioned the hedge fund sentiment around each stock, as of Q3 2024. At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A biopharmaceutical research team taking notes in front of a laboratory's microscope. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 67 One-year Return: ~130% Average Upside Potential: ~32.4% Market Cap as of 30th December: $12.3 billion Insmed Incorporated (NASDAQ:INSM) is a biopharmaceutical company, which is engaged in developing and commercializing therapies for patients with serious and rare diseases. Expected for launch in mid-2025, Brensocatib represents a major near-term catalyst for Insmed Incorporated (NASDAQ:INSM). The successful commercialization of this drug can significantly impact the company's financial outlook. Brensocatib targets the underlying cause of inflammation in NCFBE (Non-Cystic Fibrosis Bronchiectasis) by inhibiting neutrophil serine proteases (NSPs). Current treatments only manage symptoms, and there are no approved therapies to address the underlying inflammation. If Brensocatib achieves rapid market adoption and meets or surpasses sales projections, it can fuel substantial top-line growth for Insmed Incorporated (NASDAQ:INSM). This will offer immediate financial benefits and will also validate the company's R&D capabilities. Insmed Incorporated (NASDAQ:INSM) believes Brensocatib and non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis alone to be a $5 billion-plus peak sales operating opportunity. The success in the bronchiectasis market can offer the company a platform to expand into associated respiratory conditions or rare diseases. As per Wall Street, the expertise and infrastructure developed for bronchiectasis can be used to ramp up the development and commercialization of treatments for other indications, multiplying Insmed Incorporated (NASDAQ:INSM)’s addressable market. TimesSquare Capital Management, an equity investment management company, sees material upside to Insmed Incorporated (NASDAQ:INSM)’s stock on the back of optimism around Brensocatib. Here's what the firm said in its Q3 2024 letter: “Vaxcyte, Inc. (developer of vaccines) and Insmed Incorporated (NASDAQ:INSM) (developer of treatments for various pulmonary diseases). Insmed has one commercially approved treatment for lung infections that is under review for expanded use. Recently another treatment reported positive clinical data that paves the way for a commercial launch in 2025. The latter, Brensocatib, will be the first approved to treat directly chronic bronchial issues that currently only have symptom mitigation methods.” Overall INSM ranks 12th on our list of the best multibagger stocks to buy right now. While we acknowledge the potential of INSM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than INSM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Trump's billionaires will have to navigate a complex web of possible conflicts of interest
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/trumps-billionaires-conflicts-of-interest-elon-musk-cabinet-ethics-2025-1
Time Published: 2025-01-01T11:11:01Z
Full Content:
President-elect Donald Trump is stocking his administration and broader orbit with billionaires and titans of industry. Their résumés and portfolios also come with a bevy of potential conflicts of interest that could overshadow their actual jobs. Elon Musk may receive the lion's share of the attention, but he's far from the only billionaire in Trump's orbit who has benefited from government contracts. "This Trump administration is just chocked full of billionaires, millionaires, and lobbyists," Craig Holman, a lobbyist for government watchdog Public Citizen, recently told Business Insider. Trump tapped private equity billionaire Stephen Feinberg to become his second-highest-ranking official at the Pentagon. Feinberg's firm, Cerberus Capital Management, has significant interests in military defense contractors, which, as deputy director of defense, could pose a conflict given that the Pentagon's No. 2 is typically responsible for the Defense Department's massive budget. Earlier this year, Cerberus acquired a controlling interest in M1 Support Services, an aircraft maintenance contractor. In fiscal year 2024 alone, M1 has been awarded over $630.7 million in federal contracts, according to USASpending.gov contract data. Cerberus also has a large stake in Navistar Defense, a specialized military vehicle manufacturer. In 2021, Navistar paid a $50 million fine to resolve a complaint that accused the company of inflating the prices of mine-resistant vehicles it sold to the US Marine Corps from 2007 to 2012, before Feinberg's firm bought a 70% stake in 2018. Musk has an even wider portfolio of responsibilities. Unlike Feinberg, the Tesla CEO is set to remain outside the Trump administration — meaning the world's richest man would not be subject to the potential divestment full-time administration officials may be asked to do. "He definitely has a vision for humanity and he views himself as a world historic figure, and he knows his wealth is necessary to fulfilling his vision," Jeff Hauser, executive director of the Revolving Door Project, a public interest group, told Business Insider earlier this month. "So I am frightened by what government by people like that looks like." All of Trump's appointees who enter the government will have to comply with the criminal conflict of interest law. Congress did not apply that law to the president or vice president, in part due to constitutional concerns. Congressional Democrats have raised concern about Musk's ties to China. He called for the expulsion of Rep. Rosa DeLauro, the top Democrat on the powerful House Appropriations Committee, after she and other liberal lawmakers questioned whether Musk helped kill a sweeping government funding bill due to its inclusion of restrictions on certain US investments in China. Trump told Time Magazine that he's seen Musk put the country ahead of his financial interests. "I think he's one of the very few people that would have the credibility to do it, but he puts the country before, and I've seen it, before he puts his company," Trump said. In response to questions about potential conflicts of interest, Brian Hughes, a Trump-Vance Transition spokesperson, said in a statement to Business Insider "All nominees and appointees will comply with the ethical obligations of their respective agencies and offices." Divestment can be difficult to navigate. In 2017, Florida Panthers owner Vincent Viola, a billionaire, withdrew from consideration to become Trump's first Army secretary. According to The New York Times, Viola had too much difficulty untangling his financial interests. Others have been able to broker deals allowing them to cash out early. Former Exxon CEO Rex Tillerson had to work out a special $180 million retirement package with the oil giant because some of his holdings included restricted shares that hadn't been fully vested. Goldman Sachs accelerated its payout to Gary Cohn, who left the firm to become Trump's chief economic advisor, leaving him with a roughly $285 million exit package. In order to entice talent out of the private sector, the government also allows officials to defer some tax liabilities when they are directed to sell shares or other assets. Tillerson and Cohn both used this perk. So too has current Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. Government watchdogs have long expressed unease about top officials entering the government with private-sector ties. Biden advisors' ties to BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, were the subject of significant attention during the 2020 transition. Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo was once interim chief of staff to Larry Fink. Brian Deese, who was Biden's top economic aide, led BlackRock's sustainable investing before joining the Biden administration. Adeyemo agreed to recuse himself from any potential BlackRock-related business until he sold off his interests. As a political appointee, Deese's ethics agreement is not public information, though ethics-focused groups previously asked the White House to disclose it. (The White House did not respond to Business Insider's request for comment about Deese's agreement. He left the administration last year.) It remains to be seen whether the president-elect will impose additional ethics requirements as he did shortly after taking office in 2017. Trump's first cabinet was the wealthiest in modern history. His incoming team is likely to be even richer. The influx of billionaires extends from the cabinet down through US ambassadors. So far, Trump's tapped at least two additional billionaires to represent the US abroad, Houston Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta and investment banker Warren Stephens, to be US ambassadors. And that list doesn't even include the likes of Musk, who has Trump's attention without the hassle of selling off his vast interests. "He is going to have the ear of President Trump anyway, even though he's serving in an advisory capacity," Holman said of Musk. Jump to

Title: Altcoin Season 2025: A Crypto Bull Run Guide

[+] Hakan Nural/Anadolu via Getty Images) Bitcoin halving, all-time high, and altcoin season—the recipe for a bull run, or is it? First, Bitcoin's halving reduces its issuance rate, which sparks supply scarcity. After that, BTC rallies into its ATHs and is followed by a horde of pumped altcoins driven by investors who prefer higher, albeit riskier, returns. The altcoin season is then full on. Bitcoin had its most recent halving in May of this year, and soon after that, it smashed through the $100k mark—a historic milestone. Yet, the altcoin market is bleeding. Where is the usual rally? Is the golden recipe broken? The surge of institutional capital and the liquidity crunch from high interest rates, coupled with Trump’s positive yet bold take on crypto, have made one thing certain: this cycle will be unlike any we’ve seen before. Every cycle has four stages: accumulation, markup, distribution, and markdown. Even though the mechanism behind these stages is well-known, timing the market is one of the most sought-after skills. You try to predict when we enter a given stage to strategize your trades. However, even though cycles follow a predictable pattern, we must not forget the wider market context–and crypto has seen a lot in the past year. The growing presence of institutional investors in the Bitcoin market has reshaped its dynamics. Having taken 7th place as the biggest asset in the world, Bitcoin has become a new asset of choice for institutions, supported by the emergence and growth of crypto ETFs. Their increased involvement often brings greater price stability. Yet, for altcoins, it may not be good news. After all, fluctuations and big corrections redirect capital flow into altcoins. Less volatility means fewer returns that could circle back into the altcoin market. This year has been special. The launch of Bitcoin spot ETFs has brought a significant capital inflow from traditional finance onto the crypto market. Institutional inflows into these ETFs have triggered a Bitcoin supply shock, strengthening its dominance. The demand for Bitcoin caused by ETFs directly influences Bitcoin dominance, currently sitting at around 56%, a meaningful metric often overlooked by novice traders. It measures BTC's market share relative to altcoins, offering insights into whether we're in a Bitcoin season (BTC outperforms) or an altcoin season (altcoins outperform). What does a strong BTC dominance with a stable Bitcoin price mean? Altcoins dumping. And in this cycle, Bitcoin spot ETFs prolonged Bitcoin dominance. This new variable was absent in previous bull runs and will make the 2025 altcoin season undeniably unique. Bitcoin: The Cycle of Dominancce If you ask any financial executive about the most important financial metric, they’ll tell you it’s liquidity. In 2023 and 2024, the US interest rates hiked to one of the highest numbers in a long while. Even though it’s dropped from 5.25% a year ago to 4.19% now, it’s still a relatively attractive yield for a risk-free asset. On the other hand, cutting interest rates often fuels crypto bull runs for a very simple reason–they create a favorable environment for riskier assets to thrive. After all, risk-free government debt at a 0.11% yield, like in 2021, is as attractive as losing your capital due to inflation. Low rates equal cheaper borrowing and increased liquidity, which, in turn, pushes investors to park their money for higher returns. Where? Yes, you’ve guessed it. Crypto. The winning of Trump’s administration in the US has undoubtedly shaken the crypto world. The Bitcoin Act sparked a lively debate across the crypto and non-crypto circles. If passed, the Senate legislation would require the Treasury and the Federal Reserve to purchase 200,000 bitcoins annually within a period of five years to accumulate one million bitcoins. In other words–about 5% of the global supply. Needless to say, pro-crypto regulations are a very meaningful step for the widespread adoption of crypto assets, and Trump’s stance has proven to ignite a positive sentiment, with BTC hitting its ATH shortly after the future President confirmed his plans to create a BTC federal reserve. With BTC keeping its dominance, high interest rates, and pro-crypto regulations in the US, should we expect a full-blown altcoin supercycle in 2025? That’s a billion-dollar question. If history has taught us anything, it’s that altcoin pumps often follow major Bitcoin moves. Yet, estimating just how big those price movements will be - or exactly how long after Bitcoin’s new all-time highs altcoins will moon–is impossible. David Siemer, the CEO of Wave Digital Assets, says: “I don't think we'll see such a dramatic altcoin season as 2021 in the near future, meaning BTC dominance falling below 40%. But we will see a huge increase in altcoin values as BTC continues to rise.” Siemer then adds that “for alts to break out like 2021 relative to BTC, the use (adoption) and value (revenue capture) of altcoins needs to increase by many orders of magnitude”, emphasizing that it may happen in at least 3 years. But once it begins, altcoin season itself can be easily recognized because of some quite bullish signals: Cane Island Digital Research has shared in its “Proof of Altseason” findings about the seasonality of altcoin rallies, showing ETH as a proxy for altcoin to experience a bullish market. In addition, it mentions a repeated pattern of the January-May altseason period. Although the upcoming altcoin season may differ significantly from what we’re used to, certain sectors have secured their spots within the crypto space. After the $VIRTUAL token experienced a 24908.4% pump (that’s 249x), it’s safe to say that we’ve entered a new level of narrative dominance. While memecoins could outpace sectors like real-world assets or AI, AI agents are in a league of their own, often regarded as the driving force behind the next supercycle. Artificial Intelligence is still at the top of its game, and with the progress of AI agents, the onchain AI economy has garnered a big chunk of mindshare, hitting its peak at 50% in 2024, according to Kaito AI. This trend will likely follow in 2025, driven by the unprecedented demand for AI services. Institutional adoption, ignited by big names like BlackRock, has also impacted sectors like real-world assets, legitimizing tokenization as a fundamental component of the crypto world. While most of the attention is on AI and AI agents, traditional finance is exploring tokenization as a viable business option, with major banks like J.P. Morgan and Goldman Sachs trying to disrupt the financial market. As we enter 2025, we must keep several things in mind before the altcoin season. First, Bitcoin dominance is your friend, so use it wisely to time your trades. Websites like BlockchainCenter.net can help you assess whether we’re in an altcoin or Bitcoin season. What’s important to keep in mind is: The crypto market is maturing. Each cycle is a stepping stone and should be considered a learning lesson. While memecoins are still harvesting their fruits, new narratives are becoming more and more influential. But here is the most interesting part–the narratives trending right now, like AI agents, are not just passing trends. To top it all off, we now face a greater impact from macros and institutional adoption than any previous bull run. Does it mean we should expect different altcoin dynamics this time around? To some extent. We shouldn’t blindly follow the pattern from previous years, either. The question isn’t whether altcoin season will happen—it’s when and how different it will be from previous years.

Title: Citigroup joins US lenders in exiting Net-Zero Banking Alliance

(Reuters) - U.S. banks Citigroup (NYSE:C) and Bank of America said on Tuesday they are exiting the Net-Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA), a group of global banks that have pledged to curb greenhouse gas emissions. They follow Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) and Goldman Sachs, which both left the alliance earlier this month. Financial firms, historically criticized for their connections to the fossil fuel industry, have made efforts to incorporate net-zero standards more prominently into their operations. However, they have begun scaling back on some initiatives to avoid irking Republican policymakers who are opposed to limiting the financing of fossil fuels. Citi said it had made progress toward its own net-zero goals and decided to leave the NZBA. BofA, in an emailed statement to Reuters, said: "We will continue to work with clients on this issue and meet their needs." The NZBA aims to bring down carbon emissions from the lending and investment portfolios of its members to zero on a net basis by 2050. Last month, BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), Vanguard and State Street (NYSE:STT) were sued by Texas and 10 other Republican-led states, which said the large asset managers violated antitrust law through climate activism that reduced coal production and boosted energy prices.
