Title: Analysis-Investors flee thematic ETFs as stock benchmarks soar

By Suzanne McGee (Reuters) - Investors are leaving exchange-traded funds tied to specific themes, such as artificial intelligence and video gaming, as they flock to funds linked to broad stock-market benchmarks that are hitting record highs. The run for the exits, however, may slow if the broader market stumbles. While flows in equity ETFs overall continue to climb, thematic ETFs, which invest in companies tied to everything from solar energy to robotics and millennial consumers, are on pace for their third-consecutive year of net outflows, according to financial data and analysis company Morningstar. The category, which has total assets of $108 billion, has lost $5.8 billion in investor capital this year, greater outflows than the $4.8 billion for all of 2023, according to Morningstar. "It's winter for thematic ETFs right now," said Taylor Krystkowiak, investment strategist at Themes ETFs, an asset-management firm focused on this category. Returns from broad market indexes are setting a higher bar for thematic funds this year. The S&P 500, the benchmark for the U.S. stock market, has climbed over 22% this year, propelled by gains from influential stocks including Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). The five-largest ETFs tracking the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100, another equity benchmark, have seen inflows of $170 billion this year. The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (ASX:SPY) on Thursday became the first ETF to reach $600 billion in assets. "It's not that people don't like the idea of themes any longer, but that a bull market dominated by a handful of megacaps makes it hard for any theme to stand out," said Aniket Ullal, ETF analyst at CFRA, a market-research firm. BAD TIMING Part of the challenge, said Bryan Armour, ETF analyst at Morningstar, is the nature of thematic investing itself. Investors often mistime investing in themes, according to a Morningstar study that found investors in thematic ETFs missed out on two-thirds of their returns in a five-year period. "You have to pick the right theme, then be sure that the fund has picked the stocks that will benefit most from that theme, and then be right about the timing of when you buy the fund," Armour said. "Getting that trifecta right is tough." Even some AI-themed ETFs with outsized exposure to market-darling Nvidia have struggled to retain assets. The Global X Robotics & Artificial Intelligence ETF has seen net outflows of $89 million in the last 12 months, according to the firm. Despite the fund having nearly 13% of its portfolio in the AI chipmaker - almost double the S&P 500 weighting - it has performed only in line with the index, with both up about 39% in the past year. "We still have longer-term conviction in themes," said Arelis Agosto, head of thematics at Global X, which has seen outflows in 19 of its 31 thematic funds over the last 12 months. "We take a long-term view." Cathie Wood's ARK Innovation ETF, which invests in companies promising "disruptive innovation," has seen $2.6 billion in outflows in 2024, the most of the thematic ETFs, according to Morningstar. The fund is down more than 9% this year. The fact that thematic funds tend to levy higher fees can diminish their appeal. Thematic ETFs' fees average 0.62% of money invested while the average ETF fee is 0.49%. Investors pay 0.09% to own the State Street (NYSE:STT) S&P 500 ETF and 0.03% for BlackRock (NYSE:BLK)'s iShares Core S&P 500 ETF, according to Morningstar. The number of thematic launches dropped to 13 this year from 39 in 2023, while closures of thematic funds in 2024 have already topped 2023's total, with 36 compared to 32, according to Morningstar. Themes ETFs is bucking that trend, having launched 18 products since December, including a Transatlantic Defense ETF, which invests in defense companies based in NATO member states, and a European Luxury ETF, with holdings in Ferrari NV (NYSE:RACE) and Watches of Switzerland Group PLC. "I think that when S&P 500 megacaps stop delivering the way they do today, the focus will shift back to thematic ETFs," Krystkowiak said.

Title: BlackRock Bitcoin ETF records $329 million net inflows despite market retreat

Share this article BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) recorded around $329 million in new investments on Monday, even as Bitcoin’s value fell below $67,000. With the fund’s strong performance, US spot Bitcoin ETFs have successfully extended their winning streak to seven consecutive days with net buying exceeding $2.5 billion, according to Farside Investors data. Fidelity’s Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) also reported gains of approximately $6 million on Monday. In contrast, competing ETFs from Bitwise, ARK Invest/21Shares, VanEck, and Grayscale (GBTC) experienced redemptions, totaling over $40 million. The remaining ETFs saw no inflows. BlackRock’s IBIT remains a popular choice for investors seeking exposure to Bitcoin. Over $1 billion worth of net capital went into the fund last week, accounting for half of US spot Bitcoin ETF inflows. According to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, IBIT has now surpassed Vanguard’s Total Stock Market ETF in year-to-date inflows, ranking third overall less than ten months after its launch. As of October 18, IBIT’s Bitcoin holdings were valued at $26.5 billion, according to updated data from BlackRock. Despite recent price fluctuations, the sustained interest in Bitcoin ETFs suggests robust institutional engagement, although upcoming US elections and global tensions could impact market stability. Bitcoin peaked at $69,500 on Monday before retreating below $67,000. It is currently trading at around $67,400, down around 2% in the last 24 hours, per CoinGecko.

Title: Bonds Are Selling Off Everywhere as Traders Trim Rate-Cut Bets

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. (Bloomberg) -- Bonds extended losses as investors mulled the prospect of slower US interest-rate cuts, a trend that risks upending debt positions everywhere. Most Read from Bloomberg Climate Change Is Killing Buildings in Slow Motion How Kyiv Became a Leader in Digital Services Amid Wartime Strain Dhaka's Revolutionary Makeover Pits Visions of Peace Against Vengeance Drug Decriminalization Spawns a Political Debacle for Progressives A Broken Oil Pipeline Plunges South Sudan’s Capital Into Chaos The selloff pushed yields on two-year Treasuries higher by as much as two basis points on Tuesday, while 10-year yields briefly topped 4.2% for the first time since July. The rate on 10-year German securities touched the highest level since early September. The rout also spread to Asia, where the yield on Australian benchmark debt surged as much as 16 basis points. US yields subsequently retreated to little-changed levels. At the heart of the selloff lies a reassessment of the outlook for US monetary policy. Traders are paring back bets on aggressive easing given the US economy remains robust and Fed officials this week sounded a cautious tone over the pace of future rate decreases. Rising oil prices and the prospect of bigger fiscal deficits after the upcoming US presidential election are only compounding the market’s concerns. “With less than two weeks now until the US elections, concerns about the fiscal outlook and its potential upward pressure on inflation have become more acute,” said Robert Dishner, senior portfolio manager at Neuberger Berman in London. The US 10-year yield rose 10 basis points on Monday. The move steepened a part of the US yield curve that’s been inverted since late 2022, with the gap between three-month and 10-year yields reaching the narrowest level in nearly two years. “We will see 4.5% probably early next year” for US 10-year yields, said Ed Yardeni, founder of Yardeni Research, speaking in an interview on Bloomberg Television. Traders have pared the extent of expected Fed interest-rate cuts through September 2025 by more than 10 basis points since the end of last week, according to swap pricing, which implies a Fed target rate of 3.50%-3.75%. Apollo Management is among those who’ve said the central bank could keep rates unchanged at its next meeting, while T. Rowe Price sees US 10-year yields climbing to 5% next year on risks of shallower rate cuts and as growth improves. What Bloomberg Strategists say... “Treasuries may struggle in the coming months, with a strong upward bias for yields as the US economy stays resilient and supply concerns grow” Garfield Reynolds, Markets Live strategist The outlook is also being repriced across other markets. Swaps are signaling the Reserve Bank of Australia will cut its benchmark rate cut by only about 50 basis points through to the end of August next year, half of what was priced in after the September policy meeting. Similarly, traders brought forward their forecast for the next Bank of Japan rate hike to June, compared with later than July seen last month. Demand for long-term holdings of Japanese 10-year bonds, “which carry relatively high interest-rate risk, is likely to be limited” in this environment, Keisuke Tsuruta, a senior fixed-income strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities Co. in Tokyo, wrote in a research note. Not everyone expects the selloff to gain momentum. The Fed and Reserve Bank of New Zealand, among others, are in the midst of rate-cutting cycles, which should generate an underlying bid for bonds. “We probably see a slight correction from here,” said Lucinda Haremza, vice president of fixed-income sales at Mizuho Securities in Singapore. There’s “risk of a stronger rally on rising Middle-East tensions or a Harris election win,” she said, referring to the US presidential election contest between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump, the Republican candidate. For now though, the combination of US debt supply, election hedging and markets front-running the risks of a Republican “red sweep” at the polls may see larger-than-usual fluctuations in Treasuries. Treasury volatility has climbed to the highest level this year, based on the ICE BofA Move Index that tracks anticipated swings in US yields based on options. BlackRock Investment Institute is among those underweight shorter-maturity Treasuries. “We don’t think the Fed will cut rates as sharply as markets expect,” strategists at the company including Wei Li wrote in a note. An aging workforce, persistent budget deficits and the impact of structural shifts such as geopolitical fragmentation should “keep inflation and policy rates higher over the medium term,” they wrote. --With assistance from Haslinda Amin, Anchalee Worrachate and Alice Gledhill.

Title: As RTO Mandates Rage On, How Should Millennials Leaders Manage Gen Z IRL?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasminebrowley/2024/10/21/as-rto-mandates-rage-on-how-should-millennials-leaders-manage-gen-z-irl/
Time Published: 2024-10-22T02:51:30Z
Full Content:
Deandre Brown Companies like Amazon, Apple, and BlackRock are putting their foot down with remote employees in a mass mandate for them to return to the office. This will likely mean that workers of all ages will be in the same physical space together for the first time, which can spell out some challenges for leaders aiming to create healthy workplace cultures for all. This is particularly concerning for a large number of Gen Z workers who’ve had the bulk of their college and early job experiences shaped virtually due to the pandemic. Understandably, this has affected their professional progress. Per data reported by Inc., 60% of employers have admitted to firing Gen Z employees they’ve hired this year, which opens a larger conversation about widening generational gaps between the young adults and their youngish counterparts, millennials, who are likely to be their immediate supervisors. Some employers have claimed that Gen Z workers are unprofessional and lack communication skills. Despite these strong claims, Deandre Brown—a content creator and consultant that advises corporate clients on how to engage with Gen Z audiences—says the rift isn’t one-sided. “I think the onus is on both the employer and the young workers to come to a reasonable solution,” he says. Deandre Brown “I have mixed emotions about this topic,” Brown continues. Before becoming a full-time entrepreneur, he worked with Citi as a banking analyst. After noticing some challenges that his peers faced while climbing the corporate ladder, he began sharing professional tips in humorous videos on TikTok and Instagram. A short while later he amassed thousands of followers, speaking to the need for relatable work advice that targets early careerists. “I like to think of Generation Z being placed in two categories—those who really don't care about work, are lazy and don't put in an effort, which is something you see throughout any generation, by the way. But then you also see a large percentage who do care about work and progression within their company. The breakdown within this latter group is they are putting themselves first because their values differ from older work-first generations, mainly millennials.’” To his point, ironically, much like their younger counterparts, in the early aughts millennials were once pegged as lazy and uncooperative a decade ago by older generations. But data suggests they are actually one of the hardest working generations. A recent report from Team Stage says that more than a quarter of them work two or more jobs and 73% are working more than 40 hours per week. “I think that companies need to be more honest about not wanting to work with Gen Z because they demand more of them, including more diversity, fair pay and better work/life balance opportunities,” Brown says. “Instead of being willing to work with us and understand the next generation, some companies are completely writing us off and saying, ‘Well, you all aren't ready to work, so we're just not going to deal with this.’” Andrew McCaskill, a career expert with LinkedIn suggests that managers have to realize the harsh realities their young new hires have been facing and build an infrastructure to support them. Andrew McCaskill "Gen Z has spent a significant portion of their job preparation years in a COVID-Bizzarro World reality,” McCaskill says. “So, we need to give them grace, clear direction, expectations and real on-boarding support. As long as the skills are there, it’s worth the investment to help them adjust to culture.” Kristina Wilson, founder of talent acquisition consultancy KW Careers says bridging the generational gaps usually begins with companies taking the time to ask the right questions. Kristina Wilson “Workplace leaders really have to be interested and invested in understanding what motivates certain generations: where work/life balance begins, and what productivity looks like for them,” she explains. “Oftentimes Gen Z is labeled as being very entitled to a Baby Boomer or a Gen Xer. But I don't label it as such. I think that they come into the workplace with way more awareness and firmer boundaries that aim to protect their mental health capacity, diversity, et cetera. While this is admirable, I do understand how this can translate as challenging for employers if the work isn’t getting done. There needs to be a happy medium, but it takes extreme awareness on both sides.” McCaskill agrees. “New professionals have to participate in their own rescue on this one, as well,” he says. “This is one of the most competitive job markets in a decade, and they have to take professional advice from people who have succeeded at work—as opposed to people who have succeeded at talking about work on social media. Gen Z is being targeted on social media platforms with a lot of really bad career advice. The long-standing rules of workplace norms still hold true in almost every environment. New professionals should build a network of advisors who are personally rooting for them to win—mentors, former bosses or professors, people in their chosen profession. Most of the people telling you not to wear a suit for an interview or to close your laptop at 5PM on the dot—don’t make money from working a job like the one you have. They make money from saying provocative things for clicks and likes.” With that, the three experts offered some advice for millennial leaders who are managing young workers. Help them gain self-awareness “Have a conversation with Gen Z workers about the critical need to be aware of their body language, communication skills, tactics and approaches—have some diversity within that,” Wilson says. Support them in acclimating to workplace norms “Incorporating an onboarding buddy to help them understand the office norms can be incredibly helpful,” McCaskill suggests. “Managers also owe it Gen Z workers to be clear about what’s expected. Unspoken expectations are often unmet expectations. Now is the time to actually state the obvious.” Create space for them to feel heard Research suggests that Gen Z workers have very strong values that spill into the workplace, and they want to feel heard. “We need to actually listen and hear them because if they don’t feel this, they’ll disengage or walk away from the job altogether,” Brown says. “Reserving opportunities for the team members to discuss their concerns, workplace desires and grievances without shaming them is critically important. Setting up regular 1:1 check-ins is a way to do that. It goes a long way, and honestly, it will signal to them that you truly care about co-existing.” One Community. Many Voices.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. (Bloomberg) -- French investment firm Wendel has agreed to acquire a majority stake in private lender Monroe Capital for $1.13 billion to extend its reach to the booming private credit category. Most Read from Bloomberg Climate Change Is Killing Buildings in Slow Motion How Kyiv Became a Leader in Digital Services Amid Wartime Strain A Broken Oil Pipeline Plunges South Sudan’s Capital Into Chaos Drug Decriminalization Spawns a Political Debacle for Progressives Dhaka's Revolutionary Makeover Pits Visions of Peace Against Vengeance Wendel will buy a 75% stake in Monroe Capital and provide an additional $1 billion to grow Chicago-based firm’s business and seed new funds, according to a statement on Tuesday, confirming an earlier Bloomberg News report. The transaction also includes an earn-out mechanism of as much as $255 million. The deal is expected to close in the first half of next year. Founded in 2004 by Theodore Koenig, Monroe provides private credit to borrowers in the US and Canada and manages about $19.5 billion. The company has 11 offices including one in Abu Dhabi and one in Seoul. “This is a very significant and transforming deal for Wendel,” Laurent Mignon, chief executive officer of Wendel, said in a press conference. “It will increase our exposure to the US, which is a good thing because the US economy is more dynamic than Europe’s over the long term.” The deal for Monroe dovetails with Wendel’s new strategic direction announced last year. The firm has been building out a new asset management business overseeing third-party money. Family-backed Wendel has previously invested from its own balance sheet. It sold holdings in publicly-listed firms and redeployed the proceeds into private markets. It bought a majority stake in mid-market buyout firm IK Partners earlier this year. Monroe will be a great base for Wendel to launch its private credit operation in Europe, which is much less developed than in the US, Mignon said. In the short term, Wendel will focus on Monroe’s integration, but it will keep looking for opportunities in the infrastructure area and in secondary market for private equity in Europe and the US, he said. Shares of Wendel rose as much as 1.7% in early Tuesday trading in Paris, giving the company a market value of about €4.2 billion ($4.5 billion). Lucrative Business Wendel will acquire 50% in Monroe from its management and another 25% from Bonaccord Capital Partners. AXA IM Prime, a unit of AXA Investment Managers, could invest alongside Wendel as a minority shareholder. The Paris-based firm will have a path to purchase the remaining shares in subsequent transactions that would take place in three instalments over 2028 and 2032. UBS Group AG and financial-services specialist Fenchurch Advisory advised Wendel, while Monroe was advised by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. The lucrative and growing world of private credit has attracted firms including Apollo Global Management Inc., Blackstone Inc., Ares Management Corp. and Blue Owl Capital Inc. It’s also spurred acquisitions and partnerships by firms seeking to expand their reach. Last year, TPG Inc. bought credit firm Angelo Gordon for $2.7 billion. BlackRock Inc. agreed this year to buy Adebayo Ogunlesi’s Global Infrastructure Partners for about $12.5 billion in a transformational deal for the industry. Blue Owl has struck multiple deals this year, including agreeing to buy credit manager Atalaya Capital Management. BlackRock is among the firms exploring a purchase of HPS Investment Partners, Bloomberg News reported this month. Apollo has teamed up with Citigroup Inc. on $25 billion worth of private credit deals over the next five years. Lazard Inc. has also considered several opportunities to acquire a private-credit firm. --With assistance from Francois de Beaupuy, Paula Seligson, Silas Brown and Gillian Tan.

Title: What to see and do in Dublin, Ireland

National Geographic content straight to your inbox—sign up for our popular newsletters here From Temple Bar to the Book of Kells, the Irish capital has its fair share of iconic attractions, but you’ll find just as much magic elsewhere — in its thriving music scene, new breed of after-hour spaces and the coastline right on its doorstep. Dublin is a city that’s impossible to ‘do’. It has its big hits: there’s the Guinness Storehouse, where the ‘black stuff’ is brewed, tasted and revered; and there are taprooms that thump in the party district of Temple Bar. Dublin Castle sits near Trinity College, the country’s oldest and most illustrious university, which guards the Book of Kells, a treasured ninth-century manuscript. Literary giants like James Joyce made Dublin a UNESCO City of Literature and now stand alongside musicians like U2 and Sinéad O’Connor in its hall of fame — their legacy popping up across the city in street plaques, museums, former homes and studios. But Ireland’s capital and biggest city doesn’t have a huge number of defining landmarks to tick off. Which suggests something the locals will readily tell you: this is a place about the in-between moments. Take a beat, and you’ll see Dubliners weaving past their icons and legends like the city’s River Liffey around stone. You’re more likely to mingle with them in, say, the Creative Quarter, a web of independent boutiques, cafes and restaurants between South William Street and George’s Street, or inner-city districts like Stoneybatter, The Liberties and Portobello. They’ll be happy to give their take, and have their craic — the all-Irish good time, tinged with humour and wit — particularly in old-school pubs, where much of social life unfolds. No matter where you end up going in the city, you’ll notice new shots of energy alongside the old staples. Celebrated French chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten has recently opened a rooftop restaurant at The Leinster hotel, for instance — the latest in a small but fast-growing city trend. Brilliant old boozers remain, but there are also new, nichey waves of basement wine bars and ‘audiophile’ spaces pairing craft beers and cocktails with vinyl DJs and bespoke sound systems. Trinity College now runs a concert series on its cricket pitch and the Guinness Storehouse has been experimenting with after-hours events featuring the likes of DJ Annie Mac and Northern Irish electronic duo Bicep. Dublin is bisected by the Liffey, which fuels a fairly deep-rooted Northside-Southside rivalry. Its centre is tight-knit, with urban villages inside circling canals, and you’ll find flickers of Viking and medieval heritage (like sections of the old city wall, church crypts or throwback names like Winetavern and Fishamble) between Georgian squares and street murals. All of this makes it a place best explored on foot, taking the odd tram, taxi or bus. It can take a minute to get your bearings — but, all things considered, in a place where so much can be found where you don’t expect it, that’s hardly a downside. Dublin is a city that’s impossible to ‘do’ — so just dive in. 1. Book of KellsThis millennia-old Gospel book, crafted by Celtic monks and world-famous for its intricate illustrations, is displayed in Trinity College’s Old Library. A new, immersive experience complements the visit: admire the manuscript behind a glass case — the pages are flipped every day — then continue through a pavilion that brings it to life with holograms, 360-degree audio-visual displays and more hi-tech wizardry. 2. Behind the scenesNear O’Connell Bridge, Abbey Theatre has been at the centre of Irish cultural life for 120 years. Tours take visitors into the wings and back of house to prop vaults and dressing rooms. In the southside suburb of Ringsend, there’s a similar backstage feel on the Windmill Lane Recording Studios tour — U2, Van Morrison and Sinéad O’Connor are just some of the icons who’ve left their mark here. 3. Croke ParkMany cities have stadium tours, but few are like this one. In Dumcondra, a 15-minute walk from the city centre, Croke Park is Grand Central for hurling and Gaelic football (also known as GAA), the country’s biggest spectator sport. You can book an all-areas tour, strap in for skyline views from its roof or visit a museum explaining the GAA’s place in Irish community life. Better still, buy a ticket for a game. 4. Museum magicIreland’s national museums and galleries are free to visit. See Viking gold and grisly bog bodies at the National Museum of Ireland – Archaeology on Kildare Street, then pop around the block to the National Gallery of Ireland. 5. 14 Henrietta StreetExperience more than 300 years of Dublin life at this social history museum set in a restored townhouse. Its rooms are staged as they would have looked in different eras, connecting the stories of those who’ve called this address home, from images of Georgian grandeur to tales of tenement squalor. The visit ends at a restored 20th-century flat, complete with stocked shelves and the smell of carbolic soap. Guided tours only. 6. Tune inDublin’s music scene is on a high, with young local musicians like Lankum, CMAT and Pillow Queens making global headlines. Catch the next big thing while they’re still small at venues like Whelan’s on Wexford Street or the Button Factory in Temple Bar. Or sample trad music at The Cobblestone in Smithfield, a short Luas (tram) ride west of O’Connell Street. 1. Powerscourt Townhouse CentreThe courtyard of this Georgian townhouse was once a car park. Today, it houses a boutique shopping centre with a mix of independent cafes and shops. Try the bacon and pear sandwich at The Pepper Pot, then browse interiors at Article, set in the townhouse’s former dressing room. 2. Sweny’sStep inside this former pharmacy near Trinity College and you’ll enter Edwardian Dublin. The space is now a volunteer-run bookstore, but it’s still crammed with mahogany counters, glass cabinets and medicinal vials. It was featured in Ulysses; a lemon soap bar, as chosen by Leopold Bloom in the novel, is a great souvenir for devotees of James Joyce. 3. Om DivaDrury Street is a small but satisfying shopping strip with craft, design and second-hand stores, as well as speciality cafes and restaurants. It’s here you’ll find this trove of vintage and affordable clothing, the brainchild of Ruth Ní Loinsigh, a household name of the Dublin fashion scene. The first floor is a hub for emerging talent. 1. Coke Lane PizzaThe Coke Lane Pizza team serve up Neapolitan-style slices at Lucky’s and The Circular, two neighbourhood bars located respectively in The Liberties and Rialto. Try a Magnum PI, topped with wood-fired ham hock and Teeling Whiskey-flambéd pineapple — it’s ‘100% guilt-free’. 2. The Winding StairBrowse this bistro’s ground-floor bookshop, then follow the staircase up to a little dining room overlooking the River Liffey and Ha’penny Bridge. It’s a Dublin classic thanks to its homely air, wooden tables and local food — such as a charcuterie board with salami from The Wooded Pig, a family-run farm an hour’s drive north of the city. 3. LiathLiath means ‘grey’ in Irish, but this 14-seater restaurant in Blackrock — some 15 minutes south of the centre by bus or train — is anything but. Its seasonal tasting menus have seen it net two Michelin stars; an autumn line-up might include pigeon with raspberry preserve and trompette mushroom. 1. Wren Urban NestHere’s a carbon-neutral, uber-central option. The compact, entry-level ‘snug’ rooms pair Scandi-inflected minimalism with smart storage nooks. In the basement, bar and restaurant Alt does weekend brunch with a buffet selection of charcuterie and homemade cakes, plus bottomless mimosas. 2. Number 31This 21-room hotel is a warm, witty counterpoint to cut-and-paste city chains. It combines a Georgian townhouse with a modernist garden mews, and each room is individually decorated with fin-de-siecle and art deco flourishes. Breakfast is at communal tables; don’t miss chef Delia Bracken’s cranberry bread, baked fresh on site and much-loved by repeat guests. 3. The ShelbourneSet across several Georgian townhouses, Dublin’s grand dame is celebrating its 200th anniversary this year. It’s hosted a ‘who’s who’ ranging from Grace Kelly to the Rolling Stones, but what really sets this hotel apart is the presence of locals at its bars and lounges. A room overlooking St Stephen’s Green is worth the stretch. 1. BreadMan WalkingGerry Godley opens the door to his central home-turned-microbakery every Saturday between 12pm and 3pm, allowing customers to pick pastries, bread and cakes straight from the oven. Pre-order by direct message on Instagram and you’ll be sent the address in return. You can’t go wrong with a brioche tasting box. 2. Bar hopSkim several Dublin drinking scenes by booking a trail of central basement bars. Kick off with a pint at The Merrion Hotel’s 18th-century brick vaults, then saunter over to wine bar Cellar 22 for a glass of sustainable Riesling and wind up with a seaweed-infused old fashioned at Blind Pig, a speakeasy-style cocktail bar. 3. Dublin Coastal TrailRunning from Skerries, in the north of the county, to Killiney, in the south, this new, 40-mile coastal trail links 11 seafront villages and takes in medieval castles, cliff walks, watersport locations and craft shops. It’s accessible from the city centre by the DART rail system and Irish Rail. On a sunny day, opt for the Bleeper Bike share scheme, available at several stops along the way. 1. Grogan’s Castle LoungeIn a city famous for its traditional pubs, this option near the Irish Whiskey Museum is worth your time. It has strip-wood-panelling, tasselled lamps and a rotating gallery of amateur art on the walls. Come for a creamy Guinness and a simple but tasty ‘special’ — a ham, cheese and tomato toastie served with Colman’s mustard. 2. FidelityDublin has a new wave of audiophile bars pairing bespoke sound systems with craft drinks, slick design and an indie ethos. Fidelity in Smithfield is the standout, featuring a curving marble counter, retro hi-fi speakers and a DJ booth with vinyl decks. For alternatives, look to The Big Romance on Parnell Street and Bootleg on Drury Street. 3. Lumo ClubRun by Dublin DJ and promoter Niall Byrne, of music blog Nialler9, this is a super-inclusive club night that’s ‘about classics and curveballs’ — everything from pop and electronic to Phil Collins and Italian disco duo La Bionda. It takes place monthly at small, central venues like The Workmans Club in Temple Bar or Yamamori Tengu, on the opposite bank of the Liffey.

Title: Children with scoliosis offered surgery in United Kingdom and New York
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/health/2024/10/22/children-with-scoliosis-offered-surgery-in-united-kingdom-and-new-york/
Time Published: 2024-10-21T23:01:00Z
Full Content:
The Department of Health has offered families of children with severe paediatric spinal conditions such as scoliosis the option of treatment in big hospitals in the UK and in New York as part of a drive to dramatically lower the number of patients waiting for longer than four months for procedures. Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly will tell the Cabinet on Tuesday that the number of patients on the active waiting list for longer than four months by the end of 2024 will fall to 20, down from 86 at the start of the year. Mr Donnelly will bring detailed projections to Cabinet on the actions being taken regarding numbers awaiting urgent treatment. On Tuesday, the Government is also expected to agree to begin the process of drafting an Occupied Territories Bill that would ban goods or services in Ireland that are connected to unlawful Israeli settlements in the Occupied Territories. Minister for Foreign Affairs Micheál Martin will seek Cabinet approval for a review that could create a “legal pathway forward”. However, Mr Martin said on Monday it was unlikely that the Bill would be drafted before the general election. On scoliosis surgery, Mr Donnelly is expected to say that reductions in surgical waiting times are being achieved despite an increase in additions to the surgical list due to significantly higher numbers of outpatient clinics being held. He will also note new initiatives to ensure that the backlog is reduced and children receive faster access to care. Patients are now being offered treatments abroad in Morgan Stanley Children’s Hospital in New York, Great Ormond Street Hospital in London and Portland Hospital UK. A total of 20 patients are confirmed for treatment abroad, as of September 2024, some of whom have already had surgery. Any child who travels abroad will be given a comprehensive support package which includes flights (with the child and one adult funded to travel in business class and another adult also covered to travel), accommodation, travel insurance and funding to cover expenses. Children’s Health Ireland (CHI) and the National Orthopaedic Hospital Cappagh is projected to carry out 557 procedures in 2024, an increase of 93 compared to 2023. Initiatives are also under way at the Mater hospital and Blackrock Clinic. The Minister is expected to tell his Cabinet colleagues that some children are still waiting too long for care, but that any child on the active wait-list for longer than four months after Christmas (who is clinically suitable) will, in consultation with their treating clinician, be offered surgery overseas. He said CHI had confirmed to him that the additional surgeons and staff being hired would ensure enough surgical capacity to meet the needs of the service in future, once the current backlog is addressed. The waiting times of children with severe spinal conditions waiting for life-changing operations have long been a matter of political controversy. In 2017, Simon Harris, who was then minister for health, gave a commitment that no child would wait more than four months for spinal surgery. The target was not achieved. In 2022 Mr Donnelly allocated €19 million in funding to ensure that no child would wait longer than four months. It later emerged that CHI did not earmark all the funds to reduce waiting lists with some of the money being spent elsewhere.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 8 Best Communication Stocks To Buy According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Pinterest, Inc. (NYSE:PINS) stands against the other communication stocks. The communication sector seems to be performing well through this year as the sector ETFs are slightly outperforming the broader market. While XLC and VOX are up over 25% year-to-date as of October 17, the S&P has gained slightly over 23%. Chris Grisanti, chief market strategist at MAI Capital Management also sees significant opportunities in the tech and communications sector despite him being a value investor. READ ALSO 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In He told CNBC on October 17 that the economy appears to be in very strong shape, with positive earnings reports from financial companies. Economic indicators are looking solid, and the upcoming election could have a positive effect regardless of the outcome. Moving forward, the strongest earnings are likely to come from technology and communication stocks, despite them typically being outside value-focused investments. According to PwC’s Media and Telecommunications: US Deals 2024 Midyear Outlook, media and telecommunications deal activity remained subdued due to high interest rates and uncertain regulations, with deal volumes declining despite a slight rebound in values in 1H 2024. Consumer preferences are shifting towards short-form, user-generated content platforms like TikTok, where influencers play a significant role in attracting brand partnerships. Streaming platforms are evolving through bundling and partnerships to manage rising content costs while improving subscriber retention. AI, especially generative AI, is increasingly influencing content creation and ad tech, which are making campaigns more efficient and optimizing ad spending. Private equity investors are showing renewed interest, especially in consumer-focused deals, although regulatory obstacles and privacy concerns continue to complicate the market. As companies navigate these challenges, maintaining a strong consumer value proposition is crucial to retaining subscribers and driving growth. Our Methodology For this article, we identified over 40 communications services stocks with a market cap above $10 billion through the Finviz stock screener. Next, we narrowed our list to 8 stocks most favored by analysts. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their average price target upside as of October 17. We also mentioned the hedge fund sentiment around each stock which was taken from Insider Monkey’s Q2 database of 912 elite hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

A young, stylish woman using her smartphone to find inspiration for her latest DIY project. Average Price Target Upside: 33.58% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 61 The fourth best communication stock to buy on our list is Pinterest, Inc. (NYSE:PINS). It is a visual search platform where users discover, save, and act on ideas across several interests. The company has around 500 million active users globally and the platform is popular among women and Gen Z. It monetizes through ads, offering various formats like standard images, video, shopping, carousel, and interactive ads. Ads are served through an auction system, which are optimized for either brand awareness or conversions. AI and machine learning improve ad delivery, which in turn, improve performance for advertisers. The platform also provides tools for campaign management and measurement and helps brands assess their ad effectiveness. The company’s advertising appeals to brands across multiple industries, offering custom solutions based on their goals. Tipranks reported that on October 2, Wells Fargo analyst Ken Gawrelski reaffirmed his Buy rating on Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) due to several positive factors. He expects the company to achieve around 20% revenue growth, with the stock trading at a favorable valuation below 12 times the projected 2026 EBITDA. Gawrelski believes the company will surpass the upper end of its Q3 revenue guidance and beat consensus-adjusted EBITDA estimates, which show margin expansion. The analyst also views the company’s improvements in ad load and the release of the AI-driven Performance+ product. The analyst expects steady Q4 growth and controlled expenses, with optimism that a housing market recovery will boost engagement. Moreover, The Fly reported that KeyBanc analyst Justin Patterson raised Pinterest’s (NYSE:PINS) price target from $43 to $45, maintaining an Overweight rating. The firm expects stronger-than-expected Q3 revenue and profitability due to a solid ad market and favorable currency movements. Despite macro uncertainty and a shorter holiday season, KeyBanc expects Pinterest's product cycles will support continued growth into 2025. ClearBridge Mid Cap Strategy stated the following regarding Pinterest, Inc. (NYSE:PINS) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “Selection in the communication services sector also weighed on performance, primarily driven by a decline in Pinterest, Inc. (NYSE:PINS), which operates a social media platform where users can express their interests and discover ideas through images they “pin” to their pages. Having been a strong contributor in the first half of the year, the company gave back some of its gains as investors captured gains and an uptick in economic uncertainty pushed out spending by leading advertisers. We capitalized on this weakness to add to the position, as we believe that several of its internal initiatives to increase the monetization of its users and become a better value-added advertiser to its customers are coming to fruition.” Overall PINS ranks 4th on our list of the best communication stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of PINS as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than PINS but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: CareMax draws $5 million under loan amid financial strain
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/company-news/caremax-draws-5-million-under-loan-amid-financial-strain-93CH-3674057
Time Published: 2024-10-21T21:32:49Z
Full Content:
CareMax, Inc. (NASDAQ:CMAX), a provider of nursing and personal care services, has tapped into a $5 million loan to cover short-term operating expenses, as disclosed in a recent SEC filing. The transaction, carried out today, involved drawing funds under an existing credit agreement with Jefferies Finance LLC and other lenders. The Miami-based company, which operates under the healthcare sector with a focus on nursing and personal care facilities, is actively seeking ways to alleviate its capital strain. Efforts include cutting operating costs and exploring strategic alternatives such as refinancing and asset sales. Despite these actions, there's an acknowledgment of the possibility of a Chapter 11 bankruptcy restructuring if the company fails to stabilize its finances. CareMax's current financial situation, characterized by net losses, high indebtedness, and substantial cash used in operating activities, raises concerns about its ability to continue as a going concern. The company's ability to comply with its debt covenants and to successfully execute its strategic plans, including asset divestitures, remains critical. CareMax's stock is listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC, along with its warrants. The company's financial maneuvers and strategic plans, as stated in the filing, are essential for investors to monitor as they assess the company's future prospects. This report is based on statements from a press release. In other recent news, CareMax, Inc. has made significant strides in managing its financial obligations. The company has reached an agreement with its lenders, including Jefferies Finance LLC and BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) Financial Management, to extend the waiver on certain defaults under its credit agreement until various dates in 2024. This extension provides CareMax with additional time to address these defaults. In a strategic move to strengthen its balance sheet, CareMax has secured a $20 million credit facility, which includes a $4 million term loan and an additional $16 million available through delayed draw term loans. Despite challenges impacting its adjusted EBITDA, CareMax met its full-year revenue targets and membership goals. Analysts from Jefferies and UBS have adjusted their price targets for CareMax. Jefferies maintained a Hold rating but lowered the price target to $3.00, while UBS maintained a Neutral rating and revised its price target to $6.40. Recent InvestingPro data paints a challenging picture for CareMax, Inc. (NASDAQ:CMAX), aligning with the financial struggles outlined in the article. The company's market capitalization has dwindled to just $7.24 million, reflecting investor concerns about its financial health. InvestingPro Tips highlight that CareMax is "quickly burning through cash" and "operates with a significant debt burden," which directly relates to the company's need to tap into a $5 million loan for short-term operating expenses. The tip that "short term obligations exceed liquid assets" further underscores the liquidity issues mentioned in the article. The company's financial performance is concerning, with a negative gross profit margin of -3.31% in the last twelve months as of Q2 2024, and an operating income margin of -17.33% for the same period. These figures support the article's mention of net losses and high indebtedness. Despite these challenges, InvestingPro data shows a significant return of 20.25% over the last three months, suggesting some investor optimism or speculative interest. However, this should be viewed in the context of a 97.22% price decline over the past year. For investors seeking a more comprehensive analysis, InvestingPro offers 8 additional tips for CareMax, providing a deeper understanding of the company's financial situation and market position.

Title: Grandfather Who Was Jailed Over Anti-Immigration Protest Found Dead.

Skip to comments. Posted on 10/21/2024 2:02:03 PM PDT by george76 A grandfather imprisoned for two years and eight months for taking part in an anti-immigration protest in Rotherham, England, has been found dead in His Majesty’s Prison (HMP) Moorland. Peter Lynch, 61, carried a placard asserting politicians, police, journalists, and others had been corrupted by the World Economic Forum (WEF), BlackRock, Vanguard, and others at a protest outside a hotel hosting illegal immigrants following the deadly stabbing of three young girls in the town of Southport, allegedly by a migration-background teenager. The courts admitted Lych’s placard and protest were not unlawful. Still, they chastised him for having “a general conspiracy theory against anyone and any form of authority” and alleged his “racist and provocative” verbal abuse of riot police crossed the line into illegality. ... Body camera footage from the day of the protest shows Lynch, a heart attack survivor, telling riot police they “are protecting people who are killing our kids and raping them.” Rotherham is an infamous hotspot for Muslim grooming gang abuse, with working-class white girls being groomed, raped, and pimped by predominantly Muslim men of Pakistani heritage for years while local authorities refused to act for fear they would be accused of racism. The circumstances of Lynch’s death are under investigation, but sources say he appears to have taken his own life. As anti-immigration protesters were being sentenced, Comcast-owned Sky News previously reported sources saying, “Any right-wing, far-right protester landing up in jail, well, they can expect a pretty cold reception from… [South] Asian gangs inside prison who will be looking out for them.” Muslims officially account for 6.7 percent of Britain’s population, but they account for around 18 percent of prisoners, and they are now the dominant force among the prison population.

Title: Genesys confidentially files for US IPO
URL: https://www.itnews.com.au/news/genesys-confidentially-files-for-us-ipo-612515?utm_source=feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=iTnews+Software+feed

Genesys has confidentially filed for an initial public offering in the United States, becoming the latest tech firm to bet on the booming AI market to attract investors. The move comes as the IPO market recovers with investors once again turning warmer towards tech startups that they had shunned for over two years due to concerns around lofty valuations. Genesys, an AI-driven developer of call centre software, did not reveal any details about its IPO or a timeline for going public, but a September report from Bloomberg News citing sources said the company could raise as much as US$2 billion ($3 billion) in the offering. In December 2021, Genesys raised US$580 million in a funding round led by Salesforce Ventures, valuing it at US$21 billion. Other investors in the round had included Zoom Video Communications, D1 Capital Partners and funds and accounts managed by BlackRock. Genesys was acquired by private equity firm Permira Holdings from Alcatel-Lucent in 2012, valuing the company then at about US$1.5 billion. Hellman & Friedman invested about US$900 million in the company in 2016 for an equity stake. The company's cloud platform fetched over US$1.6 billion in revenue in the second quarter of its fiscal year 2025, more than 35% higher than last year driven by AI demand, it said in September. Genesys added that accelerated customer adoption of standalone AI products contributed to more than 10 percent of the bookings of its cloud business during the first half of the fiscal year. AI play Analysts expect companies catering to the artificial intelligence market to lead the charge for tech sector listings, amid heightened expectations of multi-fold growth over the next few years as corporates increasingly find more generative AI use cases. "While there's always a risk of a down-round IPO, companies that have leveraged AI effectively, as Genesys has done, might have a chance to exceed or at least match their previous valuation," said Joe Endoso, CEO of private investment platform Linqto. "The fact that they filed confidentially might also suggest they're testing the waters to gauge investor appetite, making this a litmus test for broader market sentiment toward AI-driven businesses and the tech sector as a whole." Genesys operates in over 100 countries with more than 6000 employees, according to its website. Its partners include tech giants Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, Microsoft and Adobe. Its customers span across the technology, retail and industrial sector, and include British airlines Virgin Atlantic, India's Axis Bank and consumer electronics giant Lenovo. Cerebras Systems, a startup competing with industry leader Nvidia for a slice of the lucrative AI chip market, also filed for a US IPO late last month. "If these listings perform well, it would signal that the market has a strong appetite for AI-driven growth, encouraging other companies in the sector to accelerate their plans for going public," Endoso added.

Title: Michael Saylor Triggers BTC Community with "Paranoid Crypto Anarchist" Statement

Time Published: 2024-10-21T17:30:24Z
Full Content:
U.Today - Michael Saylor, founder of MicroStrategy, shared a link to a fresh interview of his. One curious statement he made about BTC owners who prefer to keep their private keys to themselves over lack of trust in the government drew the attention of the crypto community since, in this statement, Saylor was somewhat critical of them. Extracts of this interview have been separately published on X by other crypto enthusiasts. One of the statements that caught the attention of the Bitcoin community was the statement made by MicroStrategy’s Saylor about those who prefer self-custody to hedge funds like BlackRock (NYSE:BLK). Madison Reidy’s question about this was if there are any risks posed on those people who prefer to hold Bitcoin with custodians and whether it increases the risks of having their Bitcoin confiscated and seized by the U.S. government in the future. Here, she made a historical reference to the Great Depression, when the government confiscated gold from wealthy American citizens. In 1933, during the Depression, President Roosevelt announced that gold holders should turn their gold bullion and coins in and get $20.67 per ounce in return. Back then, the U.S. dollar was on the gold standard, and after collecting the gold, Roosevelt raised the price per ounce to $35. The gold inflow from holders and the printing of dollars that followed was one of the radical measures that allowed the U.S. to steer out of the Depression. Saylor claimed that only “paranoid Bitcoin anarchists” fear that Bitcoin can be seized from them, and he claimed that gold was not seized in 1933 but turned in voluntarily. Since the U.S. is not on the Bitcoin standard, he said, there is nothing to be afraid of. The community was stunned by these words, reacting strongly in the comments.

October 21, 2024 13:30 ET | Source: ARC Capital Venture, LLC ARC Capital Venture, LLC CHICAGO, Oct. 21, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ARC Capital Venture LLC has highlighted a renewed wave of investor optimism in the U.S. fixed income market, driven by positive economic indicators and a growing belief in the Federal Reserve’s ability to guide the economy toward a "soft landing." With inflows into fixed-income assets reaching record highs, this revival underscores the strength and stability of bonds as a viable investment strategy. The latest data shows that leading financial institutions, including BlackRock, JPMorgan Chase, and Pimco, have experienced unprecedented growth in their bond portfolios. In the third quarter alone, U.S. bond funds saw an impressive $123 billion in inflows, with $93 billion directed towards exchange-traded funds (ETFs). These figures reflect the renewed confidence of investors who are seeking reliable returns and a hedge against potential stock market volatility. ARC Capital has observed similar trends among it’s clients, many of whom are shifting from cash savings to fixed income, recognizing bonds as a key component of their portfolios. This trend is largely fuelled by the Federal Reserve’s recent easing of interest rates and the broader realization that high-quality bonds provide essential diversification in periods of economic stress. “The current bond market is demonstrating remarkable resilience and appeal,” said Nicos Kezarides, Chief Executive Officer at ARC Capital Venture LLC. “We’re seeing more investors re-enter the fixed-income space as interest rates decline, with bonds offering competitive yields that are particularly attractive compared to traditional savings products. This environment is creating an ideal opportunity for investors to benefit from the stability and potential returns offered by bonds.” The market's positive momentum is further supported by the fact that, despite global uncertainties, major financial institutions have continued to report strong inflows. Pimco, for instance, recently reached $2 trillion in assets under management for the first time since 2022, marking a significant milestone for the bond giant. As the Federal Reserve continues to adjust its policies, ARC Capital anticipates that the fixed-income market will see sustained growth, particularly for longer-duration bonds that offer attractive yields in a normalized rate environment. The broad appeal of both active and passive bond strategies underscores the democratization of fixed-income investing, making it accessible to a wider range of investors. “Bonds are increasingly being seen as a crucial tool for portfolio diversification, and we expect this trend to accelerate as the economy stabilizes,” added Nicos Kezarides. “At ARC Capital, we are committed to helping our clients navigate this evolving landscape, providing them with the insights and investment opportunities needed to succeed in the fixed income space.” For more information on ARC Capital services and market insights, please visit www.arc-capital.com or contact our team at info@arc-capital.com.

Title: World's largest investment managers see assets hit $128 trillion in return to growth

NEW YORK, Oct. 21, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Total assets under management (AUM) at the world's 500 largest asset managers reached USD 128.0 trillion at the end of 2023, according to new research from leading global advisory, broking and solutions company WTW's (NASDAQ: WTW) Thinking Ahead Institute. Despite not yet reaching 2021 levels, this amounts to 12.5% annual growth and marks a significant recovery from the major correction the year before (AUM dropped by $18 trillion in 2022). The research also reveals the continued evolution of active vs. passive assets under management among the largest investment managers. For the first time, passive investment strategies now account for more than one third of AUM among the 500 largest firms (33.7%), though this still leaves almost two thirds of assets managed by the world's largest managers in active strategies. Asset class allocations have also evolved, with renewed growth of private markets. Core equity and fixed income remain the dominant asset classes, comprising 77.3% of total AUM (48.3% equity and 29.0% fixed income). However, this marks a slight decrease of 0.2% compared to the previous year, as investors turned to alternatives such as private equity and other illiquids in search of returns. Partly down to the recent dominance of US equities as performance drivers, North America experienced the largest growth in AUM with a 15.0% increase, followed closely by Europe (including the U.K.) with a 12.4% rise. Japan saw a slight decline, with AUM decreasing by 0.7%. As a result, North America now accounts for 60.8% of the total AUM in the top 500 managers, with USD 77.8 trillion at the end of 2023. At the very top of the rankings, U.S. managers make up 14 of the top 20, and account for 80.3% of the assets of the top 20. Turning to individual asset managers, the research shows that BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) remains the world's largest asset manager, with its assets now above $10 trillion once more. Vanguard Group holds a strong second place at almost $8.6 trillion AUM and both remain significantly ahead of Fidelity Investments and State Street (NYSE:STT) Global “ ranked third and fourth respectively. Notable risers in the full rankings in the last 5 years include Charles Schwab (NYSE:SCHW) Investment, up 34 places to reach 25th place from 59th place. Geode Capital Management, also U.S. based, is up 31 places to reach 23rd place from 54, while Canada's Brookfield Asset Management (TSX:BAM) is up 29 places from 60th to 31st. Asset managers have experienced a year of consolidation and change. While there has been a return to strong market performance, the last year has also seen forces of change, said Jessica Gao, director at the Thinking Ahead Institute. Macro factors have played a key part in the story, with notable highs in interest rates during 2023 exerting varied pressure on different asset classes, geographies and investment styles. As this now gradually switches to a rate cutting environment, equity markets are beginning to return positive performance also driven by improving expectations of earnings growth. Uncertainties looking ahead are now focused on geopolitical events and several major elections. We have continued to see net flows into passive strategies as they continue to offer a compelling value proposition, particularly in terms of lower fees and simplicity. Yet growing market volatility and issues with concentration, which typically highlights the need for expertise to outperform benchmarks, may be a source of caution from some allocators to passive market trackers. Meanwhile, asset managers continue to face major pressure to evolve their own business models. Investment in technology remains essential not just to maintain a market edge, but also to meet evolving client requirements and expectation in reporting and customer service. Increased competition, fee compression, and the growing demand for more personalised, technology-driven investment solutions are challenging traditional structures. We have witnessed notable successes of independent asset managers versus many of the more affiliated insurer-linked vs bank-linked asset managers, concluded Gao.

This group brings together the best thinkers on energy and climate. Join us for smart, insightful posts and conversations about where the energy industry is and where it is going. Post EDF's energy experts discuss how to accelerate the transition to a clean, low-carbon energy economy. Guided by science and economics, EDF tackles urgent threats with practical solutions. Founded... By EDF Blogs By Maaz Haider As the world grapples with the increasing frequency and intensity of natural disasters, the impacts of climate change have become a tangible concern for millions of people. Among the largest contributors to this crisis is transportation, the largest source of U.S. emissions, and medium- and heavy-duty vehicles have an outsized impact. Hence, reducing transportation emissions is essential. Transitioning to zero-emission trucks will slash climate and air pollution everywhere, improve local economies by creating new jobs, strengthen national security by reducing our dependence on imported oil, and save fleets money on fuel — all of which are especially critical now. Charging ahead: Key reasons for confidence in a commercial EV trucking future Share on X While uncertainties remain about the ultimate pace of scaling zero-emission medium- & heavy-duty vehicles, this presents an opportunity for innovative partnerships. By working together to address challenges, we can accelerate the transition to zero-emission trucks and reinforce the transportation sector’s commitment to a sustainable future. Infrastructure improvements: The backbone of EV success The industry has made significant strides in developing charging infrastructure to support electric trucks. Private investment, as well as support from government programs, is beginning to address the infrastructure challenge. Fueled by public and private funds, there are now around 183,000 public charging ports in operation within the U.S. as of Q2 2024–well on target to meet Biden’s administration goal of half a million public ports by 2030. The funds allocated under the Bi-Partisan Infrastructure Law through the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program and the Charging & Fueling Infrastructure Discretionary Grants program are actively being awarded and implemented. Three charging sites in New York, Ohio and Pennsylvania are already operational under NEVI, with 47 additional projects announced under CFI, which will deploy over 5,000 Level 2 chargers and more than 600 Level 3 fast chargers. Efforts led by other private groups solidify the future of public charging in the country. Notably, Forum Mobility will be deploying 1,000 DC fast chargers in California. Furthermore, Greenlane, a partnership between Daimler, NextEra Energy and BlackRock, to develop a nationwide network of high-performance charging stations starting with a 280-mile corridor between Los Angeles and Las Vegas. Recently, a group of carriers and shippers, which includes AIT Worldwide, DB Schenker, Maersk, Microsoft, PepsiCo and others, have formed a coalition to pilot heavy-duty charging with Terawatt Infrastructure along the I-10 corridor. Technological advancements: Breaking the range barrier and demonstrating reliability and performance Advancements in battery technology continue to improve the capacity of electric trucks, including adding range and reducing charging times. Legacy manufacturers like Daimler and Freightliner, along with new entrants such as Nikola, Tesla and Windrose, are leading the charge in electric truck innovation, offering impressive ranges on a single charge. Tesla’s Semi truck promises a range of up to 500 miles with PepsiCo, one of the early adopters of the Semi, having successfully integrated these trucks into its fleet for regional distribution. Real-world data from Pepsi’s deployment has successfully accomplished a 1000+ mile journey in a single day. Further data revealed by NFI which also piloted the Tesla Semi’s reveals impressive efficiency statistics surpassing performance expectations and highlighting the vehicle’s long-range capabilities. Another new entrant in the market is Windrose with their EV trucks offering upwards of a 400-mile range at full load. As per the Zero-Emissions Technology Inventory, or ZETI, tool there are currently 21 different OEMs, or Original Equipment Manufacturers, offering 24 different EV van and truck models with a range of 200+ miles. Financial incentives and operational savings: The economic argument While the sticker price of electric trucks is higher compared to traditional diesel trucks, as per BloombergNEF’s New Energy Outlook 2024, due to battery cost reduction and efficiency improvements, zero-emission trucks’ cost parity can be reached even sooner with the urban duty cycle becoming cost competitive before 2030. Furthermore, subsidies and tax breaks under the Inflation Reduction Act and public grants can help offset the upfront capital costs. Specifically, IRA provision 45W allows fleets to reduce the cost of an electric truck by up to $40,000, while provision 30C enables savings of up to 30% on the cost of installing charging infrastructure. Moreover, the total cost of ownership savings outlook for electric trucks is further amplified due to savings on fuel and maintenance. Titan Freight Systems demonstrated these cost savings for medium-duty and heavy-duty trucks in a presentation at the ACT Expo 2024 showcasing 10% and 7% savings in these applications respectively. The savings will increase as more EVs are deployed since the cost of existing charging infrastructure will be spread across a larger fleet Make like bamboo: From laying the groundwork to rapid growth and advancement The growth of EVs and charging infrastructure in the U.S. can be likened to the growth of a bamboo shoot. After years growing deep roots with little visible growth above ground, bamboo suddenly shoots up rapidly, symbolizing how foundational work leads to swift, visible progress. Similarly, the EV industry initially experienced slow adoption, focused on building the necessary technology, regulatory frameworks and consumer awareness. However, with these strong foundations now in place, thanks to policies like the Inflation Reduction Act, NEVI, and other initiatives, the industry is experiencing rapid growth, much like bamboo’s sudden upward shoot. According to the EDF Electric Fleet Deployment & Commitment tracking tool commercial EV deployments grew 5 times with more than 10,000 Class 2b-8 EVs deployed in 2023 followed by more than 15,000 EVs deployed year to date in 2024. The EV industry’s steady groundwork is enabling companies in the U.S. to quickly expand their EV truck fleets, making significant strides toward sustainable transportation.

Bitwise CEO pointed out that Ethereum ETFs are among the top 25 fastest-growing new ETPs this year despite their slow start. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley has explained why he believes recently launched spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have seen significantly lower trading volumes and inflows compared to their Bitcoin counterparts. In an Oct. 21 post on X, Horsley acknowledged that Ethereum ETFs have underperformed but pointed out that the funds from his firm, BlackRock and Fidelity, are still among the top 25 fastest-growing new ETPs this year. SoSoValue data shows BlackRock’s ETHA has attracted $1.45 billion in net inflows, while Fidelity’s FETH and Bitwise’s ETHW have seen inflows of $498 million and $321 million, respectively. Overall, data shows that the Ethereum ETFs have experienced negative flows of approximately $500 million thanks to the significant outflows from Grayscale Ethereum Trust and the tepid demand for the other ETH funds. Horsley highlighted several reasons behind Ethereum ETFs’ slow start, explaining that one key factor that impacted the products was the timing of their launch. According to him, the Ethereum ETFs launched during the summer, a traditionally slow investment period during which investors monitor market activity rather than take on new projects. He furthered that the Ethereum ETFs debuted in a relatively flat market, while Bitcoin ETFs entered the scene during a bull market, which drew more attention and investment. Horsley noted that many investors were still focusing on Bitcoin when Ethereum ETFs launched, making it difficult for Ethereum to capture the spotlight. He explained: “For many traditional investors, some time has been and continues to be needed to figure out how to incorporate Bitcoin after the launch of the ETPs. Ethereum arriving before that was solved, made it hard to turn attention to it.” Horsley also addressed concerns about whether the lack of the staking feature was significantly impacting the Ethereum ETFs. The Bitwise CEO stated that he doesn’t believe the lack of staking yield is a significant issue, noting that most ETH holders aren’t currently staking their assets. However, Horsley highlighted the success of Bitwise’s European franchise, which offers a fund (ET32) that provides exposure to Ethereum while capturing staking rewards. He said this fund has been “growing nicely,” and a similar feature would benefit the US-based funds. Staking is a critical element of Ethereum’s proof-of-stake (PoS) system, where users lock up their Ethereum to validate transactions and earn rewards. However, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has expressed concerns that staking services may qualify as unregistered securities offerings and has taken legal actions against crypto platforms like Kraken. The ETF issuers unsurprisingly excluded staking from their funds in response to these legal risks. Despite these challenges, Horsley emphasized that it’s too early to judge Ethereum ETPs’ long-term potential. He believes “the story for Ethereum ETPs is just beginning.” Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

Title: Why Are Spot Ethereum ETFs Underperforming? Bitwise CEO Reveals
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-etfs-underperforming-bitwise-ceo/
Time Published: 2024-10-21T14:00:11Z
Full Content:
The launch of spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has not met the high expectations set by their Bitcoin counterparts, leading industry experts to analyze the underlying reasons. Since their inception on July 23, all spot ETH ETFs have seen outflows of $463 million, according to Farside Investors data. The main culprit is Grayscale’s ETHE with $2.996 billion in outflows, while BlackRock has $1.258 billion and Bitwise $321 million in inflows. Hunter Horsley, CEO of Bitwise Asset Management, took to X to shed light on the factors affecting the performance of the US spot Ether ETFs. “Why didn’t the Ethereum ETFs do better? A question I got at an event last week,” Horsley began. “First, how do you judge success? The ETPs from iShares, Fidelity, and Bitwise are all in the top 25 fastest growing new ETPs this year,” he added. Despite their position among the fastest-growing exchange-traded products (ETPs), Horsley identified several factors that worked against the successful launch of spot Ethereum ETFs. He noted that the timing of the launch during summer, a typically slow period for investors who “monitor but don’t take on a lot of new projects,” may have dampened immediate interest. Additionally, the market conditions played a role: “Bull markets always draw focus. Bitcoin ETPs launched amid a rising Bitcoin. Ether ETPs launched in a sideways market.” The lack of bullish momentum in Ethereum’s price may have contributed to the tepid response. Furthermore, the sequential launch of Ethereum ETFs following Bitcoin ETFs may have overwhelmed investors still acclimating to cryptocurrency assets. “For many traditional investors, some time has been and continues to be needed to figure out how to incorporate Bitcoin after the launch of the ETPs. Ethereum arriving before that was solved made it hard to turn attention to it,” Horsley explained. Nate Geraci, President of The ETF Store and co-founder of the ETF Institute, highlighted the broader success of crypto-related ETFs in 2024. “Update… Out of 525 ETFs launched in 2024, 13 of top 25 are either bitcoin or ether-related. 14 if you include MSTR Option Strategy ETF. Top 4 ETFs all spot btc. 5 of top 7 crypto-related. I call this masterpiece ‘no demand’.” Related Reading: Ethereum Founder Buterin Lays Out Possible Futures For ETH Protocol In response, Christopher Perkins, President of CoinFund, suggested that yield-generating products could enhance appeal. “Yield would help. Total return ETH is the killer product,” he stated. Horsley acknowledged the value of staking but downplayed its immediate impact on ETF performance. “Agree, ET32 has been growing rapidly in our Europe franchise,” he replied. However, Horsley also added, “I don’t think lack of staking yield is a huge issue. Most of ETH today is owned directly so could be staked, yet ~2/3 don’t. But agree it’s valuable. We have an ETH ETP with staking in Europe that’s growing nicely.” Industry veteran Dan Tapiero, founder and CEO of 10T Holdings, remained optimistic about the future of spot Ethereum ETFs. “Just wait. They’re gonna do just fine,” he asserted. Horsley concurred, simply stating, “Agree.” At press time, ETH traded at $2,705. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: Why Bitcoin? Michael Saylor breaks down BTC’s edge over gold, stocks!
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/why-bitcoin-michael-saylor-breaks-down-btcs-edge-over-gold-stocks/
Time Published: 2024-10-21T12:30:45Z

Saylor delves into why Bitcoin is the most powerful network and the preferred choice. Bitcoin’s [BTC] impressive rise last week has renewed investor optimism, especially after exchange-traded funds (ETFs) crossed the $20 billion inflows milestone. However, concerns are growing as more of BTC’s supply becomes concentrated in the hands of a few large institutions. This has led to questions about whether this centralized control increases the risk of seizure or confiscation, similar to what happened with gold in 1933 under Executive Order 6102. MicroStrategy Executive Chairman Michael Saylor addressed these concerns in a recent interview on Markets with Madison. He argued that unregulated private holders are at a greater risk of seizure. Yet, this risk decreases when BTC is held by regulated entities like BlackRock, JP Morgan, and Fidelity. Additionally, Saylor suggested that lawmakers are unlikely to support any moves that could threaten these institutions. He pointed out, “That’s where all their retirement money is invested.” The exec also highlighted the benefits of Bitcoin being held by regulated entities, including reduced volatility and a lower risk of loss. Speaking of potential risks, quantum computing is emerging as a threat to current cryptographic systems, including public-key cryptography. This raises the question: Will Bitcoin be able to withstand this new challenge? Well, Saylor remained quite optimistic. The CEO acknowledged that as computers evolve and become more powerful, the network will strengthen its defenses. He emphasized the robustness of the king coin, stating, “Bitcoin is the most cyber-resistant, the most powerful digital network on Earth. It’s the hardest thing to hack.” With trillions of dollars at stake, Saylor expressed confidence that those most incentivized to protect their money will ensure the latest technology is implemented into the Bitcoin network to safeguard it. Meanwhile, the comparison of Bitcoin with traditional assets, as well as other cryptocurrencies, has been a topic of continued debate. So, what makes BTC a strong contender in this race for superiority? According to Saylor, BTC’s unique origin story and decentralized nature set it apart. He referred to Bitcoin’s launch by its anonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, as an “Immaculate Conception”—free from personal gain or central control, a feature that distinguishes it from other cryptocurrencies. Saylor argued that Bitcoin’s appeal lies in the fact that, “All the smart money in the world decided that’s the winner.” This assertion is evidenced by increasing institutional interest, including MicroStrategy’s own. As per the latest data from Bitcoin Treasuries, MicroStrategy held 252,220 BTC, worth approximately $17.42 billion. This substantial investment reflects Saylor’s continued confidence in Bitcoin’s potential as the superior digital asset.

Title: Genesys confidentially files for US IPO as AI boom drives demand
URL: https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/genesys-confidentially-files-us-ipo-ai-boom-drives-demand-4692266
Time Published: 2024-10-21T12:21:56Z

Business REUTERS/Aly Song :Genesys said on Monday it has confidentially filed for an initial public offering in the United States, becoming the latest tech firm to bet on the booming AI market to attract investors. The move comes as the IPO market recovers with investors once again turning warmer towards tech startups that they had shunned for over two years due to concerns around lofty valuations. Genesys, an AI-driven developer of call center software, did not reveal any details about its IPO or a timeline for going public, but a September report from Bloomberg News citing sources said the company could raise as much as $2 billion in the offering. In December 2021, Genesys raised $580 million in a funding round led by Salesforce Ventures, valuing it at $21 billion. Other investors in the round had included Zoom Video Communications, D1 Capital Partners and funds and accounts managed by BlackRock. Genesys was acquired by private equity firm Permira Holdings from Alcatel-Lucent in 2012, valuing the company then at about $1.5 billion. Hellman & Friedman invested about $900 million in the company in 2016 for an equity stake. The company's cloud platform fetched over $1.6 billion in revenue in the second quarter of its fiscal year 2025, more than 35 per cent higher than last year driven by AI demand, it said in September. Genesys added that accelerated customer adoption of standalone AI products contributed to more than 10 per cent of the bookings of its cloud business during the first half of the fiscal year. AI PLAY Analysts expect companies catering to the artificial intelligence market to lead the charge for tech sector listings, amid heightened expectations of multi-fold growth over the next few years as corporates increasingly find more generative AI use cases. "While there's always a risk of a down-round IPO, companies that have leveraged AI effectively, as Genesys has done, might have a chance to exceed or at least match their previous valuation," said Joe Endoso, CEO of private investment platform Linqto. "The fact that they filed confidentially might also suggest they're testing the waters to gauge investor appetite, making this a litmus test for broader market sentiment toward AI-driven businesses and the tech sector as a whole." Genesys operates in over 100 countries with more than 6,000 employees, according to its website. Its partners include tech giants Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, Microsoft and Adobe. Its customers span across the technology, retail and industrial sector, and include British airlines Virgin Atlantic, India's Axis Bank and consumer electronics giant Lenovo. Cerebras Systems, a startup competing with industry leader Nvidia for a slice of the lucrative AI chip market, also filed for a U.S. IPO late last month. "If these listings perform well, it would signal that the market has a strong appetite for AI-driven growth, encouraging other companies in the sector to accelerate their plans for going public," Endoso added.

Title: Starwood slashes 50pc from value of Dublin office loans to Blackstone as challenges persist

Starwood provided finance to Blackstone in 2020 to buy Dublin office properties The Iveagh Court in Dublin was among the original portfolio of 12 offices acquired by Blackstone A unit of property investment group Starwood has slashed the value of loans held over a number of prime Dublin offices by 50pc as the market continues to be severely challenged by the fallout from the pandemic. It suggests the value of the properties themselves could be even more deeply discounted. The offices are owned by US private equity giant Blackstone. It bought a number of prime Dublin offices in 2020 from Starwood, which in turn provided funding to Blackstone to help fund the acquisition. Starwood secured its loan over a total of 12 properties in Dublin. At the time of Blackstone’s €535m purchase of the Dublin offices, the portfolio of properties included the Iveagh Court, the Watermarque Building, 29-31 Adelaide Road and 75 St Stephen’s Green. They extended over a combined 600,000-plus sq ft of space and apart from office space included some retail units and 45 residential units. The remaining portfolio now includes seven properties, following some asset sales in 2021 and 2022. Starwood European Real Estate Finance, together with subsidiary Starwood Property Trust, provided finance for the sale to Blackstone, by participating in 50pc of the mezzanine loan amount and giving the Starwood group a net commitment of just over €35.1m. As of the end of September this year, the outstanding balance was €25.9m, secured against the remaining seven properties. Starwood European Real Estate Finance told investors during the summer that the underlying assets are “well tenanted, albeit certain assets are expected to require capital expenditure to upgrade to Grade-A quality to retain existing tenants upon future lease expiry events”. It added at the time: “The loan remains in compliance of its third-party senior loan facility and the group’s mezzanine loan facility, however given the persisting challenging market dynamics, the group is working closely with the sponsor, a very large institutional asset manager, and a leading global valuation and advisory firm to identify future capital expenditure needs, funding sources, exit values and the business plan to exit.” Since then, Blackstone has provided new operational updates and the Starwood European Real Estate Finance board has evaluated “various business plan scenarios and the uncertainty related to these scenarios”. “As a consequence of this new information, combined with the challenging local office market dynamics, the board has determined to provide for a 50pc impairment of the company’s loan, equivalent to €12.9m,” it told investors on Monday. “Nevertheless, the board and the investment adviser consider that there are a wide range of possible outcomes whereby the loan may have a lesser or greater degree of recovery due to the ongoing uncertainty related to the various business plan scenarios,” it added. “The investment adviser will be actively managing the position to maximise the opportunity for value recovery.” As of the end of August this year, Starwood European Real Estate Finance’s net asset value (NAV) was £203.7m and NAV per share was 105.02 pence. After adjusting for the impairment of the Irish office loan, the adjusted NAV is £192.8m and adjusted NAV per share is 99.43 pence as of the end of August. The vacancy rate in the Dublin office market remains high, despite signs of improved demand for high-grade offices from tenants this year. The vacancy rate is 18pc when so-called grey space, or sub-lets from existing tenants, is included. Join the Irish Independent WhatsApp channel Stay up to date with all the latest news

Title: U.K. Pension Giant L&G Looks to Enter Crypto's Tokenization Space

Election 2024 coverage presented by Legal & General (L&G), the London-headquartered pension and investment management firm with $1.5 trillion in assets under management, is plotting an entrance into the blockchain-based tokenization space that's growing popular among finance giants. Tokenization – or the representation of conventional assets like U.S. Treasuries-backed money-market funds via tokens on a blockchain – has become popular among traditional finance firms. That accelerated after the arrival of BlackRock, the largest asset manager in the world, on the scene with its BUIDL fund on the Ethereum blockchain. Others are available from Franklin Templeton, State Street and Abrdn. “We are evaluating ways to make the Legal & General Investment Management Liquidity funds available in tokenized format,” said Ed Wicks, global head of trading at Legal & General Investment Management (LGIM), when asked about the firm’s plans via email. “Digitization of the funds industry is key to improving efficiency, reducing cost and making a broad range of investment solutions available to a wider range of investors. We look forward to continued progress in this space,” Wicks said. L&G’s dalliance with blockchain technology stretches back to 2019, when the insurer said it planned to use the managed blockchain system from Amazon Web Services (AWS) to manage and record bulk annuities for its insurance business. LGIM is the asset management arm of L&G. Edited by Nick Baker.

Title: Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) Collaborates with Databricks on Generative AI, Aiming for Competitive Edge in Cost and Performance with AWS

We recently compiled a list of the 15 AI News Investors Should Not Miss. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other AI news investors should not miss. According to Ark Invest, an investment manager focused on disruptive technologies, artificial intelligence breakthroughs are expected to increase the share of the global equity market associated with disruptive innovation from 16% to 60% by 2030. With inflation transitioning to deflation in several sectors, the firm believes that five innovation platforms, namely robotics, energy storage, AI, blockchain, and multi-OMIC (biological analysis) sequencing will be profoundly impacting macroeconomic metrics over the next few years. “Interest rates are likely to surprise on the low side of expectations, broadening the equity rally from a narrow subset of stocks and reinforcing the need for diversified AI investments.” -Catherine Wood, CEO and CIO Read more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities. One of the firm's ETFs with the investment theme of next-generation internet outperformed broad-based global equity indices in the third quarter, benefiting from its holdings in companies involved in innovative technologies. The year-to-date performance of the fund is 16.81%, outperforming its category by 1.59 percentage points year-to-date. In light of this trend, joining CNBC’s “The Exchange”, technology reporter Kate Rooney revealed how Wall Street is trying to cash in on the AI craze using AI itself. According to Rooney, the new world of generative AI is starting an “arms race for hedge funds”. Modern versions of AI today are better than human traders in ways more than one. They learn from mistakes and get smarter along the way, and they ultimately require minimal human intervention. Combining this with the rise of OpenAI and Anthropic, these “off-the-shelf” models tend to be cheaper. Moreover, while human traders may be capable, they often succumb to emotions and tend to make mistakes. This is why Intelligent Alpha CEO Doug Clinton believes that a “lack of emotion” is actually the edge or “superpower” of AI. That said, the program revealed how hedge funds are now looking into AI to “get ahead of the markets”, where their use of AI will ultimately help them improve decision-making in the field. Companies like OpenAI and Anthropic, which have raised significant capital along the way, ultimately need enterprise clients to scale, and Wall Street is an ideal fit due to its reliance on data and analysis. Intelligent Alpha has launched a first-of-its-kind ETF named after famed stock trader Jesse Livermore. The ETF uses OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Anthropic’s Claude, and Google’s Gemini to construct a global equity portfolio. As per Clinton, firms that get on board with AI could gain an edge with a price tag of millions of dollars. “What it does is it adds some intelligence to indexes, which are just definitionally sort of a set of rules that can’t be smart. And they also take that emotion out of the active side where human beings are still making decisions, but we get caught up. You know, we make mistakes and sometimes those compound. And so I think by fixing those two issues, AI has the potential to really capture a lot of value in terms of assets flowing to these new AI-powered funds.” - Intelligent Alpha CEO Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Unsexy AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.

Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.com Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 61 Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) is an American multinational digital communications technology conglomerate corporation offering a vast portfolio of technology innovations. The company has integrated AI-powered capabilities across many of its products, introduced a $1 billion fund earlier this year to invest in AI startups, and even maintains a strong foothold in cybersecurity, offering AI-powered security tools, and much more. On Wednesday, October 16, Citigroup analysts upgraded the stock to “Buy” from “Neutral” and raised the price target to $62 from $52 per share. This reflects an estimated 15% upside from Tuesday’s close. According to Citi analysts, investors shouldn’t overlook the artificial intelligence potential of Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO). The upgrade in the networking company’s shares by analyst Atif Malik highlights a narrowing valuation gap relative to peers, as well as a rapidly expanding AI Ethernet total addressable market that is projected to reach $10 billion by 2025. “While AI is currently a small piece of the biz (~2% of revs), we see the potential for a stronger contribution,” he wrote. “With more AI coming, we are incrementally more constructive on the group and expect continued investor rotation out of semis/hardware into networking equipment to benefit group valuation.” Furthermore, the addition of the company’s products in Meta Platforms’ AI hardware comes as a “positive validation of CSCO’s technology.” With at least three major hyperscalers already using its tools in their backend networks, Malik believes that the company’s $9 billion 2027 hyperscaler AI opportunity forecast may be “potentially understated”. The analyst has also increased his earnings per share estimates for 2025 and 2026 by 2% and 5%, respectively. “We believe shares warrant a sizable discount to networking peer valuation to reflect lingering share loss concerns, somewhat tempered by growing AI opportunities. Even at a 30+% discounted target multiple to peer average, we see meaningful upside to shares”. Overall CSCO ranks 8th on our list of AI news investors shouldn't miss.

IBIT has amassed over $22.49 billion in net inflows since its debut, according to data from Farside Investors. Also, Wednesday proved to be a fruitful day as most Bitcoin ETFs posted impressive positive flows. The spot BTC ETFs scooped about $458.5 million in net inflows, and no ETF posted negative net flows for the day. Fidelity’s FBTC closed the day with net inflows of $14.8 million, while Bitwise’s BITB recorded $12.9 million in net inflows.

U.Today - Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, briefly reached highs of $69,000 before retreating. In Friday's trading session, the largest cryptocurrency reached a high of $69,000, its highest level since July 29, when Bitcoin last traded at $70,000. At the time of writing, BTC was up 0.17% in the last 24 hours to $68,277 and up 9% weekly. Bitcoin's (BTC) ongoing price comeback might have prompted global investors to seek exposure to exchange-traded products (ETPs) linked to the leading cryptocurrency as seen in a remarkable increase in inflows. In particular, U.S.-listed spot ETFs have seen a strong uptake, pulling in $2 billion in investor money in the week just concluded, according to Arkham Intelligence. In a major milestone, On Oct. 18, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) authorized applications from the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) to list the much-awaited options for spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This is the largest ETF week since March, indicating a revived interest and confidence in Bitcoin among institutional investors. Bitcoin ETFs were initially approved in the United States in January. The top contributors to this large inflow include BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), Fidelity, ARK Invest and Bitwise. BlackRock led the push in Bitcoin acquisitions, adding a staggering $1.14 billion to its holdings. Other significant players in the ETF space also ramped up their Bitcoin acquisitions: Fidelity boosted its holdings by $319 million; ARK Invest added $306 million while Bitwise increased its Bitcoin portfolio by $150 million. Bitcoin reached an all-time high of $73,797 in March after soaring for weeks amid optimism on demand for Bitcoin ETFs. The price then fell by more than 30% by early August, before commencing on the present bull market run. This article was originally published on U.Today

Title: How Will Bitcoin ETF Options Impact Bitcoin’s Price?

Samara Cohen, Chief Investment Officer of ETF and Index Investments at Blackrock, walks in Times ... [+] Square after ringing the opening bell as Bitcoin Spot ETF's are launched on the Nasdaq Exchange. (Photo by Stephanie Keith/Getty Images) Last month, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) granted approval to Nasdaq ISE to list and trade options on Blackrock’s iShares Bitcoin Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), marking a significant step toward bringing regulated bitcoin options to the U.S. market. Although most retail investors who own bitcoin will not utilize this financial instrument, its availability in the U.S. may impact the adoption, liquidity, and volatility of bitcoin. This development promises to further ingrain bitcoin into the global financial system and support continued growth of the bitcoin network – and will forever change the way bitcoin is utilized as a part of an overall investment portfolio. Similar financial instruments have been available for a while, but until now they have only available on platforms outside the U.S., like Deribit. However, the approval from the SEC for IBIT options means that investors in the U.S. will have access to these contracts within a regulated framework. The U.S. has long been considered the leader in global finance, boasting the largest and most liquid equity and debt markets, with a wide range of financial instruments and a diverse investor base. By approving bitcoin ETF options in these markets, regulators will allow bitcoin investors unprecedented access to robust financial tools to manage risk and exposure. And, as institutional players like hedge funds and pension funds begin using bitcoin options, liquidity in the market will naturally increase, making it easier for large-scale trades to occur without destabilizing the asset’s price. Bitcoin options are contracts that give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell bitcoin at a predetermined price within a certain time frame. For institutional investors, these options provide a means to hedge against price volatility or to speculate on market movements without needing to hold the underlying asset. With options trading, investors can now hedge their bitcoin exposure more effectively or amplify potential returns through leverage. This flexibility may attract a wider variety of participants, offering new ways to approach bitcoin price exposure without directly buying the asset itself. In the future, regulated bitcoin options in the U.S. may lead to significant growth in its synthetic notional value, which refers to the total value of outstanding derivative contracts in the market. As options trading expands, the notional value tied to bitcoin could increase substantially, without requiring physical bitcoin to be bought or sold. This opens up a new avenue for market engagement while amplifying bitcoin’s influence in the global economy. IBIT options will be subject to existing ETF option trading rules, including criteria around listing, margin requirements, and trading halts, ensuring they integrate seamlessly into the broader financial system. The approved rule includes strict position and exercise limits, capping positions at 25,000 contracts. This limit is notably conservative compared to other ETFs – some of which have limits as high as 250,000 contracts – and was designed to minimize the risk of market manipulation. Additionally, the SEC and Nasdaq ISE have implemented robust surveillance and reporting mechanisms, ensuring that trades are carefully monitored for any signs of fraud or manipulation. The regulatory framework also includes access to surveillance from the CME’s bitcoin futures market, providing real-time oversight that tracks both the futures and spot markets, which are highly correlated. These options will be physically settled and follow the American-style exercise method, meaning they can be exercised at any point before their expiration. Bitcoin options offer a sophisticated way to manage risk and hedge exposure to its volatility. A common hedging strategy involves purchasing put options, which give you the right to sell bitcoin at a predetermined price (the strike price) within a specific time frame. This allows you to protect against a potential decline in bitcoin’s price. For example, if you hold a significant amount of bitcoin and grow concerned about a short-term price drop, you could buy a put option. If bitcoin's price falls below the strike price, the put option can be exercised, letting you sell the bitcoin at the higher strike price and limiting your losses. On the other hand, call options are used to hedge missed opportunities or upside potential. By buying a call option, you secure the right to buy bitcoin at a specified price if its market value rises, allowing you to participate in gains without fully exposing yourself to the asset’s volatility upfront. Both of these strategies allow you to manage your bitcoin positions more precisely, without being forced to sell the underlying asset in a downturn or miss out on potential profits during upward trends. Improved liquidity resulting from the introduction of bitcoin ETF options will have an effect on the volatility of its price. When a market has higher liquidity, larger trades can occur without significantly affecting the price of the asset. This is because more liquidity means there are more buyers and sellers available at any given time, which dampens the effect of any single transaction on the overall market. In the context of bitcoin, options provide institutional investors with tools to hedge their positions or take on exposure in a controlled manner, leading to more frequent but less disruptive trading activity. Additionally, the presence of options increases the number of market participants, each utilizing different strategies, from hedging to speculation, which adds layers of complexity to price discovery. As a result, liquidity is more evenly distributed across the market, reducing sharp price swings driven by low-volume trades. The SEC’s approval of bitcoin ETF options is a signal that bitcoin is gaining traction within the regulated financial system. As institutions gain more access to regulated financial products that include bitcoin, it will continue to mature and integrate into the financial system. With institutional adoption ramping up, the path forward for bitcoin looks bright. As more funds and institutional players enter the options market, bitcoin’s liquidity and market stability will likely improve, making it a more attractive asset for conservative investors. This will amplify the influx of institutional capital, further smoothing out bitcoin’s historically wild price swings, encouraging even greater participation.

Title: Cork SHC Final: Imokilly’s final-quarter blitz ends Sarsfields stay as champions

There was a brief yahoo from the stands at the final whistle, but no pitch invasion or dam burst of emotion. Imokilly, a powerful divisional team composed of junior and intermediate players from east Cork, have many admirers but not many invested followers. With a clinical second-half performance they won their sixth county title, dethroning last year’s winners Sars, and dominating the final just as they had lorded the knock-out phase of the championship in recent weeks. Playing with the gale, Imokilly rattled off 10 points without reply in the final quarter, crushing what remained of Sars’ resistance. The defending champions led by just six points at half-time, and even if it was impossible to estimate how much the gale was worth, six points felt like a cocktail umbrella in a storm. In the event they were on the sharp end of a 15-point swing. As a divisional team Imokilly cannot represent Cork in the Munster club championship, and in recent weeks a debate about the continued desirability of divisional teams in the Cork championship has surfaced again. At the moment Imokilly are incredibly powerful with an array of players with intercounty pedigree, past and present. Ciarán Joyce, Cork’s brilliant centre back, was imperious in the Imokilly half-back line. Séamus Harnedy, who had a resurgent season with Cork, thundered into the game in the second half. Elsewhere on the field were Bill Cooper, Brian Lawton and John Cronin, all of whom had played senior championship for Cork. The heart and lungs of the team, though, are seven or eight young players who had won Under-20 All-Irelands with Cork in recent years. Among them was the man of the match, Jack Leahy, who was terrific in the corner and racked up 11 points, three from play. Outside him, Diarmuid Leahy is an emerging player who will surely play for Cork in the National League in the new year. For a divisional team, though, the unity in the group is undeniable. “People are saying all year, ye’re only a division,” said Joyce afterwards, “but literally, tonight, when we’re going out we’re like a club, we all get on very well. Even at half-time we were only saying to ourselves how great we get on. It showed in the second half there, we were fighting for every ball like we’re a club.” In the end, Sars couldn’t hold back the tide. Their half-time lead was wiped out 10 minutes into the second half, and they did exceptionally well to still be level 10 minutes later. Imokilly’s goal, though, three minutes into the second half, changed the tone of the game. Daniel Kearney was dispossessed by Cooper, 30 yards from his own goal, and with no covering defenders in his path, Adam Murphy had an unimpeded run. His finish was high and fierce. Overall, the conditions were a menace. A gale blew towards the Blackrock end, extending the scoring zone to about 100 metres. Eoin Davis, the Imokilly goalkeeper, had a wide from a puck-out in the second half, and shortly afterwards landed a free from just outside the D. The uprights at both ends swayed like backing singers. There must have been a strong case for postponement, but that decision would have been complicated by the significant number of Imokilly players still involved in unfinished championships with their clubs. One of the original selling points for the split season was that the latter stages of county championships would be played out in kinder weather, but October has turned into a treacherous month, and county finals all over the country are routinely stalked by the colour card of weather warnings now. Sars played with the elements in the first half, but they struggled to get into a rhythm with their shooting and reached half-time with more wides, 12, than points, 11. Conor O’Sullivan and Paul Leopold, their two corner backs, both scored without having to stray far from home. Sars had eight different scorers in the first half, but they failed to threaten a goal when they really needed something to give an adrenaline shot to their scoring rate. Having won the toss Imokilly decided to play against the gale in the first half, and trailing by just 0-11 to 0-5 at the break, that gambit had paid off. “It was fairly manageable with that wind,” said Joyce. “Obviously we knew the quality we had in the dressingroom. We’re star-studded at the moment so we knew we’d get over the line. It’s all about confidence, these type of games.” Sars failed to score for 13 minutes in the final quarter, and in that time Imokilly put the game to bed. Shane Hegarty scored twice inside a minute to give Imokilly the lead for just the second time with 10 minutes left and from there they took flight.

Title: Bitcoin Dominance Overshadows Several Important Crypto Trends
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2024/10/20/bitcoin-dominance-overshadows-several-important-crypto-trends/
Time Published: 2024-10-20T17:45:44Z

Bitcoin's market dominance is at the highest levels in years Bitcoin continues to march toward all-time-highs that were only reached earlier in 2024, although the volatility that the token has experienced in the run-up to the U.S. Presidential election has been elevated when compared to prior periods in the year. Regardless of the volatile rise, the fact remains that the price of bitcoin and bitcoin interest continues to move in positive directions in spite of short-term setbacks. Alongside the growing interest and investment into the crypto sector by both major political parties the crypto sector has experienced an upswing in price, trading volume, and investor sentiment. As has occurred during previous bull markets, a rising tide in the crypto sector at large has led to a re-establishment of bitcoin dominance and leadership. Specifically, the share of total market capitalization captured by bitcoin, used to determine the dominance of bitcoin has risen to approximately 60% as of October 2024 which is the highest level since April of 2022. Following the declines in crypto prices overall in 2022 – and bottoming out with the collapse of FTX in November 2022, the market share of bitcoin has continued to steadily increase since those events. In addition to the market capitalization aspect of market leadership it is worth pointing out that the institutional inflows and interest coming into crypto have continued to be centered around bitcoin. For example, while both bitcoin and ether have spot ETFs products at this point, the bitcoin ETFs have attracted $18.9 billion while ether ETFs have attracted a substantially lower amount. Given all of that investors might be surprised to learn about several other major developments in the crypto sector. Let’s take a look at a few of the headlines that market watchers might have overlooked. With the rising price of bitcoin, the steady inflows into spot bitcoin ETFs, and the fact that legislation has been put forward advocating for a strategic bitcoin reserve it would be relatively straightforward for investors and policymakers to relegate stablecoins to the back burner. Doing so, however, would be ignoring a slice of the cryptoasset sector that continues to not only grow in market capitalization, but also would ignore a potential on-ramp for millions of new crypto users. USDT and USDC continue to dominate the stablecoin sector, with the former retaining its position as the largest and most commonly used stablecoin and the latter continuing to rank among the most trusted cryptoasset by the TradFi community. Despite doubts connected to business models, the ability to the issuing institutions to weather higher interest rates, and the looming potential of a CBDC stablecoins continue to represent the crypto of choice for users seeking to utilize crypto as a medium of exchange, as on on-ramp to crypto for non-expert investors, and as the crypto of choice for TradFi institutions looking for exposure in the crypto space. These facts exclude the reality that PayPal, a payment processor with household name recognition in the U.S. and abroad, has launched a stablecoin and is allowing individuals and merchants to buy, sell, and hold cryptoassets, including PYUSD. Spot crypto ETFs were a goal that crypto advocates, investors, and entrepreneurs and the approval of both bitcoin and ether ETFs in the same calendar year was – justifiably so – seen as a major victory for the crypto sector. That said, bitcoin spot ETFs introduce several tax considerations unique to cryptocurrency and its classification by tax authorities. With a Bitcoin spot ETF, investors may face capital gains taxes when they sell shares, similar to other ETFs. However, since the ETF holds actual Bitcoin, additional complexity arises regarding cost basis tracking for the fund's transactions, specifically as the coming changes to the IRS code make crypto tax reporting and compliance both more complicated and costly. Another challenge is the taxation of in-kind redemptions, where Bitcoin might be delivered directly to investors, triggering taxable events. Moreover, the frequent fluctuations in Bitcoin prices can lead to short-term capital gains, which are taxed at higher rates than long-term gains. In addition, investors should take into account the implications of international tax laws if the ETF is traded abroad, as crypto regulations and tax treatments vary by country. One of the most under-discussed trends of the recent crypto bull market has been how the centralization of crypto, and bitcoin specifically, has continued unabated and how it has accelerated in many cases. Even as the announcements and launches of bitcoin related or even bitcoin adjacent products and services propel the price per token to higher levels, the reality is the supply of bitcoin, bitcoin sentiment, and the crypto market overall continue to become centralized. Punctuating this reality are the actions taken by nation states such as El Salvador and Bhutan, which are both accumulating strategic reserves of bitcoin, the moves by global financial services leaders such as Blackrock and Fidelity into the bitcoin space, and the appetite that bitcoin tradeable products has fulfilled for investors. Centralization was always going to be a component of mass market adoption, but proponents of nation-state strategies for bitcoin should be wary of undermining one of the core tenets and appeals of the asset. Bitcoin has reestablished itself as the leading cryptoasset, but these dominance levels can overshadow important trends for crypto investors.

And then there were none. The last unbeaten record in Division 1A of the Energia AIL ended when Clontarf were beaten 28-10 at Castle Avenue by a dominant Terenure. In another meeting between the big four of the last few seasons, Lansdowne beat champions Cork Con 27-10. Harrison Brewer, Adam Melia and Jordan Coughlan, as usual, revelling on home turf, were at their best as Terenure roared into an 18-0 lead thanks to tries by Henry McErlean and Chris Cosgrave before coughing up an intercept try. Winger Craig Adams finished a superb strike move from a scrum on their own 22 instigated by the footwork and offload of Leinster’s Austrian academy out-half Casper Gabriel and another try-scoring assist by Adam La Grue. The visitors were disappointed not to add a bonus point try in the last half-hour, meaning Clontarf stayed top by a point. A feature of the day was the contributions of so many players returning from the Emerging Ireland tour, for example, the Charlie Tector show at the Aviva backpitch. Although reinventing himself as a centre with Leinster, the ex-Ireland under-20 outhalf enjoyed his return to 10, scoring 22 points with two tries and five kicks from five. Yet Leinster scrumhalf Cormac Foley was man of the match for the way he controlled the match. Captain Jack Cooke also scored as they roared into a 17-3 interval lead and as their excellent defence kept Con at arm’s length they were also a little disappointed not to register a bonus point. The other three games were all decided by kicks in the last minute. Conor Rankin held his nerve to convert a second maul try by Clayton Mulligan to seal Ballynahinch’s 26-25 win away to Young Munster while the St Mary’s centre Mick O’Gara and UCD outhalf and captain James Tarrant earned 25-22 wins at home to Garryowen and away to City of Armagh. The top-of-the-table 1B clash enabled Old Belvedere to move top with a 32-31 win at newly promoted Nenagh Ormond. Corinthians’ amalgam of recent and prospective under-20 internationals were at their free-flowing best as they, Cashel and Instonians maintained their perfect records in 2A. Orin Burke finished off two of Corinthians’ four first-half tries after flurries of offloads and sidestepping before 6ft 10in lock Bryan Walsh beat five defenders in a barnstorming 35-minute charge to score their sixth of seven. Next Saturday Corinthians host Instonians, who have won 38 of their last 40 AIL matches, one of the two exceptions being in Corinthian Park last season. Division 1A: City of Armagh 22 UCD 25; Clontarf 10 Terenure College 28; Lansdowne 27 Cork Constitution 10; St. Mary’s College 25 Garryowen 22; Young Munster 25 Ballynahinch 26.

Title: Report: Donald Trump Puts Migration First in Final Days of 2024 Campaign
URL: https://www.breitbart.com/2024-election/2024/10/20/donald-trump-leads-with-migration-in-final-days-of-2024-campaign/
Time Published: 2024-10-20T13:09:14Z
Full Content:
Donald Trump is taking a political risk by centering migration — not the nation’s economy — in his two-week dash to the ballot box, says the New York Times. “In the final weeks of a campaign …. Mr. Trump is going with his gut, doubling down on the rhetoric that he believes won him the 2016 election and using immigration and the border to form the core of his closing message to voters,” the newspaper reported October 19. Migration ‘“beats out the economy” with voters, Donald Trump told his October 15 rally, the newspaper said. “It’s not even close.” Immigration and the economy are wrapped together, Trump’s campaign told the newspaper: Asked to explain Mr. Trump’s focus in the closing days of the race, a Trump spokesman, Brian Hughes, said: “President Trump rightfully recognizes that Kamala Harris’s porous border is at the heart of so many issues, whether it is high housing prices, low wages or overwhelmed hospitals and schools. An open border means that taxpayer dollars are wasted on illegal immigrants, instead of benefiting citizens. President Trump’s closing message is all about putting Americans first and restoring prosperity.” The Times reporters did not mention that Kamala Harris’ 2024 economic platform requires a huge inflow of migrants. A Democratic-leaning advocacy group, for example, predicted she will import 12.3 million migrants during the next four years. Amazingly, Harris has not tried to revive her campaign with a promise to reduce the inflow of economic migrants, despite her promising to upgrade border security many times. RELATED — CNN’s Zakaria: Biden Should Go Back to Trump’s Immigration Policies A growing number of GOP leaders — including Trump’s pick for Vice President, JD Vance — recognize that the federal migration policy imposes huge pocketbook and civic costs on ordinary Americans. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL), for example, wrote an October 17 article for CompactMag.com, showing that migration has damaged ordinary Americans: … immigration remained within sustainable limits through most of the 1970s and ’80s, and it remained within most Americans’ grasp to make ends meet. My own parents, themselves immigrants from Cuba, earned enough to buy a home and raise four children on the salaries of a hotel bartender and stay-at-home mom who occasionally worked as a maid. As recently as 1985, meanwhile, the average US-born man could afford a middle-class lifestyle for a family of four on about 40 weeks of wages (compared with about 62 weeks today). In other words, the American Dream was alive and well, for immigrants and natives alike. But Washington, DC, changed the rules for ordinary Americans by supercharging global trade and migration, Rubio wrote: The consequences of this for US-born men have been catastrophic. The percentage of prime-age men now working or looking for work is close to what it was in 1940, in the throes of the Great Depression. Meanwhile, one economist estimates that by 2016, immigrants had “increased the size of the low-skilled workforce by roughly 25 percent.” The Biden-Harris administration has only compounded the problem. By one government count, the administration has admitted at least 6.5 million more illegal migrants since then—and that doesn’t include an estimated 1.5 million “gotaways.” Some Wall Street investors are touting an alternative, low-migration strategy that would expand economic growth and prosperity. “I can argue, in the developed countries, the big winners are the countries that have shrinking populations,” BlackRock founder Larry Fink said at a pro-globalist event hosted by the World Economic Forum in Saudi Arabia. He continued: That’s something that most people never talked about. We always used to think [a] shrinking population is a cause for negative [economic] growth. But in my conversations with the leadership of these large, developed countries [such as China, and Japan] that have xenophobic anti-immigration policies, they don’t allow anybody to come in — [so they have] shrinking demographics — these countries will rapidly develop robotics and AI and technology … If a promise of all that transforms productivity, which most of us think it will [emphasis added] — we’ll be able to elevate the standard living in countries, the standard of living for individuals, even with shrinking populations. In contrast, countries with expanding populations need to focus on basic issues of education and the “rule of law,” said Fink, adding: So for those countries that have rising populations, the answer will be education … [and] for those countries that do not have a foundation of rule of law, or education, that’s where the [economic] divide is going to get more and more extreme. Breitbart News has closely c0vered the federal government’s post-1990 use of migration to boost the U.S. consumer economy by extracting cheap workers, government-aided consumers, and apartment-sharing renters from poor countries. Extraction Migration Since at least 1990, the federal government has quietly adopted a policy of Extraction Migration to grow the consumer economy after Congress voted to help investors move the high-wage manufacturing sector to lower-wage countries. The migration policy extracts vast amounts of human resources from needy countries. The additional workers, white-collar graduates, consumers, and renters push up stock values by shrinking Americans’ wages, subsidizing low-productivity companies, boosting rents, and spiking real estate prices. The little-recognized economic policy has loosened the economic and civic feedback signals that animate a stable economy and democracy. It has pushed many native-born Americans out of careers in a wide variety of business sectors, reduced Americans’ productivity and political clout, slowed high-tech innovation, shrunk trade, crippled civic solidarity, and incentivized government officials and progressives to ignore the rising death rate of discarded, low-status Americans. Donald Trump’s campaign team recognizes the economic impact of migration. Biden’s unpopular policy is “flooding America’s labor pool with millions of low-wage illegal migrants who are directly attacking the wages and opportunities of hard-working Americans,” said a May statement from Trump’s campaign. The secretive economic policy also sucks jobs and wealth from heartland states by subsidizing coastal investors and government agencies with a flood of low-wage workers, high-occupancy renters, and government-aided consumers. Similar policies have damaged citizens and economies in Canada and the United Kingdom. The colonialism-like policy has also damaged small nations and has killed hundreds of Americans and thousands of migrants, including many on the taxpayer-funded jungle trail through the Darien Gap in Panama.

Title: Data centers and Crypto: Adapting for the future

Transitioning to spine-leaf architecture ensures blockchain networks maintain reliability and security, surpassing traditional data center designs. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. The following is a guest post from Shane Neagle, Editor In Chief from The Tokenist. The steady Bitcoin trickle into the mainstream consciousness since 2009 mainnet launch had many cascading effects. First, it served as a revelatory vehicle by exemplifying the nature of money; why it should be outside of central banking, and why fixed supply is important for the valuation of money. Second, Bitcoin sparked an entire crypto industry, further making the case for decentralized financial services that eliminate gatekeepers in favor of smart contracts enforced by blockchain networks. As this $2.2 trillion sector develops, banks are further poised to lose their role as trusted intermediaries. Third, data center infrastructure is becoming more important than ever. Whether home-based or as large mining operations, crypto infrastructure needs reliable high-performance computing resources, storage capacity and memory alongside fast networking to maximally reduce blockchain latency. In fact, data centers are so critical that an entire knowledge field emerged to balance power requirements, cooling solutions, server density and crypto hosting location. When these factors come together, crypto needs to forge an indelible mark on the data center design itself. Let’s explore how. In the early days of the internet, broadband connection was rare. This necessitated local resources within businesses and institutions to be used for data storage and management. By the end of 2000s, broadband infrastructure had become sufficiently ubiquitous to start supporting cloud computing. In other words, data centers were being delocalized into remote, scalable, on-demand server clusters. The ability to eliminate on-premise infrastructure and host data and apps remotely drastically cut upfront capital expenditure. Of course, this ultimately benefited Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud as the data center triumvirate that powers the bulk of today’s digital landscape. However, securing blockchain networks exerts an entirely new load layer. Because these digital ledgers facilitate real-time transaction processing, between multiple nodes to verify them, extra CPU, GPU power and RAM is needed to minimize congestion and latency. And if there is a sudden spike in blockchain network traffic, this too requires resource redundancy. This is why both AI and blockchain-oriented data centers have been transitioning from traditional client-to-server architecture (north to south) to spine-and leaf architecture (east to west). The spine-leaf approach makes for a non-hierarchical design that allows data to flow horizontally between servers. This is critical for blockchain networks, as each node directly communicates with other nodes without having to go through a congestible central point. Therefore, a spine-leaf architecture alleviates bottleneck and single point failure potential. Because this mirrors the spirit of crypto decentralization and peer-to-peer (P2P) communication, spine-leaf data centers have become the new standard for blockchain reliability and security. As blockchain networks need greater compute power to validate transactions and execute smart contracts, so is there greater need for energy consumption. By 2022, blockchain networks have already carved a significant proportion of data center electricity demand. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), the data sector servicing the crypto industry globally consumed 460 TWh in 2022, which is forecasted to more than double by 2026. For comparison, France consumed 447 TWh annually in 2021. These trends clearly point to a reliable source of power, which is why Microsoft saw fit to make a 20-year deal with Constellation Energy to restart Unit 1 nuclear reactor in 2028. In Europe, the European Commission even designated Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) as “green” to balance decarbonisation efforts with increased electricity demand. But raw power capacity is only the beginning of scaling. To make crypto-oriented data centers more efficient, they are moving closer to power plants. This is best exemplified by Bitcoin. The primary cryptocurrency uses a proof-of-work algorithm to secure the network, effectively anchoring Bitcoin in the physical world of energy and hardware assets. This is what ultimately gives Bitcoin its value as decentralized money and global transfer of wealth. In essence, Bitcoin represents digital energy. But because power is lost over long distance electrical transmission, due to copper/aluminum resistance, it would be wasteful to erect crypto data centers just anywhere. Rather, they should be as close to power plants as possible to minimize transmission loss. Case in point, the New York state power plant bypasses state level network by directly plugging in thousands of servers. Likewise, Ward Roddam, mayor of Rockdale, Texas, recently made the case that Bitcoin mining can revitalize communities by investing to siphon excess energy and stabilize the electric grid with flexible load demand. “Riot Platforms is building a state-of-the-art facility in Corsicana, which will be one of Navarro County’s largest employers. The mine could bring $1.4 billion in taxable purchases and over $115 million in wages over the next decade.“ Another crypto mining company, TeraWulf, has been building its Nautilus Cryptomine adjacent to the Susquehanna nuclear power plant, now in the hands of Talen Energy. This will be the first zero-carbon, nuclear-powered Bitcoin mining facility. With a 200 MW capacity, this would be the equivalent to ~160,000 US households’ energy consumption annually. In addition to spatial proximity to reduce transmission loss, data centers servicing blockchain networks need particular mechanical, electrical and plumbing (MEP) requirements. As every PC owner knows, the source of such requirements at large scale comes from heat management. Continuous solving of cryptography puzzles requires great computing power which generates heat. For many years, air cooling has been the go-to solution to prolong hardware longevity and dissipate heat. Unfortunately, cooling also draws significant energy on top of computing itself. This is why there is a new trend to rely more on direct-to-chip liquid cooling (immersion cooling) which cuts down on power usage. ₿𝗥𝗘𝗔𝗞𝗜𝗡𝗚: 33,000 new immersion-cooled #bitcoin mining computers connect online today. This 100 megawatt facility is now the largest electricity user in Sadersville, Georgia. pic.twitter.com/5TzqF9f3IT — Documenting ₿itcoin 📄 (@DocumentingBTC) February 13, 2024 But even so, these types of data centers need advanced HVAC control systems and capacity to handle thermal loads. Equally so, high-power-density clusters, at 20 – 40 kW per rack, require larger power transformers, backup systems and high-capacity power distribution units (PDUs). For example, Crypto Minotaur PDU can handle up to 92.4kW worth of power density. Lastly, to ensure continuous blockchain workloads, such data centers typically rely on backup redundancy via natural gas or diesel power generators coupled with automatic transfer switches (ATS). Those familiar with the inner workings of Bitcoin code know that its security is derived from the concept of Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT). In short, even if multiple network nodes fail, the consensus on the current state of the ledger is still achieved. In data center design, this means that blockchain miners have to account for redundancy tiers according to the Uptime Institute: Of course, as each tier increases redundancy, so does it increases the cost. Large companies with deep pockets can afford such scaling and then attract smaller businesses into their cloud computing ecosystems. Case in point, Microsoft Azure’s data center infrastructure is certified as ISO/IEC 27001:2013 and NIST SP 800-53 for network security and reliability, which is the prerequisite to achieve Tier IV level of fault tolerance. However, such redundancy is not strictly necessary for Bitcoin needs, as other nodes around the globe can take up the slack. Bitcoin’s 10-minute block confirmation interval was intentionally picked by Satoshi Nakamoto to inject inherent redundancy in the network. Nonetheless, this may not apply to blockchain networks like Solana (SOL) or Avalanche (AVAX) with near-instant settlements that aim to supplant Visa-like money transfer systems. For activities like day trading, they would require maximum uptime provided by Tier IV data centers. To that end, Solana Foundation formed the Solana Server Program. Its flexible month-to-month contracts rely on data center providers like Edgevana. Ethereum and Avalanche typically use AWS, Google Cloud and Tencent Cloud for the bulk of their server needs. After the 4th Bitcoin halving in April, miners’ rewards were cut in half, from 6.25 to 3.125 BTC. At the same time, Bitcoin network difficulty increased from 86.3886 T to present 88.4044 T. It is further estimated that the next Bitcoin difficulty adjustment will increase by 3.81% on October 9th. This translates to fewer payments for the same amount of computational exertion and energy consumption. Yet, this would exert a negative impact, to the point of bankruptcy, only if Bitcoin price were to fall under $40k, according to CoinShares’ report. Taking into account the spectrum of initial capital expenditures, this translates to different cost runways for different mining companies. Analyze the return on investment for crypto mining operations, particularly in light of recent reductions in Bitcoin mining rewards. Consider the potential for additional revenue streams, such as converting facilities for heat reuse. But with major selling pressures out of the way, in particular from the German government and Mt. Gox payments, it is more likely that BTC price will go up rather than drop. Historically, BTC price achieves a new all-time high within ~18 months following the halving event. Moreso, the USG’s uncontrollable spending is likely to further cement Bitcoin’s case for sound money as the dollar’s value continues to gradually erode. Lastly, Bitcoin mining efficiency continues to improve, as noted by aforementioned cooling immersion and upgrades to newer ASIC machines such as Antminer S21. For an electric grid to remain stable (and usable) it has to balance periods of high and low demand. The Bitcoin network is ideally suited for this task as Bitcoin miners can adjust usage on the fly. After Texas legislatures passed House Bill 591, Bitcoin data centers have a further role to play in energy sustainability. The bill allows oil and gas operators to sell vented/flared gas to on-site mobile data centers. This gas would otherwise be wasted as a byproduct of extraction. Such redirection is estimated to reduce their carbon footprint by up to 63%. On top of this, Bitcoin data centers using immersion cooling can use that energy to heat water. Using this approach Canadian crypto miner startup MintGreen has been deploying Digital Boilers in Vancouver. 500 kVA for in-house Digital Boiler testing ♨️🌱 pic.twitter.com/KMhlgbFbej — MintGreen (@MintGreenHQ) March 19, 2024 Excess data center heat could also be used to heat greenhouses, as showcased in the Netherlands by BloemBitcoin. 🌷 💨 pic.twitter.com/uEemmptSGg — BitcoinBloem (@BloemBitcoin) March 4, 2023 If Bitcoin price gains new high ground in 2025 and beyond, it is not difficult to see greater mainstream acceptance of such innovative solutions. Crypto mining first brought into focus large scale high-performance computing (HPC). For the longest time, this was met with hostility, often painted as wasteful. After BlackRock’s successful integration of Bitcoin via its IBIT ETF, such concerns have largely disappeared. Yes, this was the same BlackRock that pushed the Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) framework in the finance sector. Crypto mining is now set to be overshadowed by generative AI infrastructure, benefiting from years of lessons learned in large scale data center deployment.

Leinster are expected to give an update on the injury which forced Ciarán Frawley in the 17th minute of their 33-12 win over Connacht in the Sportsground in their weekly Monday bulletin. The Ireland international limped off gingerly after being tackled by David Hawkshaw in the build-up to Leinster’s second try by Liam Turner when his foot was momentarily trapped under the Connacht centre. “I don’t know, is it his foot or ankle. I’m not 100 per cent sure yet,” admitted Leo Cullen. “The two new caps were taking centre stage in the dressingroom, so we’ll find out and will know more on Monday,” added the Leinster head coach in reference to their two debutants, 20-year-old hooker Stephen Smyth and 21-year-old centre Hugh Cooney. Frawley was replaced by Ross Byrne, who steered Leinster to their fifth bonus point in five games to lead the BKT URC table by seven points, 10 points clear of Ulster, a dozen ahead of Connacht and 14 clear of Munster after their error-strewn 34-19 loss to the Stormers in Cape Town. Frawley was unlikely to feature next Saturday at the Aviva Stadium against the Lions, who sit in second place with the only other unbeaten record and a game in hand on Leinster, when Sam Prendergast is likely to return. But after his match-winning drop goals in Ireland’s last outing against the Springboks in Durban, Frawley’s anticipated presence in the Irish matchday squad against New Zealand in their opening Autumn Nations Series game at the Aviva Stadium on Friday, November 8th must be in doubt. “We’re delighted with the win,” said Cullen on a blustery night in Galway, after Leinster stormed into a 21-5 lead by half-time with three first-half tries and completed another bonus point within six minutes of the restart. “It’s bloody tough coming here. Conditions were tricky as well out there. I thought we started the game well again, that’s a few weeks in a row we’ve started the game well. “We got in for two good tries and probably had another couple of opportunities we didn’t take. Connacht came back into the game and had to play into the wind, it was very difficult to kick into the wind. “They got in for a good try and you’re thinking, ‘this is probably not going to be a big enough lead’. We did well to score on half-time, which gives us a bit of scoreboard separation. “We started the second half well and got in, but Connacht were challenging us the whole time. Then they eventually got in for a good try, and it was going to be a tight 15 minutes, and then Ross kicks off and then Andrew Osborne gobbles the ball out of the air and scores an incredible try, which probably just took the sting out of Connacht a little bit. “Overall, we’re delighted, with five academy players in the 23, two guys making their debuts. There’s lots of positives in that.” It’s already becoming hard to credit that Gus McCarthy is still one of the those five academy players. The 21-year-old hooker, who captained Blackrock College to the Leinster Schools Senior Cup and the Ireland Under-20s to a Six Nations title and World Cup final two seasons ago, was making his third start of the season for Leinster in addition to Emerging Ireland’s win over Western Force, after which he was called home to play the second half of last week’s win over Munster in Croke Park. This was in light of Rónan Kelleher joining long-term casualty Dan Sheahan on the casualty list after an ankle procedure which will sideline him for the New Zealand game and beyond. With the Ulster pair of Rob Herring and Tom Stewart yet to feature this season, the in-form Dave Heffernan looks favourite to start against the All Blacks but although it’s probably too early for McCarthy, who caught the eye at the Dexcom Stadium with three clean breaks, he is nonetheless putting himself in the conversation. “Yeah, he’s been fantastic, Gus,” said Cullen. “He had lots of big moments in the game today. I talked about him last week, we were talking about the hookers, the three guys we had during pre-season. “Stephen [Smyth] was away with the 20s, so it’s good to see him come off the bench today and make his debut which is fantastic. He’s definitely one for the future as well. “With Gus, he was fighting it out with John [McKee] and Lee [Barron] over the course of pre-season and he did well. He got a start in that first game against Edinburgh, had a quick trip to South Africa and played two games while we played one, and straight into Croke Park last week. “It’s been a fantastic first five rounds, which has included a trip to South Africa, a brilliant experience for him.” Gerry Thornley is Rugby Correspondent of The Irish Times Sign up to the Irish Times weekly rugby digest for the view from the press box with Gerry Thornley © 2024 The Irish Times DAC
