Title: DoubleVerify Won 70% Of The Former Moat Advertisers It Courted

Moat, ya basic. Well, ya were basic, at least according to DoubleVerify CEO Mark Zagorski. “One thing we did note is that Moat had a pretty basic product,” Zagorski said on Wednesday during the company’s Q3 earnings call in response to an investor asking for more detail on the Oracle opportunity. In September, Oracle shut down all of its advertising products and services, including brand safety and verification provider Moat, leaving Moat’s former advertiser clients ripe for the pitching. Both DV and Integral Ad Science have been in pitchapalooza mode since June, when Oracle first announced, rather abruptly, that it would exit the advertising business. According to Zagorski, DoubleVerify has won 70% of the Moat advertiser RFPs it’s participated in, including P&G, BlackRock, Dish Network, Charter, Dunkin’ parent company Inspire Brands, Kellogg’s and Google. Slow burn But this was “no normal RFP process,” Zagorski said. An RFP usually takes between three and six months, sometimes even longer if a client wants to run tests and do a deep dive into the technology. But here, with so little time between Oracle’s original announcement and when it planned to actually pull the plug, the process was condensed into roughly six weeks. “In many cases, it was very aggressive technical due diligence plus, you know, getting your best price out there,” Zagorski said.

These client wins are flashy and have promise, in other words, but they won’t benefit the bottom line in a big way right away, said CFO Nicola Allais. “The full revenue impact of these opportunities will materialize over a long period,” Allais said, “typically between one to three years of onboarding through our ability to upsell our social and activation solutions.” The upsell (eventually) Attention measurement, social media measurement and social activation are all top priorities for DV to expand beyond verification and brand safety to also include performance solutions. Scibids, the AI startup DV acquired for $125 million last summer, is key to that plan. Today, 15 of DoubleVerify’s top 100 customers use Scibids to optimize programmatic bids across platforms, and DV has been able to upsell Scibids to nearly 50 total customers, Zagorski said. He added that Scibids is on pace to generate $100 million in revenue by 2028. Scibids is DV’s “core investment” on the performance side, he said, and “we’re going to start leaning into and pushing it into other parts of our business.” Presumably, DV will also eventually upsell Scibids to its newly wooed former Moat clients. But DV’s nearer-term goal is to become more than just a like-for-like replacement for Moat. “Moat didn’t do social; Moat didn’t have a very robust, dynamic pre-bid suitability product,” Zagorski said. “These are sophisticated advertisers – they’re big spenders – and I think there’s a big opportunity for us down the road.”

Title: JPMorgan Rebrands Blockchain Division from ‘Onyx’ to ‘Kinexys’ and Unveils New Features

Photo Credit: Facebook/ JP Morgan With Kinexys, we’re building on the momentum of Onyx, the bank said JPMorgan is expanding its alliance with blockchain technology. In a recent development, the US-based bank said it has rebranded its blockchain unit, originally launched as ‘Onyx', to ‘Kinexys' to signify its operational roadmap for Web3 adoption. The rebranding brings along an array of new financial products and services with blockchain at the centre. This development follows JPMorgan's intensified exploration into Real World Asset (RWA) tokenisation. Expanding on the rebranding, the bank explained that the name ‘Kinexys' is derived from the word ‘kinetic,' meaning ‘caused by motion.' “This is representative of the way we move money, assets and financial information around the world with speed, ease and efficiency. Together with our clients, we aim to move beyond the limitations of legacy technology and realise the promise of a multichain world,” Umar Farooq, co-head of JPMorgan Payments said in a statement. As of November 2024, JPMorgan's market cap is reportedly ₹58.517 trillion (roughly $ 693.5 billion), making it the world's 13th most valuable company by market cap. In its statement, the bank asserted that integrating blockchain into its systems has established a secure infrastructure for clients to transfer cross-border funds seamlessly, even outside of traditional market hours, while also enabling new services related to RWA tokenisation. “Soon, we'll be adding foreign exchange (FX) capabilities to Kinexys Digital Payments (formerly JPM Coin System). We've also announced a proof-of-concept (POC) from Kinexys Digital Assets and Kinexys Labs. This POC demonstrates on-chain privacy, identity and composability—major themes that will play significantly into our continued evolution,” the statement announced. Over the past two years, JPMorgan's Onyx initiative has attracted prominent institutional clients, including Siemens, Ant International, and BlackRock. As per company figures, Onyx managed to exceed $1.5 trillion (roughly Rs. 1,26,55,856 crore) in notional value, processing an average daily transaction volume of over $2 billion. “We're furthering our exploration of privacy, identity and composability in blockchain ecosystems. nhanced privacy measures are crucial for improving access to digital assets, while streamlining identity management is intrinsically linked to the potential for tokenised assets at scale,” JPMorgan noted. Beyond blockchain, the New York City-based bank is also exploring other Web3 technologies. Despite a slowdown in the metaverse sector, the bank announced last December that it was looking forward to test the ‘immersive training applications' of metaverse. In May 2022, the bank predicted that as regulatory oversight of crypto assets grows, they will eventually integrate with traditional finance. That same year, the bank also explored launching a crypto wallet service to address emerging market demands.

LAST UPDATE | 22 hrs ago KATHLEEN WATKINS, writer, broadcaster and musician, has died at the age of 90. Kathleen, who was married to Gay Byrne, turned 90 on 17 October. Gay Byrne, who hosted the Late Late Show from 1962 until 1999, died five years ago – on 4 November 2019. Kathleen enjoyed acclaim as a harpist and folk singer before joining RTÉ as a continuity announcer on television. She was the first announcer to appear on screen on the opening night of Telefís Éireann on New Year’s Eve 1961. In later years, she enjoyed success with her series of children’s books. She and Gay Byrne married in 1964 and had two daughters, Crona and Suzy. A statement issued today by their daughters confirmed the news. “It is with great sadness we have to announce the death of Kathleen Watkins,” the statement noted. “Kathleen died peacefully earlier today surrounded by her loving family in the wonderful care of the Team at the Blackrock Clinic. “Kathleen’s family are devastated by the loss of their much loved mother and devoted Nanakit to her grandchildren Cian, Sadhbh, Kate, Saoirse and Harry.” Funeral arrangements will be announced later, the statement added. Advertisement Taoiseach Simon Harris was among the first to pay tribute, describing Kathleen as “a magnetic person with a warm and witty personality and presence, as well as her considerable artistic talent”. “She and her husband, Gay Byrne, were one of Ireland’s most famous couples and it was always obvious to see their devotion to each other and their family throughout their long and loving marriage,” Harris said in a statement. “Whilst Gay Byrne is perhaps the most famous face RTÉ has ever produced, Kathleen will always be one of the first faces to appear on screen on RTÉ’s opening night. “To her daughters, Crona and Suzy, her grandchildren and wider circle of family, friends and colleagues, I am sorry for your loss. May she rest in peace.” President Michael D Higgins also paid tribute, saying he and his wife Sabina learned of Kathleen’s passing “with great sorrow”. “We were among the many who had the greatest regard and affection for her. I know that this was shared in particular by all of Kathleen’s colleagues in RTÉ. “Sabina and I convey our sympathy to them, along with so many in Ireland’s cultural life to which Kathleen made such a memorable contribution. “These talents were demonstrated through her work as an artist and broadcaster, as well as a writer who was appreciated by people of all ages.” “We recall also the warmth of Kathleen’s personality, her humour and kindness – she represented the best of her generation in so many ways and during such a formative period in our country. “I hope that all who loved Kathleen will be comforted by these memories, her truly remarkable legacy and her inspiring life.” President Higgins offered his condolences to Kathleen’s daughters, grandchildren and wider family.

Kathleen Watkins President Michael D Higgins had led tributes to broadcaster and wife of Gay Byrne, Kathleen Watkins, who has died at the age of 90. Tributes have poured in for Ms Watkins this afternoon from across the world of politics, media and beyond. “It was with great sorrow that Sabina and I learned of the passing of Kathleen Watkins, we were among the many who had the greatest regard and affection for her,” said President Higgins in a statement. "I know that this was shared in particular by all of Kathleen’s colleagues in RTÉ. Sabina and I convey our sympathy to them, along with so many in Ireland’s cultural life to which Kathleen made such a memorable contribution. “These talents were demonstrated through her work as an artist and broadcaster, as well as a writer who was appreciated by people of all ages. “Kathleen was the beloved life partner of Gay Byrne who we remember now, recalling the joy of their unique partnership. We recall also the warmth of Kathleen’s personality, her humour and kindness – she represented the best of her generation in so many ways and during such a formative period in our country. “I hope that all who loved Kathleen will be comforted by these memories, her truly remarkable legacy and her inspiring life. “As President of Ireland, may I offer our deepest condolences to the family of Kathleen Watkins, her daughters Suzy and Crona, her grandchildren and wider family.” Meanwhile, the daughter of Kathleen Watkins and Gay Byrne paid tribute to her “unbelievable” mother who passed away aged 90. Her daughter Suzy Byrne told Joe Duffy on RTÉ Radio that their family is “devastated, but at the same time realise how lucky we were to have her. She was just unbelievable”. “Her adoration for her grandchildren was renowned. When I announced to her that I was pregnant with Cian, she said at that time I will forever be known as Nana Kit now and from that day on she wouldn't answer to anything else,” said Suzy. “The children that they are, and the children that they have become, is so much down to her. She taught them their manners, she introduced them to music, she insisted that when we came back from London that they really should do speech and drama. “Her relationship with Cian, Siabh, Saoirse, Kate and Harry was phenomenal and they have benefited from her interest in them and her education of them”, she added. Ms Watkins was described by long term friend Maire-Louise O’Donnell as “possibly one of the most cultured people". Ms O’Donnell said she was always interested in culture, from theatre and film to poetry and language and in young people who were writing, singing and in the media. “She was very much a renaissance woman,” Ms O’Donnell said. Ms Watkins fell on the way to mass last year and had been attending Blackrock Clinic since. She passed away five years after her husband, whose fifth anniversary was this week. The couple married 60 years ago, in 1964, having met in 1957. They had two daughters, Crona and Suzy. Ms Watkins was born in Saggart, Dublin, and was an acclaimed harpist and folk singer before joining RTÉ. She was the first continuity announcer to appear on screen on the opening night of Ireland’s new television station, Telefís Éireann, on New Year's Eve 1961. The couple raised their family in Howth, north Dublin, and moved southside to Sandymount in their retirement. In later years, Ms Watkins wrote a series of children’s books about a piglet character called Pigín, which won an Irish Book Award. In her final interview, with Sunday Independent journalist Barry Egan last September, Ms Watkins spoke openly about her life in the wake of her husband’s death and revealed that he had made plans for her funeral. She said she had picked the music and the prayers already. Speaking about the music, she said: “I have an idea but I won’t say. I would like Frank McNamara to be in charge of that. He was the musical director of The Late Late. He will know exactly what to do. I will leave instructions.” Taoiseach Simon Harris paid tribute to Ms Watkins in a statement this afternoon. "It is with great sadness that I have learned of the death of broadcaster and author Kathleen Watkins,” Mr Harris said. “Kathleen was a magnetic person with a warm and witty personality and presence, as well as her considerable artistic talent. “She and her husband, Gay Byrne, were one of Ireland’s most famous couples and it was always obvious to see their devotion to each other and their family throughout their long and loving marriage. “Whilst Gay Byrne is perhaps the most famous face RTÉ has ever produced, Kathleen will always be one of the first faces to appear on screen on RTÉ’s opening night. “She was multi-talented in her own right, and indeed like many households around the country, her books and Pigín have a special place on the bookcase in my home. “To her daughters, Crona and Suzy, her grandchildren and wider circle of family, friends and colleagues, I am sorry for your loss. “May she rest in peace.” Ceann Comhairle Seán Ó Fearghaíl led tributes in the Dáil to Ms Watkins in the Dáil, describing her as a “national treasure.” She was “an inspiration to many to people of his generation”, he said. "We send our deepest sympathies on behalf of the House to her daughters and extended family.” Tánaiste Micheál Martin described Ms Watkins as a “famous musician, harpist, writer, and broadcaster.” He noted she was the first continuity announcer on RTÉ on the opening night of Teilifís Éireann, on New Year's Eve 1961 — 63 years ago. “I think she was an iconic figure in Irish broadcasting, and indeed, in terms of the history of modern broadcasting," Mr Martin said. “She was a dignified woman who made an outstanding contribution in her own right to the worlds of music, broadcasting, and latterly writing children's books ."

Title: Coinbase stock soars amid crypto upswing: What’s driving the rally?

With major players eyeing Bitcoin ETFs, analysts predict even greater demand for platforms like Coinbase. In a remarkable turnaround, Coinbase [COIN] stock has experienced a significant surge, coinciding with the latest upswing in the cryptocurrency market. Analysts attribute this growth to several positive factors within the digital assets space. Coinbase stock is up by over 15% as Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies rally. Bitcoin recently reached new highs, while Ether and other leading assets have similarly appreciated. “This price movement brings renewed optimism and signals resilience in the market,” said Jaret Seiberg, financial analyst at Cowen. With Bitcoin hovering around $70,000, some analysts see this as a pivotal turning point. The broader trend highlights an increasing interest from institutional investors, who play a crucial role in stabilizing the crypto market. COIN’s stock has benefited directly from this, as many investors see it as a gateway to crypto exposure. Institutions like BlackRock and Fidelity have recently shown interest in launching Bitcoin ETFs, which could make crypto assets more accessible to the public. This growing support has elevated investor confidence in Coinbase as a leading exchange. According to Dan Dolev, a senior analyst at Mizuho, “Coinbase’s value goes beyond trading; it has become a household name for accessing crypto investments.” The potential approval of Bitcoin ETFs could provide a significant advantage for Coinbase, positioning it as a key player in the ecosystem. “If a Bitcoin ETF is approved, it will likely drive a substantial volume to platforms like Coinbase,” said Owen Lau, an analyst with Oppenheimer. Lau added that the resulting liquidity could lead to increased revenue for Coinbase. The rally in Coinbase stock has sent a positive signal across the broader cryptocurrency and fintech industries. The growth of regulated, accessible platforms like Coinbase is viewed as vital for mainstream adoption. Analysts argue that Coinbase’s success may prompt similar companies to explore public offerings, increasing transparency and trust in the industry. Additionally, Coinbase’s recent rally could also encourage more people to participate in crypto markets, leading to an increased demand for digital assets. This aligns with the long-term vision of the company, which aims to make crypto universally accessible. “More people in the market increases liquidity, and that’s positive for everyone involved,” noted Seiberg. Coinbase’s stock price gains underscore the market’s anticipation of future growth within the crypto sector. As Coinbase remains a trusted entry point for many, its success reflects the rising demand for crypto investments. Read Ethereum’s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024–2025 With ETFs and institutional backing likely to grow, the platform may see continued benefits from crypto’s bullish wave. The Coinbase surge highlights how traditional finance and crypto increasingly intersect, creating new avenues for both industries to thrive.

Title: Bitcoin Registers Fourth-Best Day of 2024 as BlackRock ETF Posts Record Volume
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2024/11/07/bitcoin-registers-fourth-best-day-of-2024-as-blackrock-etf-posts-record-volume/

Election 2024 coverage presented by Bitcoin (BTC) posted its fourth-best day of the year on Wednesday following the U.S. presidential election victory of Donald Trump, who voiced support for the crypto industry during his campaign. The largest cryptocurrency by market value climbed more than 9% to hit a record $76,481, CoinDesk Indices data show. It hit 9.7% at the end of February, during a rally that took it to the previous high in March, gained 10% after dropping from that high and added 12% after the Aug. 5 yen carry trade unwind. While Wednesday's swing may concern investors who think the gain is unsustainable, earlier research indicated BTC could rise 11% on a Trump victory. The rally coincided with massive inflows into spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which added a net $621.9 million, according to Farside data. The flow, one of the highest figures since the products' introduction in January, snapped a three-day streak of outflows. Total net inflows have now reached $24.2 billion. Among notable performances, Grayscale's Bitcoin Mini Trust (BTC) registered $108.8 million, its second-biggest day since the start of trading. Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB) saw a $100.9 million inflow, also one of its biggest net inflow days. BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), in contrast, posted a second-straight day of net outflows, losing a total of $113.3 million over the period. Trading volume in the ETF was at a record level, according to Senior Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. "IBIT just had its biggest volume day ever with $4.1b traded," Balchunas wrote. "That's more volume than stocks like Berkshire, Netflix, or Visa saw today. It was also up 10%, its second-best day since launching, some of this will convert into inflows". Overall, "the group of bitcoin ETFs did $6b, their best day since the crazy early days. Most of the ETFs did 2x their average. It was just an all-around banger day for an infant category that never ceases to amaze," he wrote. To provide some historical context, ETF trade volume reached a $9.9 billion peak during the March bull run, according to data from checkonchain. Total trade volume on Nov. 6 reached approximately $76 billion, comprising futures volume of $62 billion, spot volume of $8 billion and ETF trade volume of $6 billion, so ETF trade volume is still a small percentage of the total. Ether (ETH) is lagging behind bitcoin's 2024 performance. Net inflows into ether U.S. spot ETFs totaled $52.3 million, the most since Sept. 27, according to Farside data. As of press time, bitcoin is trading at just over $75,000, up 77% year-to-date, while ether is trading at $2,822, up 20% year-to-date. Edited by Sheldon Reback.

Skip to comments. Posted on 11/07/2024 2:48:24 AM PST by RoosterRedux Democracy prevailed; the people will have their way in spite of all that was done and said to prevent that from happening. Trump won despite nearly every institution in America – media, academia, and big business, too – not just opposing him but opposing him virulently, comparing him to Hitler and warning that his election would spell the end of democracy itself. ... Trump’s win is more than an epic personal and policy success story, it’s a vote of “no-confidence” in institutions and governance by authoritative experts. Institutions fail when they do not focus on their core mission. Consider all the institutions in America and Europe that have lost their way, focusing on the politically fashionable and fringe issues. ... [N]early all government institutions now focus on fringe issues or progressive fads instead of on their core missions. Prosecutors promote “equity” instead of locking up criminals. Homeland Security does not focus on securing the border, but rather on smoothly facilitating illegal immigration. ... And it’s not just government institutions that have lost their way. The core mission of the media is supposed to be delivering news, not crafting partisan and half-true narratives with the intention of swaying elections. ... The core mission of universities and colleges is to open minds and expand knowledge. Does anyone think free inquiry into unfashionable ideas is even tolerated...? Nor are once venerable business institutions focusing on their core missions. While Disney, Budweiser, Target, and BlackRock are notorious examples of businesses that strayed into lecturing consumers instead of serving them, nearly every big business today invests time and resources into DEI and ESG initiatives that advance the agenda of the far-left wing of the Democratic Party. Putting political commissars into C-Suites distracts from the businesses’ core mission, creates divisions within the workforce, and alienates consumers.

Fidelity's FBTC captures $308.8 million as BlackRock's IBIT sees $69.1 million outflow. Major asset management firms reported significant inflows in their Bitcoin ETFs following Donald Trump’s victory in the 2024 US presidential election. On Nov. 6, Fidelity’s FBTC saw an inflow of $308.8 million, while BlackRock’s IBIT experienced an outflow of $69.1 million. Grayscale’s GBTC and BTC recorded an inflow of $30.9 million and $108 million, respectively, reversing previous outflows. Bitcoin’s price surged to a new all-time high of $76,400, breaking its previous record twice since the election. This price increase coincided with the substantial ETF inflows, suggesting renewed institutional interest. Ark’s ARKB reported an inflow of $127 million, and Bitwise’s BITB gained $100.9 million on the same day. The shifts in ETF holdings reflect a complex market response. Companies like Valkyrie and VanEck also reported changes in their Bitcoin ETF positions. Valkyrie’s BRRR had a slight outflow of $2.6 million, while VanEck’s HODL saw an inflow of $17.2 million.

Title: BlackRock records largest single-day outflow, but Bitcoin ETFs still post $622 million gains
URL: https://cryptobriefing.com/bitcoin-etfs-inflows-despite-blackrock-outflow/
Time Published: 2024-11-07T05:37:32Z

Share this article US spot Bitcoin ETFs attracted approximately $622 million in net inflows on November 6, ending a three-day losing streak, despite BlackRock’s IBIT experiencing its largest single-day outflow since launch. According to data from Farside Investors, the world’s largest Bitcoin ETF recorded around $69 million in net outflows yesterday, while Valkyrie’s BRRR saw over $2 million in outflows. IBIT’s loss came as a surprise given that the fund started strong with over $1 billion in shares traded within the first 20 minutes of market opening. According to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, IBIT achieved its highest trading-volume day, reaching $4.1 billion. “For context, that’s more volume than stocks like Berkshire, Netflix, or Visa saw today,” the analyst said. “It was also up 10%, its second best day since launching. Some of this will convert into inflows likely hitting Tue, Wed night.” However, he previously noted that considerable buying and selling activity did not translate into new investments or capital inflows into the ETF, meaning that high volume can result from both purchases and sales. Most ETFs traded at double their average volume, marking one of their best trading days since January’s initial launch period, Balchunas stated in a follow-up post. On Wednesday, Fidelity’s FBTC led the pack with nearly $309 million in net buying, followed by ARK Invest’s ARKB, which took in roughly $127 million. Major gains were also seen in Grayscale’s BTC and Bitwise’s BITB. The low-cost version of GBTC recorded nearly $109 million in new capital, its second-largest daily inflow since launch. Meanwhile, the BITB fund logged around $101 million, its best single-day performance since mid-February. Grayscale’s GBTC reported approximately $31 million in net inflows yesterday, while VanEck’s HODL saw around $17 million. Share this article Sign in to your account Don’t have an account?

Title: BlackRock Bitcoin ETF Experiences Sixth Day of Outflows Amid US Elections

We maintain editorial independence and consider content quality and factual accuracy to be non-negotiable. BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF has now seen six days of net outflows since its launch in January. This means more money has been withdrawn than those added on those days. On November 5, US election day, institutional investors seemed to play it safe, with the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) recording $44.2 million in net outflows, according to CoinGlass data. This outflow marked IBIT’s sixth negative flow since its launch in January. The last outflow was on October 10, when $10.8 million exited the fund. Altogether, US spot Bitcoin ETFs saw 116.8 million in net outflows. The largest outflow was from the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund, which saw $68.2 million taken out. The only fund with new inflow for the day was the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF, which had $19.3 million added to it. This marked the third consecutive day of net outflows for the US spot Bitcoin ETFs. The previous day, November 4, the 11 Bitcoin funds had their second-biggest outflow ever, with over $541.1 million withdrawn. After the US trading day ended, the spot crypto markets saw a big surge. This happened as election results started coming in, with Bitcoin price reaching a new all-time high of $75,000. Henrik Anderson, the chief investment officer at Apollo Crypto, explained that Bitcoin has become a key focus for traders worldwide. He called it the “election trade,” meaning that many investors are now looking to Bitcoin during the election period, hoping for gains. He looked at betting markets and traditional sources to estimate the chances of Donald Trump winning. Based on this information, Henrik figured there was an 80% to 90% chance that Trump would win. Henrik also said that Bitcoin seems to be following this trend. Bitcoin is already above $74,000, and he believes it may have already made most of its price move for now. If Trump wins, he predicts that Bitcoin could reach $100,000 by the end of the year. This is based on the idea that Trump’s victory would continue to boost Bitcoin’s price. In a blog post, Nate Geraci, the president of ETF Store, shared his thoughts on how elections affect investments. He said that people often exaggerate how much elections impact the market. He pointed out that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) leadership plays a much more significant role. The SEC is responsible for making investment rules and regulations, which often impact market sentiment. Geraci believes that the regulatory environment, especially those who lead the SEC, can significantly affect ETFs’ development and innovation. The SEC’s decision can either help or slow down new ideas in the ETF market. He also mentioned that no one knows what will happen with the situation. There are many unknowns, and it’s hard to predict the exact outcome. However, Geraci believes the best long-term solution would be to create a clear and balanced set of rules for crypto. This would require cooperation between the two major political parties to develop a framework that works for everyone. Still, he thinks it’s very likely that the results of this election will impact how quickly new crypto ETFs are developed.

Title: After Trump Win, Bernie Sanders Blames Democrats for Abandoning Working People
URL: https://inthesetimes.com/article/bernie-sanders-shawn-fain-democrats-trump
Time Published: 2024-11-07T03:55:00Z
Full Content:
Shortly before Vice President Kamala Harris delivered her concession speech on Wednesday, U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders forcefully called out Democratic Party leadership for losing The White House and at least one chamber of Congress to Republicans. “It should come as no great surprise that a Democratic Party which has abandoned working-class people would find that the working class has abandoned them,” Sanders (I-Vt.) said in a statement. ​“First, it was the white working class, and now it is Latino and Black workers as well.” “While the Democratic leadership defends the status quo, the American people are angry and want change,” said the senator, who decisively won reelection on Tuesday as Republicans reclaimed the upper chamber. ​“And they’re right.” After seeking the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016 and 2020, Sanders spent this cycle campaigning for Harris, warning of Republican President-elect Donald Trump’s return, blasting billionaire involvement in U.S. politics, and urging Democrats to better serve working people. In Sanders’ new statement, he highlighted U.S. income and wealth inequality, worker concerns about artificial intelligence, and the federal government’s failure to provide paid leave and universal healthcare while pouring billions of dollars into Israel’s war on the Gaza Strip. “Will the big money interests and well-paid consultants who control the Democratic Party learn any real lessons from this disastrous campaign? Will they understand the pain and political alienation that tens of millions of Americans are experiencing? Do they have any ideas as to how we can take on the increasingly powerful oligarchy which has so much economic and political power?” he asked. ​“Probably not.”​“In the coming weeks and months those of us concerned about grassroots democracy and economic justice need to have some very serious political discussions,” Sanders concluded. ​“Stay tuned.” Progressives — who have responded to Trump’s Electoral College and popular vote win by criticizing billionaires who backed him and promising ​“unprecedented resistance” during his second term — echoed Sanders’ remarks. Sharing Sanders’ statement on X — the social media platform owned by billionaire Trump backer Elon Musk — United Auto Workers (UAW) communications director Jonah Furman said: ​“The task has been clear for a decade. The question is only whether and when we will rise to the task.” Separately, the union’s president, Shawn Fain, said in a Wednesday statement that ​“UAW members around the country clocked in today under the same threat they faced yesterday: unchecked corporate greed destroying our lives, our families, and our communities.” “We’ve said all along that no matter who is in the White House, our fight remains the same,” Fain continued, pointing to the battle against ​“broken trade laws” like the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement and fights for good union jobs, a secure retirement for everyone, a living wage, affordable healthcare, and time for families. “It’s time for Washington, D.C. to put up or shut up, no matter the party, no matter the candidate,” added Fain, whose union endorsed Harris. ​“Will our government stand with the working class, or keep doing the bidding of the billionaires? That’s the question we face today. And that’s the question we’ll face tomorrow. The answer lies with us. No matter who’s in office.” In a post-election column, Chuck Idelson, former communications senior strategist for National Nurses United, made the case that ​“amid the postmortems and reckoning that will now follow the wreckage of Donald Trump’s return to ​‘absolute’ power, as authorized by the Supreme Court, there are … two notes in particular that deserve a deeper dive.” “In Missouri, a state Trump won by 58%, voters also acted to increase the state’s minimum wage to $15 an hour and to require employers to provide paid sick leave to workers,” he pointed out. ​“In Nebraska, another red state won by Trump, voters also passed a paid sick leave measure, Initiative 436, by 75%.” In addition to the ballot measures, Idelson highlighted that ​“in the multitude of exit poll results, one particularly stands out — 94% of registered Republicans voted for Trump, the exact same percentage he received in 2020. The heavy campaign focus on pulling away Republican voters from Trump turned out to be a pipe dream. The old cliché ​‘it’s the economy stupid,’ triumphed again.” Harris’ campaign, he argued, ​“reflected the direction the Democratic Party establishment has taken, away from working-class issues since the advent of neoliberal policies in the 1970s and carried out by most Democratic Party presidents since.” Historian Harvey J. Kaye, professor emeritus at the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay, took aim at the Democratic Party on social media Wednesday, noting failures to stand up to billionaires, raise the minimum wage, and pass the Richard L. Trumka Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act. Morris Pearl, chair of the Patriotic Millionaires and a former managing director at BlackRock, said in a Wednesday statement that ​“a self-avowed authoritarian successfully wielded the economic frustrations of millions to win the most consequential election of our nation’s history. The Democratic establishment has only itself to blame.” “Voters demanded a fundamental overhaul of a rigged economic system. When neoliberal Democrats dithered, Donald Trump offered to clear the board, and voters chose the dark unknown rather than the status quo,” Pearl added. ​“The only question remaining is, why are Democrats surprised? This is the entirely predictable result of a multi-decade strategy to appease the rich that met no serious resistance.” The Sunrise Movement — a youth-led climate group that worked to reach millions of young voters in swing states to defeat Trump — similarly stressed on social media Wednesday that ​“last night’s results were a call for change. Millions of people are fed up after living through decades of a rigged economy and corrupt political system. They are looking for someone to blame. It’s critical the Dem Party takes that seriously.” “For decades, Democrats have prioritized corporations over people. This is the result. Every working American feels the crisis. We can’t pay rent. Our government can’t pass basic legislation. The WEATHER has turned against us. And Dems look us in the eye and say it’s fine,” the group continued. ​“Trump loves corporations even more than Democrats do, but he ran an anti-establishment campaign that gave an answer to people’s desire for change.” “We can stop him, and we must,” Sunrise said of Trump. ​“But it’s going to take many thousands of people taking to the streets and preparing to strike. And it’s going to take mass movements putting out a better vision for our country than Trumpism and proving that we can make it happen.” This article was originally published by Common Dreams.

Title: Bitcoin surges as backers bet Donald Trump’s election will bring crypto into the mainstream

Photo: Getty Bitcoin jumped to a record high, part of a wave of trades across global markets in response to Donald Trump emerging victorious over Democratic rival Kamala Harris in the US presidential election. The largest digital asset rose as much as 9pc to $75,372 (€70,391) as early results showed Mr Trump barrelling towards a win. It traded at just below $74,000 as of 10:40am yesterday morning as networks declared Mr Trump had won the race, setting him up for a second term in the White House. The last peak was in March, when investors were cheered by inflows into US bitcoin exchange-traded funds. Bitcoin is viewed by many as a so-called Trump trade because the former president embraced digital assets during his campaign after a major push by the industry. Crypto muscled onto the high table of politics by deploying a giant campaign-finance war chest to further its agenda. Mr Trump vowed to make the US the crypto capital of the planet, create a strategic bitcoin stockpile and appoint regulators who love digital assets. Ms Harris adopted a more measured approach, pledging to support a regulatory framework for the industry. In contrast, the Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) under the Biden administration pursued a crackdown via a flurry of enforcement actions. Donald Trump holds hands with former first lady Melania Trump after speaking to supporters in West Palm Beach (Lynne Sladky/AP) "The crypto industry feels like it's been operating with one hand tied behind its back for years, and it senses that might be coming to an end," said Matthew Hougan, chief investment officer of Bitwise Asset Management. "People are starting to position for the next few years in crypto." In Ohio, Republican car dealer and blockchain entrepreneur Bernie Moreno beat Democratic incumbent and Senate Banking Chair Sherrod Brown for a senate seat. Crypto titans spent some $40m to defeat Mr Brown – a long-time sceptic of the industry – underlining the influence of their political outlays. The crypto industry feels like it's been operating with one hand tied behind its back for years The prospect of friendlier US crypto rules led to gains across the digital-asset market. Second-ranked token Ether added about 8pc. Dogecoin, a meme-crowd favourite promoted by Trump supporter Elon Musk, rallied 31pc at one point. Digital-asset companies often complained that officials under President Joe Biden failed to create a clear new legal framework for the nascent market. SEC Chair Gary Gensler said existing rules apply and repeatedly labelled the sector as rife with fraud and misconduct. The agency cracked down on crypto following a 2022 market rout that triggered a litany of collapses, notably the bankruptcy of Sam Bankman-Fried's fraudulent FTX exchange. "The first test of [Trump’s] credibility to watch out for is whether he will deliver on his promise to fire Gensler on his first day in office," said Le Shi, Hong Kong managing director at market making firm Auros. Bitcoin has now advanced 75pc in 2024, topping assets such as stocks and gold. US spot-bitcoin ETFs, from issuers such as Blackrock and Fidelity Investments, have attracted $23.5bn of net inflows following their launch at the start of the year – among the most successful new ETFs in history.

BREAKING: Germany’s three-party ruling coalition collapsed after Chancellor Olaf Scholz announced he would fire his Finance Minister Christian Lindner over persistent disagreements about economic reforms. Full story: https://t.co/tTzoSsJIWQ pic.twitter.com/1fzQdqBge5 1 day ago | ivn, 530 comments 2 days ago | carolinalily, 5113 comments 5 days ago | frodo, 532 comments 5 days ago | bttrsondaughter, 390 comments 6 days ago | yami_no_hoshi, 161 comments i never go into these things hopeful. im always grim and ready to accept the loss. but this time i actually DID feel hopeful and like things might actually change. its making it double hard watching the us and germany go this way. i feel like an idiot for thinking problems would be solved, the world would possibly get a bit better, etc. Well, damn. Hearing some things are afoot in New Zealand too. What a horrible day. It's not a full on government collapse like Germany, but it does sound concerningly right wing https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/06/new-zealand-treaty-of-waitangi-founding-document-changes-bill-parliament And people want us to have hope for the world. How? Genuinely how? florence + the machine really weren't lying when she sang "i'm always in this twilight" I had a genuine thought today when I went out to the orthodontist and to get cat food and saw people with Trump flags on their cars and wearing all their MAGA merch that maybe it's time to get a gun, especially since my pit bull died and she did a damned good job of being threatening to anyone looking the wrong way at my house. That's the mental state I'm in right now, especially since I live in a rural part of the south (albeit NC which needs to figure out if they're Republican or Democrat because elected Trump and then Democrats for statewide office ???). I'm thinking of all the women opting out of dating/marrying/sleeping with men (I'm never letting one of those filthy devils touch me ever again) and the potential increase of SA from frustrated men. I'm def considering a gun. Ugh we really are living in a repeat of the 1920s/30s. Lindner was basically blocking every good idea the Dems/Greens had and only thought about himself and his rich party friends. He always had the least support in the polls but acted like HE was the leader. Basically a toddler, "if it doesn't go my way I'm not doing it".This was probably the outcome he wanted because he was already cuddling with the conservatives the past months. He's hoping that he will somehow make it in the parliament again next election and can form a coalition with them. Lindner is an ass and intentionally sabotaged the whole thing from the start. He wants to be part of the government but he also wants to be the one who is in charge which he obviously wouldn't be as the smallest partner in a coalition of 3 parties. So he's also playing opposition to his own coalition and basically keeping them hostage every time they have to figure out the finances. And now we've reached the point where SPD and Greens had enough. Scholz gave a speech that was a basically a big "fuck this guy!" explaining why he fired him for the good of the country. I guess it's now because we'd have elections next year anyway and the proposed timeline would only move things forward 6 months. I think in a way it's also a bit of a last-ditch effort to save face for Scholz, because he was a pretty weak leader. The coalition definitely struggled thanks to Lindner, but Scholz didn't do anyone any favours by not reigning him in earlier.

Title: Neuralink Rival Precision Neuroscience Raises $93 Million

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. (Bloomberg) -- Precision Neuroscience Corp., a brain implant rival to Elon Musk’s Neuralink Corp., has raised $93 million of a planned $100 million funding round, according to a person familiar with the situation. The deal valued the startup at about $500 million. Most Read from Bloomberg Paris Restricts Through Traffic in City Center From Housing to Immigration, Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races to Follow Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races Highlight Views on Abortion, Immigration The fresh fundraising gives the company a boost as it seeks to take on Neuralink, which has raised over $685 million, and other companies in the space including Science, which has raised $150 million. A spokeswoman for Precision declined to comment. A Securities and Exchange Commission filing shows the company had filed to raise as much as $150 million. Precision was founded in 2021 by neurosurgeon Ben Rapoport, a co-founder of Neuralink, and Chief Executive Officer Michael Mager. Last year, it raised $41 million. Startups working on brain implants and related technology, or brain-machine interfaces, have gained considerable momentum in recent months. Neuralink’s device went into its first human patient as part of a trial earlier this year. And a team at the University of California, Davis, implanted an ALS patient with a device that allowed him to speak via a machine with unprecedented accuracy by reading his brain signals. Precision’s device is called the Layer 7 Cortical Interface, referring to the six layers that comprise the cerebral cortex, and represents a compromise between invasive and noninvasive brain-computer interface technologies. It requires surgery and slicing into the skull, but not into the tissue of the brain. Instead, the device sits on top of the organ, a method the company says avoids damaging any of that brain’s tissue. That’s a contrast with devices from companies including Blackrock Neurotech, Inbrain Neuroelectronics SL, Neuralink and Paradromics, which sit within brain tissue. A device from Synchron enters the brain like a stent, via blood vessels, and ultimately sits near the brain’s motor cortex. Another company, Science, says it’s working on devices that can sit both on or in brain tissue. Precision’s device is not yet greenlit by regulators, but it is in testing. The startup has implanted its device in several patients, albeit temporarily during surgeries, where the primary purpose was related to another goal, such as removing brain tumors. While the surgery is underway and with the patient’s permission, the Precision team puts its Layer 7 in place and uses it to detect neurological signals. The company has applied for Food and Drug Administration approval of a version of its device for temporary use for monitoring in hospital settings, and has said it hopes to have it on the market next year. That would provide a revenue stream to the fledgling company as it works on its other device: a permanent implant to treat paralysis. Such a device, if it works, is years from approval and commercial deployment. In a recent surgery at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, Precision tested placing four of its microelectrode arrays — each one-fifth the thickness of a human hair — on the surface of a patient brain. Each array contains 1,024 electrodes, so deploying four arrays gives a total of 4,096, creating an unusually high level of detail. Competitors have far fewer. Neuralink’s device, for example, has 1,024 electrodes.

Last week I had the privilege to attend the inaugural New York BCI Symposium, a one-of-a-kind gathering that validated the astonishing popular appeal of BCI by spotlighting the field’s future opportunities and present-day limitations. The heady lineup featured over thirty experts including researchers, neurosurgeons, founders, advocates, and federal leaders, drawing a packed house of attendees spanning students, clinicians, investors and executives from around the world. Aligned in our common curiosity and interests, we mingled and traded perspectives on all things BCI. The two-day event was co-hosted by Mount Sinai BioDesign and the Department of Neurosurgery at the Icahn School of Medicine at the New York Academy of Medicine. Presentations spanned key discussions in breakthrough methods, commercial strategy, ethics, and research initiatives. Speakers represented numerous programs from Mount Sinai’s network of interdisciplinary departments for brain health, suggesting that the world’s leading neurotech innovation ecosystem might be developing at New York City’s biggest hospital system. Mount Sinai Health System's world-class neurotech ecosystem is foundational for the future of BCI. But the hosts transcended an empire state of mind, inviting experts from competing New York hospitals, and brain trusts from Boston, Pittsburgh, Baltimore, London, and the Netherlands. Such cross-pollination has been essential to the BCI field thus far, and serves as a testament to the collegial leadership of Dr. Joshua Bederson. As the system chair of neurosurgery and executive director of the biodesign program at Mount Sinai, Bederson’s earnest emceeing centered humility over hype and set the tone for two days of collaborative learning and discussion. The two BCI sponsors of the event, Synchron and Precision Neuroscience, offered dual visions of what an “interface” can be across numerous sessions. Synchron’s strategy bets on speed over size. Their minimally invasive Stentrode, whose endovascular insertion time is down to just 20 minutes, reliably translates signals into digital motor outputs to navigate a growing ecosystem of applications. Despite a relatively modest 16-channel array, Synchron’s focus on pragmatism and execution has garnered valuable respect and mindshare among neurosurgeons, federal officials, and the investor community. As an earlier stage company, Precision has chosen to optimize for the future over the immediate-term. Their “Layer 7” thin film array has 1024 electrodes in a flexible device that conforms to the cortex. While it has only been used in exploratory studies thus far, implantations will occur via a <1mm incision; once made the “micro-electrocorticography” array (micro-ECoG) will take about 20 seconds to place. The ability to record and stimulate at a field-leading volume will take longer to arrive in market, but likely offer greater options to build value for users when it does. Precision Neuroscience and Synchron anchored the symposium as sponsors Here are my top five sessions (actually, seven) focused on the most critical characters in the evolving narrative about BCI’s future: Brain health experts who founded companies to translate research and transform practice, and the early group of end users who’ve had actual skin in the game, known and celebrated as BCI Pioneers. Doug Weber, co-director at the NeuroMechatronics Laboratory at Carnegie Mellon University set the stage. His “why, what, how” history of major BCI milestones unfolded through six Pioneers’ stories, starting in 1996 with Marjorie Hirschberg, and continuing with with Phil Kennedy, Matt Nagle, Jan Scheurmann and Ian Burkhart, before stopping in 2015 with Nathan Copeland, who remains the world’s longest actively implanted (and most artistically prolific) user. Doug Weber from Carnegie Mellon kicked off the Symposium with an overview of BCI Pioneers and key ... [+] milestones. Weber also leveraged his broad industry experience as co-founder and CTO of Reach Neuro and advisor to numerous neurotech startups to frame two major challenges: First is accurately defining the market, which will involve validating and benchmarking outcomes against current alternatives for end users. Second is the umbrella of ethical, legal, social implications (ELSI) posed by real world adoption. This spans a diverse, cross-functional, and challenging mix of topics including data and device security, user agency, accessibility, equitability, policy reforms and more. While digital device control, a primarily “read” use case, remains the first focal area for most commercial BCI, efficacy trials are still needed “to understand where specific benefits are, and how uniform they are across a population,” which payers will require for reimbursement considerations. Weber also spoke to movement disorders, mental illness, and stroke recovery as expansion markets that could combine BCI with neuromodulation (“write.”) Across subsequent tracks, it became evident that the post-research, read-and-write future of BCI is not that far away. Chad Bouton, a professor and VP of Advanced Engineering at Northwell Health’s Feinstein Institutes, presented a case study on “neural bypass.” This procedure pairs spinal cord stimulation and BCI to produce cortical mirroring around the site of injury. By exciting or “priming” the spinal cord, this approach can create enough neural plasticity to restore limited sensations, and enhance physical therapy and rehabilitation to improve strength and motor control for people who have lost independence through injury. Today, this remains a research effort requiring highly personalized surgical interventions and rehabilitation, rather than any off-the-shelf options. In response to a question about where neural bypasses will be in five years, Bouton emphasized his lab’s research focus to “promote plasticity any way we can” and the need for a commercial ecosystem of wearable stimulation with onboard AI that can pair with BCI systems and work from users’ homes. The subject of Bouton’s case study, Keith Thomas, who became paralyzed from the chest down after a diving accident, was in the room with his sister to receive a rousing round of applause. In a brief chat with Bouton, Thomas and his sister after the session, I was moved by the trio’s banter and the depth of their connection, and grateful for the siblings’ candid input when asked how BCI could better serve users and caregivers today. I’ll explore this critical topic in future articles. David Putrino, PhD, a professor at Mount Sinai’s Icahn School of Medicine, opened this session with an overview of his lab’s approach to “rehabilitation and human performance.” This involves partnering with patients to adopt and adapt various neurotechnologies as part of active treatment, as well as working with regulatory agencies and payors to promote patient access outside of research settings. Putrino contrasted the impairment-focused medical model of disability with the social model, which works to remove or mitigate barriers to human performance. In this frame, BCI is arriving at a crossroads moment, wherein innovation is expanding from compensation (e.g. water bottle grippers for people without finger control) to restoration through things like functional electrical stimulation. He was joined on the stage by Christopher Kellner, MD, an associate professor of Neurosurgery who oversees various programs in care delivery, research, and training in the field of intracerebral care. Kellner’s work entails use of numerous FDA-cleared neurotechnologies, from implanted devices for vagus nerve stimulation, to wearable sleeves paired with a non-invasive brain interface. David Putrino and Christopher Kellner's cross-functional, interdisciplinary collaboration spanning ... [+] neurotech, neurosurgery, PT & Rehab, and arm-wrestling insurers has helped patients like Katie regain functional independence after a stroke. The highlight of the track was hearing from a patient named Katie, who worked with both Kellner and Putrino to regain independence after a devastating stroke in 2019 left her paralyzed down her left side. Only in her early 30’s with a two year old at home, Katie was hospitalized for five months during the Covid-19 pandemic, which involved intensive physical, occupational, and speech therapy, which helped but still left her with limited arm strength at discharge. After two years of haggling with three different insurers, Katie gained access to Medicare which enabled her to join Kellner’s trial for a vagus nerve stimulation implant. She described the surgery as “not bad,” the six weeks of additional rehab as “you get out what you put in,” and the treatment as “life-changing,” adding that “you can feel your brain rewiring, you can feel the neuroplasticity.” With her young daughter in the audience watching her mom on stage, Katie’s story represents both the possibilities of neurotech-enabled stroke care today, and the fiendish limitations too many Americans face from their health plans. It struck that Mount Sinai’s collaborative, interdisciplinary, tech-savvy, and practically oriented clinical model remains an exception rather than a norm compared to most health systems. The only thing better than watching videos of BCI Pioneers bending and breaking limits - speaking cybernetically, fistbumping presidents, playing games, making art - is hearing from them directly. Ian Burkhart took the stage numerous times to share his expert perspective as a liaison to the FDA, President of NASIC, philanthropic leader, published researcher, and all around advocate. In a chat with CNBC’s Ashley Capoot, he shared the story of his spinal cord injury and his clinical trial in 2014 that implanted him with a Blackrock Neuroport array. Seven years of clinical studies included a neural bypass procedure using technology from Battelle that temporarily reanimated his hand well enough to play Guitar Hero. In 2021, Burkhart was “explanted” when the trial’s funding ran out and a scalp infection developed around his implant. His perspective is that BCI represents an aspiration to deliver improvements over today’s available assistive technologies. When asked about wanting another BCI, he didn’t hesitate to say yes, but demurred that his eligibility remains in question due to prior history, and that now, “the bar is higher for what I would want.” At the top of his list are a fully implanted device to reduce odds of infection, a duration of at least ten years, and in-home functionality rather than limited access in the lab. Ian Burkhart & Ashley Capoot of CNBC spoke about how BCI can evolve from a research domain to a ... [+] field of patient care In another session, Burkhart joined Blair Casey, executive director of Team Gleason, and Jennifer French, MBA, for a nuanced discussion on the path forward in BCI. French lives with tetraplegia as a result of a snowboarding accident, and the extent of her neurotechnology advocacy and leadership cannot be understated. Her expertise founding and leading Neurotech Network, NASIC, and the iBCI-CC over the last decade were on display in a masterclass on pre-commercial strategy for the nascent BCI industry, from trust-building and hype mitigation, to functional indication roadmaps for people living with spinal cord injuries, to scaling community engagement for participation in clinical trials. Selling false hope about complete recovery and restoration via BCI should be avoided by all, and especially by my peers who work in media, marketing, and market research. Key trends for the industry to navigate include shrinking rehab times for spinal cord injury, low clinician awareness and access to new tech, and the need to “jump the chasm” from engaging people enrolled in BCI registries to engaging the broader community of those affected. Max Hodak, founder and CEO of Science Corp, shared their vision restoration pivotal trial, in which a photovoltaic stimulating array implanted at the back of blind patients’ retinas, paired with special eyeglasses, restored the ability to see for the vast majority of the trial’s 38 participants. The implant, acquired in a commercial chess move this spring, is a solar-powered marvel the size of confetti that fits perfectly over Abe Lincoln on a penny’s tail. Through the company’s foundry and a new full stack of BCI tools, Science could bring the cost of in-human BCI development down by a factor of 20. Hodak’s broader vision for BCI is grounded yet groundbreaking. Hodak was joined on the stage by Precision Neuroscience’s CSO Ben Rapoport, Synchron’s CEO Tom Oxley, Blackrock Neurotech’s CSO Florian Solzbacher, Paradromics’ CSO Vikash Gilja and and Meta’s (formerly co- founder of CTRL-Labs) Patrick Kaifosh. Moderated by Bloomberg Reporter Sarah McBride, the discussion covered a number of emerging industry tensions: standardizing outputs from differentiated systems, collaboration versus competition, demonstrating value to patients versus payors, and prioritizing technical optimization versus real world pragmatism in allocating limited time and money. Regulatory strategy, payer and clinician engagement, and AI filled a bulk of the Q&A. The diversity of technologies, form factors, invasiveness, user base and other factors limited the depth and generalizability of this conversation, but two key themes emerged: the need to focus on effective productization over technical perfection, and the tailored approach to designing clinical outcomes. The latter will make standardization in this nascent industry a challenge (more on that below.) In conversation on AI’s role in BCI, participants summarized technical advances in ML for signal processing or deep learning for chip design, as well as generative AI. LLMs can match or mimic the “art of human expression” as part of a product, or speed up the pdf-laden burdens of regulatory compliance, quality assurance, and other mission-critical operational obligations in building a class III medical device company. Based on the brainpower and leadership on this stage, the future of the industry appears in good hands. From left to right: Sarah McBride (Bloomberg), Ben Rapoport (Precision), Tom Oxley (Synchron), ... [+] Florian Solzbacher (Blackrock), Vikash Gilja (Paradromics), Patrick Kaifosh (CTRL Labs/Meta), Max Hodak (Science) Many if not most of the sessions I attended began by summarizing BCI history, underscoring the robust foundation of knowledge, tools, and practice that clinical researchers have built for the last two decades. But even as scores of brilliant neuroengineers advance technical innovations and test experimental interventions in research settings, the various experts on stage echoed the plain view that industry is the engine that will drive this field forward for the next two decades, for better or for worse. The BCI Industrial Revolution is Underway (from Doug Weber's opening session) This set up the billion dollar question: What will the future hold for BCI startups? According to investors, it’s actually hundreds of billions. Alex Morgan, partner at Khosla Ventures and investor in Synchron and other neurotech startups, framed the opportunity as an unprecedented convergence of historic advances in measurement, materials and other technologies, from AI to AR and much in between. In a later session, Dr. Benjamin Rapoport of Precision Neuroscience referred to this confluent phenomenon as “Moore’s Law for Applied Neuroscience,” with a growth curve mapping electrode channel count over the last 50 years. In Morgan’s words, BCI (and other non-implanted neurotech) “will give us a fine-grained attenuation of the electrical network in the manner we want, when we want.” Thus, he argued, if the 20th century was the century of the heart, where a similar multi-faceted revolution in cardiology innovation now “creates over $300b in value a year” by augmenting lifespan and healthspan, then the 21st century will belong to the brain. But as we enter the second quarter of the century, the BCI industry today has yet to put any points on the board, in terms of adding economic value to people’s lives. Khosla Ventures' Alex Morgan framed the convergence of neurotechnology innovation as the Century of ... [+] the Brain. One attendee I met at lunch smirked that BCI appears to be a solution looking for a problem, a view plenty of others share. I’ve personally met or heard from too many BCI Pioneers to agree. His point was well-taken though, that reimbursement is hard, and navigating the market opportunity comes down to a specific (if daunting) set of “known unknowns” that emerged over the two days. A mentor of mine, Dr. Jordan Shlain, cautions against mistaking a clear view for a short distance. Simply put, the road ahead will be hard. Advancing the field of BCI will depend on several factors that emerged over multiple sessions, as well as the new reality of highly unpredictable federal leadership, whose impact over the next four years at FDA, CMS, and other agencies remains to be seen. As per David McMullen, the FDA’s director of the office of neurological & physical medicine devices, regulatory science at the agency entails “developing new tools, standards, and approaches to assess the safety and performance of the products it regulates.” His new boss, Michele Tarver, has a history of patient-centered public-private partnerships. McMullen divulged his career-long interest in BCI prior to joining the feds and listed numerous efforts underway to engage BCI stakeholders and, in particular, accelerate market success through TAP (“FDA Breakthrough on steroids”), specific funding mechanisms, and aligning COA. Jen French also identified informing regulatory science as a key goal of the iBCI-CC, describing the group’s work as a “pre-competitive sandbox” to develop technical and clinical standards, user preferences, endpoints economic analysis. These efforts are bolstered by the work of researchers like Abbey Sawyer, a postdoctoral fellow who shared her work in developing digital “activities of daily living” to leverage clinical trials for broader impact. Abbey Sawyer shared insights about how to measure the impact of BCI in clinical research. And yet: Despite the bonhomie, mutual respect, and promising rhetoric, the reality is that alignment will be challenging. In the BCI startup panel, after describing how nuances in product and procedures will drive differences in trial design and clinical outcomes, Tom Oxley summed it up: “Everyone wants to do something slightly different.” Persuading payers to cover BCI will undeniably become the field’s top goal. McMullen’s counterpart on the symposium’s closing panel was TJ Sutphin, Ombudsman for Pharma and Tech at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid. Sutphin also spoke at the aforementioned COA session for BCI last month. His primer covered coding and coverage channels, “innovator’s guide” resources, and touched on coverage decisions for speech generating devices, DBS, cochlear implants, and other topics. Despite the airtime, I felt that he offered little insight to CMS’s specific thinking about BCI. This is underscores the need to recruit health plan medical directors and commercial reimbursement leaders from Medtronic, Boston Scientific, or other neuromodulation companies to future discussions about BCI. The job of CMS, and to a lesser extent, FDA, is to be reactive to engagement from BCI companies, moreso than act as proactive partners. Mount Sinai has an opportunity - I would argue, an imperative - to leverage their market relationships as an experienced health system and invite their insurer counterparts into the room in future iterations of this event. This would amount to two-way opportunity for payers to educate attendees on their thought process and perspectives, and absorb key insights on the benefits and value of BCI from some of the world’s leading experts. Patient advocacy will bridge the divide between clinical research and commercial success. Across the two days, Pioneer voices and videos were elevated on the stage in a way that transcended marketing or storytelling; at this early stage, each and every BCI user represents a highly valuable and slightly different case study filled with technical, clinical, practical, and socioeconomic insights that remain largely underleveraged. Rather than asking Pioneers like Burkhart to repeat their stories, the field needs to lean on their detailed market research, numerous publications, federal advocacy efforts, strategic philanthropy, and other insights. Commercial success will require integrating BCI into smart homes, navigating limits of disability policy and routes to reimplantation, and improving ethics of clinical trials. An example of the latter came from Dan Rubin, Assistant Professor of Neurology at Harvard Medical School/Mass General, where BCI trial participants can “reconsent” twice, for up to an additional seven years of using their BCI following the end of their trial. Caregiver perspectives were infrequently mentioned in the sessions I attended. BCI cannot cure paralysis, so family members and caregivers have a critical role in expanding conversations on decentralizing clinical research, exploring economic evidence generation around time and costs, and configuring BCI for communication and in-home deployment. The latter was explored briefly by Mariska J. Vansteensel from UMC Utrecht Brain Center in a case study about “nocturnal caregiver calling” that drew questions from BCI executives in the audience, suggesting that such key explorations of daily living should not be relegated to academic research. Like the titles of many presenters, this recap has become a bit long, so I’ll close with a powerful framing by Peter Yoo, Synchron’s Senior Director of Neuroscience and Algorithms. In designing functional systems in dynamic interplay between hardware, software, and the end user, Yoo spoke about balancing reliability off the shelf, and adaptability to account for individual customization and technical advances: “This isn’t just a simple engineering challenge. When the human is in the loop, it impacts the whole system.” BCI then, is more than a field of research, a technology product or a commercial market. It’s a platform for optimizing the common boundaries of computers and human beings. The next era will not spin out from technical revolutions in a laboratory, but by helping people in their homes. Like the word BCI itself, it’s easier said than done. For all the students, engineers, doctors, executives, and others working in this field, the future is not just undeniably bright - it’s here.

Title: Trump win sparks big rally in stocks

Wall Street’s main indexes opened at record highs in anticipation of Trump’s pro-business approach. Donald Trump’s return as president of the United States for the second time has boosted equity markets on bets of lower corporate tax, favourable tariffs and deregulation, lifting shares of banks, locally focused small-cap companies and Trump Media. His promise to make Tesla CEO Elon Musk head of a government efficiency commission after the billionaire backed Trump throughout his electoral campaign led to a 12.5 percent surge in the shares of the electric carmaker. Wall Street’s main indexes opened at record highs, while the small-cap Russell 2000 index jumped about 4.8 percent to its highest in nearly three years. “Business animal spirits could be rekindled once again from Trump’s pro-business approach which could lead to a more robust capital expenditures and investment environment,” said Jeff Schulze, market strategist at ClearBridge Investments. Trump Media & Technology Group, in which Trump owns a majority stake rose nearly 8 percent in choppy trading. Investors overlooked the company’s latest quarterly results that showed the Truth Social parent’s revenue was just $1m. The shares have more than tripled in value from their all-time lows in late September, and Trump’s stake was worth as much as $5.3bn, up from $3.9bn on Tuesday. Trump’s Republican Party also secured the Senate and was making gains in the House of Representatives, potentially making it easier for the president to legislate his proposals and push through key appointments. Markets “have priced in a pretty strong mandate for the Republicans and are biasing towards most of the Trump trades”, said Scott Chronert, US equity strategist at Citi. “Policy details will be important for here as the market focus seems to be putting more emphasis on deregulation, tax cuts, and a more business-friendly backdrop.” Wall Street lenders JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Goldman Sachs jumped between 6 percent and 10 percent on prospects of improving domestic investment, looser regulations and more deals. “Trump’s win likely means some deregulation, including rolling back banking regulations, though Big Tech may remain a bipartisan antitrust focus,” strategists at BlackRock Investment Institute said in a note. Semiconductor stocks advanced, with the Philadelphia chip index rising 1.8 percent and AI darling Nvidia gaining 2.7 percent despite Trump’s criticism of the US CHIPS and Science Act, which supports domestic chip manufacturing through subsidies. Trump has instead proposed tariffs on imported chips, particularly from Taiwan’s TSMC, whose US-listed shares dropped 3 percent. Oil stocks firmed 3.5 percent, while US renewable energy companies such as NextEra Energy and First Solar plunged 6 percent and 13 percent, respectively. Trump’s campaign laid out an energy policy platform centred around maximising US fuel and power output, in part by dismantling the Biden administration’s efforts to fight climate change. While Tesla shares surged on Musk-Trump proximity, stocks of other electric carmakers dipped as Trump had said he would consider ending a $7,500 tax credit for EV purchases. Rivian Automotive dropped 8 percent and Nikola slipped about 1.4 percent. “Nobody is making money in EVs aside from Tesla, so the reduction or elimination of EV credits will widen Tesla’s competitive moat,” said Garrett Nelson, senior equity analyst at CFRA Research. Fears of escalation in Sino-US tensions pressured US-listed China shares with iShares MSCI China ETF dropping nearly 2.4 percent. Import duties, including a 10 percent universal tariff on imports from all foreign countries and a 60 percent tariff on imports from China, are a key plank of Trump’s policies and likely to have the biggest global impact. Victory for Trump, who has positioned himself as pro-cryptocurrency, lifted Bitcoin to a record high. Crypto-linked stocks Coinbase, MicroStrategy, Riot Platforms, MARA Holdings jumped between 11 percent and 21 percent. Private prison operators Geo Group and CoreCivic jumped about more than 30 percent each as Trump’s promised crack down on undocumented immigration could boost demand for detention centres. US steel makers Cleveland-Cliffs, Steel Dynamics and Nucor surged between 13 percent and 19 percent, with analysts having noted in the run-up to the election that a Trump presidency may mean rising protections for the domestic steel industry.

Damn, $IBIT has seen $1b in volume in the first 20min- that's about what it does in full day. Other bitcoin ETFs in same boat, crazy volume. Set for a record-breaking volume day (and given price is up so much, this is likely feeding frenzy volume vs crisis volume = look for… pic.twitter.com/1gSvV5Lwzo — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) November 6, 2024 At the time of writing, over $2.5 billion worth of IBIT shares traded hands, Coinglass data shows. Meanwhile, Fidelity’s FBTC saw around $464 million in volume, followed by Grayscale’s GBTC, per Coinglass. Trading volume, which represents both buying and selling activity, doesn’t directly translate to net inflows. For instance, of the $4.5 billion in first-day volume for Bitcoin ETFs, only about $600 million constituted actual inflows. Balchunas suggested that IBIT could end today with huge inflows. Historically, large volume spikes during a rally have often preceded significant inflows into Bitcoin ETFs, the analyst said. Remember the last time we saw volume spike during a rally? That was a precursor to the recent flow-athon, $IBIT alone took in $1.8b over next few days. Not saying it's guarantee but i'm fan of patterns and it fits pattern. https://t.co/YbkshZ5lOw — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) November 6, 2024 His projection was based on similar patterns observed on October 30, when IBIT’s trading volume surpassed $3.3 billion, which later converted into $643 million in net buying, Crypto Briefing reported. That marked the fund’s heaviest inflow since March 12 when Bitcoin neared $73,000. According to data tracked by Farside Investors, IBIT shed over $44 million yesterday. US spot Bitcoin ETFs also ended the day with approximately $117 million in net outflows, extending its losing streak to three consecutive days. The recent spike in IBIT trading comes amid Bitcoin’s price rally to around $74,400, up over 6% in the last 24 hours. Bitcoin recently established a new record high of $75,358 on CoinGecko. The milestone was achieved against the backdrop of the 2024 US elections, with projections indicating that Donald Trump was set to secure a second term in office. Trump’s victory was later confirmed as major media outlets, including FOX News, the Associated Press, and NBC, officially declared him the winner of the 2024 election.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We came across a bullish thesis on Garrett Motion Inc. (GTX) on Value Investing by Double Alpha Factory’s Substack by Maksim. In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on GTX. Garrett Motion Inc. (GTX)'s share was trading at $7.34 as of Nov 4th. GTX’s trailing and forward P/E were 6.02 and 5.95 respectively according to Yahoo Finance. A close up of an engine piston with a commercial turbocharger attached. Garrett Motion (GTX) operates as a key player in the mobility and industrial technology sector, focusing on high-performance turbocharging solutions for light vehicles, commercial vehicles, and industrial applications. Known for its mechanical and electrical turbo products, GTX caters to a broad spectrum of vehicle types, including gasoline, diesel, and natural gas engines, with some revenue now coming from its E-Boosting and hydrogen fuel cell compression solutions. As of 2023, GTX leads in turbochargers for internal combustion engines (ICEs), a critical technology that enables automakers to meet fuel efficiency and emission standards without sacrificing power or performance. This niche, heavily dominated by Garrett Motion and BorgWarner, has a high barrier to entry due to the technical complexity involved. Additionally, a significant portion of GTX's revenue is secured years in advance, with more than 80% of OEM sales planned four years ahead, providing solid visibility into future cash flows. Despite the auto industry's shift towards battery electric vehicles (BEVs), GTX’s turbo business remains resilient, with turbocharger penetration expected to exceed 50% in ICE-based vehicles through 2030. As BEV adoption has slowed due to infrastructure, cost, and consumer preference challenges, hybrids—where turbo penetration is even higher—are likely to account for a larger portion of future vehicles. This benefits GTX, as hybrids require more advanced turbo systems, which offer higher margins. Moreover, GTX’s commercial and industrial applications, such as backup power generators and marine engines, represent a significant growth area, accounting for about 30% of total sales and offering higher profitability than light vehicle applications. This segment continues to expand, especially in sectors like marine and backup power, where demand is surging due to their role in ensuring stable power for critical infrastructure, such as data centers. CEO commentary from recent earnings calls reflects GTX's confidence in the durability of its turbo business, which caters to both diesel and natural gas engines for high-demand applications like locomotives and off-highway vehicles. In terms of financials, GTX projects substantial free cash flow (FCF) generation over the next five years. Management estimates between $1.7 billion to $2.1 billion in FCF, with the lower end of this forecast still translating to a FCF yield of approximately 20% based on its current market capitalization of around $1.6-$1.7 billion. This robust FCF, along with GTX’s forward sales visibility, makes it likely that the company could repurchase its entire outstanding share base within five years, even after allocating around $0.5 billion toward new zero-emission technologies. Given the current 41% BEV penetration assumption in these projections—an aggressive forecast—GTX’s outlook could improve further if BEV adoption rates continue to lag. The slow pace of the BEV transition, noted at the 2024 J.P. Morgan Automotive Conference, reinforces the durability of GTX's revenue base, as the turbocharger market retains a long tail of demand. Recent discussions, including those from major industry events and political forums, highlight various challenges facing BEV adoption, such as prohibitive costs, consumer hesitancy, and infrastructure inadequacies. In Europe, for example, the ambitious goal to ban non-BEV vehicles by 2035 faces substantial resistance, with auto executives and government officials questioning the feasibility of such rapid changes. In the U.S., adoption rates for BEVs are likewise decelerating, as indicated by recent regulatory shifts to ease tailpipe standards. The Biden administration, for instance, reduced its BEV adoption targets amid political and industry feedback. Meanwhile, automakers are doubling down on hybrids, which offer a balance between emission reduction and operational efficiency. Companies like Ford and General Motors are pivoting to hybrids due to profitability concerns, reinforcing GTX’s position in the evolving vehicle mix. In China, EV manufacturers are increasingly exploring hybrid technologies, acknowledging the profitability and flexibility advantages of hybrid systems over pure BEVs. Garrett's sustained focus on hybrids and ICE solutions aligns well with these market shifts, positioning it as a critical supplier for automakers facing stringent efficiency mandates but limited by BEV scalability issues. From an investment perspective, Garrett Motion's (GTX) valuation is attractive, trading at a discount relative to its cash flow potential. With a market cap of approximately $1.6 to $1.7 billion, GTX is projected to generate $1.7 billion in free cash flow (FCF) over the next five years. This cash flow can be utilized for substantial stock buybacks, potentially enhancing shareholder value and driving the stock price higher. The company’s diverse revenue streams, particularly in expanding commercial and industrial applications, provide resilience amid uncertainties in the transition to battery electric vehicles (BEVs). In a worst-case scenario, investors can anticipate a 20% return over the next five years, followed by a 10% return in subsequent years, indicating a solid margin of safety. Comparatively, GTX's closest competitor, BorgWarner, trades at free cash flow yields of around 8-10%, about half of GTX’s yield. This difference implies a potential upside of 50-100% for GTX if the market aligns its valuation with that of BorgWarner. The investment thesis is based on GTX's strong market position, ongoing demand for internal combustion engines (ICE) and hybrid vehicles, clear revenue visibility, diversification into high-margin industrial applications, and robust free cash flow generation. Collectively, these factors underscore GTX's status as an undervalued entity with significant upside potential, particularly if the transition to BEVs is slower than anticipated. Garrett Motion Inc. (GTX) is not on our list of the 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 32 hedge fund portfolios held GTX at the end of the second quarter which was 35 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the risk and potential of GTX as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GTX but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Fundamentally Strong Penny Stocks to Invest In. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Luk Fook Holdings (International) Limited (OTC:LKFLF) stands against the other fundamentally strong penny stocks. As per Royce Investment Partners, small caps saw a rebound in Q3, exhibiting a strong advance on both an absolute and relative basis. As per the investment management firm, the Russell 2000 Index saw an increase of ~9.3% in Q3 2024, surpassing the large-cap Russell 1000 Index (which rose ~6.1%) and the mega-cap Russell Top 50 Index (which increased ~4.2%). The investment firm believes that small caps see a long road back to the top, with large caps holding a commanding lead through the initial 9 months of 2024. On a YTD basis, the Russell 2000 saw an increase of ~11.2% compared to the respective gains of ~21.2% and ~27.3% for the Russell 1000 and Russell Top 50, in the third quarter of 2024. The investment firm said a confluence of factors might support small-caps in sustaining market leadership. The still-growing US economy, together with a more typical interest rate environment, might support small-cap leadership. As per Russell Investments, the US equity-market leadership reversed during Q3 2024, with small-cap stocks surpassing the returns delivered by their large-cap counterparts. Also, the value factor outperformed the growth factor. This means there was a significant pivot from the first 2 quarters of 2024, during which market returns were dominated by the US large-cap growth stocks— the Magnificent 7, to be precise. Russell Investments highlighted that, from Q2 2024 to Q3 2024, there was a moderate change in the US average daily turnover, with $578.8 billion in Q3 2024 as compared to $581.5 billion in Q2 2024. Q3 2024 saw a shift in investor focus from high-flying tech stocks to more traditional sectors. Small-cap and value stocks surpassed the performance of large-cap and growth stocks, thanks to the broader market rotation. Moreover, utility stocks saw significant traction due to higher investments in energy infrastructure in a bid to support the elevated demand from AI and data centers.

Wall Street experts believe that the shifts in monetary policy, sectoral innovation and developments, a favorable interest rate environment, and supportive regulatory environment are expected to fuel growth in small and emerging stocks over the next year. As per Francis Gannon, Co-Chief Investment Officer, and Managing Director of Royce Investment Partners, earnings form the foundation for long-term performance. This means that earnings tend to support the broader market over the long term. He noted that the Russell 2000 saw a near-record number of companies having no earnings, with a total of ~44.6% (as of September end). Despite this, the earnings growth for the small-cap companies that have them has been estimated to be higher than large-cap ones in 2025. Chuck Royce, Founder and Senior Advisor at Royce Investment Partners, believes that the lower rates are expected to help the M&A activity. The potential buyers have been waiting for the US Fed to act before they go ahead with acquisitions. He believes that many small-caps want to get merged. Therefore, there are expectations of more strategic buyouts moving forward. Our Methodology To list the 10 Best Fundamentally Strong Penny Stocks to Invest In, we used Finviz and Yahoo screeners to extract stocks trading under $5. Next, we selected the companies that have reliable 3-year revenue and 3-year net income growth rates. Finally, the stocks were arranged in ascending order of their hedge fund holdings, as of Q2 2024.

The company continues to focus on cost efficiency and store optimization and remains well-placed to manage potential rental cost hikes.

We recently published a list of 15 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against other trending AI stocks on the latest analyst ratings and news. The AI Boom in Big Tech is showing no signs of slowing down any time soon. This past week, artificial intelligence was the key focus for the Big Five, which together are valued at more than $10 trillion. The reporting season not only highlighted the push these big tech companies are making in AI investments but also demonstrated that they aren’t afraid to take it up any further than they already have. Previously, concerns regarding the returns from substantial AI investments had led to negative investor sentiment and even triggered a sell-off in major AI plays. However, some results are demonstrating that AI investments may be worth the wait.

As long as that infrastructure continues to be built, then we continue to be in a good place for the broader AI trade”. That said, executives of the major AI plays have fair-warned that their AI splurges will continue next year. Tech giants are racing to secure high-end chips and build sprawling data centers, forging partnerships with energy providers and much more. Each company wants to prove to Wall Street that these investments will eventually lead to greater profitability as compared to their current businesses. Ray Wang, principal analyst and founder at Constellation Research, believes that only a handful of technology names will be able to come out at the top, especially considering the high costs related to AI. This makes the situation quite favorable for well-capitalized companies. As companies ramp up their spending on AI, let’s take a closer look at how other AI players are advancing to make headlines. For starters, Perplexity, an AI conversational search engine that uses large language models to answer queries, has announced a dedicated hub for US general election information. Even though the AI-powered search engine has been seen to hallucinate from time to time, the company is keen on showing its trustworthiness when it comes to tracking election results. “Starting Tuesday, we’ll be offering live updates on elections by leveraging data from The Associated Press so you can stay informed on presidential, senate, and house races at both a state and national level. Thank you to Democracy Works for granting us access to your Elections API to help power these experiences.” The company’s election hub provides answers to election-related questions, as well as AI-generated analyses on ballot measures, policy stances, candidates, and endorsements. In other news, Noma Security, a stealth mode startup specializing in Enterprise, Cyber Security, and Artificial Intelligence, is said to be developing tools to identify vulnerable data pipelines and code in data science environments, as well as threats like prompt injection attacks. “Existing tools are designed for the traditional software lifecycle. However, the data and AI lifecycle is inherently different. It involves distinct R&D processes, relies on different technologies, and faces unique technical vulnerabilities within AI models.” Talking about the AI pioneer OpenAI, reports from Bloomberg state that the company is in talks with California’s attorney general’s office about the process of becoming a for-profit entity. While a shift to being a for-profit company would mark a drastic reversal in the governance structure for the company, the move would also make the firm more attractive to investors. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.

Stephen Yiu, chief investment officer of Blue Whale Growth Fund, has similar views on the stock. He said that Meta stands out as the only stock in the Magnificent 7 group apart from Nvidia when it comes to artificial intelligence investments. “We really think Meta could be a net winner on the back of this AI spending,” Overall, META ranks 2nd on our list of trending AI stocks on the latest analyst ratings and news.

Title: PAC free to investigate MAHB sale, says Transport Minister

Wednesday, 06 Nov 2024 KUALA LUMPUR: Transport Minister Anthony Loke said he has no qualms if the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) investigates the sale of Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd (MAHB) shares to a company linked to BlackRock. He said that the ministry, through the Malaysian Aviation Commission (Mavcom), is only focused on regulating competition in the industry. "If the PAC chairman Datuk Mas Ermieyati Samsudi wants, she may call for a meeting any time to review the deal's details. "Mavcom only looks into industry dealings from a regulatory perspective ... (and) has no say in its equity distribution. "Eventhough Mavcom is under the ministry's purview, I am not directly involved in its decision making as meetings are attended by its own board members, and the decisions they make are independent and objective based on their mandate to regulate the industry," Loke told Parliament during his ministry's winding down speech of Budget 2025 on Wednesday (Nov 6). Loke was responding to concerns raised by Mohd Radzi Md Jidin (PN-Putrajaya) over the sale of MAHB's shares to a foreign company, with the latter demanding why MAHB shares could not have been sold to local investors. This comes after Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), along with the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, planned to buy a 30% stake in MAHB's privatisation move. The deal was criticised by Opposition politicians after it emerged that GIP is in talks to be sold to BlackRock, a firm that is reported to have investments in Israel.

Title: Puttshack’s Technological Twist On Mini-Golf Hits 20 Locations

The view inside a Puttshack location Putt-putt, an amusement partaken by seven-to-seventy-year-olds may conjure memories of analog-fun—ramps leading into clown mouths and windmills with blades guarding the path to the hole that your opponent would have to spin to get turning. But to younger generations, a digitally enhanced version is fast becoming par for the course. Puttshack, a fast-growing eatertainment name, has just opened the doors on its 20th location in Dunwoody, Georgia, their second venue in the Atlanta GTA. The high-tech concept which received a $150 million capital infusion from BlackRock two years-ago, ditches miniature pencils and scorecards for their proprietary Trackaball technology, where the ball itself keeps tabs on players’ strokes and tabulates scores. “It knows the difference between you hitting the ball, and the ball hitting features on the course and so much to my children’s chagrin, you can’t actually cheat in the game so it does take some elements out of the traditional mini golf I remember as a kid,” CEO Logan Powell explained. Unlike traditional golf where were the lower your tally the better, scoring is via a modified Stableford system of sorts, with points awarded for birdies, pars and hole-in-ones, yet also subtracted for rolling into a hazard. There’s almost a pinball dynamic at play, with “supertube” markers on each hole that if hit, gush up point totals, setting the stage for plenty of lead changes within a round, which is by design. Powell views the dynamic scoring system through the prism of competitive socializing and wanted to facilitate as many opportunities to turn a round, well around, as possible. “We wanted to make sure that if you want to make a comeback, it levels the playing field a little bit and I can tell you from experience that I can go from crushing it one round and play the same course and just do horribly. Having those fun innovations, which also build on themselves—if you hit multiple super tubes in a row you get extra bonus points—the game encourages you to build up streaks and really go after it,” Powell adds, that often at the wire, it’s still anybody’s game. Holes feature skateboard style half pipes, a take on Connect Four, a tribute to beer pong and a basketball hole where a robot defender attempts to prevent balls from dunking.Its fair to say that their philosophy on hole design, is to keep the creative wheels turning. “We have a phenomenal innovation team based out of the U.K. who design all of our holes and we have new ones we’re developing now. We wanted to take the fun, nostalgic aspects of mini golf that you would think of from playing the traditional game but elevate it to target the demographic that tends to come to our stores—the 21-39 year old crowd,” Powell said, adding that they like elements to be recognizable but then to add a technology twist. Less than a year ago, they introduced the Challenge Hole, a private mini-golf suite where couples and small groups could eat-drink-play in a single location while playing a variety of putting themed games including a spin on Nintendo’s Duck Hunt, the point and shoot classic currently celebrating its 40th anniversary. “The ducks go across a screen and there are slots to put the the ball into and you’re trying to hit the ducks,” Powell explained, adding that reserving the Challenge Hole is popular for date nights. Addison, Texas is the beta test for the product and they plan to offer it as well in future locations, though a decision to retrofit existing locations to include one is still being considered. Puttshack’s main differentiating factor from other eatertainment concepts facilitating flatstick fun is how much it leans into technology. Though you find scorecards either at Puttery, which uses touchscreens to keep score or Tiger Woods’ Popstroke where an app is used to keep tallies and order food and drinks. The new Dunwoody location in Northern Atlanta, typifies the type of real estate sweet spots they scout for in order to hit their demographic trifecta—families, the corporate crowd and adults seeking an evening entertainment option. Domestically, locations average an ample 25,000 square feet and include dedicated private event space which get a lot of use over the holidays. “We typically target more urban locations, those hotspot areas within a market where you or your friends would think about going. When we think about a Puttshack location, it needs to be in an area where people tend to work, live, and play. We want to make sure we are in the consideration mix there,” Powell said. A group dining at a Puttshack location Beyond the mini-golf experience, the apps at Puttshack are as international as a Presidents Cup squad, offering shareables that range from Lebanese hummus and Korean bao buns to Thai fried chicken and Canadian-style poutine. Every location even has its own take on spring rolls—dubbed ‘tailpipes’—tailored to the local market. The Atlanta area locations feature fire-braised chicken, collard greens, and pimento cheese, served with BBQ and peach dipping sauces. Puttshack also gives back through its menu, with $1 of each tailpipe purchase supporting area charities. Their Boston location donates to the New England Center for Children, while the newly opened Dunwoody site supports Lost-n-Found, a local nonprofit that provides services to homeless LGBTQ+ youth. Powell expects the demand for experiential entertainment with friends, family and loved ones outside the home will continue to grow and welcomes new concepts pile into the space. “I think winners within the space will tend to have a technological competitive edge and that’s why we continue to innovate and make sure we have fresh ideas.” With only 20 units, Powell feels Puttshack is still merely scratching the surface in terms of expanding their footprint. On the near horizon, they have new stores in various stages of completion in the Minneapolis, Chicago and Fort Lauderdale areas and see plenty of opportunity to continue to expand in markets they already have a presence in, as they’ve done in Atlanta.

Title: Trump’s Presidency 2.0: Implications for the Cryptocurrency Industry and Global Markets

Donald Trump’s return to the U.S. presidency in 2024 marks a pivotal moment for the global cryptocurrency market. His administration’s anticipated pro-crypto stance has already sent shockwaves through the sector, with both immediate and long-term implications for digital assets, regulatory landscapes, and investor sentiment. Within hours of Trump’s victory, the cryptocurrency market experienced a significant rally: The market’s bullish response underscores the optimism surrounding Trump’s deregulatory approach. Institutional investors, hedge funds, and venture capitalists are expected to increase their crypto allocations, anticipating reduced regulatory scrutiny and enhanced market stability. Trump’s administration has signaled its intent to overhaul the current regulatory framework: This regulatory shift is likely to reverse the exodus of crypto companies from the U.S. Many firms, such as Coinbase and Binance US, may reconsider their expansion strategies and focus on scaling operations domestically. Trump’s broader economic policies could further impact the crypto market: Some analysts suggest that Trump’s pro-crypto policies could accelerate the shift towards Bitcoin as a digital reserve asset, particularly among emerging markets seeking to diversify away from the dollar. Trump’s policies are likely to create a more favorable environment for institutional players: The anticipated launch of user-friendly crypto products, such as ETFs and blockchain-based savings accounts, could drive retail adoption. Trump’s rhetoric on “financial freedom” resonates particularly well with younger investors, who see crypto as a means to achieve wealth independence. Trump’s crypto-friendly agenda could trigger a domino effect internationally: Despite the optimism, several risks could temper the market’s enthusiasm: The Trump administration’s policies could pave the way for a golden era in the crypto industry: Trump’s victory is more than a political shift—it represents a potential turning point for the cryptocurrency market. With deregulation, increased institutional participation, and a global race to adopt crypto-friendly policies, the stage is set for unprecedented growth. However, the road ahead will depend on the administration’s ability to balance innovation with oversight, ensuring a sustainable future for the digital economy.

Title: Trump Media, Tesla, and crypto stocks surge as Trump wins — and clean energy companies tumble

Donald Trump's victory in the presidential election boosted shares of his social media company, Elon Musk's Tesla, as well as cryptocurrencies and related stocks on Wednesday. The former president's reelection sent renewable-energy stocks tumbling in premarket trading as traders bet his administration would be less friendly in terms of subsidies and regulation. Shares of Trump Media & Technology Group surged as much as 62% to $55 as investors wagered Truth Social's parent company, which counts Trump as its largest shareholder, would benefit from his second term. The stock — which has Trump's initials, DJT, as its ticker — was trading 33% higher at last check. If the gain holds, Trump would be about $1.3 billion richer on paper given his near-53% stake in the company. Tesla stock rose as much as 15% in premarket trading and was poised to open at its highest level in more than a year. Musk, the electric-vehicle maker's CEO, has emerged as one of Trump's most vocal champions and closest advisors. If Tesla's overnight gain holds, Musk — already the world's richest person — would become $14 billion richer based on his roughly 13% stake. Bitcoin, the most popular crypto, climbed past $75,000 for the first time on election night before paring gains. Other digital coins including ethereum also jumped. Crypto stocks jumped on the prospect of a friendlier US regulatory environment under Trump. Coinbase and MicroStrategy both rose 13% ahead of the open. Conventional financial stocks also gained with Bank of America, JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, BlackRock, Blackstone, and KKR rising between 6% and 9% in the US premarket. Traders expect Wall Street banks, asset managers, and private equity firms to benefit from tax cuts and deregulation under Trump. In contrast, clean-energy stocks slid with Plug Power, SunRun, First Solar, and Enphase Energy all dropping at least 10% in premarket trading. Danish wind turbine manufacturer Orsted and rival Vestas fell 10% and 8% respectively in Frankfurt trading. The declines likely reflect concerns that Trump's reelection will lead to the repeal of the Inflation Reduction Act passed by the Biden administration, which provided large-scale tax credits for renewable-energy providers. The broader stock market gained before the open with futures underlying the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average climbing more than 2.3%, while Nasdaq 100 futures rose 1.8%.

Title: Bitcoin Hits Record as Pro-Crypto Trump Heads Toward US Victory

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. (Bloomberg) -- Bitcoin jumped to a record high, part of a wave of trades across global markets in response to Donald Trump emerging victorious over Democratic rival Kamala Harris in the US presidential election. Most Read from Bloomberg Paris Restricts Through Traffic in City Center Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races Highlight Views on Abortion, Immigration From Housing to Immigration, Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races to Follow The largest digital asset rose as much as 10% to $76,106 with Trump winning a second term, the Republicans taking back the Senate and the House looking increasingly more likely to remain red. The increase was the most since the last peak in March, when investors were cheered by inflows into US Bitcoin exchange-traded funds. Bitcoin is viewed by many as a so-called Trump trade because the former president embraced digital assets during his campaign after a major push by the industry. Crypto muscled onto the high table of politics by deploying a giant campaign-finance war chest to further its agenda. Trump vowed to make the US the crypto capital of the planet, create a strategic Bitcoin stockpile and appoint regulators who love digital assets. Harris adopted a more measured approach, pledging to support a regulatory framework for the industry. In contrast, the Securities & Exchange Commission under the Biden administration pursued a crackdown via a flurry of enforcement actions. “The crypto industry feels like it’s been operating with one hand tied behind its back for years, and it senses that might be coming to an end,” said Matthew Hougan, chief investment officer of Bitwise Asset Management Inc. “People are starting to position for the next few years in crypto.” In Ohio, Republican car dealer and blockchain entrepreneur Bernie Moreno beat Senate Banking Chairman Sherrod Brown. Crypto titans spent some $40 million to defeat Brown — a longtime skeptic of the industry — underlining the influence of their political outlays. The prospect of friendlier US crypto rules led to gains across the digital-asset market. Second-ranked token Ether added about 12%. Dogecoin, a meme-crowd favorite promoted by Trump supporter Elon Musk, rallied 31% at one point. Gensler’s Fate Digital-asset companies often complained that officials under President Joe Biden failed to create a clear new legal framework for the nascent market. SEC Chair Gary Gensler said existing rules apply and repeatedly labeled the sector as rife with fraud and misconduct. The agency cracked down on crypto following a 2022 market rout that triggered a litany of collapses, notably the bankruptcy of Sam Bankman-Fried’s fraudulent FTX exchange. “The first test of his credibility to watch out for is whether he will deliver on his promise to fire Gensler on his first day in office,” said Le Shi, Hong Kong managing director at market making firm Auros. Bitcoin has now advanced more than 80% in 2024, topping assets such as stocks and gold. US spot-Bitcoin ETFs, from issuers such as BlackRock Inc. and Fidelity Investments, have attracted $23.5 billion of net inflows following their launch at the start of the year — among the most successful new ETFs in history. --With assistance from Teresa Xie and Dave Liedtka.

Title: Bitcoin – Volatility reigns as election uncertainty spurs $541M in BTC ETF outflows

Could the inflows into BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF indicate a broader shift in investor sentiment towards Bitcoin ETFs? With the U.S Presidential election around the corner, the crypto market has seen a surge in volatility. Bitcoin [BTC] exchange-traded funds (ETFs), in particular, have felt the impact, with notable outflows observed on 1st and 4th November. With Election Day now here, uncertainty surrounding potential political shifts is continuing to add to the ups and downs of the Bitcoin ETF landscape. According to the latest data from Farside Investors on 4 November, Bitcoin ETFs recorded significant outflows – Totaling $541.1 million. Fidelity’s FBTC led the trend, with outflows hitting $169.6 million, followed closely by Ark 21Shares’ ARKB which saw $138.3 million in outflows. Grayscale’s BTC and Bitwise’s BITB also faced declines, with outflows of $89.5 million and $79.8 million, respectively. Grayscale’s GBTC recorded $63.7 million outflows too. Although most ETFs reported outflows, Invesco’s BTCO and WisdomTree’s BTCW stood out by maintaining stable flows without any outflows. Despite the broader downturn, however, not all updates were negative. BlackRock’s IBIT notably bucked the trend by attracting $38.4 million in inflows. Reflecting this optimism within the crypto community, Dr. Dinero shared a positive perspective, highlighting hopeful sentiment despite recent market turbulence. Source: Dr. Dinero/X Another X user noted, Source: Flip/X Looking at the cumulative data though, BTC ETFs have generated significant inflows since their launch, with volumes of $23 billion. Notably, BlackRock’s IBIT alone recorded $26 billion in inflows. Eric Balchunas, Bloomberg’s Senior ETF analyst, had previously forecasted that BTC ETFs might soon exceed the holdings attributed to Bitcoin’s creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. It was expected that these ETFs will reach this milestone by mid-December. However, a recent single-day purchase by BlackRock, totaling 12,127 BTC, has accelerated this timeline. In response to this significant accumulation, Balchunas shared his insights on X. He highlighted the swift momentum ETFs have gained in Bitcoin’s space. “At this rate, they’ll pass Satoshi in less than two weeks. Altho they can’t keep up this Joey Chestnut-level pace, can they?” This recent surge in Bitcoin ETF activity has coincided with notable price volatility in BTC itself. After touching $73,000 just days ago, Bitcoin has now dipped below the $70,000-threshold. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $68,807.31, following a slight 0.10% drop over the last 24 hours. On the weekly charts, it fell by over 3%. Thus, as election season adds an extra layer of uncertainty, the crypto market might be gearing up for further volatility in the coming days.

Speaking on the competitive dynamics, Kapoor said that while funding is important, it is not the sole determinant of long-term success, referencing examples of well-capitalised players in India who failed to establish a lasting presence. “Just having a lot of capital has not resulted in great businesses in India,” the official said, adding that success hinges on several other elements,” he said. - PTI “You need a strong ability to hire top technical talent, and that’s something traditional companies often struggle with.

Indian food-delivery platform Swiggy Ltd.’s $1.3 billion initial public offering was fully sold on the final day of bidding, though at a slower pace due to weak early demand from large investors. The listing, one of the few $1 billion-plus listings in India, drew bids for 1.3 times the shares set aside for foreigners and domestic money managers. The retail tranche was almost fully covered. For many, this IPO was seen as a test of whether the market still has an appetite for large first-time share sales after Hyundai Motor India Ltd.’s record $3.3 billion offer had a less-than-stellar debut. Swiggy’s offering also came at a time when global funds have been persistent sellers of local shares amid concerns about pricey valuations and slower earnings growth in India. Prosus NV-backed Swiggy’s offering includes a fresh issue of up to about 45 billion rupees ($535 million) and a sale of as many as 175.1 million shares by shareholders including venture-capital firm Accel and Tencent Cloud Europe BV. The company expects to list the shares by Nov. 13. Swiggy allocated 130.4 million shares worth 50.9 billion rupees ($605 million) to anchor investors at 390 rupees apiece, the top of the IPO’s price band, according to an exchange filing Tuesday. Anchor investors included global funds like Fidelity International and Invesco. In addition to contending with weak market sentiment, Swiggy’s losses may also have been be a sticking point for retail investors. The company posted a loss of 6.1 billion rupees ($73 million) for the three months ended June. Rival Zomato, which went public in 2021, reported a profit for the same period.

Reflecting on Swiggy’s experience in the evolving food delivery landscape, the company noted that agility and rapid decision-making are crucial to staying competitive. “Our orientation towards speed allows us to launch a new category quickly, while others might take months to finalize their plans,” the official explained, highlighting the company’s proactive approach in an industry where consumer expectations are high and competition is intense. The official highlighted the changing nature of the sector, noting that 10 years ago, the Indian food delivery market was crowded with players like Foodpanda, TinyOwl, and even global major Amazon. Many of these companies have since exited, unable to maintain traction, reflecting the challenges within the sector. “Our focus remains on understanding consumer needs and rapidly adapting to trends, which we believe provides us an edge, irrespective of who enters the market,” Kapoor stated. Quick Commerce remains a major growth potential with the industry growing at 60-80 per cent.

Zomato entered into “exclusivity contracts” with partners in return for lower commissions, while Swiggy guaranteed business growth to certain players if they listed exclusively on its platform, according to non-public documents prepared by the Competition Commission of India (CCI).

Indian food-delivery platform Swiggy Ltd.’s $1.3 billion initial public offering was fully sold on the final day of bidding, though at a slower pace due to weak early demand from large investors. The listing, one of the few $1 billion-plus listings in India, drew bids for 1.3 times the shares set aside for foreigners and domestic money managers. The retail tranche was almost fully covered. For many, this IPO was seen as a test of whether the market still has an appetite for large first-time share sales after Hyundai Motor India Ltd.’s record $3.3 billion offer had a less-than-stellar debut. Swiggy’s offering also came at a time when global funds have been persistent sellers of local shares amid concerns about pricey valuations and slower earnings growth in India. Prosus NV-backed Swiggy’s offering includes a fresh issue of up to about 45 billion rupees ($535 million) and a sale of as many as 175.1 million shares by shareholders including venture-capital firm Accel and Tencent Cloud Europe BV. The company expects to list the shares by Nov. 13. Swiggy allocated 130.4 million shares worth 50.9 billion rupees ($605 million) to anchor investors at 390 rupees apiece, the top of the IPO’s price band, according to an exchange filing Tuesday. Anchor investors included global funds like Fidelity International and Invesco. In addition to contending with weak market sentiment, Swiggy’s losses may also have been be a sticking point for retail investors. The company posted a loss of 6.1 billion rupees ($73 million) for the three months ended June. Rival Zomato, which went public in 2021, reported a profit for the same period.

In an interview to PTI, CEO Food of Swiggy, Rohit Kapoor, acknowledged the possibility of the entry of Jio into the hyperlocal delivery market as a competitor, but underscored that building a successful business in this sector requires more than just capital. Speaking on the competitive dynamics, Kapoor said that while funding is important, it is not the sole determinant of long-term success, referencing examples of well-capitalised players in India who failed to establish a lasting presence. “Just having a lot of capital has not resulted in great businesses in India,” the official said, adding that success hinges on several other elements,” he said. “You need a strong ability to hire top technical talent, and that’s something traditional companies often struggle with. Beyond talent, a deep understanding of the Indian consumer – something we’ve developed over a decade of experience in kitchens across the country – is essential,” Kapoor said. Reflecting on Swiggy’s experience in the evolving food delivery landscape, the company noted that agility and rapid decision-making are crucial to staying competitive. “Our orientation towards speed allows us to launch a new category quickly, while others might take months to finalize their plans,” the official explained, highlighting the company’s proactive approach in an industry where consumer expectations are high and competition is intense. The official highlighted the changing nature of the sector, noting that 10 years ago, the Indian food delivery market was crowded with players like Foodpanda, TinyOwl, and even global major Amazon. Many of these companies have since exited, unable to maintain traction, reflecting the challenges within the sector. “Our focus remains on understanding consumer needs and rapidly adapting to trends, which we believe provides us an edge, irrespective of who enters the market,” Kapoor stated. Quick Commerce remains a major growth potential with the industry growing at 60-80 per cent. Swiggy has hit the Rs 11,327 crore IPO comprising fresh issue of shares worth Rs 4,499 crore, along with an offer for sale (OFS) of Rs 6,828 crore.

The company plans to utilise proceeds from the fresh issue for investing in technology and cloud infrastructure; brand marketing and business promotion; debt payment; and funds will also be allocated for inorganic growth and general corporate purposes.

For many, this IPO was seen as a test of whether the market still has an appetite for large first-time share sales after Hyundai Motor India Ltd.’s record $3.3 billion offer had a less-than-stellar debut. Swiggy’s offering also came at a time when global funds have been persistent sellers of local shares amid concerns about pricey valuations and slower earnings growth in India. Prosus NV-backed Swiggy’s offering includes a fresh issue of up to about 45 billion rupees ($535 million) and a sale of as many as 175.1 million shares by shareholders including venture-capital firm Accel and Tencent Cloud Europe BV. The company expects to list the shares by Nov. 13. Swiggy allocated 130.4 million shares worth 50.9 billion rupees ($605 million) to anchor investors at 390 rupees apiece, the top of the IPO’s price band, according to an exchange filing Tuesday. Anchor investors included global funds like Fidelity International and Invesco. In addition to contending with weak market sentiment, Swiggy’s losses may also have been be a sticking point for retail investors. The company posted a loss of 6.1 billion rupees ($73 million) for the three months ended June. Rival Zomato, which went public in 2021, reported a profit for the same period.

In an interview to PTI, CEO Food of Swiggy, Rohit Kapoor, acknowledged the possibility of the entry of Jio into the hyperlocal delivery market as a competitor, but underscored that building a successful business in this sector requires more than just capital. Speaking on the competitive dynamics, Kapoor said that while funding is important, it is not the sole determinant of long-term success, referencing examples of well-capitalised players in India who failed to establish a lasting presence. “Just having a lot of capital has not resulted in great businesses in India,” the official said, adding that success hinges on several other elements,” he said. “You need a strong ability to hire top technical talent, and that’s something traditional companies often struggle with. Beyond talent, a deep understanding of the Indian consumer – something we’ve developed over a decade of experience in kitchens across the country – is essential,” Kapoor said. Reflecting on Swiggy’s experience in the evolving food delivery landscape, the company noted that agility and rapid decision-making are crucial to staying competitive. “Our orientation towards speed allows us to launch a new category quickly, while others might take months to finalize their plans,” the official explained, highlighting the company’s proactive approach in an industry where consumer expectations are high and competition is intense. The official highlighted the changing nature of the sector, noting that 10 years ago, the Indian food delivery market was crowded with players like Foodpanda, TinyOwl, and even global major Amazon. Many of these companies have since exited, unable to maintain traction, reflecting the challenges within the sector. “Our focus remains on understanding consumer needs and rapidly adapting to trends, which we believe provides us an edge, irrespective of who enters the market,” Kapoor stated. Quick Commerce remains a major growth potential with the industry growing at 60-80 per cent. Swiggy has hit the Rs 11,327 crore IPO comprising fresh issue of shares worth Rs 4,499 crore, along with an offer for sale (OFS) of Rs 6,828 crore.

Indian food-delivery platform Swiggy Ltd.’s $1.3 billion initial public offering was fully sold on the final day of bidding, though at a slower pace due to weak early demand from large investors. The listing, one of the few $1 billion-plus listings in India, drew bids for 1.3 times the shares set aside for foreigners and domestic money managers. The retail tranche was almost fully covered. For many, this IPO was seen as a test of whether the market still has an appetite for large first-time share sales after Hyundai Motor India Ltd.’s record $3.3 billion offer had a less-than-stellar debut. Swiggy’s offering also came at a time when global funds have been persistent sellers of local shares amid concerns about pricey valuations and slower earnings growth in India. Prosus NV-backed Swiggy’s offering includes a fresh issue of up to about 45 billion rupees ($535 million) and a sale of as many as 175.1 million shares by shareholders including venture-capital firm Accel and Tencent Cloud Europe BV. The company expects to list the shares by Nov. 13. Swiggy allocated 130.4 million shares worth 50.9 billion rupees ($605 million) to anchor investors at 390 rupees apiece, the top of the IPO’s price band, according to an exchange filing Tuesday. Anchor investors included global funds like Fidelity International and Invesco. In addition to contending with weak market sentiment, Swiggy’s losses may also have been be a sticking point for retail investors. The company posted a loss of 6.1 billion rupees ($73 million) for the three months ended June. Rival Zomato, which went public in 2021, reported a profit for the same period.

In an interview to PTI, CEO Food of Swiggy, Rohit Kapoor, acknowledged the possibility of the entry of Jio into the hyperlocal delivery market as a competitor, but underscored that building a successful business in this sector requires more than just capital. Speaking on the competitive dynamics, Kapoor said that while funding is important, it is not the sole determinant of long-term success, referencing examples of well-capitalised players in India who failed to establish a lasting presence. “Just having a lot of capital has not resulted in great businesses in India,” the official said, adding that success hinges on several other elements,” he said. “You need a strong ability to hire top technical talent, and that’s something traditional companies often struggle with. Beyond talent, a deep understanding of the Indian consumer – something we’ve developed over a decade of experience in kitchens across the country – is essential,” Kapoor said. Reflecting on Swiggy’s experience in the evolving food delivery landscape, the company noted that agility and rapid decision-making are crucial to staying competitive. “Our orientation towards speed allows us to launch a new category quickly, while others might take months to finalize their plans,” the official explained, highlighting the company’s proactive approach in an industry where consumer expectations are high and competition is intense. The official highlighted the changing nature of the sector, noting that 10 years ago, the Indian food delivery market was crowded with players like Foodpanda, TinyOwl, and even global major Amazon. Many of these companies have since exited, unable to maintain traction, reflecting the challenges within the sector. “Our focus remains on understanding consumer needs and rapidly adapting to trends, which we believe provides us an edge, irrespective of who enters the market,” Kapoor stated. Quick Commerce remains a major growth potential with the industry growing at 60-80 per cent. Swiggy has hit the Rs 11,327 crore IPO comprising fresh issue of shares worth Rs 4,499 crore, along with an offer for sale (OFS) of Rs 6,828 crore.

Zomato entered into “exclusivity contracts” with partners in return for lower commissions, while Swiggy guaranteed business growth to certain players if they listed exclusively on its platform, according to non-public documents prepared by the Competition Commission of India (CCI).

Indian food-delivery platform Swiggy Ltd.’s $1.3 billion initial public offering was fully sold on the final day of bidding, though at a slower pace due to weak early demand from large investors. The listing, one of the few $1 billion-plus listings in India, drew bids for 1.3 times the shares set aside for foreigners and domestic money managers. The retail tranche was almost fully covered. For many, this IPO was seen as a test of whether the market still has an appetite for large first-time share sales after Hyundai Motor India Ltd.’s record $3.3 billion offer had a less-than-stellar debut. Swiggy’s offering also came at a time when global funds have been persistent sellers of local shares amid concerns about pricey valuations and slower earnings growth in India. Prosus NV-backed Swiggy’s offering includes a fresh issue of up to about 45 billion rupees ($535 million) and a sale of as many as 175.1 million shares by shareholders including venture-capital firm Accel and Tencent Cloud Europe BV. The company expects to list the shares by Nov. 13. Swiggy allocated 130.4 million shares worth 50.9 billion rupees ($605 million) to anchor investors at 390 rupees apiece, the top of the IPO’s price band, according to an exchange filing Tuesday. Anchor investors included global funds like Fidelity International and Invesco. In addition to contending with weak market sentiment, Swiggy’s losses may also have been be a sticking point for retail investors. The company posted a loss of 6.1 billion rupees ($73 million) for the three months ended June. Rival Zomato, which went public in 2021, reported a profit for the same period.

Speaking on the competitive dynamics, Kapoor said that while funding is important, it is not the sole determinant of long-term success, referencing examples of well-capitalised players in India who failed to establish a lasting presence. “Just having a lot of capital has not resulted in great businesses in India,” the official said, adding that success hinges on several other elements,” he said. “You need a strong ability to hire top technical talent, and that’s something traditional companies often struggle with. Beyond talent, a deep understanding of the Indian consumer – something we’ve developed over a decade of experience in kitchens across the country – is essential,” Kapoor said. Reflecting on Swiggy’s experience in the evolving food delivery landscape, the company noted that agility and rapid decision-making are crucial to staying competitive. “Our orientation towards speed allows us to launch a new category quickly, while others might take months to finalize their plans,” the official explained, highlighting the company’s proactive approach in an industry where consumer expectations are high and competition is intense. The official highlighted the changing nature of the sector, noting that 10 years ago, the Indian food delivery market was crowded with players like Foodpanda, TinyOwl, and even global major Amazon. Many of these companies have since exited, unable to maintain traction, reflecting the challenges within the sector. “Our focus remains on understanding consumer needs and rapidly adapting to trends, which we believe provides us an edge, irrespective of who enters the market,” Kapoor stated. Quick Commerce remains a major growth potential with the industry growing at 60-80 per cent. Swiggy has hit the Rs 11,327 crore IPO comprising fresh issue of shares worth Rs 4,499 crore, along with an offer for sale (OFS) of Rs 6,828 crore. The shares will be available for subscription in the price range of Rs 371 to Rs 390 apiece. The company plans to utilise proceeds from the fresh issue for investing in technology and cloud infrastructure; brand marketing and business promotion; debt payment; and funds will also be allocated for inorganic growth and general corporate purposes.

This funding move marks a significant step as Swiggy prepares for a $1.35 billion initial public offering (IPO), expected to be India’s second-largest IPO this year.

Zomato entered into “exclusivity contracts” with partners in return for lower commissions, while Swiggy guaranteed business growth to certain players if they listed exclusively on its platform, according to non-public documents prepared by the Competition Commission of India (CCI). Exclusivity arrangements between Swiggy, Zomato and their respective restaurant partners “prevent the market from becoming more competitive,” the CCI’s investigation arm noted in its findings reviewed by Reuters on Friday.

Indian food-delivery platform Swiggy Ltd.’s $1.3 billion initial public offering was fully sold on the final day of bidding, though at a slower pace due to weak early demand from large investors. The listing, one of the few $1 billion-plus listings in India, drew bids for 1.3 times the shares set aside for foreigners and domestic money managers. The retail tranche was almost fully covered. For many, this IPO was seen as a test of whether the market still has an appetite for large first-time share sales after Hyundai Motor India Ltd.’s record $3.3 billion offer had a less-than-stellar debut. Swiggy’s offering also came at a time when global funds have been persistent sellers of local shares amid concerns about pricey valuations and slower earnings growth in India. Prosus NV-backed Swiggy’s offering includes a fresh issue of up to about 45 billion rupees ($535 million) and a sale of as many as 175.1 million shares by shareholders including venture-capital firm Accel and Tencent Cloud Europe BV. The company expects to list the shares by Nov. 13. Swiggy allocated 130.4 million shares worth 50.9 billion rupees ($605 million) to anchor investors at 390 rupees apiece, the top of the IPO’s price band, according to an exchange filing Tuesday. Anchor investors included global funds like Fidelity International and Invesco. In addition to contending with weak market sentiment, Swiggy’s losses may also have been be a sticking point for retail investors. The company posted a loss of 6.1 billion rupees ($73 million) for the three months ended June. Rival Zomato, which went public in 2021, reported a profit for the same period.
