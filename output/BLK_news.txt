It would offer in-kind Ethereum subscriptions and redemptions—a feature absent in U.S. crypto ETFs. Monochrome Asset Management is set to debut Australia’s first spot Ethereum [ETH] exchange-traded fund (ETF) on Cboe Australia, marking a major step in the nation’s cryptocurrency investment landscape. Building on the success of its Bitcoin [BTC] ETF (IBTC) launched in August 2023—which has already attracted $15 million in assets—Monochrome’s new Ether ETF (IETH) aims to provide Australian investors with direct exposure to ETH. For those unaware, on 5th September, the asset manager filed an application hoping to secure approval by month’s end. Fortunately, after a swift approval process unlike the recent regulatory movements in the U.S., the IETH trading is set to commence on 14th October. Though modest compared to U.S. funds with billions in holdings, the Australian fund distinguishes itself globally by offering in-kind Ethereum subscriptions and redemptions. Providing further insights on the same, Jeff Yew, CEO of Monochrome Asset Management, highlighted a unique tax efficiency feature of the IETH in an exclusive interview with a publication. He explained that the fund’s dual-access bare trust structure is designed to avoid capital gains tax events, offering a strategic advantage for long-term Ethereum holders. This structure enables investors to transfer their Ethereum into the ETF without a shift in legal and beneficial ownership, potentially enhancing the tax advantages of in-kind subscriptions and redemptions. Yew added, “A ‘bare trust’ means that your investment in the ETF may be treated as if you directly own the Ethereum.” In fact, when IBTC gained momentum with its ETF in-kind subscription model, Yew said, “We are starting to see an interesting pattern with our Bitcoin ETF; people are moving their custody points from crypto exchanges into the ETF; that’s actually where we are seeing the biggest growth from.” That being said, recent U.S. ETF data reveals contrasting trends: as of 11th October, Bitcoin ETFs saw significant inflows, with $253.6 million added, while Ethereum ETFs recorded minor outflows of $0.1 million. Despite these contrasting trends, industry giants such as BlackRock and Fidelity maintain optimism for Ethereum’s potential. Although the Australian market is unlikely to replicate such high inflows, Monochrome aims to tap into the growing local interest in crypto investments, hoping to expand its presence as investor enthusiasm continues to build this year. “US crypto ETFs can’t be supported in kind, including Bitcoin ETFs, and they are not operated in this timezone.” In conclusion, the Monochrome Ethereum ETF (IETH) would offer Australian investors broad accessibility through major brokerage platforms, supporting crypto exchange and wallet transfers. With fees set at 0.5%, reduced to 0.21% for accredited advisers, it aligns closely with U.S. market rates, i.e. 0.20%- 0.25%. Hence, positioned for growth, IETH is well-prepared to capture any resurgence in market demand.

Title: Asia’s IPO bankers look beyond China slump with $6 billion week
URL: https://fortune.com/asia/2024/10/14/india-japan-ipo-hyundai-tokyo-metro-china-new-listings-this-week/
Time Published: 2024-10-14T10:30:45Z

Bankers are working on more than $6 billion of initial public offerings in Japan and India this week, getting a boost from two markets that have become an increasingly important revenue source amid a prolonged deal slump in China. Listings from [hotlink]Hyundai Motor[/hotlink] Co.’s India unit, subway operator Tokyo Metro Co. and Japanese X-ray technology company Rigaku Holdings Corp. will push IPO volumes in Asia Pacific excluding China past $28 billion, comfortably beating the $23.7 billion sold in 2023, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The deals underscore the increasing reliance on Japan and India among investment bankers who for years looked to China for bumper deal fees. Chinese listings have raised just over $20 billion this year, down from about $136 billion in 2021, after regulators increased their scrutiny of new deals and investors backed away amid concerns about the economy. The rise in Asia Pacific ex-China volumes has been fueled by more than $9 billion of supply from India, one of the biggest beneficiaries of investors’ doubts about China over the past year. “The stars are aligned in many respects,” Rahul Saraf, India head of investment banking at Citigroup Inc., said of the nation’s IPO market. Many Indian businesses have matured enough to list, and a stable political environment has provided a good backdrop for deals, he added. Hyundai Motor Co.’s India unit is taking orders this week for a $3.3 billion share sale, on track to be the country’s largest ever IPO. The deal has already seen solid demand, with BlackRock Inc., Singaporean sovereign wealth fund GIC Pte and Capital Group among those to bid for the company’s shares, Bloomberg News reported last week. India’s busy market for share sales is leading to some concerns about a bubble. Regulators have cracked down on irregularities such as financial statement fraud and price manipulation, eager to bolster the credibility of India’s capital markets ahead of major IPOs in the pipeline. The country’s IPO mania will eventually fizzle, but that doesn’t mean the market will abruptly turn south, said Nitin Mathur, an associate investment director at Fidelity International. “There could be a period of volatility because valuations in some areas of the market are expensive,” he said. But that wouldn’t be a bad thing for the long-term health of the market, he added. There have been recent signs of life for bankers working on listings for Chinese companies, with appliance maker Midea Group Co.’s recent $4.6 billion share sale in Hong Kong providing an optimistic backdrop for other deals. In Japan this week, subway operator Tokyo Metro Co. is expected to price an up to $2.3 billion listing, the country’s largest in six years, while X-ray technology company Rigaku Holdings Corp. is slated to raise more than $730 million from its own Tokyo listing. Long-only investors have covered the entire international tranche of Tokyo Metro’s IPO, Bloomberg News reported last week. Rigaku’s share sale was also said to have seen international order books being covered within a day of the deal’s launch. “Large-scale IPOs like that of Tokyo Metro attract significant attention from overseas investors,” said Chizuru Morishita, a researcher at NLI Research Institute. “If successful, it could make it easier for other companies to enter the market.” A rally in Japanese shares and a push for companies to boost shareholder returns and cut cross-shareholdings with other firms have provided a rosy backdrop for share sales in the country. Hyundai Motor India is expected to list its shares on Oct. 22. Tokyo Metro is set to debut on Oct. 23, and Rigaku on Oct. 25. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Title: Morning Bid: China doubts as economy struggles, US bonds closed
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/morning-bid-china-doubts-economy-101001372.html
Time Published: 2024-10-14T10:10:01Z

A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike Dolan With U.S. Treasury markets closed on Monday, Wall Street stocks are set to cruise on higher into the unfolding corporate earnings season - but may first have to take early direction from China's weekend stimulus update. The Colombus Day holiday closes Federal offices and the bond market but the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq remain open and stock futures are higher first thing, building on the S&P500's latest charge to new record highs. Financials led the way on Friday as the early burst of big bank and asset manager earnings was cheered - with 3-6% share price gains on Friday for the likes of JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and BlackRock. On Monday, however, China's markets struggled for direction as Saturday's much-heralded press conference on fiscal measures to accompany the recent frantic monetary easing turned out to be a bit of a damp squib. A little short on the sort of details investors had been betting on, Finance Minister Lan Foan reiterated Beijing's broad plans to revive the ailing economy, with promises made on increases to government debt and support for consumers and the property sector. Chinese mainland stocks gyrated initially and eventually ended more than 1% higher. But Hong Kong's Hang Seng ended 0.75% in the red. The offshore yuan weakened slightly against a red-hot dollar. Depending on who you talk to, you'll get a different readout on Beijing's rescue plans. But what's not in doubt is that they are badly needed. The latest economic news from China shows the country still flirting with outright price deflation through September, as headline annual consumer prices fell below forecast to just 0.4% and annual factory gate price inflation continued to slump a whopping 2.8% rate during the month. What's more, China's exports missed too - growing at the slowest pace in five months in September and suggesting manufacturers are no longer rushing out orders ahead of tariffs from trade partners. But at a paltry 0.3%, annual imports growth slowed too and were a third of expectations. While some banks such as Goldman Sachs have nudged up next year's real GDP forecasts due to the stimulus measures, the price picture raises questions about nominal growth and still suggests the government's 5% growth targets will be hard to hit. And the geopolitics doesn't help much. China's military launched a new round of war games near Taiwan on Monday, saying it was a warning to the "separatist acts of Taiwan independence forces" - drawing condemnation from the Taipei and U.S. governments. Taiwan's giant chipmaker TSMC, the main producer of advanced chips used in artificial intelligence applications, reports earnings on Thursday and is expected to show a 40% leap in third-quarter profit thanks to soaring AI-related demand. Oil prices weakened on the latest sweep of Chinese data and policy details, with some of the weekend premium on Middle East concerns dissipating on Monday too. Speculation over how Israel will respond to recent Iranian rocket attacks continues to simmer, however, with attention on Monday focussing on a U.S. decision to send both U.S. troops and anti-missile systems to Israel Even though last week's U.S. inflation numbers ran a bit hotter than forecast, the energy price picture remains relatively contained and annual U.S. crude prices have now been falling at a 10%-plus pace for more than six weeks. In Europe, markets are shaping up this week for the third European Central Bank interest rate cut of the year on Thursday. European stock were flat - warily eyeing both the muddy Chinese picture as trade tensions between Brussels and Beijing jar, but also likely further credit easing at home. LVMH, Hermes, Kering and other French luxury stocks exposed to China fell between 1.4% and 3.6% on Monday. The euro ebbed slightly into the ECB decision, with another quarter point cut in the official deposit rate to 3.25% now more or less fully priced. French debt markets and risk spreads shrugged off Friday's decision by Fitch credit ratings firm to lower the outlook on France's sovereign rating following the country's latest deficit-cutting budget plan last week. In Britain, Prime Minister Keir Starmer will vow to scrap regulation that holds back growth and investment when he hosts some of the world's biggest businesses on Monday at a conference designed to boost Britain's appeal. Back stateside, a relatively quiet Monday is likely as a result of the semi holiday. The earnings season resumes in earnest on Tuesday with updates from Goldman, Bank of America, Citigroup, State Street, Johnson & Johnson and others. Politics also gets more intense as the November 5 election nears. Although national opinion polls and those in swing states still show little between Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump, betting markets are making Trump slight favorite again for the first time since July. Key developments that should provide more direction to U.S. markets later on Monday: * Federal Reserve Board Governor Christopher Waller and Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari speak (By Mike Dolan, editing by Gareth Jones; mike.dolan@thomsonreuters.com) Sign in to access your portfolio

Shares in mainland China rose as investors digested Beijing’s Saturday briefing on stimulus measures, in which the finance minister said more was needed but didn’t offer specifics. Japan’s markets were closed for a public holiday. China: Shares rise after stimulus briefing Shanghai’s SSE Composite rose 2.07% after Finance Minister Lan Fo’an said in a Saturday briefing that there was “ample room” in the budget for more spending and that other policy tools were “being discussed.” But he offered no specifics on which stimulus measures or how large they would be. China also reported trade numbers, with exports in dollar terms growing 2.4% annually in September and imports expanding 0.3%—both below expectations. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng slid 0.75%. Europe: Shares hover as traders weigh China stimulus and expected rate cut European stocks floundered around breakeven early Monday as traders digested the China stimulus briefing and its lack of details. Luxury stocks with major exposure to China slipped, with LVMH, Hermès, and Kering all dropping more than 2% in the morning. The euro slipped marginally against the dollar, with the European Central Bank expected to cut interest rates at its Thursday meeting. The Stoxx Europe 600 was up 0.04% and the FTSE 100 was down 0.05% in morning trading. U.S. premarket mixed after hitting record territory After Wall Street rode into new record territory Friday on the back of strong earnings from financial giants JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, and BlackRock, the main U.S. indexes were mixed in premarket trading Monday as investors digested the China briefing—and prepared for more big bank earnings. After being punished Friday for its underwhelming robo-taxi reveal, Tesla rebounded 1.7% before the opening bell, while Boeing took a 1.5% drop on the back of its Friday announcement of 10% layoffs. And earnings season continues… Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, and Citigroup all show their numbers Tuesday; Morgan Stanley reports Wednesday; Netflix has its turn Thursday; and Friday features P&G and American Express. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Futures muted, earnings this week, Boeing job cuts - what's moving markets
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/futures-muted-earnings-this-week-boeing-job-cuts--whats-moving-markets-3661019

Investing.com -- US stock futures were muted on Monday after the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average notched fresh record closes in the prior session thanks in large part to higher-than-expected earnings from two big Wall Street banks. More results are due out this week, including figures from streaming video titan Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX). Elsewhere, Boeing (NYSE:BA) is reportedly preparing to deliver more details about planned job cuts as the jetmaker grapples with a financially-damaging work stoppage. 1. Futures muted US stock futures hovered around the flatline on Monday, with investors gauging upcoming corporate earnings and economic data this week. By 03:26 ET (07:26 GMT), the Dow futures contract and S&P 500 futures were mostly unchanged, and Nasdaq 100 futures had fallen by 11 points or 0.1%. On Friday, the benchmark S&P 500 and 30-stock Dow Jones Industrial Average logged record closes, buoyed by better-than-anticipated results from Wall Street banking giants JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and Wells Fargo. Asset manager Blackrock (NYSE:BLK) also unveiled an all-time peak in assets under management. Along with outpacing expectations, analysts at Vital Knowledge said the returns helped bolster confidence that the US economy is on track for a so-called "soft landing," in which a period of elevated interest rates successfully quells inflation without igniting a sharp downturn in the labor market or broader economy. 2. Earnings season kicks into gear More big banks are due to report in the coming week, including Bank of America and Citigroup on Tuesday, while Netflix is due to report after the close on Thursday. Investors will be closely watching results from Netflix -- specifically whether the streaming service is adding or losing customers and at what pace -- for insights into the state of consumer spending. Companies will need to top expectations for profit growth in their quarterly reports to support the stock market's valuation, which stands well above its historical average. Third quarter earnings results should confirm that large-cap corporate profit growth remains solid, analysts at UBS said in a note on Friday. "Now that the Fed has started its rate-cutting cycle, the economy should get a further boost from lower interest rates on things like credit card debt and business loans." 3. Boeing job cut details expected - reports Managers at Boeing are due to find out more details on Monday about the aerospace giant's plan to slash around 17,000 positions, media reports have said. The cuts, which will amount to 10% of Boeing's global headcount, will reportedly have an impact on roles around the business and include executives, managers and staff. The firm will also delay the first deliveries of its 777X plane by a year and book $5 billion in losses in the third quarter, according to the reports. Boeing Chief Executive Kelly Ortberg told employees on Friday that "tough decisions," such as structural changes, will be needed to bolster the performance of the wider group and ensure its long-term competitiveness. Ortberg has been attempting to navigate Boeing through a prolonged strike by workers in the US Pacific Northwest that is leading to heavy expenses and placing its bond rating in jeopardy of slipping into junk territory. Analysts have said that the company will need to raise at least $10 billion in fresh financing to shore up its finances. 4. Chinese stocks rise despite middling stimulus cues, weak inflation data Chinese stocks brushed off initial volatility and clocked gains on Monday, rising even as the government provided middling cues on fiscal stimulus and inflation data underwhelmed. China’s Shanghai Shenzhen CSI 300 and Shanghai Composite indexes closed higher by 1.9% and 2.1% respectively. The two were choppy in morning trading. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index, which has more exposure to foreign investors, fell 0.1%, trimming a bulk of its initial losses after falling more than 2% earlier. China’s finance ministry said in a weekend briefing that it will implement fiscal stimulus measures, including more debt issuance and support for provincial governments. But the government did not provide key details on the timing and scale of the plans. Calls for more aid from Beijing were further boosted by weaker-than-expected Chinese consumer and factory price inflation in September. 5. Oil slips amid China woes Oil prices fell sharply Monday, retreating after the Chinese inflation data and fiscal stimulus plans raised doubts about the health of the country's economy. By 03:27 ET, the Brent contract dropped 1.6% to $77.78 per barrel, while U.S. crude futures (WTI) traded 1.7% lower at $74.30 a barrel. Figures released over the weekend showed consumer price growth in China unexpectedly eased in September, while producer prices marked nearly two years of contraction -- data which bodes poorly for demand in the world’s biggest oil importer. A monthly report from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is due later in the day and is likely to provide more cues on supply, while the Middle East conflict remains in focus.

Title: Keir Starmer pledges to scrap red tape to boost UK investment

The chancellor has given the clearest signal yet that businesses will face an increase in National Insurance on the day the government announced billions of pounds in overseas investment had been secured. Rachel Reeves said Labour's election pledge not to increase National Insurance on "working people" related to the employee element, as opposed to the sum paid by employers. Her comments come as businesses await the new government's economic plans in the Budget later this month. The government claimed its international investment summit on Monday secured Â£63bn of private funding for UK projects. However, many of the commitments had already been announced in advance. While the investment pledges signal a boost for the government, many business leaders are closely watching what taxes will be hiked on 30 October. Reeves reiterated her Budget would be "tough", but stressed difficult decisions would not put off business investment in the UK because she would offer firms long-term certainty about the levels of taxation they will face. The government has ruled out increasing VAT, National Insurance or income tax, speculation has grown around the rate of National Insurance paid by employers. Reeves repeated the pledge not to raise taxes on "working people" - echoing comments from Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds - but only pledged to cap corporation tax, the levy paid by businesses on profits, at 25% for the next five years. There is also speculation over a potential rise in Capital Gains Tax, which is charged on profits made from the sale of an asset that has increased in value, such as second homes. However, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer told Bloomberg reports suggesting a rise as high as 39% were "wide of the mark", although he did not elaborate further. The chancellor did hint that she might change the government's borrowing rules to free up billions of pounds more in spending for big projects. "We do want to free up investment in those long-term responsible investments that we need to make, to unlock the private investment into our economy," she said. Some of the new investment pledges from firms on Monday include: Â£1.1bn cash injection into Stansted Airport by its owner Manchester Airports Group to expand the airport's terminal by a third, creating more than 5,000 jobs Â£279m from US pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly to tackle "significant health challenges", such as obesity Â£20bn over the next five years from Australian firm Macquarie towards various infrastructure projects including an electric car charging network. Macquarie has been blamed for saddling Thames Water with unsustainable debts when it was its biggest shareholder Â£1bn confirmed by DP World to create 400 new jobs and make London Gateway the UK's largest container port within five years. The commitment had looked to be in jeopardy after Transport Secretary Louise Haigh called on people to "boycott" DP World's subsidiary P&O Ferries over their past treatment of staff - comments which were later rebuked by the prime minister Was Keir Starmer's investment summit a success? Billions pumped into Stansted and London Gateway port Port plan to go ahead after row over minister's comments Separately on Monday, Sir Keir defended the government's plans to overhaul and increase workers' rights as "pro-growth". He told the summit he would scrap regulation that "holds back investment" and would ask regulators to prioritise economic growth. The government's Employment Rights Bill includes proposals that would see people being able to get sick pay from the first day they are ill and claim unpaid parental leave as soon as they start a job. Most of the planned changes will not take effect for two years, but some business groups are concerned about how they would work in practice and impact hiring. But Sir Keir said greater security for workers would lead to better growth in the economy. Former Tory donor John Caudwell, the founder of Phones 4U who came out in favour of Labour ahead of the general election, told the BBC he was "not very keen" on Labour's plans to increase workers' rights, calling them "a real burden on business". But he said businesses and potential investors, would "swallow the difficulties that come as a result of that extra regulation on employee rights" if the wider goal of growing the economy was met. Aviva boss Amanda Blanc said speeding up planning rules is vital Sir Keir also said he wanted to "rip out" bureaucracy obstructing investment in the UK. Eric Schmidt, the former chief executive of internet giant Google, told Sir Keir at the event that delays to regulation were "killing you". "I think the business community would much rather have a single person who can say yes or no... and then they can move on," he said. The head of insurance giant Aviva, Amanda Blanc, said simplifying planning procedures was key. "We can commit to doing projects but if you canât get the planning permission you could be sitting with a project for two to three years where youâve got money ready to go," she said. The boss of Eli Lilly, David Ricks, who also attended the event, said the UK had to take a "different" approach to attract multinationals given it was no longer part of the EU. Earlier this month it emerged that the world's richest person, Elon Musk, had not been invited to the investment summit. But Technology Secretary Peter Kyle said the billionaire would have been "very, very welcome". "We would love to engage with Elon Musk," Kyle said. "If he opens up an investment programme and there is global competition for it, believe me we will be first in line."

October 14, 2024 01:30 ET | Source: NICOX SA NICOX SA Press Release Nicox and Soleus Sign $16.5 million Royalty and Equity Financing October 14, 2024 – release at 7:30 am CETSophia Antipolis, France Nicox SA (Euronext Growth Paris: FR0013018124, ALCOX), an international ophthalmology company, today announced that it has entered into a royalty purchase agreement with Soleus Capital Credit Opportunities Fund I, L.P. (and any affiliated entity, “Soleus”), an investment fund managed by Soleus Capital Management, L.P. (“Soleus Capital”), a US-based life sciences investment firm. Soleus will acquire Nicox’s VYZULTA royalty (net of payments to Pfizer), for $15 million (€13.7 million), together with a subscription of $1.5 million (€1.37 million) for Units comprised of one share with one attached warrant (the “Units”) at €0.3144 per Unit, representing 120% of Nicox's closing share price on 11 October 2024, on the terms set out below. The warrants (the “Warrants”) give the right to acquire a maximum of 1,308,077 Nicox shares at a price of €0.5240 per share, which is a 100% premium to the closing price of Nicox’s ordinary shares on October 11, 2024. Exercise of the warrants would result in additional gross proceeds of €0.69 million. The Company has also entered into agreement with its existing lenders to release the guarantee held over VYZULTA, including, amongst other obligations, the repayment of €5.2 million of outstanding debt by June 2025, as set out below. “VYZULTA was the first nitric oxide donating compound from Nicox’s research to be marketed. The agreements announced today allow us to effectively monetize our VYZULTA revenue stream, creating an immediate source of cash to finance the development of our lead asset, NCX 470, whilst also bringing in a new, specialist investor, investing at a premium, to accompany our future development.” said Gavin Spencer, Chief Executive Officer of Nicox. “In addition, we are able to announce that the accelerated recruitment of patients in the Denali Phase 3 clinical trial of NCX 470 has brought the expected date of topline data into Q3 2025. With our financing needs addressed until Q3 2025, we look forward to the completion of recruitment in the Denali trial, together with the launch of ZERVIATE in China, where it was recently approved, bringing a new revenue stream to the Company.” “We are excited to partner with Nicox on this transaction, providing the company runway towards its key value inflection point of clinical data for its Phase 3 Denali trial. In addition to providing non-dilutive capital in the form of the VYZULTA royalty monetization, we also look forward to accompanying Nicox as shareholders as they continue their work to bring NCX 470 to the market and develop their partnerships,” said Benjamin Lund, Partner at Soleus Capital. Soleus Capital is an investment firm based in Greenwich, CT focused on the innovative areas of life sciences, including biopharmaceuticals, medical technologies, life sciences tools and diagnostics. With approximately $2.2 billion in total assets under management as of October 1, 2024, Soleus Capital invests across the healthcare lifecycle from developmental-stage through commercial, and partners with life science companies across the capital structure. Nicox was advised by Bourne Partners with Lexelians and Farber LLC law firms serving as legal advisors. Soleus was advised by Morgan Lewis & Bockius LLP and Racine. Cash Runway Based on the cash and cash equivalents held by the Company, the net proceeds from the transactions announced today, after deduction of legal, banking and other fees, and expected milestone income from existing agreements, the Company estimates that it is financed into Q3 2025. If any of the assumptions around estimated income, recovery of taxes or costs change, this may impact the cash runway of the Company. The Company continues to evaluate all options for non-dilutive and dilutive financing to extend its cash runway. In particular, the Company is actively exploring multiple strategic options which could facilitate the development and commercialization of its drug candidate NCX 470 and the future growth of the Company. NCX 470 (bimatoprost grenod) Development update NCX 470 is a novel nitric oxide (NO)-donating bimatoprost eye drop, based on the same technology as VYZULTA, and is currently in a second pivotal Phase 3 trial, Denali, in the U.S. and China for the lowering of intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. The topline data from the Denali trial is now expected in Q3 2025 and the Company intends to commercialize NCX 470 in the U.S. through a partnership. NCX 470 is already partnered in China and Southeast Asia with Ocumension, who expects to be able to file a Chinese New Drug Application following completion of the Denali trial, and with Kowa in Japan, where additional clinical trials will be required. Upcoming milestones About VYZULTA VYZULTA, exclusively licensed worldwide to Bausch + Lomb, is a prostaglandin analog with one of its metabolites being NO. VYZULTA is indicated for the reduction of IOP in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension in the U.S. At approval, VYZULTA was the first eye drop approved in the past 20 years with a novel approach to reduce IOP. VYZULTA is commercialized in more than 15 countries, including the U.S. where it is covered by a composition of matter patent to 2029. VYZULTA was licensed exclusively to Bausch + Lomb globally in 2010 and was launched in the U.S. in 2017. Prior to the transaction with Soleus, Nicox received 6% net royalties on global sales, net of royalties payable to Pfizer, per the terms of the contract signed with Pfizer in August 2009, with a $5 million net milestone payable to Nicox at $100 million net sales. Nicox received net royalty revenue of over €4 million in 2023, the majority of which was from VYZULTA sales. Terms of the VYZULTA Royalty Sale to Soleus Under the terms of the agreement, Nicox will receive a payment from Soleus of $15 million (€13.7 million), less certain expenses. In exchange for this payment, Soleus will receive all royalties and milestone payments due to Nicox from VYZULTA sales since 1 July 2024 and in the future, net of payments to Pfizer, per the terms of the contract signed with Pfizer in August 2009. Payments to Pfizer and to Soleus will be made by Bausch + Lomb at the direction of Soleus and Nicox. The agreement includes other customary provisions for a transaction of this nature. The agreement with Soleus only covers VYZULTA revenue and does not include any other Nicox products nor product candidates. In addition to this payment of $15 million Nicox will receive a $1.5 million (€1.37 million) equity financing as detailed below. Terms of the Amendment to the existing Debt Agreement Nicox will make debt repayments of €5.2 million to its existing lender Kreos Capital VI (UK) Limited (together with its affiliates “Kreos”1) by June 2025 and the interest rate on the outstanding debt shall remain at 9.25%. Such repayments will reduce the amortizable portion of the debt, currently representing €11.8 million, out of a total debt with Kreos of €19.4 million. Nicox will also pay a 1% restructuring fee on capital outstanding to Kreos. Kreos will release the security held over VYZULTA and will take an additional security over NCX 470. The other elements of the debt, set out in the Company’s Annual Report 2023, remain unchanged, except as explained below. In addition, Kreos shall be entitled to: Terms of the Capital Increase by Soleus Capital stock before the Transaction Nicox's paid-in capital consists of 64,233,248 fully subscribed and paid-up shares with a par value of €0.01 each. Nature and legal basis of the Transaction Using the authorization granted under the eighth resolution of the Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting of May 6, 2024, the Company's Board of Directors, meeting on October 11, 2024, voted to make a share capital increase without pre-emptive rights through the issue of Units consisting of shares with attached warrants, in the manner described in this announcement. Number of shares to be issued The total number of Units, each including one share with a par value of €0.01, to be issued is 4,360,256, at a unit subscription price of €0.3144, giving gross proceeds of €1.37 million (representing €43,602.56 of par value plus €1,327,261.93 of new issue premium). Each Unit will carry one Warrant, which is immediately detachable. 10 Warrants will be worth 3 new shares if exercised before 10 October 2034, at the strike price of €0.5240. Exercise of all the warrants would represent additional gross proceeds of around €0.69 million. Subscription price The subscription price for a Unit is €0.3144 i.e. 120% of the closing Nicox share price on October 11, 2024 (€0.2620). Features of the new shares The new shares, which will be subject to all the provisions of the Articles of Association, will be issued with dividend rights. They will be treated in the same way as existing shares as soon as they are issued. Application will be made for the shares to be admitted to trading on Euronext Growth Paris. They will be listed on the same line as existing shares and will be fully equivalent to them as soon as they are admitted to trading. Clearing/settlement and listing of the new shares on Euronext Growth Paris is expected by October 17, 2024. Features of the Warrants The Warrants will be detached from the shares when the Units are issued. The exercise price of the warrants will be €0.5240, i.e 200% of the closing Nicox share price on October 11, 2024 (€0.262), and the warrants may be exercised between October 11, 2024 and October 10, 2034. The warrants will not be listed on Euronext Growth nor any other exchange. 10 Warrants gives the right to 3 shares at the exercise price, which would result in total additional gross proceeds of €0.69 million if all the warrants were exercised. Shareholder structure For your information, to the best knowledge of the Company, the equity and voting rights of the Company, before and after the issuance of 4,360,256 Units, are distributed as follows: Impact of the offering on shareholders' equity, per share By way of illustration, the impact of the issue on shareholders' equity per share (calculated on the basis of shareholders' equity at September 30, 2024 and the number of shares in the Company's equity at the same date) would look as follows: * Based on the 64,233,248 shares existing as of September 30, 2024 ** Taking into account the issue of 34,325,201 new shares issuable at the date of this press release on the exercise of stock options (1,655,501 shares), the vesting of restricted stock (1,498,741 shares), the exercise of warrants (17,970,959 shares) and the conversion of bonds convertible into equity (13,200,000 shares).

Wall Street rolled to more records as U.S. stocks added to their all-time highs NEW YORK -- Wall Street rolled to more records Monday as U.S. stocks added to their all-time highs. The S&P 500 climbed 0.8% to build on its record set on Friday. It’s coming off its fifth straight winning week and is on track for its longest weekly winning streak of the year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.5% and added 201 points to its own record, while the Nasdaq composite gained 0.9%. The gains followed relatively quiet trading in Europe, while the U.S. bond market remained closed for the day because of a holiday. The strongest action in global markets came from China, where the finance minister gave a highly anticipated update on Saturday about plans for the world’s second-largest economy. Lan Fo’an said the government is looking at additional ways to boost the economy, but he stopped short of unveiling a major new stimulus plan that investors were hoping for. The lack of detail sent markets spinning. Stocks in Shanghai jumped 2.1%, but the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong fell 0.7%. Crude oil prices, meanwhile, sank roughly 2% on worries about demand from China’s slowing economy. Hopes for big stimulus in China have sent Chinese stocks sharply higher recently after they languished for years. But investors are skeptical about how much it can remake and restore the economy. “While clearly welcome, the efforts may be insufficient to spur a new reflationary cycle,” according to Lisa Shalett, chief investment officer at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management. Besides oil, prices also fell for copper and other commodities that a healthy Chinese economy would devour. That helped drive down prices for miners, such as Freeport-McMoRan, which fell 2.3% for one of the larger losses in the S&P 500. Boeing lost 1.3% in its first trading since the aerospace giant warned that it expects to report that it burned through $1.3 billion in cash during the latest quarter and lost $9.97 per share. Boeing also said it was laying off 10% of its workforce as it tries to deal with a labor strike that is crippling production of the company’s best-selling airline planes. On the winning side of Wall Street was SoFi Technologies. It rose 11.4% after announcing a $2 billion loan platform agreement with investment firm Fortress Investment Group, where SoFi will refer pre-qualified borrowers. Longboard Pharmaceuticals soared 51.6% after H. Lundbeck, a Danish company, said it would buy the biopharmaceutical company in an all-cash deal valuing it at $2.6 billion. Trump Media & Technology Group jumped 18.5% and is near $30 again for the first time since July. The company behind former President Donald Trump’s Truth Social platform had briefly dropped below $12 last month. It continues to lose money, but its stock often moves more with Trump’s perceived re-election chances than anything else. All told, the S&P 500 rose 44.82 points to 5,859.85. The Dow added 201.36 to 43,065.22, and the Nasdaq composite gained 159.75 to 18,502.69. This upcoming week will have few top-tier economic reports outside of Thursday’s update on sales at U.S. retailers to help guide trading. That will likely leave the emphasis on corporate earnings reports, which will pick up the pace this week after big banks began the reporting season last week. Bank of America, Johnson & Johnson and UnitedHealth Group will all report their latest results on Tuesday. Later in the week will come United Airlines, Netflix, American Express and Procter & Gamble. Analysts are looking for S&P 500 companies to deliver overall growth of 4.1% in earnings per share for the latest quarter from a year earlier, according to FactSet. If they’re correct, it would be a fifth straight quarter of growth. Solid, continued growth in profits for companies would help tamp down criticism that’s built up about how expensive the broad stock market looks, after share prices ran higher faster than earnings. Stocks have broadly rallied to records on relief that interest rates are finally heading back down, now that the Federal Reserve has widened its focus to include keeping the economy humming instead of just fighting high inflation. Recent reports showing the U.S. economy remains stronger than expected have also raised optimism that the Fed can pull off a perfect landing where it gets inflation down to 2% without causing a recession that many had thought would be necessary. ___ AP Business Writer Elaine Kurtenbach contributed. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks are rising Monday to add to their all-time highs. The S&P 500 was up 0.8% in afternoon trading and building on its record set on Friday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average came back from an early loss to rise 212 points and add 0.5% to its own record, as of 2:25 p.m. Eastern time, while the Nasdaq composite was up 0.9%.

Stocks have broadly rallied to records on relief that interest rates are finally heading back down, now that the Federal Reserve has widened its focus to include keeping the economy humming instead of just fighting high inflation. Recent reports showing the U.S. economy remains stronger than expected have also raised optimism that the Fed can pull off a perfect landing where it gets inflation down to 2% without causing a recession that many had thought would be necessary. ___ AP Business Writer Elaine Kurtenbach contributed.

Investing.com -- US stocks traded higher on Monday as investors awaited more third-quarter earnings and potential comments from several Federal Reserve officials on monetary policy. At 11:04 ET (15:04 GMT), the 30-stock Dow Jones Industrial Average inched up by 62 points, or 0.2%, while the benchmark S&P 500 index rose 31 points or 0.5%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite climbed 116 points or 0.6%. The third-quarter earnings season is set to pick up in earnest this week, with more results from the country's banking giants as Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Citigroup (NYSE:C) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) are set to report on Tuesday, and Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) on Wednesday. Additionally, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), chipmaking bellwether ASML (AS:ASML) and streaming giant Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) are due to report during the week. Investors will be largely focused on whether corporate earnings were able to persevere despite pressure from high interest rates and sticky inflation. Elsewhere, Boeing (NYSE:BA) stock fell 2.6%, with managers at the aircraft manufacturer likely to find out later Monday more details about plans to slash around 17,000 positions, around 10% of its global headcount. It will also delay the first deliveries of its 777X plane by a year and book $5 billion in losses in the third quarter. B. Riley Financial (NASDAQ:RILY) stock soared 22% after the Wall Street Journal reported the Investment bank has agreed to sell its appraisal and valuations unit, Great American, to asset-management firm Oaktree Capital for about $400 million. This week also sees addresses from a number of Fed officials, which are likely to provide more cues on the central bank’s plans to cut interest rates further. Governor Christopher Waller, Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari are expected to speak later on Monday, and there is strong interest in what they might say about the central bank's rate outlook. Markets will get another update on the health of the U.S. consumer on Thursday, in the form of the latest retail sales data. Investors will also study the latest news about additional stimulus in China, the second largest economy in the world. China’s finance ministry said in a weekend briefing that it will implement fiscal stimulus measures, including more debt issuance and support for provincial governments. But the government did not provide key details on the timing and scale of the plans. Oil prices fell sharply Monday, retreating after OPEC cut its demand growth forecasts, while Chinese inflation data raised doubts about the health of the country's economy. By 09:35 ET, the Brent contract dropped 1.6% to $77.77 per barrel, while US crude futures (WTI) traded 1.6% lower at $74.33 a barrel. Figures released over the weekend showed consumer price growth in China unexpectedly eased in September, while producer prices marked nearly two years of contraction -- data which bodes poorly for demand in the world’s biggest oil importer. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries cut its forecast for global oil demand growth in 2024, marking the producer group's third consecutive downward revision. OPEC, in a monthly report released earlier Monday, said world oil demand will rise by 1.93 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2024, down from growth of 2.03 million bpd it expected last month. For next year, OPEC cut its 2025 global demand growth estimate to 1.64 million bpd from 1.74 million bpd. China accounted for the bulk of the 2024 downgrade, as OPEC trimmed its Chinese growth forecast to 580,000 bpd from 650,000 bpd. (Ambar Warrick and Peter Nurse contributed to this article.)

Billions worth of investments in emerging growth sectors including AI and life sciences, and infrastructure are set to be unveiled by businesses and ministers at the government’s inaugural International Investment Summit today (Monday 14th October). World leading CEO’s and investors from across the globe will meet with ministers, First Ministers, and local leaders at the Guildhall – a historic landmark which has served as the ceremonial heart of the City of London for centuries. Securing investment is central to the government’s mission to deliver economic growth which will create jobs, improve living standards, and make communities and families across the country better off. The government has already secured tens of billions worth of investments within 100 days of being in office. The International Investment Summit will provide an opportunity to build on this progress and showcase the UK’s economic strengths. The event will demonstrate that through serious, stable governance, the UK can establish enduring partnerships with businesses to boost investment and give investors the confidence they need to choose Britain. In a sign of intent to deliver on its central promise, this government has immediately made a series of major interventions to restore economic stability and create the right conditions for growth and investment. Business leaders this week hailed the UK’s “clear policy direction” as they announced over £24 billion worth of investment in clean energy projects. The government’s policy platform – including bolstering the Office for Investment, a robust Industrial Strategy, major planning reforms to unlock infrastructure and housing, and founding a National Wealth Fund to catalyse private money – will attract investment, kickstart growth, and unlock Britain’s potential. In his keynote speech opening the summit, the Prime Minister will outline how the government will build on this work, with a vow to “do everything in my power to galvanise growth including getting rid of regulation that needlessly holds back investment.” He is expected to say not enough has been done to make sure the UK is keeping pace with emerging industries. He will pledge to “upgrade the regulatory regime to make it fit for the modern age, making Britain fit to harness all opportunities.” In his keynote speech, the Prime Minister will make his ‘pitch for Britain’. On the value of stability, the Prime Minister is expected to say: “It’s not just that stability leads to growth – though we all recognise that. It’s also that growth leads to stability. Growth leads to a country that is better equipped to come together and get its future back. That’s why it’s always been so critical to my project. “We have a golden opportunity to use our mandate, to end chop and change, policy churn and sticking plasters that make it so hard for investors to assess the value of any proposition. “We have the determination, the focus on clear long-term ends, a mission-led mindset that thinks in years, not the days or hours of the news grid, needed to unlock that potential. Do not doubt that. “We are focusing on investment because the mission of growth, in this country especially, demands it. Private sector investment is the way we rebuild our country and pay our way in the world. This is a great moment to back Britain. This is great moment to back England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales.” On regulation, he is expected to say: “We’ve got to look at regulation where it is needlessly holding back the investment, to take our country forward. “Where it is stopping us building the homes, the data centres, warehouses, grid connectors, roads, trainlines, you name it then mark my words – we will get rid of it. “We will rip out the bureaucracy that blocks investment and we will make sure that every regulator in this country take growth as seriously as this room does.” The government will ask the CMA to prioritise growth, investment, and innovation through their work as a priority and it will also be reviewing the focus of other major regulators. The regulatory review is just one part of the government’s work ensuring Britain is at the front of the queue for emerging opportunities. It builds on the recent creation of the Regulatory Innovation Office, which will curb red tape for cutting-edge emerging technologies, speed up approvals, and allow them to be rolled out to the public safely and quickly. These changes come at the same time as the government delivers on a key manifesto promise to establish a modern Industrial Strategy. Long called for by business, the strategy hardwires long-term stability for investors and plays to the UK’s strengths by focusing on eight growth-driving sectors. The summit will involve sessions with ministers and business leaders to discuss how together we can ensure the UK capitalises on emerging growth sectors including health tech and AI, clean energy and creative industries, for the good of working people. Confirmed speakers including Ruth Porat President & Chief Investment Officer of Alphabet, David A. Ricks Chair and CEO of Eli Lilly, Alex Kendall CEO of Wayve and Pushmeet Kohli Vice President of Research at Google DeepMind. The Prime Minister will take part in an “in conversation” event with former CEO and chairman of Google Eric Schmidt, moderated by CEO of GSK Dame Emma Walmsley to discuss how the UK can seize the opportunities of AI to drive growth and productivity, and it’s potential to improve public services such as health and education. The Chancellor will close the summit and take part in a panel event discussing investment opportunities in the UK with Group Chief Executive of USS Carol Young, Chairman and CEO of BlackRock Larry Fink and CEO of Brookfield Asset Management Bruce Flatt. Attendees will then be invited to an exclusive reception at St Paul’s Cathedral attended by His Majesty The King. Investment Minister Poppy Gustafsson OBE said: “It’s never been a better time to invest in Britain. This summit is a hugely significant moment to showcase the UK’s economic strengths on the world stage and I’m delighted to be part of the government’s important work to drive growth and investment across the UK.” Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan said: “I’m delighted to be attending the International Investment Summit. With a new government, we are reclaiming Britain’s reputation as a magnet for global investment - bringing with it new technology, new ways of thinking and, crucially, new jobs across our country, meaning higher living standards. “London and the UK are open for business, trade and investment. I will continue working with the Government to forge new partnerships, reset relationships and seize the opportunity to secure long-term investment so that we can build a better London for everyone and deliver the change Britain needs.” Alex Kendall, Co-Founder and CEO of Wayve, said: “I’m delighted to join the inaugural International Investment Summit. The UK has a strong opportunity to lead in Embodied AI, especially in automated vehicles. “We appreciate the Government’s proactive collaboration with industry on intelligent legislation like the AV Act 2024. Their sector-specific approach to AI regulation is the right way to encourage both investment and innovation. “As we advance our Embodied AI technology into safe, reliable, production-ready software for global automakers, we look forward to continuing to work with the Government to harmonise global regulations and scale UK innovation internationally.” Ruth Porat Chief Investment Officer at Alphabet Inc said: “Google is proud of our long history of meaningful investments in local talent, infrastructure and digital skilling in the UK which help everyone participate in the benefits of the digital economy. With the UK’s rich academic heritage, particularly in the sciences, it is well-positioned to capture the many opportunities that AI can deliver. “The Investment Summit is an important moment to reflect on the progress to date, and how to best position the UK as a global leader in AI, with the economic and societal benefits this transformative technology can deliver today, and in the years ahead.” The following links open in a new tab Don’t include personal or financial information like your National Insurance number or credit card details.

Title: Cardano Isn’t Failing: Hoskinson Credits Voltaire for Addressing Long-Standing Issues

Time Published: 2024-10-13T20:18:06Z

Cardano (ADA) introduced decentralized governance through the Chang hard fork upgrade that went live last month. While this upgrade made Cardano more decentralized, Charles Hoskinson believes it has also spurred negative sentiment around the project. In an X post, Hoskinson noted that allowing the Cardano community to contribute and voice their concerns about the project opened up “pent-up grievances” on a wide range of issues. “There have been years of pent-up grievances, unexplored road map items, unfunded growth strategies, and needed partnerships that haven’t been addressed due to Cardano’s governance not scaling to meet the needs of the ecosystem,” Hoskinson stated. The outspoken Cardano founder also noted that the Voltaire upgrade would introduce a new roadmap for the project. This roadmap will ensure that issues not previously addressed will be brought into focus to improve the network’s scalability. One of these issues is the Cardano sidechain solution known as Midnight. This solution will help boost the project’s liquidity. Furthermore, the blockchain is also boosting stablecoin support to boost usage. Hoskinson also stated that Cardano differed from the rest of the cryptocurrency industry by being more transparent. He mentioned that, unlike other projects, Cardano did not deal in “backroom deals and dirty tricks.” “It’s why we are loathed by a lot of others… Short-term thinking, market manipulation, and companies seeking a handout have no role or place here,” he stated. Hoskinson also bashed projects fighting for recognition on Wall Street through exchange-traded funds (ETFs). He stated that ADA was one of the few cryptocurrencies that still wanted to be “real and not the patron of BlackRock and Wall Street.” Hoskinson’s statement has drawn reactions from the broader cryptocurrency community. X user @cardano_whale stated that the negative sentiment around ADA revolved around price action and engagement farming. However, not all community members believe that Cardano is doing well in terms of governance. One user noted that Cardano developers were supposed to improve scalability before introducing the Voltaire upgrade. Wasn’t IOG supposed to finishing scaling BEFORE Voltaire? So that part of the roadmap was supposed to be YOUR responsibility.Or am I wrong? Another user also stated that Cardano was suffering from a lack of volumes and declining usage, which pointed towards the failure of the founding entities. Furthermore, the few governance wallets limited the project’s level of decentralization. Cardano traded at $0.3468 at press time after an around 1.49% drop in 24 hours.

As the earnings season unfolds, investors are eager to see how artificial intelligence (AI) investments among S&P 500 companies are yielding results. Analysts anticipate profit growth to decelerate, with S&P 500 earnings projected to rise by 5.3% compared to the same quarter last year, down from a 13.2% increase in the second quarter, per a report by news agency Reuters. The technology and communication services sectors are expected to show the strongest year-over-year growth, with technology earnings forecasted to increase by 15.4% and communication services by 12.3%. AI-related firms have dominated earnings narratives since last year, driving substantial market gains. The S&P 500 is currently at record highs, having risen approximately 21% year-to-date, largely fueled by robust performance in the tech and communication sectors.

Howard Chan, CEO of Kurv Investment Management, noted that analysts are keen to evaluate how major companies monetize their AI initiatives, with those succeeding in this regard being notably rewarded. Meta, for instance, experienced a surge in share prices after projecting strong sales growth, suggesting that its digital ad revenue is effectively funding its AI investments. Conversely, the expenditures of giants like Google on AI technologies have raised questions regarding their integration with existing business models. With the S&P 500 trading at 22.3 times future 12-month earnings estimates, surpassing its long-term average of 15.7, many investors hope that this quarter's earnings will justify higher stock valuations. Solita Marcelli from UBS Global Wealth Management expressed optimism that upcoming third-quarter results could catalyze further gains, particularly as the semiconductor sector remains a focal point for AI investment.

Goldman Sachs recently lowered the price target on the stock to $500 from $515 and kept a Buy rating on the shares. The investment firm slightly lowered free cash flow expectations after Microsoft's fiscal 2026 and 2027 artificial intelligence capex estimates. However, as Azure capacity comes online and AI revenue continues to scale, Microsoft should execute well against Goldman's expectations for 14% revenue growth, the advisory told investors in a research note. The investment firm said Microsoft’s earnings growth is still 300 basis points faster than the S&P 500, which justifies the stock's valuation. Overall MSFT ranks 2nd on our list of the trending AI stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MSFT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Piper Sandler recently maintained a Neutral rating on the shares with a price target of $225. In an investor note, the advisory said it surveyed about 13,500 teens as a part of the firm's Taking Stock with Teens Fall 2024 survey, and based on the responses, it continued to believe the stock was fairly valued at current levels, as the data did not suggest a 2024 super cycle. However, Piper noted upgrade expectations were up from the 20% level in its Spring 2024 survey. In addition, only about 30% of teens were upgrading any of their Apple hardware in the next six months due to Apple Intelligence, which to the firm felt low given the enthusiasm. Piper acknowledged that the average iPhone among teens was about 3 generations behind the iPhone 16, meaning these older models could just be due for an upgrade.

Title: ‘Digitizing The Dollar’—BlackRock CEO Reveals His Radical Plan For AI-Powered Crypto That’s Predicted To Blow Up The Price Of Bitcoin And Ethereum

The bitcoin price has fallen back from a 2024 all-time high of over $70,000 per bitcoin, reached on a tidal wave of interest in BlackRock's spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF)—with the $11 trillion asset manager chief executive Larry Fink issuing a "crazy" Federal Reserve warning last week. Now, as MicroStrategy's Michael Saylor reveals his $100 trillion "end game," Fink has outlined his plan for bitcoin, ethereum and crypto—predicting "digitizing the dollar" is going to be "under discussion." Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink has predicted bitcoin will spark a digital revolution on Wall ... [+] Street, pushing the bitcoin price sharply higher... "We believe bitcoin is asset class in itself, it is an alternative to other commodities like gold," Fink, who last year led the charge on Wall Street to bring a fully-fledged spot bitcoin ETF to U.S. markets, said during BlackRock's third quarter earnings call, predicting bitcoin, ethereum and crypto will "overlay" with artificial intelligence. "And so I think the application of this form of investment will be expanded. Two, the role of ethereum as a blockchain can grow dramatically. So if we can create more acceptability, more transparency, more analytics related to these assets, then it will be expanded." Bitcoin and ethereum, via the new crypto ETFs that offer exposure to crypto without having to deal with exchanges or risk self-custody, have helped BlackRock’s assets under management to top $11 trillion for the first time over the third quarter. BlackRock's IBIT has seen net inflows of $21.7 billion since January, far outpacing Fidelity's second-largest spot bitcoin ETF with $10 billion of inflows, according to SoSoValue data. "When major players like BlackRock and Fidelity launch bitcoin ETFs, and begin selling that idea to their institutional and individual investors, I think it's very positive," Anthony Scaramucci, the founder of hedge fund SkyBridge Capital, said in a interview with investment platform Saxo—putting his bitcoin price target at $170,000. The arrival of a fleet of spot bitcoin ETFs on Wall Street this year was the first step in what Fink branded a digital "revolution" when he revealed his crypto ambitions for BlackRock last year—which includes a radical new, blockchain-based alternative to the U.S. dollar.

"I truly believe we will see a broadening of the market of these digital assets," Fink said, pointing to BlackRock's experience with the mortgage market that grew along with data and analytics—"And then we’ll see how does each and every country looks at their own digital currency. That’s a very different asset than a bitcoin in itself. But I do believe what we’re going to witness as we build out better analytics." Fink called attempts in India and Brazil to digitize their currencies as a "big success." "How do we see in [the U.S.] the role of digitizing the dollar? And what role does that play," Fink asked. "That’s a very different question related to, let’s say, bitcoin and other items like that. But all of that is going to be under discussion." The debate around a digital dollar, also known as a central bank digital currency (CBDC), was electrified in 2019 when Facebook (now Meta) announced it was planning to launch a bitcoin-inspired digital currency before it was shut down by regulators. The possibility of a digital dollar, often compared to the digital yuan that's already widely used in China and used to monitor people's every day transactions, has sparked privacy concerns as well as questions over how it would impact the commercial, deposit-based financial system. Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has said the Fed won't create a digital dollar without the express authorization from Congress. One Community. Many Voices.

Jonathan Reynolds, the business secretary, will hold a private session on Monday to scrutinise the government’s industrial strategy green paper, Sky News learns. City editor @MarkKleinmanSky Monday 14 October 2024 01:50, UK The government will on Monday welcome more than £50bn of investment in the British economy as Sir Keir Starmer tries to reset his administration after a first hundred days marked by scandal and infighting. Sky News has learnt that the International Investment Summit in the City of London will comprise more than £50bn of deal announcements - or roughly twice the £28bn unveiled at the previous comparable gathering held under the former Conservative administration. The total figure to be announced on Monday was still being finalised this weekend amid continuing negotiations with companies. Politics latest: Minister doesn't rule out raising employer NI Sources said, however, that the final amount would "certainly" be in excess of £50bn. The summit will be attended by executives from globally important companies such as Alphabet, BlackRock, Goldman Sachs and Deepmind. In recent days, a row emerged involving DP World, which had been planning to announce a £1bn investment in the London Gateway port. The company threatened to cancel its attendance at the conference and review the investment in the wake of comments by the transport secretary, Louise Haigh, labelling its P&O Ferries subsidiary "a rogue operator". After Downing Street officials intervened, the dispute appeared to have been resolved this weekend, with the investment proceeding. Sky News can also reveal that the summit will include a behind-closed-doors session chaired by the business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, and a number of chief executives. Keep up with all the latest news from the UK and around the world by following Sky News The group will, according to insiders, jointly scrutinise a green paper on industrial strategy that will also be published on Monday. One invitee said they had been "asked to mark the government's homework". A source close to Mr Reynolds said: "When the business secretary said this government would work in partnership with business, he meant it. "We respect the expertise of business leaders and want their voice at the heart of policymaking. "That's why we're getting them around the table before the strategy is published, so it works for the industries it's designed to benefit." On Friday, Sky News revealed that Sir Keir would use his speech at the investment summit to say that his administration will scrutinise watchdogs across a range of industries to ensure that they are not acting as barriers to growth.

The event is being seen as a test of Labour's economic agenda in the eyes of investors which wield influence over the destination of trillions of pounds of investment funding. His speech will come, however, against the backdrop of a financial crisis at Thames Water, Britain's biggest water utility, which is backed by sovereign wealth funds and pension funds from countries including Abu Dhabi, Canada and China. Reports in recent weeks have suggested that global investors have become so alarmed by Ofwat's approach to the Thames Water crisis that they are reluctant to commit further sums to British infrastructure projects.

The company's assets under custody and/or administration surpassed $50 trillion for the first time, marking a significant milestone. The acquisition of Archer is expected to enhance BNY's asset servicing capabilities and expand its wealth management offerings. Additionally, the introduction of Alts Bridge aims to provide wealth advisers with improved access to alternative investments. Despite ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties, BNY Mellon maintained a positive outlook, projecting flat core expenses for 2024 and aiming to return over 100% of earnings to shareholders. The company's transition to a platform operating model is anticipated to drive growth and efficiency, with full implementation expected within 18 months. BNY Mellon also highlighted its commitment to AI investment, establishing a dedicated hub with several hundred employees. This strategic focus on AI is expected to enhance revenue opportunities and improve employee efficiency. The earnings call reflected BNY Mellon's strong performance across various financial metrics and its continued focus on strategic initiatives to drive growth and innovation in the face of market challenges. BNY Mellon's strong third-quarter performance is further supported by data from InvestingPro. The company's market capitalization stands at $54.48 billion, reflecting its significant presence in the financial services sector. One of the most notable InvestingPro Tips is that BNY Mellon has raised its dividend for 13 consecutive years, demonstrating a consistent commitment to shareholder returns. This aligns with the company's stated goal of returning over 100% of earnings to shareholders, as mentioned in the earnings call. The company's P/E ratio (adjusted) of 13.98 for the last twelve months suggests that the stock may be undervalued relative to its earnings potential. This is further supported by another InvestingPro Tip indicating that BNY Mellon is trading at a low P/E ratio relative to its near-term earnings growth. BNY Mellon's strong financial performance is also reflected in its impressive price total returns. The company has seen a 22.03% return over the last three months and a remarkable 82.48% return over the past year. These figures align with the InvestingPro Tip highlighting the company's strong return over the last three months. It's worth noting that BNY Mellon is currently trading near its 52-week high, with its price at 97.37% of the 52-week high. This information, combined with the company's robust earnings report, suggests continued investor confidence in BNY Mellon's performance and outlook. For investors seeking more comprehensive insights, InvestingPro offers 11 additional tips for BNY Mellon, providing a deeper understanding of the company's financial health and market position. Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the 2024 Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call hosted by BNY. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference call and webcast will be recorded and will consist of copyrighted material. You may not record or rebroadcast these materials without BNY's consent. I will now turn the call over to Marius Merz, BNY Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Marius Merz: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. I'm joined by Robin Vince, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Dermot McDonogh, our Chief Financial Officer. As usual, we will reference our financial highlights presentation, which can be found on the Investor Relations page of our website at bny.com. I'll also note that our remarks will contain forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Information about these statements and non-GAAP measures are available in the earnings press release, financial supplement and financial highlights presentation, all available on the Investor Relations page of our website. Forward-looking statements made on this call speak only as of today, October 11, 2024, and will not be updated. With that, I will turn it over to Robin. Robin Vince: Thanks, Marius. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. I'll start with a few remarks on the quarter, and then Dermot will take you through the financials in greater detail. In short, BNY reported strong third quarter results, reflecting growth across our three business segments and consistent execution on our strategic priorities. Stepping back, on the macro side for a moment. At the beginning of the year, markets had priced in significant monetary policy easing in anticipation of economic slowdowns. Despite numerous shifts in the macroeconomic outlook since then, we've now seen the start of the easing cycle in several markets around the world, including a 50-basis-point reduction in policy rates in the U.S. as the Federal Reserve recalibrates its policy stance to balance employment, inflation and growth. Following increased market volatility and a sell-off in equities in early August, markets recovered, and both equity and fixed income values ended the quarter higher. A little more micro, but relevant for markets. Around the most recent quarter-end, the market saw simultaneous flows into the Fed's reverse repo facility alongside the first meaningful usage of the standing repo facility, both of which we administer. At the same time, sponsored cleared repo volumes increased on the back of higher repo rates, possibly signaling a transition from abundant to ample reserves in the system, with potential implication for the pace of QT going forward. More broadly, while markets have been constructive, there are clearly risks and uncertainties ahead. And so, we constantly prepare and position for the many tail risks that exist from geopolitical tensions and conflicts to fiscal deficits and the impact of impending regulations and elections. Now, referring to Page 2 of the Financial Highlights presentation. As I said earlier, BNY delivered a strong financial performance in the third quarter, with strong EPS growth on the back of broad-based revenue growth and positive operating leverage. Reported earnings per share of $1.50 were up 22% year-over-year. And excluding notable items, earnings per share of $1.52 were up 20%. Total revenue of $4.6 billion increased by 5% year-over-year, and reported expenses of $3.1 billion were flat. Excluding the impact of notable items, expenses were up 1% year-over-year, as we continue to invest in our people and technology, while we also generate greater efficiencies from running our company in new and better ways. Pre-tax margin and return on tangible common equity improved year-over-year to 33% and 23%, respectively. For the first time in our history, we reported over $50 trillion of assets under custody and/or administration at the end of the quarter. Now, custody is not something we are, but it is something important that we do. This number one market position improves our unique vantage point as a global financial services company, and it provides opportunity to drive value across our portfolio of adjacent businesses to deliver more of BNY to our clients. We increasingly see that the true power of BNY's client franchise exists in the combination of capabilities across our leading Security Services, Market and Wealth Services, and Investments and Wealth businesses. We have the ability to enhance this and to deliver more to our clients by bringing new innovative solutions to the market from across the seams of these businesses. As an example, we recently announced the planned acquisition of Archer, a leading technology-enabled service provider of managed account solutions to the asset and wealth management Industry. Archer provides comprehensive technology and operational solutions that allow asset and wealth managers to access one of the fastest-growing investment vehicles in the industry, managed accounts, at scale, expanding distribution, streamlining operations, launching new investment products and delivering personalized outcomes for their clients. The integration of Archer should produce a positive impact across several of our lines of business. In addition to augmenting our asset servicing capabilities for managed accounts, Archer will provide our investments business as well as our Wove wealth advisor platform in Pershing with expanded distribution of model portfolios and access to Archer's multi-custodial network. Buy it once, use it many, if you will. The transaction is expected to close before the end of the year, and we look forward to welcoming the Archer team to BNY. Another one of the fastest-growing areas in financial services, alternatives, also presents a promising opportunity for us to deliver new client solutions across One BNY. We already have relationships with hundreds of alternatives managers as well as roughly $3 trillion of wealth assets on our platforms. We believe there is more for us to do to mine the opportunity and build the technology to reach across our franchise and unlock the fast-growing alternatives market for wealth intermediaries, advisers and the investors they serve. Last month, we introduced Alts Bridge, a comprehensive data, software and services solution built for wealth advisers. Alts Bridge aims to make investing in alternatives easier for advisers through a streamlined end-to-end experience and direct integration into advisers' existing desktops, starting with our Pershing NetX360+ and Wove platforms. As we continue to deliver new innovative products, we are also addressing the significant opportunity from enhancing our commercial model, making it easier for clients to navigate BNY. In order to accomplish this, we are promoting an enterprise approach to client coverage, and we are operationalizing our new commercial model. For example, over the summer and for the first time in recent memory, we brought together several hundred of BNY's client-facing commercial leaders from around the world as well as members of our executive committee for a two-day event we called Commercial Lift Off. This program enabled our top client coverage people and their business partners to take a One BNY view to account planning, creating a shared vision for serving each of our clients holistically across the entire relationship, generating new ideas to meet the clients' objectives and developing action-oriented plans to deliver on those goals. During the quarter, we also made progress toward running our company better, including the ongoing transition to a platform's operating model, enhancing the connectivity across our teams and empowering our people to drive change across the company. In September, we went live with the next step on our multiyear plan to unite related capabilities around BNY and elevate our execution by doing things in one place and doing them well. We now have about 13,000 or about one-quarter of our people working in our new operating model. As we've said before, powering our One BNY culture in order to be more for our clients and run our company better requires not just words, but action. I want to thank our people around the world for their hard work and for collectively pulling together as a team to create the change for our clients, for our shareholders and for one another. To wrap up, the combination of our talented team, our portfolio of leading businesses working together and the strength of our balance sheet gives us a great foundation to deliver more to our clients and drive sustainable long-term shareholder value. While our results in the third quarter demonstrate continued execution against our strategic priorities as well as progress toward our medium-term financial targets, our team remains focused on the work ahead. With that, over to you, Dermot. Dermot McDonogh: Thank you, Robin, and good morning, everyone. Starting on Page 3 of the presentation, I'll begin with our consolidated financial results for the quarter. Total revenue of $4.6 billion was up 5% year-over-year. Fee revenue was up 5%. This includes 5% growth in investment services fees, reflecting higher market values and net new business across our Security Services and Market and Wealth Services segments. Investment management and performance fees from our Investment and Wealth Management segment were up 2%, driven by higher market values, partially offset by the mix of AUM flows and lower performance fees. Firm-wide AUC/A of $52.1 trillion were up 14% year-over-year, reflecting higher market values, net new business and client inflows. Assets under management of $2.1 trillion were up 18% year-over-year, primarily reflecting higher market values and the favorable impact of a weaker dollar. Foreign exchange revenue increased by 14%, driven by higher volumes. Investment and other revenue was $196 million in the quarter, reflecting continued strength in fixed income and equity trading. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects a strategic equity investment loss recorded in the third quarter of last year and improved results from our seed capital investments. Net interest income increased by 3% year-over-year, primarily reflecting improved investment securities portfolio yields and balance sheet growth, partially offset by changes in deposit mix. Expenses of $3.1 billion were flat year-over-year on a reported basis and up 1% excluding notable items. This reflects higher investment and employee merit increases, partially offset by efficiency savings. Provision for credit losses was $23 million in the quarter, primarily reflecting reserve bills related to commercial real estate exposure. As Robin mentioned earlier, we reported earnings per share of $1.50, up 22% year-over-year. And excluding notable items, earnings per share were $1.52, up 20% year-over-year. Pre-tax margin was 33%, and return on tangible common equity was 23%. Turning to capital and liquidity on Page 4. Our Tier 1 leverage ratio for the quarter was 6%. Tier 1 capital increased by 4% sequentially, primarily reflecting capital generated through earnings and improvement in accumulated other comprehensive income, partially offset by capital returned to our shareholders through common stock repurchases and through dividends. Average assets increased by 1%. Our CEQ1 ratio at the end of the quarter was 11.9%. CEQ1 capital increased by 5% and risk-weighted assets increased by 1%. We returned $1.1 billion of capital to our shareholders over the course of the third quarter. Year-to-date, we returned 103% of our earnings through dividends and buybacks. Moving to liquidity. The consolidated liquidity coverage ratio was 116%, a 1 percentage point increase sequentially due to a favorable change in our deposit composition. And the consolidated net stable funding ratio was 132%, unchanged sequentially. Next, net interest income and the underlying balance sheet trends on Page 5. Net interest income of over $1 billion was up 3% year-over-year and up 2% quarter-over-quarter. The sequential increase was helped by higher sponsored cleared repo activity [indiscernible] market volatility and increased client demand. Average deposit balances remained flat sequentially. Noninterest-bearing deposits decreased by 2% in the quarter and interest-bearing deposits were flat. Average interest-earning assets were [up 4%] (ph) quarter-over-quarter. Our investment securities portfolio balances as well as loan balances increased by 1%, and cash and reverse repo balances remained flat. Our broader liquidity ecosystem reached an all-time high at the end of the quarter of over $1.5 trillion worth of client cash across deposits, money market funds, securities lending, sponsor cleared repo and other short-term investment alternatives. Turning to our business segments, starting on Page 6. Security Services reported total revenue of $2.2 billion, up 6% year-over-year. Total investment services fees were up 4% year-over-year. In Asset Servicing, investment services fees grew by 5%, primarily reflecting higher market values. For the third quarter in a row, the impact of repricing was de minimis. ETF AUC/A of $2.7 trillion was up more than 70% year-on-year, and the number of funds serviced was up 20% year-on-year. Inflows into ETFs on our platform remained strong this quarter with growth across all asset classes. As the ETF industry continues to grow, we are dedicated to scaling our best-in-class ETF service offering. For example, we have successfully onboarded several new liquidity providers to our electronic order execution platform to advance digital adoption. In Issuer Services, investment services fees were up 1%. Net new business and higher client activity in Corporate Trust partially offset by lower deposit receipt fees, reflecting corporate actions in the prior year. Against the backdrop of increased issuance activity, we continue to see strength in Corporate Trust, capitalizing on our investments in people and technology to enhance client service and scalability. In this segment, foreign exchange revenue was up 28% year-over-year, reflecting growth from newly onboarded clients as well as a higher level of client activity. Net interest income for the segment was up 2% year-over-year. Segment expenses of $1.6 billion were down 3% year-over-year, reflecting efficiency savings and lower severance expenses, partially offset by higher investments and employee merit increases. Pre-tax income was $642 million, a 38% increase year-over-year, and pre-tax margin was 29%. Next, Market and Wealth Services on Page 7. Market and Wealth Services reported total revenue of $1.5 billion, up 7% year-over-year. Total investment services fees were up 7% year-over-year. In Pershing, investment services fees were down 1%, reflecting the impact of lost business in the prior year, partially offset by higher market values. Net new assets were negative $22 billion for the quarter, reflecting the ongoing deconversion of lost business in the prior year, which is now largely behind us. Excluding the deconversion, we saw approximately 4% annualized net new asset growth in the third quarter. Wove continues to see strong client demand. We signed up 14 additional clients in the third quarter and we remain on track for the $30 million to $40 million of revenue in 2024 as we guided in January. Wove is helping us attract new clients and deepen relationships with existing ones. For example, Pershing provides custody and clearing solutions for Sanctuary, a large and fast-growing wealth manager servicing the high net worth and ultra-high net worth segments. Sanctuary will also leverage Wove portfolio solutions, trading and rebalancing and reporting for teams that custody with Pershing as well as those that use another custodian. In Clearance and Collateral Management, investment services fees increased by 16%, primarily reflecting higher collateral management fees and higher clearance volumes. Against the backdrop of a growing market and active trading, U.S. securities clearance and settlement volumes have remained strong. As you may remember, we created our global clearing platform earlier this year through the realignment of Pershing Institutional Solutions. We're pleased to see the pipeline of this platform continue to build for our full suite of institutional clearing, settlement, execution and financing solutions in over 100 markets around the world. In Treasury Services, investment services fees were up 11%, primarily reflecting net new business. The business continues to execute well against the growth agenda we presented in January. And we are seeing our investments in modernizing and digitizing our payments platform pay off in the form of growth in our strategic target markets. Net interest income for the segment overall was up 3% year-over-year. Segment expenses of $834 million were up 5% year-over-year, reflecting higher investments and employee merit increases, partially offset by efficiency savings. Pre-tax income was up 8% year-over-year at $704 million, representing a 46% pre-tax margin. Turning to Investment and Wealth Management on Page 8. Investment and Wealth Management reported total revenue of $849 million, up 2% year-over-year. In our Investment Management business, revenue was up 1%, reflecting higher market values and improved [seed capital] (ph) results, partially offset by lower performance fees and the mix of AUM flows. And in Wealth Management, revenue increased by 6%, reflecting higher market values and net interest income, partially offset by changes in product mix. Segment expenses of $672 million were flat year-over-year as efficiency savings offset employee merit increases and higher investments. Pre-tax income was $176 million, up 7% year-over-year, and pre-tax margin was 21%. As I mentioned earlier, assets under management of $2.1 trillion increased by 18% year-over-year, primarily reflecting higher market values and the favorable impact of the weaker dollar. In the third quarter, we saw strength in our short-term strategies with $24 billion of net inflows into cash, reflecting our leading position and strong investment performance in our Dreyfus money market funds. Long-term active strategies saw $8 billion of net outflows, spread across multi asset, LDI and active equity, partially offset by net inflows into fixed income. And we saw $16 billion of net outflows from index strategies. Wealth Management client assets of $333 billion increased by 14% year-over-year, reflecting higher market values and cumulative net inflows. Page 9 shows the results of the other segment. Before I wrap up, a couple of comments on the outlook for the year. Starting with net interest income. Remember, we began the year setting up for positive operating leverage despite an expectation for full year net interest income to be down 10% in 2024. While we're currently forecasting for fourth quarter net interest income to be slightly below what we saw in our strong third quarter results, the resilience of our net interest income over the first nine months of the year has positioned us to outperform our outlook for the full year net interest income growth rate from January by approximately 5 percentage points. Regarding expenses, we continue to work hard to keep core expenses, excluding notable items, for the full year 2024 roughly flat. We now expect our effective tax rate for the full year 2024 to be at the lower end of the 23% to 24% range we estimated in January. And lastly, as we said at the beginning of the year, we expect to return 100% or more of 2024 earnings to our shareholders through dividends and buybacks. And we remain on track having returned 103% of earnings year-to-date. In conclusion, our results this past quarter reflect broad-based growth across our three business segments and continued progress on our strategic priorities. We're pleased with the company's performance year-to-date and we're proud of our people who continue to execute well toward our medium-term financial targets, while we all remain focused on the work and the tremendous opportunity ahead of us. With that, operator, can you please open the line for Q&A? Operator: Yes. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Brennan Hawken: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. You flagged some of the ETF wins that you had in the servicing side. So, curious about that. Number one, how much of that was the BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) business that you've won? And has the revenue from that win, that big win fully turned on? And did those dynamics have something -- or like is the fee rate lower? Because fees in asset servicing were up about 5%, but AUC, 16%, and I know sometimes the ETF fee rates are a little lower, so curious to flush that out a bit. Thank you. Dermot McDonogh: So, thanks for the question. I don't really want to get into the specifics on one client or transaction, but just to take a step back on ETFs generally, it is a growing market. You may have watched Larry from BlackRock on CNBC this morning. It is a secular trend. It is a very big and growing market, and we are a key player on that. As I said in my prepared remarks, we have $2.7 trillion on the platform, that's up 70% year-on-year, and the number of funds serviced is up 20%. That's on the back of strong leadership and a real investment in technology, so we can be best in class. So, without going into specifics, we're there to take advantage of the secular trend and we'll continue to innovate and solve for our clients' needs. Brennan Hawken: Okay. Thanks for that. Maybe if I could word it a little differently, the strong ETF growth that you have seen this quarter, is the revenue fully reflected this quarter or is some of those wins still have some revenue ramp to come? Dermot McDonogh: I would say it's the latter. It's, generally speaking, strong pipeline. We're always adding new clients to the platform and they -- because of the size of what's been on boarded, they tend to do it in a phased approach. So, some revenue is on the platform, some revenue to come. Brennan Hawken: Excellent. Thanks for that, Dermot. Thank you also for the update on NII, encouraging to see things working better. Could you speak to the deposit beta that you experienced with the first rate cut? And given that we're seeing rates coming down now, is it reasonable to think that deposits could begin to grow from here? Dermot McDonogh: So, the betas, I think, we've said on previous calls, we view it as symmetrical. So, for us, the first rate cut was 100% passed on. So, we feel pretty good about that. I think in terms of where we are in the Fed easing cycle, I think it's probably a little bit too early to see how that's going to feed into the deposit balance story. I think, overall, we've kind of -- we've held in there. We had a strong Q3 for a variety of different reasons. So, I would say, I expect where we are to moderate a little bit on balances in Q4 and we'll see what happens next with the next Fed meeting, but no significant change for us as we kind of sit here right here today. Brennan Hawken: Great. Thank you for taking my questions. Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll move to our next question from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Mike Mayo: Hey, how are you doing? Robin Vince: Hey, Mike. How are you? Mike Mayo: Good. Look, I'm just -- that's a big number, the $50 trillion of AUC, nice round number. You did beat -- it's factual that you beat expectations for the quarter and the year so far, as you've highlighted. I'm just trying to figure out how much of this is lucky versus being smart. And I imagine it's a bit of both, but the lucky part is record stock market volatility, trading, some other factors in the market that have gone your way. And I don't feel like we have enough information on your client growth, the underlying client growth, the most repeatable part of the company. So, could you give some color on whether it's growth in clients or maybe it's revenues per client or maybe it's products per client or all those adjacent businesses that you talk about, how you're managing the company better versus simply a better environment to operate it? Robin Vince: Sure, Mike. It's Robin. I understand the question and it's obviously a very legit question. We broke through the $50 trillion. By the way, we ended at $52 trillion. So, the good news is we didn't stop at the round number. Look, I'd say that it isn't just fashionable, it's actually old-fashioned traditional just the way that we want to do it in terms of being able to have this deliberate growth and this focus. And so, we've tried to provide as much visibility as we reasonably can into the inputs of what it is that's ultimately driving this progress, because we understand we have benefited from a terrific backdrop in terms of markets. And of course, that's part of our business to be able to be well-positioned to take advantage of those backdrops. We've got parts of our business which respond to asset values, we've got parts of our business that respond to the number of accounts, we've got parts of our business that respond to software sales, transaction volumes, and having that multi-faceted set of business response functions, if you want to call it, that is actually a deliberate strategy so that we can participate in the growth of markets. And so, if you believe that overall debt issued in the world, equity valuations in the world, financial market activities are going to grow, we're trying to hitch our wagon to all of those growth trends. We think that's good. Having said that, to the heart of your question, this is the work that we've really done in the early days since this management team took over, which was to understand the components that we had and to really start to understand how they could work together, to how they could hum together in order to be able to unlock more potential. And so, we rallied the firm around three strategic pillars, this thing of being more for our clients. And that's just not just words, it's being about maturing this One BNY philosophy that we've talked before about. It's about having a different type of dialogue. It's about the movement over time to solutions as opposed to just products. It's like the examples that I gave and Dermot gave in our prepared remarks where clients are coming to us because we can do more than one thing for them. And it's not just that we're selling more things to them, it's that they actually want to take advantage of bundles of things, which actually provide a better solution to their business. And then, our second pillar of running the company better, that's been about sales rhythms and sales targets and bringing our people together and having them understand what it is that we're trying to do. And then, wrapping the whole thing is this culture of wanting to have a winning culture, wanting to push forward, wanting to make BNY of the future more than BNY Mellon was of the past. And those things are all quite deliberate, and we start -- and we believe that we're starting to see the results of that, although it's still early in our results. But Dermot can give you a couple of additional things on this which I think also would be helpful. Dermot McDonogh: So Mike, the way I -- from just thinking about it from a numbers perspective, right, we're up 5% year-on-year in fee growth, and constructive markets, and so, we've been able to take advantage of constructive markets. But a couple of important points that I would draw out is that in all three of our business segments, we've seen solid underlying growth. And in Robin's prepared remarks, he talked about the fact that we're evolving into a platform company. And when we have platforms that we're investing in at scale, so when you have high volume and you have constructive markets, we have the platforms in situ that can take advantage of that. Asset Servicing, we're winning and onboarding new business. We came into the year with a backlog. We onboarded the business throughout the year, and we're beginning to go into the Q4 with a bigger backlog than we came into the beginning of the year. So, Asset Servicing, I feel very proud of. Corporate Trust, Depository Receipts, Corporate Trust, specifically, a good margin business, but something that has been devoid of investment over a number of years and we've put money to work there in terms of leadership and scaling our technology, and that's going to be a business -- an important business for us in the future. And Treasury and Services and Clearance and Collateral Management have really kind of shown was when you have a scale platform with high volumes, strong markets, lots of issuance, lots of payments, you take advantage of that. And then, on just the client specific thing, albeit it's a small base and we can -- we've highlighted a couple of transactions this year where client -- we're able to have a much more sophisticated conversation with clients and clients are now buying from us across more than one line of business, in some cases, four lines of business. That was something that we just could not do a couple of years ago. And Robin's point about bringing the One BNY to bear on clients is really beginning to pay dividends. Mike Mayo: All right. Well, that was very comprehensive. Just last follow-up, are you implying, and by the way, on all the metrics, again, the client growth numbers, and thanks for peeling back the layers of the onion there, but always like even more layers, never enough for us, but in terms of growth in clients and more specifics going down the line. But the expense is clearly, Dermot, the flat expenses, that's very clear, that part of it. Are you implying even lower expenses in the fourth quarter based on your new guide today? Dermot McDonogh: So, look, the thing I would like to convey to you and to our shareholders is that we worked really hard over the last couple of years to build credibility that we are good stewards of our expense base, and we guided flat at the beginning of the year. And broadly speaking, there's been some pressure, I would say, on expenses that, for the most part, are revenue related. And so, if revenues are higher, there's some aspects that you just have to pay more expenses. So, while I've guided roughly flat for the full year, there may be a little bit of pressure over the course of that because of higher revenues. And also, as Robin said in his remarks, we've announced the acquisition of Archer and there'll be some integration costs associated with that. But I feel very good the fact that now we have 53,000 people who understand the importance of financial discipline and that goes to pillar number two of being a really well-run company. Mike Mayo: All right. Thank you. Operator: We'll move to our next question from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell: Great. Thanks. Good morning, folks. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe just on -- just sticking with the revenue dynamic, talking about the -- obviously, the commercial lift off and the enterprise approach, the early traction that you're getting, I think, you referenced some clients now doing multiple services. Can you talk a little bit more about how you think that might impact the revenue growth trajectory? And then, also, just if you can just reconfirm the general revenue delta to equity markets? I think it was like 10% equity market moves can have an impact of about 1% revenue. So, I just wanted to sort of break apart those two dynamics, just really kind of showing that you're actually generating this revenue growth aside from markets. Dermot McDonogh: So, if I take the last question first, hopefully, that was your two questions in one go, so, a 5% gradual change in equity markets is roughly $60 million in fees annually, and a 5% gradual change in fixed income markets is roughly 40% -- or $40 million in fees annually. So that's a little bit on the sensitivity analysis. And so, on just the commercial lift off that Robin talked about in his remarks, it really is -- Cathinka Wahlstrom, who's with us now for over a year, spent the first year really on a listening tour and organizing roughly our 1,200 to 1,500 leading client coverage people around the world in terms of what we want our ambition to be, what are the products that we have and how can we educate our total force to be able to [indiscernible] there with clients delivering the whole of the firm. I think -- and also, if you kind of just talk about Archer for a second, I think a couple of years ago, if we were to do that acquisition, one part of the firm would have bought it for its business. And I think, Robin's point in his remarks are really, really important where you buy it once, you use it multiple times, and it's an acquisition that's done for the enterprise that will serve multiple lines of business. And that's how you should think about how our client coverage model is going to work in a strategic way going forward. We're going to deliver holistic solutions for our clients. Clients have a better understanding of the diversified nature of our business franchise, and they're just buying more from us. And it's just going to show up in revenue, and we feel very good about where we are today in terms of planning for the budget season for Q4 and the opportunities that are going to come our way in 2025. Brian Bedell: Great. That's helpful. I'll get back in the queue for another question actually. Operator: We'll move to our next question from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Alex Blostein: Thanks. Good morning, guys. So, maybe just wrapping some of the comments you made around fee in a bigger picture question, when you guys think about a number of different growth areas you outlined some of the specifics, and obviously, the approach to cross-selling has taken a whole different turn here. So, when you use them out and you look at the business holistically, how do you think about the organic fee growth that the enterprise can generate over time? Dermot McDonogh: So, you're trying -- so we don't guide on fees, haven't done, don't intend to do it here, but what I would say is, and I gave this answer as an earlier question, we are seeing underlying growth across all three of our business segments. Our underlying organic growth this year, we feel quite happy about, and we feel it reflects a really good nine months of the year. And there's no reason to expect that, that momentum won't continue. And I do feel the way we've set up for the back half of this year and into next year, it's a kind of flywheel of innovation, and we have a lot of growth initiatives. And we've come together and we have a group of people who are working on what we call integrated solutions. And so, we have a number of interesting things in the pipeline. Robin talked about Alts Bridge in his remarks, talked about Archer in his remarks. There are things that we're doing within specific lines of business coming together. We talked about Pershing being realigned into Clearance and Collateral Management, and that's driving growth as well. So, the decisions that we've taken over the last couple of years in terms of realigning certain activities into different parts of the firm are showing up in our revenues this year, and we will continue to do that into next year. Robin Vince: And Alex, I'd just add, Dermot really alluded to this in what he just said, but right from the beginning, we've had two approaches. One is to think about this endeavor of fully realizing BNY's potential as a multiyear endeavor, and we recognize that there are going to be different ways in which that will come together in different years. And North Star, as you know, for us, is operating leverage, and that came about in a slightly different way in 2023 than it did in '24, and it could be different again in '25 as we really get into that conversation ultimately when we talk to you in January. But we've simultaneously invested in things that we knew would be important for the shorter term and for the medium term and for the longer term. And so, both Dermot and I have talked about this platform's operating model. That's a great example. There have been some benefits that come early on in that process. We brought like things together across the company. There have been benefits on the revenue side, there have been benefits on the expense side from doing it. But then, the value of having done it creates medium-term momentum because now we're able to be more dynamic for clients. We're able to solve problems more quickly for clients. And so, there's a payoff there. And then, over the longer term, it actually makes it easier to be able to assemble these new solutions that Dermot was just talking about. And again, there's a revenue story there, but there's also an expense story. And that's how we're thinking about it. Notwithstanding, we haven't given you a specific growth target number. Make no mistake, we're invested in creating that growth. Alex Blostein: Yeah. No, fair enough. I appreciate all of that. Smaller kind of tactical question for you guys. So, the repo activity continues to be quite elevated. You mentioned that in your prepared remarks as well. Is it possible to help size how much repo contributed sort of across the enterprise? It hits you in a couple of different ways. Obviously, there's the NII benefit and there's some fee benefits. So, as you think about the more normalized level of repo activity versus what you saw in the quarter, how big of a contributor was that in kind of totality? And as you look forward, given changes in monetary policy expectations, but also some of the client behavior that you mentioned earlier, how sustainable do you ultimately think this more elevated pace of activity in this market? Dermot McDonogh: So, on the repo question, so at cleared repo, for sure, we saw elevated activity, particularly going into the back end of the quarter and in the early part of this quarter. And that, in large part, contributed to the outperformance for the Q3 NII. That has now moderated somewhat. And so, in my prepared remarks, and in terms of the guidance, that's why I kind of feel like roughly for NII, we're about $1 billion for the fourth quarter. In terms of cleared repo, overall, as a kind of contributor to the NII over the course of the year, it's roughly about 5% of the number. As it relates to elevated activity in terms of volume and activity, I think from what we see on our platforms, we kind of see that continuing to be the case in the medium term. There's no reason for the slowdown. It's been a very strong year, very, very active client engagement, product innovation. And particularly on the international side, we said at the beginning of the year in our kind of strategic call in January that international was going to be a key area of ​​focus on the platform, and that's been the case, and that's shown up in the results. So, I think, overall, and I said in my prepared remarks as well, in terms of the liquidity ecosystem in total hit a high for us at $1.5 trillion. That's up from $1.2 trillion a couple of years ago, and that's in the backdrop of liquidity coming out of the system. So, we've grown quite substantially. And that, again, is coming back to connecting the dots across the firm, getting teams collaborating more, being more digital, providing innovative solutions to clients, and that is really powering the growth. Robin Vince: If I could just relate that back to a question that Mike had asked earlier on because I think these things are relevant, you got to remember that the strategy of us having roughly the right ores in roughly the right waters to be able to participate in things that are happening in the world, that's very important. So, if I just supplement what Dermot said, with the additional observation that we're the world's largest security lender that generates repo activity. We're the world's largest collateral manager, so we get to capture fees associated with people doing repo. We, obviously, play this role in the US Treasury market, which participates in the growth of US Treasury repo. We have all of these different touch points. And so, there are different ways in which we can collect across software, in some cases, services that we administer in others, and participation in different, both global markets and also product types, which align in indirect ways to that. So that's an important part of how we look at the overall system and understand how our products and services can help clients navigate those, and we can participate in the benefit of that growth. Alex Blostein: Yeah, that's a helpful framework to discuss it this way, yeah. Thank you, guys, both. Operator: We'll move to our next question from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy: Hi, Dermot. Hi, Robin. Robin, can you give us some thoughts with -- obviously, you talked a little bit about the acquisition you accomplished in this quarter. What your outlook is for -- you, obviously, have very strong capital levels, your stock has moved very nicely this year and you get a better currency. What the outlook is for just other types of acquisitions if there are some that could be complementary to what you're currently doing? Robin Vince: Sure, Gerard. First of all, just make a quick comment about Archer. We're looking forward to closing that transaction in the fourth quarter and welcoming the team in. And this relates a little bit to a couple of other things that we've already talked about on the call. One is participation in markets and the other one earlier on, on ETFs. If you just think about the way that we view the world construct, once upon a time, they were mutual funds. More recently in the past decade or so, it's really been the explosion of ETFs. And there's simultaneous thing going on, which is the growth of separately managed accounts. And so, in the same way that Dermot described how we've participated in sort of outsized participation of the ETF migration, Archer is a transaction that prepositions us to be able to participate hopefully in an outsized way associated with the transition to separately managed accounts. So, it relates to that strategic question of growth and participating in different markets that we talked about. Now, stepping back to the other part of your question, really, the heart of it on M&A, look, our primary focus is what we have and how we can improve on it. And Dermot and I both talk a lot about the fact that we've looked very carefully at our businesses and we love our businesses. We think we have a great set of businesses. We think they are great ones to be in, and we think that they have a lot of adjacency to each other. And we think that the spread of those things can provide a lot more services to our clients in more joined up way of solutions than maybe we have before. So, it isn't that we do M&A from a position in any way of needing to do things, it's we're able to be very opportunistic, and we obviously like that a lot. But notwithstanding that we're pleased with what we have, we don't want to be complacent. So, we keep our eyes open, and we look at things, and Archer came about as a result of a strategic business review that we did internally, looking at long-term trends, looking at how we might adapt to those trends. And then, we went out and we looked very specifically for a capability that would do that, with the key emphasis being on the word capability, digestible bolt-on things that accelerate what we're trying to do or derisk delivery of what we're trying to do. And if we can buy a piece of technology that can be more efficient or less distracting than building it ourselves with a great team, great technology, ideally like this one, an installed book of business is also helpful, then we feel very good about it, as long as it aligns with those priorities, it's a good cultural fit, it has a good attractive return. So that's our M&A thought process. And then, if that fits into the overall waterfall, which we've talked about before, which is, if we have excess capital, we're going to, of course, be prudent. And so, we like excess capital. That's not a bad thing in an uncertain world. And so that's a very important consideration. Then, we look at whether or not we could invest it. Good news, as you know, we're a pretty capital-light model, we're very capital generative, so we don't need a ton of capital to reinvest in our business to keep growing it. Then, we look at whether or not we need something -- for some type of additional need, like the Archer example and then we distribute the rest. And this has, obviously, been a good year to see all of that on display. We've been prudent. We've run at elevated capital levels, and, as Dermot indicated, we intend to return 100% plus of net earnings to shareholders, and we've been able to make an acquisition. And so, this is a pretty good model year for how we think about the world. Gerard Cassidy: Very good. Thank you for the answer. And then, just as a quick follow-up, Dermot. You gave us that sensitivity analysis about a gradual 5% change in the equity markets and fixed income and the impact it would have on revenue, was that for up markets, meaning if the gradual increase was 5% up, does that also reflect a down market, if markets were down 5%, that's the kind of impact we would expect to see? Dermot McDonogh: That's correct, Gerard, that's correct. Gerard Cassidy: Okay, great. Thank you. Operator: We'll move to our next question from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Ebrahim Poonawala: Hey, good morning. Robin Vince: Good morning, Ebrahim. Ebrahim Poonawala: I have a follow-up with some of your responses. I think, I guess, depending how -- maybe starting with just capital allocation, so heard your response to Gerard's question around M&A and such. But just talk to us how you think about means when we think about the valuation of the stock on price to earnings, price to tangible book, at the same time, this year has been pretty good market backdrop wise, and as an investor shareholder, you care about ROE resilience of these firms. So, one maybe, Robin or Dermot, talk to us about your comfort around ROE resiliency? If the market backdrop is unfavorable, what's the flex in the system? And given where things stand today, like how do you think about the stock valuation versus the commitment to return 100% plus in buybacks and dividends? Thank you. Robin Vince: I'll take the second bit first, and then Dermot will reflect on the first part of your question. So, the good news is that we can also pay attention to the way that you all think about the stock and your views of our stock. And we appreciate the fact that many of you have expressed confidence in our forward direction. We believe in ourselves as well. And so, what we do, of course, consider price as one of the many inputs into our capital return framework. We don't view current prices as being problematic in terms of continuing our stock buybacks. Dermot McDonogh: Ebrahim, when I took on the role a couple of years ago, I guess, I got a lot of questions about, is this just going to be more of the same or what's different? And now we're several quarters into the new team, and Robin has really kind of bolstered that team and through the strategic pillars, communication, the principles, the medium-term financial targets has really started to evolve the culture of BNY. And so, it is our commitment to deliver to our shareholders' positive operating leverage through the cycle. And so, if you just take a step back and look at this quarter's financials, 5% revenue growth, flat expense growth, 33% pre-tax margin, upper end of Tier 1 leverage, 6%, 23% return on tangible common equity, and a 22% EPS growth, and what I would say is a solid beast. So, I don't really think about the valuation of the firm on any given day. We just care about delivering for our clients and our shareholders. And if we do that in a first-class way, the valuation will take care of itself. Robin Vince: And you asked about the returns and our sort of comfort with them, look, we've given medium-term targets, as Dermot just said, that's sort of greater than or equal to 23% for ROTCE. And so, we, obviously, appreciate touching that, but doing it consistently over time is how we really view achieving targets. And in terms of the resiliency, remember the very nature of our business is actually got this diversification. We talked about the equity markets and the fixed income markets. I talked about the fact that it is software, its services, platforms and market valuations and transaction volumes. These are all things that we participate in. Capital markets activities has been important to us in 2024. The fact that we participate through our Corporate Trust business through our debt capital markets business, those are things that are participating in the growth of capital markets generally. We participate in scale of markets, and things like the treasury market is a good example. And so, this diversification of our mix helps us to be resilient in terms of the vagaries of any one particular market or cycle. Now, of course, things will move around, and that's why Dermot mentioned the point about our commitment to positive operating leverage in almost all reasonable scenarios that we can imagine because we recognize that NII, which is part of our mix, but so too are the fees and then our ability to control expenses. We could make expenses less than they are now. We've chosen to manage them at the level that they are because we believe that investing in that business for future growth is exactly what we should be doing right now given the environment, but it wouldn't always have to be so. Ebrahim Poonawala: Appreciate that. And if I can sneak one quick follow-up, Dermot, I think you mentioned fourth quarter NII slightly lower than 3Q. We've seen a few rate cuts in Europe, in the US now in September. Is it fair to assume that absent a dramatic change in rates, this $1 billion in quarterly NII is kind of where we are bouncing around at the bottom? And then, if deposit growth picks up, QT stops, that it should go off that base? Or am I missing something? Dermot McDonogh: So, if you look back at our last five quarters, we've kind of toggled between $1 billion and $1.1 billion. Q3 was a stronger quarter for us for a number of reasons, principally volatility in the market at the beginning of August and clients held more cash. And then, towards the back end of the quarter, once there was a clear view on where the Fed was going to go at rates, clients started to put money into money market funds, which ended up with us. And so, we kind of benefited from those two principal things. And so, our deposit balances have kind of leveled off here. We expect maybe NIBs grind down a little bit from here. And so, as I kind of said maybe 10 minutes ago, $1 billion for Q4 is the best guidance I can give you today. And for '25, I don't see NII being a kind of a headwind for us. And we've taken extensive action over the last several weeks in terms of repositioning our CIO book to insulate '25. Ebrahim Poonawala: That's helpful. Thank you so much. Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll move to our next question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck: Hi. Good afternoon. Robin Vince: Hey, Betsy. Betsy Graseck: Okay. Two quick questions. One is on the buyback question, and I know you said, look, you're very accretive on earnings accretion. You don't need a lot of capital for the business model, of course, as we know, and you're above your target CET1 of 11% and Tier 1 leverage target 5.5% to 6%, you're at the high end of that range. And so, when we think about the 100%-plus, how should we think about the plus part of the 100%-plus? Because it feels like totally 100% makes sense, but there's room to bring these to optimize the capital structure more. So, I'm kind of thinking about -- I'm wondering what kind of timeframe are we talking about to optimize your capital structure, do you feel? Dermot McDonogh: So, thanks for the question, Betsy. Last year, we returned a little north of 120%. This year, in January, we guided a 100% or more. Given the uncertainty in the markets, geopolitical, the U.S. Presidential elections, a wide range of uncertainty with Fed. In January, we thought the year was going to be very different to where it's ended up. And I think, on previous calls, we said we wanted for now stick towards the upper end of our Tier 1 leverage ratio, which is the 6% range. And so, when you take that and the Archer transaction, we kind of think we're still on track to do the 100% or more through three quarters, we're at 103%. So, I wouldn't expect that to materially change from here. Betsy Graseck: Okay. Got it. And then, the other question is you mentioned one-third of BNY is now on the platform model. And are you taking 100% of the firm there? And just wondering about implications for the runway for efficiency improvements as you execute on that? Thanks. Dermot McDonogh: So, a quarter of the firm, roughly 13,000 employees are on the platform now. It happened in two waves, March and September, with another wave going live in Q1 of next year. And so, I wouldn't necessarily think about platform operating model as a mechanism just for efficiency. It really is -- it's going to drive top-line growth and it's going to run the company better and it's going to help us have a different culture in terms of more joined-up thinking. So, it really is the mechanism by which we deliver the three strategic pillars. And so, the answer to the question about 100% is, yes. And from probably -- from here, it's probably another 18 months before the firm is fully up there. But by the end of Q1 of next year, we expect about half of the firm will be live on the model. And the feedback so far from our team around the world is extraordinarily positive. So, it's really worked well for us as a firm. Robin Vince: And Betsy, you remember the tail of benefit extends way past the 18-month point because sometimes it's not until folks are in the model and operating in that new approach that they're really able to examine some of the core questions that, that platform is confronted with in terms of how to optimize. So, we expect the benefit that Dermot was describing to be a multiyear endeavor past that 18-month point. Betsy Graseck: Got it. All right. Thanks so much. Appreciate it. Operator: We'll move to our next question from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Glenn Schorr: Hello. Just one wrap up for me. Dermot, I love you pointed out the 5% revenue growth, flattish expenses lead to 20% earnings growth. That is the power of the BK model. If you look just -- I know it's just one quarter, but if you look at the sequential numbers, the story changed a little bit with everything about flat and earnings down a little bit. I'm just -- all I'm asking is, does that inform us in any way of how we're looking at as we roll into '25? A lot of your business metrics and balance and client wins are up. So, my gut is, it's no, but I just want to see from that perspective, how you feel about that? Dermot McDonogh: So, I think your gut is correct. It is no, Glenn. And it's all just about timing and when we onboard clients and put people on the platform and when the revenue starts to get recognized. So, it's just in terms of the backlog across all our businesses, strong pipeline continues to grow. And, yeah, so your intuition is correct. Glenn Schorr: All right. Awesome. Thank you. Operator: We'll move to our next question from Rajiv Bhatia with Morningstar. Rajiv Bhatia: Yeah. Just a quick one for me. I guess, on the depository receipts business, and I appreciate it's a small business, but the number of sponsored programs continues to decline. Is that something we should continue to expect to decline? And is it competitive takeaways or something else that's driving that? Thanks. Dermot McDonogh: So, I wouldn't really read too much into that. That's -- we've talked about that for several years about the sponsored program going away and not being around. It's still here. Deposit receipts is a small business in the totality of it, but it is a very, very important business for us because it gives us another opportunity to connect with clients, and it has got a very good margin to it. And we have like very significant market share in that business. So, it's something that we continue to invest in. We think it's very important for our franchise, and we don't see a secular decline in that business from where we see it today. Robin Vince: We also off-boarded some of the smaller clients in that particular business. So, the headline of total number is a little bit misleading actually when -- if you were able to dig under the hood and see some of the clients that made up that decline, you'd see that they disproportionately skewed to the small. Rajiv Bhatia: Got it. Thank you. Operator: We'll move to our next question from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global Securities. Jim Mitchell: My questions have all been asked and answered. Thanks. Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll move to our next question from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell: Great. Thanks for taking my follow-up. Just one more on the margins. You mostly at your 33% target in most areas. So, as you generate more sales from moving to the platform model, and as we move into, say, next year or beyond, I guess, what's the view on spending some of that and investing in the business versus actually generating -- potentially generating margins well above 33%? Dermot McDonogh: So, my response to that one, Jim, would be, we want to demonstrate to you that we can prove that we can deliver 33% margins through the cycle. We gave guidance for the first time in January, and then we just managed to get there pretty quickly. But we want to stay there and show that we can deliver that over a period of time. We're heading into a very -- what's going to be quite an interesting budget season for us because we've done a lot of great things this year. I know the various teams around the firm want to do great things next year. And to offset that balance, we want to be able to deliver positive operating leverage. And so, the next eight weeks and how we set up the firm for next year would inform how we communicate with you in January. But we set out those targets because we believe we could hit them. The positive is we got there earlier than we thought. And now we want to show that we can improve and maintain those margins that we've guided to previously. Robin Vince: Brian, the best clue I could give you in terms of how we think about that, it's sort of a little bit more detail is if you actually look at us on a segment-by-segment basis, you can see us prosecuting the operating leverage journey differently in our three segments. And we told you a year or so ago that, that's what we were going to do. And so, maybe to allay your concerns in terms of growth and investment, if you look at Market and Wealth Services, we aren't trying to grow the margin there. We're very happy with the margin. We just wanted to grow the total size of the business, which is exactly what we've been doing. There are -- the other segments where we said we actually do want to grow the margin towards our medium-term targets for those segments, there, we are really growing the margin. And so, you can see exactly your question at work in our segments. Brian Bedell: Yeah. That's great color. Thank you very much. Operator: And for our final question, we'll return to the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Mike Mayo: Hi. With all this talk of the transitioning of the employees, I guess, half the employees to the new platform over the next one to two years, how much do you see AI playing a role? And can you give any metrics? I mean, keeping expenses flat, I don't know how much you're still investing in AI. When Emily presented at the Boston Bank Conference last November, it seemed like BNY was all in for AI. It was one of those bullish cases made yet you've heard out in the broader world, sometimes you have hit, sometimes you have misses. So, where -- how does AI relate to the whole platform strategy? And how committed are you to AI? And do you have any numbers that you can give us, some concrete metrics? Thanks. Robin Vince: Sure. So, just to reiterate, we've got a quarter of our people in the platform's operating model. And as Dermot said, it's sort of an 18-month trajectory from here. That's really, Mike, the way I think about platform's operating model is this concept of, if you take it that we are, in fact, more and more a platforms company in terms of these large at-scale capabilities often software and services that we deliver generally in market-leading positions, number one, in a variety of different markets. We've talked about things -- the businesses before, I won't repeat them. Then, it follows to us from that it makes sense for us to operate ourselves in a platform's operating model, which is the way that many other platform companies in the world operates themselves. And so that is a strategy around how we organize ourselves in pursuing -- being pursuant to our broader strategy. Now, AI as a -- which is, of course, part of that, we have an AI hub. We have a couple of hundred people in that AI hub. And we are absolutely investing in AI and do believe in the power of AI to be able to help our business in terms of both revenue opportunities over time for clients and also ways to make our people more effective and efficient. And we haven't made a lot of noise about it, but don't misunderstand that for a lack of interest or investment because we haven't slowed down. In fact, we've increased our AI investment. And of course, notwithstanding all of that, you can see that from running the company well on an expense line, we're not allowing that enthusiasm to distract us from the important task of expense management. And this is where -- I don't mean to be pithy, but it's very, very important learning for us is that we, as a company, can walk and chew gum at the same time. We can invest in things that matter and we can manage the company well. We make choices and AI is a choice of something we're leaning into, and we think that's important for the future. Mike Mayo: Thank you. Robin Vince: Thank you. Operator: And with that, that does conclude our question-and-answer session for today. I would now like to turn the call back over to Robin for any additional or closing remarks. Robin Vince: Thank you, operator. And thanks, everyone, for your time today. We appreciate your interest in BNY. Please reach out to Marius and the IR team if you have any follow-up questions. Be well. Operator: Thank you. This does conclude today's conference and webcast. A replay of this conference call and webcast will be available on the BNY Investor Relations website at 2 o'clock pm Eastern Standard Time today. Have a great day.

Title: NN Group N.V. (AMS:NN) is largely controlled by institutional shareholders who own 54% of the company

Full Content:
Significantly high institutional ownership implies NN Group's stock price is sensitive to their trading actions The top 25 shareholders own 44% of the company Ownership research along with analyst forecasts data help provide a good understanding of opportunities in a stock To get a sense of who is truly in control of NN Group N.V. (AMS:NN), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 54% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn). Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait. Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of NN Group, beginning with the chart below. See our latest analysis for NN Group Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing. As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in NN Group. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at NN Group's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters. Investors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. NN Group is not owned by hedge funds. The company's largest shareholder is BlackRock, Inc., with ownership of 6.6%. Norges Bank Investment Management is the second largest shareholder owning 5.2% of common stock, and The Vanguard Group, Inc. holds about 4.0% of the company stock. A deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority. While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future. The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves. Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances. Our information suggests that NN Group N.V. insiders own under 1% of the company. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own €3.2m of stock. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. With a 46% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over NN Group. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run. While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Case in point: We've spotted 1 warning sign for NN Group you should be aware of. But ultimately it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.

Title: China Puts Investor Patience to Test as Key Meeting Underwhelms

(Bloomberg) — China’s highly anticipated Finance Ministry briefing on Saturday lacked the firepower that equity investors had hoped for, indicating that the volatility that’s gripped the market following a world-beating rally will likely extend. Most Read from Bloomberg Dubai’s Allure to Expats Is Weighing on City’s Infrastructure The Master Plan That Shaped Pakistan’s Capital Is No Longer Working The Cablebus Transformed Commutes in Mexico City’s Populous Outskirts As Brussels Booms, an Old Boogeyman Returns: Brusselization Chicago Marathon to Honor Kenyan Who Died After His World Record While Finance Minister Lan Fo’an promised more support for the struggling property sector and hinted at greater government borrowing to shore up the economy, the briefing didn’t produce a headline dollar figure for fresh fiscal stimulus that the markets had sought. A lack of new incentives to boost consumption, which has been a weak link in the economy, is another reason why traders may feel disappointed. The ministry “tried its best,” but there is a large gap between what was announced and what the market was expecting, said Shen Meng, a director at Beijing-based boutique investment bank Chanson & Co. “So the overall sentiment for investors is negative.” Patience has been wearing thin among investors, who have clamored for Beijing to announce big-bang fiscal measures to help sustain the rally sparked by the stimulus blitz that authorities unleashed in late September. The CSI 300 (000300.SS) Index, a benchmark of onshore equities, capped its biggest weekly loss since late July on Friday, with volatility rising ahead of the MOF briefing. The Australian and New Zealand dollars, proxies for China sentiment among developed market currencies, both slipped 0.2% in early trading Monday. A further unwinding of the rally risks fueling concern that equities are heading for yet another false dawn, which may bring more selling pressure. The market has been caught in a start-stop cycle of gains and losses a few times before as Beijing’s piecemeal approach to stimulus produced only brief rebounds. Local governments will be allowed to issue special bonds to buy unsold homes and turn them into subsidized housing, Lan and his deputies said on Saturday, while refraining from putting a price tag on any additional stimulus. Lan also hinted at room for issuing more sovereign bonds and greater government spending, steps that could be announced later this month or early November. Prior to the weekend, investors and analysts surveyed by Bloomberg had expected China to deploy as much as 2 trillion yuan ($283 billion) in fresh fiscal stimulus on Saturday, including potential subsidies, consumption vouchers and financial support for families with children. “The room for further fiscal stimulus is still on the table,” said Britney Lam, head of long-short equities for Magellan Investments Holdings Ltd. In the meantime, “markets will likely see further profit taking,” she said. Inflation data released on Sunday is likely to add to investor concerns. It showed that China’s consumer prices rose less than forecast in September, while factory-gate charges fell for a 24th straight month, underscoring the need for further policy support to help the economy break out of deflation. The CSI 300 Index slid 3.3% last week, but it’s still up 21% from its close on Sept. 23, the day before China’s central bank announced a broad package of measures that included an interest-rate cut and liquidity support for the equity market. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng China Enterprises (^HSCE) Index lost 6.6% last week after surging more than 30% in the previous three weeks. While the epic rebound in Chinese shares has spurred the likes of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and BlackRock Inc. to upgrade the market, it has also drawn skepticism from others such as Invesco Ltd. and Morgan Stanley who say stocks have already run too far too fast. “I’m still a little bit disappointed,” said Kenny Wen, head of investment strategy at KGI Asia Ltd. While the finance minister announced some specific measures, the ‘timing and amount’ were still missing. Investors will soon turn attention to the next major policy briefing in the coming weeks — from the Communist Party-controlled parliament that oversees the budget — for details of more stimulus. At its October meeting last year, the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress approved additional sovereign debt and raised the budget-deficit ratio. China’s sovereign bonds were little changed on the measures announced on Saturday. By noon on the day, the 10-year yield had erased an earlier drop of as much as two basis points, according to traders, who asked not to be identified as they are not allowed to comment publicly on the rates market. A strengthened fiscal push would likely weigh on China’s bonds by encouraging traders to move funds into riskier investments with potentially better returns. An increased supply of debt may also sap liquidity in the financial system, making it harder for the market to absorb the entire amount. The yield curve will probably move lower, given debt issuance this year may come below market consensus, said Zhaopeng Xing, a senior strategist at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group. Going forward, “we expect 1 trillion yuan of ultra-long treasury and 1 trillion yuan of local bonds to be announced,” he added. —With assistance from Abhishek Vishnoi, Zhu Lin, Wenjin Lv, Shuiyu Jing, April Ma, Matthew Burgess, Michael G.

We recently compiled a list of the 35 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX) stands against the other trending AI stocks. As the earnings season unfolds, investors are eager to see how artificial intelligence (AI) investments among S&P 500 companies are yielding results. Analysts anticipate profit growth to decelerate, with S&P 500 earnings projected to rise by 5.3% compared to the same quarter last year, down from a 13.2% increase in the second quarter, per a report by news agency Reuters.

Title: Cardano Whales Move $6 Billion In One Day, Fuel For ADA Price To Reach $0.5?

Time Published: 2024-10-12T20:30:36Z

In an interesting move, Cardano (ADA) has rebounded by almost 4% in the past 24 hours, in what seems to be an uptick in activity among large ADA holders. The price of ADA started the week on a bearish note and spent the majority of the week trending downwards. Particularly, the ADA price fell by about 9.5% to bottom out at $0.33260. However, the crypto has rebounded and has increased by about 6% from this low. This price rebound was accompanied by a large transaction volume, especially from large holders, also known as whales. According to data from IntoTheBlock (ITB), this transaction volume amounted to 17.33 billion ADA, worth about $6 billion. The Large Transaction Volume metric from IntoTheBlock tracks details on transactions with a value of $100,000 or greater. Interestingly, this metric puts the worth of whale transactions at $24.18 billion in the past seven days, a notable increase from last week’s readings. A huge part of these transactions were recorded in the past three days, with $6 billion movements coming on October 11 and $5.8 billion on October 10. The uptick in whale activity appears to be closely linked to ongoing developments within the Cardano ecosystem. According to a recent report from InputOutput, Cardano has remained a major hub for blockchain developers, especially following the recent node upgrades to v.9.2.0 and the subsequent v.9.2.1. InputOutput’s data reveals that by the end of September, there were 1,376 active projects being built on Cardano, underscoring its popularity among blockchain innovators. Additionally, during September, the number of minted native tokens grew by 80,000, while the total number of transactions on the network surged by 1.34 million. ADA’s price action has been under intense scrutiny in recent weeks, and sentiment among investors has been more negative than usual, especially on social media. Cardano’s creator, Charles Hoskinson, addressed this sentiment on social media platform X. Hoskinson clarified that the negative outlook doesn’t reflect any failure on Cardano’s part, emphasizing that the project continues to grow. He also took the opportunity to criticize other crypto ecosystems, remarking that Cardano remains one of the few cryptocurrencies still committed to being a true decentralized currency, unlike those aligning with corporate giants like BlackRock and Wall Street. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Crash: $1.83 Billion Makes Its Way To Exchanges, Is A Bloodbath Coming? Despite the pessimism, the ADA price has managed to hold a key support level at $0.33, which offers some relief to bullish investors. Additionally, on-chain metrics such as net network growth and positive momentum in the futures market suggest a more optimistic outlook. The recent uptick in whale activity could signal the beginning of a more sustained rise for the ADA price. At the time of writing, ADA is trading at $0.354. The first target is a significant break above $0.40 before a return to $0.50.

Title: Mark Harmon Explains Why His Son Isn't Returning To Play Young Gibbs On NCIS: Origins
URL: https://screenrant.com/ncis-origins-why-sean-harmon-not-returning-young-gibbs-explained-mark-harmon/
Time Published: 2024-10-12T20:01:53Z

Your changes have been saved Email is sent Email has already been sent Please verify your email address. You’ve reached your account maximum for followed topics. NCIS: Origins executive producer and narrator Mark Harmon explains why his son, Sean, isn't returning as Young Gibbs. Set to premiere on CBS in just a matter of days, NCIS: Origins is the first prequel in the history of the NCIS franchise. It follows Leroy Jethro Gibbs in the early 1990s. Although Sean Harmon is involved behind the scenes in the new show, he won't be appearing on camera. Instead, Bridge of Spies actor Austin Stowell steps into the lead role. Speaking with Variety, ahead of the premiere of NCIS: Origins on Monday, October 14, at 10 PM ET on CBS, Harmon clarified why Sean won't be reprising his role as Young Gibbs in the prequel. Even though Harmon played Gibbs in the main series, and has been credited with coming up with the pitch for NCIS: Origins, the older Harmon clarified that his son is focused on different things and enjoys executive producing. Read the quote below: He’s an actor, writer, producer, a surfer, he does a lot of things. You have to come to decisions about what you want to do in life, or what you think’s important. I just think he made a choice and had to make a decision in some ways. He likes executive producing. The new NCIS prequel puts the spotlight on Gibbs as he's just beginning his career as a Special Agent at NCIS' Camp Pendleton office. He intends to build up a gritty team, with the support of another legacy character, Mike Franks, who has been played in the main show by Muse Watson. It's a different version of Gibbs than the one the franchise viewers will recognize, at least in terms of the NCIS: Origins cast Gibbs is surrounded by. Though there are a few familiar faces, there are several more new ones, and each will develop a unique bond with the new version of Gibbs. In one of his few major acting roles, Sean Harmon appeared in seven episodes of NCIS, appearing in seasons 6, 7, 9, and 18. By bringing in Stowell, the high-profile prequel will honor NCIS continuity. But it will also signal to viewers that this is a somewhat distinct version of Gibbs that won't simply retread the ground that's been covered in flashbacks. It invites viewers in, with one argument being that audiences wouldn't necessarily have to follow the main NCIS to enjoy the prequel. NCIS: Origins recently cast its new Jethro Gibbs, and this casting is all the more exciting considering the actor’s previous action show success. In any case, even though Sean Harmon is not the lead actor, he's very much part of the show's creative team. Mark and Sean share executive producer credits alongside David J. North and Gina Lucita Monreal. The latter duo will also co-write the premiere episode and serve as showrunners, joined by those heavily involved in the main NCIS. So, while there may be a different Gibbs at the center of the story, the same writing force and vision are present. The leading cast member in the NCIS prequel is Stowell, who was recently seen in the Starz drama Three Women. But he isn't the only legacy character to board the new spinoff, considering the inclusion of Special Agent Mike Franks. In the main series, Franks functioned as a close friend and confidant to Gibbs. Portrayed by Watson, Franks appeared in 20 episodes of NCIS from 2006 to 2017. But outside of Franks, who is played in NCIS: Origins by Being Human actor Kyle Schmid, the ensemble is introducing some faces for the very first time. Mariel Molino, recently seen in the thriller series The Watchful Eye, portrays Special Agent Lala Dominguez. She is the show's female lead, with some suggestions that she could be a potential love interest for Gibbs down the line. Tyla Abercrumbie, known for playing Nina Williams on the Showtime series The Chi, has the role of Field Operation Support Officer Mary Jo Sullivan. She's described as a character who is in charge, though that might be a self-appointed role. The Blacklist's Diany Rodriguez has the role of Special Agent Vera Strickland, who appeared in one episode of the main NCIS series. Casting for the role of Vera Strickland in NCIS: Origins just created a timeline inconsistency for the NCIS franchise seven years in the making. Other actors in the core NCIS: Origins cast include Daniel Bellomy as Special Agent Granville Dawson, Caleb Martin Foote, as Special Agent Benjamin Randolf, and Robert Taylor as Jackson Gibbs, Leroy's father. They each serve different purposes in the story, with Randolf described as a golden boy. There's also Patrick Fischler as NCIS Special Agent in Charge Cliff Walker and Julian Black Antelope as Chief Medical Examiner Kai Blackrock. NCIS: Origins: Cast & Characters Actor Who They're Playing Austin Stowell Special Agent Leroy Jethro Gibbs Mariel Molino Special Agent Lala Dominguez Kyle Schmid Special Agent Mike Franks Tyla Abercrumbie Field Operation Support Officer Mary Jo Sullivan Diany Rodriguez Special Agent Vera Strickland Daniel Bellomy Special Agent Granville "Granny" Dawson Caleb Martin Foote Special Agent Benjamin “Randy” Randolf Robert Taylor Jackson Gibbs Patrick Fischler NCIS Special Agent in Charge Cliff Walker Julian Black Antelope Chief Medical Examiner Kai Blackrock Lori Petty Dr. Lenora Friedman Bobby Moynihan Woodrow “Woody” Browne Mark Harmon Special Agent Leroy Jethro Gibbs (as narrator) Two additions that were announced late to the prequel were Lori Petty and SNL alum Bobby Moynihan. They play a pathologist and the Director of the NIS Forensic Lab, respectively. It all adds up to a somewhat different take on Gibbs' past, which makes the change from Sean Harmon to Stowell more understandable. Even though the reasons are only implied by Harmon, it takes a lot to be the lead of a high-profile series. That's both in terms of the work itself and hours filming, but also things like promotional tours and being the face of the brand. All of this might have contributed to CBS and Sean Harmon wanting to go in a different direction. But it also allows NCIS: Origins a better chance of standing on its own terms. Source: Variety Your comment has not been saved A young Gibbs embarks on his journey as a Naval Investigative Service agent in the early 1990s. Set against the backdrop of Camp Pendleton, the series explores Gibbs' formative years, the cases that shaped him, and the mentors who guided his path, including Mike Franks.

Share your opinions in the thread below and remember to keep it respectful. Your comment has not been saved Finally!!! I’ve been anxiously awaiting this show since its announcement back in January. I hope it lives up to expectations- I’m betting it will! The story continues......no how the story, the legend, the reputation became as respected as He is. Looking forward to the development of how the GIBBS RULES came into being..... especially rules 9 and 12 I have watched every episode on NCIS since the beginning. Can't wait until tomorrow to start watching the new series. Best wishes for a successful Show Arnold Sheir Mark Harmon returns as Leroy Jethro Gibbs in the NCIS: Origins premiere, but his appearance keeps where he is and who may be talking to vague. Reacher seasons 2 and 3 had a similar opening arc, and, from the looks of it, the Amazon show's third season will also continue the narrative trend. Although Henry Cavill has never actually played James Bond, three of his movies from the last decade serve as an unofficial 007 trilogy. Writer Josh Williamson tells Screen Rant he's planning to stay on the new G.I. Joe series for a long time, promising big stories in the years to come. Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children underwhelmed on release but remains one of Tim Burton's most underappreciated projects. Exclusive: Nolan North, who voices Conner Kent, a.k.a. Superboy on the DC show, offers a positive update on a potential Young Justice season 5. The premiere of the second season of Justin Hartley’s Tracker show set up a bigger heartbreak for Colter’s team than previously imagined.

UBS recently raised the price target on the stock to $307 from $230 and kept a Buy rating on the shares. The advisory highlighted that Constellation had announced a contract with Microsoft to provide long-term, dedicated power from the restarted Crane plant, and the broad implications from the announcement are a reaffirmation of the demand for power from large technology companies and the willingness to pay up for access to large quantities of clean energy. Per the advisory, this is another signaling event in the power demand thesis that demonstrates a very supportive fundamental backdrop for power. Overall CEG ranks 21st on our list of the trending AI stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of CEG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Title: Troubled retailers face a Halloween crunch with consumers spending less
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/troubled-retailers-face-halloween-crunch-190000616.html
Time Published: 2024-10-12T19:00:00Z

(Bloomberg) -- A predicted slide in Halloween consumption is the latest blow for heavily-indebted retailers battling mounting overheads and the trend of consumers trading down to cheaper products. Most Read from Bloomberg Dubai’s Allure to Expats Is Weighing on City’s Infrastructure The Master Plan That Shaped Pakistan’s Capital Is No Longer Working The Cablebus Transformed Commutes in Mexico City’s Populous Outskirts As Brussels Booms, an Old Boogeyman Returns: Brusselization Chicago Marathon to Honor Kenyan Who Died After His World Record US spending for the holiday will drop by 5% to $11.6 billion this year, according to the National Retail Federation. Sales of greeting cards and costumes are likely to see the greatest decline, a hit to merchants reliant on seasonal splurges in what’s already been a tough year for the industry. Households on the lower end of the income scale are broadly struggling as unemployment has edged higher this year and underlying inflation has remained persistently high. Retailer Michaels Cos. said on a recent earnings call that households earning less than $100,000 are retrenching, resulting in lower basket sizes. “2024 has been a perfect storm for retailers of all stripes,” said Erica Weisgerber, a partner at law firm Debevoise & Plimpton LLP. “Inflation, high operational costs, and reduced consumer spending have been especially challenging for brick-and-mortar retailers, and online retailers have struggled with steep competition from e-commerce giants like Amazon.” Many of the troubled firms, including Michaels and At Home Group Inc., are owned by private equity managers after buyouts during the pandemic proved ill-timed when interest rates rose and inflation crimped household budgets. Home, clothing and hobby retailers dominate the list of distressed retailers because the size of their debt means they lack the liquidity to compete with better capitalized competitors, according to Moody’s Ratings. Still, Michaels and At Home are hopeful that they can win a larger slice of the holiday spending. Hellman & Friedman LLC’s At Home saw a strong start to Halloween spending after flat second-quarter net sales of about $443 million, chief financial officer Jerry Murray said on a September earnings call. Apollo Global Management Inc.’s Michaels also saw a revenue pop tied to Halloween as customers began to buy inventory earlier this year, according to people on last month’s earnings call. That’s a fillip for the firm whose earnings declined by about 20% to $50 million in the second quarter from a year earlier, the people said, asking not to be identified as the information is private. Apollo and Hellman & Friedman declined to comment. The pullback is creating challenges for the wider industry and has contributed to several high-profile bankruptcies this year, including Joann Inc., Big Lots Inc. and Conn’s Inc. It also makes it harder to turn around firms simply by slashing costs. “Retailers are finding that their low-hanging efficiency efforts do not go far enough,” said Holly Etlin, a partner in AlixPartners’ turnaround practice. With capital markets shunning troubled firms, more retailers turned to bankruptcy rather than distressed exchanges over the past year as the companies require deeper restructuring that is best done in court, Moody’s Ratings said in a report last month. It’s part of a wider trend that saw quarterly filings for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection rise to the highest level since 2012 in the three months through June. Private equity’s widespread failure to hedge against rising borrowing costs also means it’s less able to come to the rescue of troubled firms, which could have knock-on effects for the economy and jobs. “The private equity players that often have backstopped retailers have been in a new deal lull as multiples collapsed and rates for leveraged deals skyrocketed,” said James Gellert, executive chair at risk analytics provider RapidRatings International Inc. Listen here to the Credit Edge podcast on Schroders’ bullish outlook on CRE private debt Week in Review China’s onshore high-yield debt market this week suffered its worst day of trading in years as investors pulled money out of bonds and poured it into stocks in response to government stimulus. Meanwhile, domestic developer Country Garden Holdings Co. missed a self-imposed target date for getting key creditor support for terms of its restructuring plan. Inflows to private credit funds helped BlackRock Inc. pull in a record $221 billion of total client cash last quarter, bringing the world’s largest money manager to an all-time high of $11.5 trillion of assets. A potential bidding war for HPS Investment Partners is set to swell the fortunes of its three founders as rival groups vie for a piece of the red-hot private credit market. A group of private credit firms including 26North Partners are closing in on a deal to lend to Vista Equity Partners-backed Alegeus Technologies, after the software firm tried to refinance existing debt with a new leveraged loan. Banks led by UBS Group AG sold $1 billion of leveraged loans to help finance Vista Equity Partners’ buyout of software company Jaggaer, the market’s latest acquisition deal to include a second-lien component. In Europe, Blackstone Inc. is investing in a C$1.125 billion ($822 million) second-lien tranche that is helping finance AutoScout24’s purchase of Canadian online car marketplace Trader. K2 Insurance Services sold a bigger-than-planned leveraged loan as the firm cuts borrowing costs on buyout-related financing by three percentage points. Verizon Communications Inc. lined up $10 billion of short-term bank funding to help finance its purchase of Frontier Communications Parent Inc. If cut to junk status, Boeing Co. will be the biggest US corporate borrower to ever be stripped of its investment-grade ratings and join junk bond indexes, flooding the high-yield market with a record volume of new debt to absorb. A market for aircraft bonds that all but shut down after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is showing signs of life again. Japan’s Norinchukin Bank got a vote of confidence from bond investors on Wednesday, when spreads on the firm’s first dollar issuance since it revealed massive losses tightened significantly in secondary trading. Gritstone Bio Inc., a vaccine developer that once touted its ability to make a next-generation Covid-19 shot, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in Delaware. Avante Health Solutions filed for bankruptcy in order to sell its business to an affiliate of private equity firm Staple Street Capital. On the Move John Abate, partner and co-head of trading at Silver Point Capital, is set to retire by the end of the year after more than 15 years at the hedge fund. Wells Fargo & Co. is hiring Celine Catherin from Deutsche Bank AG as a managing director and co-head of its leveraged syndicate. Joshua Baumgarten, co-managing partner and head of credit at TPG Angelo Gordon, is leaving the firm after its purchase last year by TPG Inc. JPMorgan Chase & Co. has hired Mike Shanahan from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. as a managing director in its technology leveraged finance team. Corinthia Global Management has recruited three more people from Barings after poaching a 22-strong team from the US asset manager earlier this year. The trio are Louis Godest, Christel Huguet and Jan Lübke. JPMorgan Chase & Co. veteran Doug Kravitz joined M3 Partners as a managing director focused on advising company creditors in restructuring scenarios.

New reports have revealed that BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager and American multinational investment company, is now selling Bitcoin (BTC) to buy Ethereum (ETH). Many market watchers propose that this unexpected investment change could trigger a bullish rally for Ethereum, potentially catalyzing another altcoin season. Lookonchain, a blockchain analytics tool has uncovered a shocking new transaction executed by asset manager, BlackRock. In its official X (formerly Twitter) account, Lookonchain disclosed that BlackRock has recently sold off 182 BTC, valued at $11.34 million. Around the same period, the blockchain analytics tool recorded BlackRock purchasing 7,574 ETH tokens, worth approximately $18.52 million. This surprising development indicates a potential shift in BlackRock’s investment strategy, hinting at the investment giant’s newfound favor in Ethereum. As the world’s largest Bitcoin fund, BlackRock’s decision to dump Bitcoin for Ethereum comes as a shock to many crypto community members, with discussions flooding the space about the real reason behind the asset manager’s investment decision. According to some market watchers, BlackRock’s move is a reflection of its clients’ digital asset preferences, as the asset manager could be selling Bitcoin and buying Ethereum based on client requests. Other crypto community members are seeing BlackRock’s investment move as a sign that the price of Ethereum could be gearing up for a substantial rally. As the number one altcoin in the market with the largest market capitalization, a massive price rally for Ethereum could potentially trigger the long-awaited altcoin season. Historically, a price increase in Ethereum paves the way for other altcoins in the market to see similarly bullish gains. With the market already expecting a significant altcoin season in this bull cycle, BlackRock’s unexpected investment move is fueling speculation in the market about a potential Ethereum price surge that could outperform Bitcoin. As of writing, BlackRock‘s holding reveals a strong preference for Bitcoin in terms of value. Data from Lookonchain reveals that BlackRock holds approximately 369,640 BTC, valued at an impressive $23.02 billion. In comparison, the investment giant Ethereum’s holdings amount to 414,168 ETH, with a value of around $1.01 billion, highlighting a stark difference in the allocation between the two leading cryptocurrencies. Numerous analysts in the crypto market are expressing optimism about the highly anticipated altcoin season. A popular Bitcoin and crypto analyst identified as ‘Moustache’ on X has disclosed that the altcoins season index has been forming a particularly bullish pattern for the past 3.5 years, suggesting that altcoins could be on the verge of a significant price increase. He disclosed that this technical analysis pattern is known as the “Inverse Head and Shoulder,” which often indicates a potential shift from a downtrend to an uptrend. The analyst is optimistic that the present market downturn will soon be replaced by strong growth in the altcoin market, anticipating an extended period of price gains.
