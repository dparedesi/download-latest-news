BlackRock Inc.’s India venture with billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s group expects the nearly $900 billion local mutual fund industry to expand up to threefold over the next seven years, fueled by record inflows from domestic investors and a robust economy. Participation in Indian financial markets is starting to increase rapidly, much of that driven by digital platforms, according to Sid Swaminathan, chief executive officer of Jio BlackRock Asset Management, an equal alliance between Ambani’s Jio Financial Services Ltd. and the world’s largest asset manager. Asia’s richest man is seeking to reshape India’s financial services industry by leveraging his vast telecom and retail empire. For BlackRock, the tie-up marks a return to money management in the world’s fastest-growing major economy after its exit in 2018. The move coincides with a shift in household savings — once tied-up in gold and property — toward financial markets. The change has fueled an explosive growth in the domestic mutual fund sector, with assets more than doubling over the past five years. “Being in India at this point in its economic journey, there are so many tailwinds in our favor,” Swaminathan, who joined the venture after a 20-year stint with BlackRock in London, told Bloomberg News in an interview. India’s equity markets have more than doubled to $5.3 trillion over the last five years, drawing millions of retail investors. But Jio BlackRock faces stiff competition from entrenched fund houses backed by major lenders such as HDFC Bank Ltd., ICICI Bank Ltd. and State Bank of India, which command big distribution networks that reach small towns and villages. Online investment platforms such as Groww and Zerodha are also fueling the boom in direct mutual fund sales. Investor appetite, however, has been strong. The Jio BlackRock venture raised more than $2 billion in just three days for its debut funds in July, placing the alliance among the top 15 managers in that category. “For us to be operating in the next five years as a player of scale, it has to be about growing the market, rather than just capture market share from existing players,” Swaminathan said. That aim is shaping the asset manager’s approach: It is preparing a mix of passive and active strategies, with its first active equity fund set to launch next week. The product will draw on nearly 400 indicators on about 1,000 Indian stocks, building a portfolio broader than is typical for the category. In addition, it plans to launch a fund that rotates between sectors based on quantitative signals and is considering another one that systematically allocates between asset classes, Swaminathan said. The partnership hired Rishi Kohli, who headed hedge fund quantitative strategies at InCred Capital and Avendus, as its chief investment officer. The room for growth in systematic strategies is large in India, given the low starting point, Swaminathan said, describing the data-driven approach that also incorporates human judgment. As the market matures with more stocks and greater industry diversity, it becomes more conducive to such strategies, he said. The venture plans to use alternative data, from web-search activity to retail sentiment on online forums, and evaluate auditor quality when ranking firms. The Jio BlackRock partnership, spanning asset management, wealth management and equity broking, is pursuing a direct-to-consumer strategy via its app, bypassing traditional brokers and distributors. A sharp market decline could slow the sector’s expansion. Indian equities have significantly underperformed emerging-market peers in the past year, partly due to weak earnings growth and stretched valuations. Yet retail flows remain resilient, with monthly systematic investment plans topping $3 billion in August even as foreign funds retreated.

The visit comes as the UK and US prepare to sign a landmark technology agreement aimed at boosting cooperation between the two countries. By Caolán Magee and PA Share Save United States President Donald Trump has arrived in the United Kingdom for his second state visit, describing it as a “great honour” to be hosted by King Charles III at Windsor Castle. The US president landed at the London Stansted airport on Tuesday evening, where new UK Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper was among those greeting him as he stepped off Air Force One. Trump, accompanied by First Lady Melania Trump, is expected to stay overnight at Winfield House, the official residence of the US ambassador in Regent’s Park, before travelling to Windsor Castle on Wednesday for a ceremonial welcome and a state banquet. Thousands are expected to protest during his stay, though he has no public-facing engagements planned. Speaking to reporters before landing, Trump said: “My relationship is very good with the UK, and Charles, as you know, who’s now King, is my friend. It’s the first time this has ever happened where somebody was honoured twice. So, it’s a great honour.” The visit comes as the UK and US prepare to sign a landmark technology agreement aimed at boosting cooperation between the two countries’ multi-trillion-dollar tech sectors. Trump is expected to be joined by a delegation of US executives, including Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang and OpenAI’s Sam Altman, Reuters reported. Meanwhile, Sky News reported that BlackRock plans to invest $700m in British data centres as part of a series of announcements tied to the state visit. The UK was the first country to sign a bilateral trade agreement with the Trump administration in May. Under that deal, Washington pledged to reduce tariffs on aluminium and steel from 25 percent to zero, though the changes have yet to take effect. Trump has hinted at possible tariff relief for UK steel ahead of talks with Prime Minister Keir Starmer at Chequers, the prime minister’s country residence, on Thursday. “I’m there also on trade. They want to see if they can refine the trade deal a little bit. We’ve made a deal, and it’s a great deal, and I’m into helping them,” Trump said. Follow Al Jazeera English:

Funding another buyback push, SharpLink's Ethereum balance sheet swells to $3.86 billion, enticing long-term growth strategies. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Shares of SharpLink Gaming fell slightly even as the Ethereum treasury firm pressed forward with its ambitious stock repurchase program, buying another 1 million shares. The company, which trades under the ticker SBET, said the latest purchases were executed at an average price of $16.67 each. Despite the move, SharpLink’s stock slipped 2.8% to $16.32 by late afternoon in New York. The buybacks are part of a $1.5 billion authorization approved in August. To date, the firm has retired nearly 1.93 million shares for about $32 million, funding the purchases with cash reserves, staking income, and other financing rather than debt. Alongside the buybacks, SharpLink continued to build its Ethereum balance sheet. The firm reported holding 838,152 ETH as of Sept. 16, up from 740,760 tokens a month earlier, with a total value of about $3.86 billion. The figure includes 3,240 ETH earned through staking since June. The company, backed by Ethereum developer Consensys, is the second-largest corporate holder of ETH after Bitmine Immersion, which controls more than 2 million tokens. Together, the two firms account for the majority of Ethereum kept on the books by the roughly 70 public digital asset treasury companies that own at least 100 ETH each. SharpLink said it will only repurchase shares when its net asset value (NAV) falls below 1 — a level it considers a signal that the stock is undervalued compared with its crypto holdings. As of Sept. 15, SBET’s NAV stood at 0.91x, meaning the market was valuing its shares at about 9% below its ether reserves. Buybacks have become increasingly common among digital asset treasuries, though they remain controversial. Critics say they risk prioritizing short-term price support, while SharpLink CEO Joseph Chalom, a former BlackRock executive, argues the program is “immediately accretive” and strengthens long-term shareholder returns. SharpLink shares surged earlier this year after announcing a partnership with Consensys, briefly topping $78 in June, but have since pulled back. The company said it remains committed to aligning shareholder value with Ethereum’s growth, underscoring its strategy of using token accumulation and selective buybacks to “buy low and sell high.” AJ, a passionate journalist since Yemen's 2011 Arab Spring, has honed his skills worldwide for over a decade.

Title: Trump Postpones TikTok Ban Enforcement for Fourth Time as He Claims ‘We Have a Deal’ With China to Sell App’s U.S. Operations to ‘Very Big Companies’
URL: https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/tikotok-ban-trump-postpones-enforcement-deal-app-1236520948/
Time Published: 2025-09-16T20:11:44Z

Consortium including Oracle, Silver Lake and Andreessen Horowitz would own 80% of TikTok U.S., WSJ reports By Todd Spangler NY Digital Editor TikTok U.S. is poised to get a new ownership structure — and a new app for American users — if the Trump administration’s much-delayed efforts to ink a deal to comply with a federal law banning Chinese control of the app go through. President Donald Trump, speaking with reporters Tuesday outside the White House, said, “We’ve got a deal on TikTok. I’ve reached a deal with China.” He said there are “very big companies that want to buy it.” Trump said he is going to speak with Chinese president Xi Jinping on Friday “to confirm everything.” Related Stories Michael Keaton Says the ‘Irony’ That Charlie Kirk Was ‘Killed With a Gun Is Unbelievable’: ‘Shooting People Will Never Answer Anything’ Since the deal isn’t final yet, Trump is again postponing his administration’s enforcement of the TikTok divest-or-ban bill — the fourth time he’s done so — pushing the deadline out 90 days, from Sept. 17 to Dec. 16. Popular on Variety Trump did not provide details on TikTok U.S.’s potential new owners. According to a Wall Street Journal report, TikTok’s U.S. business would be 80% owned and controlled by an investor consortium including Oracle, Silver Lake and Andreessen Horowitz. In addition, current ByteDance investors including Susquehanna International, KKR and General Atlantic, would be part of the 80% ownership group. Chinese shareholders including ByteDance would own the remainder, according to the Journal report, which cited anonymous sources. The new TikTok U.S. company would have a U.S.-dominated board that includes a member designated by the U.S. government, per the WSJ report. U.S. and Chinese officials met for trade talks Monday in Madrid, where China’s top trade negotiator, Li Chenggang, told reporters the two sides had reached a “basic framework consensus” for a deal to keep TikTok available in the U.S., according to a Reuters report. Reps for TikTok and ByteDance did not respond to requests for comment. Under a U.S. law that went into effect Jan. 19, 2025, it is illegal for American companies to host or distribute TikTok in the country as long as it remains controlled by Chinese parent company ByteDance. The legislation passed last year with overwhelming bipartisan support in Congress, on fears that the popular video entertainment app’s ties to China‘s communist regime make it a national security risk. It was signed into law by President Biden. The Trump administration has been trying to reach a deal to restructure TikTok U.S.’s ownership in a way that complies with the law while also being an arrangement that will be acceptable to the Chinese government. ByteDance has said 60% of its ownership is represented by global institutional investors including BlackRock, General Atlantic and Susquehanna, with 20% owned by its Chinese founders and 20% by employees including those in the United States. The U.S. divest-or-ban law prohibits distribution of any app in which companies or individuals located in a country that is a “foreign adversary” to the United States “directly or indirectly own” at least a 20% stake. The transfer of ownership would result in TikTok’s current U.S. users having to download and install a new app, which will be wholly separate from the app as it exists in the rest of the world, per the Journal. The U.S. version of the app will have a content-recommendation algorithm that uses technology licensed from ByteDance, while Oracle will continue to manage and host TikTok’s U.S. data. Trump, in the final months of his first administration, tried unsuccessfully to ban TikTok unless its ownership was transferred to U.S. companies. But after the 2024 election Trump said “I have a warm spot in my heart for TikTok,” because “there are those who say” the app helped drive support for him among young voters.

Full Content:
(Bloomberg) -- Goldman Sachs Group Inc’s co-chief for the Middle East and North Africa and one of its top asset-management executives is set to leave the bank. Fadi Abuali is departing the New York-based firm after almost 28 years with the company, according to an internal memo. A Goldman spokesperson confirmed the contents of the memo. Abuali was instrumental in expanding Goldman’s franchise in the Middle Eastern and North Africa since he was appointed co-CEO for the region alongside Zaid Khaldi almost five years ago. The bank opened an office in Abu Dhabi in 2023 and last year became the first Wall Street lender to secure a so-called regional headquarters license in Saudi Arabia. Earlier this year, Saudi Arabia’s sovereign-wealth fund agreed to anchor Goldman’s new private-credit and public-equity strategies in Saudi Arabia and the wider Gulf. As part of the bank’s push into Middle Eastern private credit, it is relocating London-based executive Deb Dutt to the region, Abuali said in a recent interview. Goldman asset managers in the Middle East have been in high demand, with Khalid Albdah, head of Goldman in Saudi Arabia and co-head of the regional asset-management arm, leaving late last year for Neuberger Berman. Earlier in 2024, BlackRock Inc. tapped Mohammad Al Fahim, who oversaw Goldman’s Abu Dhabi branch, to head its operations in the United Arab Emirates. Aside from the Middle East and North Africa, Abuali also jointly ran Goldman Asset Management’s international arm, serving as a key lieutenant to Marc Nachmann, global head of the bank’s asset- and wealth-management business, and was global co-head of the asset-management institutional-client business.

Dundalk FC – 12 months on from almost going out of business September 16, 2024, Dundalk supporters gather outside Oriel Park in Dundalk, Louth. Photo by Ben McShane/Sportsfile Former CEO Peter Halpin says it is “quite shocking” to think back at how close Dundalk FC came to going out of existence 12 months ago. The Blackrock man, who vacated his role at Oriel Park in February to concentrate on his own business, Halpin Sport Sponsorship, was at the heart of frantic phone calls this time last year to keep the doors open after Brian Ainscough threatened to liquidate the debt-ridden club.

Title: Mitsotakis: Reliable and costed fiscal policy is a fundamental principle

The impressive growth dynamics of the Greek economy were mentioned, among others, by the Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, who participated today in a discussion with BlackRock Vice President Philip Hildebrand and Adebayo Ogunlezi, chairman and CEO of Global Infrastructure Partners, at the Athens International Investors Summit investment conference, organised by Yperat Fund and BlackRock. He stressed that the fundamental principle is a reliable and cost-effective fiscal policy so that fiscal and macroeconomic stability is not questioned, that the benefits from the fight against tax evasion are returned to citizens, while he also highlighted the importance of defense, which he called the supreme European public good. The Prime Minister also had the opportunity to address, before powerful investment players with broad portfolios, the country’s prospects, investment opportunities, and challenges in several sectors, and the issues of green transition and energy. During the forum, the establishment of the Hellenic Innovation & Infrastructure Fund, which is the investment arm of the Super Fund, was announced. “We are growing at a much higher rate than the eurozone average, while at the same time reducing taxes, focusing on private investment, promoting entrepreneurship and improving the business environment,” the prime minister said during his remarks. “We have achieved all this in an environment of political stability. We have a government with an absolute majority. In 2023, the citizens rewarded us by giving us a new mandate. I think this sets us apart from many other European countries, because coalition politics can be very complicated,” Kyriakos Mitsotakis continued. “I think the big challenge, from a political point of view, is to link the macroeconomic situation to everyday life and work, in an environment where the cost of living has become a big problem,” the prime minister stressed. “I think there is a general understanding that this page turn is here to stay. My job is to ensure that the changes we have implemented are irreversible. That’s my commitment to the investment community and, frankly, the main reason why I want to seek a third term. To ensure that what we have achieved continues and that the wealth we are creating for the country is maintained. My first commitment in 2023 was to raise wages. When I see unemployment falling from 18% to 8%, that means that real wages are rising, Kyriakos Mitsotakis noted. “This is the only way to truly distribute wealth,” he added. Referring to the importance of reliable and cost-effective fiscal policy, the prime minister noted: “The fundamental principle of our approach has always been not to question the pursuit of fiscal and macroeconomic stability. The 2009-2010 crisis was a consequence of the spending derailment and our failure to focus on fundamentally restructuring our economy. We will not repeat the same mistake, ever. That is why our commitment to generate primary surpluses and, whenever possible, fiscal surpluses, will not be challenged.” The Prime Minister also stressed that the benefits of the fight against tax evasion are returned to citizens through systematic tax cuts, with an emphasis on middle incomes, young people and families with children. “The biggest reform that has contributed to the state budget has been our ability to address the problem of tax evasion. This brought a lot of money into the public coffers, which we now have to return to the citizens. So we reduced taxes for the middle class. We have reduced taxes for families with children. We have reduced income tax to zero for those under 25 years of age. I want to encourage young people to join the workforce; I don’t want them to wait years. I respect young kids who go to technical school and enter the workforce at age 20. I want them to know that we are thinking about them,” he said. During the debate on the future of European defence, given the current geopolitical landscape, the prime minister said: “We will need to mobilise not only private but also public funds. We will need to mobilise European public resources for defence. I have been clear on this issue; I have spoken about it on many occasions. The recent incursion of Russian drones into Polish airspace has brought to the fore something that we already know is a major problem, and that concerns missile defence and air defence systems in Europe. Therefore, my proposal is very clear: a pan-European tool for what I consider to be a pan-European good. And defence is the ultimate European public good. We cannot allow our national priorities to become an obstacle to tackling what is essentially an existential threat to Europe. Can this happen? The answer is that I see much greater potential. Some of the traditionally ‘frugal’ countries, such as Denmark and Finland, are much more open to the idea of joint European defence borrowing.” Kyriakos Mitsotakis also addressed, among other things, the issue of green transition and energy. “Greece has been extremely successful in adding renewable energy sources, both solar and wind, to our energy mix. We produce more than 50% of our electricity from renewable sources. Especially in spring or autumn, we have the possibility of having all our electricity generated for hours from renewable sources. For the first time this summer, we have also seen greater price convergence between Western, Central, and South-Eastern Europe,” the Prime Minister said. “We need more interconnections. We have become net exporters of electricity. This has never happened before. But, of course, we will need additional investments in baseload – in the case of Greece, we are talking about natural gas – and of course, investments in storage. This is the plan as to how we intend to proceed with the green transition in a realistic way, but also taking into account that for us, renewable energy sources constitute an important comparative advantage,” he added.

Bengaluru: Snapdeal, run by AceVector, is relying on strong growth in fashion and apparel to strengthen its position in the competitive e-commerce space, especially during the high-stakes festive season when customer loyalty is low. According to CEO Achint Setia, the company has seen its fashion and lifestyle categories triple in growth this year, though exact figures remain undisclosed. Bengaluru: Snapdeal, run by AceVector, is relying on strong growth in fashion and apparel to strengthen its position in the competitive e-commerce space, especially during the high-stakes festive season when customer loyalty is low. According to CEO Achint Setia, the company has seen its fashion and lifestyle categories triple in growth this year, though exact figures remain undisclosed. “Fashion has been a standout category this year and, in fact, has been possibly the fastest-growing one so far. Overall, lifestyle [including fashion, home decor, and kitchen] already accounts for 90% of our business today, and fashion is a major driving force," Setia told Mint in an interview. Setia was appointed to the role in January, replacing Himanshu Chakrawarti, who led Snapdeal and its subsidiary Stellaro Brands for three years. Setia has over two decades of experience across marketing and strategy roles in firms like Myntra, Viacom18 Media, and Zalora Group. Also Read | Snapdeal is at the threshold of an IPO While the festival season is a key period for all consumer-facing brands and platforms, this year is particularly crucial for Snapdeal parent AceVector as it is currently waiting for the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) clearance to list in the public markets. “Approval from Sebi before the end of the financial year is crucial for Snapdeal parent AceVector. If they don't get it, or if they have to refile, they'll need to update their IPO documents with a full year of financial data. This means the festive season performance will be key in shaping investor sentiment, especially in a volatile market," said a senior e-commerce executive, asking not to be named. Key Takeaways Snapdeal parent AceVector's IPO hinges on festival season performance and small-town fashion demand. Fashion and lifestyle now account for 90% of Snapdeal’s business, with value pricing as a core strategy. Meesho, Flipkart, and Amazon dominate the same geographies Snapdeal targets. Snapdeal is avoiding quick commerce, focusing instead on improving delivery speed within its current model. Experts remain unconvinced of Snapdeal’s differentiation or growth potential in a crowded market. AceVector filed its draft papers for an IPO reportedly to raise ₹500 crore through the confidential route in July, which allows it to withhold public disclosure of IPO details until later stages. Setia declined to comment on the progress of the filing. Despite its early entry, Snapdeal is yet to make a mark among the top e-commerce players in the country by both market share and volume of transactions. For context, industry estimates show Flipkart as the market leader with 48% share, followed by Meesho and Amazon. The Indian e-commerce market is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 21% and reach $325 billion in 2030, as per an October 2024 report by Deloitte. Long way to goFounded in 2010 by Kunal Bahl and Rohit Bansal, Snapdeal was initially launched as a daily deals platform and later pivoted to a full-fledged marketplace in 2011. Over the years, it raised more than $1.8 billion in funding from SoftBank, Alibaba Group, Foxconn and BlackRock, among others. However, intense competition and the absence of a distinct growth strategy have gradually eroded Snapdeal’s momentum in the e-commerce space. Snapdeal largely caters to cities outside metropolitan areas where value retail has picked up in recent years. Within this, fashion remains the top growth driver—with more than 80% of orders placed priced below ₹599 and 80% of them coming from small town India, according to CEO Setia. “For us, it’s about the value-conscious mindset that could be sitting out of anywhere," he noted. Over the last few months, Snapdeal has invested substantially in in-house festive campaigns, as well as technology and tools for returns forecasting and logistics. According to Setia, it has also expanded its seller portfolio, adding more from key clusters like Tirupur, Surat, Ludhiana, and Agra. According to a September 2024 report by market research firm Centrum, the mass-market fashion segment accounts for 56% of India’s total apparel market. However, offline continues to account for more than half the sales, with Tata’s Trent, D-Mart, and Vishal Mega Mart offering a sufficient selection of price-conscious consumers in smaller towns. While small-town India offers a wide online shopping-savvy market waiting to be captured, Meesho has raced past Snapdeal in those geographies, especially in value commerce. “For a very long time, Snapdeal has been positioned as an e-commerce platform for Bharat, but it doesn’t necessarily hold a strong position. Meesho, Flipkart and Amazon have expanded their presence in these markets over the years, which means competition is so much more now," said Devangshu Dutta, founder and chief executive officer at consulting firm Third Eyesight. Also Read | Meesho posts maiden profit in July, weighs IPO in 12-18 months Moreover, the lack of loyalty in the value retail segment makes customer acquisition and retention costlier as ticket sizes are small and supply is crowded and fragmented, according to Ashutosh Sharma, vice president and research director at Forrester. “Snapdeal is trying hard to revive its brand. We don’t see it having a lot of market share or path to rapid growth in a crowded market unless they somehow differentiate or pivot to some other innovative approach, in a highly value-conscious market," Sharma added. Under stress, Snapdeal has made several attempts to revive its position. In 2016, it spent as much as ₹200 crore to rebrand and create a new brand identity, but very little changed. In FY24, Snapdeal’s revenue was flat at ₹379.6 crore, while losses narrowed nearly 43% to ₹160 crore, aided by lower expenses. Quick commerceWhile the e-commerce market gradually shifts to faster deliveries, Snapdeal remains unfazed. The firm will not look to enter the quick commerce race, stating that a market for all kinds of online commerce exists. “We are continuously exploring what our customers want. But at this point, we are focused on our current model while trying to improve delivery speed and experience. A lot of our orders are already delivered the next day. Having said that, quick commerce isn’t a priority because the inventory stock model is a different ballgame," said Snapdeal’s Setia.

Quick commerce also has very different infrastructure and capability demands." “Approval from Sebi before the end of the financial year is crucial for Snapdeal parent AceVector. If they don't get it, or if they have to refile, they'll need to update their IPO documents with a full year of financial data. This means the festive season performance will be key in shaping investor sentiment, especially in a volatile market," said a senior e-commerce executive, asking not to be named. AceVector filed its draft papers for an IPO reportedly to raise ₹500 crore through the confidential route in July, which allows it to withhold public disclosure of IPO details until later stages. Setia declined to comment on the progress of the filing. Despite its early entry, Snapdeal is yet to make a mark among the top e-commerce players in the country by both market share and volume of transactions. For context, industry estimates show Flipkart as the market leader with 48% share, followed by Meesho and Amazon. The Indian e-commerce market is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 21% and reach $325 billion in 2030, as per an October 2024 report by Deloitte. Long way to goFounded in 2010 by Kunal Bahl and Rohit Bansal, Snapdeal was initially launched as a daily deals platform and later pivoted to a full-fledged marketplace in 2011. Over the years, it raised more than $1.8 billion in funding from SoftBank, Alibaba Group, Foxconn and BlackRock, among others. However, intense competition and the absence of a distinct growth strategy have gradually eroded Snapdeal’s momentum in the e-commerce space. Snapdeal largely caters to cities outside metropolitan areas where value retail has picked up in recent years. Within this, fashion remains the top growth driver—with more than 80% of orders placed priced below ₹599 and 80% of them coming from small town India, according to CEO Setia. “For us, it’s about the value-conscious mindset that could be sitting out of anywhere," he noted. Over the last few months, Snapdeal has invested substantially in in-house festive campaigns, as well as technology and tools for returns forecasting and logistics. According to Setia, it has also expanded its seller portfolio, adding more from key clusters like Tirupur, Surat, Ludhiana, and Agra. According to a September 2024 report by market research firm Centrum, the mass-market fashion segment accounts for 56% of India’s total apparel market. However, offline continues to account for more than half the sales, with Tata’s Trent, D-Mart, and Vishal Mega Mart offering a sufficient selection of price-conscious consumers in smaller towns. While small-town India offers a wide online shopping-savvy market waiting to be captured, Meesho has raced past Snapdeal in those geographies, especially in value commerce. “For a very long time, Snapdeal has been positioned as an e-commerce platform for Bharat, but it doesn’t necessarily hold a strong position. Meesho, Flipkart and Amazon have expanded their presence in these markets over the years, which means competition is so much more now," said Devangshu Dutta, founder and chief executive officer at consulting firm Third Eyesight.

We don’t see it having a lot of market share or path to rapid growth in a crowded market unless they somehow differentiate or pivot to some other innovative approach, in a highly value-conscious market," Sharma added. Under stress, Snapdeal has made several attempts to revive its position. In 2016, it spent as much as ₹200 crore to rebrand and create a new brand identity, but very little changed. In FY24, Snapdeal’s revenue was flat at ₹379.6 crore, while losses narrowed nearly 43% to ₹160 crore, aided by lower expenses. Quick commerceWhile the e-commerce market gradually shifts to faster deliveries, Snapdeal remains unfazed. The firm will not look to enter the quick commerce race, stating that a market for all kinds of online commerce exists. “We are continuously exploring what our customers want. But at this point, we are focused on our current model while trying to improve delivery speed and experience. A lot of our orders are already delivered the next day.

Title: Hyperliquid Turns Up The HYPE —And The Heat On Circle’s USDC

ByJon Helgi Egilsson, Contributor. HYPE, the governance token of Hyperliquid—a decentralized trading platform—has surged more than 1,500% in less than a year, reaching a market cap of $16 billion. Appropriately named, HYPE now sits at the center of a shift in stablecoins. Yesterday, Native Markets was selected through a validator vote to issue USDH, Hyperliquid’s first native stablecoin. The decision matters less for the issuer itself — a relatively new player — than for what it signals: stablecoin economics are changing, and established issuers such as Circle, whose USDC dominates Hyperliquid today, may feel the pressure. Hyperliquid holds about $5.97 billion in USDC balances, equal to roughly 8.2% of USDC’s total supply. Based on current federal funds rates, those deposits would generate more than $250 million annually in interest income for Circle and its partner Coinbase. USDH is designed to redirect that yield into Hyperliquid’s own ecosystem. If adoption succeeds, Circle could lose a substantial revenue stream while Hyperliquid strengthens its independence from external providers. Circle knows the stakes. CEO Jeremy Allaire responded on X: “Don’t Believe the Hype… We are coming to the HYPE ecosystem in a big way. We intend to be a major player and contributor to the ecosystem.” As Lucas Tcheyan of Galaxy Digital observed: “The competition for USDH underscores a shifting dynamic in stablecoin issuance where issuers must increasingly pay for distribution. Issuers are portraying themselves as indispensable partners, but in reality, they need Hyperliquid more than Hyperliquid needs them.” The process drew proposals from well-known names such as Paxos, Frax, Ethena, Sky (formerly MakerDAO), and Agora. Most offered to return nearly all reserve income — up to 100% — to win the mandate. Native Markets took a different approach, pledging a 50/50 split: half of the yield will go to Hyperliquid’s Assistance Fund, which buys back HYPE, and half to ecosystem growth initiatives. So it’s not all going to HYPE — but HYPE is still the clear beneficiary. Buybacks directly support the token, while ecosystem programs are intended to encourage wider use of USDH, reinforcing the same outcome. CoinGecko’s Vera Lim noted: “The outcome demonstrates the importance of ecosystem alignment and native knowledge over pure financial incentives in DeFi governance decisions.” The reserves will be managed through Stripe’s Bridge platform, with custody by BlackRock. Both MiCAR in Europe and the GENIUS Act in the U.S. prohibit stablecoins from paying interest to stablecoin holders. The aim is to ensure these instruments act as payment tools rather than investment products, and to protect bank deposits. On the surface, USDH complies. It is redeemable at par and pays no interest to holders. But in practice, the reserve income will be rerouted through HYPE buybacks and ecosystem subsidies. This is why some see the design as a circumvention of the rules. Yes, regulators prohibited stablecoins from paying yield directly; Hyperliquid has instead created a structure where the yield supports a governance token tied to the stablecoin’s adoption. Functionally, it introduces the same incentives regulators wanted to avoid. But the parallel with corporate America, including Circle, is worth noting. USDC holders receive no yield, but Circle’s shareholders benefit when USDC grows, since the company invests reserves in Treasuries. The difference is that Hyperliquid’s model makes the link explicit, folding it into the economics of its governance token. For readers unfamiliar with the platform, Hyperliquid is a decentralized exchange (DEX) built on its own blockchain. It has quickly become the leading venue for decentralized perpetual futures, with around 70% market share and monthly volumes approaching $400 billion. Until now, the network has relied almost entirely on USDC. That dependency has meant billions in deposits flow to Circle and Coinbase, even though the activity is generated within Hyperliquid. USDH is intended to capture that value internally while reducing reliance on external, permissioned stablecoins. The USDH vote points to three broader trends. First, issuers must now increasingly pay for adoption. Stablecoins are no longer judged only by trust in the issuer but by how much value is returned to the ecosystems where they circulate. Second, regulation lags design. MiCAR and GENIUS assume stablecoins can be kept in a non-interest-bearing model. USDH shows how quickly new structures can emerge that satisfy the letter of the rules while challenging their intent. Third, governance tokens matter. HYPE’s 1,533% surge reflects not just speculation but the market’s expectation that yield, even if banned on paper, will find its way back to users and investors through other channels. The 50/50 split ensures not all yield goes to HYPE, but it leaves the token as the central beneficiary. On paper, Native Markets won the USDH mandate. In practice, the validator vote underscored how stablecoins are evolving into ecosystems where yield is too valuable to leave untouched. MiCAR and GENIUS sought to prevent stablecoins from competing with bank deposits by banning interest payments. USDH shows how difficult that goal will be to enforce. The design makes a formal distinction between “money” and “investment,” yet blurs it in substance by turning stablecoin adoption into a source of yield for the community — a role once reserved for bank deposits.

Title: Franklin Templeton Bets Blockchain Will Transform Asset Management
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/christerholloman/2025/09/16/franklin-templeton-bets-blockchain-will-transform-asset-management/
Time Published: 2025-09-16T10:00:00Z

ByChrister Holloman, Contributor. The payments and asset management industries are undergoing a fundamental reset. A report from McKinsey published this summer finds that stablecoins and tokenized cash are emerging as serious challengers to incumbent infrastructure, with transaction volumes forecast to reach as much as $250 billion per day within three years. That inflection point is forcing banks, asset managers, and technology providers to move quickly or risk irrelevance. Few incumbents are leaning in as aggressively as Franklin Templeton. The firm’s head of digital assets, Roger Bayston, says blockchain technology is not a side project but a new foundation for how securities, funds, and collateral will be issued, traded, and managed. Roger Bayston, Head of Digital Assets at Franklin Templeton Bayston recalls that Franklin Templeton’s early work in the space was pure R&D. The question was basic: What could distributed ledgers do for an asset manager? The answer was equally basic at first, eliminate costly reconciliations and duplicative ledgers that plague capital markets. But once the regulatory picture began to shift in the U.S. earlier this year, the firm moved from exploration to commercialization. “The biggest challenge we faced for years was the regulatory construct,” Bayston said. “That changed dramatically after the first of the year. Now it’s about focus, delivery, and scaling what we’ve incubated into real products.” Franklin Templeton’s showcase product is Benji, the blockchain-enabled representation of its U.S. Government Money Fund. Instead of holding shares in a brokerage account, investors hold a token in a digital wallet. Transfers are nearly instantaneous, and the fund pays intraday yield calculated down to the second, a feature impossible in legacy systems. While the concept may sound niche, demand is growing. Early adopters include crypto-native firms and exchanges looking for a yield-bearing alternative to stablecoins in collateral management. Bayston noted that these clients want to post collateral that earns income, not sit idle. In practice, that means Benji can slot into derivatives and lending markets where stablecoins dominate today. McKinsey’s report highlights exactly this convergence. Yield-bearing, tokenized cash equivalents are becoming popular complements to traditional stablecoins, with Franklin Templeton, BlackRock, and Ondo among the early movers. For Bayston, tokenization is not just about faster money funds. It is about transforming what investors can own, “We’ve updated transfer agency infrastructure with blockchain,” he said. “Now, previously illiquid or non-fungible assets, from private funds to fractional ownership of a sports team, can potentially be wrapped into a client portfolio alongside traditional securities.” Natalya Thakur, is CEO of Knova which provides the API infrastructure layer that unifies traditional and tokenized assets, helping institutions manage, automate, and transact across all asset types in real time and she commented, “Franklin Templeton’s launch of Benji shows how tokenization is making even the most traditional products, like government money funds, more dynamic and interoperable. Institutions are seeking to integrate tokenized and traditional assets into a single operational stack, where yields can be optimized and collateral can move instantly. Tokenized funds like Benji will thrive when paired with infrastructure that lets firms orchestrate them side-by-side with securities, stablecoins, and deposits.” That idea echoes McKinsey’s thesis that tokenized money, deposits, and securities could reshape capital markets, treasury operations, and even cross-border remittances. The implications extend beyond cost savings to entirely new product categories and customer segments. Franklin Templeton has already launched multiple versions of Benji, including U.S. and European Union structures. Early traction is strongest in crypto-native markets where the instrument is used as collateral, but Bayston envisions adoption in public markets as regulations catch up. He points to recent developments like the EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets regulation and the U.S. GENIUS Act as accelerants. With clearer rules, tokenized funds can coexist with, or even displace, stablecoins in mainstream financial plumbing. Bayston avoids bold five-year predictions, but he is confident about the near term. Franklin Templeton has built a tokenization platform across public and private funds. The next step is deploying it widely across its asset management businesses. “We know the wallet ecosystems have hundreds of millions of customers we don’t touch today,” Bayston said. “Meeting their needs is a tremendous opportunity for us.” The McKinsey report argues that 2025 could be the year stablecoins and tokenized assets cross into the financial mainstream. For Franklin Templeton, the shift is already underway. By blending plain-vanilla money funds with blockchain rails, the firm is proving that tokenization is not just a theory but a functioning business model. If other incumbents hesitate, they may find themselves disrupted not by fintechs but by peers willing to rewire their infrastructure for the digital era.

Title: Coinbase’s XRP Decline Continues: 90% Crash In Exchange’s Reserves Tells Story Of Investor Accumulation
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/coinbases-xrp-decline-continues/
Time Published: 2025-09-16T00:00:46Z
Full Content:
Coinbase’s XRP reserves have witnessed one of the strongest collapses among major crypto exchanges, and this has caused questions as to where the tokens are going. According to on-chain data, the exchange’s cold wallets now hold only a fraction of the XRP they once did, and the decline is now more than 90%. This comes at a time when the XRP community has been closely monitoring institutional activity, with growing rumors of BlackRock and other heavyweight firms quietly building exposure to XRP. Recent moves by Coinbase with its XRP holdings have taken most crypto investors by surprise. Previous data showed that Coinbase, which was once the fifth-largest holder of XRP, has trimmed its XRP reserve balance from approximately 780.13 million XRP to 199.47 million. This was a cutback of about 69% in its holdings since the second quarter of 2025. However, on-chain data tracked by the @XRPwallets account on the social media platform X shows that Coinbase hasn’t stepped back from slashing its XRP holdings. As recently revealed by @XRPwallets, Coinbase now has just six cold wallets holding about 16.5 million XRP each. This leaves the US-based exchange with an estimated 99 million XRP in total. By comparison, the exchange had 52 cold wallets as recently as June 9, with 10 wallets holding 26.8 million XRP each and another 42 wallets holding 16.8 million XRP each. Combined, that amounted to nearly 970 million XRP under Coinbase’s control. In other words, the most recent numbers mean that Coinbase has shed about 90% of its XRP reserves within the past three months. Such a strong reduction in the movement of XRP away from Coinbase has been linked to accumulation into institutional wallets in anticipation of the launch of a Spot XRP ETF in the US. It also corresponds with previous reports about BlackRock’s indirect involvement with XRP through Coinbase’s custodial services. The scale of outflows from Coinbase’s XRP reserves has taken many crypto investors by surprise, as seen by comments on social media platforms. For instance, XRPwallets hinted at the possibility of these huge movements being linked to BlackRock. An account on the social media platform X, known as Stern Drew, suggested that Coinbase’s sell-offs go with a deliberate strategy to suppress XRP’s price. This was met with a firm rejection by pro-XRP lawyer Bill Morgan, who was quick to push back on the manipulation claims. Although there has been no official confirmation, the most plausible explanation of these large XRP exits is mostly linked to the eventual launch of an XRP ETF. The odds of the SEC accepting an XRP ETF in 2025 are now at a 94% chance on Polymarket. Bloomberg analysts also place the odds at a 90% chance or higher. Large institutions could be accumulating XRP in anticipation of such a product, and the reduced supply on exchanges could contribute to buying pressure even before it is launched. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $3, down by 2.9% in the past 24 hours. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: Should We Ban Quarterly Reporting?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/shivaramrajgopal/2025/09/15/should-we-ban-quarterly-reporting/
Time Published: 2025-09-15T23:53:55Z
Full Content:
ByShivaram Rajgopal, Contributor. The move confuses corporate investing myopia with the frequency of reporting One of the new policy initiatives that has garnered much attention is to cancel quarterly reporting by publicly listed firms. The motivation appears to be the need to get out of “quarterly capitalism” or CEOs focused on beating quarterly estimates of EPS, instead of worrying about beating overseas firms that have a much longer horizon of decades when they make investment decisions. 1.0 This was tried in the UK Before we do anything, it is useful to learn from the experience of other advanced markets that have tried this before. The UK, in 2014, banned mandatory quarterly reporting and went to a six-monthly cycle. My co-authors, Suresh Nallareddy, and Bob Pozen, and I studied the observable consequences of that change. Here is what we found: 2,0 Will less frequent reporting curb the real causes of investment myopia, if any? Part of the confusion stems from the real causes of investment myopia. In my mind, the real policy problems, underlying investment myopia, are as follows: 2.1 Expensing investments in intangible assets Capital market participants pay attention to earnings numbers. Earnings numbers, in the US, co-mingle signals about current operating performance and investment outlays. That is, investment in R&D and human capital in SG&A lines are expensed as per US GAAP. This leads, all else constant, to cutting investment outlays in intangibles to make the earnings numbers look good. Expanding the reporting window to six months will not improve investments, as we found. Why? Most investments have a three year or a five-year payoff horizon. Are we willing to allow firms to report once in three to five years? Most likely not. 2.2 A company’s investors are rarely that company’s frequent traders In my class, I often show students the list of a firm’s top 10-25 owners relative to funds that traded the most quarter. The largest owners for big companies are predictably the large index funds such as BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street. Traders are usually hedge funds. Going to half yearly reporting might potentially lead to even more trading by hedge funds who are more interested in predicting near term stock price changes rather than long term fundamentals. This may even lead to greater opportunities for managers to exploit inside information to time their trades or the firms’ financing activities. 2.3 CEO and CFO tenure is down CEO and CFO tenure in the US are at historic lows, at six and four years respectively, for all sorts of reasons other than reporting frequency. If your expected term with a firm is 16 quarters, of course quarterly reporting matters. Many CEOs I have chatted with complain that it will take five to six years for any of their investment initiatives to bear fruit. Half of them will be gone by then. Unless we can somehow change CEO and CFO tenures, tinkering with reporting frequency will do little. 3.0 Other mitigating factors 3.1 Compliance costs are coming down If the concern stems from compliance costs, things are only becoming easier. With AI and back-office automation, we can get to even more frequent reporting than a quarter, should we want to. 3.2 Markets lose a check in point for the company Quarterly reports validate or refute short term narratives that investors or traders have in a stock. Losing that avenue for checking on the progress or lack thereof of such a narrative will only increase return volatility. Return momentum on imprecise or simply wrong narratives will run for longer. As and when evidence against that narrative comes out, either via six monthly reports or from some other source, the crash in the stock price will be more vicious than otherwise. Frauds will take that much longer to discover when the firm can legally perpetuate radio silence. In sum, I worry that the debate confuses investment myopia with reporting frequency. Going to six monthly mandatory reporting is not a silver bullet. Instead, we must get to grips with the changing nature of capital markets, traders and managerial incentives.

Title: Ethereum Faces September Profit-Taking Risks Despite $638M ETF Boost

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Ethereum (ETH) continues to capture institutional attention as strong inflows into spot ETFs highlight the growing demand. According to SoSoValue, Ethereum funds recorded $638 million in net inflows between September 8–12, 2025, with Fidelity’s FETH leading at $381 million. This marked the fourth consecutive week of gains and pushed cumulative Ethereum ETF inflows above $13.3 billion. While the inflows strengthen Ethereum’s long-term investment case, historical trends and on-chain signals suggest September profit-taking risks may resurface. Despite trading near $4,520 on September 15, ETH faces mixed market signals that could dictate its next major move. Ethereum ETFs are becoming a major part of the crypto market, with total assets under management surpassing $30 billion. Fidelity and BlackRock accounted for most of the latest inflows, while Grayscale and Bitwise also recorded steady gains. Institutional accumulation continues to reshape Ethereum’s market dynamics. Exchange reserves have dropped to their lowest levels since 2016, reflecting reduced selling pressure as more ETH flows into long-term holdings. Additionally, over 36 million ETH, about 30% of supply, is staked, further tightening liquidity. Despite the bullish inflows, history paints a cautious picture. September has typically been a weak month for ETH, with a median return of -12.7% since its launch. Current on-chain data supports this caution: the percentage of ETH supply in profit recently peaked near 99%, signaling overheated conditions. Past profit peaks have often led to 8–9% pullbacks. Furthermore, derivatives data shows Ethereum trading within a rising wedge pattern, a structure that often precedes corrections. Key support lies at $4,485 and $4,382, while resistance levels target $4,760 and $4,945. Ethereum’s fundamentals currently remain strong. ETF inflows, whale accumulation, and shrinking exchange supply provide structural support. If ETH holds above $4,700, cascading liquidations could propel a move toward the $4,900–$5,000 range. However, traders must remain cautious. With September’s track record of corrections and elevated profit-taking signals, Ethereum could face short-term volatility even as its long-term case strengthens. Ethereum’s next test will be whether it can sustain momentum beyond September, breaking the cycle of seasonal weakness while capitalizing on growing institutional demand.

Title: Dragonfly’s Haseeb proposes holder scores, crowdsales to replace current airdrop model

Haseeb Qureshi advocated for meta-incentives based on users' historical token behavior rather than platform-specific metrics. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Dragonfly managing partner Haseeb Qureshi proposed a reputation system to reward users on token distributions through airdrops. On a Sept. 15 post via X, he shared a reform plan to filter airdrop farmers who dump tokens immediately after launches. Qureshi responded to Aztec CMO Claire Kart’s critique that airdrops “tank your chart” and provide “lazy alignment” by drawing parallels to IPO allocation methods. Companies offer institutional investors like BlackRock preferential pricing because these firms demonstrate long-term holding patterns, while retail investors pay market prices due to unpredictable behavior. Qureshi stated: “It’s crazy that token distributions don’t work this way.” He advocated for meta-incentives based on users’ historical token behavior rather than platform-specific metrics. The Dragonfly partner proposed standardized holder scores tracking token retention curves, governance participation, fee spending, liquidity provision, and product usage across multiple protocols. Projects would publish these scores in JSON format, enabling other teams to incorporate reputation data into distribution decisions. Qureshi argued that this creates accountability across the ecosystem. Users who know about future airdrops consider their holding history when modifying their behavior toward long-term commitment rather than immediate selling. Credit bureaus operate similarly, with financial institutions sharing customer data to encourage responsible behavior. The framework recommended limiting free airdrops to under 15% of total token generation events while selling the majority through score-tiered crowdsales. Better holder scores receive larger allocations at lower prices, while mercenary farmers pay full price or receive no access. Qureshi stated that the proposal addresses fundamental airdrop problems by requiring skin in the game. Users paying for tokens create committed holder bases versus recipients of free money seeking immediate exits. Crowdsales also provide built-in sybil resistance, as creating thousands of farming accounts becomes economically prohibitive. He acknowledged airdrops remain useful for pay-for-performance scenarios requiring specific measurable activities like total value locked or trading volume. However, Qureshi concluded that broad “helicopter money” distributions only attract artificial activity that disappears after token launches.

In a statement, Zabik cited Davis’ talented and deep roster, its vertically integrated investment structure, and track record of $13.5 billion worth of CRE investments as his reasons for making the jump, noting the company’s ability to execute “a differentiated middle-market credit strategy.” “I’m excited to join Davis at this pivotal moment of growth,” Zabik added. In addition to his work spearheading credit investment, Zabik will be tasked with guiding Davis’ high-yielding mortgage investment businesses, as well as advising on select preferred equity and mezzanine investments. His work will also concentrate on purchasing performing notes, single-asset debt securities and commercial mortgage-backed securities. “Alex’s expertise in the credit markets and his proven ability to execute sophisticated investment strategies make him an ideal leader to drive our focused expansion into the credit business,” said Stephen Davis, president of Davis. “This move strengthens our platform and positions us to execute credit transactions through a value-driven, opportunistic approach which leverages the breadth of our firm’s in-house capabilities.” Zabik spent the early part of his 30-year career at BlackRock, where he helped grow the firm’s high-yield commercial real estate debt business over nine years. Then he joined WestRiver Capital, where he spent 16 years as a senior managing director of a $188 million private equity credit fund. Over the course of his three-decade career, he has overseen $5 billion in strategic CRE investments, according to a release from Davis. Brian Pascus can be reached at bpascus@commercialobserver.com.

Title: XRP’s Market Cap Beats Out Heavy Hitters In Climb Into 100 Top Global Assets — Here Are The Numbers

Full Content:
XRP has climbed back into the top 100 global assets by market cap, surpassing some notable names, following its reclaim of the psychological $3 level. This comes amid a broader crypto market rally, which has sparked hopes of a continuation of the bull run. Companies Market Cap data shows that XRP’s market cap is larger than that of the world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock, and also Sony. The altcoin’s market cap is currently at around $182 billion, while BlackRock and Sony boast a market cap of $173 and $174 billion, respectively. Meanwhile, based on its market cap, XRP currently sits as the 88th largest asset, just behind Xiaomi. It is worth noting that the altcoin has briefly surpassed banking giant Citigroup, Verizon, and Shopify following a rally of over 3% over the weekend. However, XRP has pared some of these gains and now looks to be consolidating in preparation for the next leg to the upside. XRP’s rally comes amid a broad crypto market rally, with other major altcoins like Ethereum, Dogecoin, BNB, and Solana recording significant gains. Some fundamentals could serve as a catalyst for higher XRP prices, as its market cap looks to surpass more companies on the global assets ranking. This includes the launch of the REX-Osprey XRP ETF that is set to take place this week. This will be the first U.S. XRP fund to provide institutional investors with spot exposure to the altcoin. This is expected to inject new liquidity into the XRP ecosystem. Meanwhile, the Fed is expected to make a rate cut at this week’s FOMC meeting. This is typically bullish for altcoins for XRP, although there is also the possibility that it may be a ‘sell the news’ event. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez has predicted that the XRP price could rally to $3.6 following its breakout above $3.05. He had earlier stated that there were two possible scenarios. One possibility is that it could break above $3.05 and then rally to $3.60, or it could dip to $2.80, break above $2.90, and then rally to $3.60. Meanwhile, crypto analyst Dark Defender highlighted $3.01 and $2.85 as the major support levels to watch out for as the XRP price prepares for another leg to the upside. The analyst stated that the targets are the $4.39 and the $5.85 Fibonacci levels. A rally to these price levels would mark a new all-time high (ATH) for the altcoin.

Title: Astranis and Impulse Space Sign Agreement for 2027 Mission, Direct-Inject to GEO

September 15, 2025 12:35 ET | Source: Impulse Space Impulse Space REDONDO BEACH, Calif. and SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 15, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Impulse Space, the leader for in-space mobility, and Astranis, manufacturer of advanced high-orbit satellites, signed a contract today for an upcoming mission to GEO. Targeting a 2027 launch, the mission will utilize a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket launch to low Earth orbit (LEO), where it will deploy Impulse’s Helios kick stage. Leveraging chemical propulsion via its powerful Deneb engine, Helios will then deliver Astranis MicroGEO satellites from LEO to GEO in less than 24 hours, deploying them to their target orbital regime in geostationary orbit. This mission will showcase the capabilities of Astranis and Impulse to rapidly deploy satellites to geostationary orbit without the use of a Heavy-class rocket, a mission profile appealing to government and commercial customers alike. Astranis satellites provide dedicated, secure, enterprise-grade communications from GEO for customers around the world. Geostationary orbit allows a single satellite to provide 24/7 operational service, but reaching that orbit requires traversing the radiation-laden Van Allen Belts that surround the planet. Traditionally, Astranis satellites have used efficient but low thrust electric propulsion thrusters to make the orbit raise maneuver, which can take months. By using Helios to rapidly transit between orbits, Astranis will avoid the cost and risk of a slower transit, instead arriving at the target destination in a matter of hours after launch. “We selected Impulse’s Helios vehicle for this mission because it offers a faster, more reliable, and more cost-effective way for us to get our satellites operational and delivering service to customers,” said John Gedmark, co-founder and CEO of Astranis. “Demonstrating new methods of rapidly deploying satellites to geostationary orbit is important for both our government and commercial customers, and Impulse is the perfect partner for us in this effort.” “This is exactly the type of mission that Helios is designed for,” said Eric Romo, President and COO of Impulse Space. “By providing rapid transport to higher energy orbits, we help operators like Astranis to begin delivering on their mission promise sooner. And with our vertically-integrated approach to design, manufacturing, and testing, we offer reliability and schedule assurance to further de-risk the mission profile.” Astranis will be flying as the primary payload on the mission, with the potential for secondary payloads to be added later. About Impulse SpaceImpulse Space, the in-space mobility leader, is accelerating our future beyond Earth beginning with its fleet of cost-effective, high-performance space vehicles: Helios and Mira. The Helios kick stage unlocks high-energy orbits with its powerful Deneb engine, rapidly transporting payloads from LEO to MEO, GEO, heliocentric, lunar, and other planetary orbits. The flight-proven Mira enables precise maneuverability and rapid responsiveness for hosting, deployment, and rendezvous and proximity operations (RPO) across any orbit. Founded by Tom Mueller and led by a team of industry pioneers, Impulse Space is transforming in-space mobility by reliably and rapidly getting customers where they want to go. And they're just getting started.

Today Astranis satellites provide dedicated, secure networks to highly-sophisticated customers across the globe—large enterprises, sovereign governments, and the US military. With five satellites on orbit and many more set to launch soon, the company is servicing a backlog of more than $1 billion of commercial contracts. Astranis is the preferred satellite communications partner for buyers with stringent requirements for uptime, data security, network visibility, and customization. Astranis has raised over $750 million from some of the world’s best investors, from Andreessen Horowitz to Blackrock, and Fidelity, and employs a team of 450 engineers and entrepreneurs. Astranis designs, builds, and operates its satellites out of its 153,000 sq. ft. headquarters in Northern California, USA. Contact:contact@astranis.com

Title: Flexport Projects 2025 Profit from Convoy Sale, Eyes More Market Share by 2026
URL: https://sourcingjournal.com/topics/logistics/flexport-projects-2025-profit-convoy-organic-growth-freight-forwarder-ryan-petersen-1234777450/
Time Published: 2025-09-15T15:30:00Z
Full Content:
By Glenn Taylor Flexport anticipates it will be in profitable in 2025 thanks to the freight tech company’s sale of the Convoy freight-matching platform. The digital freight forwarder targeted profitability by the end of this year, with CEO Ryan Petersen telling the Wall Street Journal that the Convoy sale was a “one-time event” that “was more than our burn rate for this year.” Flexport sold the once-defunct freight booking platform to DAT Freight & Analytics for $250 million, flipping it nearly two years after acquiring the technology stack out of insolvency for roughly $16 million. Without the Convoy sale, Flexport would not be able to reach its 2025 profitability goal, Petersen said. The founder said the company is now on track for a profitable 2026 driven by organic growth as it expands into new countries, cuts costs and seeks to take more market share from larger competitors in the freight forwarding industry like DHL, C.H. Robinson, Kuehne+Nagel and DSV. According to the WSJ article, Flexport opened an office in Indonesia earlier this month and plans to launch in six additional countries in 2026. The company’s growth is contingent on an industry that has been hit heavily by decreased demand and slower shipping volume growth in recent years, ultimately resulting in lower freight rates. Package delivery titans like UPS and FedEx have been hit hard by the demand shifts, with both implementing mass cost-cutting efforts to save billions of dollars and improve efficiency. Related Stories Topics CBP Certifies 12 Companies to Collect International Duties After De Minimis Ban Topics Trucking Bankruptcies Pile Up on Soft Demand Flexport is one of many logistics businesses that has had to maneuver the on-and-off tariff whiplash of 2025. Customers had to suspend or stop freight bookings altogether when the U.S. tacked “reciprocal” duties on imports from trade partners worldwide in April, before rushing orders into the country again after the tariffs were given a three-month delay. The back-and-forth resulted in a brief (and early) peak shipping season that saw year-over-year cargo growth at U.S. ports in July, before inbound volumes began their downturn starting in August. Air freight at Flexport took a hit as well, not just from the tariffs, but from the closure of the duty-free de minimis provision. The Trump administration banned the trade exemption for low-value shipments out of China at the start May, before putting a stop to the provision for any foreign goods headed to the U.S. in late August. As volumes on the Asia-to-U.S. trade lane suffered, Flexport moved less air cargo for its clients. “Air freight prices are quite low because of the end of de minimis shipping,” Petersen told CNBC in a Friday interview. “That was a huge percentage of the world’s air freight that’s more or less gone away.” According to Petersen, Flexport’s warehousing and customs brokerage businesses have benefitted from the U.S. trade policy shifts. Flexport’s gross profit on its customs brokerage and compliance business is up 99 percent year over year in 2025. From a financial perspective, Flexport had still been losing money prior to the Convoy deal. Shopify’s earnings results in August indicate that the e-commerce company incurred a net loss of $24 million on its Flexport investment in the second quarter. Those results are reported on a one-quarter delay, meaning the loss came in Flexport’s April-to-June quarter. Combined with the quarter prior, Shopify lost $47 million over the latest six months reported by Flexport. In total, Shopify’s investment in Flexport is $595 million as of June 30, down from $642 million six months prior. Given that the tech titan has a 17 percent stake in Flexport as of Sept. 30, 2023, Flexport’s estimated valuation stands at $3.5 billion, still a far cry from its peak of $8 billion in February 2022 when the company hauled in a $935 million Series E funding round. As the company hopes to improve its fortunes in 2026, is expanding its supply chain financing business by partnering with asset management firm BlackRock. With the team up, Flexport is expanding financing options for companies facing higher tariff costs and other trade-related strains on cash flow. BlackRock-managed funds and accounts will provide $250 million to Flexport within the partnership, nearly doubling Flexport’s current lending capacity, the companies say. The freight tech firm’s financial services arm, Flexport Capital, has provided more than $2 billion since it started in 2017. The BlackRock partnership will last four years, and allows financing across various points of companies’ supply chains through purchase orders, inventory pickup, freight movement, warehousing and final delivery.

The streak ran across all five trading sessions from September 8 to September 12, according to aggregated data from Farside and SoSoValue. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust led with just over $1 billion of inflows, while Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund brought in nearly $850 million. Other issuers, including Ark Invest and Bitwise, also posted gains, though smaller. Daily flows showed steady demand. Monday started with $364 million, followed by a muted $23 million on Tuesday. The pace accelerated to $742 million on Wednesday, $553 million on Thursday, and $642 million on Friday. Last week’s inflows “signal clear demand impulse, the one that looks both meaningful and timely,” Georgii Verbitskii, a derivatives trader and founder of decentralized protocol TYMIO, told Decrypt. With September to October marking “the start of the business season,” Verbitskii notes that the this “often sets the tone for trends that play out through the end of the year.” The base case, he added, is that this could be “the beginning of a new uptrend, with strong potential for further growth into Q4.” Still, while the inflows show a marked return to mid-July levels, “the number itself isn’t transformative on its own,” Wesley Crook, CEO of blockchain engineering firm FP Block, told Decrypt. “Much of this activity is being driven by expectations of rate cuts alongside the broader trend of enterprises entering the market,” Crook said, adding that he expects the momentum to likely continue as institutional allocations for Bitcoin bring “upward pressure on prices.” The surge aligned with growing expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve will cut rates at its next meeting set this week, with users of prediction market Myriad, launched by Decrypt’s parent company DASTAN, placing an 88% chance on a 25bps rate cut. During the same period, Bitcoin's price recovered above $115,000, reinforcing investor optimism. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is changing hands at around $114,600, per CoinGecko data. “Structural demand is the real story here,” Farbod Sadeghian, founder of Dubai-headquartered international virtual asset chamber TheBlock., told Decrypt. While rate cut expectations could provide “a friendlier backdrop for risk assets,” such a setting is temporary, Sadeghian said. “The bigger factor is that investors, especially at the institutional level, now see Bitcoin as an allocation worth holding over the long term,” he said, adding that “the ETF wrapper makes it easier and safer to access, but the underlying appetite is clearly about exposure to the asset itself.” On the broader end, Sadeghian notes that Bitcoin ETF inflows, while “never perfectly smooth,” could expect to “stabilize and scale further” over macro-driven momentum as institutional investors steadily “integrate Bitcoin ETFs into standard portfolios.” Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2025 Decrypt Media, Inc.

BySandy Carter, Contributor. Over the past few weeks, I had the opportunity to sit down with Shan Aggarwal, Coinbase's newly appointed Chief Business Officer—a first-of-its-kind role at the crypto exchange. Shan’s background defies the conventional tech-executive mold: having started on the medical path with a Bachelor of Science in Neuroscience from UCLA, then pivoting and working his way to a position on the forefront of crypto’s corporate strategy, M&A, and partnerships. From managing capital raising and capital markets activity from Coinbase’s 2018 Series E through its 2021 public listing, to rising as one of the youngest executives at a Fortune 500 today, Shan’s leadership comes at a pivotal moment for the company. With institutional demand surging and regulatory clarity emerging, Aggarwal is tasked with driving Coinbase's next phase of growth beyond its roots as a retail trading platform. Here's what he shared about the company's strategy, market outlook, and vision for crypto's mainstream future. My role as Chief Business Officer is really about connecting all the dots across Coinbase’s growth engine. I oversee our ecosystem partnerships, business operations and strategy, data and analytics, M&A, and investments. Think of it as being the bridge between our product teams and the market opportunities we're seeing, defining what we should do and how we should execute. I'm focused on how we grow Coinbase, not just as a trading platform, but as the infrastructure that powers the entire crypto economy. That means working with institutions, retail partners, and emerging projects to embed crypto into the core of global financial infrastructure. First, we're focused on building the best trading products by adding support for assets beyond crypto in order to cater to traders. This includes equities, futures and perpetual futures, crypto-native assets, prediction markets, and more. Second, we're leveraging the platform that we've built to enable institutional adoption. Enterprise demand is massive right now, and we've built this amazing platform that's turnkey for partners to offer crypto trading, staking, and more to their end users. Third, we're focused on payments and expanding stablecoin adoption. We're building products that enable first-party payments and a platform for other businesses to offer crypto payments. Throughout these priorities, we remain focused on international expansion: scaling our global footprint and driving our mission to expand economic freedom for people and businesses everywhere. Growth today is about quality over quantity. We're not chasing vanity metrics. It's about deepening relationships with our highest-value customers and expanding our share of their crypto needs. That means driving deeper engagement with our customers by broadening the range of services that we offer to include more than trading – saving, spending, financing, and more. We're also seeing huge opportunities in B2B growth – powering other companies' crypto strategies rather than just serving end consumers directly. We call this Crypto as a Service. With increasing regulatory clarity, we can offer white-label solutions and infrastructure APIs that let other companies integrate crypto without building from scratch. The enterprise builder ecosystem is massive. Think about all the fintech companies, payment processors, and traditional businesses that want crypto capabilities but don't want to deal with compliance, custody, or technical complexity. We become their crypto backbone. We're seeing this through our partnerships with BlackRock and PNC using our infrastructure for their institutional crypto services, and companies like Perplexity integrating crypto data into their platform. These partnerships are game-changing because they bring crypto to users who might never download a crypto app. We’re not just growing our direct user base, we're powering crypto adoption across the entire digital economy. This approach allows us to broaden the base of end users that we serve and accelerate crypto adoption. Stablecoins represent a platform shift in payments. We believe that all of the asset classes in the world will eventually come onchain, and we see stablecoins as one of the first and most important categories. The regulatory clarity that we're starting to see legitimizes stablecoins and sets a clear foundation for growth with a consistent framework for essential components like reserve requirements and transparency. I think we'll see a bifurcation between compliant, transparent stablecoins and everything else. The winners will be the operators who work closely with regulators rather than against them. We’re already starting to see stablecoins get more deeply integrated into the traditional financial system, and I expect that this will continue as stablecoins offer a more efficient, global, and lower-cost rail for moving dollars. Overall, a digital economy needs digital money — stablecoins are that missing piece. And Coinbase is uniquely positioned post-GENIUS Act with broad USDC distribution and the ability to offer industry-leading rewards. We’re building for the long-term and thinking across cycles. In bear markets, we focus on scaling our infrastructure to support the next waves of adoption and investing in long-term builders. In bull markets, we focus on optimizing the customer experience and new product innovation. We're investing heavily in Coinbase as a platform because we believe that with regulatory clarity, more and more businesses will come into the space. We're also building new revenue streams that are less correlated with transaction volumes: stablecoin interest, custody fees, staking rewards, and more. The goal is to be anti-fragile regardless of where prices go. Traditional finance will play a pivotal role in crypto’s mainstream adoption by acting as a bridge between legacy systems and decentralized financial ecosystems. As CBO, I see partnerships with institutions like JPMorgan Chase and American Express as critical to accelerating adoption. These collaborations expand access to crypto, lower barriers for consumers, and integrate crypto into everyday financial activities, such as payments and rewards programs. (Read about Coinbase’s partnership with Perplexity as well.) By leveraging the trust and infrastructure of traditional finance, we can onboard the next wave of users into crypto, helping make economic freedom a reality for millions globally. We’re already seeing this now. We're seeing that those who were skeptical are asking how to custody Bitcoin for their clients, asset managers wanting crypto ETFs and index products, and payment companies seeking stablecoin rails. Our job is to be the infrastructure that lets them participate safely and compliantly. TradFi is meeting crypto, and Coinbase is the bridge. Real-world assets are huge right now. Tokenizing everything from real estate to commodities is unlocking new markets and creating liquidity where it didn’t exist before. DeFi is also maturing beyond just yield farming, becoming the backbone of new, legitimate financial infrastructure. At Coinbase, we believe the future of every asset class is onchain, and we’re laser-focused on building the infrastructure to make that vision a reality. The key is identifying use cases that solve real-world problems at real-world scale, not just fueling crypto-native speculation, although that’s important too. While we're excited about the steps the US has been taking toward regulatory clarity, there are massive opportunities globally in markets where the rules are clearer and the opportunities are immediate. Regions like Europe, Asia-Pacific, and Latin America are moving fast on crypto regulation and adoption, and we’re matching that pace by building local partnerships and compliance capabilities tailored to each region. While the US remains a critical market, we won’t let an incomplete regulatory picture here hold back our global ambitions. Crypto is a global phenomenon, and we’re positioning Coinbase to lead on that stage. We have and will continue to be very active on the M&A front. We believe that M&A is core to our growth engine, and a capability that we’ve built up over the years. Once we define a strategy, we always consider build, buy, and partner execution paths. We build core platform capabilities in-house because that's our bread and butter, and we need these to be deeply integrated with our platform. When we acquire, we’re looking for opportunities that accelerate our roadmap and bring differentiated technology, expertise, licensing, and/or a scaled business into our suite. Recent examples include Deribit, the leading crypto options exchange, as well as Spindl, a novel onchain advertising protocol and exchange. With these acquisitions, we’re strengthening our product capabilities and seeding new revenue opportunities. We also believe in the strength of amazing talent and have done smaller acqui-hires to bring in specialized teams. The key is integration – acquisitions only work if they strengthen our core platform rather than becoming isolated silos. I want Coinbase to be the best place for users, institutions, and their end clients to store and grow their wealth. Customers should know that they have access to differentiated opportunities on Coinbase, all through our trusted and intuitive products. That’s what we’re building towards: an everything exchange and full-fledged financial platform. Every asset you want to trade in a one-stop shop, and the best place to grow your money and manage everyday finances, all on crypto rails. Further, I want Coinbase to be synonymous with crypto infrastructure the way AWS is with cloud computing. Base is building a future onchain economy that powers a range of onchain crypto use cases, including financial, social, and much more. Whether you're a startup launching a token, a bank offering crypto services, or a country exploring digital currencies, Coinbase should be the trusted infrastructure partner. We want to be essential rather than optional, powering innovation across every sector that touches crypto. What I learned from my conversation with Shan is that Coinbase isn’t just preparing for the next bull run—it’s building the rails for crypto’s long-term future. The strategy is less about chasing hype cycles and more about embedding crypto into everyday finance, from powering institutional adoption to expanding stablecoin use cases and international markets. Shan made it clear that quality growth, deeper customer relationships, and serving as the “crypto backbone” for enterprises are the levers that matter most right now. I also walked away with a sharper view of Coinbase’s ambition: to become the “everything exchange” for digital assets and the AWS of crypto infrastructure. Whether it’s tokenizing real-world assets, creating compliant and trusted stablecoins, or bridging traditional finance with Web3, Shan’s vision is that Coinbase won’t just participate in the future of money. It will help define it. That’s a bold mission, and one I’ll be watching closely for Coinbase’s next moves.

Title: RWM Makes Barron’s Top 100 RIA Firms!

September 15, 2025 8:00am by Barry Ritholtz I am thrilled that Ritholtz Wealth Management has been recognized by Barron’s as one of the top 100 RIAs in the country. They report there are 15,870 independent registered investment advisory firms (RIAs); Top 100 means better than the top 1% of all firms.1 When we launched in 2013, twelve years ago (today!), as four advisors and an amazing admin who ran the place (Erika!), Kris Venne convinced all of us that an ensemble practice was the way to go. That turned out to be the best decision we made, as each of us gravitated to what we did best. A flywheel effect followed, with all of the founders expanding their expertise, creating momentum and high double-digit growth for more than a decade. All organically, without outside capital or M&A.2 None of this could have happened without that decision, nor could it have taken place without the 80 fantastic people who make RWM the very special place it is today. This is not false modesty; it is simply an acknowledgement of how proud I am to get to work with so many amazing people. Barron’s has always been special to me personally (I am old school). When I started as a trader 30 years ago(!), every Saturday morning was spent with a big mug of coffee and the print edition of the weekly Barron’s. I was thrilled to be quoted in August 2007 (Placid Times Ahead?), with the GFC looming.3 The first thing I ever published in a mainstream media outlet was a Memo to DC from Wall Street4 – the precursor to Bailout Nation. Thomas Donlan taught me what a great editor can do for your writing – make it all sinew and no fat. I have spoken at multiple Barron’s conferences, seminars, and events; they have always been wonderful experiences. When Barron’s ran a special article on Josh and me in 2020,5, it was thrilling. I was utterly delighted when Batnick was the focus of a profile in 2022.6 Over just this past year, my RWM colleagues and I have been quoted in Barron’s 20 times. To say this is meaningful to me dramatically understates the matter… ~~~ If you are an investor and would like to learn more about how we work with clients, please contact us at Info-AT-RitholtzWealth-DOT-Com. And if you are an advisor or in the financial industry and need some career guidance, we would love to chat with you. Please reach out to the same address, with ‘CAREER’ in the subject line.

Why M&A Isn’t in the Cards. By Andrew Welsch Barron’s, April 22, 2024 Michael Batnick: Crushing It With Content By Steve Garmhausen Barron’s Feb. 4, 2022 Barry Ritholtz and Josh Brown Won’t Predict The Market, But They’ll Talk About Anything Else. By Leslie P. Norton Barron’s, Dec 18, 2020 Previously: Barron’s: Placid Times Ahead? August 6, 2007 A Memo Found in the Street (*Mirror) By Barry L. Ritholtz Sept 29, 2008 Batnick: Crushing It With Content (February 6, 2022) __________ 1. Top 0.62% to be precise. There are ~17,000 firms, of which 15kish are registered with the S.E.C. That is to say nothing of all of the hybrid Broker-Dealers, and all the advisors at wire houses. FINRA reports there are 634,500 registered representatives in total. 2. When Blackrock decided in 2022 that their 2015 purchase of Future Advisor (their robo) was no longer their core focus, we agreed to purchase the book in 2023 and service those clients in our digital platform, with a live human advisor included. 3. Placid Times Ahead? By Jim McTague, Aug 06, 2007 4. A Memo Found in the Street By Barry L. Ritholtz Barron’s, Sept 29, 2008 As I wrote at the time, “It was a pleasure working with Thom Donlan on this, who turned my blunt, meandering scribbles into a razor-sharp scalpel.” 5. Barry Ritholtz and Josh Brown Won’t Predict The Market, But They’ll Talk About Anything Else. By Leslie P. Norton Barron’s, Dec 18, 2020 6. Michael Batnick: Crushing It With Content By Steve Garmhausen Barron’s Feb. 4, 2022 ~~~ Disclosure: Barron’s ranked Ritholtz Wealth Management (RWM) #100 in their 2025 “Barron’s Top RIA Firms” in September, 2025. The annual ranking is based on data compiled for RWM’s registered investment adviser and was based on June 30th data, including annual figures for the previous three years. No fee was paid for participation in the ranking. The ranking is based on firm surveys, and filings with the regulatory databases were used to cross-check the data provided. The rankings are based on assets managed by the firms, growth, technology spending, staff diversity, succession planning, and other metrics. The formula Barron’s uses to rank firms is proprietary. The formula features three major categories of calculations: (1) Assets (2) Revenue (3) Quality of practice. The number of firms included in the 2025 ranking was 100. For the first time, Barron’s is ranking the largest registered investment advisor firms separately from its broader RIA ranking. For our list of mega RIAs, we selected firms that manage 2% or more of the total assets of all ranking applicants. This year, that creates a threshold of $70 billion in assets.
