Business news in association with The world’s largest asset management firm has quietly abandoned plans for a multibillion-dollar climate fund to help New Zealand reach 100 percent renewable energy, just years after saying the initiative could serve as a global model. However, American multinational BlackRock insists it remains committed to its operations in the country, given its “appeal as a global investment destination”. In August 2023, the then-Labour government trumpeted BlackRock’s involvement in a “first of its kind” climate infrastructure fund, with the company attracting an initial $2 billion of investment for renewable energy projects like battery storage, wind and solar generation, and electric vehicle charging. “This is a game changer for the clean tech sector and another example of the pragmatic and practical steps the Government is taking to accelerate climate action while growing our economy,” then-Prime Minister Chris Hipkins said at the time, highlighting his government’s target of reaching 100 percent renewable energy by 2030. When the plans were first announced, BlackRock co-founder and chief executive Larry Fink (whose company has almost $22 trillion in assets under management worldwide) said the initiative would be the company’s “largest single-country low-carbon transition investment” to date. “It will enable New Zealand companies to access greater pools of capital to build out climate infrastructure across the country’s energy system including in wind power, solar power, battery storage, electric vehicle charging, and natural capital projects.” Praising the then-government’s ambition to build a more resilient energy system and become a global leader in decarbonisation, Fink said the fund could act as a model for cooperation between the private and public sectors “to ensure an orderly, just, and fair energy transition”. But the National-led coalition government rolled back a number of Labour’s climate commitments after taking office at the 2023 election, with Prime Minister Christopher Luxon saying the renewables target had put the country’s energy security at risk and would increase electricity prices while reducing reliability. In May 2024, BusinessDesk reported that BlackRock was yet to make any investments via the fund, although the company said it “firmly believes in the significant potential for deploying climate infrastructure and related enabling technologies … irrespective of changing policy settings”. Start your day informed. Make room for newsroom's top stories. Direct to your inbox daily. But in November last year, the firm asked the Companies Office to deregister the limited partnership connected to the initiative (New Zealand Climate Infrastructure Fund LP) on the grounds it had “ceased to carry on business”. In a written statement sent to Newsroom, a BlackRock spokesperson confirmed the fund was being scrapped, saying: “Following our acquisition of Global Infrastructure Partners and in response to client feedback, BlackRock will no longer proceed with a standalone New Zealand Climate Infrastructure Fund. “We continue to offer clients access to a suite of global infrastructure strategies that can invest into New Zealand, supported by our growing local presence.” The company remained committed to supporting New Zealand’s economic growth and infrastructure projects, having doubled its Auckland-based team to six people (including three infrastructure investors) in the last year. “BlackRock currently invests close to NZ$30 billion in New Zealand across public and private markets on behalf of clients, with approximately 75 percent sourced from offshore investors – underscoring the country’s appeal as a global investment destination.” What investments (if any) the firm made via the climate fund remains unclear, with Newsroom’s questions on the matter going unanswered. BlackRock has in recent years ramped up its presence in the New Zealand market, with mixed results. The company placed local solar installation firm SolarZero into liquidation in 2024, two years after acquiring the business, with 160 staff losing their jobs. The American firm copped criticism for its failure to pay out employees’ entitlements, with one former staffer telling Newsroom the case showed the dangers of foreign investment; the ex-staff did eventually receive outstanding pay as part of the liquidation process, although contractors were reportedly left out in the cold. At the time, BlackRock said it had explored several options to keep SolarZero operating but was unable to find a suitable solution, requesting the appointment of a liquidator “to ensure an orderly transition of the business in the interests of related stakeholders, including SolarZero’s customers, employees, creditors, and others”. Luxon’s Government has nonetheless continued to woo BlackRock, inviting the company to take part in last year’s high-profile Infrastructure Investment Summit to the consternation of former SolarZero staff. The Prime Minister had earlier met Fink during a 2024 trip to the United States, saying the pair had discussed “how New Zealand can attract more investment to strengthen our economy at home”. Climate Change and Energy Minister Simon Watts told Newsroom neither he nor officials had been contacted by BlackRock regarding its decision. Asked whether he had any concerns about what the move said about levels of appetite for foreign investment into climate infrastructure, Watts responded: “This is a commercial decision made by BlackRock. I expect no impact.” Newsroom exists because of readers like you. Help us deliver trusted, independent journalism that serves all New Zealanders. Support our work with a donation today.

More by Sam Sachdeva 8 Comments Shame, shame, shame on BlackRock . This tells us everything about their global investment strategies. This is also a clear signal for investment in biodiversity. Renewable energy infrastructure, climate adaptation, and biodiversity restoration all depend on long-term capital, credible frameworks, and policy settings that remain stable well beyond a single electoral cycle. When climate and energy targets are questioned or rolled back, it sends a broader message that natural capital, including biodiversity protection, restoration, and emerging biodiversity markets, is politically fragile. Investors do not separate climate from biodiversity. They assess whether a country is willing to maintain consistent rules, pricing signals, and institutional support over decades. When that confidence weakens, capital reallocates quietly, regardless of how strong the underlying environmental case may be. New Zealand’s ecological value and renewable resource base have not diminished. What has changed is the perceived durability of the policy environment needed to support long-horizon investment. If we want private capital to help deliver environmental outcomes, credibility and consistency matter more than ambition alone. After 12 months of the government gutting our climate and biodiversity goals, Blackrock clearly saw the writing on the wall. This government is not serious about protecting our natural environment and treasures. Heaven, or a progressive government, help us if we continue to let investment firms like this get their hands on core assets in this country. Check out These are the Plunderers – how Private Equity runs and wrecks America on Amazon Books. Or look at the story on You Tube about the fate of 37 Healthscope Hospitals in Australia under the management of Brookfield Asset Management. It’s happening here but barely rates a mention. An Australian accounting firm SBO Financial had this to say about the Healthscope debacle: Private equity walks into a business. Promises “synergies.” Murmurs “operational excellence.” Says they’re here to unlock value. What actually happens? • They lever it up 7x EBITDA. • Sell the real estate. • Attempt to trim costs by “streamlining operations” — a.k.a. cutting corners. Then they completely misread the market, margins tank, and the whole thing collapses under the weight of its own debt. Sound familiar? Of course it does. That’s the story of Healthscope. One of Australia’s largest private hospital networks — treating over 650,000 patients a year — is now in financial freefall. The company went from a $5bn pricetag to bankrupt in only 6 years. So how did Brookfield blow it? In 2019, the Canadian buyout giant dropped $5.7 billion to acquire Healthscope, slapped a debt bomb on it, sold off the hospitals, and cooked the operations. Fast-forward to now: • Revenue barely moved. • Costs soared. • Interest payments exploded. • Patient outcomes worsen • Declared bankruptcy, with sale process being run Or, as the ABC put it: “They’ve trashed the joint and now just dropped the keys and run away.” This government, in particular, sees foreign investment as the answer to our weak economy. Growth, growth, growth the Prime Minister repeats. The health sector is being run down, as is public housing investment. I fear this government is lining up our public services for foreign investors to takeover. It shows that we (NZ) are desperate for money to further our ‘climate support’ plans. This desperation for external financial help – in furthering our plans for clean energy, internal social support and manufacturing – is highlighting serious mis-management at the highest level of management – Government. The coalition has systematically dismantled almost all significant climate policies left to it by the previous Labour government. As Charmaine says above, “If we want private capital to help deliver environmental outcomes, credibility and consistency matter more than ambition alone.” Dealing with climate change requires concrete, long term actions and bipartisan agreement on the importance of adopting the relevant policies. Whether you are a dairy farmer or an IT worker, we are all affected eventually. No wonder Blackrock is pulling out, it’s just not financially worthwhile. Next, insurance companies will be increasing costs on policies covering flood etc to horrendously prohibitive levels or just plain refusing to insure. New Zealand will pay eventually, in some way or another. It staggers me how supposedly ‘conservative’ governments rip into energy-transition projects as ‘greenie rubbish’ when the transition from fossil fuels is currently the world’s most bankable global direction, strongly committed to by China and India and, until Trump, the US. The recent decision to let a dubious seabed mining venture drive out a massive wind farm was an act of serious economic harm by the coalition government, all to please a shrinking cohort of backwards-looking voters who feel it threatens their right to drive cheap, polluting cars on cheap, polluting fuel and farmers who just want to go on doing what they have always done.

Title: Why BlackRock isn't worried about rising defaults as it dives into private credit

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. BlackRock isn't seeing any cockroaches scurrying out of its private credit portfolio yet. The $14 trillion asset manager has become a major player in the private lending space after it acquired HPS at the end of 2024. The firm has been focused on fundraising for private markets, and CEO Larry Fink said Thursday during BlackRock's earnings call that the firm's distribution team was pitching HPS offerings to advisors for wealthy people at wirehouses like Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch. Private credit has seen explosive growth in recent years, as strategies brought in more than $220 billion in 2025, according to S&P. Still, several high-profile defaults, including auto parts supplier First Brands and auto lender Tricolor, have some wondering if there are more hidden risks in the credit market. "When you see one cockroach, there's probably more," JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon colorfully put it in October. BlackRock CFO Martin Small said the manager deployed $25 billion into private-market investments in 2025, including in private lending, and sees "generally stable credit conditions." Defaults are rising, he said, but that is to be expected after a period of historically low defaults, thanks to low interest rates. "Returning to normal defaults is something we expect," he said, adding that "context is critical" when looking at headlines about bankruptcies. Fitch Ratings said that private credit default rates for the past 12 months were 5.7% at the end of November, up from 5.2% a month prior. In November, Fitch recorded 13 default events, more than double the monthly average of 5.5. "It's not that there's nothing to see here," he said, but this is an "expected catch-up." BlackRock's portfolios are further insulated, he said, because they focus on lending to companies with sufficient earnings to repay loans. In the firm's closed-end investment company, HLEND, for example, loans have been made to companies with average annual earnings of $250 million. Small companies bringing in less than $50 million in annual earnings that took out loans when they were at their peak valuation "are the credits we'd expect to struggle," Small said. BlackRock ended the year with more than $145 billion in private credit assets, and "we see the structural pipeline of private credit fundraising and deployment as intact," Small said. Jump to

BlackRock NYSE: BLK executives used the firm’s fourth-quarter 2025 earnings call to highlight what Chief Financial Officer Martin Small described as “one of the strongest years in our history,” pointing to record net inflows, accelerating organic base fee growth, and continued expansion in technology services as the company enters 2026 with a fully integrated platform that now includes GIP, Preqin, and HPS. Get BlackRock alerts:Sign UpFinancial performance and capital return Small said clients awarded BlackRock nearly $700 billion in net new assets in 2025, alongside 9% organic base fee growth and 16% technology annual contract value (ACV) expansion. For the full year, BlackRock reported as-adjusted revenue of $24 billion, up 19% year over year, operating income of $9.6 billion, up 18%, and earnings per share of $48.09, up 10%. Why Bitcoin ETFs Like IBIT May Be Set to Surge in 2026In the fourth quarter, revenue was $7 billion, up 23% year over year, which Small attributed to the acquisitions of HPS and Preqin, organic base fee growth, and the impact of market moves on average assets under management (AUM). Fourth-quarter operating income was $2.8 billion, up 22%, while EPS rose 10% to $13.16. Small noted that quarterly EPS also reflected a lower tax rate, lower non-operating income, and a higher share count tied to the close of the HPS transaction on July 1. Non-operating results included $106 million of net investment losses, primarily from a non-cash mark-to-market loss related to BlackRock’s minority investment in Circle. Small said the company contributed a portion of its Circle stake to an existing donor-advised fund in mid-December, and that it still holds roughly 1.1 million shares of Circle common stock that will continue to be marked through investment income. The as-adjusted tax rate was about 20% in the quarter due to discrete items, and Small said the company currently estimates 25% as a “reasonable projected tax run rate” for 2026. Why Billions Are Flowing into IBIT, BlackRock's Bitcoin ETFBlackRock also emphasized shareholder returns. Small said the board approved a 10% increase to the first-quarter 2026 dividend per share and authorized repurchase of an additional 7 million shares. The company is targeting $1.8 billion of share repurchases during 2026, subject to market and other conditions. Base fees, technology growth, and margins Fourth-quarter base fees and securities lending revenue totaled $5.3 billion, up 19% year over year, driven by market beta on average AUM, organic base fee growth, and approximately $230 million in base fees from HPS. Performance fees were $754 million in the quarter, up from a year ago, and included $158 million from HPS. Technology services and subscription revenue grew 24% year over year in both the quarter and full year, reflecting client onboarding, expansions with existing clients, and the Preqin transaction. Small said Preqin added approximately $65 million of revenue in the fourth quarter and $213 million for the full year. ACV increased 31% year over year, including Preqin, and grew 16% organically. Expense growth was also discussed. Total expense rose 19% in 2025, driven primarily by higher compensation, sales and account expense, and G&A. Employee compensation and benefits increased 20% for the year, reflecting higher incentive compensation associated with performance fees and higher operating income, as well as the onboarding of employees from GIP, Preqin, and HPS. G&A increased 15% due largely to M&A transactions and higher technology investment spend. Fourth-quarter as-adjusted operating margin was 45%, down 50 basis points year over year, and the full-year margin was 44.1%, down 40 basis points. Small said both periods reflected the impact of performance fees and related compensation. Excluding performance fees and related compensation, he said the fourth-quarter adjusted margin would have been 45.5%, up 30 basis points year over year, and the full-year margin would have been 44.9%, up 60 basis points versus 2024. On the Q&A portion of the call, management reiterated its margin framework. Small said BlackRock continues to target a “45% or greater adjusted operating margin profile,” while describing upward momentum in margins on recurring fee-related earnings. He also said that after annualizing the impact of HPS and Preqin, management expects a mid-single-digit percentage increase in G&A and expects headcount to be “broadly flat” in 2026. Record flows led by iShares and diversified channels Small reported total net inflows of $698 billion in 2025, with iShares setting a record at $527 billion. He said iShares’ flows represented 12% organic asset growth and 13% organic base fee growth, with diversified demand across core equity and premium categories such as fixed income, active, and digital assets exchange-traded products (ETPs). Fourth-quarter iShares net inflows were $181 billion. Retail net inflows were $107 billion, which Small said was led by the onboarding of an $80 billion separately managed account (SMA) assignment from Citi Wealth in the fourth quarter. He also noted record inflows at Aperio, net inflows in active fixed income, and $12 billion of alternatives inflows during 2025. Institutional active net inflows totaled $54 billion in 2025, reflecting multiple outsourcing mandates, the above-target close of GIP V, and deployment in private credit. Institutional index saw net outflows of $119 billion, which Small attributed mainly to redemptions from low-fee index equity strategies. In private markets, Small said the platform delivered $40 billion of net inflows for the year, led by private credit and infrastructure. BlackRock also reiterated its fundraising ambition, targeting $400 billion in gross private markets fundraising through 2030. BlackRock Cash Management saw $74 billion of net inflows in the fourth quarter and $131 billion in 2025, driven by U.S. government, international prime, and Circle reserve funds. Strategic priorities: private markets, wealth, insurance, and retirement Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink said BlackRock entered 2026 with “accelerating momentum” and highlighted the company’s record quarterly and annual net inflows, including $342 billion in the fourth quarter. He said the firm’s pipeline has broadened across public and private markets, technology and data, and client channels. Fink and Small repeatedly emphasized the “whole portfolio” approach and pointed to structural growth areas, including private markets to insurance, private markets to wealth, digital assets, and active ETFs. Small said BlackRock believes these initiatives can each be “$500 million revenue generators in the next five years.” In insurance, Small said BlackRock manages $700 billion in AUM as the largest general account manager for insurers, across more than 450 relationships. He added that HPS manages more than $60 billion of credit assets for more than 125 insurance companies. Management said it is engaged in roughly 20 late-stage conversations to help insurers build more diversified portfolios across public and private markets, and Small said the company hopes to see deployments “pull through the second half of 2026.” In retirement, Fink said the company expects to launch its first LifePath target-date fund with private markets “later this year,” and argued that plan sponsors will need standardized benchmarking and performance data—a role he said Preqin can support. Key Q&A themes: cash, Asia, Preqin, and private credit conditions Asked about the net flow pipeline and the outlook for money market funds in a Fed-cutting environment, Small said BlackRock expects money market yields to fall and sees opportunities for investors to “lock in bond yields” in intermediate-term bonds. Fink added that cash levels may remain elevated as global capital markets grow and suggested tokenization could contribute to continued cash usage, including through tokenized money market funds. On Asia, Fink highlighted faster capital markets growth in the region, cited changes in Japan driven by NISA accounts, and reiterated confidence in the Jio BlackRock partnership in India, which he said is positioned to benefit from what he characterized as the early stages of capital markets growth there. On Preqin, Small said integration has been “terrific” and laid out priorities that include expanding distribution of data, building models and benchmarking tools for private markets, scaling the “data factory,” and pursuing the longer-term opportunity to help build private market indexing. He said BlackRock is working on investable indices that it hopes to bring to market “in the next few years.” On private credit, Small said BlackRock saw $7 billion of private credit net inflows in the fourth quarter, driven primarily by deployment activity. He said the company generally sees stable credit conditions across the main HPS strategies and characterized some negative headlines as highlighting “isolated stress points.” Small added that default rates are rising but remain within historical ranges, and said HPS has focused on lending to larger companies, noting the weighted average EBITDA in the HLEND portfolio is about $250 million. He also cited $1.1 billion of gross subscriptions into HLEND in the fourth quarter and said redemptions were 4.1%, which he described as higher than recent quarters but in line with the broader industry. In closing remarks, Fink said the company’s 2025 results “validate the power” of BlackRock’s integrated platform and that the firm enters 2026 with “differentiated momentum” and opportunities to deliver for clients and shareholders.About BlackRock NYSE: BLKBlackRock, Inc is a global investment management firm that provides a broad range of products and services to institutional, intermediary and individual investors.

Technology services and subscription revenue grew 24% year over year in both the quarter and full year, reflecting client onboarding, expansions with existing clients, and the Preqin transaction. Small said Preqin added approximately $65 million of revenue in the fourth quarter and $213 million for the full year. ACV increased 31% year over year, including Preqin, and grew 16% organically. Expense growth was also discussed. Total expense rose 19% in 2025, driven primarily by higher compensation, sales and account expense, and G&A. Employee compensation and benefits increased 20% for the year, reflecting higher incentive compensation associated with performance fees and higher operating income, as well as the onboarding of employees from GIP, Preqin, and HPS. G&A increased 15% due largely to M&A transactions and higher technology investment spend. Fourth-quarter as-adjusted operating margin was 45%, down 50 basis points year over year, and the full-year margin was 44.1%, down 40 basis points. Small said both periods reflected the impact of performance fees and related compensation. Excluding performance fees and related compensation, he said the fourth-quarter adjusted margin would have been 45.5%, up 30 basis points year over year, and the full-year margin would have been 44.9%, up 60 basis points versus 2024. On the Q&A portion of the call, management reiterated its margin framework. Small said BlackRock continues to target a “45% or greater adjusted operating margin profile,” while describing upward momentum in margins on recurring fee-related earnings. He also said that after annualizing the impact of HPS and Preqin, management expects a mid-single-digit percentage increase in G&A and expects headcount to be “broadly flat” in 2026. Record flows led by iShares and diversified channels Small reported total net inflows of $698 billion in 2025, with iShares setting a record at $527 billion. He said iShares’ flows represented 12% organic asset growth and 13% organic base fee growth, with diversified demand across core equity and premium categories such as fixed income, active, and digital assets exchange-traded products (ETPs). Fourth-quarter iShares net inflows were $181 billion. Retail net inflows were $107 billion, which Small said was led by the onboarding of an $80 billion separately managed account (SMA) assignment from Citi Wealth in the fourth quarter. He also noted record inflows at Aperio, net inflows in active fixed income, and $12 billion of alternatives inflows during 2025. Institutional active net inflows totaled $54 billion in 2025, reflecting multiple outsourcing mandates, the above-target close of GIP V, and deployment in private credit. Institutional index saw net outflows of $119 billion, which Small attributed mainly to redemptions from low-fee index equity strategies. In private markets, Small said the platform delivered $40 billion of net inflows for the year, led by private credit and infrastructure. BlackRock also reiterated its fundraising ambition, targeting $400 billion in gross private markets fundraising through 2030. BlackRock Cash Management saw $74 billion of net inflows in the fourth quarter and $131 billion in 2025, driven by U.S. government, international prime, and Circle reserve funds. Strategic priorities: private markets, wealth, insurance, and retirement Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink said BlackRock entered 2026 with “accelerating momentum” and highlighted the company’s record quarterly and annual net inflows, including $342 billion in the fourth quarter. He said the firm’s pipeline has broadened across public and private markets, technology and data, and client channels. Fink and Small repeatedly emphasized the “whole portfolio” approach and pointed to structural growth areas, including private markets to insurance, private markets to wealth, digital assets, and active ETFs. Small said BlackRock believes these initiatives can each be “$500 million revenue generators in the next five years.” In insurance, Small said BlackRock manages $700 billion in AUM as the largest general account manager for insurers, across more than 450 relationships. He added that HPS manages more than $60 billion of credit assets for more than 125 insurance companies. Management said it is engaged in roughly 20 late-stage conversations to help insurers build more diversified portfolios across public and private markets, and Small said the company hopes to see deployments “pull through the second half of 2026.” In retirement, Fink said the company expects to launch its first LifePath target-date fund with private markets “later this year,” and argued that plan sponsors will need standardized benchmarking and performance data—a role he said Preqin can support. Key Q&A themes: cash, Asia, Preqin, and private credit conditions Asked about the net flow pipeline and the outlook for money market funds in a Fed-cutting environment, Small said BlackRock expects money market yields to fall and sees opportunities for investors to “lock in bond yields” in intermediate-term bonds. Fink added that cash levels may remain elevated as global capital markets grow and suggested tokenization could contribute to continued cash usage, including through tokenized money market funds. On Asia, Fink highlighted faster capital markets growth in the region, cited changes in Japan driven by NISA accounts, and reiterated confidence in the Jio BlackRock partnership in India, which he said is positioned to benefit from what he characterized as the early stages of capital markets growth there. On Preqin, Small said integration has been “terrific” and laid out priorities that include expanding distribution of data, building models and benchmarking tools for private markets, scaling the “data factory,” and pursuing the longer-term opportunity to help build private market indexing. He said BlackRock is working on investable indices that it hopes to bring to market “in the next few years.” On private credit, Small said BlackRock saw $7 billion of private credit net inflows in the fourth quarter, driven primarily by deployment activity. He said the company generally sees stable credit conditions across the main HPS strategies and characterized some negative headlines as highlighting “isolated stress points.” Small added that default rates are rising but remain within historical ranges, and said HPS has focused on lending to larger companies, noting the weighted average EBITDA in the HLEND portfolio is about $250 million. He also cited $1.1 billion of gross subscriptions into HLEND in the fourth quarter and said redemptions were 4.1%, which he described as higher than recent quarters but in line with the broader industry. In closing remarks, Fink said the company’s 2025 results “validate the power” of BlackRock’s integrated platform and that the firm enters 2026 with “differentiated momentum” and opportunities to deliver for clients and shareholders.About BlackRock NYSE: BLKBlackRock, Inc is a global investment management firm that provides a broad range of products and services to institutional, intermediary and individual investors.

Title: Trump says he has no plans to fire Jerome Powell — after reported ‘joke’ offer of Fed chair job to Jamie Dimon

Time Published: 2026-01-15T15:25:01Z
Full Content:
President Trump said Wednesday he has no plans to fire Fed Chairman Jerome Powell despite a criminal investigation into the central banker — after reportedly offering the job to Jamie Dimon months earlier in what the Wall Street titan interpreted as a “joke.” “I don’t have any plan to do that,” Trump told Reuters in an interview Wednesday when asked if he would attempt to remove Powell from his job. Asked whether the DOJ probe gives him the power to fire Powell, Trump said: “Right now, we’re (in) a little bit of a holding pattern with him, and we’re going to determine what to do. But I can’t get into it. It’s too soon. Too early.” Months earlier, Trump had offered Dimon — the CEO of JPMorgan Chase who has supported many of Trump’s policies — the top job during a meeting in the White House, although Dimon ”took the offer as a joke,” according to the Wall Street Journal. “Until an announcement is made by President Trump, any reporting about the Federal Reserve chairman nominations process is pointless speculation,” White House spokesman Kush Desai told The Post. Powell — against whom Trump has long railed for not slashing interest rates fast enough — is currently facing a Justice Department probe over the Fed’s over-budget headquarters renovation. His term as chairman ends in May, though Powell could stay on as a member of the Fed’s board through 2028. He has so far declined to comment on whether he plans to remain on the board. Trump signaled he is looking at either former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh or National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett to replace Powell, adding that he has ruled out Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent “because he wants to stay where he is.” “The two Kevins are very good,” Trump told Reuters. “You have some other good people too, but I’ll be announcing something over the next couple of weeks.” BlackRock exec Rick Rieder and Fed Governor Christopher Waller have also been interviewed for the role. Powell — who has largely refrained from responding to Trump’s personal attacks in the past — spoke out against the federal investigation on Sunday, arguing it is motivated by politics. “No one — certainly not the chair of the Federal Reserve — is above the law. But this unprecedented action should be seen in the broader context of the administration’s threats and ongoing pressure,” Powell said in a Sunday statement.

Never miss a story. “The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the president,” he added. Foreign central bank leaders, former US government officials and current American lawmakers across the political spectrum have blasted the investigation and raised alarms about installing a Fed leader who could potentially threaten the bank’s independence. Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC), a member of the Senate Banking Committee’s slight GOP majority, on Sunday threatened to block any of Trump’s candidates for the Federal Reserve after news of the investigation broke. Dimon also said that “anything that chips away” at the Fed’s independence “is probably not a good idea.” Trump responded on Tuesday that Dimon “probably wants higher rates, maybe he makes more money that way.” “I don’t care,” Trump told Reuters when asked to respond to criticism from lawmakers who will have to vote through his pick to lead the Fed. “They should be loyal. That’s what I say.” As for broader criticism from foreign investors and economists, Trump repeated, “I don’t care.” “A president should have something to say” about decisions out of the Federal Reserve, Trump told Reuters. “I made a lot of money with business, so I think I have a better understanding of it than Too Late Jerome Powell.” The president has ramped up pressure on the Fed to slash interest rates in an attempt to help Americans feel better about the economy — as voters rank affordability a top issue ahead of this year’s midterm elections. The central bank issued three quarter-point cuts last year, lowering the target range to 3.5% to 3.75%. Along with attacks on Powell, whom Trump has called “stupid” and “crooked,” the White House has pushed Fed Governor Lisa Cook to step down, accusing her of mortgage fraud. Cook called those allegations “baseless.” Meanwhile, Stephen Miran — Trump’s economic adviser who stepped into a seat vacated by Adriana Kugler — will see his term on the Fed board expire in January. There are also rumors about potential retirements from the board, such as Vice Chair Philip Jefferson. Federal prosecutors are investigating Powell over his testimony last summer about the central bank’s renovations. Last month, Trump threatened to sue Powell for “gross incompetence,” claiming the cost of the project had run up to $4 billion — roughly $1.5 billion over budget. On its website, the Fed attributed spending increases to unexpected costs of materials and labor, more asbestos than anticipated and toxic contamination in the soil. It added the project will “reduce costs over time by allowing the Board to consolidate most of its operations.” Advertisement

Title: Wall Street steadies as Big Tech bounces back and oil prices ease
URL: https://www.bostonherald.com/2026/01/15/stock-market-big-tech-bounce/
Time Published: 2026-01-15T15:15:04Z

NEW YORK (AP) — Wall Street steadied on Thursday as stocks in the artificial-intelligence industry bounced back following an encouraging report from a Taiwanese chip giant and as oil prices eased sharply. The S&P 500 rose 0.3% and snapped the two-day losing streak it had been on since setting an all-time high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 292 points, or 0.6%, and the Nasdaq composite rose 0.2%. Nvidia and other formerly high-flying AI stocks helped lift the market after Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., a major supplier to the industry, reported a stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. TSMC also said it could boost its investment in equipment to $56 billion this year to take advantage of the AI boom. The frenzy around AI has already sent Nvidia and other superstar stocks to dizzying heights, but that stirred criticism that their prices had shot too high. Nvidia was one of the heaviest weights on the S&P 500 Wednesday after sinking 1.4%. But it rose 2.1% after TSMC Chief Financial Officer Wendell Huang said it’s seeing “continued strong demand” in an encouraging signal for the entire AI industry. TSMC is a crucial player as a major supplier for Nvidia and other giants and as a key customer for ASML and other providers. TSMC’s stock that trades in the United States rose 4.4%, while ASML’s U.S.-listed stock rallied 5.4%. Other chip-related companies helped lead the U.S. stock market, including gains of 7.7% for KLA Corp. and 5.7% for Applied Materials. Also helping to calm financial markets was a sharp easing in oil prices. A barrel of benchmark U.S. crude sank 4.6% to $59.19, while Brent crude, the international standard, dropped 4.1% to settle at $63.76 per barrel. Analysts pointed to comments from President Donald Trump, who said Wednesday afternoon that he heard “on good authority” that plans for executions in Iran have stopped amid widespread protests against the country’s leadership. Financial markets took that as a signal that tensions flaring above some of the world’s largest oil deposits could ease, which in turn could lower the possibility of a disruption to the flow of oil. Gold’s price edged back 0.3% in another signal of potentially calming nerves across financial markets. Earnings reporting season for big U.S. companies continued to pick up pace, meanwhile, with several more big financial companies delivering their results for the last three months of 2025. BlackRock, the giant that’s now overseeing more than $14 trillion in investments, rose 5.9% after reporting stronger profit and revenue than analysts expected. Morgan Stanley climbed 5.8% after likewise delivering stronger profit and revenue than expected. Goldman Sachs rose 4.6% after the investment bank topped analysts’ forecasts for profit but fell short on revenue. Outside of earnings, Boston Scientific fell 4% after announcing it‘s buying Penumbra, whose products help remove blood clots, in a cash and stock deal valued at roughly $14.5 billion. Penumbra’s stock jumped 11.8%. In the bond market, Treasury yields rose following encouraging reports on the U.S. economy. One said fewer workers applied for unemployment benefits last week in an indication that the pace of layoffs may be slowing. Other reports, meanwhile, said manufacturing was significantly stronger in the mid-Atlantic region and in New York state than economists expected. The yield on the 10-year Treasury climbed to 4.17% from 4.12% just before the release of the reports. It was at 4.15% late Wednesday. The stronger-than-expected data on the U.S. economy helped stocks of smaller companies to lead the market. Their profits can be tied more closely to the strength of the U.S. economy than their bigger, multinational rivals, and the Russell 2000 index rose 0.9%. All told, the S&P 500 rose 17.87 points to 6,944.47. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 292.81 to 49,442.44, and the Nasdaq composite gained 58.27 to 23,530.02. In stock markets abroad, indexes were mixed across Europe and Asia. South Korea’s Kospi jumped 1.6% for one of the world’s bigger moves. AP Business Writers Chan Ho-him and Matt Ott contributed.

Share this article In its fourth-quarter earnings release on Thursday, BlackRock announced that total assets under management surged to $14 trillion by the end of 2025, spurred by a record $698 billion in annual net inflows. BlackRock’s shares (BLK) rose 5% following the report, per Yahoo Finance. Digital assets AUM stood at around $78 billion at year-end, with $35 billion in full-year ETF inflows for the category, while private markets AUM climbed to $323 billion following the HPS acquisition. “BlackRock enters 2026 with accelerating momentum across our entire platform, coming off the strongest year and quarter of net inflows in our history,” CEO Larry Fink said in a statement. Fink said that the unified BlackRock platform is expanding client activity across public and private markets, technology, and data, with a broadening pipeline and strong fundraising positioning the firm to scale private market initiatives and emerging channels like digital assets and tokenization. “BlackRock is at the forefront of some of the largest new growth channels across the industry – from private markets to wealth and 401(k), to active ETFs, to private markets data, to digital assets and tokenization,” he noted. BlackRock also reported that organic base fees grew 12% annualized in Q4, reflecting strength across iShares ETFs, systematic active equities, private markets, outsourcing, and cash management. The firm posted a 19% increase in full-year revenue, driven by strong markets, 9% organic base fee growth, transaction-related fees, and higher technology services and subscription revenue.

Title: Watch this key level in the bond market for signs of an inflationary shock to stocks, BlackRock chief Larry Fink says

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Larry Fink is eyeing one number in the bond market: 5%. That's the key threshold for the 10-year US Treasury yield that could tell signal when a stock correction could be on the way, the BlackRock CEO said. Speaking to CNBC on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum on Thursday, Fink said he saw a potential scenario where inflation fears cause the 10-year yield to enter the 5% to 5.5% range. If it surpasses that threshold, it could spark a repricing for stocks, he added. "I have scenarios where it could be pretty bad," Fink said of his outlook for markets. "There's a probability we could see the 10-year over 5%, maybe even 5.5%. That would shock the equity market. That would not be a good scenario," he added, though he said that the scenario wasn't his base-case. The threshold that Fink flags has been tested several times in recent years, usually with a negative reaction in stocks following close behind. Yields in the US and globally have been volatile but have risen over the years thanks to issues like inflation, tariffs, and rising debt and deficits making investors nervous. The 10-year US Treasury yield hovered around 4.1% this week, up more than 300 basis points over the last five years, rising from record-low levels during the pandemic as the economy entered a new era of elevated inflation. Part of the latest uptick in yields has been a "sell America" sentiment that has settled over markets amid investor fears of waning Fed independence, which could potentially cause a spike in inflation down the road. That trend appears to have accelerated in recent days amid renewed geopolitical pressures and new initiatives from President Donald Trump to lower borrowing costs for Americans, which have only raised fears that inflation could rise down the line. Fink added he saw the Treasury yield curve steepening in virtually every scenario going forward. "There is a scenario where we're going to have much more elevated interest rates because of inflation. And that's going to have a very negative impact on the equity market, and it's going to change — it's going to force a revaluation," he added of stock prices. How bonds will move in the near future depends on the delicate balance between growth and inflation, Fink said. He pointed to the billions in private capital being poured into the AI trade, which could boost economic growth, but also rev up consumer prices. Jump to

Title: BlackRock is now $14 trillion after a record-breaking year. The firm has an ambitious fundraising plan for 2026.

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. What does the world's biggest asset manager that just raised the most capital in a single year in company history do as an encore? Raise more money, of course. BlackRock now runs $14 trillion, thanks to nearly $700 billion in net cash that flowed into its investment products last year, according to financial results released Thursday. The manager's iShares ETF franchise alone brought in $181 billion in net new money in the fourth quarter of 2025, a record for the division. "It's not the biggest are getting bigger — it's the best are getting bigger," boasted CFO Martin Small on the company's earnings call Thursday. To maintain the pace, CEO Larry Fink and his team outlined the firm's "ambitious 2026 fundraising plan," which will focus on a range of products, including private markets, target-date funds, active ETFs, and international retirement savers. Private investment vehicles have been a focus for Fink for years, and 2026 will be the first full year with private-credit player HPS, infrastructure investor GIP, and private-market-data provider Preqin all under the BlackRock umbrella after their acquisitions in recent years. The firm's goal for new private market assets is $400 billion by 2030, and one key client group for the firm is insurance companies, Fink said. The manager is currently in "late-stage conversations" with close to 20 insurers about a range of private market offerings. But the firm's private market strategy extends down to retail and retirement savers. The manager plans to launch the first target-date fund with private market exposure later this year, Fink said, and the industry is watching the Department of Labor to see if private assets will be allowed in 401(k) plans, as many asset managers have hoped for over the years. Fink said the firm's sales and distribution team, which he called the largest in the industry, is getting HPS products in front of financial advisors at wirehouses such as Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch. "The opportunity ahead is inspiring," Small said. BlackRock also sees plenty of room to grow internationally. Fink and his executive team mentioned Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America as places that were once "exporters of capital" but are now building their own capital markets and investing. Fink highlighted the firm's direct-to-consumer retirement offering in India and pension funds and insurers in Japan as examples of international opportunities from individual savers to institutions for BlackRock to scoop up assets. "BlackRock is going to grow as long as the world's capital markets grow," Fink said. And while the firm has certainly moved beyond its roots as a fixed-income specialist, Fink highlighted the growth of BlackRock's bond investment products, including the active ETF managed by Rick Rieder, the firm's chief investment officer of global fixed income, which trades under the ticker BINC. For 2025, fixed-income ETFs attracted $159 billion in net new money, only $9 billion less than core equity offerings, despite stock funds managing significantly more capital. "We're positioned ahead for new, great opportunities," Fink said. Correction: January 15 — This article has been updated to correct the attribution to Martin Small in the second reference. Jump to

Title: How Do We Break through the Veil of Hatred? “The Vast Majority of People in the US Want Peace”
URL: https://www.globalresearch.ca/break-through-veil-hatred/5912367
Time Published: 2026-01-15T14:38:34Z

People in the USA are currently fascinated and enchanted by 19 Buddhist monks. On October 26 last year, the red-robed sandal wearers set off from Fort Worth, Texas, on a nearly 4,000-kilometer peace march through the American South. Their destination: the US capital, Washington, D.C. The brave monks do not want their marathon march to be seen as a political demonstration, but rather as a pious pilgrimage with the goal of enlightenment. Nevertheless, this march has a political dimension. On their way through the southern states, they are greeted by ever-growing crowds of people who welcome them joyfully[1]. The people on the side of the road are so happy to finally be able to be peaceful and nonviolent again in a completely brutalized world[2]. And when observing these scenes of peacefulness, most viewers cannot help but feel a certain emotion. Once again, it is clear that the vast majority of people in the US want peace. While the president deliberately escalates the spiral of violence, many ordinary Americans refuse to participate in this madness. The brave monks from the Huong Dao Vipassana Bhavana Center in Texas have proven to be extremely skilled at self-promotion. They are active on social media. Aloka, a former Indian street dog, serves as a visual representation of this peaceful pilgrimage, so to speak. Members of the order brought him to the US from a pilgrimage through India. Aloka bravely ran the routes at the beginning. Then the dog had a traffic accident and was treated by veterinarians. Aloka has his own Facebook page[3]. There, veterinarians reported on his operation, which was met with great sympathy from the American population. The recovering dog now runs a few kilometers every day. He travels the rest of the way by car. Perhaps he will be able to cover the entire route again by the time he reaches Washington. Two monks were also injured. A truck accidentally drove into the accompanying vehicle of the monks’ demonstration. One monk was so badly injured that his leg had to be amputated[4]. He is now continuing the long journey in a wheelchair. The pious order from Texas is a branch of Theravada Buddhism, which is predominant in Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Cambodia, and Vietnam. And so the Texan Theravada monks not only want to make a pilgrimage for peace, but also to raise money for a huge temple complex in Texas. Anyone who, like the author of these lines, has visited all these Theravada states knows that the poverty of the population corresponds to the gigantic Buddhist temples, which are covered with gold plates instead of shingles. The simple believer can improve his karma by buying the gold plates that adorn the roofs of the pagodas with his meager money. Compared to the Shwedagon Pagoda in Yangon, Myanmar, St. Peter’s Basilica looks like a poorhouse[5]. Our devout brothers in Texas know how to combine peace with a passion for lavish architecture. Nevertheless, the devout pilgrimage is wonderful. And sometimes this pilgrimage does take on an explicitly political character. For example, when the monks reach the city of Selma in Alabama and cross the Edmund Pettus Bridge there. This is where the so-called Bloody Sunday took place in March 1965[6]. Civil rights demonstrators, black and white, crossed this very bridge. Some of them died as a result of brutal police violence. Even back then, people were marching. For the civil rights of Black people and Jews. The massacre in Selma, Alabama, caused great outrage in the US, fueled the civil rights movement, and mobilized white students and pupils for the protests of the late 1960s. The pilgrim monks and the citizens of Selma and Huntsville who marched with them paused to pay their respects to the civil rights activists[7]. The parallels to that time are evident everywhere. However, thanks to the Trump presidency, a much harsher wind is now blowing from Washington. The companions of the devout peace pilgrims are also aware of this. Perhaps such a supposedly apolitical meditation tour through the southern states is a kind of paradoxical intervention. After all, US citizens are being provoked to white heat by Trump’s terror troops, the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE for short. This shock troop has been around since the days of George Bush the Dumb. Its job is to track down illegal immigrants and remove them from the country. Under Trump, the terror is increasingly directed against the normal population in the US. Like locusts, up to two thousand ICE thugs invade peaceful towns and commit all kinds of violent crimes without any legal authority. Just recently, a 37-year-old mother of three was shot at close range in her car by an ICE killer[8]. Citizens are also forming observation watches. The governors and mayors of the affected cities and states are announcing their vigorous resistance to the illegal attacks by ICE paramilitary gangs. It is no longer unreasonable for authorities and communities to distance themselves more than before from the US federal government. Part of the strategy, cynically calculated by shock strategist Trump, is to ensure that the people in the communities under attack are unable to find peace and remain under constant stress. These are, so to speak, regime change methods on the home front. In doing so, an oligarch like Trump, who has always been rich, seems to forget that it is ordinary people who create the wealth on which Trump and his neo-feudal parasite caste rest so comfortably. Are workers, employees, and farmers no longer needed? Is the plan to replace these people with robots and artificial intelligence? Trump visited a Ford car manufacturing plant. A worker called Trump a “pedophile.” Trump gave him the middle finger and shouted, “Fuck you!”[9] This is how direct contact between the rich and the people who create wealth looks today. It’s disgusting. There’s war everywhere. Not just on the Eastern Front. But also at home. A war that people out in the country don’t want. We all want to be left in peace by these disturbed violence fetishists. Maybe we should organize a peace pilgrimage march in Germany too? * Click the share button below to email/forward this article.

Title: “It is not IF, but When will Trump bomb Iran?” “Greenland Will Not be Free”. America is in Stage Five of Collapse
URL: https://www.globalresearch.ca/america-stage-five-collapse/5912350
Time Published: 2026-01-15T13:54:07Z

It is not IF, but when will Trump bomb Iran? Given he is scheduled to be at the World Economic Forum January 18th, the ego would be inclined to brag what a great warmonger he is before the biggest and baddest attendees present. With protests ongoing, it is difficult to see how he would escape murdering civilian Iranians while forcing the Ayatollah to flee. It also ventures into the cosmos – how much destruction and devastation will be forthcoming before an Israeli Prime Ruler is installed. So far, Americans are on the end feed of massive tariffs. We are going to shell out $100+ billion to rebuild the oil infrastructure in Venezuela. And we will be tabulating some $500 to $750 billion to rebuild Gaza and the West Bank. Meanwhile, Trump is thinking about making Rubio president of Cuba, and the Federal Reserve Chair a BlackRock appointee who will smile warmly while destroying the last vestige of what was America. And then there is the $500 billion increase for Pentagon funding. Greenland will not be free. There are only 93 miles of road in all of Greenland making infrastructure for mining rare earths and gold relatively impossible. New ports would need to be developed. Electricity generation is minimal with blackouts periodically occurring. All machinery and equipment would have to be imported. Labor would be imported. The list is nauseatingly long! Like Venezuela, it is likely Trump would have to print more deficit money to even begin any projects which could take years to a decade to become feasible. The full bankruptcy of America would seem to leer its monstrous head from the White House. Because everything Trump is proposing will never come to fruition in his lifetime. In addition, all his dreams of fairyland could be quashed with the Supreme Court decision which was scheduled for today – and has been pushed ‘again’ for a later date. Which leads me to believe we are missing something. A Pattern: In 1590, Spain was the richest empire on earth controlling over half the gold and silver and their military was a dominant force across Europe – within 80 years they were bankrupt and never recovered. In 1918, Britain ruled the largest empire in history, within 40 years their currency collapsed and they became a vassal of America. Empires exhaust themselves with debt and a collapse of their currency hegemony. Always following the same pattern of rise–war–ego–currency rupture and defeat. The stages of an Empire’s fall: Always collapsing from internal economic failure, always following the same script. “I will take down America without firing a shot.” It is questionable whether America’s gold reserves exist. Our manufacturing base has collapsed. Trade is becoming ever more sparse as Trump makes America noncompetitive and continues the spiral of trillion dollar deficits. While these failed empires collapsed after Stage 5, the US hasn’t. By sheer resilience! Call in the cleaners! Trump and Israel. To effectuate Stage 6 and 7 for a complete decay: Stage 6 is where we are today when other countries no longer rely on America’s fiat paper money. BRICS are moving back to gold and silver. The Middle East is recognizing alternate currencies. And with Israel at Trump’s helm, the war machine is now overextended and pushing toward a complete failed empire. Bombs in one year: Sudan, Nigeria, Somalia, Russia, Iran, Venezuela, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Lebanon, and Iran again. This is not coincidental. The takedown of America is the end game. And the lizards have no intention of rebuilding ‘robust economies.’ That would be the Illusion. There is no real money to prop us back up. Trump is now resorting to outright stealing to keep us running until the final decay which will be economic and agricultural collapse sending crime out of control. The same pattern over and over. As the economy collapses, citizens emigrate – those who stay fight for any remaining goods. When visiting the Detroit Auto factory yesterday, the manager informed Trump he had over 5,000 positions he couldn’t fill. Trump’s response, “Buy robots.” The number of farm bankruptcies in 2024 were 55% higher than 2023. The number in 2025 is higher than 2024. Agriculture has a low margin for survival. Trump’s response? Import beef from Argentina. Trump’s policies are NOT about making America Great. They are about feeding the 7 stages of collapse as led by bankers. Money-changers. Debt. Every single scenario throughout history providing the blueprint. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article. Follow us on Instagram and X and subscribe to our Telegram Channel.

Title: IPO boom times are back, with SpaceX and OpenAI on investors’ 2026 wish list. But be careful what you buy
URL: https://fortune.com/2026/01/15/ipo-boom-stock-market-nvidia-blackrock-spacex-openai-investing/

In 1999, stock buyers had a cornucopia of new options as U.S. companies went public at a near-record clip. The crop included names like Nvidia and BlackRock that, for those who purchased them on the first day of trading, have delivered spectacular long-term returns. Now the IPO market is heating up again. While 2026 will almost certainly not match the banner year of 1999, which saw 476 companies go public, investors should have far more choices than they did four years ago, when just 38 firms held an IPO. Those likely to debut this year include the giants SpaceX and OpenAI. “We’re going to see some companies go public that are going to be defining the American technology and economic landscape for the next decade,” says Matt Kennedy, senior strategist at Renaissance Capital. All of this is enticing for investors hoping to get in early on the next Microsoft or Google. But, as history shows, there is plenty to give pause to those looking to pounce on first-day share offerings. Jay Ritter is a soft-spoken emeritus professor at the University of Florida who has acquired the nickname “Mr. IPO” for his exhaustive research on initial public offerings. His data shows that new offerings go on to beat the overall market in some years, but in other years the opposite is true—particularly in years that produce a bumper crop of IPOs. While shares in Nvidia proved a winner, that wasn’t the case with the overall class of 1999 IPOs. That year, in fact, saw newly public companies deliver three-year returns of -48%. The number is especially sobering given that Ritter’s metric measures from the first-day closing price (which is almost always higher than the official offer price), and excludes nonconventional IPOs like reverse mergers. For those tempted to dismiss this as ancient history—many members of the IPO class of 1999, after all, got clobbered by the dotcom crash—2021 provides another cautionary tale. That year saw a flood of 311 companies go public—the most in 20 years—but the three-year returns they collectively delivered came in at -49%. The reason for this is not particularly surprising. “When every IPO is popping, that’s when you see deals thrown together in a hurry,” says Kennedy, noting that smaller, unprofitable companies that would ordinarily not make the cut can pull off an IPO in such a climate. He adds that investors face a further challenge during IPO bull markets because even strong companies are prone to listing at hard-to-justify valuations, increasing the odds of a future slump. The upshot is that IPO boom times offer investors more opportunities, but also a lot more chances of a misstep. Meanwhile, companies that go public during lean years are more apt to be built to last. 19% $1.19 trillion Over the years, the path to going public has also shifted. According to Ritter, companies that debuted in the 1980s and 1990s were typically younger than today’s IPO entrants, but also more likely to be profitable. Surprisingly, though, Ritter says that profitability at the time of an IPO is not a big predictor of future success. He says that company sales are far better indicators, and firms that have $100 million or more in annual revenue are more likely to perform well over the long term than those that do not. Any investor who has sought to purchase a newly listed stock has likely encountered a familiar frustration: Even if they seek to buy right when the stock lists, the price they see from their brokerage is higher than the official listing price. This occurs because the banks that underwrite the stock offer the listing price to large clients, leaving retail investors to scramble for shares on the open market. Those who want a better price can do so by getting in even earlier—via a private sale or during a company’s pre-IPO “road show”—but that’s easier said than done. According to Glen Anderson of Rainmaker Securities, which brokers private-share transactions, it’s possible to get hold of shares of firms like SpaceX or OpenAI, but it typically requires an investment of $250,000 or more. But for the vast majority of investors who will acquire shares on the open market, timing can still play a role. There is no upside to seeking to purchase a stock right when it lists, says Kennedy of Renaissance, adding that it can even be a good idea to buy it at the end of the day or on the day after the IPO. To get a true sense of a stock’s value typically requires waiting considerably longer for the dust to settle. Ritter makes the case that a newly public company’s first earnings report is not particularly helpful, noting that analysts and corporate executives are heavily invested in delivering results in line with expectations—meaning a firm will take any steps necessary to do so. He says a company’s true investment potential will become clearer after six months, which is when insiders are allowed to sell their shares—after which the share price will reflect the company’s fundamentals more than IPO hype. All this said, the next Nvidia is likely out there among this year’s IPO crop, and for those who want to try to buy it on its debut day, the best approach is still old-fashioned research, says Anderson. “You can press the buy button right at the opening for every new stock,” he says. “Or you can do the homework and see what a stock is really worth relative to its comps and valuation, and wait for the price you want. Otherwise, you are just rolling the dice.” This article appears in the February/March 2026 issue of Fortune with the headline “IPO boom times are back—but be careful what you buy.”

How much fibre do you need? What are good sources of it? And should you purchase food with added protein? Lorraine Cooney, gut health and IBS dietitian at Blackrock Health and author, joins me on this week’s episode of the Real Health podcast. Fibre is a type of carbohydrate found in plant foods that the body cannot fully digest. Instead of being broken down for energy, fibre passes through the digestive system and helps keep it working properly. It adds bulk to stool, which supports regular bowel movements and helps prevent constipation. Fibre also feeds beneficial gut bacteria, supporting gut health and immunity. I asked the dietitian ‘do we get enough fibre in Ireland?’ She explained, “We are dramatically deficient in fibre in Ireland. We should aim for 30 grams a day, but I think that's maybe even a minimum. A lot of the studies would recommend 50 grams. Our ancestors would have consumed 100 grams. We're at around the 18 grams in Ireland.” You can listen to the full episode here or wherever you get your podcasts.

Title: Joe McCarthy ‘gutted’ for brother Paddy after ‘significant’ injury in Leinster-La Rochelle classic

No sooner have Joe and Paddy McCarthy belatedly been able to put a run of games together than the brotherly partnership has been cruelly interrupted. Alas therefore, the boyhood dream of playing together for Ireland will also have to be suspended for the time being as well. The extent of Paddy McCarthy’s absence has yet to be revealed after he sustained a “significant” foot injury when slipping awkwardly in tackling Will Skelton in Leinster’s drama-fuelled 25-24 win over La Rochelle. However, he is out of Leinster’s Champions Cup pool finale against Bayonne in the Stade Jean Dauger on Saturday (kick-off 4.15pm local time/3.15pm Irish) and the start of the Six Nations, which kicks off on Thursday, February 5th when France host Ireland in Paris. “Yeah, it doesn’t look great, to be honest,” admits the elder brother a little forlornly. “It looks like it’s not going to be a quick turnaround so gutted for him because he was on a roll, he’s had a great start to the season. More so from our team perspective, we’ll really miss him over the next few weeks and months. I’m going to miss playing with him. I won’t have him as a roomie over in Bayonne this weekend.” Although they both came through Blackrock College and Trinity, the brothers hadn’t played together until Paddy won his fourth Leinster cap as a replacement away to the Dragons in November 2023. The only other occasion was in Leinster’s festive win over Munster last season in Limerick, when Joe started and Paddy was again a replacement. Although Paddy (22) broke into the Irish team to feature in all four November internationals, Joe (24) was still sidelined by the foot injury which cut short his Lions’ tour. They were then re-united in Leinster’s wins over Ulster and Munster in December, when Joe started and Paddy again finished, so it wasn’t until Leinster’s Champions Cup opener at home to Harlequins that the pair finally started together. This happened again away to Leicester, when Joe attributed his Man of the Match display to his younger brother. “I loved it. It actually really spurs me on. He’s an absolute beast and I love playing with him, he really motivates me to play well.” Of course, siblings are understandably more motivated when playing alongside each other. In light of last Saturday’s third start together the older McCarthy reflected: “It was really cool because we never really got a run of games together up to that because one of us would always be injured or he would be with the 20s or whatever. “I think we definitely play better together and preparing for the game together. I really enjoy playing with him. It lifts my game and I think his as well.” That said, McCarthy readily sings the praises of Jerry Cahir for his performance off the bench after replacing his younger brother in what proved to be a memorable Champions Cup debut. “It’s such small margins,” said McCarthy in reflecting on that win. “Way better feeling coming in (on Monday) with a win, it makes everything a lot better” while admitting the result “doesn’t paper over the cracks”. “We definitely weren’t perfect. There were a lot of areas we actually felt we were quite poor in so it’s getting that balance right. I felt we deserved the win, we dug it out and found a way, but trying to fix what we can.” Both brothers play on the edge, and Leinster have collectively received 23 penalties in their last two games as well as three yellow cards − with the older McCarthy receiving two of them. McCarthy could feel his yellow card last Saturday for an immaterial offside was quite harsh, although he admits they are avoidable, whereas the breakdown is becoming jungle warfare. “Even in the La Rochelle game they were really pushing boundaries and you are wondering: ‘How are they getting away with that?’ It’s tough for referees. They’re not going to get them all right, but there are some turnovers where I felt ‘I was good there’ and you didn’t get the call or the ref didn’t see it or the guy comes up the side. “I pride myself on the maul and sometimes I feel I’ve come through the middle and I’ve been told to leave it or saying it’s a tackle not a maul. That happens a lot. The last few weeks have been hard because there was a good bit of grey area there. We always say if you paint good pictures around the ruck, make good dominant carries, on the front foot and clearing bodies off their feet, it usually clears it up. Obviously you can’t do it every time.” This Saturday’s second successive fixture against Top 14 opposition should prove “ideal preparation” for that Six Nations opener, as well as providing something novel. “Even when the fixtures came out everyone was really excited about this one. Before the World Cup we played Samoa there. It was a bit of a cagey game, but the atmosphere was class because there were a lot of French fans at that game. “You hear about it being one of the best atmospheres in the Top 14 so we’re really excited about it. We seem to play a lot of the same teams, like a Leicester and a La Rochelle, so a new team like Bayonne is always good.” Mindful of Bayonne’s “unbelievable” home form, McCarthy said: “They can’t qualify now but they are a proud team and they will show up for the fans. One thing we looked at from the La Rochelle game was that every French team likes to offload in contact, they don’t want it to break down. We probably didn’t deal with that so well because maybe in the URC teams are more pragmatic. “Bayonne have good athletes and they will want to keep the ball alive. They won’t want us to get a ruck set so they will look to play through us and offload.

Gig workers prepare to deliver orders outside Swiggy's grocery warehouse at a market area in New Delhi, India, May 6, 2024. (Photo: Reuters/Priyanshu Singh) NEW DELHI: Walmart's Flipkart, Swiggy and IPO-bound Zepto have stopped promoting their grocery businesses as "10-minute" delivery services following an order by the Indian government that was spurred by concerns over road safety. The move is a major setback for the quick commerce sector which has become a US$11.5 billion market in India within five years and changed how Indians shop, with apps allowing groceries and electronics to be delivered within minutes. Still, rash driving by riders and low pay have dogged the sector, a darling of foreign investors, prompting the labour ministry to ask some companies during a private meeting on Saturday (Jan 10) to stop using the "10-minute" branding. It was not clear if there would be any penalties for non-compliance. Eternal's Blinkit changed its branding on Tuesday, and Zepto, Swiggy, and Walmart's Flipkart have followed suit to drop the fast delivery promotion, their apps showed on Wednesday.

More Info Investors continue to bet on the AI boom, but this year they see energy and power providers as the most compelling opportunities to increase exposure to the AI theme, the world’s biggest asset manager, BlackRock, said in its 2026 Investment Directions report this week. Respondents in a recent survey of hundreds of BlackRock clients believe in the AI theme and its value, but they are seeking to diversify in and around AI, expanding their exposure beyond the Magnificent Seven, hyperscalers, and Big Tech. More than half—54%—of BlackRock’s survey participants believe that energy providers are the most compelling opportunity to increase exposure to the AI theme this year. A total of 37% responded in the multi-select question that infrastructure would be the most compelling opportunity around AI, and just 20% see the U.S. mega-cap tech giants as the most compelling play in AI. That’s not to say that investors are backing off from the AI boom, as only 7% believe the AI theme is a bubble. They just seek greater diversification around the hottest theme in the markets in recent years. And power supply, with energy providers, is the biggest growth opportunity, according to BlackRock’s survey of clients. “As investors look to build exposure to the AI theme, interest is broadening from core AI technology to the wider ecosystems underpinning it,” BlackRock said in its report. “In our recent survey, clients highlighted energy and power providers as the most compelling opportunity, amid accelerating AI-driven power demand.” Investors, therefore, have started to bet on the most critical bottleneck in the AI boom—the soaring electricity demand to power the data centers. “Today’s US market is historically concentrated – but the earnings outlook isn’t. With the rest of the S&P 500 expected to catch up to the Magnificent 7 in EPS growth through 2026, it’s increasingly important to risk-manage mega cap and AI exposure while also capturing differentiated upside opportunities,” Ibrahim Kanan, Head of Core US Equity, Fundamental Equities, at BlackRock, noted in comments to the report. The global AI race is also an energy race, as AI is highly energy-intensive, according to the world’s biggest asset manager. Goldman Sachs Research, for example, expects data center power demand to surge 175% by 2030 compared to 2023 levels. This jump in electricity demand would be the equivalent of adding another Top 10 power-consuming country. The investment bank continues to see the reliability of power and water as “a multi-year investment theme amid rising demand growth, aging infrastructure and Adaptation to extreme temperatures/weather events,” Goldman’s analysts wrote in an October report. “We continue to see attractive investment opportunities across the power supply chain driven by power demand growth acceleration — in the US, to levels not seen since the 1990,” Goldman Sachs says. So big is the demand that the aging grid infrastructure in key regional U.S. markets cannot cope with all requests, with grid investments lagging behind soaring power demand. At the current rate of interconnection requests and grid capacity, the U.S. could face a power crunch by 2030, Samantha Dart, Goldman Sachs’ co-head of global commodities research, said at a conference earlier this month. Goldman Sachs research analysts said in an October report that data center power demand growth alone would accelerate total U.S. power demand growth through 2030 by 1.2 percentage points to an overall level of 2.6%, the highest growth in America’s electricity demand since the 1990s. “We aren’t adding enough capacity,” Dart said this week at the Goldman Sachs Energy, CleanTech and Utilities Conference in Miami, adding that if the issue remains unaddressed, the U.S. could lose the AI race with China.

Title: The Fed–Trump battle is rattling crypto markets: Bitcoin caught in the crossfire

Bitcoin looks strong. but technical indicators suggest something else may be brewing. For years, the crypto market followed a simple rule wherein lower interest rates usually push asset prices higher. But as 2026 begins, a major political clash is showing that liquidity alone isn’t enough. Tensions between the Trump administration and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell have grown into a serious institutional conflict. This has put crypto in a rare push-and-pull situation. On one side, the administration’s strong pro-crypto stance and push for lower rates should, in theory, be bullish for Bitcoin [BTC] and digital assets. On the other hand, the attack on the Federal Reserve’s independence has unsettled large institutional investors like BlackRock and Fidelity. Adding fuel to the fire, The Kobeissi Letter posted about President Trump’s recent remarks, where he said, “When the market goes up, they [Fed] should lower rates.” In his view, the Federal Reserve isn’t protecting stability but rather holding the economy back just as growth picks up. Talking about the impact this will have on the crypto market, Farzam Ehsani, CEO of cryptocurrency exchange VALR, said, ” The very fact of a criminal investigation against the current Fed chairman appears to be a tool of pressure, signaling a deep rift within the American establishment.” Ehsani added, “For the crypto market, the situation is paradoxical.” He highlights that Bitcoin is currently acting as both a safety net and a speculative gamble. On one hand, investors are buying it as a hedge because they are losing trust in a politically pressured U.S. dollar, viewing decentralized code as more reliable than government-controlled policy. On the other hand, the sheer chaos of this legal battle is scaring big institutional players into selling risky assets to protect their cash. Therefore, the next move depends entirely on who wins. If Powell holds his ground, the market will likely stabilize and return to normal trends. But if the White House successfully forces interest rates down to 1%, a wave of cheap money could trigger a massive rally for both Bitcoin and Gold. Echoing similar sentiments, Ray Youssef, CEO of crypto app NoOnes, noted, “A rate cut could increase market liquidity, which would positively affect cryptocurrency growth. Perhaps this expectation is driving gold and Bitcoin higher amid red indices, making them not just assets but a refuge from chaos.” Youssef believes that in today’s market, Bitcoin is playing a confusing double role. On one hand, it is rising alongside gold as a safety net for investors who are losing faith in the U.S. dollar due to the intense political battle between the White House and the Federal Reserve. On the other hand, the threat of global conflicts is making big institutional players nervous, causing them to sell off risky assets during U.S. trading hours. Yet despite the uncertainty, the total crypto market value has held up well, rising 3.22% in the past 24 hours to $3.24 trillion. The Fear and Greed Index sits at 52, or neutral, showing that investors are not fully confident yet, as per CoinMarketCap. At the same time, many crypto assets are entering overbought levels, raising the risk of a short-term pullback. Still, analysts are suggesting the Justice Department’s probe into Powell could ultimately drive investors toward safe havens like gold and emerging alternatives such as Bitcoin.

Title: Bloomberg Analyst Urges 4-Year Bitcoin HODL Strategy as BitWise Survey Reveals Surging Institutional Demand

Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said the current market data suggests investors should hold Bitcoin for at least 4 years. The remarks came amid an influx of Wall Street institutions into the crypto space, as a survey by VanEck reveals that 99% of financial advisors will likely maintain their positions in 2026. In an X post, Balchunas noted that the “boomers” who recently ventured into crypto are unlikely to sell in the near term, as they likely have a long-term HODL strategy. Therefore, any investor buying Bitcoin should consider holding it for at least 4 years. “The boomers are not tourists. Which is smart imo. If you’re going to buy btc data shows you should commit to at least a four-year holding period, like a self-imposed lock-up period,” he said. Balchunas was responding to an X post by BitWise CIO Matt Hougan, who noted that nearly all the financial advisors who dipped their toes in crypto in 2025 will likely continue to do so in 2026. In the survey, 57% of financial advisors said they plan to increase their allocation to crypto in 2026, while 42% plan to maintain their positions. Meanwhile, only 1% of financial advisors said that they would reduce their positions. Balchunas’s remarks come as Wall Street doubles down on crypto. Currently, nearly all the top financial institutions in the US, including BlackRock, Fidelity, Charles Schwab, and Morgan Stanley, are dipping their toes into the crypto space. The Bitwise survey comes in the wake of surging inflows into multiple crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that are currently available in the US. As ZyCrypto reported, spot Bitcoin ETFs had their best day in three months after amassing more than $750 million in inflows on January 13. The surging inflows coincided with a rise in Bitcoin’s price above $95,000, marking its biggest daily close since October. Other crypto ETFs also amassed significant inflows. Ethereum saw $129 million in inflows, while XRP ETFs saw $12.98 million in inflows. Meanwhile, Solana spot ETFs amassed $5.91 million in inflows during the day. Hence, as financial advisors plan to maintain or increase their crypto allocations this year, the Bitcoin price could be set for significant gains.

The proposed investment of up to ₹580 crore will be split between a secondary share purchase of about ₹381 crore from Groww’s parent entity and a primary capital infusion of nearly ₹199 crore into Groww AMC, the filings showed. The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals. As part of the deal, State Street Investment Management will acquire up to 23 per cent of Groww AMC’s fully diluted share capital. Despite this, the US-based asset manager will hold less than 5 per cent of the voting rights in the mutual fund arm. Post-transaction, Groww AMC will cease to be a wholly owned subsidiary of Billionbrains Garage Ventures Ltd, the listed parent of the Groww platform. Groww entered the mutual fund business in 2023 after acquiring the asset management company from Indiabulls, marking its formal foray into the asset management space. Since the acquisition, the company has expanded its product offerings amid a sharp rise in retail participation in capital markets and growing adoption of mutual funds among first-time investors. “India stands out as a market of immense opportunity, with a rising middle class, favourable demographics, and a rapid shift toward embracing modern investment products,” said Yie-Hsin Hung, chief executive of State Street Investment Management. “Our partnership with Groww AMC allows us to participate directly in the growth of India’s domestic asset management market, deliver a range of investment exposures to a broader population, and build a pipeline of Indian exposures for global distribution,” she added. Welcoming the investment, Groww said the partnership would help deepen its asset management capabilities. “State Street Investment Management is one of the world’s largest asset managers, and we are delighted to welcome them as an investor and strategic partner in Groww AMC,” said Harsh Jain, co-founder and chief operating officer of Groww. “This partnership will enable us to bring global best practices and sophisticated investment products to Indian investors, strengthening our long-term commitment to building a world-class asset management platform in India,” he added. State Street’s entry into India’s mutual fund space comes amid growing global interest in the country’s asset management industry. The move follows a similar push by rival BlackRock, which recently formed a joint venture with billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s Jio Financial Services Ltd to tap into India’s expanding domestic savings and investment market.

Investing Stocks were walloped on Tuesday after JPMorgan missed analysts’ fourth-quarter earnings estimates. The good news on Tuesday was the December consumer price index report that showed inflation hitting the 2.7% target, while core inflation came in below estimates at 2.6% Investors will be watching the other big banks that will report this week after the somewhat worrisome JPMorgan print. Sending You to Google News in 3 © Thinkstock Futures are trading lower after the January rally hit a wall on Wednesday, with all major indices falling, and the selling looks set to continue today. The main culprit yesterday was JPMorgan (NYSE: JPM) shares, which took a hit after missing analyst estimates for the quarter. The banking giant posted $4.63 per share, below the expected $4.86, primarily due to a surprise decline in investment banking fees and costs associated with the Apple Card portfolio. Revenue slightly beat expectations, and trading and net interest income showed strength, making it a mixed report. That noted, the bank was priced to perfection, so the sellers traded on the print, especially after Jamie Dimon warned of risks. The Dow Jones Industrials took the biggest shot Tuesday, closing down 0.88% at 49,191, led by JPMorgan’s decline. The S&P 500 closed 0.19% lower at 6,963, while the Nasdaq finished 0.10% lower at 23,709. The Russell 2000, which has been on a roll in 2026, closed at 2,632, down 0.11%. Yields were mixed across the Treasury curve on Tuesday, with buyers leaning to the middle and longer maturities, while there was some selling in the short-term T-bills. The positive news on inflation overshadowed the feud between President Trump and Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell, as well as the Justice Department’s subpoenas. The 30-year-long bond finished trading on Tuesday at 4.83%, while the benchmark 10-year note was last seen at 4.18% Energy stocks were the big winners as prices were higher across the energy complex on Tuesday. Prices for the major benchmarks rose primarily due to escalating geopolitical tensions surrounding Iran, with concerns about potential supply disruptions outweighing increased supply prospects from Venezuela following President Trump’s threat of a 25% tariff on countries trading with Iran, which could start impacting global supply routes. Brent Crude finished the session at $65.38, up 2.36%, while West Texas Intermediate closed at $61.02, up 2.55%. Natural gas ended the day flat at $3.42. After a solid rally to start the day and new record highs, Gold reversed midday and ended the day 0.25% lower at $4,586. The likely reason for the slight pullback was profit-taking. Still, sales were limited by ongoing geopolitical tensions with Iran and by uncertainty surrounding the Trump administration’s new investigation into the Fed. The weaker-than-expected US inflation report also supported expectations of potential Federal Reserve rate cuts, which typically benefit gold and will likely do so going forward. Silver continued to march higher, finishing the day at $86.80, up 1.95%. The cryptocurrency market saw broad gains, with major assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum rising, supported by positive regulatory news and resumed institutional inflows, as the overall crypto market capitalization rose back over $3.2 trillion. Senator Tim Scott released a draft of the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act, which aims to provide more explicit rules for digital assets, and that was perceived positively by traders. At 8A EST, Bitcoin traded at $94,990, while Ethereum was quoted at $3,293. 24/7 Wall St. reviews dozens of analyst research reports daily to identify new investment ideas for both investors and traders.

UPDATED 08:00 EST / JANUARY 14 2026 by Duncan Riley JumpCloud Inc., which offers a unified platform for identity, access and devices, today unvieled new artificial intelligence capabilities to fuel safe innovation by allowing organizations to accelerate AI adoption and ensure compliance and control for all types of identities. JumpCloud’s new features are designed to allow organizations to see, secure and automate AI management and to allow them to focus on proactive information technology enablement and safe innovation. The company says the approach gives organizations a competitive edge and helps them stay compliant. The new capabilities provide control and intelligent IT foundations that are necessary for managing AI usage across the entire enterprise. Using the new capabilities, organizations can securely integrate all their AI tools and speed up their path to success. Key benefits include the ability to automatically detect shadow AI usage and hidden machine identities. Organizations gain centralized insights into who is using what, where and with what data risks. Users can also find data instantly, the company says, including surfacing critical data with natural language to navigate the platform. The capabilities include zero trust for AI agents, with support for managing machine-to-machine and AI-to-resource access via a unified policy. A complementary AI Admin Assistant streamlines day-to-day operations by handling high-frequency administrative tasks through conversational intelligence. Other features include the ability to generate rapid, reliable scripts that cut down the time and effort needed to write or debug scripts and integration with existing AI tools. “The market has been selling fear of AI, pushing organizations to simply ‘detect and block’ new technologies,” said Joel Rennich, senior vice president of product management at JumpCloud. “We believe that stifles progress. By using our platform, AI becomes an engine driving immediate efficiency across the organization. We are enabling the natural human desire for efficiency — user-led innovation — safely, turning a corporate liability into a source of competitive advantage.” The company was previously in the news on Jan. 8 when it announced that it had acquired MacSolution Tecnologia Ltd., the largest managed service provider in the Americas and an existing JumpCloud partner, for an undisclosed price. JumpCloud is a venture capital-backed startup that has raised $408 million across ten rounds, including a Series F round of $159 million on a $2.65 billion valuation in September 2021. Investors in the company include Sapphire Ventures, BlackRock Inc., Blue Owl Capital Inc., Whale Rock Capital Management, Sands Capital Management, Endeavor Catalyst GP, General Atlantic, H.I.G. Growth Partners, Owl Rock Capital, NTT Docomo Ventures Inc., CrowdStrike Holdings Inc., Atlassian Corp. PLC, Waterman Ventures, OurCrowd Ltd. and STEADFAST Capital Ventures.

Title: Ireland to experience more extreme weather - expert

Ireland will experience more flooding events and extreme weather events unless it transitions away from fossil fuels, Met Éireann climatologist Paul Moore has said. It comes as the European Union Copernicus Climate Change Service confirmed that 2025 was the third warmest year on record. Speaking on RTÉ's Today With David McCullagh, Mr Moore said: "The higher the temperatures go, the more extreme events that we can expect." He said the 1.5C level of global warming above pre-industrial levels threshold was laid out so that it was deemed possible we could keep under to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. "That hasn’t happened, so we are continuing towards that trend at an accelerated rate. The higher the temperatures go, the more moisture that can hold in the atmosphere. "That means more flooding events and more extreme weather events for us," Mr Moore said. "Unless we can bring them (greenhouse gas emissions) down to zero emissions or to net-zero emissions, then the temperatures will continue to rise. "It is putting out the call to get our act together globally and to bring down emissions so we can stop this trend," Mr Moore said. Mr Moore said the forecaster did some rapid attribution studies with Maynooth University’s ICARUS Climate Research Centre called the 'WASITUS’ study, which he said found that Wexford rainfall due to Storm Claudia was made 12% heavier because of a warming climate and that it is twice as likely. He added that a study done for last summer showed that it was the warmest summer on record in Ireland and was 40 times more likely to be a record-breaking summer in terms of temperature than pre-industrial times. "What once was a 600-year event is now a one in 15-year event, due to the warming climate," he said. He said the positive drawn from the report is that the technology is out there for us to "transition away from fossil fuels". "That is the positive as long as we do it," he said. Technology improving, says public policy advisor Meanwhile, public policy advisor Oisín Coughlan said it [climate change] "has been coming faster than the models predicted than when we hoped when we signed the Paris Agreement". He reiterated Mr Moore’s point on the technology that is out there, which he said has "improved hugely over the last ten years". Solar is now the cheapest way to make electricity everywhere in the world, he said. He stressed that the "technology has really moved but the politics has got worse". "I really think the next five years is actually a battle between the technology and the politics. The politics needs to catch up with the technology," he said. Mr Coughlan said these positives are cheaper electricity, less dependence on Russian or other fossil fuels leading to warmer homes and lower fuel bills. However, he said "getting there is the challenge". He said the Government needs to do a lot more for people on the expense of the retrofit process and to work with groups that are in touch with those in energy poverty. "We have to be much more proactive about how we do this and we need to accompany people through what is a challenging process, but the outcome will be very positive," Mr Coughlan said. He said removing our reliance on fossil fuels is in our own "national interest" and not about "some whimsical environmental desire". Mr Coughlan said 20 years ago it was hard to make people interested in climate change in Ireland. "Now we are seeing it, Storm Éowyn, the floods in Midleton, the floods in Wexford last year. We all know that the rain now is more intensive bursts... and the warmer summers and the warmer nights… we are seeing it here," he said. On infrastructure, Mr Coughlan said "our country isn’t built for the climate that we are moving into". "So as well as cutting pollution and saving money, we also do need to start the adaption, the coping of what is about to come," he said. © RTÉ 2026.
