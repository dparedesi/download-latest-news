October 24, 2024 02:00 ET | Source: Alliance Witan PLC Alliance Witan PLC Alliance Witan PLC (the “Company”) LEI: 213800SZZD4E21OZ9W55 Portfolio Update: Alliance Witan completes portfolio transition, brings in EdgePoint for Black Creek Alliance Witan’s investment manager, Willis Towers Watson (“WTW”), is pleased to announce the completion of the transition of assets from Witan Investment Trust (“Witan”) to Alliance Witan following shareholder approval for the combination of Alliance Trust and Witan on 9 October. Blackrock Inc. has helped to manage the transition and keep the costs to a minimum. While Blackrock was completing the transition of assets, WTW took the opportunity to also make a manager change, replacing Black Creek Investment Management (“Black Creek”) with EdgePoint Wealth Management (“EdgePoint”). The appointment of EdgePoint follows that of Jennison Associates, previously one of Witan’s investment managers, which was announced at the start of the transition just over two weeks ago. EdgePoint, based in Toronto, is an employee-owned business, founded in 2008. It manages $25bn of client assets, as of 30 June 2024, and seeks to buy good, undervalued business and hold them until the market fully realises their potential. With the portfolio realignment now completed, the new manager allocations are as follows: The resulting risk profile of the portfolio is largely unchanged, with no excessive exposure relative to the benchmark to regions, sectors or styles, and most of the added value is expected to come from stock selection. The direct costs of the portfolio transition and manager changes, including BlackRock’s fee, trading commissions, tax and bid/offer spreads, will be less than 0.04% of the Alliance Witan portfolio, representing fair value for shareholders. Craig Baker, Chief Investment Officer of WTW and Chair of the Alliance Witan Investment Committee, said: “We would like to express our appreciation to the team at Black Creek for their contribution to the Company since their appointment in 2017. While we continue to rate Black Creek highly, a senior member of the team left in the last 12 months on health grounds, and we have been evaluating succession planning for some time. While Bill Kanko has no specific retirement date in mind and there are other experienced investors at the firm, we have taken the opportunity to switch to a manager in which we have high conviction, and which brings a fresh perspective to the new, combined portfolio. Baker added: “Now that Witan’s assets are fully invested, it is business as usual. We will be using the same proven investment approach we have always used for Alliance Witan, although we will be retaining a small number of Witan’s discounted investment trust holdings, which represent less than 3% of the portfolio, until such time that they can be sold at an attractive price for shareholders.” Ends About Alliance Witan (ALW) Alliance Witan aims to deliver long-term capital growth and rising income from investing in global equities at a competitive cost. Our investment manager blends the top stock selections of some of the world’s best active managers into a single diversified portfolio designed to outperform the market while carefully managing risk and volatility. Alliance Trust is an AIC Dividend Hero with 57 consecutive years of rising dividends https://www.alliancewitan.com For more information, please contact:

Title: Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN): Revolutionizing Delivery with Record Speed and Prime Benefits

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 7 Best Delivery Stocks To Invest In Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against other best delivery stocks to invest in now. The delivery and courier industry is diverse, encompassing a wide range of services that connect businesses and consumers through various shipping methods. Parcel delivery services are a major component, with companies offering both domestic and international shipping options, driven by the rise of e-commerce. Another significant segment is food delivery platforms. These platforms connect hungry customers with local eateries, creating a new business model that thrives on convenience. Overall, the delivery industry is evolving rapidly, with diverse players working to meet the growing expectations for speed and reliability in shipping services. According to Zion Market Research, the global on-demand delivery market was valued at $15.19 billion in 2023. Looking forward, the market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 20.90% during 2024-2032 to reach $83.82 billion by ​the end of the forecast period. In 2023, the Asia-Pacific region led the market in revenue and is projected to maintain its dominance throughout the forecast period. Read Also: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In This growth is fueled by increasing consumer expectations for fast and reliable delivery services, particularly same-day and next-day options. Experts highlight that the demand for quick deliveries has led to substantial investments in last-mile delivery solutions and advanced technologies, such as automation and artificial intelligence (AI). In 2024, consumers have continued to prioritize free and fast shipping for their online orders, according to recent data from Digital Commerce 360 and Bizrate Insights. A survey of 1,013 online shoppers revealed that 81.34% consider free shipping their top priority when receiving deliveries. Fast shipping follows closely, with 68.41% of respondents highlighting its importance. Additionally, 55.68% of consumers emphasized the need for retailers to keep products in stock and ready to ship. AI and automation are key trends that are significantly transforming the delivery services industry, making operations more efficient and responsive to consumer demands. For example, companies like DHL Express have introduced the DHLBot in Singapore and South Korea. The DHLBot is an AI-powered robotics arm that can sort over 1,000 small parcels per hour with 99% accuracy. This technology not only speeds up the sorting process but also reduces labor costs and minimizes errors, allowing for quicker deliveries. As the industry evolves, it is clear that AI and automation will play a crucial role in shaping the future of delivery services. Methodology To compile our list of the 7 best delivery stocks to invest in now, we used the Finviz and Yahoo stock screeners to find the largest delivery companies. We also reviewed our own rankings and consulted various online resources. From an initial pool of more than 20 delivery stocks, we focused on the top 7 stocks most favored by institutional investors. Data for the hedge fund sentiment surrounding each stock was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 912 elite hedge funds. The 7 best delivery stocks to invest in now are ranked in ascending order based on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them as of Q2 2024. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 308 Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a major American technology company known for its extensive e-commerce platform, which offers a wide variety of products ranging from books to electronics. The company has grown to become the world’s largest online retailer and a leader in cloud computing through its Amazon Web Services (AWS). A key aspect of its business is its delivery services, which include fast shipping options like Amazon Prime, allowing members to receive their orders quickly through same-day delivery, one-day delivery, and two-day delivery service options. The company’s innovative logistics network continues to redefine online shopping and delivery experiences globally. At the end of July, Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) announced a remarkable achievement in its delivery service, reporting that over 5 billion items have already been delivered the same or next day globally this year, marking a 30% increase from the previous year. This record speed not only benefits Prime members by allowing them to receive products faster but also supports small and medium-sized businesses, with many of these deliveries made on behalf of independent sellers using the company’s Fulfillment by Amazon service. Since the launch of Prime in 2005, the selection of items eligible for free Prime shipping has expanded from just one million to over 300 million, with tens of millions available for Same-Day or One-Day Delivery. This means that Prime members now enjoy 20 times more options delivered much quicker than before, enhancing the overall value of their membership. In November 2023, The Wall Street Journal reported that Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) surpassed UPS in parcel volume in 2022 and surpassed FedEx in 2020, with expectations that this lead will continue to grow based on internal Amazon data. Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is actively enhancing its services to provide even greater value to its Prime members, which makes it an attractive delivery stock to consider. In the first half of 2024, the company achieved record delivery speeds and this rapid delivery is supported by an expanded selection of products, including popular brands like Aéropostale and Kiehl’s. Additionally, Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) now offers US Prime members a Grubhub+ membership, valued at $120 a year, and has launched grocery delivery subscriptions that allow unlimited deliveries for a low monthly fee when shopping at the company’s fresh stores in the US and the UK. Moreover, Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is leveraging advanced technology, including AI-powered features like the shopping assistant Rufus, to improve customer experience. The company has also expanded its pharmacy services, providing Medicare members access to essential medications for just $5 a month. These strategic initiatives combined with the company’s focus on speed, selection, and added value position Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) as a strong contender in the delivery market. According to Insider Monkey’s database, AMZN has gained significant interest from institutional investors, with the number of hedge fund holders increasing to 308 in Q2 2024, up from 302 in the previous quarter. Overall, AMZN ranks 1st on our list of best delivery stocks to invest in now. While we acknowledge the potential of delivery companies, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Chainlink nears breakout: Is LINK’s surge to $50 coming?

Time Published: 2024-10-24T04:00:42Z

Chainlink nears breakout, boosted by whale activity and expanding real-world asset integration. Chainlink [LINK] neared a potential breakout as it approached a critical point in the market. At press time, LINK was trading within a falling wedge pattern on the weekly timeframe, and many traders anticipated a significant upward movement soon. These developments could push LINK’s price higher as it became an even more vital player in the crypto world. Looking at recent price action, Chainlink has gained around 0.5% over the past week. However, the last 24 hours saw a decline of 5.6%. Despite the short-term losses, LINK’s trading volume surged by over 10%, with approximately $290 million changing hands. The volume-to-market-cap ratio sat at 4%, indicating sufficient liquidity to support continued trading activity. As LINK moves toward a possible breakout, all eyes are on the $15 level. If LINK can break and hold above this resistance, it could trigger a rally that targets $50 by next year. Source: TradingView LINK is currently trading below the 50-day moving average, and flipping this level could reignite bullish momentum. Traders are closely watching for this signal, as it could confirm a breakout from the falling wedge pattern. If the breakout occurs, LINK could see a strong move higher, making it a top contender in the crypto market during the final quarter of the year. Large trades and whale orders are offering further clues about LINK’s future direction. On the K-line chart, large trades appear as circles, with the size representing the trade amount. Whale orders are marked by horizontal lines, with Chainlink’s big orders concentrated around the $11 zone. These trades suggest that large investors are positioning themselves for a move higher, as whales typically accumulate when they expect a price increase. The longer these orders remain unfilled, the more likely it is that they will drive LINK’s price higher. Source: Coinglass Chainlink’s expansion into real-world assets (RWA) and artificial intelligence (AI) is also setting the stage for a significant price boost. Chainlink’s role as a provider of secure oracles for smart contracts positions it perfectly for the upcoming tokenization of RWAs. As major financial players like BlackRock explore tokenizing stocks, bonds, and real estate, Chainlink could become a central infrastructure for these assets. Read Chainlink’s [LINK] Price Prediction 2024–2025 This integration could absorb massive amounts of liquidity into LINK, further driving its price higher. Chainlink is at a pivotal moment. If LINK holds key support levels and breaks above $15, the sky may be the limit.

Title: Is Blue Bird Corporation (BLBD) the Best EV Stock to Buy Right Now?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 8 Best EV Stocks To Buy Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Blue Bird Corporation (NASDAQ:BLBD) stands against the other EV stocks. After a swift rise in the EV industry over the years, we saw a slowdown in its progress, especially in Europe and the USA. Nevertheless, it is just a matter of time before the technology takes over the traditional internal combustion engines (ICE). While the growth has been slowing in the western part of the world, China has been working tirelessly to become the global leader in the EV industry. In a podcast episode of Everything Electric Show on October 20, Ford CEO Jim Farley discussed the ongoing transformation in the automotive industry. He noted that while EV adoption continues to grow worldwide, significant changes have occurred regarding market dynamics. He emphasized China's dominance in EV production, with 70% of global EVs manufactured there. A rapidly expanding sub-segment in China is electric vehicles with extended range (e-rev), which use a small combustion engine to power the batteries for longer trips. This shift is reshaping global supply chains, brand preferences, and jobs, with geopolitical factors further influencing the industry's future. Farley noted that these changes have become clearer over the past year. We also discussed the country’s dominance in our article about small-cap EV stocks to invest in. Here is an excerpt from the article: “While the growth in the US and Europe is slowing down, China is picking up a significant pace and dominating the EV landscape. According to a World Economic Forum report, Chinese EVs are much cheaper than their Western counterparts, with an average price of $34,400, compared to $55,242 in the U.S. The price gap is driven by lower labor costs, favorable government subsidies, and more affordable battery sourcing.

The United States government acknowledges the potential of EVs in the future of mobility and is trying its best to push for its development. On July 11, the Department of Energy (DOE) announced $1.7 billion in grants aimed at converting 11 auto plants in eight states to produce electric vehicles and components. Reuters reported on October 22 that U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm announced that the DOE is working quickly to finalize $1.7 billion in grants. The funds include $500 million for GM’s Michigan plant and $334.8 million for Stellantis’ Belvidere plant, with additional funds for the latter’s Indiana facility. According to another Reuters report from September 23, Monroe Capital LLC announced plans to launch the Drive Forward Fund LP, aiming to raise up to $1 billion to provide loans to smaller auto suppliers transitioning from internal combustion engine vehicles to EVs. The White House supports this initiative, emphasizing that it will offer affordable capital to help small and medium-sized auto manufacturers refinance, grow, and diversify and will benefit over 250,000 workers. Moreover, new U.S. tariffs on Chinese EVs and stricter emissions regulations are pushing automakers to adapt their supply chains. Monroe CEO Ted Koenig highlighted the fund's importance in cultivating growth and innovation among suppliers struggling to secure financing for EV production. Our Methodology For this article, we identified over 30 EV manufacturers using the Finviz stocks screener and narrowed our list to 8 stocks most widely held by institutional investors. The stocks are listed in ascending order of their hedge funds which was taken from Insider Monkey’s Q2 database of 912 elite hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A group of school buses lined up in front of a large building, painted in bright colors. Number of Hedge Funds Holders: 24 One of the best EV stocks, Blue Bird Corporation (NASDAQ:BLBD) is an American manufacturer of school buses, specializing in low and zero-emission models. Its lineup includes traditional school buses, pupil activity buses, and specialized vehicles like security buses, ambulance buses, and blood donation buses. The company is committed to innovation and safety and transports around 25 million children daily. It currently operates over 20,000 low and zero-emission buses, including those powered by propane, natural gas, and electricity. In August, the company celebrated a milestone by delivering its 2,000th electric, zero-emission school bus. For the third quarter of fiscal 2024, Blue Bird (NASDAQ:BLBD) reported net sales of $333.4 million, representing a 13.3% increase from $294.3 million in the same quarter of the previous year. This growth was driven by changes in product mix, price adjustments due to rising inventory costs, and a slight uptick in unit bookings. Bus sales rose by $37.8 million, supported by a 13.2% increase in the average sales price and a 0.7% rise in booked units, despite ongoing supply chain challenges. Parts sales also saw a $1.3 million increase due to inflation-driven price hikes. Although the total cost of goods sold rose to $264.0 million, it improved as a percentage of net sales from 84.5% to 79.2%. Operating profit reached $39.7 million, significantly up from $19.4 million in the same quarter last year, thanks to a $23.6 million rise in gross profit, despite increasing operating expenses. On October 9, The Fly reported that BTIG initiated its coverage on Blue Bird (NASDAQ:BLBD) with a Buy rating and a price target of $55. The company ranks among the top three manufacturers of school buses and holds a strong position in the alternative fuel school bus market. According to the firm’s analyst, while Blue Bird also sells traditional diesel buses, it focuses on providing value rather than just selling a high volume of these buses. Despite the stock having doubled in value over the past year, BTIG remains optimistic about the company. It anticipates growth in the North American school bus market and expects a continued shift toward alternative fuels, which could help the company gain more market share. Overall BLBD ranks 6th on our list of the best EV stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of BLBD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than BLBD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 8 Best EV Stocks To Buy Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NIO Inc. (NYSE:NIO) stands against the other EV stocks. After a swift rise in the EV industry over the years, we saw a slowdown in its progress, especially in Europe and the USA. Nevertheless, it is just a matter of time before the technology takes over the traditional internal combustion engines (ICE). While the growth has been slowing in the western part of the world, China has been working tirelessly to become the global leader in the EV industry. In a podcast episode of Everything Electric Show on October 20, Ford CEO Jim Farley discussed the ongoing transformation in the automotive industry. He noted that while EV adoption continues to grow worldwide, significant changes have occurred regarding market dynamics. He emphasized China's dominance in EV production, with 70% of global EVs manufactured there. A rapidly expanding sub-segment in China is electric vehicles with extended range (e-rev), which use a small combustion engine to power the batteries for longer trips. This shift is reshaping global supply chains, brand preferences, and jobs, with geopolitical factors further influencing the industry's future. Farley noted that these changes have become clearer over the past year. We also discussed the country’s dominance in our article about small-cap EV stocks to invest in. Here is an excerpt from the article: “While the growth in the US and Europe is slowing down, China is picking up a significant pace and dominating the EV landscape.

(NYSE:NIO) specializes in premium smart electric vehicles and is renowned for its innovative battery swapping technology and Battery as a Service (BaaS) model, which offers flexible battery subscription options. The company's vehicle lineup includes various SUVs and sedans. The company operates in China and several European countries, with plans for further global expansion, which is supported by its research and development centers located in important areas worldwide. It takes the 7th spot on our list of best EV stocks. In July 2023, NIO (NYSE:NIO) introduced a significant advancement in battery technology, a 150 kWh semi-solid-state battery that extends driving ranges to approximately 930 kilometers (578 miles) on a single charge. The technology combines the high energy density of solid-state batteries with the practicality of traditional lithium-ion batteries, which improves vehicle performance and allows current owners to upgrade their battery packs for improved range. In Q3, the company achieved a new high with 61,855 vehicles delivered, marking an 11.6% growth from the previous year. In September alone, NIO (NYSE:NIO) delivered 21,181 vehicles, a 35.4% increase from the same month last year. This total includes 20,349 vehicles from its premium brand and 832 from its newly launched family-oriented brand, ONVO. The ONVO brand introduced its first model, the L60, a mid-size smart electric SUV, on September 19, with deliveries beginning shortly after. With over 2,552 battery swap stations established in China, the company is positioned as a distinctive player in the EV charging and battery market. Overall NIO ranks 7th on our list of the best EV stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of NIO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Technological advancements continue to shape the future of esports. The integration of generative AI in gaming is creating more immersive experiences, while cloud gaming continues to gain traction.

Additionally, the Middle East is emerging as a significant market for esports, thanks to initiatives like Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030, which aims to diversify the country’s economy. Major events, such as the Esports World Cup held in Riyadh, have drawn thousands of participants and substantial prize pools, showcasing the region's potential. Here’s a short excerpt from our previous article “7 Best Gaming Stocks To Buy Now” that discusses this in more detail: “In July and August, the first-ever Esports World Cup took place in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, attracting over 1,500 players and offering a massive prize pool of $60 million.

Photo: Frank McGrath The Great Irish Oyster Revival is well and truly underway. I love the fact that the delicious bivalves are everywhere now, and that it’s a rare restaurant which doesn’t offer some kind of dressed oyster as a snack. But most places get their oysters from a single source, via a seafood supplier, and the majority offer just one type of oyster at a time. Not so at Sea Shanty in Blackrock, which buys its oysters direct from the farms and, on the night we visit, is offering a choice of oysters from Cromane in Kerry, Killough Bay in Co Down, Woodstown Bay in Co Waterford, Cooley in Co Louth, Connemara in Co Galway and Achill in Co Mayo. The only other place you’ll find Cromane oysters is Allta, and Sea Shanty is the sole Irish stockist of Killough Bay’s, and the only Dublin outlet for the oysters from Woodtown Bay.

As the cryptocurrency market emerges from a prolonged seven-month consolidation phase, following a parabolic uptrend for Bitcoin and various altcoins in the first quarter of 2024, crypto analyst OxNobler has boldly declared that today marks the start of the next significant altseason. In a recent post on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter), OxNobler shared insights on the Altcoin Indicator, which has just gone parabolic for the first time in three years. The analyst emphasized the cyclical nature of market phases, driven by capital inflows that shift from Bitcoin into larger-cap tokens before eventually reaching lower-cap altcoins, suggesting a growing liquidity movement that could fuel significant price surges across the altcoin landscape. Identifying key catalysts for the upcoming liquidity inflows, OxNobler pointed to several factors: the upcoming US election, where both candidates express support for Bitcoin, anticipated Federal Reserve rate cuts, the potential lifting of the cryptocurrency ban in China, and the expected payout of $16 billion from FTX in Q4 2024 to Q1 2025. By analyzing historical price movements and market cycles, OxNobler believes traders can position themselves for substantial gains in the months ahead. OxNobler has highlighted several altcoins that he believes are primed for growth in this new market phase.

Institutions' substantial holdings in Cochlear implies that they have significant influence over the company's share price A total of 25 investors have a majority stake in the company with 45% ownership Insiders have bought recently If you want to know who really controls Cochlear Limited (ASX:COH), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 51% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company. Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait. Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Cochlear. View our latest analysis for Cochlear Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index. Cochlear already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Cochlear's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters. Institutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Cochlear is not owned by hedge funds. BlackRock, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 7.2% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 7.1% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 5.7% by the third-largest shareholder. On studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest. While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future. While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it. Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances. Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Cochlear Limited. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own AU$74m worth of shares (at current prices). It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. With a 48% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Cochlear. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run. It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Cochlear better, we need to consider many other factors. I like to dive deeper into how a company has performed in the past.

Title: ECB’s Anti-Bitcoin Propaganda Debunked In Scathing Academic Rebuttal
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/ecb-anti-bitcoin-propaganda-debunked/
Time Published: 2024-10-23T22:00:04Z
Full Content:
As a response to the latest anti-Bitcoin paper by the European Central Bank (ECB), a new academic paper titled “Challenging Bias in the ECB’s Bitcoin Analysis” has been published. Authored by Murray A. Rudd, along with co-authors Allen Farrington, Freddie New, and Dennis Porter, the paper offers a comprehensive critique of a recent working paper by ECB officials Ulrich Bindseil and Jürgen Schaaf. Dennis Porter, CEO and founder of Satoshi Action Fund, who initiated the paper with a few days announced the publication on X, stating, “₿REAKING: Full Academic Rebuttal to the anti-Bitcoin ECB paper officially published.” The original ECB paper by Bindseil and Schaaf portrays BTC as a speculative asset with limited intrinsic value and significant risks. It criticized BTC’s volatility, lack of productive contribution, and wealth concentration, while advocating for Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) as a superior solution for modern financial systems, as Bitcoinist reported. The rebuttal systematically addresses and refutes the key assertions made by Bindseil and Schaaf: Bindseil and Schaaf argue that the industry’s lobbying exerts disproportionate influence, skewing regulatory policy in its favor. The rebuttal counters this by highlighting the decentralized nature of Bitcoin. “not have a CEO, legal or marketing departments, or lobbyists: it is a neutral, global, leaderless protocol. Bitcoin advocates typically operate without the institutional backing enjoyed by the corporations that dominate the crypto industry,” the authors write. They point out that traditional financial institutions spend far more on lobbying than the nascent industry noting that in 2023, crypto-related lobbying expenditures in the US constituted less than 1% of financial sector lobbying expenditures. Addressing the claim that ownership is highly concentrated among a small number of large players, the rebuttal emphasizes that this view overlooks the widespread dispersion of BTC holdings. “Institutional and exchange wallets represent the holdings of diverse investors rather than single entities,” the authors explain. They note that many of the largest wallets belong to exchanges like Coinbase and Binance, as well as ETF issuers like BlackRock and Fidelity, who hold BTC on behalf of millions of users. The authors also challenge the notion that wealth concentration in coins is inherently unfair. “They imply that any form of inequality is unjust, yet fail to explain why this applies—a free market for Bitcoin has been available to all since its inception,” they write. “Unlike the vast majority of cryptocurrency tokens (‘altcoins’), Bitcoin had a fair and public launch. There was no pre-launch distribution of Bitcoin, no ‘founder shares,’ and no venture capital backers purchasing Bitcoin at a discount.” The ECB paper asserts that BTC’s rising price creates positive consumption effects for holders but does not increase overall productivity or economic growth. The rebuttal disputes this by highlighting BTC’s significant role in driving financial innovation and efficiency. “Bitcoin functions as a technological protocol, similar to the TCP/IP protocol that underpins the Internet, enabling the development of new financial services,” they argue. The authors also emphasize the impact in developing regions, particularly in the remittance market. “For countries that derive a large proportion of their GDP from remittances, slashing transaction costs could have dramatic impacts among the poorest households, who are traditionally excluded from banking services,” the paper notes. Bindseil and Schaaf suggest that Bitcoin’s price appreciation results in wealth redistribution, benefiting early adopters at the expense of non-holders and latecomers. The rebuttal counters that this argument disregards the voluntary nature of BTC markets, where participants freely choose to enter based on their own assessment of the asset’s potential. “Like early investors in stocks or venture capital, Bitcoin’s early adopters assumed significant risk in exchange for potentially high returns—an inherent feature of markets for emerging technologies,” they explain. They also highlight the broader implications of inflation, which redistribute wealth from savers to debt holders through inflationary policies. “Bitcoin’s fixed supply and deflationary characteristics counteract this erosion, offering a long-term store of value,” they assert. The ECB paper claims that Bitcoin lacks intrinsic value and cannot be priced using traditional asset valuation models. The rebuttal argues that this narrow definition ignores the role that scarcity, decentralization, and utility as a store of value play in asset valuation. “Bitcoin operates similarly to gold, providing an alternative store of value, particularly in periods of monetary instability,” they state. They further assert, “Their argument is fundamentally flawed: they claim BTC cannot be considered money because it cannot be valued as a security, whereas the reality is that it cannot be valued as a security precisely because it is money.” Addressing the assertion that BTC’s price movements are indicative of speculative bubbles, the rebuttal points out that volatility is a characteristic of emerging technologies. “Bitcoin’s price appreciation is driven by its scarcity, adoption, network effects, and recognition of its utility as a hedge against fiat currency debasement,” they explain. The ECB paper contends that Bitcoin has not fulfilled its original promise as a global payment system due to high fees and scalability issues. The rebuttal counters this by highlighting technological advancements like the Lightning Network, which have dramatically improved Bitcoin’s scalability, reducing fees and increasing transaction speed. “By focusing on the early limitations, Bindseil and Schaaf fail to acknowledge the significant progress made in improving its scalability and efficiency,” they argue. They also address the authors’ critique of Nakamoto’s analysis of financial transactions, stating, “Nakamoto’s argument is not about the optionality of mediation in certain types of transactions; rather, it concerns the inherent costs and risks in a system where transactions rely on third-party credit institutions.” The authors also challenge the ECB paper’s framing of CBDCs as superior to BTC. They highlight the risks of centralization inherent in CBDCs, including concerns about privacy, political manipulation, and surveillance. “Bitcoin’s decentralized architecture ensures censorship resistance and financial sovereignty,” they assert, contrasting it with the centralization of CBDCs. The rebuttal raises concerns about potential conflicts of interest due to the authors’ roles within the ECB. Both Bindseil and Schaaf are deeply involved in developing the digital euro, a CBDC project that directly competes with decentralized digital currencies like BTC. “Their vested interest in advancing CBDCs likely skews their portrayal of Bitcoin as a speculative asset,” Porter et al. conclude. At press time, BTC traded at $66,465. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email. Jake Simmons has been a Bitcoin enthusiast since 2016.

Title: Michael Saylor reverses remarks on self-custody, calls it ‘a right for all’

Saylor said that the right to self-custody applies to all individuals and institutions, who have the freedom to choose the form of custody. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. MicroStrategy executive chair Michael Saylor backtracked on his recent remarks about self-custody and clarified that he supports it as a fundamental right. Saylor said that the right to self-custody applies to all individuals and institutions who have the freedom to choose the form of custody. He added: “Bitcoin benefits from all forms of investment by all types of entities, and should welcome everyone.” Saylor’s clarification and response come after significant backlash from leading voices in the industry for statements he made during a recent interview. Jameson Lopp, co-founder and Chief Security Officer of CasaHODL, replied that self-custody is not about being paranoid, and argued that Saylor’s stance has long-term “negative ramifications” as it convinces people to fully trust third-party custodians. Citing these negative ramifications, Lopp mentions the increasing systemic risk through centralizing BTC in fewer places and leaving Bitcoin holders out of network governance activities, such as running a node. He added: “Self-custody is not merely important to individual Bitcoin holders. It’s important for the continued strengthening and improvement of the entire network.” Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin joined the choir of voices contrary to Saylor’s statement, calling his comments “insane.” Buterin said that Saylor is arguing in favor of a narrative where trusting regulated public entities, such as BlackRock and Fidelity, might protect crypto from stringent rules and law enforcement. However, the Ethereum co-founder added that there is “plenty of precedent” for how this strategy can fail, and he does not believe that trusting entities is aligned with the crypto ethos. Other notorious Bitcoin proponents, such as Jack Mallers and Adam Back, criticized Saylor’s remarks by highlighting that self-custody is a core part of the financial freedom enabled by Bitcoin.

CareMax, Inc. (CMAX) stock has tumbled to a 52-week low, reaching a price level of just $1.5, as the company faces a tumultuous period marked by investor concerns and broader market headwinds. This latest price point represents a stark contrast to the stock's performance over the past year, with Deerfield Healthcare Tech Acquisitions, the parent of CareMax, witnessing a staggering 1-year change of -97.65%. The dramatic decline underscores the volatility and challenges within the healthcare technology sector, as well as the specific hurdles that CareMax has encountered in its operations and growth strategy. Investors are closely monitoring the company's next moves as it navigates through this low point in its market valuation. In other recent news, CareMax, Inc. has taken significant steps to manage its financial strain. The company has drawn $5 million from a loan to cover short-term operating expenses and secured a $20 million credit facility, which includes a $4 million term loan and an additional $16 million available through delayed draw term loans. Despite challenges impacting its adjusted EBITDA, CareMax met its full-year revenue targets and membership goals. In addition to these measures, CareMax has reached an agreement with its lenders, including Jefferies Finance LLC and BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) Financial Management, to extend the waiver on certain defaults under its credit agreement until various dates in 2024. This extension provides CareMax with additional time to address these defaults. Furthermore, analysts from Jefferies and UBS have adjusted their price targets for CareMax. Jefferies maintained a Hold rating but lowered the price target to $3.00, while UBS maintained a Neutral rating and revised its price target to $6.40. These are the recent developments in the company's ongoing efforts to manage its financial obligations. The recent plunge in CareMax, Inc. (CMAX) stock to a 52-week low aligns with several critical insights from InvestingPro. The company's financial health appears precarious, with InvestingPro data showing a market capitalization of just $6.29 million USD, reflecting the severe market devaluation mentioned in the article. InvestingPro Tips highlight that CMAX is "quickly burning through cash" and "operates with a significant debt burden," which may explain investors' growing concerns. The tip noting that the "stock generally trades with high price volatility" is evident in the dramatic 1-year change of -97.65% mentioned in the article. Moreover, CMAX's financial struggles are further illustrated by its negative gross profit margin of -3.31% and an alarming return on assets of -97.55% for the last twelve months as of Q2 2024. These figures suggest deep-rooted operational challenges that the company must overcome to regain investor confidence. For readers seeking a more comprehensive analysis, InvestingPro offers 12 additional tips that could provide further insight into CMAX's financial situation and market performance.

In a Wednesday report from the global investment firm, analysts Gautam Chhugani, Mahika Sapra, and Sanskar Chindalia wrote that they believe the biggest digital coin will hit $200,000 by the end of 2025. And that’s being "conservative," they said. “With accelerating institutional adoption, we expect Bitcoin to triple from here to attain a cycle-high price of $200,000 by 2025 end,” the report read. Bitcoin is now trading for just under $65,750, dropping by nearly 3% in a seven-day period. At the weekend, it was priced above $69,000 for the first time in nearly three months. The asset hit an all-time high price of $73,737 in March. Bernstein analysts had previously predicted that Bitcoin could reach $150,000 in 2025 due to the huge demand for newly approved spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S. They continued to argue in Wednesday’s report that demand for these products will push the asset higher. The ETFs—which trade on stock exchanges and allow investors to buy the digital asset through their brokerage accounts—have been hugely successful and allowed institutions such as Morgan Stanley to safely get exposure to Bitcoin. Last week, the funds—managed by Wall Street titans such as BlackRock and Fidelity—topped $20 billion in total inflows to date, despite only being approved in January. The report added that American Bitcoin mining companies and software firm MicroStrategy, which in 2020 added the cryptocurrency and now securitizes Bitcoin, would continue to rally. Such investments are used by investors to get exposure to the crypto world without owning Bitcoin. MicroStrategy is the largest corporate treasury reserve holder of Bitcoin in the world, with over $16 billion worth of BTC.

Experts highlight that the demand for quick deliveries has led to substantial investments in last-mile delivery solutions and advanced technologies, such as automation and artificial intelligence (AI). In 2024, consumers have continued to prioritize free and fast shipping for their online orders, according to recent data from Digital Commerce 360 and Bizrate Insights. A survey of 1,013 online shoppers revealed that 81.34% consider free shipping their top priority when receiving deliveries. Fast shipping follows closely, with 68.41% of respondents highlighting its importance. Additionally, 55.68% of consumers emphasized the need for retailers to keep products in stock and ready to ship. AI and automation are key trends that are significantly transforming the delivery services industry, making operations more efficient and responsive to consumer demands. For example, companies like DHL Express have introduced the DHLBot in Singapore and South Korea. The DHLBot is an AI-powered robotics arm that can sort over 1,000 small parcels per hour with 99% accuracy. This technology not only speeds up the sorting process but also reduces labor costs and minimizes errors, allowing for quicker deliveries. As the industry evolves, it is clear that AI and automation will play a crucial role in shaping the future of delivery services. Methodology To compile our list of the 7 best delivery stocks to invest in now, we used the Finviz and Yahoo stock screeners to find the largest delivery companies.

New to the strategy was the online food delivery platform and logistics provider DoorDash Inc. (NASDAQ:DASH) Since its IPO in 2021, the company’s scale has grown to entrench it with customers and consumers, though we have been cautious about its high valuation. Recently, the company reported lower-than-expected guidance for future margins and that caused its shares to sell off.

Building a Bond Ladder Barry Ritholtz: Over the past decade, or maybe even longer, No one’s accurately predicted which way rates were going. Are they going to rise? Are they going to fall? Are they going to stay steady? This creates a challenge for bond investors who are usually looking for a predictable income stream from their fixed-income holdings. One solution? Create a ladder of bonds of different maturity rates so that regardless of what occurs, you have a predictable yield series. You can lock in higher-yielding paper if rates fall, but you also free up more capital on an annual basis if rates rise, I’m Barry Ritholtz. And on today’s edition of at the money, we’re going to show you how to create a bond ladder. To help us unpack all of this and what it means for your fixed income portfolio, let’s bring in Karen Veraa. She is head of iShares US fixed income strategy for investing giant black rock. So let’s start simply by What is a bond ladder? Karen Verra: A bond ladder is a simple tool for investing in the bond market. You take your investing window, let’s say 10 years, and you equally wait every maturity across that 10 year period. So you’ve got bonds that mature in one year, two year, three years, and so on. It’s a very popular strategy because as you just mentioned, Barry, you, you don’t have to make bets on interest rate risk. You kind of have your investing horizon and you’ve got this more predictable stream of income as well as maturity is coming due each year where you can make a decision about. Going in the next rung on the bond ladder or doing something else with that money. Barry Ritholtz: We always seem to divide bond ladders into each rung is the same equity amount. What, what’s the thinking there? Karen Verra: We do see that as being the most popular. It’s because you can think through that. I’m going to have a certain amount of money. Let’s say I’ve got a hundred thousand dollars to invest and it’s a 10 year-ladder. I’ve got 10, 000 coming due each year. You can kind of think of it in chunks like that. We do see some people, who are laddering out amounts and retirement accounts, and they need to take those required minimum distributions where they will look at the IRS schedule of how much they have to pull out of the account. It’s not quite equal, but you can even ladder out those required minimum distributions. Um, you know, it’s about 8 percent instead of 10 percent in the first year, for example. And then you don’t have to sell anything inside your retirement account and you can just pull those out on schedule. So that’s another way that people weight their bond ladders when they’re seeking that goal of having those RMDs coming due every year. Barry Ritholtz: Let’s talk about what goes into bond ladders. I’m assuming a mix of US Treasury bonds, munis, investment grade corporates, even high yielding. Anything else go into the mix for bond ladders? Karen Verra: I’d say the most popular tends to be munis and corporate bonds and the investment grade side. We offer a suite of exchange traded funds that mature each year and they’re primarily used to build bond ladders. We have these in high yield as well for people who want to go out and add a little bit more income and credit risk to the portfolios. We even have them in the tips market. So these days you can build a bond ladder using all these different asset classes. I think some of the challenges with CDs is typically they’re limited in their term. They may only go out up to five years and sometimes the banks will have restrictions or penalties if you want to sell them early or try to get your money back early. So we’ve seen people migrate away from CD ladders, doing it more with bond and bond ETFs to build these ladders. Barry Ritholtz: How do investors determine what their timeline is? I think that’s a pretty interesting choice and most people just seem to assume it’s 10 years, but from what I’ve seen, there are a variety of timelines. Karen Verra: I think people can think about it if they have a liability that they’re managing to or a time based goal. Uh, we see people sometimes building ladders, let’s say three to seven years because maybe they have a cash portfolio for things the next couple of years, but then they don’t want to start their ladder out for a few years. One to five tends to be the most popular, um, based on data that we have around assets and those different account types. We rarely see people go out past 10 years. I do see people asking for 15 because I think with the bond ladder, you can accomplish most of your goals within that time horizon of having stability, having income, rolling it every year. We also see on the corporate side, corporate issues will issue 10-year bonds and they might do a 30-year bond, but there’s not really that much paper that’s actively being issued beyond 10 years. So what tends to happen is there’s just not that many new issues and it’s hard to find the bonds. So I think that’s another reason why that 10 year point tends to be the maximum for most people’s ladders. Barry Ritholtz: We never know what yields will be in the future. How can an investor lock in the best yields on the duration curve today and benefit over the next decade with their ladders? Karen Verra: Well, we do have an inverted yield curve right now. So we’ve seen a lot of people overweighting their ladders in that one to two year bucket trying to maximize income. Maybe they do might do an extra, you know, 40, 50 percent than what they would usually do. But I think one of the nice things you can do now is. Try to lock in the yields for the interim. We’ve been telling people on the corporate side, you can get about 5 percent by continuing to go out, 6 to 7 percent for high yield. And so we’re seeing people who are doing that right now, knowing that when the fed starts to cut rates, interest rates are going to come down and they want to put some of that cash to work and consistently be getting four, five, six percent, rather than have it dissipate, um, in those short term vehicles as soon as interest rates go down. Barry Ritholtz: I continue to see people who are waiting for inflation to re-accelerate. They’re warning that the Fed is, is looking at this incorrectly and that we should be expecting much higher yields. If that were to happen, didn’t someone who just set up a bond ladder lock in low rates or how does the ladder work in the face of that? Karen Verra: So when I think about the ladder, it’s going to be a more known investment result than some other more perpetual bond strategies. So you kind of know what your yield is going to be over that period. You can do a few things. You could use TIPs. So we have for example, tips, term maturity, ETFs, tips I bonds where you, you can get protected for the inflation. But you also have the periodic income payments kicking off the ladder that you can reinvest at higher yields, which will add income over time. And you also have that discrete point when something matures this year, you can go and grab more income. So what we see is as yields go up, you’re slowly walking that ladder up and, and recouping more of the income over time. Barry Ritholtz: What about the opposite group of prognosticators, the ones who have been forecasting a recession every year for the past three years that just hasn’t shown up? If there’s a recession and rates fall pretty radically, what happens then? What’s our reinvestment risk there? Karen Verra: So if you’ve got your ladder locked in at today’s yields and yields come down, that ladder income stream is worth more. So we’ll actually see the prices on the bonds go up in that situation. But then you’re right. When the money comes to, you’re going to be reinvesting at lower rates. And then over time that will, will get go down a bit. If you are worried about a recession, I would say, go up in quality, stick to treasuries, investment grade, the higher quality, even munis, the higher quality asset classes that you don’t have to worry about as much default risk and volatility if we do have a coming recession. Barry Ritholtz: I know you’re the strategist for iShares, which issues a lot of ETFs. When I first started in the 1990s, bond ladders were all individually owned papers and separately managed accounts. Everything was hand-selected. The minimums were pretty high. The cost structure was pretty high. The state of the art stayed that way for decades. It seems to have gotten a whole lot better, cheaper, faster, easier today. Tell us, what is the state of the art building a bond ladder using ETFs? Karen Verra: I think this is one of the innovations that has really come about in the last decade. No longer do you have to have a million dollars to create a bespoke bond ladder with an SMA manager. You can do it today for very little amounts of money. And so what we’ve seen is our I bonds have been popular inside smaller account sizes. If you’ve got, you know, a one-off account over here, or even if you have a lot of money, it’s just a very efficient way to do that. So our I bonds ETFs are term maturity ETFs. They have a maturity date, typically each December and they’re holding bonds that mature throughout the calendar year. And then when the last bond matures, The ETF will delist from the exchange and you’ll have cash hitting your account, just like a bond maturity. And we’ve got them now in treasuries, tips, munis investment grade and high yield. So five different sectors of the bond market. And then we’ve seen people really customize things for their income needs for their tax status. And they’re, they’re getting exposed to hundreds of bonds in a single ETF, as opposed to what we see with a lot of SMAs – is they might be limited to maybe 20 to 30 bonds at the most. So you’re getting diversification at a very low cost. And because they are exchange traded, if you change your mind and want to sell them, you can at any point where a lot of times with a bond, it’s really easy to buy it, but then maybe when you go to sell it, it’s hard to find a buyer or there’s large transaction costs associated with that. Barry Ritholtz: So I’m hearing diversification, lower costs, liquidity, you mentioned they all, the ETF will mature at the end of the year, so you have a defined maturity, obviously no callable bonds go into that. But it seems working with an ETF gives you – I’m doing a little bit of a commercial here, but my firm uses a lot of ETFs, we’re very happy with them, you get a lot of flexibility and professional management – this really seems to be much better than the bad old days when someone was handpicking dozens of individual bonds. Karen Verra: We still see people who are preferring that, let’s say you have special, you’re in a high-tech state and you want a special SMA dedicated to that. So we see people even using our iBonds alongside SMAs or alongside other strategies. Or maybe they’re whittling those down. Like we don’t tell people go out and sell your bond portfolio. You’re curated over decades. However, this is a great strategy, I think, to provide some liquidity, diversification, and low cost access to these different parts of the bond market. Barry Ritholtz: One of the advantages of working with various large firms like yourself, iShares, Fidelity, Schwab, whoever. You have a variety of online tools to build your own bond ladder. Tell us a little bit about what people can find if they want to just do it themselves. Karen Verra: If you go to iShares.com backslash iBonds, you’ll find our landing page and there’s a link to our iBonds ladder tool. And we designed this to be just like a report that you would get if you went to a bond manager and asked for a bond ladder, you can input your dollar amount, you can check the box on which sectors of the bond market you want to be invested in, and there’s even a slider where you can look at your maturities. And right away, it will give you an equal-weighted ladder. You can then customize that ladder. If you’d like, you can delete things you don’t want, and it will have some summary characteristics, the number of bonds, the duration, the yield, the cost, and I think it’s a, it’s a great way to just visualize those yields. Like we have people who will come in and they want to know what different Maturities of the bond market are yielding. They can go in and look in, see where the treasury curve is, the investment grade curve, the high yield curve. And I think it’s just a great source of information to even go in and see what the different parts of the market are yielding. Barry Ritholtz: So to sum up, investors that are looking for yield but are concerned about interest rates going up, down, and all over the place can solve for that problem by creating a ladder of bond ETFs, spreading it out over five to 10 years. So their interest rate risk is reduced. They’re locking in rates now and if rates go higher as things mature, they can reinvest it. And if rates go down, hey, well, at least you locked in a higher rate for the first half of that, um, of those investments. It seems to make a lot of sense and especially if you’re working towards a specific liability or a specific goal, uh, where you have an obligation down the road, this allows you with very little risk to hit those targets. Karen Verra: That’s right. We, we’re seeing. all kinds of investors using them for, for different goals and objectives, different, different terms. And I think it really empowers people to do it themselves and invest in the bond market. Barry Ritholtz: Thank you, Karen. This has been really interesting. I’m Barry Ritholtz.

Title: Is The Future Of BCI Right Under Our Nose?

Neurotech startup Augmental has raised a $4m seed round to commercialize their wearable interface for people living with motor impairment and limited hand function. The “MouthPad” offers an unprecedented and convenient alternative to a brain-computer interface, or BCI, that circumvents the need for brain surgery by enabling users to control a mouse cursor using their tongue, breaths, head gestures, and soon, voice. Augmental's MouthPad, a new kind of interface that enables hands-free control of digital devices. It’s the brainchild of two engineers, Tomás Vega and Corten Singer, who met as undergraduates at Berkeley and reunited in Cambridge to found the company at the tail end of Vega’s graduate work at MIT in 2019. Over the pandemic, they formed Augmental and relocated to San Francisco, where they recently upgraded their garage-based R&D hub for a new office space that includes a clean room for commercial-grade manufacturing and distribution. The novel form factor belies Augmental’s importance to the future of neurotech markets. Their progress over the coming years represents a crystal ball for the success or failure of companies like Neuralink, Synchron, and many others in the crowded field of implantable BCI. To understand why, let’s look at product functionality, the state of the market, and the growing, global commercial ecosystem in BCI. Augmental operates under a banner known as “Assistive Technologies.” AT includes tools to help with typing, speech, smart home functionality, as well as wheelchairs, semi autonomous robots, prosthetic or robotic limbs and some stimulation devices. Estimates vary but analysts have pegged this at a $20 billion annual market opportunity that is growing quickly as our technophile society ages. New Mobility recently published a close-up on several AT tools, and included both the MouthPad and its early impact on end user Keely Horch, a 19 year old living with quadriplegia. From the article: “The MouthPad embeds a tiny touchpad in a dental-safe resin retainer, Bluetooth-enabled, for the tongue to manipulate like a finger would. At first it was a challenge grasping the relationship between tongue, touchpad and screen, but now Horch forgets the device is even in her mouth and uses it for five hours a day, controlling her cell phone and more easily editing the papers she dictates with voice recognition, which works alongside the MouthPad without a hitch. Settings are customizable, and she right-clicks by drawing air through her lips: It’s sip-and-puff without the straw.” Each MouthPad is custom-printed based on dental scans from a national network of over 90 partnered centers across the US. Augmental’s operation is becoming scalable now, after three years of working closely with nearly 100 people living with various disabilities such as spinal cord injury and neuromuscular disorders to design and develop a product that works intuitively. Investors backing the vision include SCI Ventures, Murata, Revere Partners, LivEdge Capital, Fen, Carao and Tesserakt, as well as individuals from Andreseen Horowitz’s Scout Fund and a group of Angel Investors that include notable consumer electronics experts such as Eric Migicovsky and Nirav Patel, as well as Neuralink’s Head of Next Gen, Joey O’Doherty. Horch, an engineering sophomore in college, uses the MouthPad to play games with her brothers and participate in class, stating, “I was able to unmute myself and raise my hand and type questions up…I was able to use different software, like graphing, and it was really helpful for visualizing things.” Analysts are confident that BCI will be a $400 billion market in 20 years, but they can’t measure how much digital autonomy is worth today for people who can’t move their hands. Augmental’s users who can move their head and neck can use head-tracking for cursor control, and perform clicks and other gestures with tongue movements. Those with more limited mobility can use tongue gestures alone for cursor control, clicks, swipes, etc. How does the Mouthpad compare to implanted BCI? With a pricepoint in the low four figures (currently $1,500 through the company’s early-access program) it is a magnitude of order more affordable than the estimated range of $30,000 to $60,000 for implanted BCI. Moreover, by circumventing surgery of any sort, users avoid possible complications, from infections to difficulties upgrading the device. Critically, the functionality is comparable. Vega shared that their “Bits Per Second” test, which is one technical measure of controlling a mouse cursor with BCI, clocks in at 7.85 BPS for their top-performing quadriplegic user. Compare this to 9.51, which was Neuralink user Noland Arbaugh’s top score at the time of this writing. Most importantly, the device is available for use today. 2024 represents a breakout year for Augmental. In addition to their seed round and new office, they have crossed $100k in direct sales, published user testimonials and brought on world-class engineers and experts to expand the range of actions available to MouthPad users, including building a voice-based UI for whisper speech, and eventually fully silent speech. Moving forward, the question is not whether the MouthPad is capable of helping people. It’s how Augmental can scale growth until qualifying their device for insurance reimbursement, which would expand access to hundreds or thousands of people seeking greater digital autonomy. The complexity of delivering affordable innovations into “the disability market” cannot be understated. As Augmental navigates the broken roads experienced by people living with serious motor impairment, they’ve entered the cottage industry of AT. Finding Reimbursement for novel devices involves a whack-a-mole quest through departments of rehabilitation, vocational programs, state Medicaid offices, county level disability support offices, and the like. Despite the challenges, the number of Mouthpad users has grown to 50, with as many devices in production. MouthPad users live across 28 states, and the waitlist for the device has surpassed 3,000 people. In the background, the company is pursuing a submission to the FDA for virtual control of electronic wheelchairs, which would qualify them for CMS reimbursement down the road. Meanwhile they are helping candidates access grant funding to pay for MouthPads and have forged alliances with nonprofits to promote and sponsor device purchase. Augmental is planning an in-house team to develop and cultivate relationships with these key institutions to broaden onramps to access by meeting patients in existing communities nationwide. One such nonprofit is BCI Pioneer Ian Burkhart’s foundation, which has sponsored a handful of MouthPads for users in Ohio. In April, Burkhart, who was implanted with a research version of Blackrock’s interface in a clinical trial that ran from 2014 to 2021, shared his experience of navigating health coverage and income caps for disability programs with The Atlantic: “The salary (an end-user would) have to make to cover both expenses and in-home care out of pocket, though, is much more than most jobs pay. A lot of people don’t have the opportunity to make such a giant leap. The system is set up to force you to live in poverty.” An affordable, risk-free BCI could change the conversation around value and productivity. What if enabling success in the classroom or the workplace is comparable to the cost of a new phone, rather than a new car? For now, philanthropy represents a stop-gap to drive access. It makes sense then, that SCI Ventures, born from the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation and operating as a strategic venture philanthropy, led Augmental’s seed round. In a conversation with me this summer, SCI Venture’s Managing Partner Adrien Cohen described Augmental’s approach as “extremely elegant,” adding “I’ve seen the impact it’s had on users' autonomy and independence. In a few minutes, you’re controlling your laptop, using your phone without assistance, without a caretaker. It’s a mindblowing innovation that needs to exist in the world.” The challenging opportunities facing Vega, Singer, and their team of ten engineers and designers could reveal several promising paths for Augmental in the coming months: What’s in it for the BCI companies? It comes down to competitive strategy. In a recent article, Burkhart, Jen French, and colleagues discuss the opportunities and gaps in building Assistive Technology. These include co-development of products and standards designed with end-users in mind. Beyond calling for tech companies to do the right thing by engaging people with lived experiences (including those who might not be eligible for implantation), they call for closer consideration of how inclusive design could attract cause-driven funders and improve adoption of frontier technologies, while facilitating scale-up through crowdsourcing. There are many BCI companies emerging, but few functional wearable control interfaces out there, ready to use and scale today. So, where can commercial leaders and investors find a revenue-generating, low-risk market opportunity to help people living with disability today, while generating unique insights on user preferences, habits, requirements, limitations, and ideas that could differentiate BCI roadmaps and strategy?

Title: Bitcoin Going to $200K by 2025 Is a ‘Conservative’ Estimate, Says Global Asset Manager Bernstein

Analysts at Bernstein, a leading research and brokerage firm that is a subsidiary of global investment firm AllianceBernstein (AB), have reportedly described their Bitcoin price prediction of $200,000 by the end of 2025 as “conservative.” They urged those skeptical about cryptocurrency to reconsider its potential, particularly given the rising U.S. debt levels. According to a report by James Hunt for The Block, Gautam Chhugani, who leads Bernstein’s digital assets division, sent a note to clients on Wednesday stating, “Bitcoin is on track to reach $200,000 by the end of this cycle, projected for 2025. We consider this a conservative estimate.” The forecast follows the recent release of Bernstein’s “Bitcoin Blackbook,” which is aimed at guiding institutional investors interested in the cryptocurrency. Legendary Research Broker Bernstein Has Just Published One of its Famed "Black Books" on #Bitcoin!160 Pages Explaining Why BTC Will Hit $200k by the end of 2025 and How Listed #Bitcoin Miners Will Continue to Consolidate the Industry. @gautamchhugani 👏 pic.twitter.com/lDnAvWeYIe Chhugani pointed out that, in a world where the U.S. national debt now stands at $35 trillion and inflationary risks persist, Bitcoin’s scarcity as a digital asset offers strong appeal as a “store of value.” He added that those who view gold as a solid investment should find Bitcoin an even more compelling option. For investors looking for indirect exposure to Bitcoin, Chhugani suggested considering companies like MicroStrategy, which holds the largest amount of Bitcoin on its corporate balance sheet, and Robinhood, which is growing its crypto offerings. Chhugani also pointed to the potential of U.S.-based firms such as Riot Platforms and CleanSpark, which are amassing significant energy capacity for Bitcoin mining. He noted that Core Scientific is leveraging its resources for both AI hosting services and Bitcoin mining, tapping into the growing demand for AI infrastructure. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $66,349, down 0.7% in the past 24-hour period. The BTC price is down 9.5% from its all-time high of around 10% from an all-time high of roughly $73,737 set on 14 March 2024, but up 58.31% in the year-to-date period. On October 16, Real Vision’s Chief Crypto Analyst Jamie Coutts presented a bullish outlook for Bitcoin, citing the increasing backing from institutional investors. Coutts highlighted a notable change in asset allocation preferences, driven by BlackRock CEO Larry Fink’s public support for Bitcoin. He pointed out that BlackRock’s Aladdin platform, widely used by sovereign wealth funds and major asset managers for portfolio modeling, now integrates Bitcoin seamlessly via its ETF. This, Coutts argued, has cleared the way for Bitcoin’s price to rise significantly. He predicted that even a small reallocation of institutional investments from traditional assets like sovereign bonds to Bitcoin could see BTC surpass $500,000 by the end of the decade. With #crypto bro Fink endorsing #Bitcoin's portfolio-enhancing qualities, a seismic shift in asset allocation preferences is underway. @BlackRock's Aladdin platform, utilized by the largest sovereigns and money managers, provides the tools for modelling and attribution while… https://t.co/gxaxwBRdTP pic.twitter.com/FeNKnggUuf Featured Image via Pixabay The views and opinions expressed by the author, or any people mentioned in this article, are for informational purposes only, and they do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice.

Title: Caelan Doris confirmed as captain as Ireland’s squad for Autumn Series is named
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/rugby/2024/10/23/caelan-doris-confirmed-as-captain-as-irelands-squad-for-autumn-series-is-named/
Time Published: 2024-10-23T13:22:44Z
Full Content:
And so it has come to pass. If historians ever come to revisit Andy Farrell’s squad announcement for the 2024 Autumn Nations Series its most notable aspect will probably be the passing of the baton as captain to Caelan Doris. He was only conferred as Leinster captain last month but he already looked like a prospective Lions king. Allowing for the Peter O’Mahony interregnum for last season’s Six Nations, and a deserving promotion it was too for someone who captained Munster for a decade, Ireland rugby teams have tended to have a go-to leader for the duration of World Cup cycles. Brian O’Driscoll was the captain for the 2007 and 2011 cycles, to be followed by Paul O’Connell (2012-15), Rory Best (2016-19) and Johnny Sexton (2020-23). Now we are entering the Doris era, and at 26 who is to say for how long. But certainly up until the 2027 World Cup in the USA and potentially beyond looks probable. One always had the impression that Farrell identified Doris as captain for this cycle quicker than the player himself did, and that being the modest type he is, Doris didn’t particularly aspire to the role. Farrell’s thinking was evident from the second round of last season’s Six Nations, when he named Doris captain ahead of James Ryan in the absence of O’Mahony. His thinking is entirely understandable, for whether or not Doris becomes a great orator in time, he leads by deed and, if fit and well, is a world-class player and is one of the first names on the team sheet. Perhaps the first. Doris also has an aura or presence about him, and just because his anointment was inevitable doesn’t make it any less of a landmark. Especially so in a largely predictable reprise of the 35-man squad initially named for last summer’s two-Test tour to South Africa save for five changes, all injury related. Where Dan Sheehan was one of the three hookers then, only to be replaced by Dave Heffernan, after his ACL injury in the first Test, now the Connacht man is named alongside Rónan Kelleher and Rob Herring. Despite both being sidelined, the expectation clearly is that Herring, and at a push Kelleher, will be fit for the opening game against the All Blacks. With Oli Jager injured, the other five props are retained, while the fit-again Iain Henderson is added to the other locks. Having been ruled out of the South African tour, Jamison Gibson-Park returns at the expense of Nathan Doak. The other two changes see the return of the Mack, in the guise the fit-again Hansen, and Hugo Keenan, after his secondment to the Ireland Olympic Sevens squad. The injured Jordan Larmour and Jimmy O’Brien miss out, as does the unlucky Jack Conan. Hence Cian Prendergast and the uncapped Cormac Izuchukwu are retained, as is the former’s brother Sam, who is the only other uncapped player. Farrell has an eye for prospective Test match players, witness the unhesitating promotion of Gibson-Park to the matchday 23 even when he was ostensibly number two at Leinster, and likewise Joe McCarthy, Hansen and Jamie Osborne, not least as a fullback. Although Farrell’s thinking at outhalf appears to have influenced Leinster this season, he doesn’t tell the provinces what to do, he shows them. Perhaps in part because of the increasing logjam at Leinster given Frawley’s conversion to 10 and the emergence of Sam Prendergast in addition to Ross and Harry Byrne, it almost seemed as if this season’s Emerging Ireland tour was devised more for the younger Prendergast sibling than any other player. He started all three games, was given his head in organising the team’s attacking play and received effusive praise from the stand-in head coach Simon Easterby, who will deputise for Farrell again in the Six Nations when Ireland seek a historic three titles in a row. Given Izuchukwu was also on both the senior tour and Emerging Ireland tour to South Africa, it seems reasonable to deduce that Farrell and Easterby also admire the athletic Ulster backrower, whose emergence may have happened sooner but for injuries. It therefore also seems reasonable to speculate that both Izuchukwu and Prendergast are being earmarked for Test debuts in this window, with the third game against Fiji looking like an ideal opportunity to do so. The absence of the unlucky Jack Conan again, after he suffered a hamstring injury in Leinster’s win over Munster and the likely absence of O’Mahony, until halfway through the window, reduces Farrell’s options in the backrow. For the opening game against the All Blacks, the likelier ploy is move Tadhg Beirne to blindside in accommodating Ryan and McCarthy in the secondrow, as in the second Test win over the Springboks, or picking two from those three at lock and start Ryan Baird in the backrow. Ciarán Frawley is putting pressure on Jack Crowley, but despite his mixed start to the season with Munster he is likely to be retained alongside the returning Gibson-Park. Bundee Aki’s extra sharpness and fitness could see him start against the All Blacks alongside Garry Ringrose, while the back three looks more competitive with the return of Hansen, Keenan, and not to mention the sight of Jacob Stockdale back to his attacking best. While he has earned some game time in this window, his problem is that James Lowe has become such an integral part of the team with his hefty left boot, physicality, offloading and finishing. Then there’s Osborne, outstanding at fullback in both Tests in South Africa and excellent for Leinster at inside centre this season, form and versatility which will be hard to resist in the matchday squad against the All Blacks. As well as an eye for prospective internationals, Farrell places great store by loyalty, with O’Mahony named despite being restricted to just 23 minutes of Munster’s URC round three fixture. There are also places for the other two current centurions, scrumhalf Conor Murray and Cian Healy as one of five props. Healy can, of course, also cover hooker in an emergency, an invaluable commodity in the modern era. Currently on 131 caps, Healy is thus in line to equal and perhaps surpass O’Driscoll’s all-time Irish record of 133 caps. Forwards (19): Ryan Baird (Leinster), Finlay Bealham (Connacht), Tadhg Beirne (Munster), Caelan Doris (Leinster, capt), Tadhg Furlong (Leinster), Cian Healy (Leinster), Dave Heffernan (Connacht), Iain Henderson (Ulster), Rob Herring (Ulster), Cormac Izuchukwu (Ulster), Rónan Kelleher (Leinster), Joe McCarthy (Leinster), Peter O’Mahony (Munster), Tom O’Toole (Ulster), Andrew Porter (Leinster), Cian Prendergast (Connacht), James Ryan (Leinster), Nick Timoney (Ulster), Josh van der Flier (Leinster).

October 23, 2024 By Neenah Payne Downfall of The Legacy Media shows that the legacy media is rapidly declining because it lost the trust of many Americans. It failed to report accurately on so many issues including the Biden laptop, January 6, the open southern border, COVID, and the injuries and deaths caused by the COVID shots. That failure woke up a lot of folks who now rely on the Alt Media for reliable information. COVID-19 also woke up a lot of people including the following: 1 – Dr. Robert Malone was the inventor of the mRNA and DNA vaccine core platform technology used in the Pfizer and Moderna COVID shots. Dr. Malone recommended against the use of the mRNA technology because it could not be used safely. So, when the mRNA Covid shots were released, he assumed the safety issue had been resolved. He got the shot which caused him many severe problems.However, Dr. Malone is now the President of the Global COVID Summit of 17,000 doctors and has gone around the world since 2020 frequently speaking in opposition to the COVID shots and globalization. He is the author of the 2022 book Lies My Gov’t Told Me: And the Better Future Coming. Dr. Malone is the Medical Director of The Unity Project, a group of 300 organizations across the US standing against mandated COVID vaccines for children.MRNA Inventor Says To Stop COVID “Vaccines” Now shows that when Dr. Malone was interviewed on 6/24/22 by Del Bigtree, host of The Highwire in mRNA PIONEER RAISES COVID VACCINE CONCERNS, Dr. Malone called for an immediate halt to the COVID shots. mRNA VACCINE INVENTOR CALLS FOR STOP OF COVID VAX says, “Dr. Robert Malone, inventor of the mRNA vaccine, sits down with Del to give his honest concerns about why this is the wrong technology to use against #Covid19 and, in particular, the extreme danger it poses to young people.” The Physicians Declaration Calls COVID Policies “Crimes Against Humanity” shows that Dr. Malone read the petition against the COVID shots signed by more than 5,200 doctors. On a trip to Europe, Dr. Malone met Dr. Mattias Desmet, a psychologist, a statistician, and a professor of clinical psychology at Ghent University in Belgium who is the author of the 2022 book The Psychology of Totalitarianism. In Mattias Desmet about Mass Formation and modern society, Tucker Carlson explained that during his interview on the Joe Rogan show #1757 on 12/30/21, Dr. Malone introduced Prof. Desmet’s theory of “Mass Formation” (psychosis) to explain mass compliance with the absurd COVID policies. Desmet says loneliness is the root cause of group think because compliance gives people a sense of belonging. Why Joe Rogan’s Interviews on Mass Psychosis “Broke The Internet” explains that on The Highwire show EPISODE 249: BREAKING MASS PSYCHOSIS on 1/7/22, Bigtree explained that Dr. Peter McCullough on December 18 and Dr. Malone on January 3 discussed the concept of “mass psychosis” on the Joe Rogan show. That sent an overwhelming number of viewers to the internet searching for more information to understand how COVID has been used to drive Americans crazy with fear. Del explained that in WHAT IS MASS FORMATION PSYCHOSIS? IS THE PUBLIC BEING GASLIT? . Kim Iversen showed on January 5 that the term “mass formation psychosis” trended on so many searches over the weekend that it “broke the internet”! When Google censored the information, she went to DuckDuckGo and found that the term came from Joe Rogan’s December 31 interview with Dr. Malone. COVID Mass Psychosis: Causes and Solutions discusses the situation further. Joe Rogan Video Banned from YouTube explains that YouTube censored the episode and it is no longer available! Why Doesn’t Google Want You to Know About ‘Mass Formation Psychosis’? Dr. Malone met former Blackrock Portfolio Manager Edward Dowd in Maui and introduced him to the world. Dowd is the author of Cause Unknown: The Epidemic of Sudden Deaths in 2021 and 2022 and 2023 and has since been widely interviewed. Ed Dowd: COVID Shots Are Causing Youth Democide explains that Dowd discussed shocking excess mortality. “The millennial age group 25 to 44 experienced an 84% increase in excess mortality into the fall. It’s the worst ever excess mortality, I think, in history”. 2 – Dr. Brett Weinstein initially wore masks during COVID. However, Game-Changing Tucker Carlson Interview! shows that when he spoke with Carlson in February 2024, he had become part of the “Dream Team” fighting “Goliath”! In Joe Rogan Experience #2198 Bret Weinstein on 9/4/24, Dr. Weinstein discussed Rescue The Republic – Join The Resistance which he had helped organize to save the West. It was held on The Mall in Washington, DC on September 29. 3 – Dr. Naomi Wolf: Shocking New Book: The Pfizer Papers discusses the 2024 book The Pfizer Papers: Pfizer’s Crimes Against Humanity by New York Times best-selling author Dr. Naomi Wolf. In The Crime of “Talking to Tucker Carlson”, Dr. Wolf explains how COVID woke her up and how that alienated her from much of her family and friends on the Left. 4 – World-renowned British cardiologist Dr. Aseem Malholtra recommended the COVID shot for his father and took it himself. However, when his very healthy father suddenly died at age 73, Dr. Malholtra came to the conclusion that it was because of the COVID shot. Documentary: First Do No Pharm! links to the new film by Dr. Malholtra. The documentary examines the vast amount of fraud in medical research designed to benefit big pharma at the expense of humanity. The following former Democrats have awakened and have left the Democratic Party. 1 – Mikki Willis is the filmmaker who released Plandemic 1 in 2020 which has been seen by over 1 billion people worldwide although social medial blocked it. Willis followed that with Plandemic 2: InDoctor Nation and Plandemic 3: The Great Awakening. See the Plandemic series. Willis is the author of the 2021 book Plandemic: Fear Is the Virus. Truth Is the Cure. Wills was an avid supporter of Democratic Party candidate Bernie Sanders until he realized Sanders is not a socialist, but a communist. 2 – Del Bigtree, was an Emmy award-winning member of The Doctors TV show for five years who produced 30 episodes He quit to produce the film Vaxxed: From Cover-Up to Catastrophe which went viral in 2016. Bigtree is now the host of The Highwire which airs online Thursdays from 2-4 ET with an audience of 30 million in six nations. Bigtree says his parents were hippies who still support the Democratic Party. However, he says he now feels politically marooned because the Democratic Party of today no longer supports the values it held when he was growing up.Now is the MOST Important Moment In Human History w/ Del Bigtree 3 – Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced his candidacy for the US presidency in 2023, running as a “Kennedy Democrat” to align with the values of the Democratic party of his uncle President John Kennedy in 1963 and father Robert F. Kennedy who served as Attorney General and ran for the presidency in 1968. In 2024, RFK Jr. joined Trump’s Make America Great Again (MAGA) campaign with a pledge to Make America Healthy Again (MAHA). Trump Adopts RFK Jr.’s War on Junk Food to Win Over His Fans. See Kennedy’s Plan To Restore America’s Health. 4 – Tulsi Gabbard: Are Democrats Waging War on America Now? explains that Tulsi Gabbard represented Hawaii in Congress from 2019-2021 and ran for the presidency in 2019 as a Democrat. Tulsi’s 2024 book: For Love of Country: Leave the Democrat Party Behind explains why she left the party in 2022 to become an independent.

However, there is a home for us in the Republican Party. The Republican Party of warmongering elite Dick Cheney is in the past. Trump’s GOP is a big open tent party of the people, equality, commonsense, and the party that is led by a President who has the courage and strength to fight for peace. Tonight I stood with President Trump and announced I am joining the Republican Party. President Trump is our best and only hope in this election to lead our country toward a future where every one of us can live in a truly free, peaceful, and prosperous nation. Now is the time for us to stand together, vote for Trump and save our country. Neenah Payne writes for Activist Post Top image: Katie Horton/YouTube Become a Patron!

Title: Could AI Help Employers Make Strides In Workplace Gender Equality?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbestechcouncil/2024/10/23/could-ai-help-employers-make-strides-in-workplace-gender-equality/
Time Published: 2024-10-23T10:30:00Z
Full Content:
Punnam Raju Manthena, Co-Founder & CEO at Tekskills Inc. Partnering with clients across the globe in their digital transformation journeys. The gender gap in the workplace remains a key business and economic issue. Back in 2015, a McKinsey report found that reducing the gender gap could add about $12 trillion to $28 trillion to the global GDP by 2025. In 2024, the chief economist for the World Bank stated that closing the gender gap "could raise global gross domestic product by more than 20%." For years, business leaders have been called on to deal with gender equality as an economic need and fundamental right, but progress is still stalled. According to findings from BlackRock, companies "with the most diverse workforces outperformed their country and industry group peers with the least-diverse workforces in terms of return on assets." Businesses with about 30% women in senior positions are 15% more profitable, as per the Victorian Government. This same report found that Australia's GDP would go up by 11% if the gender gap closed. All these point to a serious need for gender equality. So, not only is gender equality beneficial to business and society but equally importantly, gender inequality is detrimental to both. But, as an employer, how do you move toward gender equality? Can AI, the supposed game changer in the IT industry, help gender equality? The advent of AI could potentially open employment doors for women in a big way. AI, or AI-driven automation, is creating several jobs or roles that we did not think of earlier. Aside from technical skills, AI-related roles call for focused nature, communication, collaboration, adaptability, ability to learn, critical thinking, problem-solving, functional knowledge, etc. AI is data-driven and, hence, has the potential to be unbiased—but only if properly trained. Leveraging AI, employers could help develop more inclusive practices in hiring, appraising, awarding hikes, promoting and dealing with career breaks. This could help negate gender-induced interferences and discrimination. Employers could use AI to help rewrite pay-related policies or identify employees who may otherwise get passed over for promotions or those who may leave. Using AI, employers could gather data from multiple sources, viz. incidents, surveys, etc., to identify harassment possibilities, and provide for anonymous reporting, enabling more employees to report without fearing retaliation. This could help businesses build a safe online working environment with a focus on reducing workplace harassment. In doing so, organizations can create a supportive environment and prioritize mitigating the risks associated with workplace misconduct. That said, human intervention is crucial due to the risks associated with AI. However, gender bias in AI is still a very real issue and risk. Women make up only about 33% of the tech employees and only 8% of the managerial roles as per PWC, so have the representation needed to address these biases. A study by the Berkeley Haas Center for Equity, Gender, and Leadership analyzed 133 AI systems in multiple domains and saw that about 44% of them showed gender prejudice. There could be inherent and unintentional gender biases in systems, and since AI works with the available data, these already-existent prejudices may come into play. These prejudices, social barriers, notions, etc., are all hard to break and are difficult to get beyond. Therefore, AI ethics is paramount in this discussion. The tech industry needs to get more women in AI to counter this issue consciously. According to UN Women, "The AI field needs more women, and that requires enabling and increasing girls’ and women’s access to and leadership in STEM and ICT education and careers." To overcome these barriers, tech leaders need to eliminate these biases. We need to ensure women engineers, developers and coders are involved in the creation and training of AI systems. We need to ensure we're genuinely creating a level playing field in hiring, learning, upskilling, appraising and advancing opportunities. To turn things around and achieve greater gender equality at work, we need to prioritize inclusivity when developing these systems, and having many perspectives involved in developing and training AI models can help negate gender-oriented biases. Business leaders need to carefully monitor and advise when implementing AI in HR functions. Human oversight is key to the ethical use of the technology. Employers should ensure their HR teams develop clear and transparent goals, a mature data strategy, proper deployment (of proven tools, technologies and sources), awareness creation, and regular evaluation and course correction where necessary, etc. These guidelines should then be shared with employees at all levels to ensure the company is on the same page.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Jim Cramer Stocks To Buy According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) stands against the other Jim Cramer stocks. Jim Cramer recently highlighted a promising start to earnings season, pondering whether the two-year-old bull market can continue its upward trajectory during an episode of Mad Money. To address this, Cramer emphasized the importance of keeping emotions in check, cautioning against complacency. He turned to analysis by Jessica Inskip, a prominent figure in the investment community who currently serves as the Director of Investor Research at StockBrokers.com. Inskip, who co-hosts the Market MakeHer podcast, has made important forecasts, including identifying the bottom in big tech growth stocks earlier this year. “... She nailed the bottom in big tech growth stocks this spring, and she's been generally bullish, constructive on the major averages all year. And those are terrific calls. Well, as Inskip sees it, things are looking pretty darn good. But even as the rally's broadening out, moving away from just the Magnificent Seven to a whole host of smaller stocks, she says, we still need tech to participate if we're going to get another leg higher. Tech doesn't have to lead the way anymore, but it has to at least follow the leaders.” Cramer then shifted the conversation to the broader market, querying the potential of stocks outside the tech giants. He pointed out the value of the S&P 500 Equal Weight index, where all 500 components carry equal importance, contrasting it with the traditional market capitalization-weighted index, which heavily favors a few large companies. Cramer noted that 2024 has been particularly favorable for the 493 other stocks within the S&P 500, as the Equal Weight index has shown impressive performance. “First, you can see this thing's been doing great because 2024 has been all about the other 493 stocks in the index. Second, Inksip sees a lot to like here. The trading cycle for the S&P 500 Equal Weight is bullish. “ Cramer mentioned that Inskip is keenly watching for higher highs in this sector. While some technicians may view a rising RSI as a warning sign, Inskip reassures that it is not a concern as long as prices continue to climb. Currently, the S&P Equal Weight index remains well above its key quarterly moving averages, according to Inskip. Cramer reiterated the importance of this Equal Weight perspective, emphasizing that the performance is not overly reliant on the Magnificent Seven, as the broader index is being supported by the remaining stocks. Turning to the Nasdaq 100, which features the hundred largest non-financial stocks on the Nasdaq, Cramer acknowledged that while Inskip sees it in a bullish trading cycle, it hasn’t yet reached new highs like the S&P. Nevertheless, the quarterly moving averages are still trending upward, providing support. Inskip pointed out that the Nasdaq made a higher high back in July, but for it to gain real momentum, it must surpass that peak. Once that level is breached, she believes it could trigger a broader market rally. Coming toward the conclusion, Cramer said: “Bottom line, the charts interpreted by Jessica Inskip are looking pretty darn good for the S&P and the Nasdaq 100… We've got a much broader bull market than we had six months ago. But if it's going to keep running, Inskip says we need to see some meaningful participation from tech.” Our Methodology For this article, we compiled a list of stocks that Cramer was bullish on during episodes of Mad Money aired in October. We narrowed the list to 10 stocks that were most favored by analysts. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their average analyst price target upside as of October 18. The average price target upside was calculated while the market was open. We also mentioned the hedge fund sentiment around each stock, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s Q2 database of more than 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A close up of a complex looking PCB board with several intergrated semiconductor parts. Average Price Target Upside: 20.70% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 108 Cramer has commended Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AMD) CEO and expressed interest in the company’s analyst day and its result. Here's what he had to say: “Not to be outdone, Lisa Su, the CEO of AMD, will hold an analyst day and it’s entitled Advancing AI 2024. It starts at noon. Today, when the stock was plummeting, I told investing club members at my 10:20 morning meeting that Su’s presentation could show this charitable trust holding in a whole new light, even as they’ve been raising their AI sales forecast quarter after quarter after quarter. I think it’s a buy ahead of the meeting, although the stock did run eight points after we talked about it at the morning meeting.” Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is a prominent semiconductor company known for its diverse product offerings, which include x86 microprocessors, graphics processing units (GPUs), chipsets, and various solutions tailored for data centers. The company recently hosted an event titled "Advancing AI" on October 10, where CEO Lisa Su provided insights into the upcoming generation of chips, which showed that the company is making significant progress in its technology development. During the event, Su highlighted the new MI325X chip, which is designed to deliver 80% more high-bandwidth memory compared to the H200 and improve inference performance by 30%. Although the MI325X is not expected to ship until the first quarter of 2025, it represents an important step in Advanced Micro Devices' (NASDAQ:AMD) ongoing innovation efforts. Su also announced plans to introduce another new GPU, the MI350X, next year. This chip, based on the next-generation CDNA (compute DNA) 4 architecture, is expected to achieve a remarkable 35-fold increase in performance over its predecessor, the MI300X. The MI350X is positioned to compete directly with Nvidia's Blackwell chips, with shipments scheduled to begin in the second half of 2025. Overall AMD ranks 6th on our list of Jim Cramer stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of AMD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Bitcoin Is Suddenly Braced For A Huge Elon Musk And Tesla Earthquake Ahead Of Critical Price ‘Tipping Point’

Bitcoin has swung wildly this last week after Tesla chief executive Elon Musk issued a surprise crypto endorsement. Unlock over $3,000 in perks including unparalleled access to a community of top Web3 entrepreneurs, creators, and investors, providing you with premium networking, priority access to global events, Free access to Forbes.com and our Forbes CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor newsletter. Apply now! The bitcoin price, up over 200% since its recent 2022 lows, has soared this year thanks to Wall Street giant BlackRock leading a bitcoin and crypto "revolution." Now, as Elon Musk warns the U.S. is hurtling toward the brink of "bankruptcy," traders are braced for his electric car company Tesla to post its third quarter earnings, potentially revealing why it suddenly moved its near-$800 million worth of bitcoin last week. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run Elon Musk's Tesla sent shock waves through the bitcoin and crypto market when it suddenly moved its ... [+] bitcoin last week, fueling fears Musk could either crash or boost the bitcoin price. "We believe that the Tesla wallet movements that we reported on last week were wallet rotations with the bitcoin still owned by Tesla," blockchain sleuths with Arkham Arkham Intelligence posted to X, adding: "Tesla moved their entire balance of 11,509 bitcoin ($776.9 million) to new wallets." Tesla suddenly moving its bitcoin last week, the first time it's moved for around two years, sparked speculation that it was being moved for an over-the-counter sale. In early 2022, Musk sold off the majority of the $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin he had added to Tesla's balance sheet a year earlier to secure a quarterly profit for the company. Tesla will post its 2024 third-quarter results after the U.S. market closes on Wednesday, October 23, and may reveal why it moved its bitcoin. Tesla is the fourth largest corporate holder of bitcoin after bitcoin mining companies Riot and Marathon and Michael Saylor's software company MicroStrategy—which holds $17 billion worth of bitcoin. This week, Musk surprised the bitcoin and crypto market with an endorsement after recently directing his attention toward criticism of the U.S. spending, repeatedly warning the U.S. is hurtling toward the brink of "bankruptcy." "I think cryptocurrency is an interesting and probably valuable bulwark against centralized control," Musk said, speaking at a campaign rally for former U.S. president Donald Trump in Pittsburgh when asked by an attendee whether the cryptocurrency XRP XRP could be incorporated into the financial system. "Crypto by its very nature helps with individual freedom," Musk said, adding he wasn't endorsing XRP or any other specific cryptocurrency. Musk later said he "wasn't actively involved in crypto," dodging a question about whether blockchains, the technology that underpins bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, could be used in future elections to reduce or eliminate voter fraud. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has surged back toward its all-time highs this year, with Tesla and Elon Musk ... [+] poised to trigger a major bitcoin price move. Meanwhile, bitcoin and crypto traders are closely watching the polls ahead of next month's U.S. presidential election, which could be a bitcoin price "tipping point." "Take a bird’s eye view of bitcoin, and the world’s most valuable cryptocurrency has been stuck in a holding pattern since March. The question on everyone’s lips is, ‘what will it take to move it?'" Richard Ptardio, cryptocurrency and financial markets analyst, said in emailed comments. "Bitcoin bulls are looking at next month’s U.S. election as the tipping point. Should Donald Trump be returned to the White House, the promise of a low-regulation administration and the likely removal of Gary Gensler as U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chair could break the resistance required for new all-time highs," Ptardio said. Trump has enthusiastically embraced bitcoin and crypto this year, backing his family's World Liberty Financial crypto project and selling four non-fungible token (NFT APENFT ) collections. Speaking earlier this year at a bitcoin conference, Trump promised to create a U.S. bitcoin strategic reserve if reelected and predicted the bitcoin price could eventually eclipse gold. "However, even with Trump in office, bears may be right to sound a note of caution," Ptardio said. "There are signs that bitcoin is no longer the safe haven from the type of geo-political uncertainty that tends to follow him." One Community. Many Voices.

Average Price Target Upside: 15.87% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 92 During a previous episode of Mad Money in October, Cramer said that he is a buyer of The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) stock. “It’s come down quite a bit. It sells at 18 times earnings. It’s down today because of I think the storms, but you know what? Disney is doing much better than people realize. And it’s about time, people started giving a little more respect. I’m a buyer of it. The analysts are dumping all over it. They’re dumping all over it now. I say buy more Disney.” Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) is one of the biggest names in the global entertainment industry, engaging in various sectors such as film and television production, streaming services, and theme park operations. On October 15, UBS maintained its Buy rating on the stock with a price target of $120. UBS expects results for the fourth quarter to show challenges in the Parks division while highlighting profitability in direct-to-consumer segments, improved box office performance, and consistent trends in linear television. The firm projects a year-over-year revenue increase of 7.2%, estimating an EBIT rise to $3.7 billion from $3 billion in the previous year, which could lead to a 33% growth in earnings per share for the quarter. For fiscal year 2024, the firm expects EPS growth exceeding 30%, aligning with management's guidance of $4.92. Furthermore, mid-single-digit EPS growth is expected for fiscal year 2025, with the potential benefits from the deconsolidation of India assets and cost efficiencies from Hulu expected to create additional opportunities as the year unfolds. Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) is set to introduce a new attraction entry pass called the Lightning Lane Premier Pass. It allows guests willing to pay between $129 and $449 to enjoy exclusive access to some of the park's most popular attractions. A limited number of these passes will be available starting October 23 at Disneyland in California, followed by a launch at Disney World a week later.

Title: Tokenization Unstoppable: Mega Whale Holds 3 Tons of Gold Onchain

Gold, the original store of value, is inching closer to $3,000 and is currently trading above $2,700, printing fresh all-time highs in the process. As the yellow metal stretches gains, capital may flow to Bitcoin, the digital alternative, forcing the world’s most valuable coin above $74,000. While gold and Bitcoin have advantages, with the more suave favoring the fluidity of BTC, one holder seems to be interested in both. A recent analysis by Arkham, a blockchain intelligence firm, reveals that one wallet holds over $250 million in Tether Gold. In the real world, this tokenized stash weighs approximately 3 tons. For now, the owner of this tokenized stash remains unknown. However, using AI, Arkham speculates that the 3 tons of gold belong to RhinoFi. According to on-chain data, the layer-2 bridge has processed over $2.3 billion worth of assets from more than 48.8 million transactions. It currently bridges 31 chains, connecting over 2 million accounts. Tether Gold is technically a stablecoin tracking the real-world value of gold. As of October 22, over 246,520 tokens of digital gold had been minted on Ethereum. According to Ethplorer, there are 2,618 token holders making more than 39,500 transfers. Although it cannot be immediately determined that RhinoFi controls nearly 50% of all Tether Gold in circulation, tokenization is picking up traction. The success of USD-backed stablecoins like USDT and USDC and their widespread adoption, especially in emerging economies, explain why they are here to stay. Converting real-world assets into tokens on public ledgers like Ethereum or Polygon makes it easier for users to transfer and gain exposure. The CEO of BlackRock predicts the tokenization market will command trillions in the next few years. Coingecko data shows over $7.9 billion of assets have been tokenized. Most of them are on Ondo, Pendle, and Mantra. Beyond Tether Gold, other tokenized alternatives include Pax Gold and Quorium. In addition to gold, real estate and United States Treasuries have been tokenized. BlackRock, one of the world’s largest asset managers, currently issues BUIDL on Ethereum. Looking at rwa.xyz data, over $2.4 billion worth of United States treasuries, bonds, and other cash equivalents have been tokenized. BlackRock’s BUIDL currently manages over $550 million of tokenized treasuries. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: Ambani’s Jio in Talks With Allianz for Insurance JVs in India

Jio Financial Services Ltd., controlled by billionaire Mukesh Ambani, has held talks with Allianz SE to set up an insurance partnership in India as the German firm seeks to scrap two existing joint ventures in the country, according to people familiar with the matter. Allianz and Jio Financial are looking to establish a general insurance and a life insurance company in the South Asian nation, the people said, asking not to be identified as the information isn’t public. The discussions are in early stages and both parties may decide not to proceed with the plan, the people said. The Munich-based firm has indicated to its current partner Bajaj Finserv Ltd. that it’s “actively considering an exit” from the ventures, according to a statement from Bajaj on Tuesday after Bloomberg News reported the planned split. Allianz “has indicated that it remains committed to the Indian insurance market,” according to the statement. The break-up centers around a dispute over the direction of the partnership, people familiar with the matter had said. A spokesperson for Jio Financial said the firm is unable to comment on speculation. “If and when there are any material developments with respect to the company, we will continue to make necessary disclosures in accordance with our obligations, as we always have,” the spokesperson added. Allianz doesn’t comment on market rumors, a Munich-based spokesperson said. Jio Financial, helmed by veteran banker K.V. Kamath, already runs a shadow bank and an insurance brokerage and has joined forces with BlackRock Inc. to start an asset management business. Setting up insurance operations will help further the Ambani unit’s ambition of becoming a financial services behemoth. India’s insurance penetration rate — the ratio of premiums to gross domestic product — is less than half that of countries such as South Africa and Canada, implying strong growth prospects for the sector, insurance regulator data show.

Title: Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Unveils New Copilot AI Features to Boost Productivity; Faces Downgrade Amid Concerns Over AI Chip Reliance

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 15 AI News Investors Should Not Miss. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other AI stocks investors should not miss. Artificial Intelligence developments are making headlines across various sectors. From high-profile legal battles to groundbreaking advancements in model performance and safety protocols, AI is reshaping the landscape across industries at an unprecedented pace. READ ALSO: 15 AI News Investors Should Not Miss and 20 Trending AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings Before we move on to the breaking news on AI, let’s talk about Morningstar’s recent report. The investment research firm reveals that for the third consecutive year, investors are leaving exchange-traded funds related to specific themes for funds linked to broad stock-market benchmarks "that are hitting record highs". Despite overall growth in equity ETFs, thematic ETFs have lost $5.8 billion in investor capital in the year 2024. This is greater than $4.8 billion outflows in all of 2023. The reason? Broad market index returns are setting a higher bar for thematic funds this year. "It's not that people don't like the idea of themes any longer, but that a bull market dominated by a handful of megacaps makes it hard for any theme to stand out”. As per Morningstar, thematic ETFs often struggle due to mistimed investments, with investors usually missing out on two-thirds of their returns. Despite some AI-themed funds having strong holdings, higher fees and timing challenges reduce their overall appeal. "I think that when S&P 500 megacaps stop delivering the way they do today, the focus will shift back to thematic ETFs”. Moreover, while AI remains a key focus in many thematic ETFs, its impact goes far beyond investing. Consider Penguin Random House, the first of the Big Five anglophone trade publishers to amend its copyright information. The publisher has recently added a language to its copyright pages to prohibit the use of those books to train AI. Publishers and AI firms will be increasingly clashing in the future if clear guidelines and processes aren’t kept in place. In a similar endeavor, The New York Times has sent Perplexity AI, an AI-powered research firm, a "cease and desist" notice demanding that it stop using the newspaper's content for generative AI purposes. The news publisher claims that the way the AI Company uses its material violates copyright law. In other news, Anthropic, a U.S.-based artificial intelligence public-benefit startup, is now adding a comprehensive update to its safety policy, reinforcing the guardrails of its AI as it becomes more capable. This push to improve AI safety is in stark contrast to competitors such as OpenAI, whose increasing focus on improving capabilities and performance is very likely to threaten safety guidelines in the future. As per McKinsey, 63% of companies consider inaccuracy risk to be relevant. However, only 38% of companies are working to mitigate the risk. While artificial intelligence may be intimidating, it is equally, if not more, beneficial for mankind. In its latest achievement, AI has helped UCLA researchers develop a deep-learning framework that teaches itself to automatically analyze and diagnose MRIs and other 3D medical images. That too, with the accuracy matching that of medical specialists in a fraction of the time. Another breakthrough from Archetype AI, a physical AI company, is set to significantly change how we understand and interact with the physical world. The model, named Newton, shows the unparalleled capacity to generalize across diverse physical phenomena using only raw sensor measurements as input. Finally, in our roundup of the latest AI news, the US rules that will ban certain US investments in artificial intelligence in China are under final review, as per a government posting. The rules, requiring US investors to notify the Treasury Department regarding some investments in AI and other stem technologies, come from an executive order signed by President Joe Biden in August 2023. The order aims to keep American investors' know-how from aiding China's military. Chipmakers and related companies that may be impacted by the decisions denied responding to Reuters' requests for comment. Methodology For this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A development team working together to create the next version of Windows. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 279 Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is an American multinational corporation and technology company that develops and markets software, services, and hardware. The company’s AI strategy is evident through its partnership with OpenAI and the integration of AI across Azure, Office 365, and security solutions which together create a strong ecosystem. On Monday, October 21, Microsoft had its “AI Tour” in London, announcing the rollout of its Copilot AI features designed to enhance productivity by automating routine administrative tasks. The company plans to allow businesses to create their own autonomous agents within the Copilot Studio, Microsoft’s platform for building and customizing its “Copilot” assistants, fending off challenges from Salesforce. These agents can be built in the studio with low code or no code instructions, which in turn allow users to create AI-driven workflows without needing major technical expertise. The software will be available for public preview next month. The technology company has also revealed that it will launch 10 new autonomous agents in Dynamics 365, which is the company’s suite of enterprise resource planning and customer relationship management apps. The company’s autonomous agents aim to achieve a return on investment in AI. As per CFO Amy Hood, the company has spent $19 billion on capital expenditures, including finance leases, a large portion of which was derived from AI and cloud-related needs. With 2.1 million users engaged with Copilot, Microsoft is banking heavily on the platform to generate revenues. As of Q4, the company achieved $36.8 billion in quarterly revenue from its cloud services, which includes its AI platform, a 21% year-over-year increase. While all these announcements may seem like a big leap for Microsoft, the company received a rare downgrade last month over concerns about the tech giant’s over-reliance on Nvidia for its AI infrastructure. On September 23, analysts at D.A. Davidson, an investment banking company, downgraded the company’s stock from “Buy” to “Neutral”, keeping their price target unchanged at $475. While the analysts are still positive about Microsoft, they note how the company lags behind its rivals in AI chip development, something its rivals started working on as early as a decade ago. “They started their chip development later than Amazon and Google. But apart from that, they’re doing what they need to do.” Overall MSFT ranks 1st on our list of the AI stocks investors shouldn't miss. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MSFT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 15 AI News Investors Should Not Miss. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other AI stocks investors should not miss. Artificial Intelligence developments are making headlines across various sectors. From high-profile legal battles to groundbreaking advancements in model performance and safety protocols, AI is reshaping the landscape across industries at an unprecedented pace. READ ALSO: 15 AI News Investors Should Not Miss and 20 Trending AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings Before we move on to the breaking news on AI, let’s talk about Morningstar’s recent report. The investment research firm reveals that for the third consecutive year, investors are leaving exchange-traded funds related to specific themes for funds linked to broad stock-market benchmarks "that are hitting record highs". Despite overall growth in equity ETFs, thematic ETFs have lost $5.8 billion in investor capital in the year 2024. This is greater than $4.8 billion outflows in all of 2023. The reason? Broad market index returns are setting a higher bar for thematic funds this year. "It's not that people don't like the idea of themes any longer, but that a bull market dominated by a handful of megacaps makes it hard for any theme to stand out”. As per Morningstar, thematic ETFs often struggle due to mistimed investments, with investors usually missing out on two-thirds of their returns. Despite some AI-themed funds having strong holdings, higher fees and timing challenges reduce their overall appeal. "I think that when S&P 500 megacaps stop delivering the way they do today, the focus will shift back to thematic ETFs”. Moreover, while AI remains a key focus in many thematic ETFs, its impact goes far beyond investing. Consider Penguin Random House, the first of the Big Five anglophone trade publishers to amend its copyright information. The publisher has recently added a language to its copyright pages to prohibit the use of those books to train AI. Publishers and AI firms will be increasingly clashing in the future if clear guidelines and processes aren’t kept in place. In a similar endeavor, The New York Times has sent Perplexity AI, an AI-powered research firm, a "cease and desist" notice demanding that it stop using the newspaper's content for generative AI purposes. The news publisher claims that the way the AI Company uses its material violates copyright law. In other news, Anthropic, a U.S.-based artificial intelligence public-benefit startup, is now adding a comprehensive update to its safety policy, reinforcing the guardrails of its AI as it becomes more capable. This push to improve AI safety is in stark contrast to competitors such as OpenAI, whose increasing focus on improving capabilities and performance is very likely to threaten safety guidelines in the future. As per McKinsey, 63% of companies consider inaccuracy risk to be relevant. However, only 38% of companies are working to mitigate the risk. While artificial intelligence may be intimidating, it is equally, if not more, beneficial for mankind. In its latest achievement, AI has helped UCLA researchers develop a deep-learning framework that teaches itself to automatically analyze and diagnose MRIs and other 3D medical images. That too, with the accuracy matching that of medical specialists in a fraction of the time. Another breakthrough from Archetype AI, a physical AI company, is set to significantly change how we understand and interact with the physical world. The model, named Newton, shows the unparalleled capacity to generalize across diverse physical phenomena using only raw sensor measurements as input. Finally, in our roundup of the latest AI news, the US rules that will ban certain US investments in artificial intelligence in China are under final review, as per a government posting. The rules, requiring US investors to notify the Treasury Department regarding some investments in AI and other stem technologies, come from an executive order signed by President Joe Biden in August 2023. The order aims to keep American investors' know-how from aiding China's military. Chipmakers and related companies that may be impacted by the decisions denied responding to Reuters' requests for comment. Methodology For this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 179 NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a global technology company engineering the most advanced chips, systems, and software for the AI factories of the future. The company is said to represent “the dominant” infrastructure player behind the current rise of the AI sector. Wall Street is abuzz with excitement about NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s new AI chip, Blackwell. Sector analysts are enthusiastic about the company’s potential major upside in the fourth quarter with all the initial rush of Blackwell. On October 18, Ram Ahluwalia, Lumida Wealth Management CEO, discussed on Yahoo Finance’s Catalysts how things are looking up for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) . According to Lumida CEO, the company is still in the “early innings” and expects that Nvidia’s stock will reach $150 between now and the end of the year. With the hyperscalers intending to each spend between $50 and $100 billion on GPU compute, the primary beneficiary is going to be NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), he says. Lumidia's CEO further commented how the company has a class of its own and doesn’t have a “close competitor”. There is a growing confidence that the chip giant will be the first Tech firm to reach a $4 trillion valuation. "We made a call earlier this year that Nvidia would be the most valuable company in the world. It achieved that milestone yesterday, and the demand for GPU chips is strong. And you're seeing enterprises start to get some ROI (return on investment) on it from the early adopters”. On Friday, October 18, Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya reiterated his “Buy” rating on the stock, raising his price target by $25 to $190. From Taiwan Semiconductor's (one of Nvidia’s major suppliers) third-quarter results to the “insane” demand for Blackwell chips as quoted by Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, the analyst believes that recent industry trends have the potential to increase the company’s lead and generational opportunity. Furthermore, “underappreciated” enterprise partnerships with companies are also catalysts for more growth. “We also highlight a growing presence of AI in enterprise, where NVDA is the partner of choice (more on pg. 10)”. According to the bank’s forecast, the AI technology market will grow from $45 billion in 2023 to $117 billion this year while Nvidia maintains a 75% market share, which translated to a staggering $272 billion in AI computing revenues for Nvidia by 2030. Arya also believes the company could see at least $200 billion in free cash flow generation over the next two years. Overall NVDA ranks 3rd on our list of the AI stocks investors shouldn't miss. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Close-up of a technician's hands adjusting a communication router. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 18 Lumen Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:LUMN) is a global communications services provider that offers various integrated products and services to business and residential customers. The telecom company has been benefitting from soaring AI demand and the need for greater connectivity between data centers, with it being in a strategic position to help drive the AI growth wave. On October 21, Lumen Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:LUMN) announced that it will be partnering with Meta Platforms Inc. to increase the latter’s network capacity and help drive its “bold AI missions”. The partnership will offer it enhanced flexibility with secure, on-demand bandwidth, supporting its complex computing requirements and allowing it to serve billions daily. Meta will be able to improve the size and dependability of its AI system through Lumen’s Private Connectivity Fabric providing dedicated connections. "We're enabling one of the biggest expansions of network capacity in our lifetime. We've transformed our company to meet this demand. As Meta's customers use more AI services across its platforms, we're helping provide Meta with a seamless, effortless, and flexible network that will meet its growing needs." Following the partnership news, Raymond James analyst Frank Louthan stated that the partnership is unlikely to move Lumen’s stock. He maintains a “Market Perform” rating on Lumen. He also emphasized that this action appears to be part of the previously announced $5 billion conduit network transaction from August. "We do not believe this announcement warrants any near-term moves in the shares as it is likely already reflected in the outlook”. Overall LUMN ranks 12th on our list of the AI stocks investors shouldn't miss. While we acknowledge the potential of LUMN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than LUMN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We recently compiled a list of the 15 AI News Investors Should Not Miss. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Richtech Robotics Inc. (NASDAQ:RR) stands against the other AI stocks investors should not miss. Artificial Intelligence developments are making headlines across various sectors. From high-profile legal battles to groundbreaking advancements in model performance and safety protocols, AI is reshaping the landscape across industries at an unprecedented pace. READ ALSO: 15 AI News Investors Should Not Miss and 20 Trending AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings Before we move on to the breaking news on AI, let’s talk about Morningstar’s recent report. The investment research firm reveals that for the third consecutive year, investors are leaving exchange-traded funds related to specific themes for funds linked to broad stock-market benchmarks "that are hitting record highs". Despite overall growth in equity ETFs, thematic ETFs have lost $5.8 billion in investor capital in the year 2024. This is greater than $4.8 billion outflows in all of 2023. The reason? Broad market index returns are setting a higher bar for thematic funds this year. "It's not that people don't like the idea of themes any longer, but that a bull market dominated by a handful of megacaps makes it hard for any theme to stand out”. As per Morningstar, thematic ETFs often struggle due to mistimed investments, with investors usually missing out on two-thirds of their returns. Despite some AI-themed funds having strong holdings, higher fees and timing challenges reduce their overall appeal. "I think that when S&P 500 megacaps stop delivering the way they do today, the focus will shift back to thematic ETFs”. Moreover, while AI remains a key focus in many thematic ETFs, its impact goes far beyond investing. Consider Penguin Random House, the first of the Big Five anglophone trade publishers to amend its copyright information.

On October 17, Richtech Robotics Inc. (NASDAQ:RR) revealed that it plans to use its robotics and artificial intelligence cloud technology to run 20 more Walmart-located restaurants in Arizona, Colorado, and Texas. In a binding letter of intent signed with Ghost Kitchens America, the companies will enter into a franchise agreement whereby Richtech Robotics Inc. (NASDAQ:RR) will acquire exclusive rights to operate the restaurants. The restaurants will be directly managed by Richtech Robotics’ subsidiary, AlphaMax Management LLC.

A Nuclear power plant with all its safety & security protocols in place. Oklo Inc. (NYSE:OKLO) is a nuclear technology company engaged in the design and development of fission power plants to provide reliable and commercial-scale energy to customers in the United States. AI has been driving significant energy demand, and nuclear energy has emerged as a strong avenue to address the increase in power demand. Last week, Amazon Web Services announced plans that it will invest $500 million in nuclear power. Big tech companies are increasingly facing energy demands driven by the AI revolution, and many of them have already entered into agreements to meet their energy needs. Following the announcement, nuclear names such as Oklo Inc. (NYSE:OKLO) continued to rise on Monday on the back of optimism in the sector. There is also increased speculation that Sam Altman’s backed Oklo Inc. (NYSE:OKLO) will be the next one to secure a deal with a major tech player. In a CNBC interview last week, Oklo CEO Jacob DeWitte stated the massive demand for power is being driven by AI growth. When asked about the potential for the company to announce a deal similar to Google’s deal with Kairos Power, he stated that there is “a lot more to come”. Oklo shares closed on Monday with a 22.4% increase, reaching $22.32. Overall OKLO ranks 14th on our list of the AI stocks investors shouldn't miss. While we acknowledge the potential of OKLO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Title: Mukesh Ambani warming up to Allianz for insurance amid Bajaj exit plans? Here's what we know
URL: https://www.businesstoday.in/latest/corporate/story/mukesh-ambani-warming-up-to-allianz-for-insurance-amid-bajaj-exit-plans-heres-what-we-know-451155-2024-10-23
Time Published: 2024-10-23T05:54:52Z
Full Content:
Feedback Jio Financial Services Ltd., led by Mukesh Ambani, is reportedly in talks with German insurance giant Allianz SE to explore a potential insurance partnership in India. Discussions are focused on establishing both general and life insurance companies in India, claimed a Bloomberg report. These talks are in early stages, and it is still unclear if the companies will proceed with the plan. Allianz is reportedly looking to exit its two existing joint ventures with Bajaj Finserv Ltd., marking the end of a partnership that has lasted more than two decades. Bajaj Finserv confirmed that Allianz is “actively considering an exit” from its life and general insurance ventures, citing a shift in Allianz's strategic priorities. This was confirmed following a report by Bloomberg. The break-up between Allianz and Bajaj Finserv stems from a dispute over the direction of the partnership, with sources indicating that Bajaj’s refusal to allow Allianz to raise its stake at a discounted price contributed to the rift. Additionally, Allianz reportedly was not given a say in key strategic decisions. A spokesperson for Jio Financial Services declined to comment on the ongoing speculation, stating, "If and when there are any material developments, we will continue to make necessary disclosures." A spokesperson for Allianz, based in Munich, also stated that the company does not comment on market rumors, Bloomberg stated in the report. Jio Financial, which is currently led by veteran banker K.V. Kamath, has already ventured into financial services through a shadow banking operation and insurance brokerage. The firm has also teamed up with BlackRock Inc. to enter the asset management business. The addition of insurance to its portfolio would further Jio Financial’s ambitions of becoming a major player in India’s financial sector. India’s insurance penetration rate is significantly lower than that of countries such as South Africa and Canada, highlighting the sector’s potential for growth. According to data from the insurance regulator, this presents a considerable opportunity for companies like Jio Financial and Allianz. Business Today could not independently verify the details of the ongoing talks. The story will be updated following comments from Jio Financial and Allianz. Copyright©2024 Living Media India Limited.
