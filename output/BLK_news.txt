ByAlan Ohnsman ByAlan Ohnsman, Forbes Staff. When Elon Musk appeared in the White House last week at a ceremony with President Donald Trump marking the end of his controversial role leading the federal job-slashing DOGE initiative, he sported a shiner on his right eye that he claimed came from toddler son X. That literal black eye will heal, but the figurative ones Tesla and Musk’s reputation have received from his political activities are likely to linger. Some of Tesla’s biggest shareholders — including unions like the American Federation of Teachers, whose 1.8 million members participate in pension funds with $4 trillion of assets under management, including $8.8 billion of Tesla shares — see one group as largely to blame: the EV company’s board. “People don't like Elon Musk,” AFT President Randi Weingarten told Forbes. “We've taken the position over the course of the last few months of: ‘Do your job board. Do your job financial industry. Do the job you're supposed to do, which is the governance of Tesla.’” “Make sure he’s there or get another CEO” Weingarten and the teacher’s union have been pushing fiduciary officers overseeing major state and city pension funds, as well as investment firms like BlackRock, Fidelity, Vanguard, T. Rowe Price and TIAA, to review their Tesla holdings and pressure the board to change its ways. “We don't want Tesla to fail because if Tesla fails that means a lot of retirees are going to lose a lot of money in terms of their portfolios,” Weingarten said. She added: “If you're going to have Musk there, then make sure he's there. Don't have him do these extracurricular activities. Make sure he’s there or get another CEO.” Nine state treasurers and comptrollers sent a letter to Tesla Chair Robyn Denholm in April raising concerns about risks to their economies if the company falters because of poor board governance. “No other publicly traded company CEO would've been allowed to neglect his day-to-day duties like Musk has. No exception,” said Illinois Treasurer Michael Frerichs, who signed the letter. “And if they had undertaken personal activities that hurt the reputation of a company or brand that badly, would they be treated like he has been?” CalPERS, the largest U.S. pension fund representing public workers in California, had no specific comment on Tesla and said its investments are “are index-oriented and optimized using systematic and quantitative investment strategies, not driven by any single period’s events.” However, it sold 4.5 million Tesla shares in the third quarter of 2024. The fund held about 9.4 million Tesla shares as of its last annual filing, a stake worth $3.2 billion as of June 3. Tesla fell 2.9% to $332.05 on Wednesday. The shares are down about 18% this year. Musk for years has divided his time as Tesla chief with leadership roles at SpaceX, X, The Boring Co., Neuralink and xAI, but his Trump administration job proved particularly harmful to the brand, spurring protests at Tesla stores and vandalism of its vehicles and facilities. A poll conducted by Washington-based GBAO last month found that Musk was viewed unfavorably by 55% of the 2,000 Americans it surveyed, while Tesla ranked as the least favored brand among poll participants who have or are considering getting an electric vehicle. Most importantly, 51% of survey respondents said they’d view Tesla more favorably if the world’s wealthiest human were replaced as CEO. “If you look at what’s happened to views toward Musk and the brand among people who are the target, it seems irreversible. His numbers are atrocious.” Musk has now said he’s stepped back from his DOGE duties and Tesla stock has rallied in the past few weeks, jumping more than 50% since April 21, as many investors appear hopeful he’ll be more engaged in leading the company, particularly as it prepares to launch a pilot robotaxi program in Austin this month. He’s even shown signs of breaking with Trump, labeling the the president’s so-called Big Beautiful budget bill a “disgusting abomination” on Tuesday because of how much it increases the federal deficit. GBAO GBAO Principal Margie Omero, who oversaw the Musk-Tesla survey, isn’t sure the billionaire’s latest moves will make a difference. “He may say he's stepping away but his involvement with Trump, both in helping to elect him and in helping enact Trump's wishes in government, all those things are not going to change. They’re not over,” she said. Pollster GBAO focuses mainly on progressive issues and notes that Tesla’s core customer base and EV buyers generally tend to identify as Democrats. “If you look at what’s happened to views toward Musk and the brand among people who are the target, it seems irreversible. His numbers are atrocious.” “Tesla's brand has suffered dramatically alongside Elon Musk's brand–in some ways they’re one and the same,” said Maryland Comptroller Brooke Lierman, also a signatory to the April letter to board chair Denholm. Maryland’s State Retirement Agency currently has about $175 million invested in Tesla through pooled accounts. “As somebody who keeps an eye on the returns of our retirement portfolio and our investments, I am always looking to make sure that our retirees and their hard-earned retirement dollars are invested wisely–and with companies governed by boards we can trust and who are engaged in responsible business practices,” Lierman said. GBAO Musk’s behavior and unrestrained comments on social issues have persisted for years, from his false claim in 2018 that he’d lined up funding to take Tesla private. The same year he called a critic “pedo guy” and had to go to court to defend his comments in a defamation trial because of it. During a 2020 earnings call meltdown, he decried emergency public health rules at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic as “fascist.” More recently, he gave what looked like a Nazi-style salute at a Trump victory rally, and in February wildly waved a chainsaw around onstage at a conservative political conference. Recent and detailed reports of his use of drugs including ketamine and Adderall haven’t helped. Denholm didn’t respond to a request for comment. Weingarten, Frerichs and Lierman said they’ve had no response from Tesla’s board from their letters. Weingarten said AFT is weighing potential legal action against Tesla’s board, though hasn’t made a final decision on the matter. Musk “has done huge damage to the Tesla brand and Tesla’s reputation,” she said. “If boards are not going to do their job, outside pension funds, including advocates of them, are going to try to force these boards to do their jobs.”

UAE Foreign Minister Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan discusses the significance of President Donald Trump’s visit, trade deals and more on ‘Special Report.’ President Donald Trump’s recent visit to the UAE marked a pivotal moment for UAE-U.S. bilateral relations, shining a spotlight on a shared vision for the future. As the UAE and the "New Gulf" pivot from oil to cutting-edge technologies, our partnership with the U.S., rooted in decades of trust, has become a beacon of what’s possible when nations collaborate. This trust has paved the way for a bold new chapter: a strategic economic alliance poised to create tens of thousands of high-tech, energy and manufacturing jobs, driving prosperity in both of our countries. At the heart of this collaboration lies the new U.S.-UAE AI Acceleration Partnership. This initiative will advance cooperation in artificial intelligence and other transformative technologies while spurring investment flows between our nations. TRUMP REVERSES COURSE ON MIDDLE EAST TECH POLICY, BUT WILL IT BE ENOUGH TO COUNTER CHINA? A cornerstone of this effort is the establishment of a 10-square mile state-of-the-art AI campus in Abu Dhabi, the largest outside the U.S.. With five gigawatts of AI data center capacity, it will act as a vital hub for U.S. hyperscalers or large cloud service providers and large enterprises, serving partners and friends across the region and in the global south. President Donald Trump and UAE President Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan talk on Thursday, May 15. (AP/Alex Brandon) To support this vision, the UAE and U.S. governments have agreed on a pathway for the UAE to acquire advanced American AI semiconductors. A handful of U.S. voices have begun to raise concerns about the security of this technology. The fact is that we understand these concerns and fully agree that access to sensitive technologies comes with great responsibility. SILICON, STEEL AND MEGAWATTS: CAN AMERICA CREATE THE INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDED TO WIN THE AI RACE? Importantly, this new partnership sets a global benchmark for securing advanced U.S. technology. Through the implementation of a "Regulated Technology Environment," approved UAE organizations acquiring regulated US technologies will adhere to extensive physical and cybersecurity protocols. These involve regular audits, third-party validations and active oversight by both nations’ governments. The direct involvement of leading U.S. companies further ensures that advanced AI chips and technologies are fully protected from diversion or unauthorized access. This is nothing new. These measures underscore our commitment to a long-term, trusted technology partnership with the U.S. that builds on decades of collaboration. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION The UAE previously established the Executive Office for Control and Non-Proliferation with the mission to enhance export controls and prevent the unauthorized transfer of dual-use military/civilian items and technologies. For over 25 years, the UAE has deployed cutting-edge American defense technologies, from F-16 fighter jets to THAAD missile systems. And the strict safeguards in a landmark 2009 agreement have enabled the UAE access to U.S. civilian nuclear energy know-how and cooperation. WHITE HOUSE THANKS UAE FOR AGREEING TO 10-YEAR, $1.4 TRILLION INVESTMENT FRAMEWORK Further confirming this mutual trust, UAE-backed GlobalFoundries manufactures America’s most classified microchips for defense and advanced computing in upstate New York and Vermont. As a key part of the new partnership, UAE companies will expand these technology investments into new U.S. data centers, digital infrastructure and energy projects, critical to powering the AI revolution. These measures underscore our commitment to a long-term, trusted technology partnership with the U.S. that builds on decades of collaboration. This partnership is a two-way street. U.S. companies are also doubling down on their presence in the UAE. Microsoft is partnering with G42, Google is launching a Cyber Security Excellence Center in Abu Dhabi, and Raytheon is opening a new UAE production facility. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Major U.S. financial institutions, including BlackRock and JPMorgan, have set up shop in Abu Dhabi, while Wynn Resorts and Disney are developing landmark projects in the Emirates. From Abu Dhabi to Atlanta, Dubai to Detroit, and Ras Al Khaimah to Reno, investment is flowing, technology is advancing and businesses are thriving. The recent meeting between President Trump and UAE President His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan wasn’t just a celebration of past achievements, it was a launchpad for what’s next. This partnership isn’t just about quick wins; it’s about building a shared future of innovation, opportunity, and prosperity. Together, the UAE and the U.S. are crafting a legacy that will not only benefit our two nations but also inspire progress around the world for decades to come. Yousef Al Otaiba is the Ambassador of the United Arab Emirates to the United States and Minister of State. His time in Washington, D.C. has been marked by several bilateral accomplishments in the fields of security, civil nuclear energy, health, education, culture and more.

Title: Best crypto to buy as Truth Social files for a Spot Bitcoin ETF
URL: https://coinjournal.net/news/best-crypto-to-buy-as-truth-social-files-for-bitcoin-etf/
Time Published: 2025-06-04T08:43:50Z
Full Content:
In a surprising move that sent ripples through the crypto market, Donald Trump’s social media platform, Truth Social, has officially filed to launch a Spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF). The filing, submitted through the parent company Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG), marks a notable pivot into digital assets, suggesting growing institutional interest in Bitcoin. The development has sparked renewed enthusiasm among retail investors and crypto enthusiasts alike, with meme coins like Bitcoin Pepe also riding the wave of attention and experiencing a surge in investor interest. According to documents filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), TMTG aims to capitalize on Bitcoin’s growing legitimacy and investor demand by offering a Spot Bitcoin ETF. Unlike futures-based ETFs, which track Bitcoin contracts, a spot ETF would directly hold Bitcoin, allowing investors exposure to real BTC prices without needing to manage a digital wallet. The move places Truth Social in the company of major asset managers like BlackRock and Fidelity, who launched similar products earlier this year. However, TMTG’s entrance into the ETF space is particularly notable given its political backing and its predominantly conservative user base, potentially opening up Bitcoin exposure to a new demographic of retail investors. The filing is already leading to increased speculation in altcoins, especially high-potential meme coins such as Bitcoin Pepe, as traders look for ways to ride the momentum. While the ETF filing directly concerns Bitcoin, its ripple effect is being felt across the broader crypto market – especially in the meme coin segment. Historically, meme coins thrive during periods of heightened mainstream attention and speculation. The association of Donald Trump’s brand with a financial product tied to crypto reintroduces an entertainment and political angle that energizes retail participation. As capital flows into Bitcoin via ETFs, retail investors often seek cheaper, higher-upside alternatives – and meme coins like Bitcoin Pepe are prime candidates. The political spectacle, media buzz, and renewed focus on crypto could create the perfect storm for meme coin rallies in the coming months. In the sea of meme coins that have flooded the crypto market this year, Bitcoin Pepe is a standout since it has raised more than $13 million during the presale, indicating strong interest in its utter commitment to instant transactions and ultra-low fees. Plus, Bitcoin Pepe is now only 13 days away from a CEX listing that typically leads to a new wave of demand, which often results in significant price increase. With Bitcoin’s visibility rising due to Truth Social’s ETF ambitions, meme coins tied to Bitcoin’s branding – like Bitcoin Pepe – are also gaining traction. As a hybrid of two cultural forces in crypto (Bitcoin and the iconic Pepe meme), Bitcoin Pepe offers strong viral potential, particularly among Gen Z and meme-savvy traders.

Title: Texas Removes BlackRock From Energy Boycott Blacklist

More Info Texas has removed BlackRock from its list of oil and gas investment boycotters after the asset manager shrank its ESG footprint, ending a three-year quiet confrontation that saw Texas state investment vehicles pull billions out of BlackRock. “I am pleased to announce a significant decline in the number of investment funds that boycott the oil and gas industry, as well as the removal of BlackRock Inc. from the Comptroller's office list of companies that boycott energy companies,” Texas State Comptroller Glenn Hegar said in a statement. “Directly related to our listing process, BlackRock has stepped back from full participation in the Climate Action 100+ and completely exited the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative. It has dramatically reduced the number of fund offerings that prohibit investment in oil and gas, and it shifted away from blanket policies that ignore the critical need for fossil fuel-based energy generation now and long into the future,” Hager also said. The saga began back in 2022, when Texas passed legislation forbidding state agencies from investing in any of a number of companies that, the state’s government said, boycotted the oil and gas industry. The black list of such companies included many Wall Street heavyweights eager to get a piece of the energy transition business. BlacRock was among the most prominent entities featured on the list. The asset manager protested its inclusion in the list, saying it has investments in the oil and gas industry and no plans to quit these. The firm noted $120 billion in investments in Texas public energy companies, out of a total of $320 billion in energy investments globally. Nevertheless, the Texas Permanent School Fund withdrew some $8.5 billion in investments from the fund manager last year. BlackRock, by the way, is not the only one quitting various net-zero alliances, at least in part as a result of the pressure campaign of conservative U.S. state governments against the anti-oil and gas shift, but also in response to constantly tightening reporting and emission-tracking requirements originating within these alliances.

Title: Bitcoin Moves With Gold And M2 Money Supply – Next Rally Loading?
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-moves-with-gold-and-m2-money-supply-next-rally-loading/
Time Published: 2025-06-04T08:00:15Z

Bitcoin (BTC) is increasingly mirroring gold’s historic price performance and the trajectory of the global M2 money supply, prompting crypto analysts to forecast a potential major rally for the world’s leading cryptocurrency. In an X post shared earlier today, crypto analyst Jelle shared the following chart that reveals a recurring pattern – gold tends to lead Bitcoin, which subsequently “catches up” in price action. This relationship underscores the growing perception of BTC as digital gold. Historically, Bitcoin’s price movements have aligned with those of gold, driven by similar macroeconomic dynamics such as inflation, expansive monetary policy, and investor demand for scarce assets. As gold continues to rally amid rising global liquidity and geopolitical tensions, Bitcoin appears to be following suit. Bitcoin’s reputation as a store of value is also gaining traction among institutions. Robert Mitchnick, Head of Digital Assets at BlackRock, recently described BTC as a “superior alternative” to gold – a strong endorsement from the world’s largest asset manager. Meanwhile, another analyst, CryptoGoos, drew attention to BTC’s tendency to follow shifts in the global M2 money supply. He noted that Bitcoin often lags behind increases in M2 by roughly two months, suggesting that the cryptocurrency may soon witness another rally. For the uninitiated, the global M2 money supply refers to the total amount of money circulating in the economy, including cash, checking deposits, and other similar monetary instruments. An increase in M2 often signals monetary expansion, which can lead to inflation and push investors toward assets like gold and Bitcoin as hedges. From a technical perspective, BTC is also showing bullish signs. In an X post today, seasoned analyst Titan of Crypto pointed out that Bitcoin has formed a golden cross on the four-hour chart. This occurs when a short-term moving average (MA), typically the 50-day MA, crosses above a long-term average, such as the 200-day MA. The golden cross is widely regarded as a bullish indicator and may signal further upside. Various metrics suggest that the BTC rally is far from over yet. For instance, Titan of Crypto recently stated that BTC is following the Golden Ratio Multiplier, targeting $130,000. Similarly, crypto enthusiast KillaXBT predicted a BTC price of $120,000 by mid-June. However, there are some risks to monitor to avoid getting caught up in a price crash. Analysts caution that if Bitcoin falls below the critical support range of $97,000 – $99,000, it could trigger a sharper correction. At press time, BTC trades at $106,610, up 2.2% in the past 24 hours. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: Wanted: Independent directors for PSU boards. But where is the approval?

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. Mumbai: Over three-fourths of India’s listed public sector enterprises do not have the requisite number of independent directors, as these companies continue to wait for clearance from various government departments. As many as 62 out of 79 listed PSUs lack the mandated number of independent directors, according to data from Prime Database. Despite repeated regulatory reminders, these companies await clearances from their respective ministries, delaying crucial appointments and inviting penalties from stock exchanges. Government-owned firms, including Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd, Indian Oil Corp. Ltd, Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corp, State Bank of India, National Aluminium Company Ltd. and Steel Authority of India Ltd, did not have the minimum number of independent directors as of 2 June, according to Prime Database, a Mumbai-based market data tracking firm. The list of non-compliant PSUs includes banks, oil and gas companies, metals and mining firms, power utilities, telecommunications, railways, and engineering firms. According to the Securities and Exchange Board of India’s listing regulations, at least one-third of a listed entity's board members must comprise independent directors. Additionally, if the chairman is an executive director, at least half of the board must consist of independent directors. Also Read: HPCL gets new chief, four more large PSUs in queue Boardroom bottlenecksThere are more red flags when it comes to board committees: 64 PSUs lack an independent director as chairperson of their audit committee, and 68 companies do not have independent chairs for their nomination and remuneration panels. Additionally, 14 of the listed PSUs are yet to appoint a single woman director, despite gender diversity requirements, according to Prime Database. “It’s ironic that we are asking all private sector companies to comply with these requirements when government-owned companies themselves are non-compliant," said Pranav Haldea, managing director at Prime Database. With PSUs failing to comply with the market regulator’s rules, many have been fined by stock exchanges. Last week, National Aluminium Company Ltd (Nalco) was fined ₹33.32 lakh for having only three independent directors—two short of the required five—on its 10-member board. A spokesperson for Nalco said the company was continuously following up with the ministry of mines, its administrative ministry, for the appointment of the requisite number of independent directors. The bottleneck lies in the approval process across various ministries, according to proxy advisory firms. “The Prime Minister’s Office should send a strong message to all concerned ministries and PSU companies that they need to be compliant, as non-compliance by PSUs doesn't send the right message to investors," said Shriram Subramanian, founder and managing director of InGovern Research Services, a proxy advisory firm. “For instance, when the government, as a major shareholder, is involved in abusive transactions or there is trouble with key management, independent directors are the custodians of minority shareholders’ interests," Subramanian said. Also Read: India's PSU banks outshine private peers in arresting bad loans Many of the largest money managers, including BlackRock and Vanguard, have voiced their concerns when these companies have sought shareholder approval for the appointment of directors, according to voting disclosures reviewed by Mint. In August last year, Hindustan Aeronautics sought shareholder approval for the appointment of former chairman C.B. Ananthakrishnan. Nearly a fourth of public institutions opposed the decision. “Nominee serves as chair of the board and bears responsibility for lack of independence. Nominee is an executive director on the audit committee," noted BlackRock, the world’s largest money manager, with $11.6 trillion in assets under management. In the same month, Hindustan Petroleum Corp. sought shareholders’ approval for the appointment of Pankaj Kumar as a director, but 28.35% of public institutions, including Vanguard, opposed his re-appointment. "There has been an expectation that the exchanges or Sebi will act, more so given the repeat violations, but neither has been able to address this issue," said Amit Tandon, founder and managing director of Institutional Investor Advisory Services (IIAS), a Mumbai-based proxy advisory firm. "The solution may be to move these entities out of the control of the administrative ministry and into a direct fund that will focus on governance and value creation," he said Despite these lapses, investor interest in PSUs has surged. The BSE PSU Index, which comprises 63 companies, has outperformed the Sensex over the last five years. The index has gained 301% between 5 June 2020 and 3 June 2025, while the Sensex has risen by 135.5% during this period. There are more red flags when it comes to board committees: 64 PSUs lack an independent director as chairperson of their audit committee, and 68 companies do not have independent chairs for their nomination and remuneration panels. Additionally, 14 of the listed PSUs are yet to appoint a single woman director, despite gender diversity requirements, according to Prime Database. “It’s ironic that we are asking all private sector companies to comply with these requirements when government-owned companies themselves are non-compliant," said Pranav Haldea, managing director at Prime Database.

Last week, National Aluminium Company Ltd (Nalco) was fined ₹33.32 lakh for having only three independent directors—two short of the required five—on its 10-member board. A spokesperson for Nalco said the company was continuously following up with the ministry of mines, its administrative ministry, for the appointment of the requisite number of independent directors. The bottleneck lies in the approval process across various ministries, according to proxy advisory firms. “The Prime Minister’s Office should send a strong message to all concerned ministries and PSU companies that they need to be compliant, as non-compliance by PSUs doesn't send the right message to investors," said Shriram Subramanian, founder and managing director of InGovern Research Services, a proxy advisory firm. “For instance, when the government, as a major shareholder, is involved in abusive transactions or there is trouble with key management, independent directors are the custodians of minority shareholders’ interests," Subramanian said. Also Read: India's PSU banks outshine private peers in arresting bad loans Many of the largest money managers, including BlackRock and Vanguard, have voiced their concerns when these companies have sought shareholder approval for the appointment of directors, according to voting disclosures reviewed by Mint. In August last year, Hindustan Aeronautics sought shareholder approval for the appointment of former chairman C.B. Ananthakrishnan. Nearly a fourth of public institutions opposed the decision. “Nominee serves as chair of the board and bears responsibility for lack of independence. Nominee is an executive director on the audit committee," noted BlackRock, the world’s largest money manager, with $11.6 trillion in assets under management. In the same month, Hindustan Petroleum Corp. sought shareholders’ approval for the appointment of Pankaj Kumar as a director, but 28.35% of public institutions, including Vanguard, opposed his re-appointment. "There has been an expectation that the exchanges or Sebi will act, more so given the repeat violations, but neither has been able to address this issue," said Amit Tandon, founder and managing director of Institutional Investor Advisory Services (IIAS), a Mumbai-based proxy advisory firm. "The solution may be to move these entities out of the control of the administrative ministry and into a direct fund that will focus on governance and value creation," he said Despite these lapses, investor interest in PSUs has surged. The BSE PSU Index, which comprises 63 companies, has outperformed the Sensex over the last five years. The index has gained 301% between 5 June 2020 and 3 June 2025, while the Sensex has risen by 135.5% during this period.

Title: Bitcoin ‘Going To Take Over’—Tesla CEO Elon Musk Backs Shock $40 Trillion U.S. Dollar Collapse Warning Amid Price Boom

ByBilly Bambrough ByBilly Bambrough, Senior Contributor. Bitcoin has surged over the last year, propelled higher by Wall Street’s embrace of crypto and U.S. president Donald Trump’s support (despite Google revealing a serious BlackRock bitcoin nightmare just got a lot worse). Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes’ CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" The bitcoin price set a new all-time high of $112,000 per bitcoin last month, surging 50% from its April low and helped by U.S. vice president JD Vance issuing a huge crypto prediction. Now, as the Covid-era meme stock craze turns to bitcoin, Tesla billionaire Elon Musk has restarted his campaign against out-of-control U.S. government spending, backing a warning that bitcoin could “take over” from the U.S. dollar as the world’s reserve currency. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run Tesla chief executive Elon Musk has reposted a wild bitcoin prediction following the huge bitcoin ... More price rally. “If the electorate doesn’t hold Congress accountable to reducing the deficit, and start paying down the debt, bitcoin is going to take over as reserve currency,” Brian Armstrong, the chief executive of crypto exchange Coinbase, posted to X in comments reposted by Musk. “I love bitcoin, but a strong America is also super important for the world. We need to get our finances under control.” Musk, who last year embarked on a campaign against spiraling U.S. debt while supporting U.S. president Donald Trump’s second bid for the White House, has come out against Trump’s signature tax bill just days after leaving his role in Trump’s administration. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates Trump’s so-called “big, beautiful bill” will add $3.8 trillion to the U.S.’s $36 trillion in debt over the next decade, taking it to an eye-watering $40 trillion. "I’m sorry, but I just can’t stand it anymore," Musk, who set up and led the Doge department of government efficiency, posted to X. “This massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination.” Musk wrote that those who voted for it “know you did wrong," and added in a follow up post that it “will massively increase the already gigantic budget deficit to $2.5 trillion and burden American citizens with crushingly unsustainable debt.” Huge government spending through Covid lockdowns turbo-charged U.S. debt, leading to warnings the Federal Reserve will have to step in to prop up bond markets, devaluing the dollar and potentially spiking inflation. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price rocketed to a fresh all-time high in May, soaring as fears swirl over the health ... More of the U.S. dollar. Bitcoin, a scarce digital asset that’s often compared to gold, has seen its price rocket higher as countries around the world, and led by the U.S., fuel their economic growth with debt. Companies are beginning to shift their corporate treasuries to bitcoin, a trend started by ailing software company MicroStrategy in 2020 that’s propelled it into the Nasdaq 100 and been copied by dozens of companies. “As the U.S. dollar continues to devalue, we’re going to see this shift happening more and more as investors scramble to protect their assets,” Nic Puckrin, bitcoin and crypto analyst, investor and founder of The Coin Bureau, said in emailed comments. “With bitcoin holding steady above $100,000 for 20 days and counting, it’s fast becoming the new safe haven.”

Title: Ethereum’s big moment: Why institutions are betting big on ETH

BlackRock and Fidelity are rotating out of Bitcoin and betting on Ethereum! Ethereum [ETH] is having a moment — and institutions know it. Capital is rotating fast, with giants like BlackRock and Fidelity quietly trimming their Bitcoin [BTC] positions and loading up on ETH. It’s a strategic move, likely in anticipation of long-awaited ETH staking approval. At the same time, social sentiment is buzzing, and whale activity is picking up, all pointing to a market mood that’s increasingly pro-Ethereum… even as some big holders are still underwater. Institutions are making their play, and it’s not Bitcoin they’re betting on! On the 2nd of June alone, BlackRock and Fidelity unloaded a combined $180 million in BTC, as shown in the latest ETF net inflow data. Where did that capital go? Straight into Ethereum. Source: SoSoValue Reports suggest nearly 30,000 ETH — valued around $78 million — were scooped up by the same players. The shift is clear: Institutional capital is front-running a potential ETH staking approval, rotating aggressively into what’s increasingly seen as the future of digital assets. According to Santiment data, for every bearish post on ETH, there are three bullish ones, reflecting a euphoric tone among traders. Source: Santiment In contrast, Bitcoin’s ratio is a modest 1.3:1, suggesting a more cautious outlook. The divergence in mood shows growing confidence in Ethereum’s near-term potential, especially amid ETH staking approval rumors. As the crypto crowd leans into optimism for ETH, the gap in sentiment between the two leading assets continues to widen. Even whales aren’t immune to losses, but their moves still matter. A prominent Ethereum whale, who accumulated over 13,478 ETH ($49M) between December 2024 and January 2025, has recently started offloading ETH to Binance, sending 10,000 ETH ($24.55M) in the last two weeks alone. Source: X Despite a $15.66M loss, the whale still holds 3,478 ETH; suggesting a planned move, not panic. It reflects how big players are repositioning ahead of possible ETH staking approval.

The company behind the second-largest USD-pegged stablecoin by market cap is naming its price for its upcoming US initial public offering (IPO). According to a Reuters report, USDC-issuer Circle says it is aiming for a $7.2 billion valuation in its upcoming IPO – about $28 per share – partially because of the current administration’s friendlier outlook on crypto regulations. US dollar-pegged stablecoins aim to maintain a 1:1 value with the US dollar. Tether’s USDT is the largest USD-pegged stablecoin by market value. Says Chief Investment Officer of Running Point Capital, Michael Ashley Schulman, “Issues regarding memecoin hype and more specifically Trump’s ventures into a namesake coin should not directly affect the outlook for stablecoins backed by hard currency.” According to the widely followed pseudonymous crypto analyst The Flow Horse, the Circle IPO valuation is “cheap.” “Circle IPO seems interesting to me. I think $28 is going to look cheap over a multi-month period. Outside of the initial event volume, I will be looking for price to develop a clean range and ideally start to establish a longer-term position.” Bloomberg reports that BlackRock, the largest asset manager in the world, plans on accumulating 10% of Circle’s shares when they become available on Thursday, June 5. BlackRock is already the acting reserve manager for the assets backing USDC. Generated Image: Midjourney Covering the future of finance, including macro, bitcoin, ethereum, crypto, and web 3.

BlackRock signals $100T advisor interest in Bitcoin market as metrics point to an incoming institutional demand. Bitcoin [BTC] might be preparing for its next big wave of institutional flows. Financial planners with more than $100 trillion in assets under management might get easier access to BTC exposure in the near term, per BlackRock reports. This has infused new bullish sentiment in the market. Institutional demand for Bitcoin is not novel, but they are accelerating rapidly. As regulatory landscapes shift and spot ETFs become more mainstream, advisors now have a more transparent path to including BTC in diversified portfolios. BlackRock’s announcement follows this trend and implies that the next round of demand will come from wealth managers who had been sidelined in the past. The market is responding in real-time. Since big-ticket institutional investment picked pace, Bitcoin Open Interest has recorded a steady and uninterrupted rise. The trend suggests growing confidence among traders that there is a supply-demand gap brewing. Derivative Open Interest is also likely to mirror the volume of money going into options and futures. Its current consistent rise suggests that big institutions are betting on volatility—typically looking forward to a significant price movement. At present, the direction remains bullish. Source: CryptoQuant Alongside the rising Open Interest, Bitcoin’s Funding Rate has also increased. An increasing Funding Rate indicates that more traders are going long—expecting prices to go up. Such a shift usually precedes bullish breakouts, especially if it comes with institutional news. However, increasing Funding Rates can also introduce short-term volatility. Over-enthusiastic longs can lead to steep corrections, but if institutional flows do materialize, dips can be countered by intense buying. Source: CoinGlass Everyone turns to Bitcoin’s supply side these days. With only 21 million coins and dwindling flow from miners following the halving, increased institutional demand may form the foundation of a supply shock. Unlike retail traders, institutions carry long term goals and like to lock up supply. Once advisors who oversee trillions of dollars begin deploying even small percentages of their portfolios into action, supply from exchanges may disappear in a flash, taking BTC further.

American investors exit Bitcoin ETFs while European retail taps into new opportunities. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. US-listed spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have entered a third consecutive day of outflows, shedding more than $1 billion. This trend reflects a shift in institutional sentiment as Bitcoin’s price continues to hover around the $105,000 mark without a clear breakout. Data from SoSoValue shows that the 12 US-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs experienced $268 million in net outflows on June 2 alone. This follows larger exits on May 29 and 30, when the funds collectively lost more than $1 billion. Industry analysts suggest that these outflows are tied to the broader market cooling. Bitcoin’s price has traded in a tight band over the past week, prompting large investors to reduce risk or shift capital to other asset classes. This behavior is common during periods of price consolidation, where expectations of near-term gains are muted. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), the largest Bitcoin ETF in the US, has not been immune to the trend. However, that has not significantly impacted its position among the country’s top 25 largest ETFs. IBIT currently manages over $72 billion in assets. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas highlighted IBIT’s rapid rise in a recent analysis. He noted that at just 1.4 years old, IBIT is the youngest ETF in the top 25, which is significantly younger than any of its peers. Despite Bitcoin’s recent price performance, institutional investors in other jurisdictions remain interested in the flagship digital asset. On June 3, Jacobi Asset Management expanded access to its Bitcoin ETF by removing long-standing investment restrictions. The change allows retail investors in Europe to directly invest in the product, following a decision by Guernsey’s regulator to scrap the professional-only classification and minimum capital requirements. Jacobi CEO Peter Lane welcomed the change, saying: “Our fund was designed from day one with a regulated, institutional-grade structure that investors could trust and were familiar with. Now, with greater regulatory alignment and growing public interest, we’re delighted to expand access to all investors across eligible jurisdictions.” He also praised Guernsey’s proactive approach and expressed optimism about the potential to roll out more regulated crypto investment vehicles soon.

Title: Meta Won’t Add Bitcoin To Balance Sheet As Shareholders Strongly Reject Treasury Proposal
URL: https://zycrypto.com/meta-wont-add-bitcoin-to-balance-sheet-as-shareholders-strongly-reject-treasury-proposal/
Time Published: 2025-06-03T13:50:29Z

Shareholders of Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta have voted against a proposal to consider adding Bitcoin to the company’s balance sheet. According to a May 28 filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, an eye-popping 4.9 billion votes were cast in opposition while 3.92 million — a mere 0.08% of the total — supported the proposal. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg controls 61% of the company’s voting power, an April regulatory statement reveals, which could mean that he voted down the idea. The proposal, submitted in January by Bitcoin champion Ethan Peck, representing the National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR), asked Meta to convert a portion of its $72 billion in excess cash and cash equivalents into the apex crypto to better preserve shareholder value. The measure touted Bitcoin, with its fixed supply and strong past performance compared to bonds, as a more reliable long-term store of value. Peck claimed that the tech giant should treat the largest crypto as a strategic reserve asset, similar to a corporate war chest designed to endure monetary policy uncertainty. He also pointed out that Meta’s second-largest shareholder, BlackRock, advised that a 2% Bitcoin allocation is reasonable. While Meta doesn’t want to hold crypto on its balance sheet, the firm has previously dipped its toes into blockchain. In June 2019, it unveiled Libra, a global stablecoin project backed by a basket of fiat currencies. That project collapsed in 2022 after unwelcome regulatory scrutiny and internal wrangles, rebranding briefly as Diem before shutting down and selling assets to crypto bank Silvergate. Peck also submitted similar Bitcoin treasury proposals to Microsoft and Amazon on behalf of the conservative think tank NCPPR. Microsoft shareholders voted against the plan in December, while Amazon shareholders are awaiting a vote on whether to put at least 5% of the company’s assets into Bitcoin. Though Bitcoin treasury proposals were rejected by Meta and Microsoft, global publicly listed companies continue accumulating the flagship crypto. Data tracked by Bitcoin Treasuries shows that over 115 public companies have added Bitcoin to their balance sheets, with one of the newest entrants being GameStop. Michael Saylor’s Strategy leads all publicly traded firms with 580,955 BTC, worth over $60 billion, while eight others, including Marathon Digital Holdings and Elon Musk’s Tesla, each hold roughly $1 billion worth of Bitcoin.

Sberbank, Russia’s largest bank, has started offering a new bond product tied to Bitcoin’s price. Based on reports, only qualified investors can buy these bonds right now, and trading happens over the counter. The bank says it will soon list them on the Moscow Exchange to make them easier to buy and sell. These bonds pay out if Bitcoin rises in value, and they also give investors a bonus if the US dollar strengthens against the ruble. Investors deal in rubles, so there’s no need to own a crypto wallet or use foreign platforms. According to the bank’s press release, the bonds are for a limited group of investors at first. They plan to make them available on the Moscow Exchange soon. This move means more transparency and the chance for more people to get involved. If Bitcoin goes up, bondholders benefit. If the dollar goes up against the ruble, bondholders get a bit more too. It’s a double play on two markets, crypto and currency. Based on reports, Russia still bans cryptocurrencies for everyday payments, but they’re allowed for cross-border deals. In early June, the Central Bank of Russia gave financial firms the green light to sell crypto-related investments to qualified investors. That change paved the way for Sberbank’s new bonds. No one needs to leave Russia’s financial system to invest in Bitcoin this way, keeping it all above board and legal. Sberbank got a digital asset license from the Central Bank in 2022. Since then, they’ve tokenized assets like gold and real estate. They opened their platform to retail investors in 2023 and handled billions of rubles in transactions. The bank even launched a blockchain network that works with Ethereum. That network started limited testing in 2022 and opened to the public in early 2023. Now, they’re adding Bitcoin futures on June 4 through their SberInvestments platform. This comes just as the Moscow Exchange rolls out its own crypto-based trading tools. Around the world, big banks are moving into crypto. In the US, names like JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and Citigroup are working on a stablecoin project to speed up cross-border payments. In Hong Kong, HSBC launched a crypto settlement product. BNY Mellon is putting money into blockchain to hold digital assets. In March, BlackRock created a tokenized fund on Ethereum and then added one on Solana. Sberbank’s bond ties into this trend, showing that major banks still see value in blending traditional finance with crypto tools.

Title: BlackRock Analyst Warns of Overexposure to US Markets, Says One Country On Right Side of Incoming ‘Tectonic Shifts’

The world’s largest asset manager says investors may want to think twice before betting the farm on US markets. In an interview with CNBC TV-18, Ben Powell, chief of Middle East & APAC at BlackRock Investment Institute, says he’s looking at other regions to invest in as uncertainty builds in the US due to a weakening dollar and trade tensions. Says Powell, “Having all your eggs in one basket, even a beautiful basket like the US, feels a bit riskier.” The analyst says BlackRock is looking at emerging markets like India as potential candidates to outperform the US, noting strong labor force growth, technology gains, heightened geopolitical relevance and favorable demographic trends. “We like India, yes. We think India is the right side of a lot of these huge tectonic shifts that we’re seeing. So India, in terms of the geopolitics… Clearly, India is of course a kind of continent-sized country and economy, and everyone wants to be friends with India. It’s neck and neck at the moment but potentially India’s GDP will be overtaking Japan’s relatively soon in the next few quarters… And I still think, if I can say so, what some of the foreigners still fail to understand is the amazing technological productivity advances we’ve seen in India over the last years.” However, Powell also concedes that BlackRock is still overweight US equities and doesn’t discount the possibility that the American stock market can rip higher from here, noting that artificial intelligence (AI) can be the “megaforce” that can act as a tailwind that offsets other concerns in the market.

Key Takeaways Neuralink, Elon Musk’s brain-computer interface startup, has successfully closed its Series E funding round, securing an impressive $650 million. The round attracted a powerhouse roster of investors, including ARK Invest, DFJ Growth, Founders Fund, G42, Human Capital, Lightspeed, QIA, Sequoia Capital, Thrive Capital, Valor Equity Partners, and Vy Capital. The figure represents a significant jump from its Series D funding round in August 2023, which raised $280M and an additional $43M coming in November of the same year. In a company blog post, they announced that it has made ‘significant progress’ in building brain interfaces that help restore independence in paralyzed humans. It listed the five individuals now using Neuralink to control devices, the launch of its global clinical trials, the addition of use cases beyond its original intent, and expanding the number of neurons and brain regions its device interacts with among its achievements since 2023. The company has three human patients with ‘Link’, its brain implant. It allows these paralyzed patients to operate phones and computers using their thoughts, which Neuralink calls ‘Telepathy’. The first two patients, Noland Arbaugh and Alex, are paralyzed by spinal cord injuries. But with Neuralink’s help, they have been able to control computers, with Arbaugh using the implant to control the mouse and keyboard, and Alex being able to play Counter-Strike. Another Neuralink patient is Brad Smith, who has amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Having the implant allowed him to ‘speak’ by controlling the mouse and keyboard to type on a computer screen or choose a reply. The message is then output as audio of his voice cloned by AI from samples before he lost his ability to speak due to ALS. As volunteers who participated in the company’s PRIME Study, the three have used Link for 670 days and employed Telepathy to communicate for over 4.9K hours. Founded in 2016 by Musk and a team of scientists and engineers, Neuralink went mainstream the following year after a report from The Wall Street Journal. It was still unclear what products the company might create back then, but there had already been speculations about developing brain implants to treat brain disorders. By 2019, the company raised $158M, with $100M coming from Musk. During this time, Neuralink revealed that it was developing a device similar to a sewing machine that could implant thin threads into the brain. Plans to conduct human trials were scheduled in 2020, but they only received FDA approval in 2023. Arbaugh became the first human to receive the Link implant the following year. However, Neuralink hasn’t been without controversy. A 2022 report by Fortune revealed the departure of most of its founding team, citing internal tensions and concerns over erratic leadership. The article also raised red flags about the company potentially overstating its technological capabilities. In addition, the company faced a probe from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2022 over the higher-than-normal deaths in its animal tests. While Neuralink is perhaps the most familiar name in the world of brain implants, other companies also share the same goal as Musk’s. For one, there’s Peter Thiel-backed Blackrock Neurotech, which has already conducted trials on over 30 individuals worldwide. Another notable player is Precision Neuroscience, co-founded in 2021 by Benjamin Rappaport, also a Neuralink co-founder. The company recently secured FDA approval to trial its brain-computer interface, allowing temporary implantation in patients for up to 30 days. Overall, this healthy competition among well-funded companies could bode well for paralyzed patients or those suffering from brain disorders. That said, these implants’ viability and widespread use may still be decades away, after which we may have to contend with their potential ethical issues. As technology continues to evolve—from the return of 'dumbphones' to faster and sleeker computers—seasoned tech journalist, Cedric Solidon, continues to dedicate himself to writing stories that inform, empower, and connect with readers across all levels of digital literacy. Read more With 20 years of professional writing experience, this University of the Philippines Journalism graduate has carved out a niche as a trusted voice in tech media. Whether he's breaking down the latest advancements in cybersecurity or explaining how silicon-carbon batteries can extend your phone’s battery life, his writing remains rooted in clarity, curiosity, and utility. Long before he was writing for Techreport, HP, Citrix, SAP, Globe Telecom, CyberGhost VPN, and ExpressVPN, Cedric's love for technology began at home courtesy of a Nintendo Family Computer and a stack of tech magazines. Growing up, his days were often filled with sessions of Contra, Bomberman, Red Alert 2, and the criminally underrated Crusader: No Regret. But gaming wasn't his only gateway to tech. He devoured every T3, PCMag, and PC Gamer issue he could get his hands on, often reading them cover to cover. It wasn’t long before he explored the early web in IRC chatrooms, online forums, and fledgling tech blogs, soaking in every byte of knowledge from the late '90s and early 2000s internet boom. That fascination with tech didn’t just stick. It evolved into a full-blown calling. After graduating with a degree in Journalism, he began his writing career at the dawn of Web 2.0. What started with small editorial roles and freelance gigs soon grew into a full-fledged career. He has since collaborated with global tech leaders, lending his voice to content that bridges technical expertise with everyday usability. He’s also written annual reports for Globe Telecom and consumer-friendly guides for VPN companies like CyberGhost and ExpressVPN, empowering readers to understand the importance of digital privacy. His versatility spans not just tech journalism but also technical writing. He once worked with a local tech company developing web and mobile apps for logistics firms, crafting documentation and communication materials that brought together user-friendliness with deep technical understanding. That experience sharpened his ability to break down dense, often jargon-heavy material into content that speaks clearly to both developers and decision-makers. At the heart of his work lies a simple belief: technology should feel empowering, not intimidating. Even if the likes of smartphones and AI are now commonplace, he understands that there's still a knowledge gap, especially when it comes to hardware or the real-world benefits of new tools. His writing hopes to help close that gap. Cedric’s writing style reflects that mission. It’s friendly without being fluffy and informative without being overwhelming. Whether writing for seasoned IT professionals or casual readers curious about the latest gadgets, he focuses on how a piece of technology can improve our lives, boost our productivity, or make our work more efficient. That human-first approach makes his content feel more like a conversation than a technical manual. As his writing career progresses, his passion for tech journalism remains as strong as ever. With the growing need for accessible, responsible tech communication, he sees his role not just as a journalist but as a guide who helps readers navigate a digital world that’s often as confusing as it is exciting.

Title: Is Altcoin Season Over Or It Never Started? Here’s What Historical Data Says
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/is-altcoin-season-over-data/
Time Published: 2025-06-03T10:00:39Z
Full Content:
Following the explosive 2021 Bitcoin and crypto bull run, the expectations of an “altcoin season” have become even more pronounced. This term refers to a period where the prices of altcoins rise rapidly and outperform the Bitcoin price by a large margin. Usually, this happens after the Bitcoin price has put in a new all-time high, and money is rotated into altcoins. However, this has not been the case this cycle. So what happened to altcoin season? Crypto analyst and expert Michaël van de Poppe took to the X (formerly Twitter) platform to share with his over 790,000 followers that the altcoin season has yet to begin. This goes against the widespread belief that the altcoin season has already come and gone, and is officially over. According to van de Poppe, the altcoin market is actually still in a bear market, but it is about to end. The analyst’s prediction comes as the Bitcoin price remains above six figures, and yet the altcoin market continues to struggle close to its lows. Despite the abysmal market movement and the massive decline in positive sentiment, the crypto analyst still believes that the best is yet to come. He predicts that the crypto bull market is about to begin, and this would be bigger than ever because the bear market has gone on for so long. Furthermore, he points out that this cycle is different than previous cycles and the next 1-3 years will be different as well. Thus, he predicts many investors will miss it for being impatient. Using the chart above, which was created by crypto analyst TechDev, van de Poppe shows that the altcoin market is at a pivotal point. It shows a period where the Bitcoin price is rising and altcoins have remained flat. However, this has usually turned out to be the calm before the storm, and altcoin season tends to follow. If the analyst is right, then the altcoin season never started, and is still in the future. As Michaël van de Poppe mentioned, this cycle has been quite different from the previous one, and there have been a few reasons for this. The first is the advent of large buys from institutions such as Michael Saylor’s Strategy and heavy hitters like BlackRock buying up Bitcoin through exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The natural consequence of this is that money is now only staying in Bitcoin rather than rotating out at the top into altcoins like last cycle. Also, a big difference between the current cycle and the 2020-2021 cycle is the availability of free cash. Following the COVID-19 lockdown of 2020, governments around the world disbursed billions of dollars to citizens to help them weather the storm, and this ‘free cash’ had inadvertently found its way into the market, triggering a massive altcoin season. Other factors that have been pointed out to have contributed to this are the extreme P2P that emerged with the advent of instant meme coin creations. Thousands of new coins flood the market daily, and this has left liquidity spread thin. Also, broader macroeconomic factors such as Donald Trump’s tariff wars have contributed greatly to keeping market performance muted, and the weaker altcoins have suffered more for it.

Title: Henry Holterman: The Dutch midas strikes €1 billion gold vein in Greece (pics)

Full Content:
Henry Holterman is a numbers man.In this invisible but foundational realm, there is no room for misinterpretations or emotion. Based purely on numbers, the Dutch investor ranks among the most successful dealmakers in Greece over recent decades. From the recent sale of his 9.75% stake in Alpha Bank to profitable deals in GEK TERNA and Ellaktor, and the capital gains—both visible and hidden—from his investments in Greece, it’s estimated that he has earned close to €1 billion to date. An impressive figure, but fully justified.Those who know him describe a highly disciplined investor with clear targets and a unique ability to spot undervalued assets, investing without loans or leverage. In every investment move he made in Greece, those who engaged with him confirm he is laser-focused on results, unaffected by emotion or ego—even during the toughest business clashes. It’s just business, with the goal of maximizing profit. If others win along the way, great—but that’s not the goal. Obstacles are seen as opportunities to revise strategy and seek alternative paths to a successful exit—no matter how long it takes. Ellaktor and GEK TERNAHis investment principles are reflected in his every move. In early 2018, amid the shareholder civil war in Ellaktor, Holterman flew to Athens in his private jet, invited by the Kallitsantsis brothers seeking backing for their upcoming proxy battle to oust the existing board of the historic construction group. Though the discussions led nowhere—just like the attempt to acquire Forthnet alongside Odyssey-Athena—a new opportunity had already arisen, leading to a 10%, then 30% stake in GEK TERNA. He eventually exited the group of Mr. George Peristeris with an estimated €200 million in returns. Armed with fresh capital, he entered Ellaktor and, after more than two years of fierce rivalry—first with the Kallitsantsis side, then with the Kaymenakis–Bakou–Exarchos trio—he prevailed, having also forged a strong alliance with the Vardinogiannis group. In Alpha BankNext came the divestment of Ellaktor’s assets, executed with mathematical precision. In 2021, while Greece’s investment-grade rating was still a distant dream, he invested in Alpha Bank. While analysts speculated he might become a banker and increase his stake in the bank, he correctly read the signals and chose to sell—earning over €340 million. He still holds a 3.95% stake in Optima Bank, purchased during its public offering for €21 million, now valued at €60 million. A Dutch… DreamHolterman could be seen as the epitome of the “Dutch dream”—a twist on the more familiar “American dream.” Yet, his story is cinematic in nature. Born in 1955, he began as a certified auditor. Legend has it that he was assigned to audit VolkerWessels, one of the Netherlands’ oldest and largest construction groups, whose investment arm is Reggeborgh. During this time, he met and married Herita, one of two daughters of owner Dick Wessels. Wessels himself came from humble beginnings, working in his father Arend’s carpentry business founded in 1933. In 1968, at 22, he took over the company and turned it into one of Europe’s major construction groups. By 2017, when Wessels passed away, he was the third richest Dutchman, with an estimated fortune of €4 billion. Holterman took over the family business empire that year. Reggeborgh’s PowerFounded in 1990 to manage the Wessels family’s investments, Reggeborgh today holds over 20 companies spanning infrastructure, real estate, energy, medical research, and tech across Europe and the U.S. Among its assets: Koninklijke VolkerWessels, DW Property, Prescan, Tesorion, and EVI. The family’s net worth is estimated at €15–20 billion. The Dutch investment fund also has significant equity holdings, most notably a 3.04% stake in ABN Amro, making it the bank’s fifth-largest shareholder behind the Dutch government, MFS Investment Management, Norway’s NBIM, and BlackRock. It previously sold its 17.6% stake in Van Lanschot Kempen to ING. The World Online AffairThose who know Holterman call him a “player”—a label that can mean many things in Greek, but in his case, it’s quite literal: he has a passion for stock market investments. One such investment tested him, but he emerged stronger and richer. Reggeborgh was among the early investors in tech firm World Online, holding a significant stake at its IPO in 2000. But the stock crashed post-IPO, causing massive investor losses. Reggeborgh escaped unharmed, having sold its shares beforehand. The saga had legal implications. The company’s founder, Nina Brink (also known as Nina Storms), claimed €182 million from Reggeborgh, alleging it owed her per a private agreement. The dispute lasted nearly two decades and was settled out of court. Holterman always maintained that no illegal acts occurred and blamed investor over-expectations for the fallout. Under Holterman, the Wessels family office made other lucrative moves—including in fiber-optic firms Reggefiber and Eurofiber, and the investment bank NIBC—despite regulatory scrutiny. It All Began in CorfuAround this time, Greece entered Holterman’s life—more specifically, Corfu. Neither he nor anyone else could have predicted that Greece would yield €1 billion in capital gains. Roughly 25 years ago, he and his wife Herita bought a vacation home in Kassiopi, a stunning part of northern Corfu. The area is home to luxury villas owned by the Rothschilds, Jörg Rockenhäuser (Permira), Rob Lucas (CVC Capital), and other ultra-wealthy investors. It was during this time he met Nikos Dendias, then a well-known lawyer in Corfu—long before entering politics. Dendias’ firm has handled many of Holterman’s affairs in Greece, where he has been remarkably active as an investor. Corfu: His Island LoveHolterman’s bond with Corfu only grew stronger. He bought a dream villa in Kommeno, and nearly every summer enjoys the island’s beauty and refined cuisine. From his villa, he overlooks Gouvia Bay, often crossed by the yacht “Guilty” belonging to the Ioannou family. Holterman himself once owned the 47-meter yacht “Lars”, built by Italy’s Sanlorenzo shipyard. He later put it up for sale for €24 million, eventually selling it for an undisclosed amount. Unlike the sea, it seems land is Holterman’s true love. His properties in Corfu and Athens mirror his investment philosophy: prime real estate with hidden value waiting to be unlocked. A striking example is the historic Corfu Palace Hotel, which he reportedly acquired for €30 million from the Fokas family. Opened in 1962, the hotel had seen both glory and decline, in need of major renovations that were always partial and never complete. Now under Holterman’s ownership, it’s undergoing a full €20 million renovation, aiming to reopen in 2026 as a key player in Corfu’s luxury hospitality scene. More Real Estate MovesTwo years ago, he also bought a neoclassical building two blocks from Corfu Palace with views of Garitsa Bay, 1,000 square meters in total, for over €2 million. Five years ago, he reportedly acquired the famous “Red House” (Antico Rosso) for €8 million. This stunning 17th-century mansion, built on the ruins of a 13th-century monastery, once belonged to the Kourkoumelis-Rodostamos family—one of Corfu’s oldest and linked by marriage to the Kapodistrias lineage. Locals say Holterman has truly fallen for Corfu. He has made donations to the island’s hospital, coast guard, police, supported the “Melissa” disability center, EKAV, and other nonprofits, sports clubs, and federations—often via Ellaktor. In 2022, Holterman, his wife, and son were honorarily granted Greek citizenship. What’s Next?Corfu isn’t his only turf. Holterman has also built a significant real estate portfolio in Athens. Real estate insiders say REDS paid €80 million to acquire Athens Properties from Holding Greece B.V., managed by the Holterman family. The Hestia Luxury Apartments brand, part of Athens Properties B.V., manages 10 fully renovated buildings in prime locations. Other properties across Greece remain under his ownership—though not all are publicly known. Explore related questions

Title: I’m Very Glad That New York Has Ranked-Choice Voting

Forgot Your Password? New to The Nation? Subscribe Print subscriber? Activate your online access I can vote for two candidates—Zohran Mamdani and Brad Lander—who’ve made climate a cornerstone of their campaigns, with real hopes that one or the other will prevail. I was lucky enough as a young reporter to find myself covering elections in the only city in America that chose its leaders via ranked-choice voting (RCV). This was… a long time ago, and so it all happened on paper: Cambridge voters listed city councilor candidates, sometimes twenty or more, in order of preference, and then, over the course of a week, teams of older ladies physically distributed the ballots around an elementary school gymnasium. As candidate X with the lowest number of first place votes was disqualified, they would carry his ballots to the piles of the candidate listed second, and so on until only the winner remained. All of this happens by computer now, in a burp. But it remains a splendid system. Usually people defend it on the correct grounds that you can vote for a third-party candidate without losing your vote—should they be eliminated, your ballot will go to your next-favorite choice. But there’s also the benefit that two good but similar candidates—the Bernie/Warren problem—don’t split the progressive vote. I’ve long ago left New York City for the northern mountains, but I continue to follow its politics, in large part because they’re so important to the world. The city’s vast public pension fund, for instance, has been used in recent years to help advance the fight against climate change, more skillfully than most such instruments, and I’d like to see that continue. And New York’s sheer vastness and dynamism means it’s a great place to help lead the fight for change: the current effort, for instance, to refurbish large buildings to make them more efficient is showing the rest of the country what can be done. So I’m very glad that New York has RCV, which means you can vote for two candidates who’ve made climate a cornerstone of their campaigns, with real hopes that one or the other will prevail. Zohran Mamdani, the young progressive who seems to be consolidating left votes, led the fight against a fracked gas power plant in his home turf of Astoria. He didn’t just say the right words—he mobilized an impressive fight to get it done. Brad Lander, meanwhile, the city’s current comptroller, did something of inordinate value last month, standing up to Blackrock, which is essentially the same thing as standing up to capitalism. The financial giant needed to do some very specific things to start addressing the climate crisis, he said, or they would find themselves without New York’s hundreds of billions of dollars—this is at last the blue state equivalent of what red state treasurers have spent the last few years doing, which is intimidating the world’s financial powers. (Here’s the Financial Times >attesting to the global importance of his courage). What I’m saying is, if your interest is the planet, both candidates have things to recommend them. Probably I’d vote Lander 1 and Mamdani 2, because I like kicking Big Money in the nuts more than anything else; maybe, when I walked into the booth, I’d switch those two on the grounds that younger is better. Maybe I’d argue myself out of that on the (somewhat sentimental) grounds that it’s hard to imagine New York without at least one representative of the liberal Jewish political heritage that’s done so much for us all, or on the slightly solider reasoning that New York’s vast bureaucracy might be less intimidating to someone who’s spent more time in it. The point is, New Yorkers have a less excruciating choice than most of us in these situations. They don’t have to pretend they don’t have two excellent candidates (and actually several others). But remember—you don’t have to rank any more candidates than you want to. You also get the pleasure of leaving Eric Adams and Andrew Cuomo off your ballot, a satisfying (and electorally useful) dis that too few American voters are privileged to enjoy. The slow spread of RCV is one of the life rings we can toss to try to rescue our drowning national politics. For now, enjoy it, you lucky New Yorkers!

East Asia Zheng Yanxiong, director of China's Hong Kong Liaison Office, speaks during the National Security Education Day opening ceremony in Hong Kong, China on Apr 15, 2024. (File photo: REUTERS/Lam Yik) HONG KONG: Hong Kong's leader, John Lee, said on Tuesday (Jun 3) that China's recent removal of its top representative in the city, known for his hardline policies on national security, had been a "normal" personnel change. In a surprise development, China announced late on Friday that Zheng Yanxiong, the director of China's Liaison Office in Hong Kong - Beijing's main representative office in the city with powerful oversight over local affairs - had been "removed" from his post. He was replaced by Zhou Ji, a senior official with the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office on the State Council.

CK Hutchison's ports deal has been criticised in Chinese state media as "betraying" China's interests and bowing to US political pressure. The conglomerate, controlled by tycoon Li Ka-shing, agreed in March to sell the majority of its US$22.8 billion global ports business, including assets along the strategically significant Panama Canal, to the consortium. The consortium is now being led by another member – Terminal Investment Limited, which is majority-owned by Italian billionaire Gianluigi Aponte's family-run MSC Mediterranean Shipping Company. The deal is still being negotiated. Asked whether Zheng's removal reflected a pivot by Beijing towards economic development from national security, Lee said Hong Kong still needed to pursue both. "Hong Kong faces a stage where development and safety must be addressed at the same time because any development must have a safe environment." China promulgated a powerful national security law in 2020, arresting scores of opposition democrats and activists, shuttering liberal media outlets and civil society groups and punishing free speech with sedition – moves that have drawn international criticism.

Title: Executive Incentives Under Common Ownership
URL: https://clsbluesky.law.columbia.edu/2025/06/03/executive-incentives-under-common-ownership/
Time Published: 2025-06-03T04:05:52Z
Full Content:
In recent years, legal scholars and economists have debated whether the rise of “common ownership” by large institutional investors dampens competition. The concern is that when asset managers such as the Big Three – BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street – hold stakes in multiple competing companies, they might encourage those firms to compete less aggressively with one another or even collude. One way asset managers might soften competition is through executive compensation: Common owners could restructure executive pay packages at the companies they own to blunt incentives for cut‑throat competition. Common owners might discourage relative performance evaluation (RPE), a popular pay practice that rewards executives for outperforming peers. A typical RPE award pays top managers more, whether in cash or shares, when their firm outperforms rivals on metrics such as return on equity or total shareholder return. RPE therefore aligns pay with competitive success and motivates managers to vie fiercely against competitors. Eliminating or weakening RPE could, in principle, enable tacit collusion and allow commonly owned firms to earn higher profits than they would in a fully competitive market. In a recent paper, I test whether common owners reduce RPE at their portfolio firms and find clear evidence to the contrary. In fact, the Big Three exhibit strong preferences for RPE. I find evidence of this on three levels. First, more common ownership, measured by how many industry peers share institutional owners, does not lead to reduced RPE use. Instead, firms with greater ownership stakes held directly by the Big Three are significantly more likely to adopt RPE. This positive effect persists even when the Big Three own stakes in multiple competing firms, directly contradicting the anti-competitive narrative. Furthermore, the prevalence of RPE increased substantially during my study’s sample period, from under one-third of firms using RPE in 2010 to nearly two-thirds by 2021, precisely as the Big Three’s market influence was growing. Second, I analyze shareholder voting behavior on executive pay (“say-on-pay”) proposals. If common owners sought to reduce competition through executive incentives, they would likely voice support for compensation packages without RPE. Instead, my findings indicate that firms receive greater shareholder support, especially from the Big Three, when their pay packages include explicit RPE measures. Third, I explore whether common ownership affects firms’ choice of performance benchmarks, another subtle avenue to reduce competitive pressures. The results show the opposite: Firms with significant Big Three ownership tend to choose closely competing companies as performance benchmarks, not avoiding but rather enhancing competitive pressure. Combining these findings, the paper’s core message is that common ownership has not led to weaker executive incentives for competition. Across multiple dimensions, including whether a firm adopts RPE, how shareholders vote on pay, and how peer groups are constructed, there is no support for the idea that common owners encourage collusion through CEO pay design. If anything, the influence of the largest common owners (the Big Three) is associated with more performance-based pay and thus potentially more competition among portfolio companies, not less. Why do the Big Three support RPE in executive compensation? One explanation is that, in their stewardship roles, they generally advocate for robust pay-for-performance systems because these incentives align executives’ interests closely with long-term value creation. By linking executive compensation to relative performance, the Big Three can effectively hold executives accountable, ensuring firms strive for superior operational and financial results. Another plausible explanation is reputational: Given heightened regulatory and public scrutiny of their market power and influence, the Big Three may adopt a “blue sky” approach, endorsing transparent, competitive compensation structures like RPE to avoid any perception of collusion or conflicts of interest. By publicly supporting rigorous performance evaluation, these asset managers signal their commitment to fair competition and governance best practices. From a policy perspective, these findings caution against heavy-handed regulatory interventions targeting common ownership, such as mandated divestitures or stringent antitrust constraints. Regulatory actions undertaken without clear evidence of anti-competitive harm could inadvertently disrupt beneficial governance practices, including effective executive incentive structures like RPE. Worse yet, such interventions might ultimately harm the millions of investors who rely on institutional asset managers for financial goals like retirement. Instead, policy should focus on enhancing transparency and accountability among large institutional investors, avoiding blanket restrictions that could unintentionally undermine their positive societal contributions. My paper also makes an important technical contribution: Researchers should not treat institutional investors as a monolith, especially when studying common ownership. Regressing an RPE dummy on aggregate Direct Ownership and aggregate Common Ownership yields positive and statistically significant coefficients on the latter, but this is due to omitted variable bias. Separating these measures into four distinct categories, Big Three Direct Ownership, Big Three Common Ownership, Other Direct Ownership, and Other Common Ownership, reveals the true relationships. Regressing RPE on these four measures produces positive and statistically significant coefficients on Big Three Direct Ownership and small, statistically insignificant coefficients on the remaining three. Thus, researchers must consider the composition of institutional investors to avoid misattributing the effects of large asset managers such as the Big Three to common ownership. My study demonstrates that fears regarding common ownership’s anti-competitive effects are likely overstated. Instead, large institutional investors, particularly the Big Three, play a constructive role in corporate governance by advocating for stronger performance-based executive pay structures that enhance rather than diminish competition. This post comes to us from Professor Thomas Schneider at the University of Oklahoma, Price College of Business. It is based on his recent paper, “Executive Incentives Under Common Ownership,” forthcoming in the Journal of Corporate Finance, special issue on Statistically Non-significant Results in Financial Economics, and available here.

Title: Circle Going Public On June 4: What Future For The CRCL?

More this illustration photo taken in Krakow, Poland on June 10, 2022. (Photo by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images) One of the most anticipated events in crypto business this year is set for Wednesday. Circle, the company behind USDC—the world’s second-largest stablecoin—is going public on the New York Stock Exchange. It will offer 32 million Class A shares at a range of $27-28 under the ticker CRCL, aiming for a $7.2 billion valuation. Circle may seem like an easy bet: issue stablecoins, invest the reserves in Treasuries, and earn risk-free yield while users essentially lend their dollars interest-free. But behind this seemingly simple model lies a more complex and vulnerable business. The future of interest rates remains uncertain, margins are split, and partnerships are costly. In a winner-takes-most market, Circle must outpace the impact of potentially falling rates by capturing a larger share of the stablecoin market—or simply by growing with it. Additionally, the firm’s long-term success may also depend on its ability to diversify and build synergy across its products. Stablecoins have quietly become the backbone of crypto markets—and are increasingly relevant for traditional finance. In 2024, stablecoin transaction volume reached $27.6 trillion, overtaking the combined volume of Visa and Mastercard by almost 8%. The total stablecoin market cap now stands at $248 billion. Circle’s USDC holds a 25% share—second only to Tether’s USDT at 61%—and accounts for $60 billion of the total. Circle’s EURC leads among euro-backed stablecoins with a $224 million market cap. USD-pegged stablecoin supply. Source: DefiLlama Where Circle stands out is in regulatory compliance. In the U.S., USDC has positioned itself as a compliant bridge between the crypto ecosystem and traditional finance. In the EU, the implementation of MiCA—and the resulting delisting of non-compliant stablecoins like USDT from major regulated exchanges—has paved the way for USDC to become the region’s leading stablecoin. Citi’s recent report estimates that the stablecoin market could reach a size of $1.6 trillion by 2030 in its base case. Circle, with its compliance-first approach, is well positioned to benefit. Circle’s main revenue stream — 99% of it — comes from investing stablecoin reserves, primarily in short-term U.S. Treasuries. In 2024, this model proved highly lucrative, generating roughly $1.6 billion in interest income. However, that reliance also exposes a risk of over-dependence on interest rates. As Todd H. Baker, a senior fellow at Columbia University, wrote in the Financial Times, Another concern is distribution cost. Of Circle’s $1.6 billion revenue, over $1 billion went to “distribution, transaction, and other costs,” according to the company’s S-1 filing. The bulk of that went to Coinbase—Circle’s former USDC co-manager and now a key partner. Circle consolidated statements of operations, Circle S-1 filing. Source: SEC After dissolving the Centre Consortium in 2023, Circle took full control of USDC in exchange for a new revenue-sharing agreement. Under this deal, Coinbase receives 50% of the residual yield from USDC reserves and 100% of the interest generated by USDC balances held on its platform. In return, Coinbase pledged to “support USDC” and “help drive long-term success of the stablecoin ecosystem.” As per Coinbase’s 2024 report, the agreement runs for an initial term of three years. After that, Coinbase and Circle will “discuss in good faith whether any modifications to the Circle Agreement are warranted.” If no new terms are agreed upon, the deal automatically renews for another three years—unless either side fails to meet its obligations. With most of its revenue linked to interest rates and a significant share going to Coinbase, Circle’s long-term prospects could increasingly depend on its ability to diversify. And the diversification effort seems to be underway. Beyond USDC and EURC stablecoins, Circle offers: While revenues from CPN and USYC weren’t included in the S-1 (both too recent), they could effectively diversify Circle’s revenue streams. The CPN in particular could evolve into a blockchain-native alternative to SWIFT—one that’s programmable, compliance-aware, and built for 24/7 financial infrastructure. It’s a compelling bet in a payments market estimated at around $2 trillion annually, as per BCG. USYC, meanwhile, enters the booming market of yield-bearing stablecoins and tokenized treasuries. Assets in such products surged 490% in 2024—from $1.4 billion to $8.25 billion—and now approach $10 billion, according to Stablewatch. In the segment led by BlackRock-backed Ethena’s sUSDe and Sky’s (formerly MakerDAO) sUSDS and sDAI, USYC is still a minor player, holding 4% of the market. Yield-bearing stablecoins (market cap over $40M). Source: Stablewatch Investors appear to think so. According to Bloomberg, Circle’s IPO was already significantly oversubscribed by May 28. Today, the company responded by increasing its valuation target from previously announced $5.65 billion to $7.2 billion. The investors might be onto something. Stablecoins are becoming the de facto digital dollars—especially in a U.S. environment increasingly hostile to CBDCs. Their addressable market spans global remittances, institutional payments, and DeFi integrations. The infrastructure and regulatory positioning that Circle has built could give it a head start, even as traditional giants like JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, and Citi intend to conceive their own stablecoin. As Benjamin Billarant, founder of Balthazar Capital—an asset management firm with strong exposure to crypto-related equities—commented, Indeed, the bipartisan GENIUS Act—America’s most comprehensive stablecoin bill yet—passed the Senate on May 21 and now heads to the House. Following the vote, President Trump's Crypto Czar David Sacks said that the GENIUS Act will "pass with significant bipartisan support." The timing couldn’t be better for Circle’s IPO indeed. All in all, Circle isn’t just a bet on interest rates—it’s a bet on the future of regulated crypto finance. With stablecoin adoption growing and a compliance-first model, Circle could become a key pillar of tomorrow’s payment system. For $CRCL holders, the challenge will be navigating the gradual shift from "easy" rate-driven gains to a more demanding reliance on product-driven revenue. Whether Circle can evolve in time is the question the IPO asks—and the market will soon answer.

Tuesday, 03 Jun 2025 NEW YORK, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Leading U.S. investment company BlackRock Inc. is ramping up plans to offer more of its private-market products to individuals outside the United States as the Wall Street giant increasingly tries to muscle in on one of the hottest areas in global finance, reported Bloomberg News on Monday. "The world's largest asset manager is targeting a hiring drive and tie-ups with digital investment platforms in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region to boost individual investors' access to its private-markets products," BlackRock executive Fabio Osta was quoted as saying. "We'll continue expanding," said Osta, head of BlackRock's alternative-specialists team for its EMEA wealth unit, declining to specify recruiting targets. "We want more people in private markets." "BlackRock, a pioneer in providing low-cost stock and bond funds, is betting it can conquer a more opaque and exclusive part of finance by homing in on private markets, where longtime leveraged-buyout titans such as Blackstone Inc. and KKR & Co. traditionally dominate," the report noted.

Title: Circle boosts IPO amid strong investor interest, eyes $7.2B valuation

Circle eyes $896 million from updated IPO as institutional giants like BlackRock join the fray. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Circle, the company behind the USDC stablecoin, has revised its IPO filing to reflect stronger-than-expected investor demand, according to a June 2 filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The updated filing shows Circle now plans to issue 32 million Class A shares, up from the previously announced 24 million. It also raised its proposed price range to between $27 and $28 per share, compared to the initial $24 to $26 range. If the final pricing lands at the top end, Circle could raise up to $896 million, which is roughly 44% more than the original estimate of $624 million. This adjustment would also push the company’s valuation to approximately $7.2 billion on a fully diluted basis, up from the earlier $6 billion target. The offering marks a key milestone for the company as it looks to strengthen its standing in the digital finance landscape. USDC, Circle’s flagship stablecoin, is the second-largest dollar-pegged token globally, with a market cap exceeding $61 billion. Circle’s decision to expand the IPO comes amid rising institutional interest in stablecoins and growing regulatory clarity. Market analysts say the stablecoin sector, long considered a niche industry, is entering a new phase of mainstream relevance due to its rising adoption and trust beyond the crypto-native crowd. As a result, legacy financial institutions like JPMorgan, Citigroup, and others are warming up to stablecoins by exploring a jointly issued dollar-backed asset. Another substantial evidence of institutional interest in stablecoins is that BlackRock, the world’s biggest asset manager, is one of the largest potential buyers of Circle’s stock. Sources familiar with the matter say BlackRock intends to purchase roughly 10% of the IPO shares. If that plan materializes, it would further deepen the relationship between the two firms. BlackRock already plays a key role in managing Circle’s USDC reserves through the Circle Reserve Fund, which holds about 90% of the stablecoin’s backing assets. However, a stake in Circle would expose the asset manager to the broader stablecoin market and expand its interest in the crypto scene beyond ETFs. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

Title: Circle Eyes $7.2B Valuation in Upsized U.S. IPO Amid Strong Investor Demand

Circle, the issuer of the USDC stablecoin, is aiming for a fully diluted valuation of up to $7.2 billion in its upcoming initial public offering, according to a Monday filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The company now plans to offer up to 32 million shares priced between $27 and $28 each, up from 24 million shares at $24 to $26 when it first filed in May. The move suggests investor interest in Circle’s business is growing, and possibly heating up faster than expected. That interest appears to be coming from some of the world’s most influential investors. In May, it was reported that BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, is considering purchasing up to 10% of Circle’s IPO shares, according to people familiar with the matter. Ark Invest, the investment firm led by Cathie Wood, has also signaled intent to buy $150 million worth of stock. Circle’s IPO comes as stablecoins are having a moment in the broader crypto market. Once considered niche instruments mostly used for crypto trading, they are now widely integrated into decentralized finance (DeFi), remittances and even traditional finance rails. The total market cap of all stablecoins now stands at $248 billion, with Tether’s USDT making up 62% of the market at $154 billion, followed by Circle’s USDC at $60 billion, according to DeFiLlama.

How companies are responding to US policy changes and what they should do instead How companies are responding to US policy changes and what they should do instead By Amanda Williams, Lucrezia Nava & Gail Whiteman Jun. 2, 2025 In President Trump’s second term, a variety of executive actions have reversed social progress. Withdrawing from the Paris Climate Agreement presents a significant challenge to bending the global emissions curve since it is one of the world’s largest greenhouse gas (GHG) emitters, but a variety of other actions will endanger the energy transition. Trump’s newly established National Energy Dominance Council will prioritize domestic oil and gas production, and reversing offshore drilling bans risks ecosystem degradation and increased emissions. Trump revoked Biden’s plan for 50 percent of all new vehicles sold in the United States to be electric by 2030, halting the distribution of funds from a $5 billion program to install vehicle charging stations. The head of the EPA has asked the White House to “repeal the ‘endangerment finding,’ which says that greenhouse gases pose a threat to public health and welfare,” contradicting climate science. Reversing the federal ban on plastic straws may seem minor, but 400 million tons of plastic waste is produced each year, harming marine ecosystems and human health. Meanwhile, Trump’s executive order dismantling diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives within the federal government eliminates DEI considerations in federal hiring, promotions, and performance reviews, aiming to prioritize merit-based decisions. According to the latest Sustainable Development Report, only 16 percent of the targets are on track to be met by 2030. For poverty and climate action, none of the targets are on track. How should companies respond this catastrophic backsliding? Management teams have a range of strategic responses available; they can exit or hide, and they can fight or foster. Backsliding is not a new phenomenon that emerged with the second Trump administration. Companies should learn from the past, and think long term: In other periods of backsliding, leaders were separated from greenwashers. The COVID pandemic was also a period of backsliding, during which many SDG indicators were reversed, numerous people were pushed into extreme poverty, and gender inequality was exacerbated. Some CEOs took pay cuts to cover employee salaries while others took hefty bonuses before filing for bankruptcy. Despite the pandemic-driven setbacks, many companies increased their climate ambitions, and the murder of George Floyd raised awareness and commitment to racial injustice. This period of backsliding will demonstrate which funds are really committed to responsible investing, and investments will shift to those funds that remain responsible. In eras of sustainability backsliding, it is quickly becoming evident who the real leaders are—they uphold or even increase their commitments when the going gets tough. Are you enjoying this article? Read more like this, plus SSIR's full archive of content, when you subscribe. Exit. Many companies are leaving industry alliances or retiring corporate sustainability goals and programs. Wells Fargo, Bank of America, and Morgan Stanley have already exited the Net Zero Banking Alliance, citing political pressure and legal concerns; BP and HSBC have scaled back their net-zero targets, reflecting a broader trend of corporations diluting their sustainability goals in response to shifting political and economic landscapes. Walmart, John Deere, and Ford have scaled back or censored formal diversity targets, programs, and initiatives in response to conservative activists. Meta is also retiring some DEI practices and CEO Mark Zuckerberg has argued that Meta, and other corporations, need “more masculine energy.” Asset management giants BlackRock and Vanguard have paused their support for environmental, social, and governance (ESG) proposals. In some cases, this approach may reveal that the earlier strategy of greenwashing no longer needs to be maintained. In other cases, companies are buying time to fully evaluate and assess the changes. But while companies that are abandoning sustainability activities may ward off short-term risks related to the immediate policy sphere, they face reputational and economic risks in the same short term: Consumers and activist groups, for example, held a week-long boycott aimed at Walmart. Hide. Some companies are strategically changing, hiding, or rebranding prior sustainability commitments to reduce risk. Costco, for example, is standing by its DEI practices but has rebranded them as a “People and Communities” program (even while seeing an increase in customers, presumably in appreciation for upholding its commitments). JP Morgan and Citigroup have left the Net-Zero Banking Alliance, but have stated that they plan to work independently on the path to net-zero. Opting for a lower-profile approach, scaling back public commitments, or, for example, omitting DEI-related reporting indicates a new strategy for communicating about sustainability: While maintaining internal sustainability efforts remains a priority, external positioning becomes more calculated. Hiding could still put companies at short-term risk. With companies facing lawsuits over DEI practices—as evidenced by Missouri’s case against Starbucks for breaching anti-discrimination laws—businesses that stand by their (hidden) DEI practices increase their vulnerability to changing laws and conservative scrutiny. Fight. Many companies are standing their ground and publicly reaffirming their existing sustainability commitments. For some, maintaining sustainability is a strategic imperative that cannot be quickly abandoned or hidden. For Ikea, whose CEO reaffirmed the company’s commitment to the Paris Agreement, sustainability is fully integrated into Ikea’s business model and core to its brand proposition. Moody’s rating agency and financial services company continues to leverage diverse teams to enhance the accuracy of its evaluations and decision-making. (Research demonstrates that diverse teams drive innovation, improve prediction accuracy, and enhance overall decision quality). Some are emphasizing the long-term nature of sustainability issues, since social and environmental challenges will endure much longer than one president. Archer Daniels Midland (AMD), a United States multinational food and commodities trader, for example, declared it would stick with its climate goals and reaffirmed its commitment to taking the climate crisis seriously. Ismeal Roig, a member of ADM’s executive council, said, “Frankly if I look forward to 10 or 20 years and you look at what’s going on with climate change, I don’t think this is a thing that we can just shrug off and forget about.” The company has reduced its GHG emissions by 25 percent since 2019 and is committed to no deforestation and to implementing regenerative agriculture practices. Andrew Forrest, an Australian mining billionaire, also confirmed a long-term commitment to net zero because it is “completely bankable.” He believes that short-term policy changes that scrap tax incentives for renewable energy will not change the long-term drive toward clean energy. Companies can use arguments about long-term strategic foresight and proactive risk management to ward off the short-term noise created by the changing political situation in the United States. In the short term, sustainability might be more expensive following Trump’s policies, but in the long term, maintaining those commitments makes strategic sense, especially in industries with long-lasting infrastructure lock-ins. Renewables have become increasingly competitive with fossil fuels as the cost of photovoltaic panels has dropped. These figures might change given President Trump’s exhortation to “drill, baby, drill,” but he cannot reverse the technological improvements that have been made in renewable energy or the long-term dynamics toward an increasingly warming planet and the associated consequences. A few corporate leaders have, therefore, openly stated that now is not the time to be absorbed by backsliding driven by the Trump administration, but to lead the sustainability transition more ambitiously than ever. André Hoffmann, Vice Chair of Roche, in the SDG Tent at the World Economic Forum in Davos reminded leaders not to be distracted by the short-term noise but to stick with their long-term sustainability vision: “I am sure that the economy will become more sustainable going forward because it is absolutely needed.” Foster. It remains to be seen if and how companies can turn Trump-driven backsliding into an opportunity to redefine and accelerate sustainability. Some corporate leaders are not just holding their ground but actively doubling down, investing more, innovating, and expanding sustainability efforts beyond their existing efforts. Although fossil fuels are becoming cheaper, companies can make even stronger climate commitments to transition to cleaner energy sources. Companies can invest now in infrastructure and other plans to secure a net-zeroU future. In March, Jesper Brodin posted on LinkedIn, “We’re investing €1.5 billion to accelerate the phase-out of fossil fuels through retrofitting our stores with renewable heating and cooling systems.” Ørsted, one of the world’s largest renewable energy firms, is increasing investments in offshore wind even as the United States shifts policy priorities. Companies are also repositioning their efforts to private-sector agreements. Companies like Verizon are bypassing government policy shifts by securing private-sector power purchase agreements to continue expanding renewable energy adoption. Private-sector coalitions focused on voluntary carbon markets and cross-industry partnerships are gaining traction, proving that sustainability leadership does not require government approval—it requires commitment and strategy. Other companies are focusing their growth on international markets. Tesla, for instance, has signed a lease agreement to open its first showroom in Mumbai, reinforcing its presence in Asia to help sustain the global electric vehicle transition. In the long run, Trump’s policies are unlikely to prevent the electric vehicle transition in the United States (it may just take longer). Companies can use the moment to rethink DEI approaches beyond policies and quotas to embed it in everyday practices. Managers can conduct a detailed review of hiring, evaluation, and promotion processes for unconscious biases and develop new approaches to foster a fairer and more inclusive workplace. Companies that surpass backsliding to foster sustainability innovation, rather than retreating, will emerge as the new industry leaders, shaping the next era of long-term value creation.

Title: Meta Shareholders Reject Bitcoin Treasury Proposal: Details

Photo Credit: Reuters As of September 30, 2024, Meta has $256 billion in total assets Meta recently assessed if a portion of its cash holdings could be invested into Bitcoin — the oldest and most expensive cryptocurrency in the world. Despite US President Donald Trump's pro-cryptocurrency stance, Meta shareholders dismissed the idea at the company's annual shareholders' meeting on May 28. Among a host of proposals and plans, the shareholders voted against a proposal for Bitcoin treasury assessment. In its proxy statement mailed to the shareholders before the meeting, Meta revealed that Bitcoin was not being included in the company's balance sheets. At the meeting, Meta shareholders voted on a total of 14 proposals, including the one for Bitcoin treasury assessment. The shareholders voted through stocks held as of the close of business on April 1, 2025. For the proposal regarding Bitcoin treasury assessment, an overwhelming 4,980,828,562 votes were registered against the plan as opposed to just 3,916,871 votes for it, which means a mere 0.078 percent of votes were registered in favour of the proposal, an SEC filing showed. Over eight million votes were registered as abstained. “The shareholders did not approve the shareholder proposal regarding Bitcoin treasury assessment,” the voting conclusion to the proposal read. In January, a Meta shareholder named Ethan Peck submitted a proposal to the company suggesting the possibility of exploring Bitcoin as part of the company's balance sheets. Titled "Bitcoin Treasury Assessment", Peck's proposal said Meta should consider replacing some percentage of its total assets into those that "appreciate more than bonds". "As of September 30, 2024, Meta has $256 billion (roughly Rs. 21,85,780 crore) in total assets, $72 billion (roughly Rs. 6,14,680 crore) of which is cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Since cash is consistently being debased and bond yields are lower than the true inflation rate, 28 percent of Meta's total assets are consistently diminishing shareholder value simply by sitting on the balance sheet," the proposal said. Peck said Meta should consider replacing some percentage of its assets with assets that “appreciate more than bonds, even if those assets are more volatile short-term". “Meta's second largest institutional shareholder, BlackRock, advised that a two percent Bitcoin allocation is reasonable,” Peck said in the proposal, adding that corporate and institutional Bitcoin adoption was increasingly becoming “commonplace”. Citing Bitcoin's price appreciation over the years and the trend of BTC investments catching pace in companies like MicroStrategy, Peck suggested that Meta should evaluate the benefits of exchanging some percentage of its cash holdings into BTC. A #Bitcoin Treasury Shareholder Proposal has been submitted to Meta.The shareholder, Ethan Peck, who is an employee at The National Center for Public Policy Research - the organization that submitted to $MSFT & $AMZN - informed me he submitted on behalf of his family's shares. pic.twitter.com/KrAKw7nHwp At the time, Bitcoin was trading at around $108,000 (roughly Rs. 92.2 lakh). Its price on June 2 stands at $104,948 (roughly Rs. 89.6 lakh). The volatility of Bitcoin emerged as a matter of concern for Meta, its proxy statement filed with the SEC revealed. The Meta board said the requested Bitcoin treasury assessment was “unnecessary”. “Meta utilizes a thorough decision-making process that considers many types of investable assets,” the board said in response. “Our audit & risk oversight committee provides oversight over Meta's treasury policies, and our primary goals are to preserve capital and provide liquidity to the company. “To support our ongoing operations, working capital, and capital expenditure needs, management comprehensively reviews a wide and diverse range of investable assets, including those that offer diversification and risk mitigation, on an ongoing basis. “As part of this process, we assess the volatility of potential assets and seek to invest in those which provide a balanced mix of stability and long-term return to support our financial sustainability. “While we are not opining on the merits of cryptocurrency investments compared to other assets, we believe the requested assessment is unnecessary given our existing processes to manage our corporate treasury.” Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who holds 61 percent voting power at Meta and is a vocal supporter of Web3 technologies like the metaverse, has not commented on the development yet. In October 2024, Microsoft, too, invited feedback from its shareholders on exploring Bitcoin investments. Later in December, however, shareholders of the software firm voted against the proposal, pointing out the asset's volatility.

Title: Bitcoin hits NYE 2000 on internet adoption timeline, but Snapchat has more users

Crypto ≠ mainstream (Yet): Why the $100K hype masks a massive adoption gap. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. “We’re not early anymore.” That is the mantra echoing across Crypto Twitter today. Last week, 35,000 people attended Bitcoin 2025, including Bitcoin enthusiasts, U.S. senators, White House staff, BlackRock analysts, and even once-imprisoned Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht. The spot price is well above $100,000, and Bitcoiners are celebrating ‘going mainstream.’ But behind the standing ovations and ETF-fueled price charts lies a quieter truth: Bitcoin is still far from mainstream. Despite a record-setting rally and Wall Street’s growing embrace, only 4 percent of the global population holds any Bitcoin at all. In raw numbers, that’s about 337 million people, half as many as Snapchat users. Even if you include altcoins, we’re still a few hundred million short at 659 million. For all its trillion-dollar promise, Bitcoin remains a fringe tool in a still-developing ecosystem. Compare Bitcoin’s adoption curve to that of the early Internet: Bitcoin in 2025 resembles the Internet before email went fully mainstream. It is a place of innovation, but far from ubiquitous. Using your Bitcoin wallet and reading articles like this one is akin to owning an AOL account or installing the latest version of Netscape from a CD attached to a computer magazine. At 4% adoption, we’re aligned with New Year’s Eve 2000. A time when the world was terrified of leaving their PC on as the clocks struck twelve, save the Millennium Bug would destroy humanity. Nokia 3210s filled the streets and classrooms, basic images loaded line by line, downloading an album took all day, and searches were performed by an online butler named Jeeves. A lot has changed with the Internet since then, and a lot still needs to change with Bitcoin integration if we are to continue to chart the same path. Some in the Las Vegas crowd may feel like the latecomers. Statistically, they’re still early adopters. The crypto narrative increasingly hinges on institutional participation. Since the SEC’s ETF approvals in early 2024, over $44 billion has poured into U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs. Pension funds, asset managers, and family offices have all allocated bitcoin as a portfolio hedge. Yet Bitcoin’s everyday utility hasn’t budged. Daily active addresses have dropped to near 700,000, after hitting a peak of 1.1 million in 2021. While TradFi money has legitimized BTC as an asset class, it has not translated into broader transactional use. Ross Ulbricht’s presence, celebrated for Bitcoin’s rebel roots, juxtaposed the contrast between Bitcoin as a political tool and as an institutional commodity. Despite its growing visibility, Bitcoin faces major obstacles on the road to mass adoption: Several initiatives are laying the groundwork for broader utility: “Bitcoin is no longer niche,” said WisdomTree analyst Dovile Silenskyte in January. That may be true in capital markets, but it’s not yet reflected in how people use money. At over $100,000 per BTC, the price of one coin now surpasses the average American household’s net worth (excluding home equity). As Bitcoin becomes more collectible, it risks becoming less usable, unless layer-two solutions and broader access reverse that trajectory. To convert hype into actual financial inclusion, Bitcoin advocates should recalibrate around: Bitcoin’s breakout moment may have arrived in headlines and hedge funds, but the true test lies ahead. Just as the Internet’s promise in the 1990s didn’t materialize until the 2000s brought mobile phones, broadband, and user-friendly apps, Bitcoin’s global impact will depend on what comes after the hype. Total wallets continue to rise, but Lightning usage, active wallets, and daily on-chain traders have failed to regain their all-time highs. The price is elevated, but on-chain usage is not. We cannot be complacent and claim victory when the battle is far from won. So, party like it’s 1999 and celebrate $100k Bitcoin. But, it took smartphones, particularly the iPhone, for internet adoption to maintain its momentum. What equivalent innovation is happening in Bitcoin? The Las Vegas summit was a celebration. But the revolution, in payments, savings, remittances, and financial sovereignty, won’t be televised. It’ll be built. Quietly. Brick by brick.

VivoPower, a sustainable energy Nasdaq-listed company, has said it plans to buy $121 million worth of XRP, raising the funds via a private share placement, and sending its stock sharply higher. The fundraising is being led by Saudi price Abdulaziz bin Turki Abdulaziz Al Saud, investing $100 million, with former SBI Ripple Asia executive Adam Traidman joining VivoPower as chairman of the board. “We have been investors in the digital asset sector for a decade and have been long-term holders of XRP,” prince Abdulaziz bin Turki Abdulaziz Al Saud, who met with Trump on his Saudi visit last month, said in a press release, adding the VivoPower investment is due to its "strategic focus on XRP and its objective to contribute to building out of the XRPL [XRP Ledger’] ecosystem." VivoPower said it will use the funds to buy XRP and establish its XRP-focused treasury operations, as well as invest in the XRPL decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. “VivoPower’s initiative to become the first publicly listed company with an XRP-centric treasury strategy is a forward-thinking move that reflects growing institutional conviction in real-world blockchain applications,” Traidman, a former Ripple board member, said in the press release.

More cryptocurrencies to corporate treasuries gets underway. The trend for companies to add bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to their corporate treasuries was started by Michael Saylor’s Strategy in 2020, with Strategy’s near-3,000% stock rally inspiring a flood of copy cat trades. Last week, GameStop became the latest company to begin buying bitcoin, while rival cryptocurrencies ethereum and solana have also been adopted by companies as treasury assets. The XRP price rally was boosted earlier this year when U.S. president Trump named XRP as one of a handful of cryptocurrencies that the U.S. would add to its so-called crypto stockpile, giving a level of validation to the cryptocurrency asset class that was almost unimaginable before Trump’s November election victory.

The iShares Core S&P Total U.S. Stock Market Index ETF (XTOT) will provide investors with broad-based exposure to the total U.S. equity market, covering large-, mid-, small-, and micro-capitalized companies. The iShares Core S&P Total U.S. Stock Market Index ETF will also be available in a U.S.-dollar denominated class (XTOT.U). “We are pleased to expand our suite of low-cost, diversified core ETFs with the addition of the iShares Core S&P Total U.S. Stock Market Index ETF. This new ETF offers investors a convenient way to access broad-based exposure to the total U.S. equity market, making investing in global markets easier and more affordable for Canadians,” said Steven Leong, Head of Product at BlackRock Canada. The iShares Core Canadian Short-Mid Term Universe Bond Index ETF (XSMB) will provide investors with exposure to a broadly diversified range of Canadian domiciled bonds with maturities between 1 and 10 years, which may include any or all of federal, provincial, corporate (including certain qualifying asset-backed securities) and municipal bonds. “Canadians continue to embrace fixed income ETFs as efficient tools for building resilient, well-diversified portfolios.

Title: Palantir goes domestic, and Big Brother is officially here

There’s a quote, though the source isn’t exactly known, and it goes like this: “Whenever people need a hero, we shall supply him.” I can’t quite shake the feeling that Donald Trump is that controlled opposition hero, and this story has me all the more unsettled: Trump is reportedly funneling hundreds of millions of dollars to software giant Palantir, building out a massive domestic surveillance and data collection network, which includes American citizens. From a report at Yahoo Finance: Since Trump signed an executive order in March calling for more interagency data sharing, Palantir has quietly become the go-to vendor for building that digital infrastructure. The company has landed more than $113 million in new and extended federal contracts since Trump took office including a blockbuster $795 million deal with the Pentagon last week. Palantir's Foundry platform is already in use at Homeland Security and Health and Human Services, and engineers were recently embedded at the IRS to begin building a unified, searchable database for taxpayer records. Talks are also underway with the Social Security Administration and Department of Education, suggesting more agencies could follow. To make matters worse, a slew of MAGA sycophants are promising critical thinkers that this is a “good thing” for Americans, because it’s how we identify all of the threats that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris imported into the country during their reign of terror—one such example is seen below: If you’re a patriot, you want Trump using every tool to keep you safe. — Pregnant Redhead (@PregnantRedhead) May 30, 2025 Perhaps she never heard the wise remark attributed to Benjamin Franklin: “Those who would trade freedom for safety deserve neither liberty nor safety.” To follow Franklin’s observation to its logical conclusion: “Those who would trade freedom for safety will get neither liberty nor safety. The Republican federal government is selling us this massive database by saying it’s how we clean up the illegal invasion mess wrought by the Democrats—but something tells me they were in it together, and this was the plan all along. We’d resist a centralized database under the Democrats, but when Trump does it? “It’s for our safety.” (More dangerous words have never been spoken by politicians.) A summary of the situation, from Jason Bassler of The Free Thought Project: Trump loyalists drowning in copium. Remember, rule #1 is ALWAYS: Never get high on your own supply. pic.twitter.com/kppLyi9wc3 — Jason Bassler (@JasonBassler1) June 1, 2025 Now, Palantir isn’t exactly to be trusted, for a number of reasons. First of all, the company was founded in part by a man named Peter Thiel, with investment firms BlackRock and Vanguard owning a significant share. Thiel is a billionaire member of the World Economic Forum, and in 2023, Thiel’s gay lover was found dead after he reportedly blew the lid on the alleged affair to Thiel’s husband. He doesn’t quite strike me as a “conservative,” or an America-first type of guy. Here’s another disturbing aspect: the name “Palantir” comes from J. R. R. Tolkien’s Lord of the Rings tale, as it was the name of the indestructible crystal ball that the evil Saruman used to surveil events throughout Middle Earth, even those far into the future. With Palantir’s use of AI to run algorithms and assess future threats, this is looking a little like the plot to Minority Report. UPDATED: I have just come across a relevant video. Below, Alex Karp, another Palantir founder, brags about how his tech “stopped the far-right” movement that was washing across Europe: MUST WATCH: Alex Karp, the co-founder & CEO of Peter Thiel’s company Palantir, says that their product known as Gotham (which he calls PG) “single handedly stopped the rise of the far right in Europe”. Peter Thiel calls himself an ally to the right while he works to destroy us. pic.twitter.com/FVjT8D9qv1 — Laura Loomer (@LauraLoomer) January 18, 2023 Now, Bassler also adds this about the new data centralization plans: No, this Palantir database isn’t like the others. It will combine: -Tax filings -Student debt -Social Security -Bank accounts -Medical claims -Immigration status No previous database system has ever centralized this much personal info across various federal agencies. — Jason Bassler (@JasonBassler1) June 1, 2025 And, where it can lead: -REAL ID enforcement -Surveillance stablecoins -AI Biometric entry/exit systems -Palantir building a master database -FedEx trucks equipped with license plate readers -ICE using facial recognition to monitor online dissent 2025: Directed by Orwell, produced by Palantir. — Jason Bassler (@JasonBassler1) June 2, 2025 Big Brother is officially here.
