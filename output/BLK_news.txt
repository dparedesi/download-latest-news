Title: Panama President Mulino says Trump ‘lying’ about reclaiming the canal

Panamanian leader says sale of a Chinese company’s port operation to a US firm does not amount to retaking the waterway. Panama President Jose Raul Mulino has accused his American counterpart, Donald Trump, of lying when he told members of Congress that the United States is “reclaiming” the Panama Canal. In a statement posted on X on Wednesday, Mulino said the man-made waterway that connects the Atlantic and Pacific oceans “is not in the process of recovery” by Trump and the US government. “Once again, President Trump is lying,” Mulino wrote on X. “I reject, on behalf of Panama and all Panamanians, this new affront to the truth and to our dignity as a nation,” Mulino added. During the annual presidential address to the US Congress on Tuesday, Trump declared that Washington would be reclaiming the Panama Canal “to further enhance” US national security. “We’ve already started doing it. We’re taking it back.” He was referencing a deal announced on Tuesday for a consortium, led by the US investment management company BlackRock Inc, to buy a controlling stake in the company held by a Chinese group that operates ports at both ends of one of the busiest water channels in the world. In a filing, CK Hutchison Holding had announced that it would sell all shares in Hutchison Port Holdings and in Hutchison Port Group Holdings to BlackRock in a deal valued at nearly $23bn, including $5bn in debt. The deal has to be approved by Panama’s government. Trump has been talking about retaking the Panama Canal since his campaign, arguing the US should have never turned control over to the Panamanians and that the US was being overcharged for using it. Since returning to the White House, he has also started complaining that China controls the canal, and did not rule out a military invasion to regain control of it. Panama maintains it has full control over the canal and that the Hong Kong-based group’s operation of the ports did not amount to Chinese control over the waterway, and therefore the private sale to a US-based company would not represent any US “reclaiming” of the canal. In February, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio met with Mulino and insisted that China was exerting influence over the canal’s operations. Panama rejected that China had any influence over canal operations. Beijing has also consistently denied interfering in the canal. The US built the canal in the early 1900s as it looked for ways to facilitate the transit of commercial and military vessels between its coasts. Washington relinquished control of the waterway to Panama on December 31, 1999, under a treaty signed in 1977 by President Jimmy Carter. Trump has claimed that Carter “foolishly” gave the canal away. The 80km (50-mile) canal handles 5 percent of global maritime trade and 40 percent of US container traffic. Follow Al Jazeera English:

Title: Brevan Howard's pitch to deep-pocketed investors: The 'true risk' of crypto is not having exposure
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/brevan-howard-digital-assets-crypto-investing-investor-pitch-aron-landy-2025-3
Time Published: 2025-03-06T10:03:01Z
Full Content:
Aron Landy — the CEO of $34 billion macro investment manager Brevan Howard — believes the "tipping point" that will lead institutional investors to pile into crypto is on the horizon. Years of volatility and big-name bad actors have kept institutions away from digital assets. Still, with a new administration in the US and asset managers like BlackRock and Fidelity becoming more entrenched in the space, the world's biggest investors will slowly wade into the space — and then dive fully in. London-based Brevan Howard, through its $2.5 billion stand-alone crypto unit that was up over 52% last year, is aiming to be the place to go for crypto-curious institutions. "The predominant mindset in the institutional space has been that any exposure to digital assets is a little too volatile," Landy told Business Insider. "I believe that a shift in mindset is happening and that soon, even this year, having zero exposure to digital assets will be the true risk." "At the moment, it's kind of a separate asset class, but over time, there'll be a convergence," he added. That convergence may be sped up by President Donald Trump's administration. After years of frustration under former President Joe Biden's SEC commissioner Gary Gensler, President Donald Trump, and his crypto czar David Sacks have provided a jolt to the space. While some have been frustrated with the administration's crypto agenda, including the creation of meme coins related to Trump and the first lady, Melania Trump, and the strategic reserve of different digital assets, the election was a positive change for the industry, said Gautam Sharma, the CEO and chief investment officer of Brevan Howard Digital. Sharma declined to provide additional comment on the creation of the reserve. The size of the talent pool and the amount of capital in the US means the "vibe" around an industry can matter just as much as a specific policy, Sharma said. Brevan thinks of the industry as a "transformational technology" akin to the internet, Landy said, and "any new innovation needs two things: talent and capital," Sharma said. The two executives said there should be plenty of momentum to attract ambitious young people to the industry. "The digital asset universe has tailwinds, not headwinds," Landy said. September will be the unit's fourth anniversary, and Sharma told BI that the goal remains the same as when they launched in 2021. "Our objective is to be the leading asset manager for institutional investors in digital assets," he said, noting that the manager is working on a few additional products for institutional investors to add alongside its flagship multi-manager crypto fund. As the digital asset space becomes more integrated into financial institutions and accepted by regulators, big-name asset managers will follow suit. Former crypto critics, like Citadel Securities' Ken Griffin, are embracing the space and building out their offerings because of the tailwinds. Among alternative investors, especially those catering to large institutional investors like sovereign wealth and pension funds, Brevan has a relative headstart thanks partly to its founder, billionaire Alan Howard. Howard has been interested in the space for close to a decade and started investing his personal capital in 2016 and has seen firsthand how the industry has changed, Sharma said. "Alan understands this space better than most, not just the investing side of it but the systems," said Sharma, who previously ran internal projects for the hedge fund and oversaw the buildout of the digital assets business alongside Natalie Smith, the firm's head of strategy and client partnership group. Howard's enthusiasm led Brevan Howard Digital to focus not just on hiring investing staff, technologists, and engineers. The firm built the unit's infrastructure from scratch over six months in 2021 and now has a team of more than 60 people in eight offices that can trade around the clock. A person close to Brevan said the firm's digital asset investment products have "relatively long lock-up periods" to help the firm withstand volatility. It aligns with the firm's belief that small bumps in the road will be just that: bumps in the road. The digital asset industry "could be worth many multiples than what it is now," Landy said, and the firm wants to partner with institutions willing to back that long-term vision. The separate digital-asset unit invests in liquid coins such as Bitcoin but also options, derivatives, and private stakes in startups. Brevan Howard Digital also helps diversity the firm's largest multistrategy funds, managing sleeves of capital for the $12 billion master fund. "The reason to invest is not because it's going up, or that it's gone down and therefore cheap," but instead to be exposed to something transformational for all industries, Landy said. The firm's conviction in the industry comes not just from Howard's personal interest, but the many engineers and technologists inside the firm who have been passionate about the space for years, he said. "From a macro investing perspective, investors should have some exposure to it," he said, and the firm is ready for the "tipping point" that will lead to institutions flooding in. "Having some exposure will be the norm," Landy said, and those who choose Brevan "invest with us because they want our expertise." Jump to

Title: Proxy Adviser Glass Lewis Sticks With Diversity Guidance, Will Flag Risks

Proxy adviser Glass Lewis will continue to consider boardroom diversity when advising how to vote at U.S. company annual meetings, but plans to be clearer about the counter argument for critical vote recommendations to help clients avoid rising political risks. The change comes amid a wave of retreat by U.S. corporations from their diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) efforts, under threat of legal action by U.S. President Donald Trump’s Justice Department. The decision by Glass Lewis to remain largely committed to diversity follows a review of its policies and after proxy advisor rival Institutional Shareholder Services last month said it would no longer consider diversity when making its boardroom recommendations. In an e-mail to clients seen by Reuters, Glass Lewis said it will stand by its 2025 benchmark guidelines for U.S. companies, which include that shareholders vote against certain directors at some of the largest U.S. companies whose boards lack gender, racial or LGBTQ diversity. But when it recommends votes against a director in any way related to diversity, Glass Lewis said it will also flag information that could support an alternative vote by the client. “This approach allows Glass Lewis to deliver the vote recommendations expected by clients while also clearly flagging the potential risk that may result from an AGAINST vote decision and providing a clear path should some clients choose to vote FOR the proposal,” the firm said. A Glass Lewis spokeswoman said it also will likely include more context when making recommendations on diversity-related shareholder proposals. Glass Lewis and ISS dominate the U.S. market for selling recommendations about how investors should vote at corporate meetings on matters such as boardroom elections or executive pay. Glass Lewis counts some 1,300 clients globally including top pension plans, mutual funds and asset managers with more than $40 trillion in collective assets. Their policies are widely used by investors including mutual funds and pension plans which may not have the resources to do due diligence on every company in their portfolio. “Certainly, we would have preferred not to have had to deliberate over long-standing policy guidelines on board diversity and DEI shareholder proposals, but the U.S. Administration’s opposition to DEI is compelling companies, institutional investors and their proxy advisors to consider changes, now or in the future,” Glass Lewis’ note said. The move echoes steps taken by major asset managers including BlackRock BLK.N and Vanguard, which faced pressure over their voting decisions and in response looked to give clients more control.

Title: Panama President Issues Defiant Response To Trump Over 'Reclaiming' Canal Line

PANAMA CITY (AP) — Panama President José Raúl Mulino on Wednesday accused U.S. President Donald Trump of lying when he said in his address to Congress that his administration was “reclaiming” the Panama Canal. Trump was referencing a deal announced Tuesday for a consortium led by the U.S. investment management company BlackRock Inc. to buy a controlling stake in the company held by a Chinese group that operates ports at both ends of the Panama Canal. Panama maintains that it has full control over the canal and that the Hong Kong-based group’s operation of the ports did not amount to Chinese control over the waterway, and that therefore the sale to a U.S.-based company would not represent any U.S. “reclaiming” of the canal. Panama’s government on Tuesday called the sale a private transaction. Mulino in a message posted to X on Wednesday, rejected that the deal came about because of U.S. pressure. “I reject in the name of Panama and all Panamanians this new affront to the truth and our dignity as a nation,” he wrote. He accused Trump of “lying again.” Trump has talked about retaking the Panama Canal since his campaign, arguing that the U.S. should have never turned control over to the Panamanians and that the U.S. was being overcharged for using it. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio met with Mulino in early February and insisted that China was exerting influence over the canal’s operations. The focus was the Chinese consortium running the ports. Panama rejected that China had any influence over canal operations. “Cooperation between our governments passes through clear understandings in terms of issues of mutual interest,” Mulino wrote. “It doesn’t have anything to do with ‘reclaiming the canal’ nor with tarnishing our national sovereignty.” In a filing, CK Hutchison Holding said Tuesday that it would sell all shares in Hutchison Port Holdings and in Hutchison Port Group Holdings to the BlackRock consortium in a deal valued at nearly $23 billion, including $5 billion in debt. The deal has to be approved by Panama’s government. The United States built the canal in the early 1900s as it looked for ways to facilitate the transit of commercial and military vessels between its coasts. Washington relinquished control of the waterway to Panama on Dec. 31, 1999, under a treaty signed in 1977 by President Jimmy Carter. Trump has claimed that Carter “foolishly” gave the canal away. Frank Sixt, co-managing director of CK Hutchison, said in a statement that the transaction was “the result of a rapid, discrete but competitive process in which numerous bids and expressions of interest were received.” The next four years will change America forever.

Title: How has ‘public squalor’ become so normalised in our towns and cities?

Housing vacancy is again making headlines. Figures from GeoDirectory, which is a joint venture between Tailte Éireann and An Post, estimates the housing vacancy rate at 3.8 per cent or 81,449 houses. Census 2022 by the CSO calculated Ireland’s housing vacancy at more than 163,000 houses, or 7.7 per cent. Forty-eight thousand houses were vacant for more than five years and, again according to GeoDirectory, an additional 20,092 were derelict. We need some degree of vacancy to align sellers and buyers, and based on GeoDirectory figures we do not have a housing vacancy problem. A stroll through many of the State’s cities and towns, however, would suggest that this conclusion is perhaps optimistic. (Questions to GeoDirectory about the difference between its figures and CSO calculations went unanswered.) Last year architects Frank O’Connor and Jude Sherry recorded 700 empty properties within two kilometres of Cork city centre, about 70 per cent of which was housing. At the same time, there are 2,893 households on the Cork City social housing waiting list, or just 300 houses for sale if that is your preferred metric. “Dereliction eats away the urban fabric [and] wastes vital resources, makes areas look ugly and feel unsafe. So why has it been normalised and enabled by the State?” O’Connor asks. It is a fair question. A cultural aversion to interfering with what people do with their properties or even asking owners what they are doing with them is part of the problem. An assumption that property rights are non-negotiable and take precedence over the common good has also led to a propensity for people doing what they want with their property or nothing at all. There are penalties on buildings that end up on a council’s Derelict Sites Register, but their application nationally is sclerotic. At the end of 2023, Dublin City Council was owed €6.8 million in unpaid derelict buildings fines. Councils are also culprits themselves: “Chances are, in Dublin, if it has buddleia growing on it, it’s owned by the local authority,” Ciarán Cuffe, the former councillor and MEP, recently told the Dublin Inquirer. [ Derelict Victorian houses ‘crumbling’ six years after €700,000 purchase by Dublin City CouncilOpens in new window ] A “vacancy relief” for commercial rates for those with unoccupied shops and offices, including those above the shop, is also questionable. In France, nearly 3,700 towns have introduced a tax of 17 per cent of the rental value of a property empty for more than one year, rising to 34 per cent in year two. Here, as this newspaper’s recent series on Derelict Dublin showed, important and run-of-the-mill buildings lie vacant for decades to the point of dereliction and we pay little heed and often no penalties. As with a lot of Irish regulation, laissez-faire enforcement is the norm, and it just doesn’t work. Vacant and derelict buildings stem from market, policy and ideological failure. The result is unpleasant environments, and towns and villages dying for the want of inhabitants, at the same time as multiple buildings sit empty. Sometimes for reasons of affordability, sometimes because the town isn’t attractive – and sometimes just because of their own notions of grandeur – people build new houses outside towns and drive everywhere. Both practices are unsustainable. Legislation, policy or technical solutions can only do so much – in the end it is about the State as much as it is about individuals Attempts to beautify towns and woo back inhabitants to by improving the urban experience with more public seating, pedestrian crossings and wider footpaths, for example, often run into sand for one reason: councillors don’t want any parking removed. Yet research shows three things: walking, cycling and public realm improvements can increase retail sales by 30 per cent; Irish retailers overestimate the proportion of their customers who arrive by car to do their shopping and underestimate those who walk; and people who walk to the shops go there more often. A good public realm is a good business realm. In towns where the public realm has been improved, footfall and business has increased. See Blackrock, Co Dublin, or Virginia, Co Cavan, or Clonakilty, Co Cork. Ireland’s market towns in particular, the Strokestowns and Templemores with their wide streets, have huge potential for attractive urban realms to entice new families and business. Ireland’s capital exhibits the characteristics of both a shanty town and a beautiful town. The difference between Dublin and comparable international cities is that these characteristics often exist side-by-side on the same street, including its main thoroughfare; what Jude Sherry calls “public squalor”. Dublin city had more than 18,000 vacant residential units in Census 2022, with more than 5,000 of these recorded as available “for rent” (there were 34,000 nationwide). A lot of these are illegal short-term lets – the Airbnb phenomenon is another example of letting people do what they want with their property at the expense of wider society. There is now a new Bill to regulate short-terms lets. Buildings aside, the most memorable feature of good cities is the public transport system. Despite being open since December 2017, neither Cabra nor Phibsboro Luas stops have any public street signage. Look at the beautiful bus and metro stations in European cities – with actual signage. We get bus stops on the side of roads with not even a seat or shelter from the rain. In 2017, Fianna Fáil’s Barry Cowen brought forward a good vacant house refurbishment Bill. More recently, the Greens had something similar, but it lapsed with the election. There are refurbishment grants available for vacant and derelict housing, but these are paid retrospectively, reducing their usefulness. There has been limited progress on easing the conversion of vacant above-the-shop units with some exceptions – Waterford City and County Council has been doing good work via the Repair and Lease Scheme. Dereliction and vacancy – and our tolerance for both – are symptoms of a bigger problem: the low value we put on place. Unfortunately, as with road safety, there seems to be only so much legislation, policy or technical solutions can do. In the end it is an issue of attitude – of the State as much as of individuals. For a country allegedly obsessed with property we care surprisingly little for it, apart from its financial value of course. The engraving on 19th century engineer Thomas Drummond’s plinth in Dublin City Hall reads: “Property has its duties as well as its rights.” It should be imprinted on the deeds of every building in the country.

Title: Trump lays out bold vision for America in first joint session of Congress

The address was met with a mix of fervent applause and predictable jeers from Democrats, who have become the embodiment of obstructionism and defeatism in the face of Trumpâs bold agenda. From reclaiming the Panama Canal to cracking down on illegal immigration and vowing to plant the American flag on Mars, Trumpâs speech was a clarion call for a stronger, prouder, and more self-reliant America. Reclaiming the Panama Canal and securing Greenland One of the most striking moments of the speech came when Trump announced his administrationâs efforts to âreclaim the Panama Canalâ for the United States. âThe Panama Canal was built by Americans for Americans, not for others,â Trump declared, referencing reports that U.S. investment firm BlackRock is set to purchase the canalâs port infrastructure from its current Chinese owner. Trumpâs remarks underscored his unwavering commitment to restoring American control over strategic assets that have been mismanaged or exploited by foreign powers. âWe didnât give it to China. We gave it to Panama, and weâre taking it back,â he said, drawing thunderous applause from his supporters. The president also reignited his push to secure Greenland, a move that has long been a point of contention with Denmark. âThe people of Greenland deserve the right to determine their future,â Trump said, suggesting that the island could break away from Denmark and join the United States. âWe need Greenland, and we will secure it one way or the other,â he added, signaling his determination to expand American influence in the Arctic region. Ending the Ukraine conflict and restoring American diplomacy Trump also addressed the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, reiterating his commitment to ending what he called a âsenselessâ war. He criticized Democratic leaders, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, for their apparent willingness to prolong the conflict. âSome people would rather see this war drag on for another five years,â Trump said, taking a swipe at Warren, whom he derisively referred to as âPocahontas.â The president highlighted his administrationâs efforts to broker peace between Ukraine and Russia, emphasizing that fostering normal diplomatic relations with Moscow serves American interests. Despite recent tensions with Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky, Trump announced that a minerals agreement between the U.S. and Ukraine was back on track, citing Zelenskyâs renewed commitment to peace and partnership. Cracking down on illegal immigration and ending wokism Domestically, Trump focused on his administrationâs achievements in border security and immigration enforcement. He invited several guests to Capitol Hill whose stories shine a light on the human cost of illegal immigration, including family members of crime victims targeted by undocumented immigrants and a Border Patrol agent injured in the line of duty. Trump also took aim at the cultural left, declaring an end to the âtyranny of so-called diversity, equity, and inclusion policies.â He called on Congress to criminalize âsex changes on children,â denouncing the idea that a child can be âtrapped in the wrong bodyâ as âa big lie.â His supporters cheered the move as a long-overdue measure to protect children from irreversible medical procedures. The president also defended his decision to reinstate the ban on transgender individuals serving in the military, stating, âOur soldiers wonât be activists and ideologues â they will be fighters and warriors.â Elon Musk, Mars, and the American spirit of innovation Trump reserved special praise for Elon Musk, whose leadership at the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has uncovered billions in government waste and fraud. âElon Musk is a true American pioneer,â Trump said, celebrating Muskâs efforts to dismantle the ârule by unelected bureaucrats.â Looking to the future, Trump vowed that his second term would yield historic accomplishments, including the colonization of Mars. âWe are going to lead humanity into space and plant the American flag on the planet Mars and even far beyond,â he declared, echoing Muskâs vision for interplanetary exploration. Trumpâs speech was a powerful reminder of the resilience and determination that have defined America throughout its history. From reclaiming strategic assets to ending cultural divisiveness and pushing the boundaries of human achievement, Trumpâs vision for America is one of strength, pride, and boundless possibility. As the nation moves forward under Trumpâs leadership, the contrast between his bold agenda and the petulant obstructionism of the Democrats could not be clearer. While the left clings to its dogma of division and decline, Trumpâs America is rising, stronger and more united than ever. The road ahead is long, but with courage, common sense, and an unwavering commitment to the American spirit, the best is yet to come.

The Wyoming-incorporated tech firm released its Ethereum Strategy Whitepaper alongside the announcement, detailing its rationale behind choosing Ethereum over the more commonly adopted Bitcoin for corporate treasury management. "While Bitcoin remains a strong store of value, Ethereum provides broader utility as a programmable financial platform," the firm wrote on its Whitepaper, published Wednesday. BioNexus touts Ethereum's yield-generation capabilities through staking as a key advantage over Bitcoin, despite the latter’s adoption by institutional investors last year. "Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum provides an additional revenue stream through staking. Ethereum's Proof-of-Stake mechanism allows holders to generate 3-5% annual yield," the firm said in its Whitepaper, adding it could potentially turn Ethereum "from a passive asset into an income-generating treasury instrument." BioNexus points to Ethereum's institutional credibility as another factor, noting Ethereum's adoption by major financial entities such as BlackRock and Fidelity validates "its long-term potential as a financial instrument." "Our goal is to strategically position Ethereum as a core component of our treasury over time," BioNexus CEO Sam Tan told Decrypt in an emailed statement. "I can confirm that our Board’s approval provides flexibility. We intend to allocate a meaningful portion of our reserves to Ethereum." Tan declined to disclose an exact percentage for its Ethereum allocation "at this stage," but said the company's team has been "preparing for this shift for some time." "We’re currently weighing whether to operate our own validator nodes or partner with established third-party staking providers," Tan said. "Our choice will hinge on security, efficiency, and compliance, and we’ll finalize this as we scale our Ethereum holdings." The company also cites Ethereum's role in the global financial system, claiming the network "underpins trillions in stablecoin transactions annually, acting as the settlement layer for USDT, USDC, and other stablecoins." BioNexus’ Ethereum Strategy Whitepaper specifically references the upcoming Pectra protocol upgrade, which it sees as something that could reinforce Ethereum's stature "as a dependable long-term infrastructure for businesses." Despite the optimism, Pectra’s update has faced issues in recent weeks including during its Sepolia test network run early Wednesday, following similar roadblocks from its earlier Holesky testing phase. BioNexus operates primarily in Asia through its Malaysian subsidiary, working in genomic diagnostics and chemical distribution. Its provision of industrial chemical supplies for the automotive and aerospace sectors accounts for 90% of its total revenue. It has also developed RNA-based blood tests for early detection of cancers and inflammatory diseases, a segment that represents 10% of its revenue. But for all its prospects with Ethereum, BioNexus appears to be battling financial challenges of its own. In December last year, the company received a Nasdaq notice for non-compliance with the minimum $1 bid price rule.A temporary exception was granted, giving it until May 1, 2025, to regain compliance. To address this, BioNexus plans a reverse stock split by April 7, 2025. The company reported $9.26 million in trailing twelve-month revenue, over a $5.88 million market cap, with its stock trading at $0.32, down 61% on the year, data from the Financial Times shows.

Essential news coupled with the finest maritime content sourced from across the globe. FILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump pumps his fist as he steps from Air Force One upon his arrival in West Palm Beach, Florida, U.S., February 28, 2025. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque/File Photo By Lisa Baertlein LOS ANGELES, March 5 (Reuters) – U.S. President Donald Trump is drafting an executive order aimed at resuscitating domestic shipbuilding and reducing China’s grip on the $150 billion global ocean shipping industry and countering its rising naval power. A draft fact sheet seen by Reuters on Wednesday includes an 18-point plan that includes funding the effort with fees from imports arriving on Chinese-made ships. It would also establish a Maritime Security Trust Fund as a dedicated funding source and create shipbuilding incentives that include tax credits, grants and loans. “The White House is standing up an office at the National Security Council to lead a whole-of-government effort to strengthen the maritime industrial base,” the document said, following Trump’s announcement of the plans during an address to Congress on Tuesday. Republican and Democratic U.S. lawmakers for years have warned about China’s growing dominance on the seas and diminishing U.S. naval readiness. The pending executive order appears to be influenced by existing proposals, including legislation with bipartisan backing. Trump’s initiative comes two months after the Biden administration concluded a nearly year-long probe requested by the United Steelworkers and other unions, which concluded that China uses unfair policies and practices to dominate the sector. Michael Wessel, president of the Wessel Group, who helped coordinate that investigation under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, called Trump’s announcement an encouraging step forward after years of efforts by unions to revitalize the industry. “We can still be the industrial leaders of the world – but only if we act,” he said. “Now is the time for Trump to turn words into action and follow through on his commitments.” Mike Waltz, Trump’s national security adviser and a former House Republican from Florida, last year introduced a bill with Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly from Arizona to reinvigorate commercial and military shipbuilding in the United States. The U.S. Trade Representative’s office last month proposed charging up to $1.5 million for Chinese-built vessels entering U.S. ports as part of its probe of China’s growing domination of the global shipbuilding, maritime and logistics sectors. Trump on Tuesday hailed an unrelated deal led by U.S. firm BlackRock to buy most of the $22.8 billion ports business of Hong Kong conglomerate CK Hutchison. The deal will give the U.S. consortium control of key Panama Canal ports amid White House calls to remove them from what it says is Chinese ownership. “My administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal, and we’ve already started doing it,” Trump told the U.S. Congress. That BlackRock announcement followed last month’s reintroduction of bipartisan legislation that would require the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense to develop a strategy to monitor China’s efforts to build, buy, or own strategic ports. Other measures in the draft document would direct Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency to review government procurement processes, including at the U.S. Navy; increase wages for nuclear shipyard workers; and develop a security strategy for the Arctic.

Title: Canary Capital Files to Launch ETF Tracking Cross-Chain Protocol Axelar (AXL)
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/03/04/canary-capital-files-to-launch-etf-tracking-cross-chain-protocol-axelar
Time Published: 2025-03-05T22:17:35Z
Full Content:
Canary Capital, the digital asset-focused investment firm founded by former Valkyrie Funds co-founder Steven McClurg, is planning on launching an exchange-traded fund (ETF) tracking the price of Axelar (AXL). The firm submitted an S-1 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Wednesday, kicking off the process to launch such a fund. The hedge fund has previously filed paperwork for several other ETFs. Some of these have already been acknowledged by the Commission and await approval. "Axelar has one of the best dev teams in blockchain. Most viable protocols work with them on chain interoperability," said Steven McClurg, Chief Executive Officer at Canary Capital. "There is no question that AXL will be a top 20 token by market capitalization as the market discovers them. This is why we took the risk." AXL is the native token of the Alexar Network, a cross-chain protocol that connects other blockchains, enabling decentralized, secure cross-chain transactions. Unlike many interoperability solutions that rely on a small set of validators, Axelar operates on a proof-of-stake consensus model, allowing anyone to participate in its network, Sergey Gorbunov, co-founder of Axelar protocol, said in an interview with CoinDesk. The protocol, which has previously been integrated by J.P. Morgan’s Kinexys platform, Microsoft’s Azure marketplace as well as Uniswap and MetaMask, also announced the appointment of former Coinbase chief legal officer and Acting Comptroller of the Currency Brian Brooks to its newly formed Institutional Advisory Board. “Brian comes with a pretty deep understanding of how do you actually make sure blockchain is adopted by traditional finance,” said Gorbunov. “He understands what pain points these asset issuers have and he believes that decentralized interoperability is very essential to not introduce all of those issues in the process.” According to Gorbunov, stablecoins and tokenization are poised to be the next major trends for institutions in crypto, driven by regulatory developments and efficiency gains. A stablecoin bill expected in the coming months could open the door for more financial institutions to issue and integrate stablecoins, with firms like PayPal, BlackRock, and Robinhood already exploring their use for settlement to reduce costs. AXL currently trades at $0.36 and stands at a market cap of $340 million, according to CoinDesk data. The token reached an all-time high in March 2024 at $2.69 but has since dropped.

Title: Greenland, Panama fiercely reject Trump’s ambitions in address to Congress

President Donald Trump says the U.S. needs Greenland for national and international security during a joint address to Congress. Leaders from both Greenland and Panama issued messages on Wednesday fervently rejecting the comments made by President Donald Trump during his address to Congress in which he again reiterated his ambitions to grab hold of the strategically important areas. Trump has made clear he intends to "acquire" both Greenland and the Panama Canal, and previously refused to rule out military intervention to achieve his expansionist goals. In his joint address to Congress, the president said his administration had already taken steps to "take back" the Panama Canal and reiterated his push to acquire Greenland, which is currently a territory of Denmark. TRUMP SAYS AMERICA WOULD WELCOME GREENLAND DURING JOINT ADDRESS TO CONGRESS President Donald Trump addresses a joint session of Congress at the Capitol in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday. (Win McNamee/Getty Images) Trump spoke directly to Greenland in his address on Tuesday night and said, "We strongly support your right to determine your own future, and if you choose, we welcome you into the United States of America." "We will keep you safe. We will make you rich. And together we will take Greenland to heights like you have never thought possible before," he added. Trump then said his administration was "working with everybody involved to try to get it." "We need it really for international world security. And I think we’re going to get it," he continued. "One way or the other, we’re going to get it." Greenland Prime Minister Múte Egede on Wednesday made clear he is neither interested in American nor Danish ownership. "We do not want to be Americans, nor Danes, we are Kalaallit (Greenlanders). The Americans and their leader must understand that," Egede said in a post on Facebook translated by Reuters. "We are not for sale and cannot be taken. Our future is determined by us in Greenland," he added. Greenland Prime Minister Múte Egede, left, and President Donald Trump. (Getty Images | Fox News Digital) Trump’s comments regarding the Panama Canal on Tuesday night were just as direct when he said, "My administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal." "We've already started doing it," he added. Trump has claimed China has taken over the important waterway as a Hong Kong-based company operates ports on either end of the canal — which the administration has claimed could cut off the U.S. from the canal if Beijing directed it to. However, Panama has repeatedly rejected the claim that China runs the canal.

Trump's comments were in reference to a $23 billion BlackRock Inc.-TiL Consortium deal made with Hutchison Port Holdings, the Hong Kong conglomerate, announced on Tuesday. The consortium, made up of BlackRock Inc., Global Infrastructure Partners and Terminal Investment Limited, would acquire "90% interests in Panama Ports Company (the "PPC Transaction"), which owns and operates the ports of Balboa and Cristobal in Panama," according to a Tuesday press release.

Title: Add the teachers' union to the list of investors worried about Tesla's sliding stock

Volatility in the price of Tesla stock is sparking anxiety beyond Wall Street. Now, a union of 1.8 million teachers is expressing concern about further declines from its sky-high valuation. The American Federation of Teachers has openly questioned Tesla's valuation, urging top asset managers to review investments in the electric vehicle maker. In letters sent to asset managers including BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street, the AFT warned that Tesla's market decline poses a considerable risk to teacher pensions, which have an estimated $4 trillion of members' deferred wages invested, AFT President Randi Weingarten said. The union argued that Tesla stock's aggressive tumble is a growing threat to teachers' retirement funds. The shares are down 42.5% from a mid-December peak, and At $275 per share, they're trading nearly at pre-election levels. "I'm asking the experts, because frankly, if the stock all of a sudden goes down even more precipitously than it has, and tens of billions of dollars are invested in it, then how do you create the replacement income in terms of these retirements?" Weingarten told Yahoo Finance on Monday. At least one of the letters cites a projected price target of $135 for Tesla stock, quoting recent JPMorgan commentary that the shares are "completely divorced" of fundamentals. But the fundamentals themselves are also driving the union's skittishness. "Tesla's latest financial disclosures should raise alarms," the letter said, citing a 23% profit decline and 71% revenue drop year-over-year. Regarding missed fourth-quarter margin expectations, it added, "These are not isolated incidents but rather a troubling pattern that suggests Tesla's pricing power is eroding, leaving it vulnerable to market fluctuations and increased competition." Recent weeks have fuelled the bear case for Tesla, as data from China and Europe reveal declining sales of the company's EVs and heightened competition. According to the German Federal Motor Transport Authority, sales in Germany plummeted 76% in February. Such trends have caught the attention of other investors as well. Ross Gerber, a Tesla-believer-turned-bear, now expects the stock to see even more pain in 2025. While he remains a shareholder, he told Business Insider that he's whittled down his firm's position and he's pessimistic about Tesla's premium valuation. Other bears have also warned about a steep sell-off to come. Earlier this year, Roth MKM analyst Craig Irwin suggested that AI hype has severely overvalued the company, which is why Tesla stock will fall 70% to $85 a share. Weingarten emphasized that the AFT's letters to asset managers were not political, and noted that the union has a history of publishing reports about financial concerns. According to Weingarten, the union has been behind legal action against the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency, due to actions it has taken against the Department of Education. Jump to

Title: Here's what Trump's tariff barrage could mean for your 401(k) plan

Time Published: 2025-03-05T20:03:20Z

Watch CBS News By Aimee Picchi Edited By Alain Sherter Updated on: March 5, 2025 / 4:03 PM EST / CBS News During his Tuesday night address to Congress, President Trump acknowledged his barrage of tariffs might cause "a little disturbance." But with the stock market tumbling this week in reaction to his import duties, workers with 401(k) plans may wonder about how much that disturbance could affect their retirement savings. The S&P 500 has lost about 3% of its value since Friday, with Wall Street tumbling on Monday and Tuesday after Mr. Trump decided to move forward with 25% tariffs on nearly all goods imported from Mexico and Canada, and an additional 10% on Chinese imports. The stock index regained some ground on Wednesday, rising 21 points, or 0.4%, to 5,799 in afternoon trading. According to Wall Street analysts, the market reaction reflects investor concerns that a trade war could crimp U.S. economic growth and reignite inflation, putting pressure on U.S. consumers who are already financially strained after grappling with several years of elevated price increases. Some recent economic data also points to souring outlooks from consumers and businesses, with both groups now expecting higher inflation in the face of Mr. Trump's new tariffs. With uncertainty on the rise, employees exposed to stocks through their retirement plans should brace for more investment volatility, experts say. "There is evidence that a cooling in the economy is underway," Adam Crisafulli, an analyst and founder of Vital Knowledge, told CBS MoneyWatch. "U.S. equities are bearing the brunt of what we're seeing in the U.S. economy right now." The Trump administration has also sometimes sent mixed messages about its tariff plans, with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick on Tuesday night saying the administration might "modify the tariffs somewhat." Those mixed signals add to the challenges facing businesses in deciding their strategy, experts say. Because tariffs are paid by U.S. businesses on goods they import from other nations, some companies are uncertain about the costs they'll face moving forward under the Trump administration, Crisafulli said. "I look at tariffs as a corporate tax," he said. "Imagine if corporate tax rates were set in this chaotic of a fashion — it would create a lot of hesitation among companies. They don't know what the ground rules will be." Walmart executives, noting that the U.S. is entering what they characterized as "an uncertain time," said last month that consumers are paring their spending, while Target on Tuesday said costs from tariffs could put "meaningful pressure" on the retailer's profits. Such caution is also fueling market volatility, experts said. "Uncertainty around the scope and implementation of tariffs is high," investment firm BlackRock said in a March 5 note to investors. "In markets, we think U.S. equities could come under pressure in the next few months as investors seek additional compensation for these risks." While investors spooked by the roller-coaster stock swings might be tempted to exit the market, that's generally a losing strategy, Crisafulli said. Timing the market, or attempting to buy and sell stocks to capture gains and avoid losses, is almost impossible to execute and typically leads to financial losses and lost opportunities, Charles Schwab research has found. The strategy is almost always doomed to fail because investors don't know when to get back into the market to capture the rebound, while the stock market has historically always recovered even from major setbacks. For instance, investors who sold during the March 2020 rout that followed the eruption of COVID-19 around the U.S. and failed to re-enter the market that year could have missed out on the rebound, with the S&P 500 gaining 15% by the end of December. For most investors with a 401(k) plan, sticking tight and avoiding checking your balance each day may be the best strategy for coping with volatile periods, experts say. "Your 401(k) should be on autopilot, and you don't look at day-to-day volatility," Crisafulli said. "I don't think people should make dramatic changes with their 401(k)s." Still, investors may want to examine their asset allocation and shift to investments that could provide more protection in the face of a possible global trade war, researchers note. For instance, automobile companies could be hard-hit by the Trump administration's tariffs, BlackRock notes, given that U.S. automakers import many components from Mexico and Canada. Restaurants and grocery companies could also feel the impact of the new tariffs, as U.S. food costs could increase by 3% due to the higher import duties, BlackRock noted. "On the other hand, financials and health care services may be relatively insulated, since these sectors have minimal exposure to imported goods," the wealth management firm noted. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump vowed that his tariffs "are about making America rich again and making America great again." Some of his goals in implementing the tariffs are to bring about a resurgence in U.S. manufacturing by convincing companies to move factories to the U.S. While that could take months or even years to pan out, investment experts say it's also important to keep a long-term view on the U.S. economy. "It may be hard for investors to believe, but there is more to market volatility than reacting to the latest Trump executive action," Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street, wrote in a new report. Despite recent data that suggests the U.S. economy is slowing, "an economic growth scare is not the same thing as a recession. And the economic environment remains respectable. U.S. real GDP is likely to expand in the first quarter," he added. Given that the economy is continuing to grow, the labor market remains strong and inflation is still cooling, it's important to "differentiate between signal and noise," Arone said. "And, rightly or wrongly, the Trump administration uses the economy and stock market as barometers for its success," he added. "They won't purposefully harm the economy or the bull market."

Title: BlackRock Agrees to Buy Panama Canal Ports as Trump Continues Threats

BlackRock, America’s largest asset manager which handles over $11 trillion in assets, has agreed to purchase two ports on either end of the Panama Canal. BlackRock is buying the ports from Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison in a deal worth about $22.8 billion. The announcement of the deal comes as President Donald Trump has made threats against Panama over China’s involvement in the canal. The president has said the U.S. never should’ve handed over control of the canal in the 1970s after building the canal in the early 20th century. And Trump has even suggested the canal would be taken by force in necessary. Trump boasted in an address to Congress on Tuesday night that the U.S. was “reclaiming the Panama Canal,” without giving details about who was actually buying the ports there. “Just today, a large American company announced they are buying both ports around the Panama Canal and lots of other things having to do with the Panama Canal and a couple of other canals,” Trump said. The part he left out? BlackRock is doing the buying, a company that’s not too popular with Trump’s base. The far-right often casts BlackRock as part of a “globalist” cabal controlling the world, commentary that often surfaces anti-semitic memes about Trump’s business connections. “It was given away by the Carter administration for one dollar, but that agreement has been violated very severely,” Trump said, referring to the 1970s hand-off. “We didn’t give it to China. We gave it to Panama and we’re taking it back.” As CNN notes, the BlackRock deal also includes interests in 199 other berths in 23 countries, though none of those ports have the same geopolitical tensions as the Panama Canal right now. The co-managing director of CK Hutchinson, Frank Sixt, said in a statement posted online that the deal was the result of a “rapid, discrete but competitive process in which numerous bids and expressions of interest were received.” Sixt went on to describe the deal as “compelling” but insisted it had nothing to do with the current geopolitical tensions between the U.S., China, and Panama. “I would like to stress that the Transaction is purely commercial in nature and wholly unrelated to recent political news reports concerning the Panama Ports,” Sixt insisted. “It must be noted that, however, the Transaction does remain subject to confirmatory due diligence, settlement of definitive documentations, and normal and usual completion procedures, adjustments and conditions as well as compliance by HPH with the rights of minority shareholders under existing shareholders agreements relating to the Sold HPH Interests.” Blackrock CEO Larry Fink said in a press release posted online by CK Hutchison that he was “thrilled” about the investment. “This agreement is a powerful illustration of BlackRock and GIPâs combined platform and our ability to deliver differentiated investments for clients,” Fink said. “These world-class ports facilitate global growth. Through our deep connectivity to organizations like Hutchison and MSC/TIL and governments around the world, we are increasingly the first call for partners seeking patient, long-term capital. We are thrilled our clients can participate in this investment.â Will BlackRock’s purchase of two ports at the Panama Canal be enough to please Trump and stop him from threatening the country with military invasion? That part isn’t clear yet. But even if it is, Trump still has plenty of other allies he wants to invade, including Greenland, Mexico, and Canada.

Panama President José Raúl Mulino on Wednesday accused President Trump of lying when he said in his address to Congress that his administration was "reclaiming" the Panama Canal. Trump was referencing a deal announced Tuesday for a consortium led by the US investment management company BlackRock Inc. to buy a controlling stake in the company held by a Chinese group that operates ports at both ends of the Panama Canal.

Panama President José Raúl Mulino has accused U.S. President Donald Trump of lying when Trump said in his address to Congress the night before that his administration was “reclaiming” the Panama Canal PANAMA CITY -- Panama President José Raúl Mulino on Wednesday accused U.S. President Donald Trump of lying when he said in his address to Congress that his administration was “reclaiming” the Panama Canal.

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio met with Mulino in early February and insisted that China was exerting influence over the canal’s operations.

The deal has to be approved by Panama’s government. The United States built the canal in the early 1900s as it looked for ways to facilitate the transit of commercial and military vessels between its coasts. Washington relinquished control of the waterway to Panama on Dec. 31, 1999, under a treaty signed in 1977 by President Jimmy Carter. Trump has claimed that Carter “foolishly” gave the canal away.

Title: Panama President Mulino: Trump's Canal Remarks Are an 'Affront to the Truth and Our Dignity as a Nation'

President of Panama José Raúl Mulino on Wednesday morning accused President Donald Trump of “lying again” after Trump reiterated his call to take back control of the Panama Canal in a speech to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday night. “Once again, President Trump is lying. The Panama Canal is not in the process of recovery and much less is the task that in our conversations with Secretary Rubio or any other has even been discussed,” Mulino said on social media. “On behalf of Panama and all Panamanians, I reject this new affront to the truth and to our dignity as a nation.” “Cooperation between our governments is based on clear understandings on issues of mutual interest, as we have been doing. Nothing has to do either with the ‘recovery of the Canal’ or with sullying our national sovereignty,” he continued. “The Canal is Panamanian and will remain Panamanian!” Trump, during his speech to Congress, said that to enhance national security, the United States will reclaim the Panama Canal and declared “we’ve already started doing it.” He referred to a deal announced hours before the speech between Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison Holdings Limited and asset manager BlackRock for the purchase of a majority stake of Panama Ports Company, a Hutchison subsidiary that, since 1997, has administered two ports located at opposite ends of the Panama Canal. “Just today a large American company announced they are buying both ports around the Panama Canal and lots of other things having to do with the Panama Canal and a couple other canals,” President Trump said. “The Panama Canal was built by Americans for Americans, not for others. But others could use it.” In December, Trump started a debate over the Panama Canal, an interoceanic trade route built by the United States in 1914 and whose control was handed over to Panama in 1999. The canal left American possession under an agreement signed by both nations during the administration of former U.S. President Jimmy Carter in 1977. Trump has repeatedly expressed that the United States should take back control of the Canal due to the “exorbitant” transit fees imposed on U.S. ships. Increasing U.S. stakes in the canal’s operations could forestall China’s growing influence over the important trade route. “It was given away by the Carter administration for $1. But that agreement has been violated very severely. We didn’t give it to China, we gave it to Panama, and we’re taking it back,” President Trump said on Tuesday. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian refuted President Trump’s statements in remarks during his regular briefing on Wednesday. “On the Panama Canal issue, China supports Panama’s sovereignty over the Canal, and stays committed to maintaining the status of the Canal as a permanently neutral international waterway,” Lin said. “China has never engaged in the management and operation of the Canal. Never ever have we interfered. The so-called China’s control over the Canal is nothing but a lie.” The Chinese spokesman asserted that he had “no comment” on the deal between Hutchison and BlackRock, but asserted that China supports Chinese companies, “including” those from Hong Kong, which must abide by Chinese law after the Chinese communist regime ended the “One Country, Two Systems” policy in 2020. “Hope they can have access to a fair and just business environment everywhere they go. We oppose any abuse of coercion and pressuring in international trade and economic relations,” Lin said. The ongoing debate over the Panama Canal has seen several Panamanian and Chinese government officials dismiss President Trump’s claims of Chinese influence in the trade route and calls to have the United States take back control of it. In February, the Chinese embassy in Panama claimed that the accusations made by the United States over Chinese influence in the canal were a “pure lie.” The comment was in response to the then-ongoing two-day visit of United States Southern Command (SOUTHCOM) Commander Adm. Alvin Holsey to the Central American nation. Holsey met with several Panamanian government officials to discuss topics including safeguarding the Panama Canal area from “Chinese Communist Party influence and control.” President Mulino, in a social media post, referred to Adm. Holsey’s visit by stating that the bilateral agenda with the United States is important and relevant — but stressed that, for Panama, it does not involve analyzing “situations that are not true.” President Mulino has repeatedly dismissed any possible negotiations pertaining to returning control of the Panama Canal to the United States, asserting that the trade route will remain fully under Panamanian control. Mulino, after stating that he would wait for President Trump to take office on January 20 before issuing any kind of official response, issued a formal letter to United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres hours after President Trump took office, expressing his “concerns” over Trump’s calls to retake control of the Panama Canal.

Release Timetable: In the dark recesses of Blackrock Mountain’s peak, Nefarian, the eldest son of Deathwing, conducts some of his most awful experimentation, controlling mighty beings like puppets and combining the eggs of different dragonflights with horrific results.

Title: Ryan Breslow is back as CEO of fintech Bolt, after years of controversy

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Ryan Breslow is once again the CEO of Bolt, the fintech company told TechCrunch on Wednesday. Bolt shared a communication that recently went out to investors in which Breslow wrote that “following a challenging few years,” he had been reinstated as Bolt’s CEO with “unanimous approval” of the board of the one-click checkout company. Justin Grooms, who has served as interim CEO since last March, will now serve as president of Bolt. Grooms, the company’s former director of sales, took over as CEO after Maju Kuruvilla was reportedly removed by Bolt’s board. Breslow, the outspoken founder of Bolt, stepped down as CEO in early 2022. Over the years, he has faced allegations that he misled investors and violated security laws by inflating metrics while fundraising the last time he ran the company. Breslow was also embroiled in a legal battle with investor Activant Capital over a $30 million loan he took out. Last September, Bolt shared that it had reached a settlement with Activant Capital. That settlement stipulated that Bolt would repurchase Activant’s shares of Bolt stock, after which Activant would no longer hold any interest in the company. In the communication to investors, as seen by TechCrunch, Breslow thanked the company’s backers for their “support and encouragement” and expressed gratitude to employees. Last year, Bolt was reportedly trying to raise $200 million in equity and an unusual, additional $250 million in “marketing credits,” at a $14 billion valuation. As part of the funding round, Breslow would be re-instated as CEO. By September that deal had apparently stalled. Today, Bolt told TechCrunch that it could not comment on the fundraise. Bolt’s annualized run rate was at $28 million in revenue and the company had $7 million in gross profit as of the end of March of 2024, journalist Eric Newcomer, who also saw copies of the leaked term sheet, reported last August. A valuation of $14 billion would be an enormous multiple over such numbers and higher than that $11 billion valuation achieved in January of 2022. Bolt, which provides software to retailers to speed up checkout, raised around $1 billion in total venture-backed funding and at one time was valued at $11 billion. Investors include funds and accounts managed by BlackRock, Schonfeld, Invus Opportunities, CreditEase, H.I.G. Growth, and Moore Strategic Ventures, among others.

ByBrendan Ahern ByBrendan Ahern , Senior Contributor. CLN At the National People’s Congress, Premier Li provided the government work report. The lack of Western media coverage is interesting, so I pulled out the choice lines. Consumption comes up a lot, indicating where policy support is headed. Artificial intelligence was also explicitly mentioned. Real estate was not as big of a focus, though a large part of the bond issuance is linked to real estate support as local governments have been given more latitude to support project completion. Jonathan Krane’s thesis in creating our firm was to align China investment products with government policy. We are looking good in 2025 as this top-down consumption directive is implemented by government agencies and local governments. Numerically, the report was largely in line with expectations that were low to begin with, though the verbal was stronger than anticipated. It is important that the government recognizes deflation because ignoring it means not fixing it. They did not ignore it. On Thursday, the heads of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, PBOC, and Ministry of Finance are hosting a press conference at 10 am Beijing time. Further articulation of consumption policies would be interesting. China’s Uber for truck drivers company Full Truck Alliance (YMM U.S.) announced Q4 results after the Hong Kong close/pre-U.S. market opened. Asian equities were higher overnight, led by Hong Kong, Thailand, and Indonesia, while Vietnam was off as Trump’s cabinet tried to talk up markets on tariff deals after the close as the U.S. dollar weakened. However, it is important to remember that Trump’s cabinet is made up of staff and not stakeholders, as only the big guy counts. Hong Kong had a strong day, though volumes were a touch light, and advancers trounced decliners, led by Hong Kong’s most heavily traded stocks by value, including Xiaomi, +7.22%; Tencent, +2.95%; Alibaba, +1.64%; Meituan, +6.39%; and Semiconductor Manufacturing International, +6.6%. The NPC’s government work report contributed to Hong Kong-listed growth stocks' strong outperformance, though it was a broad rally. Superman was flying as CK Hutchison (Hong Kong ticker 1, how cool is that) gained +21.86% after selling their Panama ports to BlackRock (founder Li Ka-Shing is known as Superman for his business acumen). Mainland investors bought a net $1.08 billion worth of Hong Kong-listed stocks and ETFs, including Alibaba, which was a large net buy via Southbound Stock Connect. Mainland China had a good, but not great, day as technology and growth stocks also outperformed, though decliners outpaced advancers. Remember, stocks are reflective of consumer confidence. Real estate stocks were a rare underperformer in both markets, though remember there are very few stocks left in MSCI indices, which is why we’ve favored the bonds over the stocks. It is interesting that CATL fell by -0.76% as electric vehicles weren’t highly noted. The Hang Seng and Hang Seng Tech gained 2.84% and 4.02%, respectively, on volume down 4.02% from Tuesday, which is 167% of the 1-year average; 428 stocks advanced, while 65 declined. Main Board short turnover decreased by -12.87% from Tuesday, which is 169% of the 1-year average, as 16% of turnover was short turnover (Hong Kong short turnover includes ETF short volume, which is driven by market makers’ ETF hedging). The growth factor and small capitalization stocks outperformed the value factor and large capitalization stocks. The top-performing sectors were Information Technology, +6.23%; Materials, +3.92%; and Communication Services, +2.99%. Meanwhile, the worst-performing sector was Real Estate, which fell 0.30%. The top-performing subsectors were industry conglomerates, semiconductors, and construction materials. Meanwhile, household appliances were the worst-performing subsector. Southbound Stock Connect volumes were light of late as Mainland investors bought a net $1.076 billion worth of Hong Kong-listed stocks and ETFs, led by Alibaba, a large net buy; Tencent, a moderate net buy; Xiaomi, Ubtech Robotics, and Hua Hong Semiconductors, which were small net buys; SMIC and Meituan were small net sells. Shanghai, Shenzhen, and the STAR Board gained 0.53%, 0.41%, and 0.29%, respectively, on volume up 4.12% from yesterday, which is 129% of the 1-year average; 2,180 stocks advanced, while 2,798 declined. The value factor and large capitalization stocks outperformed the growth factor and small capitalization stocks. The top-performing sectors were communication services, +1.40%; financials, +1.31%; and consumer discretionary, +1.09%. Meanwhile, the worst-performing sectors were real estate, which fell 1.07%; health care, which fell 0.52%; and consumer staples, which did an inverse James Bond to close down by 0.07%. The top-performing subsectors were construction machinery, internet, and telecommunication, while leisure products, petrochemicals, and real estate were the worst. Northbound Stock Connect volumes were above average. CNY and the Asia Dollar Index rose versus the U.S. dollar. The Treasury bond curve steepened. Copper and steel fell.

Essential news coupled with the finest maritime content sourced from across the globe. Photo: Panama Canal Authority (Bloomberg) — One of the biggest infrastructure deals in recent years has a clear winner on Wall Street: Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Goldman is currently the only investment bank working on the sale of CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd. ports to a consortium led by BlackRock Inc., according to people familiar with the matter. The transaction — with proceeds of $19 billion — includes two ports on either side of the Panama Canal, which Donald Trump has long wanted in US hands. A small group of Goldman bankers from Hong Kong to New York, led by senior executives John Waldron and Raghav Maliah, hammered out the transaction in just a couple of weeks. They moved quickly to avoid any leaks, reaching out to various potential suitors including industry players and infrastructure-focused firms, the people said. Blackstone Inc. and KKR & Co. also considered bids. While other investment banks missed out, former Citigroup Inc. Chief Executive Officer Mike Corbat, who founded consultancy firm Teton Advisors, also advised CK Hutchison on the deal, the people said. The Art of the Canal Deal: How BlackRock Brokered Trump Win in Panama The BlackRock consortium isn’t using financial advisers for now, but banks are gunning to land advisory and financing roles with the group, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing private information. Data compiled by Bloomberg show that Goldman has historically been the top adviser to CK Hutchison, founded by billionaire Li Ka-shing. One of Hong Kong’s most prominent companies, CK Hutchison trades locally under the ticker 1.HK. Once the BlackRock consortium showed interest in the port assets, which include the two in Panama and more than 40 others worldwide, there was a rush to sign a memorandum of understanding and file it to the Hong Kong stock exchange ahead of Trump’s address to Congress in Washington, D.C., the people said. In a statement announcing the transaction, Frank Sixt, co-managing director of CK Hutchison, said the deal resulted from a “rapid, discrete but competitive” process — and was unrelated to politics and reports on the Panama Canal ports. CK Hutchison to Sell Panama Port Assets at Center of Geopolitical Storm Corbat and a representative for Goldman declined to comment. CK Hutchison referred questions to its statement. BlackRock didn’t respond to requests seeking comment. The role in such a high profile deal is a boost for Goldman, which is already leading the global M&A league table this year, data compiled by Bloomberg show. CK Hutchison investors got a boost too. The company’s shares jumped 22% in Hong Kong on Wednesday. That’s the biggest one-day gain since 1998, a year before the US gave the government of Panama control of the Panama Canal. © 2025 Bloomberg L.P.

Essential news coupled with the finest maritime content sourced from across the globe. Photo: evenfh / Shutterstock (Bloomberg) — Donald Trump promised on Day 1 to seize the Panama Canal. “We’re taking it back,” the US president declared in his inaugural address. Within weeks, Wall Street billionaire Larry Fink was on the line with the White House. His pitch: Fink’s investment company, BlackRock Inc., was interested in buying the ports on either side of waterway, shifting them into American hands, according to people familiar with the discussion. And with that, there would be no need to have the US take the century-old canal by force. So went days of whirlwind negotiations that now are set to deliver control of those ports to a consortium led by BlackRock, the $11.6 trillion investment giant Fink has run for almost four decades. The deal, which will hand the seller $19 billion, reflects an extraordinary confluence of Trump’s America First vision and Wall Street’s globe-spanning quest for profit. Trump has repeatedly expressed his desire to regain US ownership of the Panama Canal, which he has claimed, without evidence, is run by China. Fink capitalized on that desire to secure the biggest infrastructure deal in BlackRock’s history – handing Trump a win as the president flexes over international trade, the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, NATO and more. The deal is also a sign of Fink’s and BlackRock’s ambitions to clinch major deals in far-flung private markets and compete with the biggest alternative asset managers. In a statement announcing the transaction Tuesday, he boasted of BlackRock’s ties to companies and governments around the world, noting: “We are increasingly the first call.” When Trump took the lectern Tuesday night for a primetime address, he hailed the deal as a step toward “reclaiming” the canal for the US. He didn’t use BlackRock’s name. “Just today, a large American company announced they are buying both ports around the Panama Canal and lots of other things having to do with the Panama Canal and a couple of other canals,” he said. “The Panama Canal was built by Americans for Americans, not for others.” BlackRock said it agreed to buy the two ports in Panama and more than 40 others around the world from CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd., the sprawling conglomerate controlled by the Li family, one of Asia’s richest clans. In recent months, the Hong Kong family found itself thrust into the center of a political firestorm over who controls the crucial waterway and key ports. For Trump, having a US investment company take over the ports would reduce China’s influence in the region, according to people familiar with the talks, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity given the delicate diplomacy. The deal wouldn’t have come together without Trump’s support, these people said. BlackRock is acquiring the operations with Global Infrastructure Partners, an infrastructure firm it bought last year and is headed by Adebayo Ogunlesi. Other investors include Terminal Investment Ltd., which operates ports served by the world’s largest shipping company, Mediterranean Shipping. Fink has moved in Trump’s circles for years, and people close to the deal say his personal involvement was crucial. In recent days, Fink briefed Trump as the talks quickly unfolded. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Secretary of State Marco Rubio were also kept in the loop. In a statement, Frank Sixt, co-managing director of CK Hutchison, said the deal resulted from a “rapid, discrete but competitive” process — and was unrelated to politics. Blackstone Inc. and KKR & Co. also considered bids, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Representatives for both firms declined to comment. The White House didn’t respond to a request for comment. CK Hutchison’s American depositary receipts rose as much as 3.4% to $6.02 at the start of trading Wednesday. They gained 17% on Tuesday. Panama will review the transaction and an audit of the Panama Ports contract will continue, according to a statement posted on Panama President Jose Raul Mulino’s account on X. Under terms disclosed Tuesday, BlackRock, GIP and Terminal Investment will acquire units that hold 80% of the Hutchison Ports group. The consortium will also acquire 90% of Panama Ports Co., which operates the two ports in Balboa and Cristobal, on either side of the Panama Canal. “We’ll probably have ownership of the Panama Canal ones very shortly,” Fink told a financial industry conference Tuesday. As Trump publicly complained about China’s influence over the canal, Panama’s government weighed whether to cancel its contract with CK Hutchison to operate the ports, Bloomberg reported last month. That arose even though CK Hutchison is based in Hong Kong, a Chinese territory with its own borders, currency and legal system. Beijing has clamped down on the former British colony since 2020 when it imposed a broad national security law that paved the way for a crackdown on dissent. Reached Wednesday morning in Asia, CK Hutchison referred to Sixt’s earlier statement. In it, he said, “I would like to stress that the transaction is purely commercial in nature and wholly unrelated to recent political news reports concerning the Panama Ports.” © 2025 Bloomberg L.P.

Title: Panama president says Trump is lying about reclaiming Panama Canal

Watch CBS News March 5, 2025 / 11:21 AM EST / CBS/AP Panama President José Raúl Mulino on Wednesday accused U.S. President Donald Trump of lying when he said in his Tuesday address to a joint session of Congress that his administration was "reclaiming" the Panama Canal. Mr. Trump was referencing a deal announced Tuesday for a consortium led by the U.S. investment management company BlackRock Inc. to buy a controlling stake in the company held by a Hong-Kong based group that operates ports near both ends of the Panama Canal. The announcement came after the president alleged Chinese interference with operations of the critical shipping lane. Panama maintains that it has full control over the canal and that the Hong Kong-based group's operation of the ports did not amount to Chinese control over the waterway, and that therefore the sale to a U.S.-based company would not represent any U.S. "reclaiming" of the canal. Panama's government on Tuesday called the sale a private transaction. Mulino, in a message posted to X on Wednesday, rejected that the deal came about because of U.S. pressure. "I reject in the name of Panama and all Panamanians this new affront to the truth and our dignity as a nation," he wrote in the post translated from Spanish. He accused Mr. Trump of "lying again." "The Panama Canal is not in the process of being restored, and this is certainly not the task that was even discussed in our conversations with Secretary Rubio or anyone else," Mulino continued. CBS News fact-checked the president's remarks to Congress here, reviewing his claims about the Panama Canal in addition to other issues. Mr. Trump has talked about retaking the Panama Canal since his campaign, arguing that the U.S. should have never turned control over to the Panamanians and that the U.S. was being overcharged for using it. Mulino previously denied publicly the U.S. State Department's claim that his country had reached a deal to allow U.S. warships to transit the Panama Canal for free. The Panamanian leader said in early February that he had told Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth that he could not set the fees to transit the canal nor exempt anyone from them, adding at the time that he was surprised the State Department had issued a statement suggesting otherwise. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio met with Mulino around the same time and insisted that China was exerting influence over the canal's operations. The focus was the Chinese consortium running the ports. Panama rejected that China had any influence over canal operations. "Cooperation between our governments passes through clear understandings in terms of issues of mutual interest," Mulino wrote. "It doesn't have anything to do with 'reclaiming the canal' nor with tarnishing our national sovereignty." In a filing, CK Hutchison Holding said Tuesday that it would sell all shares in Hutchison Port Holdings and in Hutchison Port Group Holdings to the BlackRock consortium in a deal valued at nearly $23 billion, including $5 billion in debt. The deal has to be approved by Panama's government. The United States built the canal in the early 1900s as it looked for ways to facilitate the transit of commercial and military vessels between its coasts. Washington relinquished control of the waterway to Panama on Dec. 31, 1999, under a treaty signed in 1977 by President Jimmy Carter. Mr. Trump has claimed that Carter "foolishly" gave the canal away. Frank Sixt, co-managing director of CK Hutchison, said in a statement that the transaction was "the result of a rapid, discrete but competitive process in which numerous bids and expressions of interest were received." "I would like to stress that the transaction is purely commercial in nature and wholly unrelated to recent political news reports concerning the Panama Ports," Sixt said. © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

Title: Improving Blockchain Data Usability: A Key to Unlocking Institutional Capital

Data is an essential element of an efficient market. If market efficiency is the degree to which prices reflect all available information, having quality information is crucial. And to get to information, you need data. Traditional financial markets are data-rich and have high levels of standardization and accessibility, giving market participants abundant avenues for analysis. Digital asset markets are awash in data, but this data has less structure and little standardization, complicating many aspects of fundamental and quantitative analysis. It’s somewhat ironic that data is a sticking point for digital assets since a much-lauded aspect of public blockchains is their transparency. Transactions and data on the blockchain are available essentially immediately to anyone with access to the system. But transparency does not equal accessibility and, much less so usability. Without prioritizing accessibility, dissemination and context, masses of raw blockchain data won’t automatically improve crypto market efficiency. And while blockchain data complexity may create alpha for savvy analysts, the lack of consistent data likely contributes to volatility, deterring institutional capital. You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday. Until now, the somewhat disjointed state of blockchain data has not been an issue given a market dominated by retail flows. But if the market is to ultimately become institutionalized (that is, garner the involvement of serious allocators like pensions, endowments, and insurance), it needs to evolve. To improve, the digital asset space can learn from traditional market approaches. Tokens are expected to accrue value in line with a project’s success. Thus, key performance indicators (KPIs) should be readily accessible, acting like “investor relations” pages for token holders. It’s unrealistic for start-up crypto projects to disclose information like public corporations do, but interim steps can improve the situation. For example, there are data points that could be relevant for almost all projects to disclose, including: supply schedules (with details of inflation and burn mechanisms, as well as unlocks), fees, active users and daily transactions. Naturally, projects will not have all the same indicators — for example, KPIs for a smart contract platform will look different than those for an application or DeFi protocol. Smart contract platforms may want to show how many apps are deployed in the ecosystem. DeFi protocols may want to showcase TVL or volumes. Regardless of utility, each project should make an effort to disclose as many data points as possible. Critically, this data should have detailed definitions and methodologies, along with reproducible code for how the information is derived from the blockchain. It should also be available with complete histories through time, and be easily downloadable or accessible via APIs. Efforts by projects to systematically disseminate key information should reduce uncertainty (and thereby volatility) and aid capital inflows into the crypto space. Investors should expect this level of transparency and reward projects that prioritize showcasing KPIs, while pushing for improvement at portfolio companies that do not. Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, noted in a recent earnings call that more transparency and analytics could broaden digital asset investment, akin to the evolution of markets like mortgages and high-yield bonds. There are already strong players like Artemis that are providing blockchain data and analytics and setting standards for digital finance. Such providers will be essential, just as platforms like Bloomberg and S&P’s Capital IQ are in the traditional markets. However, each project building digital assets should do their part to enhance data availability for investors. As the crypto market matures in transparency and analytics, as many other nascent markets did before it, the scope for investment in the space should expand materially.

Title: US: Supreme Court blocks Trump's freeze of $2 billion in aid

The US president revised the 25% tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico a day after implementing them. Meanwhile, Canada filed a WTO complaint against the new US tariffs. This blog has been closed. Thanks very much for reading. Below you can review developments from Donald Trump's first weeks in office on Thursday, February 13, 2025: New Zealand has dismissed its ambassador to the United Kingdom, Phil Goff, over comments critical of US President Donald Trump. Goff seemingly questioned Trump's understanding of history in comments at a forum organized by the Chatham House think tank in London on Tuesday. "President Trump has restored the bust of Churchill to the Oval Office. But do you think he really understands history?" Goff said. Goff contrasted Trump's stated policy of seeking a peace deal with Russia in Ukraine with British leader Winston Churchill's criticism of his predecessor, Neville Chamberlain, over signing the Munich Agreement that allowed Nazi Germany to annex the Sudetenland area of Czechoslovakia a year before the start of World War II. New Zealand Foreign Minister Winston Peters described Goff's remarks as "deeply disappointing." "They do not represent the views of the NZ Government and make his position as High Commissioner to London untenable," he said. The chief of staff to House Speaker Mike Johnson, Hayden Haynes, was arrested on Tuesday night after he crashed into a police vehicle following Donald Trump's address to Congress. Haynes was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence and was later released. Police said that Haynes had "backed into a parked vehicle" shortly before midnight. Johnson's office said that the speaker was aware of the incident. "The Speaker is aware of the encounter that occurred last night involving his Chief of Staff and the Capitol Police," spokesperson Taylor Haulsee said. "The Speaker has full faith and confidence in Hayden's ability to lead the speaker's office." The Trump administration's decision to pause US foreign aid would undo progress made in containing tuberculosis (TB) infections across low- and middle-income countries,the World Health Organization said. "Without immediate action, hard-won progress in the fight against TB is at risk. Our collective response must be swift, strategic, and fully resourced to protect the most vulnerable and maintain momentum toward ending TB," said Tereza Kasaeva, director of WHO's Global Program on TB and Lung Health. Critical international aid, particularly from the US Agency for International Development (USAID), helped avert about 3.65 million deaths from the deadly disease last year alone, according to the agency. The US has historically contributed about one quarter of the total international donor funding for TB programs, which amounts to about $200 million (€185.3 million) to $250 million annually in bilateral funding, the WHO said. USAID has been one of the major targets of the Trump administration's efforts to downsize the federal government, a campaign spearheaded by billionaire Elon Musk, who heads Trump's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). The Trump administration is looking to cut back over 80,000 jobs at the Department of Veterans Affairs, an agency that provides health care and other services for millions of veterans, according to an internal memo seen by news agencies. The internal memo, first reported by Government Executive, looks to "resize and tailor the workforce to the mission and revised structure." The memo calls for agency officials to work with the White House’s Department of Government Efficiency to "move out aggressively, while taking a pragmatic and disciplined approach" to the Trump administration’s goals. The VA’s chief of staff, Christopher Syrek, told top-level officials at the agency Tuesday that it had an objective to cut enough employees to return to 2019 staffing levels of just under 400,000.

The Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) blocked the USDA from terminating probationary employees for 45 days. allowing the board to investigate the firings. The decision, issued by board member Cathy Harris, comes a day after a federal judge prevented Trump from removing her from her position. The move is seen as a significant obstacle to the Trump administration's efforts to carry out mass layoffs. Canada has filed a complaint with the World Trade Organization (WTO) against the United States. Canadian Ambassador to the WTO, Nadia Theodore, said her government had "requested WTO consultations with the government of the United States regarding its unjustified tariffs." WTO consultations are the first step of the international body's dispute settlement procedure. The two parties have 60 days to settle the matter before the claimant can request that a panel be set up to rule on it. A WTO official confirmed to AFP that "Canada initiated dispute proceedings yesterday against the US at the WTO on the additional tariffs," following a similar complaint filed by Beijing over fresh US levies on Chinese goods. Donald Trump says he will grant a one-month exemption for US automakers from new tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada. The US president's 25% tariffs on all imports from Mexico and Canada took effect on Tuesday, along with a doubling of duties on Chinese goods to 20%. The White House, however, said on Wednesday that after talks with Ford, General Motors, and Stellantis, Trump will allow a one-month exemption from tariffs on auto imports from the neighboring countries. Tariffs create significant challenges for North American automakers. They build vehicles in all three countries and often move parts across international borders several times while assembling them into systems and finished vehicles. In an online post, President Donald Trump said Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had called him "to ask what could be done about Tariffs." "I told him that many people have died from Fentanyl that came through the Borders of Canada and Mexico, and nothing has convinced me that it has stopped," Trump wrote. "He said that it’s gotten better, but I said, 'That’s not good enough.'" The US president also said that the call ended in a somewhat friendly manner. Trump has imposed broad tariffs on Canada, Mexico on Tuesday, citing an "extraordinary threat" from illegal immigration and drugs. Trudeau slammed the tariffs on calling it a "very dumb thing to do" and announced retaliatory measures. Trump also accused the Canadian leader of playing up a Canada-US trade war to cling to power. Trudeau, who announced his resignation in January, is to step down after a Liberal party leadership contest this weekend which will choose his replacement US President Trump was considering modifying the 25% tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said. The announcement could come as early as Wednesday, only a day after Trump's tariffs were imposed on Canada, Mexico, and China. Lutnick dismissed the possibility of lifting the levies completely but signaled potential relief for specific sectors such as automakers. "But what he's thinking about is which sections of the market that can maybe, maybe, he'll consider giving them relief until we get to, of course, April 2," Lutnick said. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video On April 2, Trump plans to announce what he calls "reciprocal" tariffs to match the tariffs, taxes, and subsidies from other countries. However, Canada has already stated that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is not willing to lift Canada's retaliatory tariffs unless Trump removes all tariffs. "We're not interested in meeting in the middle and having some reduced tariff. Canada wants the tariffs removed," Canadian Finance Minister Dominic LeBlanc told the Canadian national broadcaster. In his address to Congress, US President Donald Trump accused Mexican drug cartels of already "waging war on America," adding that "it's time for America to wage war on the cartels." The accusations were launched on the same day his administration announced 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada. Trump claims the tariffs are an appropriate response to what he believes is a failure of the Mexican government to stop illegal drugs from entering the US. "The territory to the immediate south of our border is now dominated entirely by criminal cartels that murder, rape, torture and exercise total control," he told Congress. Mexican president Claudia Sheinbaum last month announced a deployment of additional 10,000 troops to the US-Mexico border. The US Supreme Court ruled on Wednesday that President Donald Trump's administration cannot stop payments to foreign aid organizations for work they have already completed for the government. The court supported US District Judge Amir Ali's decision, which ordered the Trump administration to quickly release funding to contractors and grant recipients from the US Agency for International Development (USAID) and the State Department for their past work. Ali had ordered the US State Department and USAID to pay nearly $2 billion to contractors by midnight on Wednesday last week. The Trump administration turned to the Supreme Court as the deadline approached. They argued that handling claims properly in such a short time was impossible. By a 5-4 vote, the Supreme Court told Ali to "clarify what obligations the government must fulfill to ensure compliance with the temporary restraining order, with due regard for the feasibility of any compliance timelines." The court's decision, however, keeps Ali's temporary restraining order in place, which stopped the spending freeze.

In his first speech to Congress after becoming president again, Trump welcomed a deal by a group led by giant asset manager BlackRock to acquire two Panama Canal ports He described this deal as an early step in his administration's plan to "reclaim" the important waterway. President Mulino, however accused Trump of "once again lying" in a post on X, formerly Twitter. "The Panama Canal is not in the process of being reclaimed... the Canal is Panamanian and will continue to be Panamanian!" Panama, took over control of the crucial international waterway in 1999 under a treaty negotiated with the United States 20 years earlier. Trump has repeatedly threatened to "take back" control of the Panama Canal. A consortium led by US firm BlackRock has agreed to purchase the ports of Balboa and Cristobal on either end of the canal from a Hong Kong-based company CK Hutchison. The canal is home to several other ports. Greenland's prime minister said, "Greenland is ours" and cannot be taken or sold. This was in response to President Donald Trump, who told Congress the United States would acquire the territory "one way or another." "Kalaallit Nunaat is ours," Prime Minister Múte Bourup Egede wrote, using Greenlandic for the "Land of the People" or the "Land of the Greenlanders." Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, in an interview with broadcaster TV2, echoed Egede in repeating that Greenland is not for sale. Located in the Arctic Circle, Greenland sits between Canada and northern Europe. Although an autonomous territory, it is still ruled by the Danish crown. Any American effort to acquire Greenland would therefore have to include Denmark.

PANAMA CITY (AP) — Panama President José Raúl Mulino on Wednesday accused U.S. President Donald Trump of lying when he said in his address to Congress that his administration was “reclaiming” the Panama Canal.Trump was referencing a deal announced Tuesday for a consortium led by the U.S. investment management company BlackRock Inc. to buy a controlling stake in the company held by a Chinese group that operates ports at both ends of the Panama Canal.Panama maintains that it has full control over the canal and that the Hong Kong-based group’s operation of the ports did not amount to Chinese control over the waterway, and that therefore the sale to a U.S.-based company would not represent any U.S. “reclaiming” of the canal. Panama’s government on Tuesday called the sale a private transaction.Mulino in a message posted to X on Wednesday, rejected that the deal came about because of U.S. pressure. “I reject in the name of Panama and all Panamanians this new affront to the truth and our dignity as a nation,” he wrote. He accused Trump of “lying again.”Trump has talked about retaking the Panama Canal since his campaign, arguing that the U.S. should have never turned control over to the Panamanians and that the U.S. was being overcharged for using it.U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio met with Mulino in early February and insisted that China was exerting influence over the canal’s operations. The focus was the Chinese consortium running the ports. Panama rejected that China had any influence over canal operations.“Cooperation between our governments passes through clear understandings in terms of issues of mutual interest,” Mulino wrote. “It doesn’t have anything to do with ‘reclaiming the canal’ nor with tarnishing our national sovereignty.”In a filing, CK Hutchison Holding said Tuesday that it would sell all shares in Hutchison Port Holdings and in Hutchison Port Group Holdings to the BlackRock consortium in a deal valued at nearly $23 billion, including $5 billion in debt. The deal has to be approved by Panama’s government.The United States built the canal in the early 1900s as it looked for ways to facilitate the transit of commercial and military vessels between its coasts. Washington relinquished control of the waterway to Panama on Dec. 31, 1999, under a treaty signed in 1977 by President Jimmy Carter. Trump has claimed that Carter “foolishly” gave the canal away.Frank Sixt, co-managing director of CK Hutchison, said in a statement that the transaction was “the result of a rapid, discrete but competitive process in which numerous bids and expressions of interest were received.”“I would like to stress that the transaction is purely commercial in nature and wholly unrelated to recent political news reports concerning the Panama Ports,” Sixt said. Trump was referencing a deal announced Tuesday for a consortium led by the U.S. investment management company BlackRock Inc. to buy a controlling stake in the company held by a Chinese group that operates ports at both ends of the Panama Canal. Panama maintains that it has full control over the canal and that the Hong Kong-based group’s operation of the ports did not amount to Chinese control over the waterway, and that therefore the sale to a U.S.-based company would not represent any U.S. “reclaiming” of the canal.

The deal has to be approved by Panama’s government. The United States built the canal in the early 1900s as it looked for ways to facilitate the transit of commercial and military vessels between its coasts. Washington relinquished control of the waterway to Panama on Dec. 31, 1999, under a treaty signed in 1977 by President Jimmy Carter. Trump has claimed that Carter “foolishly” gave the canal away. Frank Sixt, co-managing director of CK Hutchison, said in a statement that the transaction was “the result of a rapid, discrete but competitive process in which numerous bids and expressions of interest were received.” “I would like to stress that the transaction is purely commercial in nature and wholly unrelated to recent political news reports concerning the Panama Ports,” Sixt said.

Following its inclusion in Donald Trump’s newly announced US Crypto Reserve, Ethereum’s price prediction for 2025 has become one of the hottest topics of debate among crypto enthusiasts and pundits. While a vast majority is expecting $ETH to ride the positive momentum and finally break out of its long-drawn sideways channel, some say there’s more price correction in store. In this guide, we’ll let Ethereum speak to us; we’ll analyze its technicals and fundamentals to draw out a clear picture of where we think the second-biggest crypto in the world could be headed in the coming 10 months. If you’re after a quick answer, here’s everything you need to know about $ETH’s upcoming performance: Overall, since the higher timeframes override the smaller ones, and because the market sentiment also screams bullishness, $ETH’s larger picture looks very positive. Once it breaks and holds above a lower high, many feel we can expect $ETH to reach new highs, including the $6K mark, in 2025. The best way to go about technical analysis is to start from the higher timeframes and then scoot lower. This helps establish a strong understanding of the overall direction of the cryptocurrency — whether certain short-term trends are aligned with the larger picture or just temporary price corrections. With that in mind, we’ll start our analysis at $ETH’s weekly chart. Right off the bat, we notice that Ethereum is at a major support zone (between $1.9K and $2.3K). This is where $ETH took support in November last year before bouncing to $4K. Additionally, this support zone also contains the $2K mark, which is an important psychological number. For those unaware, round figures such as this often act as strong support and resistance levels. The $2K level, in particular, is a very notable one, seeing as $ETH has reacted to it almost every single time ever since it first touched it all the way back in February 2021. Another massive positive sign is that $ETH (on the weekly chart) is currently at and reacting to the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA), which is one of the most prominent indicators of technical analysis. Given that $BTC (on the daily chart) bounced off the 200 EMA less than a week ago, we can expect $ETH to do the same. According to Glassnode, a blockchain analytics firm, the $1.9K price point is also a major accumulation zone, with over 1.82M $ETH being bought at it by long-term investors since August 2023. Having mentioned the various reasons $ETH looks ripe for an upward rally, the biggest clue we get about its upcoming prices is through the good old rectangle pattern. Simply put, Ethereum has been trapped between the $2K and $4K levels. Plus, given that this has been the case for almost a year now, a breakout above the ceiling ($4K) could see $ETH reach a new high that’s as far away as the breadth of the rectangle. The upper and lower limits of the rectangle, in this case, are $2K apart, meaning we can expect $ETH to cross $6K once it breaks above $4K. Although the weekly timeframe is the boss and dictates the larger picture, the daily and 4-hour timeframes often provide an excellent outlook for the short term. Unfortunately, though, the two major moving averages (50 EMA and 200 EMA) are both sloping downwards on these timeframes. This suggests that institutional buying is yet to enter the market. However, trends in crypto could change in hours because large buying often results in towering candlesticks, and just a couple of those would be enough to throw $ETH over the EMAs. $ETH is up 5.75% today and is currently trading at around $2,200. The latest surge in its price is likely due to its inclusion in Trump’s Crypto Strategic Reserve. It is, after all, one of the only five cryptos that made it to the list. Not only is the amount huge, but $ETH also makes up nearly 65% of the firm’s entire $300M+ crypto portfolio. Clearly, Trump is backing Ethereum to hit it out of the park, which is one of the biggest reasons the $6K target looks extremely realistic. Also, Ethereum is the only other crypto besides Bitcoin to have spot ETFs (exchange-traded funds), which is a huge positive as far as investor participation in $ETH is concerned. The fact that BlackRock ‘likes’ Ethereum is nothing to sniff at, either. The asset management company launched a tokenized money market fund last year, and it chose Ethereum as its blockchain of choice for this fund. In other news, Ethereum is also nearing a huge Pectra upgrade. It was successfully deployed on the Sepolia testnet today, and Pectra’s mainnet is expected to launch in April. This update will consist of 11 major features, which will together make the Ethereum ecosystem more user-friendly, affordable, and efficient. For instance, the validator staking limit will be increased from 32 $ETH to 2,048 $ETH. In addition to being a game-changer for validators, who will be able to compound their earnings, this move is expected to reduce selling pressure over a long enough time period. What’s more, we’ll see a bunch of wallet and security improvements, too. These include batched transactions, gas sponsorship, application-wise spending limits, and different recovery mechanisms. With Ethereum expected to nearly triple in price this year, it’s certainly shaping up to be a great investment choice for traditional crypto traders. However, for those with an appetite for higher risks and rewards, the Meme Index ($MEMEX) presale could be a better pick. The $MEMEX presale is fast approaching the $4M mark, and each token is currently available for just $0.0166883 — here’s how to buy $MEMEX if you’re looking to get in as an early investor. What’s more, you’ll also be able to benefit from the project’s 579% staking rewards. Last but not least, we’d like to mention that although our analysis and experience tell us that both $ETH and $MEMEX are excellent crypto investment opportunities, this article shouldn’t be considered a substitute for professional financial advice.

Global trade observers, who continue to assess the changing geo-political power equation and subsequent probability of tariff war and control over strategic assets like ports, say this implies US control extending to multiple entities in nearly two dozen countries, on a key trade route that will include a presence in Europe, Egypt, and Asia, among others. However, there will be no direct impact on India, senior Shipping Ministry officials here told businessline. “Not much of our cargo goes through the Panama Canal, so the impact on trade is limited. But, we will have to keep a watch on how things progress,” the person tracking these developments said. “But, the US’ presence through a BlackRock-led consortium will expand to many strategic assets possibly,” a second official said. Concerns on how retaliatory tariffs could impact container freight rates have also surfaced, but it’s early days still. The $23-billion deal BlackRock’s deal with Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison is worth $22.8 billion. The companies in a joint statement said they have reached in-principle agreements whereby the BlackRock-TiL Consortium will acquire HPH’s 90 per cent interests in the Panama Ports Company, which owns and operates the ports of Balboa and Cristobal in Panama (also called the Panama Terminals); and 80 per cent of CK Hutchison’s effective and controlling interest in subsidiary and associated companies - owning, operating and developing a total of 43 ports comprising 199 berths in 23 countries. The ports sale does not include any interest in the HPH Trust, which operates ports in Hong Kong, Shenzhen and South China, or any other ports in China. Control for Panama Canal This sale is being seen as a major victory for US President Donald Trump, who has been insisting on taking control of the Panama Canal. This transaction is “purely commercial in nature and wholly unrelated to recent political news reports concerning the Panama Ports,” asserted CK Hutchison Co-Managing Director Frank Sixt in a statement. Nearly 40 per cent of American ships use the Panama Canal, but it accounts for about 5 per cent of global trade, and is a key link between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. The canal is used extensively for trade between the US East Coast and Asia. According to Jagannarayan Padmanabhan, Senior Director & Global Head (transport, mobility, and logistics) at Crisil Intelligence, the BlackRock deal means the US is “securing its supply chain”. “So the US will have more control over the ships; and a better hold over supplies entering through the country’s east coast, one of its major trade routes,” he said. Padmanabhan says there will be hardly “any direct impact on the trade with India”, but the more important issue to be looked into are “how the retaliatory tariff action will play out”. “Normally, you will continue to see export activity happening from the East Coast – Asia, including India – to the West – USA; and empty containers moving out of the US,” he said. Container price movement According to the Drewry container index, prices decreased 6 per cent to $2,629 per 40 ft container beginning March, 75 per cent below the pandemic peak of $10,377 (September 2021), and the lowest since May 2024. Freight rates from Shanghai to Los Angeles decreased 11 per cent or $411 to $3,477 per 40ft container, closely followed by the rates on Shanghai to New York, which decreased 10 per cent or $533 to $4,593 per 40ft container. Rates from Shanghai to Genoa fell 2 per cent or $90 to $3,747 per 40ft container, and those from Shanghai to Rotterdam and Rotterdam to New York reduced 1 per cent to $2,586 and $2,374 per 40ft container, respectively. On the other hand, rates from Rotterdam to Shanghai, and New York to Rotterdam increased 1 per cent to $503 and $835 per 40ft container, respectively. Meanwhile, rates from Los Angeles to Shanghai remained stable. Drewry expects rates to continue to decrease next week due to increased shipping capacity, it said in a report.
