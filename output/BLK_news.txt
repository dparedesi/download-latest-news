Imagine a young professional in Nairobi buying a digital slice of a new apartment building, a cattle farmer in Bolivia selling tokens backed by his herd, or a street vendor in Mumbai investing in a fraction of a tech company’s stock – all through a smartphone. This isn’t sci‑fi finance; it’s the promise of fractionalisation and tokenisation. These buzzwords are redefining who gets to own assets and how, especially across Africa, Latin America, and Asia. In this long read, we’ll demystify what tokenisation and fractionalisation really mean, explore why they matter for financially underserved populations, and dive into real‑world examples in real estate, equities, and even livestock. The goal: help you understand (and maybe even get excited about) how a fractional future could unlock wealth and opportunity in emerging markets. Demystifying Tokenisation and Fractionalisation Let’s start with the basics. Tokenisation is essentially turning an asset or a right into a digital token – a kind of digital certificate of ownership recorded on a blockchain. Think of a token as a digital deed or share that proves you own something of value. It could be a token representing a square meter of land, a share of stock, or one cow in a herd. Once created, these tokens live on a blockchain, making their ownership records immutable and tamper‑proof. In practical terms, tokenisation often uses smart contracts (self‑executing code on the blockchain) to automate the process of splitting and managing ownership. For example, a property could be divided into digital shares via a smart contract so that investors can buy or sell parts of it by trading tokens. These tokens can be designed to carry information like ownership rights, dividend or rental entitlements, and transaction history – all baked into code. Fractionalisation, on the other hand, is the process of splitting an asset into smaller pieces (fractions) so that multiple people can own a portion of it. It’s a concept as old as joint ownership, but blockchain‑based tokenisation turbocharges it. If tokenisation is turning an asset into a tradable digital form, fractionalisation is what lets many people hold a piece of that digital asset. An easy analogy is slicing a big pizza: Instead of one person devouring a whole pie, it’s cut into slices so a group can each enjoy a piece. In finance, this means a million‑dollar asset can be split into, say, a million $1 tokens. Each token holder owns a tiny slice. By combining tokenisation with fractionalisation, almost any asset can be divided and distributed to many owners quickly and with low friction. A simple example: imagine a $100,000 real estate property represented by 100,000 tokens – each token might represent a $1 stake in the property’s value and any corresponding rental income. You could buy 50 tokens for $50 and legitimately claim 0.05% ownership. Thanks to blockchain’s transparency, everyone’s fractional ownership is securely recorded and easily verifiable. The beauty of this “power couple” of finance is that it brings automation, security, and trust to shared ownership. Blockchains operate 24/7, so these tokens can be traded peer‑to‑peer at any time, without the heavy paperwork of traditional asset sales. Transfers are near‑instant and don’t rely on a parade of middlemen for clearing or settlement, which reduces costs and friction. Smart contracts can even handle things like distributing dividends or rental income to token holders automatically (no accountant writing 1000 cheques). In short, tokenisation turns assets into programmable pieces and fractionalisation ensures even the “little guy” can hold a piece. Why Tokenisation Matters for Emerging Markets So, why should someone in an emerging market care about these fancy concepts? Because they have the potential to democratize finance and unlock access in places where traditional systems haven’t fully delivered. In many emerging economies, large segments of the population are underserved by banks or excluded from investing. Owning property or stocks is often a luxury reserved for the wealthy or well‑connected. Meanwhile, many people store their wealth in informal assets – cash stashed under a mattress, gold jewelry, or livestock in the field – because formal investments feel out of reach. Tokenisation directly tackles some of these barriers: All these reasons boil down to one big theme: financial inclusion. By breaking big assets into bite‑sized digital pieces, tokenisation and fractionalisation extend the investing club to far more people. Importantly, this isn’t just theoretical. It’s already underway in various forms across emerging markets. Let’s delve into three key asset classes – real estate, equities, and livestock – to see how it works in practice and why it matters. Real Estate: Owning Property One Token at a Time Real estate is often seen as a stable way to build wealth, but owning property traditionally requires huge upfront capital and involves plenty of red tape. In cities from Lagos to Lahore, property prices can be stratospheric relative to local incomes, meaning the vast majority can only ever dream of owning a piece of prime real estate. Tokenisation is starting to change that equation by dividing bricks and mortar into bits and bytes. Take Kenya, for example. The Kenyan government is building a high‑tech new city called Konza Technopolis, with a hefty budget running into billions. It’s the kind of large‑scale project that typically only big investors or funds would have a stake in. But imagine everyone being able to own a slice of that city’s development through fractional tokens. Kenya’s regulators are already looking ahead by admitting blockchain‑based real estate platforms into controlled regulatory sandboxes. These pilots use smart contracts to automate splitting property into digital shares, letting investors buy and sell fractional ownership. The authorities see these models as an “important stride” toward enhancing retail participation in the real estate market, giving ordinary Kenyans access to a highly coveted asset class that was previously out of reach. Other African nations are dipping toes in as well. South Africa has seen tokenised commercial property deals, and Nigeria is exploring tokenised real estate in Lagos to attract retail investors. Even where formal projects are still nascent, the interest is high. In Uganda, for instance, innovators have crunched the numbers on how fractional ownership could work. Consider a commercial building valued at a significant sum; it could be tokenised into hundreds of thousands of tokens, each representing a tiny ownership stake. An investor buying a modest number of tokens would own a small percentage of the building and earn a proportional share of the rental income. And when the investor wants out, they could sell their tokens to someone else, rather than having to endure a months‑long property sale. It effectively transforms a brick‑and‑mortar asset into a liquid investment. The benefits for the broader market are significant. By lowering the barrier to entry, tokenised real estate can tap into pools of capital that were previously sidelined. A middle‑class family in Accra or a collective of school teachers in Lima could pool funds to back a housing development via tokens. This democratises funding for projects – potentially helping address housing shortages. Liquidity is another plus: real estate usually can’t be sold quickly, but token markets promise more fluid trading. It’s not just startups and crypto enthusiasts pushing this. Even major global players are on board, lending credibility. Firms like Goldman Sachs and BlackRock have launched initiatives in tokenised assets, indicating that a significant chunk of assets may shift on‑chain in coming years. That institutional vote of confidence bodes well for emerging markets adopting similar tech. And regulators, while cautious, are increasingly open‑minded. Beside Kenya’s sandbox, jurisdictions like Hong Kong and Thailand are actively updating laws to accommodate tokenised real‑world assets. The upshot for a banker or regulator in an emerging market is clear: this trend is real and it’s not going away. Embracing it offers a way to mobilise local investment while expanding access. Equities: Stocks for the People If real estate tokenisation is about broadening property ownership, tokenised equities are about making stock ownership more accessible and versatile. Equities (shares in companies) are already “fractional” in the sense that owning a tiny percentage of a large company is common. But historically, buying stocks required a brokerage account, compliance with local rules, and often a hefty sum of money to get started. In many emerging markets, stock market participation is very low – only a small fraction of the population invests in equities. Barriers include lack of awareness, limited disposable income, and sometimes a dearth of local companies that people feel connected to. Furthermore, if someone in Bangladesh wants to invest in a U.S. tech giant, the hurdles are enormous under traditional finance. Tokenisation can knock down these walls. By creating digital tokens that represent shares (or economic interests in shares) of a company, you can enable people to buy and trade those tokens globally, 24/7, with just a mobile app. Consider a young entrepreneur in Jakarta who idolizes big tech – maybe he can only spare $50, nowhere near enough to buy a full share at market price. But a token platform might offer a fractional token of that stock, so his $50 could get him a piece of a share. Multiply that by millions of aspiring investors and you have a recipe for much broader equity ownership. It’s essentially the “stocks for everyone” idea that some fintech brokers have popularised, now supercharged by blockchain. The technology angle also adds benefits beyond fractional share sizes. Blockchain‑based stock tokens could be traded instantly, 24/7 (no waiting for stock exchange hours) and settle immediately, rather than enduring the typical multi‑day settlement cycle. This always‑on market means investors in different time zones aren’t left behind. It also means that if there’s breaking news at night, you could react immediately instead of waiting for the exchange to open next morning. Enhanced liquidity and improved price discovery are just part of the package. For emerging market investors, such a system could be a lifeline during volatile periods – allowing quick adjustments in response to local or global financial shifts. Beyond global giants, tokenised equities could help local businesses and startups raise capital. Traditional stock exchanges in frontier markets often have few listings and strict requirements. But imagine a promising local company issuing security tokens to the public as an alternative to an IPO. This would let the community invest in a local business easily. Essentially, it’s equity crowdfunding 2.0 on blockchain. For instance, a farmer’s cooperative in Indonesia could tokenise shares in their processing plant; villagers could buy tokens and collectively fund a project that also gives them ownership stake. It blends community finance with modern tech. From a bank’s perspective, tokenised equities might trigger some caution – questions about investor protection, custody, and compliance are real. However, they also represent an opportunity. Banks can act as custodians or issuers for these tokens, bridging trust by holding the underlying stocks and issuing tokens to customers. This approach, if paired with sound regulatory oversight, could bring the benefits of digital-native experiences to a broader investor base while preserving the stability of traditional systems. Livestock: From Pastures to the Blockchain Ledger Imagine a pastoral scene where cows and goats, long cherished as markers of wealth and social standing, are transformed into digital assets – tradable on a blockchain as easily as shares of a company. In many emerging markets, livestock isn’t just an asset; it’s a way of life. It’s used for dowries, as collateral, or as a store of value. Yet livestock is an illiquid asset – you can’t easily sell 1/10th of a cow when you need cash. Enter tokenisation. Pilot projects have shown that tokenising livestock can be both practical and beneficial. In Latin America, an innovative venture launched a token to fractionalise the revenue stream of a cattle ranch, effectively selling shares in the ranch’s output. Investors worldwide could buy tokens representing a small stake in the ranch, sharing in the proceeds when cattle are sold, all without ever touching a cow. This model enables farmers to raise capital without liquidating their herd and allows small investors to access an asset class traditionally reserved for the wealthy. Over in Argentina, a project called BitCow has taken a bold step by backing each token with a real, live cow. When you buy a BitCow token, you effectively own a stake in an actual cow managed by a farming company. As the cow produces calves, token rewards are issued to token holders – much like receiving dividends in the form of additional tokens. In regions where livestock represents a significant economic and cultural asset, such innovations can make the difference between exclusion and empowerment. Now picture similar ideas applied in Africa or Asia. In Kenya or Tanzania, owning cattle is a sign of wealth. A platform could allow local farmers to tokenise parts of their herds, letting investors from around the world purchase tokens equivalent to, say, one goat or a fraction of a cow. Farmers get much‑needed cash flow while token holders gain a tradable, fractional asset. This system could also facilitate novel insurance or lending mechanisms – a farmer might pledge livestock tokens as collateral for a loan, rather than risking the sale of the actual animal. Such models extend traditional practices of shared community livestock ownership into the digital age. Tokenising livestock also introduces greater transparency and oversight in sectors often marred by opaque records. With each animal tokenised and its history recorded on blockchain, stakeholders can verify health records, pedigree, and performance. This can improve food safety and attract more investment into agriculture – a sector vital to many emerging economies. The View from the Regulator’s Saddle (and the Banker’s Desk) No discussion of financial innovation would be complete without touching on regulation and the role of incumbent institutions. It’s understandable that the idea of freely trading tokens representing cows, condos, or company shares might initially raise eyebrows among regulators and bankers. Questions abound: How do we ensure tokens aren’t misused? What legal rights do token holders have? And how do we manage taxation and investor protection? The good news is that regulators in many regions are engaging with these questions. Controlled regulatory sandboxes in countries like Kenya, Nigeria, Malaysia, and beyond are allowing fintech experiments under watchful eyes. This approach lets innovation proceed in a limited way to gather data, while containing risk. From a bank’s perspective, tokenisation isn’t a threat but an opportunity. Banks can partner with fintech companies to offer tokenised products, act as custodians, and even provide advisory services around digital assets. With proper frameworks and transparency, tokenisation can be integrated safely, unlocking new revenue streams and expanding financial inclusion. Embracing the Fractional Future In emerging markets, where the need for financial inclusion and efficient capital allocation is most acute, fractionalisation and tokenisation present a compelling way forward. We’ve seen how a single cow can be divided among many owners, or how a building can be owned by a thousand people. These aren’t just gimmicks – they reflect a future where finance is more inclusive, assets are more liquid, and innovation bridges cultural traditions with modern technology. For the everyday user, this means opportunity. Small investors can diversify and participate in economic growth like never before, whether it’s owning a bit of farmland in Latin America, a flat in an Asian metropolis, or a share of a thriving Nigerian business. For asset owners, it means new ways to unlock the value of what they hold without having to sell it all at once – transforming illiquid assets into spendable wealth incrementally. And for the broader economy, it means mobilising dormant capital into productive uses. There are, of course, challenges – technology risks, education gaps, and the need for robust trust frameworks. Yet emerging markets have a history of leapfrogging outdated systems, much like the success of mobile money in Africa. With the right approach, tokenisation and fractionalisation can do for asset ownership what mobile money did for financial inclusion. The future of finance might very well be fractional – a future where everyone, regardless of income or location, can own a piece of what builds our economy. And that’s a revolution worth embracing.

Title: Four in five workers in Ireland not aware of State’s auto-enrolment pension details

Four in five Irish workers are still not aware of the details of the incoming compulsory workplace pension regime just six months out from the launch date, according to a survey carried out by US investment giant BlackRock. BlackRock is understood to be among asset managers lining up a bid to manage part of the so-called auto-enrolment pension pot. The scheme will capture up to 800,000 workers between the ages of 23 and 60 and earning more than €20,000 who are not currently part of a pension plan, at the end of September. BlackRock’s 2025 Ireland Read on Retirement report also said that only 41 per cent of Irish workers feel they are on track for a reasonable standard of living on retirement. This falls to 26 per cent across individuals that do not have a defined contribution (DC) workplace pension. “As we approach the introduction of auto-enrolment in the Republic of Ireland it is crucial that we address the gaps in awareness and understanding to ensure that all workers can benefit from this pivotal step forward,” said Tim Hodgson, of BlackRock’s UK & Ireland DC Platforms and Retirement Solutions. “Irish workers face similar challenges to those encountered by retirement savers around the world. The introduction of auto-enrolment later this year is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to help individuals set themselves up for a comfortable retirement.” The Department of Social Protection launched a long-delayed official search for three companies to manage the investment of contributions that will be made by employers, employees and the State into the auto-enrolment pot. Each will have to provide fund options of low, medium and high risk. Investment managers interested in the business have until April 7th to pitch for it. BlackRock is expected to compete alongside Amundi, Irish Life’s investment management arm, State Street Global Advisors and others for one of the three contracts. The “request for tender” document says that there may be €21 billion in assets under management in the My Future Fund – the name given to the auto-enrolment scheme – within 10 years. The document, filed on the Government’s eTenders website, sets a cap on any all-inclusive annual management charge of 0.1 per cent of the assets under management. Under auto-enrolment employers and employees will both contribute 1.5 per cent of their gross earnings to it initially, with the State adding a further 0.5 per cent. The contributions of all parties will gradually increase, reaching 6 per cent and 2 per cent respectively by 2034. The BlackRock survey results reflect an international trend of poor retirement readiness. BlackRock’s UK Read on Retirement published in 2024 found that nearly three-quarters of UK DC pension savers feel they are not on track to achieve a reasonable standard of living in retirement while 60 per cent of workers who participated in a US study said they feared outliving their retirement savings.

Title: Institutions Embrace Bitcoin While The UK Falls Behind

BySusie Violet Ward BySusie Violet Ward Contributor. LONDON, ENGLAND - MAY 29: People pass through the Bank area of the City of London on May 29, 2024 in ... More London, England. In recent months, the UK's Chancellor of the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt has reportedly met with the boss of Shein, the Chinese-founded fashion retailer, to encourage the company to launch its initial public offering on the London Stock Exchange. London's reputation as a global financial hub has suffered in the wake of Brexit, compounded by an industry-wide slowdown in public offerings due to high interest rates and economic uncertainty. Photo by Carl Court The UK has a proud history of excellence and innovation in both financial services and in computer science. But its regulatory approach to bitcoin, which sits at the intersection between these disciplines, is undermining that position. The Financial Conduct Authority has created uncertainty, driven businesses offshore, and is damaging the UK’s competitiveness in digital finance. Regulatory uncertainty, restrictive policies, and a risk-averse approach have put the UK at a disadvantage as institutions elsewhere move forward. While other jurisdictions recognize Bitcoin’s role in institutional finance, UK regulators have created an environment that stifles progress. The Bitcoin for Institutions event, held recently in London at The Law Society, brought together investors, policymakers, and industry leaders to assess bitcoin’s growing significance. The consensus? The rest of the world is advancing while the UK remains stuck in bureaucratic inaction. Bitcoin for Institutions at The Law Society. Allen Farrington, co-founder of Axiom, a bitcoin-native investment firm focused on capital deployment in the bitcoin economy, captured the shift in institutional thinking. He described bitcoin as “forming the basis of a viable institutional asset class.” However, despite bitcoin being the best-performing asset of the decade, UK institutions remain hesitant. The FCA, tasked with ensuring financial stability, has instead become a barrier to innovation, and the result is that businesses have been driven out of the UK, driven out by regulatory hostility or simply deciding that the cost of compliance with poorly thought-out regulation is too high. While the UK stalls, the U.S. moves fast. One message was repeated throughout the event. Ignoring bitcoin is now seen as a career risk. https://x.com/Blockstream/status/1903109220393750840 In the U.S., pension funds, corporate treasuries, and asset managers are integrating bitcoin into their portfolios. In recent months, the largest buyers of bitcoin have not been retail investors or hedge funds, but institutional funds. Andrew Hohns, founder and CEO of Newmarket Investment Management, described the contrast, “Many U.S. companies have started incorporating bitcoin into their financial planning, and many others are well down the road. In the UK, institutional awareness of the benefits of bitcoin is more nascent, but the topic will move closer to center stage as corporate and sovereign game theory quickly take hold." Dominic Frisby summed up the cost of inaction: "Given the potential of bitcoin, and its record, the risk is not so much owning bitcoin as not owning it." In dialogue with Izabella Kaminska, Steve Baker, who served as Minister of State in the Cabinet Office until July 2024, commented on U.S. policymakers’ proactive stance, stating, “It’s great that the US is governed by a group of people who understand this.” In contrast, jurisdictions like the U.S., UAE, and Singapore are attracting capital by implementing frameworks that distinguish between bitcoin and speculative cryptoassets. The FCA has created a framework that treats bitcoin the same as speculative crypto tokens, ignoring its distinct characteristics as a decentralized monetary network. Adrian Cannon from Musqet pointed out this fundamental mismatch, "Bitcoin is revolutionary in ideas and concepts and that doesn’t fit within regulation and banking." Beyond the FCA’s misclassification of bitcoin, the UK’s broader regulatory structure is also a barrier to institutional adoption. Baroness Claire Fox, who sits in the House of Lords, told the audience about a recent government initiative called the Regulatory Innovation Office, which was implemented with the intention of reining in regulators. However, the reality is a system of self-replicating bureaucracy, as she described a quango of regulators where no one has accountability. This structure discourages innovation, shields regulators from scrutiny, and blocks new market entrants, creating a system that protects incumbents while deterring progress. While regulators insist their approach is about protecting investors, the reality is that businesses are being forced offshore, limiting choice and harming competitiveness. Beyond regulatory concerns, institutional adoption has also been slowed by misconceptions about bitcoin’s environmental impact. Discussions at the event highlighted how bitcoin is being used to stabilize energy grids, reduce waste, and improve sustainability. One panel on social benefits discussed bitcoin’s growing role in advancing financial inclusion and human rights - and the fintech products being built to enable this. In regions affected by financial repression, bitcoin is being used to bypass restrictions, support activist movements, and provide stable value transfer in fragile economies. In areas with poor access to banking, whether in sub-Saharan Africa, Afghanistan, or refugee communities, bitcoin offers a way to receive donations, store value, and operate independently from centralised financial institutions. LONDON, ENGLAND - MAY 30: In this photo illustration, a visual representation of Bitcoin in London, ... More England. Bitcoin is a decentralised digital currency, which has been in use since 2009. Photo illustration by Edward Smith Recent data indicates that over 50% of bitcoin mining is now powered by renewable energy sources. Miners are increasingly co-locating with wind, solar, and hydro projects, acting as flexible demand-response partners and absorbing excess energy when supply outpaces demand and powering down during peak consumption to relieve pressure on the grid. In the UK, this model could deliver substantial savings, especially given that electricity prices here are among the highest in the world. Reducing energy costs could offer a vital boost to both households and businesses facing mounting bills. According to the National Grid ESO, curtailment of wind power alone cost British consumers over £800 million in 2023, as renewable generators were paid to shut down during periods of oversupply, with the tab being picked up by households. If this curtailed energy were redirected to bitcoin mining, an approach already implemented in parts of the U.S., Scandinavia, and Africa, it would reduce these costs and provide an additional revenue stream for renewable operators. Instead of paying producers to switch off, excess energy could be monetised in real-time, and customers would see immediate savings on their bills. Bitcoin mining is also being used to capture vented methane from oil fields and repurpose landfill gas into electricity, turning environmental liabilities into economic opportunities. These developments challenge legacy thinking and position bitcoin as an energy solution. The discussion repeatedly returned to one key issue, namely that the UK is falling behind. While British firms continue debating whether bitcoin should be included in institutional portfolios, U.S. asset managers and corporate treasurers are already executing their bitcoin strategies. Dominic Frisby captured the financial risk of inaction, "The risk is not owning it." At the same time, institutional investors in the U.S. and elsewhere are increasing their exposure. In recent months, institutional funds have been the largest single buyer of bitcoin. This shift was largely due to BlackRock and Fidelity launching U.S.-approved bitcoin ETFs in early 2024, an institutional milestone that the UK has yet to match. What’s more, President Donald Trump signed an executive order in early March 2025 to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, positioning bitcoin as a strategic asset within the U.S. financial system. ​ The tension between legacy finance and emerging alternatives was clear throughout the event, which was described as a clash between Wall Street and Main Street. The real risk for the UK is not that bitcoin will fail but that it will succeed elsewhere and leave the UK institutions scrambling to catch up. If the UK wants to remain a serious player in global finance, it needs to adapt before the next wave of innovation settles elsewhere. Baroness Claire Fox offered a blunt assessment of the current state of affairs and the path to change, “Rebellion is the way forward.” The Bitcoin for Institutions event clearly demonstrated an unavoidable truth: that UK institutions must act. Regulatory paralysis is not stopping bitcoin’s adoption. It is simply pushing progress elsewhere. While the U.S., UAE, and Singapore create supportive policies, the UK remains locked in bureaucratic complexity. Without a course correction, UK financial firms will be left behind in the next phase of institutional finance. Bitcoin is no longer an emerging trend, it is a financial transformation already in motion. And transformations do not wait for governments and regulators to catch up. This event was held under Chatham House Rule. All participants quoted in this article gave permission for their remarks to be used.

Title: Sustainable investing the new standard

ESG investing is more than just a trend -- many expect it to become the new standard. The strategy is considered sustainable, measuring environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors to judge an investment's financial returns and impact. Environmental factors can include carbon emissions, waste management and sustainability efforts. Social factors involve employee treatment, workplace diversity and community relations. Governance factors value leadership decisions, transparency and business ethics. With growing investor interest and regulatory support, ESG investing is becoming a mainstream approach to building sustainable and profitable portfolios. Research suggests ESG-focused investments often outperform traditional ones, offering competitive returns with less risk. At the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET), ESG investment is being prioritised and support is provided to listed companies to align with international ESG standards. Many Thai listed companies received global ESG scores and emerged as industry leaders, recognised by S&P Global's Sustainability Yearbook 2025, which evaluates and awards companies for outperforming their peers in sustainability. GROWING POPULARITY Global ESG fund investments have been increasing, with assets under management now exceeding US$40 trillion, according to Bloomberg. Reports from Morningstar and MSCI indicate ESG funds tend to outperform conventional funds in the long term. During the pandemic, global ESG funds recovered more quickly than the overall market. Research from Harvard Business Review suggests ESG stocks exhibit lower volatility and offer stable returns during market downturns. Sustainable businesses are more likely to survive and grow in the long term due to improved risk management in ESG aspects, according to these reports. Governments are introducing regulations on net-zero policies, carbon taxes and ESG standards, affecting companies that fail to adapt. Companies reliant on fossil fuels or lacking ESG policies may face rising costs due to fines, environmental fees, and higher energy costs. Institutional investors such as BlackRock, Vanguard and Norges Bank emphasise ESG criteria and require companies they invest in to uphold clear sustainability standards. Recognising this trend, the SET supports Thai listed companies in enhancing sustainability. Soraphol Tulayasathien, senior executive vice-president and head of sustainable market development at the SET, said the bourse is driving ESG adoption among listed companies through various initiatives, including the development of the SET ESG Ratings and SET ESG Index. The SET utilises its ESG Ratings to compile the SET ESG Index, which has been published on the SET's website since Nov 6, 2023. The SET ESG Ratings are based on a voluntary sustainability assessment that evaluates companies across ESG dimensions. The assessment is reviewed annually to align with evolving sustainability trends at both global and national levels. To be included in the SET ESG Ratings, listed companies must score at least 50% in each ESG dimension and meet specific criteria, such as corporate governance reporting (CGR) quality, net profit performance, shareholder equity, and adherence to ESG-related compliance standards. Any companies failing to meet these criteria are excluded from the ratings. ESG IN THAILAND More than 100 Thai ESG funds manage some 30 billion baht in assets. Chavinda Hanratanakool, chairwoman of the Association of Investment Management Companies, said firms are encountering greater risks across the global business landscape. "ESG information will be an important tool investors should use to make investment decisions," she said. "Companies that take into account ESG issues can see their business risks reduced, while investors are also focusing on managing their risks." To serve the growing popularity of ESG investments and to prop up a struggling bourse, the government endorsed the Thai ESG Extra (ESG X) fund category last month, designed to encourage investment in sustainable and high-growth equities through substantial tax incentives. Investors can transfer existing holdings from long-term equity funds maturing this year, estimated at 180 billion baht, to Thai ESG X funds to qualify for a tax deduction of up to 500,000 baht. Investors can claim 300,000 baht in the 2025 tax year, with the remaining 200,000 baht available for deduction in subsequent years at 50,000 baht a year. New investments in Thai ESG X funds are also eligible for a separate tax deduction of 300,000 baht in the 2025 tax year, provided the units are purchased between May and June. The SET listed 242 stocks for inclusion in Thai ESG and Thai ESG X funds, consisting of 228 companies with SET ESG Ratings and 14 companies disclosing greenhouse gas emissions data. Whether other stocks can be included depends on the individual fund policies. The bourse announced Thai ESG X funds must invest at least 65% of net asset value in securities listed on the SET or Market for Alternative Investment that meet one of the three following sustainability criteria. First, securities that have a good SET ESG Rating or international ESG rating, such as from the FTSE Index or MSCI Index. Second, companies that disclosed greenhouse gas emissions data, and third companies that have a CGR score from the Thai Institute of Directors of at least 90 and disclosed data on at least 85% of their items on the SET ESG data platform. RATINGS BENEFITS Mr Soraphol said an ESG rating serves as a tool for improving sustainable business practices and risk management. Companies receive scores and recommendations in order to enhance their ESG performance, he said. ESG scores allow companies to compare their sustainability performance against peers, while companies gain visibility among sustainable investors, facilitating better access to capital, said Mr Soraphol. "An ESG credit rating benefits investors and analysts, providing a benchmark for comparing companies' ESG performance," he said. For analysts, the rating supports stock valuation and investment decision-making. In addition, the rating helps fund managers develop ESG-focused investment products, said Mr Soraphol. The rating also serves as a tool for investor engagement and corporate ESG advocacy, he said. In 2024, 228 listed companies clinched a spot on the SET ESG Ratings, echoing the growing wave of sustainable investments locally and globally. There are 242 listed companies on the list. GLOBAL LEADERSHIP S&P Global recently launched the Sustainability Yearbook 2025 to recognise top-performing companies in sustainability. The assessment is based on the 2024 S&P Global Corporate Sustainability Assessment (CSA), which evaluated 7,690 companies on economic and ESG factors. S&P global CSA scores range from 0 to 100 and categorise companies into the top 1%, top 5%, and top 10% globally: The top 1% comprises companies with the highest CSA scores worldwide. The top 5% covers companies ranking just below the top 1%. The top 10% comprises the highest-ranked 10% of companies in each industry. Beyond ESG stocks, investment themes such as climate change, green bonds and carbon credits are gaining traction. The SET partnered with the London Stock Exchange Group through FTSE Russell to enhance ESG assessments in Thailand, aligning SET ESG Ratings with global standards. The assessment methodology, which is used for more than 8,000 securities worldwide, ensures Thai listed firms can be benchmarked against global peers, strengthening investor confidence. A pilot assessment is planned for 2024-2025, with full public ESG score disclosure by 2026. NET-ZERO COMMITMENTS As the SET enters its 50th year, the bourse is driving sustainable capital market development and aiming for net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. As part of these efforts, it is developing the SET Carbon system to disclose climate change management data about the capital market, aiming to enhance climate data disclosure and streamline corporate greenhouse gas emissions reporting. The first phase of SET Carbon is available to interested companies in the first quarter of this year. In collaboration with the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand, the bourse is also integrating listed companies' energy consumption data. The SET recently obtained validation for its net-zero targets from the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), an internationally recognised authority on science-based target setting. The validated targets include a 42% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and a 90% reduction by 2050. With this distinction, the bourse becomes the fourth stock exchange worldwide to secure SBTi validation for both near-term and long-term net-zero targets, alongside Bursa Malaysia, the Nasdaq and Deutsche Börse Group. "ESG investing is more than just an option, it is the new global investment standard," said Mr Soraphol. Investors prioritising ESG will unlock superior opportunities, while companies committed to sustainability will attract greater investor attention and achieve long-term growth potential, he said.

Crypto users are backing a spot XRP ETF approval on Polymarket as odds soar past 85%. Anticipation for altcoin ETFs has dominated the market since Donald Trump’s election victory in November 2024. With US regulatory waters easing, most users have called for possible XRP, SOL, and ADA spot ETFs. On March 24, the odds for a spot XRP ETF in the United States soared past 85% on Polymarket. The prediction platform recently gained traction regarding U.S. policies, including the last Presidential election. Users expect the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to give applications the regulatory nod this year following recent events in the market. This became a major morale boost for traders due to the high chances of Polymarket predictions. A previous Dune Analytics study showed that the betting market had a 90% success rate. At press time, the prediction volume has soared past $55,000, while 42% of users back an earlier approval date of July 31. Similarly, digital asset enthusiast Nate Geraci wrote on X that a spot XRP ETF approval is just a matter of time, citing participation from BlackRock, Fidelity, and other firms. He added that the asset is the third largest by market cap, hinting that these top firms would not miss out on it. Several crypto users have toed the same line, stressing that the asset’s market cap and institutional demand place it next in line for approval. In Q4 2024, XRP flipped USDT to become the third-largest asset by market cap after it soared above $3. Institutional investors also increased their exposure to the asset following global partnerships coupled with its cross-border functionalities. At the time of writing, XRP gained 0.5% to trade at $2.14 in the past few hours. Aside from wider institutional adoption, the present regulatory environment in the United States has triggered a new wave of optimism. Last week, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse revealed that the SEC would drop its appeal against the firm after years of litigation. For most commentators, the Ripple v SEC lawsuit remained a setback for the firm in terms of institutional demand. Furthermore, the launch of a strategic crypto reserve in the United States and growing acceptance from traditional firms have heightened investor appetite.

Title: Shiba Inu Insider Explains Why SHIB Is Ready For Multi-Billion-Dollar Inflows From ‘SHIB ETFs’

The debate over whether Shiba Inu (SHIB) is ready for an exchange-traded fund (ETF) continues to gain traction in the crypto space. Despite ranking as the 17th largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization and boasting over 110 exchange listings with 212 trading pairs, SHIB has yet to receive a proposed ETF in the United States. However, its community remains steadfast in pushing for recognition. On Sunday, Lucie, the lead marketing strategist for Shiba Inu, took to X to highlight SHIB’s readiness for an ETF and why even boomers could embrace the popular meme token. “SHIB is listed on over 110 exchanges with 212 trading pairs—including all the major platforms. It’s basically everywhere: easy to access, easy to trade. Is SHIB good for an ETF? YES. Will boomers invest in a ‘doggy coin’? Also yes,” Lucie asserted. She emphasized that SHIB is more than just a meme; it is a decentralized, community-driven asset built to last. One of the strongest arguments for a SHIB ETF is its resistance to price manipulation. The pundit pointed out that to manipulate SHIB, one would need to be a billionaire, similar to Bitcoin. This characteristic differentiates SHIB from low-cap tokens susceptible to extreme price swings. Additionally, she highlighted SHIB’s decentralization as a critical factor in its ETF potential. Unlike projects that rely on central entities, SHIB continues to grow organically, with various teams building around it. She referenced Shiba Inu’s ecosystem, including the core development team, Shibarium’s Layer-2 blockchain, and the ShibaSwap decentralized exchange, as key innovations that bolster SHIB’s long-term sustainability. This is not the first time the Shiba Inu community has advocated for an ETF. In January 2025, Shibizens, a prominent SHIB community handle, published a detailed case for why major asset managers like BlackRock and Grayscale should consider launching a SHIB ETF. Their argument rested on ten key points, including SHIB’s massive global community, high liquidity, and operational success of Shibarium. The post quickly gained traction, with community members rallying behind the idea. Users voiced strong support and predicted a price surge for SHIB ecosystem tokens, such as BONE, SHIB, and LEASH. Shibizens also highlighted SHIB’s affordability, ESG-friendly initiatives through the Shib Karma Foundation, and potential for long-term institutional adoption. One of Lucie’s more interesting claims was that boomers could warm up to SHIB. While traditionally wary of volatile assets, older investors could find SHIB appealing due to its accessibility, decentralization, and expanding role in DeFi, gaming, and payments. Additionally, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently clarified on February 27, 2025, that most meme coins do not qualify as securities under federal law. This shift strengthens SHIB’s prospects for an ETF, potentially making it easier for older investors to enter the meme coin market.

Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence (AI) company has acquired his social media platform in a multibillion-dollar deal. The deal, announced by Musk Friday (March 28), values his xAI at $80 billion and X, the social media platform once known as Twitter, at $33 billion ($45 billion minus $12 billion in debt). “xAI and X’s futures are intertwined,” Musk wrote in a post on the social media site. “Today, we officially take the step to combine the data, models, compute, distribution and talent. This combination will unlock immense potential by blending xAI’s advanced AI capability and expertise with X’s massive reach.” According to Musk, X now has 600 million active users. Data from those users has been used to train Grok, xAI’s artificial intelligence model. And premium subscribers to X can access some of Grok’s higher-end features. The news follows reports from last month that X was in talks to raise funds from investors at a $44 billion valuation, the same figure Musk paid for the platform in 2022. An investor in X told the Financial Times (FT) that getting back to the original purchase price has been a symbolic target for Musk. As that report noted, Musk loosened X’s moderation policies after taking over. That prompted an advertiser exodus, driving down revenues. Fidelity Investments, the report points out, has slashed the company’s value, saying in late September it was under $10 billion. However, many advertisers have returned, with Amazon recently increasing its spending as Musk forged stronger ties with the White House. Investors told the FT that X’s finances seem to be improving, with the company having posted $1.2 billion in adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization last year. That figure aligns more or less with the time just before Musk acquired Twitter, the report added, though one source said the number was subject to “significant adjustments.” Meanwhile, xAI and chipmaker Nvidia recently joined the $30 billion AI Infrastructure Fund, an AI infrastructure project backed by BlackRock, Microsoft and Abu Dhabi AI investment group MGX, with the goal of raising up to $100 billion for the technology. “The global buildout of AI infrastructure will benefit every company and country that wants to achieve economic growth and unlock solutions to the world’s greatest challenges,” Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of Nvidia, said in the announcement. “AI factories built on Nvidia full-stack AI infrastructure will convert data into intelligence that will accelerate every industry and help society achieve unimaginable breakthroughs.” Elon Musk's X and xAI 'Intertwined' in $45 Billion Deal Frank Founder Charlie Javice Convicted of $175 Million Fraud Experience Economy Meets Hollywood: Live Events Redefine Movie, Streaming Engagement Lululemon Offers New Products and Events to Draw ‘Cautious Consumer’ We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

Title: Cork Con seal their place as Division 1A play-off contenders with win over Ballynahinch

The make-up of the Division 1A play-off contenders has been decided with a round to spare after results contrived to ensure St Mary’s, Clontarf, Cork Constitution and Lansdowne will contest the semi-finals. Cork Con sealed their place thanks to a 28-5 win in a tough, hard encounter at Ballynahinch which ended the home side’s play-off hopes. Con had first use of a swirling wind and led 14-5 at half time thanks to tries by lock Eoin Quilter and tight head Luke Masters. Entering the final quarter, scrumhalf Adam Maher rewarded sustained pressure, and a try five minutes from time by the Ireland Clubs captain Jack Kelleher sealed a bonus point. That also sealed a play-off place ahead of next Saturday’s concluding game at home to Terenure, who suffered a fourth defeat in a row at home by 20-12 to Young Munster. A try by Evan O’Connell gave “Munsters” a 7-5 lead at half time after playing into the wind, and two second half-tries by another Munster player, Shay McCarthy, secured the win. St Mary’s ensured their semi-final place with a 40-12 win at home to City of Armagh and unexpectedly went top by dint of Garryowen’s gritty 19-18 win at home to Clontarf. Gordon Wood scored tries in either half as the Light Blues recovered from a 13-7 deficit to win through a Mikey Veale try converted by Dylan Hicks. Despite this Garryowen’s relegation was mathematically confirmed. Clontarf now need to beat St Mary’s at home next Saturday to ensure a home semi-final or else they could be overtaken by Cork Con. UCD remain two points adrift of City of Armagh in the relegation play-off place after their 25-7 loss at home to in-form Lansdowne, and have the tougher last game away to Young Munster, whereas Armagh host Ballynahinch. Nenagh Ormond sealed a home semi-final in the 1B play-offs with 21-17 win over third-placed Blackrock, who next host fourth-placed Old Wesley, while UCC could overtake the losers at home to champions Old Belvedere. Shannon’s 1B status hangs by a thread after their 34-5 loss to Old Wesley. The nine-time champions sit tenth and last, and trail Highfield and Trinity by five points ahead of next Saturday’s last round when Shannon host Queen’s, Highfield go to Naas and Trinity entertain Nenagh. Greystones overtook Corinthians on points difference in the final 2A play-off place by dint of beating the Galway side 45-15 at home. Wanderers secured the 2B title and promotion with a 42-7 home win over Clogher Valley, while Midleton will take a two-point lead into the final round ahead of Enniscorthy atop 2C.

Title: Ireland secure record-breaking eight-try victory over Italy
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/rugby/2025/03/30/ireland-secure-record-breaking-eight-try-victory-over-italy/

A superb win and a great performance underscored by eight tries, there was plenty to celebrate for Scott Bemand’s team as they bounced back from their opening day defeat to France with an impressive victory in Parma. Ireland’s Aoife Dalton was a deserved player of the match, not only a try scorer, but also consistently excellent on both sides of the ball, making 15 tackles and nine carries. Although Ireland’s right wing Anna McGann might feel it’s not often that a hat-trick of tries is overlooked in handing out the laurels. There were others too that stood out. Stacey Flood added value every time she touched the ball, Eve Higgins had an eye for a gap, and outhalf Dannah O’Brien’s kicked brilliantly out of hand and off the tee, from which she landed seven from eight conversions. Up front the pack were excellent to a player, Aoife Wafer, Erin King and Linda Djougang especially prominent. Italy got off to the worst possible start as they lost their secondrow Valeria Fedrighi to a yellow card for a shoulder to the head of Ireland captain Edel McMahon after less than a minute. The subsequent bunker review adjudicated it should remain a yellow, but by the time she returned the home side had conceded 14 points. O’Brien kicked the penalty to touch. Ireland mauled the ball and after a couple of carries from the pack, pursued a wider option. Despite the fact that Higgins had her pass deflected, Dalton scooped up the ball and demonstrated speed and strength to force her way over. O’Brien’s conversion was unerring. It got even better for Ireland on seven minutes when Higgins deceived the defence with a dummy and accelerated through a gap. Both the timing and accuracy of her pass enabled Anna McGann to cross for her first try in Test rugby. The work of the Irish backrow at the breakdown was first class in the opening quarter, Wafer and King especially prominent, so too hooker Neve Jones. The Italians had served notice with some enterprising back play before scrumhalf Sofia Stefan profited from soft Irish defence to scamper over for a try. Ireland’s determination to drift without closing the space inside was costly. The visitors then dodged one or two more defensive lapses without conceding further points before Higgins, once again, cut the Italian defence asunder. Amee-Leigh Costigan still had work to do but accomplished it with a lovely in-and-out swerve to cross for Ireland’s third try. The fourth and bonus-point try was a brilliant team effort. Wafer and Djougang were direct and powerful to guarantee front foot possession, before fullback Stacey Flood glided on to the ball, straightened, and gave McGann the space to squeeze over in the corner for her second try. O’Brien kicked a superb touchline conversion, her fourth from as many attempts. A gutsy goal-line stand in the final moments of the half enabled Ireland to take a 28-5 interval lead. Wafer had a try disallowed soon after the restart Niamh O’Dowd pinged for blocking. Britanny Hogan and Dorothy Wall made an immediate impression off the bench, their energy and power conspicuous in the build-up to a deserved try for the hard-working Djougang. Unfortunately for the Irish tighthead prop her next involvement resulted in a yellow card, which stayed at that level of censure on review. It meant that Christy Haney had to come on for flanker McMahon. Hogan and Wall collaborated for Ireland’s sixth try on 64-minutes, the latter powering over from close range. O’Brien failed to convert for the first time. Italian centre Beatrice Rigoni was awarded a try after a TMO review, a strange decision on the basis that she didn’t get to her feet before playing the ball for a second time. Her right knee remained on the ground/back of the Irish player. She maximised her good fortune by adding the conversion, but it was merely window dressing in scoreboard terms. Given a glut of changes on both sides the contest lost a little of its shape as the teams struggled to maintain cohesion. Replacement scrumhalf Emily Lane might have added to Ireland’s tally, but lost control of the ball just shy of the Italian line following a sharp break. The visitors did get that seventh try, Hogan barging past a couple of lacklustre tackles, which O’Brien improved upon and with the last play of the match McGann grabbed her hat-trick, outflanking and outpacing the Italian defence. O’Brien’s conversion a fitting epitaph for a stellar placekicking display.

Title: How Performative Activism Enabled Mass Persecution

Skip to comments. Posted on 03/30/2025 9:23:17 AM PDT by MtnClimber Reality engineering requires three components: institutional power to create the narrative, social pressure to enforce it, and the deliberate persecution of anyone who challenges either. The Covid era provided the perfect case study in how this machinery operates—and revealed how performative activism serves as its most potent enforcement mechanism. Every major element of the official Covid narrative has been proven false: The origins of the virus, the validity of PCR tests, the suppression of early treatments, the denial of natural immunity, the so-called “safety and effectiveness” of vaccines, and the utility of masks, lockdowns, and vaccine passports. Yet those who questioned any part of it faced unprecedented ostracism and persecution. The manufactured panic ignored fundamental reality: Covid posed minimal risk to healthy people under 70, but was significantly more dangerous to the elderly and immunocompromised. Rather than focusing resources on protecting vulnerable populations, we destroyed economies, stole childhoods, and enforced measures that made no epidemiological sense. This wasn’t just about control—it was an engineered economic coup, the largest financial consolidation of power in modern history. While small businesses were forcibly closed, Amazon’s profits soared. As working-class neighborhoods struggled, Wall Street celebrated record gains. The laptop class posted about ‘we’re all in this together’ from their home offices while essential workers were forced into what was portrayed as dangerous conditions to deliver their groceries. The same corporations trumpeting their commitment to “equity” through DEI initiatives were destroying economic mobility for the very communities they claimed to champion. Just months before Covid, the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security in partnership with the World Economic Forum and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation hosted Event 201, a high-level pandemic exercise on October 18, 2019, in New York, NY. An examination of the event reveals that the priority of the exercise centered not on treatment protocols or protecting the vulnerable but rather on how information control could be used to manufacture mass compliance. When the real crisis arrived, this strategy found willing accomplices in a culture already primed for performative virtue. The height of this hypocrisy revealed itself during the pandemic, exposing not just empty virtue signaling, but active participation in one of the most egregious civil rights violations in recent American history. As millions changed their profile pictures and posted solidarity symbols for social justice, these same voices fell silent—or worse, actively participated in the persecution of two distinct groups: the unvaccinated and the vaccine-injured. The Profitable Performance of PowerThe economic devastation fell hardest on those least able to bear it. While professionals attended Zoom meetings in their pajamas, service workers faced an impossible choice: show up to what was marketed as a deadly environment or lose their livelihoods. The data tells the story: - Black-owned businesses declined by 41% during the first few months of lockdowns - Latino unemployment reached 18.9%, the highest of any demographic - Women left the workforce in unprecedented numbers, erasing decades of gains - Small businesses, the primary path to middle-class stability in minority communities, closed at triple the rate of their corporate competitors The financial beneficiaries were clear: - Amazon’s market value increased by $570 billion - Zoom’s stock rose 396% - Moderna executives became billionaires overnight - Pfizer reported record profits of $100 billion - BlackRock acquired 34% of single-family homes in major markets During the lockdown, ostensibly put in place to “protect the vulnerable”, vulnerable small businesses lost $4.6 trillion in value, with minority-owned enterprises accounting for 41% of closures despite representing only 20% of total businesses. This wasn’t just hypocrisy—it was a calculated consolidation of power under the guise of public health....SNIP TOPICS: Society KEYWORDS: leftism Click here: to donate by Credit Card Or here: to donate by PayPal Or by mail to: Free Republic, LLC - PO Box 9771 - Fresno, CA 93794 Thank you very much and God bless you. 1 posted on 03/30/2025 9:23:17 AM PDT by MtnClimber [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: MtnClimber Some conspiracy theories turn out to be true. 2 posted on 03/30/2025 9:23:35 AM PDT by MtnClimber (For photos of scenery, wildlife and climbing, click on my screen name for my FR home page.)

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Every major element of the official Covid narrative has been proven false: The origins of the virus, the validity of PCR tests, the suppression of early treatments, the denial of natural immunity, the so-called “safety and effectiveness” of vaccines, and the utility of masks, lockdowns, and vaccine passports. Yet those who questioned any part of it faced unprecedented ostracism and persecution. The manufactured panic ignored fundamental reality: Covid posed minimal risk to healthy people under 70, but was significantly more dangerous to the elderly and immunocompromised. Rather than focusing resources on protecting vulnerable populations, we destroyed economies, stole childhoods, and enforced measures that made no epidemiological sense. This wasn’t just about control—it was an engineered economic coup, the largest financial consolidation of power in modern history. While small businesses were forcibly closed, Amazon’s profits soared. As working-class neighborhoods struggled, Wall Street celebrated record gains. The laptop class posted about ‘we’re all in this together’ from their home offices while essential workers were forced into what was portrayed as dangerous conditions to deliver their groceries. The same corporations trumpeting their commitment to “equity” through DEI initiatives were destroying economic mobility for the very communities they claimed to champion. Just months before Covid, the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security in partnership with the World Economic Forum and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation hosted Event 201, a high-level pandemic exercise on October 18, 2019, in New York, NY. An examination of the event reveals that the priority of the exercise centered not on treatment protocols or protecting the vulnerable but rather on how information control could be used to manufacture mass compliance. When the real crisis arrived, this strategy found willing accomplices in a culture already primed for performative virtue. The height of this hypocrisy revealed itself during the pandemic, exposing not just empty virtue signaling, but active participation in one of the most egregious civil rights violations in recent American history. As millions changed their profile pictures and posted solidarity symbols for social justice, these same voices fell silent—or worse, actively participated in the persecution of two distinct groups: the unvaccinated and the vaccine-injured. The Profitable Performance of PowerThe economic devastation fell hardest on those least able to bear it. While professionals attended Zoom meetings in their pajamas, service workers faced an impossible choice: show up to what was marketed as a deadly environment or lose their livelihoods. The data tells the story: - Black-owned businesses declined by 41% during the first few months of lockdowns - Latino unemployment reached 18.9%, the highest of any demographic - Women left the workforce in unprecedented numbers, erasing decades of gains - Small businesses, the primary path to middle-class stability in minority communities, closed at triple the rate of their corporate competitors The financial beneficiaries were clear: - Amazon’s market value increased by $570 billion - Zoom’s stock rose 396% - Moderna executives became billionaires overnight - Pfizer reported record profits of $100 billion - BlackRock acquired 34% of single-family homes in major markets During the lockdown, ostensibly put in place to “protect the vulnerable”, vulnerable small businesses lost $4.6 trillion in value, with minority-owned enterprises accounting for 41% of closures despite representing only 20% of total businesses.

Karen Heffernan wouldn’t know the father of her child if he passed her on the street. What she does know is what he looked like as a baby, his height, that he is Danish, and has a clean bill of health. That’s because when Heffernan, a 37-year-old hairdresser from Blackrock in Co Dublin was in her early 30s, she began to explore the idea of intrauterine insemination (IUI), using donor sperm. “I always knew I wanted a child, but my last long-term relationship ended when I was 25. I told myself, if I didn’t meet anyone I would be happy to have a child by myself, and then I hit 30 and gave myself two years to look into the option of using a donor properly. But then Covid hit,” she recalls. “That put a stop to socialising and going on dates. When restrictions were lifted I was around 34 and all my friends were having kids at the same time and I was like ‘what am I waiting for?‘” Before she went for the first consultation at a fertility clinic to discuss her options, Heffernan sat her parents Paula and Alan down to explain her plans. “I knew that taking this on as a single mother would require support. From the outset, they were 100 per cent behind my decision and my mum came with me for my first consultation,” she says. At a new Thérapie Fertility Clinic in Carrickmines, Heffernan was told of her options. Learning about women’s fertility and how rapidly it starts to decrease in their 30s, she knew she would be taking a chance on the donor route. She purchased three “straws” – three IUI rounds with the donor’s sperm, at a total cost of around €5,000. Under the Children, Family and Relationships Act (CFRA) 2015, which commenced in Ireland in May 2020, all imported donations – sperm or eggs – must be from a non-anonymous, or traceable, donor. Donors must agree to open contact with a donor-conceived child once that child reaches 18 years of age. “The donor was listed under the European Sperm Bank. In Ireland, there’s a lot of rules and regulations, so only three women in Ireland can use the same donor, and we can only use what is termed ‘open donors’, who can be contacted at a later stage by the child,” Heffernan explains. “I was only looking for a healthy, happy baby so that meant a donor [with] no health issues. It didn’t matter if they had brown or blonde hair, or [were] a boy or a girl.” [ The meaning of motherhood in a world that devalues, judges and polices itOpens in new window ] When her first attempt with IUI failed, Heffernan decided to go for a second round, but this time she kept what she was doing under wraps. In October 2022, she found out she was pregnant. “I live alone so I was sitting in my house in shock and happy-crying. I couldn’t believe it had happened for me so quickly. I hadn’t told my parents that I had gone for the second round It was my mum’s birthday on the day I was getting the blood tests to confirm my pregnancy, so I wrote on the card ‘Love from baby H’,” she adds. “When I told people I was pregnant, some would ask if I was going to say how it happened. My reaction was always, of course I will, because getting pregnant from a donor is nothing to be ashamed of.” In June 2023, her daughter was born. Heffernan sees her own family in the looks and traits of her child, now 21 months old, but has noticed some characteristics that are probably from the donor. “She’s quite a tall baby. Her skin is more sallow than mine too, but she looks like my family and she’s quite active in the way I was at her age.” Aimee Crinion wasn’t thinking about having children when she married her partner Dave in 2009. Then aged 32, and with both of them working full-time – she as a professional dog walker and he in IT – there was plenty of time to start a family, but first they would travel, enjoy plenty of nights out and long lie-ins. When the couple from Glasnevin in Dublin 9 decided to have children, they expected it to happen naturally. Except it didn’t. At 36, Crinion shared her concerns with her doctor and the couple subsequently opted for in vitro fertilisation (IVF) to try to help them to conceive. Crinion knew there were no guarantees. I knew I didn’t have it in me to go through IVF in my 40s. We had looked into adoption but we realised we were also too old for that “We went for one round at the Merrion Fertility Clinic in Dublin 2, and in our minds we were thinking, we’ll do it once. We were baffled why I couldn’t get pregnant. We were both healthy and neither of us had fertility problems – I simply wasn’t getting pregnant naturally, even with an egg reserve that wasn’t bad for my age,” she explains. “We did our first round of IVF against a background of people telling us that it never works the first time, which I thought was really pointless advice. But they were right, it didn’t work and I was desperately upset because all of my friends were married and had children or were pregnant and it consumed me – all I could see were babies everywhere. And that was all I wanted, to bring a child into the world.” Crinion credits the strength of her marriage as the reason for getting through the first failed round. Dave was a constant support and they had each other at the end of it all. [ ‘When our last embryo failed, the clinic told us there was nothing more they could do for us’Opens in new window ] Crinion’s father Michael became very ill during the same period, and died in October 2013. It was an incredibly stressful time. “I found it so hard to lose him and not have been able to let him meet my kids because I always believed he would,” she says. In 2014, the couple decided to go for one last round of IVF. “I knew I didn’t have it in me to go through IVF in my 40s. We had looked into adoption but we realised we were also too old for that. I remember that day in May in the Merrion Clinic and one of the nurses there turned to me and said ‘this is going to work, you’ve done everything you can and I’m telling you, this is going to work’. She mentioned my dad, just a passing comment, and something felt different, almost like he was watching over me.” Having never done a pregnancy test herself for the fear of disappointment, one morning just after a blood test at the clinic while out walking her dogs, she took their call. “I was on Killiney Hill with six dogs running around me and all the clinic said at the other end of the phone was ‘yes’. I started screaming, ‘Finally, finally’. Me and all these dogs [were] running towards the car park to get to my van. It was magical,” she says. Her son Hugo was born in February 2015. Content with her life, Crinion still had the option to pursue IVF, but didn’t know if she could go through the process again. Two years after her son was born, she went to the doctor with a urinary tract infection (UTI). “I gave the doctor a sample for the UTI test and she said, ‘Do you know you’re pregnant?’ I couldn’t process that. I remember saying something like ‘Okay ... but can you give me something for the UTI’ and then very quickly adding that I couldn’t be pregnant because I couldn’t have children naturally.” Arabella was born in November 2017, and there was no question of IVF again. “I do consider myself lucky. I’m 50 now with two beautiful children, a husband, a dog, and a lot of grey hair. As difficult as that path was to get here, I am very grateful for it all. I do believe my father has watched over every step.” Having raised three birth children of her own, Mags Murphy from Enniscorthy in Co Wexford is now a foster mother. Since 2018, she and her husband Danny, who also have three grandchildren, have taken in 10 foster children over short and long-term periods, with ongoing check-ins with Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, and support from Foster Care Ireland (FCI), an organisation that places children with foster parents. There were 5,595 children in the care of the State last year, according to Tusla, with 91 per cent of those children in foster homes. For Murphy, these figures are heartbreaking. “All of these children deserve a parent, or a caring adult that can make a difference. They have done nothing wrong, and yet many carry this feeling of guilt that it was something they did,” says the 57-year-old. “Even when they come into care, the children try so hard to please. They ask, ‘am I being good?’ and you’re thinking, ‘you are a child of four or five, you shouldn’t be worrying about having to be good or trying to figure out what is expected of you from adults.’ It’s very, very hard on them.” Murphy says her house has always been a lively, loud, and busy home. Her children – now 31, 35, and 37 – often had friends over. For 30 years, she ran her own childcare business for preschoolers, and over a 10-year period had 12 children from Belarus stay at Christmas or during the summer months under the Chernobyl Children’s Project International, founded by Adi Roche. When they call you mam it’s lovely but also sort of bittersweet, because you feel a sense of loss for them A self-confessed nurturer, it was after her children left home that she and Danny began to discuss fostering. Following assessments, vetting and training, they were accepted, and in April 2018 got their first placement under the “respite fostering” programme, where a child already with foster parents would come for a weekend or a week to give them and their foster parents a break. “At first it was like I was a doting granny because I would take this little child in on a Friday and they would return to a foster parent on the Monday, and you could really have fun with them and take them places. You didn’t have to deal with homework or the stress of school and all that goes with full foster care,” says Murphy. [ Fostering: ‘The children’s situation is so precarious – while we may not have everything to offer, we offer everything we have’Opens in new window ] “You would also see their behaviours and ask yourself if you could deal with that on a daily basis. But then we got our first boy and he was with us for four years. He was really lucky because he was reunited with his mum. It was a happy story. That often doesn’t happen for children in foster care.” It has been a challenging experience at times, too, but FCI’s link workers have offered a lot of support to the Murphys over the years. Murphy has maintained contact with many of the children who stayed with her, and has framed photographs of them all on the wall in her home. Some of the children have referred to her and Danny as “Mam and Dad” when speaking about their new family in school or with friends. “When they call you Mam it’s lovely but also sort of bittersweet, because you feel a sense of loss for them,” Murphy says. “You also want them to become comfortable and confident enough to just be children.” © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

[If] you want to go home, or you want to go back to Honduras, or maybe you don’t want to go back to Honduras because it’s too dangerous. [Or] you don’t want to go to Guatemala, but maybe you want to go to Costa Rica, and so they’re offering these [smuggling] packages where you can just go back home. Not all of them are taking it, I mean, many [are]. If migrants are deported by the United States government, they are separated from their families and detained in crowded jails, sometimes for many weeks. Once legally deported, migrants cannot visit for 10 years or longer, even when their relatives remain in the United States. They also lose possessions and easy access to their bank accounts. Haitians “are self-deporting right now because they don’t want the worst thing … because [the government] does send them back to Haiti immediately,” Jeff Lamour, an American businessman in Albertville, Alabama, told Breitbart News on Friday. Many Haitians have moved to Albertville for jobs once held by Americans in the chicken slaughterhouses. They got work permits from Biden’s deputies but are now losing them to Trump’s pro-American policies. Lamour added: This [self-deporting] industry with the coyotes, it has become a multi-million dollar industry over here now. You got those guys that are going from Indiana, from Alabama, in those vans where they’re smuggling people to New Mexico, to border states. They’re making a ton of money. If they go deposit money at the bank, it’s going to raise a red flag. You know, I had a gentleman a couple days ago trying to buy a car with cash, straight cash. He just don’t know what to do with it because he has a lot of cash from the shuttle industry. Smugglers “charge them $10,000 per head because a lot of people that are working are saving their money,” Lamour told told 1819News.com. “A lot of people are going back to Chile,” where they were living before Biden opened the border. Other Haitians are going into hiding, for example, by selling their cars to minimize the chance of any interaction with local police, he said: I sell cars for a living. I have my mechanic sitting next to me right there. He can tell you, as my witness — did we not have a guy come over here, return his car, because he’s scared to be deported? I had guys selling their car for $500 just so they won’t be deported. We see that every day. One local migrant “crossed from Brazil all the way to the United States,” Lamour told Breitbart News, adding: His wife and kids died in the [Darien Gap], and he had to leave them behind because he had to survive and save himself. Once he arrived in Mexico, he had to literally stay at the gay bathhouse [to avoid robbers, before he] made it over here through a Catholic charity. So far, the exit numbers are small compared to the resident population of roughly 18 million illegal migrants, of whom roughly 9 million were invited by President Joe Biden’s deputies. The New York Times acknowledged the trend: Since arriving in Denver in 2023, Cristian, 29, has delivered meals and worked on construction sites. (Like other migrants I interviewed, he worried that immigration agents would find him and spoke on the condition that I identify him only by his given name.) He sends money to his wife and children in Venezuela. Cristian does not have any tattoos, a customary gang indicator, he said. He possesses a work permit and an active asylum application, which theoretically protects him from imminent deportation. But the enforcement climate since Trump took office has changed Cristian’s calculus “360 degrees,” he told me. With the help of an American friend who escorted him to several immigration offices, he made an appointment to appear before a judge today so he could request a voluntary departure from the United States. (Immigrants who receive formal permission to leave have an easier time returning later.) … A family in Chicago recently left for Mexico, according to their lawyer. People have abandoned Springfield, Ohio — the town where Trump claimed Haitians were eating their pets — employers there told me. Others are contemplating leaving from elsewhere, like Houston. South of the border, northbound migrants are also turning back homewards. “It is true that people are going different directions,” Caleb Vitello, a senior official in Trump’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, told the Council on Foreign Relations. For example, the northward foot and boat traffic in the dangerous Darien Gap between Colombia and Panama has dropped “because people aren’t risking that walk or that dangerous journey through there,” he said. The migrants’ exit is bad news for business groups who want more imported customers, workers, and renters to increase their profits and stock values. “The only way that we continue to grow economically is actually by increasing our levels of immigration,” said Andrea Flores, the vice-president for lobbying at FWD.us, a lobby group for West Coast investors in the consumer economy. Flores told the CFR event: I think some of the inquiries I get most around the country are not from the border [area] and not from major urban areas. It’s from places like Nebraska [where] I routinely will get outreach from, saying, “How do we push for getting us elder care workers, childcare workers? How do we get some restaurant workers to revitalize some of our small towns? … So I’m very pro [asking] “Why don’t we offer, you know, English language courses? Why does the federal government provide that? How do you help facilitate a new immigrant’s arrival so they don’t create the type of social challenges [for] any country facing increased immigration?” But the promise of cheap labor is “a drug that too many American firms got addicted to … [and] globalization’s hunger for cheap labor is a problem precisely because it’s been bad for innovation,” Vice President JD Vance told an audience of investors in mid-March. “Real innovation makes us more productive, but it also, I think, dignifies our workers. It boosts our standard of living. It strengthens our workforce and the relative value of its labor.” “I can argue, in the developed countries, the big winners are the countries that have shrinking populations,” BlackRock founder Larry Fink said at a 2024 pro-globalist event hosted by the World Economic Forum in Saudi Arabia. Fink continued: That’s something that most people never talked about. We always used to think shrinking population is a cause for negative [economic] growth. But in my conversations with the leadership of these large, developed countries [such as China and Japan] that have xenophobic anti-immigration policies, they don’t allow anybody to come in — [so they have] shrinking demographics — these countries will rapidly develop robotics and AI and technology … “If a promise of all that transforms productivity, which most of us think it will [emphasis added] — we’ll be able to elevate the standard living in countries, the standard of living for individuals, even with shrinking populations,” Fink said.

Title: Musk’s xAI startup swallows up X social network in surprise deal

Elon Musk said his xAI artificial intelligence startup has acquired the X platform, which he also controls, at a valuation of $33 billion, marking a surprise twist for the social network formerly known as Twitter.“The combination values xAI at $80 billion and X at $33 billion,” the billionaire wrote Friday in a post on X. The value of X is $45 billion when including $12 billion of debt, he said, describing the purchase as an all-stock transaction.The deal gives the new combined entity, called XAI Holdings, a value of more than $100 billion, not including the debt, according to a person familiar with the arrangement, who asked not to be identified because the terms weren’t public. Morgan Stanley was the sole banker on the deal, representing both sides, other people said.For Musk, the deal streamlines his businesses and solidifies the relationship between the former Twitter and xAI, which has used information from the social network to hone its chatbot. The deal also offers a resolution to X’s other backers following months of uncertainty over the state of their investment as Musk’s changes led to an exodus of users and advertisers.“XAI and X’s futures are intertwined,” Musk posted. “Today, we officially take the step to combine the data, models, compute, distribution and talent. This combination will unlock immense potential by blending xAI’s advanced AI capability and expertise with X’s massive reach.”Musk, the world’s richest person, acquired Twitter for $44 billion in late 2022, a transaction that included debt. After taking control of the platform, he quickly moved to cut costs by slashing thousands of jobs, closing offices and renegotiating contracts. He also tried to make Twitter more aligned with what he calls “free speech absolutism” by eliminating certain content restrictions and allowing some banned accounts to return.But Musk also eroded a significant portion of the network’s advertising business in the process. Marketers fled the site for fear that their promoted posts would appear alongside unsavory content from users. Even with an expected boost in sales for 2025, X’s advertising business is still projected to be roughly half of what it was when Musk acquired the company.Over the past year, Musk has used the service to promote Grok, a chatbot developed by xAI that was trained, in part, with posts from X users. The startup is competing with AI firms such as OpenAI, which Musk co-founded before an acrimonious split with that company. “This helps integrate the system quite nicely,” said Shweta Khajuria, a Wolfe Research analyst who views the deal as a positive for both of Musk’s businesses. “This gives Grok a unique advantage” by providing access to vast amounts of training data while also allowing xAI to control — or even cut off — that data flow to other companies.Gene Munster, a managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management and an investor in both companies, wrote on X that the deal “makes a lot of sense” by giving xAI an in-house proprietary data set that other companies don’t have access to. “Grok brings the brains. X brings the distribution,” he posted. “OpenAI has the brains and brand distribution (e.g., Apple), but lacks X’s proprietary data. Long-term edge: xAI.”A spokesperson for X declined to comment, pointing Bloomberg to a post from X CEO Linda Yaccarino. “The future could not be brighter,” she wrote. It’s unclear whether this merger will affect her role as X’s CEO.Musk has a long history of blending his various operations by sharing investors, technology and employees. His AI business, in addition to training on X user data, has also shared office space with X in the San Francisco Bay area. X also amassed a $6 billion stake in xAI as of January, which further intertwined the businesses.Investors in xAI have included Sequoia Capital, Andreessen Horowitz, Fidelity Investments and BlackRock Inc. Some of the AI startup’s investors were also backers of X, including Andreessen Horowitz and Sequoia.Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Mandeep Singh wrote Friday that xAI’s acquisition of X could set a framework for deals involving other social networking companies.The deal “might be a sign that rivals including OpenAI, Anthropic, Perplexity and Mistral will pursue deals to enhance their consumer reach and distribution,” Singh wrote. “We believe smaller social-media players will actively seek alliances with providers of large language models, given the premium valuation for xAI at $80 billion, which is more than the combined market values of Snap, Pinterest and Reddit.”For most of Musk’s tenure as X’s owner, the social networking company was believed to be valued well below the $44 billion that Musk paid in late 2022. Fidelity, for example, had marked down its equity stake in the company by more than 70% as recently as November.But X has seen a slight business resurgence since Musk became a top adviser to President Donald Trump, a relationship that has brought some advertisers back in an effort to curry favor with the two men. X raised close to $1 billion in new equity from investors, Bloomberg reported this month, in a deal that gave the company a valuation in line with when Musk took it private in 2022.Banks that had also been holding onto debt from Musk’s Twitter purchase were also finally able to offload it earlier this year without taking a loss. At one point in 2022, that debt was marked at 60 cents on the dollar by some firms.X is on pace for its first year of advertising revenue growth since the Musk takeover, though some of those marketers are believed to be returning out of fear that Musk may sue them. The company is projected to generate $1.31 billion in US advertising sales in 2025, an increase of 17.5%, according to research firm Emarketer. Globally, X’s ad sales are estimated to be $2.26 billion this year, up 16.5%. “The combination values xAI at $80 billion and X at $33 billion,” the billionaire wrote Friday in a post on X.

Title: Meet The Other Billionaire Behind The Winning Bid For The Boston Celtics

ByGiacomo Tognini ByGiacomo Tognini Forbes Staff. Bruce Beal Jr. When the owners of the NBA’s Boston Celtics announced on March 20 that they were selling the team for $6.1 billion to a group of investors led by private equity executive William “Bill” Chisholm, the news shocked the sports world. Few even knew who Bill Chisholm was, though they quickly learned he went to his first Celtics game on his seventh birthday and had been a “rabid fan ever since” who “bleeds green.” But Chisholm isn’t the only die-hard billionaire fan buying into the Celtics for the first time. Boston native Bruce Beal Jr., a partner at real estate giant Related Companies, joined Chisholm and telecom billionaire Robert Hale in the deal. “I grew up in Boston, loving the Celtics," Beal said in a statement. Recalling the day he saw the Celtics win the 1984 NBA finals, he said “it was the best day ever. Fast forward to today, it’s come full circle.” At least one well-known person in sports was not surprised. NFL great Tom Brady congratulated Beal on his Instagram story shortly after the deal was announced. “The Boston boy is an owner of his Boston team,” he wrote, adding three fire emojis. “Congratulations Bruce Beal Jr.!!!” (Celtic punk rock band Dropkick Murphys' “I'm Shipping Up To Boston” provided the soundtrack for the post.) The Celtics investment, if it’s approved, won’t be Beal’s first foray into pro sports. The 55-year-old already owns a minority stake in the NFL’s Miami Dolphins, where he serves as vice chairman and was brought in after Related’s founder Stephen Ross bought a 95% stake in the team in 2009 at a $1.1 billion valuation. The Dolphins were valued at $8.1 billion (along with the Hard Rock Stadium, Formula 1’s Miami Grand Prix and the Miami Open tennis tournament) when Ross sold a 13% stake last December. Forbes estimates Beal’s minority stake in the Dolphins is worth more than $100 million. Outside of his NFL bet, Beal owes most of his fortune to Related, the New York-based real estate developer founded by Ross in 1972. Beal joined the firm in 1995 and rose to become president in 2012. Forbes estimates Beal is worth more than $1 billion. A representative for Related Companies declined to comment on the net worth estimate or to make Beal available for an interview. Bruce Beal Jr. (left) and his father Bruce Beal Sr. (right) at the preview celebration for The Shops & Restaurants at Hudson Yards in New York in 2019. Beal grew up in Boston in a real estate dynasty. His father, Bruce Sr., was the fourth generation of the family to run Boston-based property developer the Beal Companies, which was first established in 1878 by Beal Jr.’s great-great-grandfather Abraham Beal. As a child, Beal had different plans, telling Crain's New York in 2009 that he originally wanted to become the next Jacques Cousteau, going to marine biology camps and working at a fish market in Nantucket and a dolphin lab in Hawaii. He was also a rabid Celtics fan. “When I was 16, the Celtics were going public and I proudly used the money I made from summer landscaping to buy about 20 shares,” he said in a statement. “It was the first stock purchase I ever made.” After going public in 1986, the team delisted from the stock exchange in 2003 when it was purchased for $360 million by a group of investors led by Irving Grousbeck, whose family will retain a stake in the franchise until the second part of the $6.1 billion sale closes in 2028. Beal graduated from high school in 1988 at Concord Academy, a tony prep school in an affluent Boston suburb, and then went to Harvard, where he got a bachelor's of arts and was on the lightweight crew team. Two years after graduating from Harvard in 1993, he started working at Related. In 2003, he led Related’s joint venture with his father’s company to develop the Clarendon and One Back Bay, two apartment buildings with a combined 281 units in the Back Bay neighborhood of Boston. The apartments were completed in 2009, and four years later Beal Companies merged with Related to form Related Beal, which is now Related’s division in Boston. (Bruce Beal Sr. serves as Related Beal's chairman.) In 2007, Ross sold a 7.5% stake in Related to Goldman Sachs and Michael Dell’s MSD Capital. (MSD Capital later merged with Byron Trott’s merchant bank to form BDT & MSD Partners, run by Trott and Greg Lemkau, a former teammate of Bill Chisholm’s on Dartmouth’s varsity soccer team and also a Goldman Sachs alum. That firm was an advisor on the Celtics sale.) A year later, Ross bought 50% of the Miami Dolphins—plus the stadium and surrounding land—from billionaire Wayne Huizenga (d. 2018) for $550 million, buying another 45% stake in 2009 at a $1.1 billion valuation. By 2016, Beal had become a minority investor, and CBS Sports reported that the NFL had approved a succession plan with Ross granting Beal the right of first option to buy the Dolphins if Ross died or decided to sell his majority stake. In 2022, Ross reportedly changed his mind, giving that right to his daughter Jennifer instead. Bruce Beal Jr. (left), Jeff Blau (center) and Stephen Ross (right) in Hudson Yards in 2019, with the 150-foot tall Vessel behind them. Together with Ross and Related’s current CEO, Jeff Blau, Beal helped build Related Companies into a behemoth that’s developed or acquired $70 billion worth of residential, retail, office, hospitality and data center properties across the U.S., London and Abu Dhabi. “The company started in affordable housing, then we did market-rate rentals, and we built offices for companies like Nestlé and MasterCard,” Beal told Forbes in 2023, pointing to its diversification across different types of real estate. “We're very customer-driven, so we're constantly thinking about what our customers want.” But Beal didn’t just ride Ross’ coattails. Ross handed off day-to-day operations to Beal and Blau in 2012, appointing them as president and CEO, respectively. Ross used to tell the pair “‘I'm going to give you a really long leash, just don't hang yourself,'" Beal told Forbes in 2019. The trio worked together on many of Related’s largest projects, including Hudson Yards, a neighborhood on Manhattan's west side with 12 million square feet of offices, apartments and retail that cost $25 billion to build and opened in 2019. Despite a downturn in New York’s office market during the Covid-19 pandemic, Hudson Yards has been a success, with its office buildings now 98% occupied by tenants including BlackRock, Facebook parent Meta, Wells Fargo and L’Oréal. “From a developer standpoint, you have to execute every day. We not only have to get the buildings built, we have to run them,” Beal told Forbes in 2023. “So we're constantly thinking about what we can do better and evolve as the markets change.” Then in July 2024, Ross stepped down as executive chairman and left to form a separate company, Related Ross, in Palm Beach, Florida; he still holds a stake in the company and remains the firm’s non-executive chairman. Beal and Blau are now pushing ahead with new developments, including a proposed $12 billion makeover of the unfinished railyards west of Hudson Yards, called Hudson Yards West, that would include a Wynn Resorts casino if it wins one of the New York state gaming licenses up for grabs in December. The project will also have office space, residential buildings, a public school and a 5.6 acre park. Unlike his partner Ross—who’s decamped to Florida—Beal is bullish on New York. “People still want to be in New York. It'll cycle through and it always comes back,” Beal told Forbes in 2023. “We felt like if we did our job and put our heads down and executed, people would not only want to be in New York, but be in Hudson Yards." Still, the longtime New York resident maintains ties to Boston. He owns at least two homes in Related developments in the city and one of his children goes to school there. Now Beal will have an extra reason to find the time to go home to watch the Celtics. “[Boston] still feels like home,” Beal said in a statement. “I love the Celtics and I am honored to be a part of this incredible organization that means so much to Boston and fans like me, who grew up loving this team.”

Elon Musk has announced that his artificial intelligence startup, xAI, has acquired social media platform X (formerly Twitter) in a deal worth $45 billion. This acquisition, which includes $ 12 billion in debt, slightly surpasses the $44 billion Musk paid for Twitter in 2022 before rebranding it as X. The Tesla and SpaceX CEO shared the news of the acquisition on his X account, stating, “xAI and X's futures are intertwined. Today, we officially take the step to combine the data, models, computing, distribution and talent. This combination will unlock immense potential by blending xAI's advanced AI capability and expertise with X's massive reach.” What is Musk's xAI startup? Elon Musk founded xAI in 2023 with the vision of developing cutting-edge artificial intelligence models capable of competing with industry giants such as OpenAI, Google and Microsoft. Shortly after its launch, xAI introduced Grok, an AI-powered chatbot designed to provide real-time responses and engage with users in a conversational manner. Over time, Grok became an integral part of X, with users frequently using it to participate in discussions, seek information and generate insights, according to a report in NBC News. To improve its AI models, xAI has used data from social media interactions on X, refining Grok's ability to respond contextually and intelligently. This integration between xAI's technology and X's vast user-generated content has positioned Grok as a prominent and widely used feature on the platform. Amid the growing demand for AI-driven technologies, xAI has attracted significant interest from investors. Major Wall Street firms, including BlackRock, Fidelity, Morgan Stanley and Sequoia Capital, along with leading semiconductor giants Nvidia and AMD, invested in xAI in December 2024, pushing its valuation to $45 billion, the NBC News report said. More recently, the company secured an additional $10 billion in funding, further driving its valuation to an impressive $75 billion, according to a report in The Guardian. With expansion and growing investor confidence, xAI is solidifying its position as a major player in the AI landscape. Its acquisition of X could mark a big step in that direction. What is the future of xAI and X? While Elon Musk has not yet announced any immediate changes to X following its acquisition by xAI, he has hinted at a deeper integration of artificial intelligence into the platform. The deal, structured as an all-stock transaction, values xAI at $80 billion and X at $33 billion, accounting for $12 billion in debt. Musk described xAI as one of the world's fastest-growing AI labs, highlighting its rapid advancements in developing AI models and building data centres at an unprecedented scale. At the same time, the Tesla CEO emphasised X's transformation into a highly efficient company, now serving as the “digital town square” for over 600 million active users. He believes this acquisition positions the platform for scalable growth, using xAI's AI capabilities to improve user experiences and interactions. He reiterated xAI's core mission of “seeking truth and advancing knowledge.” Musk expressed gratitude to the teams at xAI and X for their dedication, calling this acquisition “just the beginning.” He also acknowledged the continued support of partners and investors.

Title: China's top market regulator says it will review CK Hutchison's Panama Canal ports deal according to law

Global Times By Global Times Published: Mar 28, 2025 09:38 PM China's State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) said it will review CK Hutchison's Panama Canal ports deal in accordance with laws to ensure fair market competition and protect public interests, according to a Q&A release conducted by Hong Kong Ta Kung Wen Wei (HKTKWW) Media with the market regulator published on its official website. The question raised by Hong Kong Ta Kung Wen Wei said that it is reported that Hutchison Ports, a subsidiary of Hong Kong-based conglomerate CK Hutchison Holdings, is expected to sign a transaction agreement with BlackRock on April 2 regarding the sale and whether the proposed transaction would require regulatory approval in China. A spokesperson from the second antitrust enforcement division of the State Administration for Market Regulation said that "We have noted this deal and will conduct a review in accordance with the law to ensure fair market competition and protect public interests." According to information on the official website of the SAMR, the second antitrust enforcement division of the SAMR is responsible for antitrust review of businesses' concentration of undertakings. It is also responsible for investigating and addressing illegal concentrations of undertakings, as well as those concentrations that, despite not meeting the notification thresholds, may eliminate or restrict competition. The division also provides guidance to Chinese enterprises on antitrust compliance in overseas markets. The potential sale of Hutchison Ports' Panama assets is attracting attention due to the strategic significance of port infrastructure and the involvement of a major US investment firm, according to the HKTKWW report. CK Hutchison said earlier this month that it agreed to sell most of the global $22.8 billion ports business, including assets it holds along the strategically important Panama Canal, to a group led by BlackRock. In total, the consortium will control 43 ports in 23 countries, according to Reuters. When asked about CK Hutchison's sale of its overseas ports business, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said on Thursday that China firmly opposes moves that infringe on and undermine other countries' legitimate rights and interests through economic coercion, hegemonism and bullying.

Title: Italy v Ireland: Injury-free Aoibheann Reilly to start as Irish side look for rare win on the road

Time Published: 2025-03-29T06:00:01Z

Resilience is an important character trait for any sportsperson, one that Ireland scrumhalf Aoibheann Reilly has displayed in battling back from not one but two ACL surgeries, one on each knee. The 24-year-old from Ballinasloe made her return to Test rugby off the bench in Ireland’s defeat to France last weekend. On Sunday in Parma she’ll start, forming a halfback partnership with Dannah O’Brien. Reilly tore the ACL in her right knee three years ago. The second time was while playing Sevens for Ireland in Madrid in the build-up to the Olympics, shattering a dream. While the injuries were the same the rehabilitation process differed from a mindset perspective. She explained: “First time around I was 21 and hadn’t played a whole lot for Ireland. So, I don’t know if I had that pressure on me to go back. “My rehab process was a bit longer, but this is a World Cup year, and I knew I needed to get back and get game time under my belt, especially after spending so long in Sevens. I was very focused, worked with some great physios to get me back fit and ready to perform. “It was a very emotional moment standing there for the anthems [last week in Belfast]. When I tore my ACL for the second time, before the Olympics last summer, I was just focusing on getting back for that France game. I knew that everything had to go right in my rehab journey to get back on the pitch, so it was a big moment for me and my family just wearing the green again.” She returned to the match arena in a little over eight months, the second time, playing a couple of games for the Clovers in the Celtic Challenge, which facilitated her return to the Irish team. During that absence she did come co-comms for television, European Challenge Cup games, and also was given a backroom role with Andy Farrell’s men’s squad. She said: “I was very lucky to have been asked to join the men’s team for the November internationals as a support analyst. It was a great way for me to develop my knowledge off-pitch, see how they run things and then also keep learning and growing my rugby IQ while I couldn’t be on-field. That was such a valuable experience and I’m very grateful to the IRFU and to the men’s squad for that. “While I was rehabbing here in HPC I would tailor my days with my physio so I could be there for their big pitch sessions and then I headed over to Portugal for a few days for their pre-camp, which was great. I also shadowed a bit on matchday which was a great insight.” Did she pick up any tips? “Just the way they operate, similar to us, they’re obviously professionals but it was interesting to see how they do things on matchday that are different but also similar to us. Just the level of experience they have in their squad and how they use that, seeing that was very valuable.” Reilly is one of three changes to the team that lost 27-15 to France last week. Ireland head coach Scott Bemand promotes Fiona Tuite, Edel McMahon – she takes over the captaincy – and Reilly from the bench with Dorothy Wall, Brittany Hogan and Emily Lane heading in the opposite direction. Italian head coach Fabio Roselli has made six changes to the side that was beaten 38-5 by England on the opening weekend of the tournament. Hooker Vittoria Vecchini, Gaia Maris, Sara Tounesi and Emma Stevanin swap the bench for a starting role, while number eight Elisa Giordano and centre Michela Sillari are the other alterations to the run-on team. There are a couple of positional switches with Alyssa D’Inca moving from centre to wing, Francesca Granzotto from wing to fullback and Francesca Sgorbini from number eight to flanker. Italy are looking for a hat-trick of wins over Ireland in the Six Nations, having won just one of the previous 16 matches between the sides. Ireland have lost 10 of their last 11 away games, including the previous seven, a streak they’d dearly love to break. There were aspects of the Irish performance last week that were promising but what can’t continue is the number of basic errors. Getting players on the ball like Aoife Wafer, Amee-Leigh Costigan, Stacey Flood, Linda Djougang, Aoife Dalton, Erin King who can break a game open is important but so too is a progression in quality in terms of the collective output. Do that and anything is possible. Italy: F Granzotto; A Muzzo, M Sillari, B Rigoni, A D’Inca; E Stevanin, S Stefan; S Turani, V Vecchini, G Maris; V Fedrighi, G Duca; S Tounesi, F Sgorbini, E Giordano.

Title: Panama Ports Deal on the Verge of Falling Apart Because of Chinese Government Opposition

Skip to comments. Posted on 03/28/2025 9:42:57 PM PDT by SeekAndFind The Chinese government has intervened to stop the planned April 2 sale of two Panama Canal ports owned by the Hong Kong conglomerate CK Hutchinson to the US-based conglomerate Black Rock. CK Hutchinson operates two of the five ports adjacent to the Panama Canal. Panama first awarded the company the concession to run the ports in 1998 and extended it for another 25 years in 2021. The Canal is a major maritime chokepoint and manages about 3% of the global maritime trade. The issue of Chinese ownership of critical ports serving the Panama Canal predates President Trump's second term; see Does China Run the Canal? – RedState. The administration launched a full-court diplomatic press that got Panama to withdraw from China's Belt and Road Initiative; see UPDATED: Trump Admin. Lays Down the Law Over Panama Canal, Sets Up Major Confrontation; Panama Folds – RedState and Panama Capitulates - Will Not Renew 2017 Deal With China. What's Next? – RedState. That led to an agreement by CK Hutchinson to sell its Panama facilities to Black Rock. This seemed like an early diplomatic win for President Trump; see China's Out: American Company Taking Control of Panama Canal Ports – RedState.Selling the Canal ports did not prove as popular in Beijing as in Washington. Over the past two weeks, pro-Beijing Hong Kong newspaper Ta Kung Pao has published a series of commentaries criticising the deal for harming China's national interests and depicting it as a betrayal of China and is a "perfect cooperation" with the U.S. strategy to contain China.China's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office reposted some of the commentaries on its website, which fueled speculation Beijing could take steps to try to scupper the sale.China's President Xi Jinping is reportedly angry about the deal. He saw Chinese ownership of the ports as a poke in the eye of American power and a bargaining chip in possible tariff negotiations.Now, Chinese antitrust regulators (yes, I did lol writing that) have been unleashed on the deal, which is much larger than two Panamanian ports.The sale of CK Hutchison’s two ports at each end of the Panama Canal was part of a US$23 billion dollar deal to sell 45 ports spread over 23 countries to a consortium led by United States investment firm BlackRock. CK Hutchison will pocket US$19 billion.“We have noticed this transaction, and will review it in accordance with the law to ensure fair competition in the market and safeguard the public interest,” a spokesman from the anti-monopoly department under the market regulator said in a written reply.The watchdog did not reveal when the investigation would be launched.The department is responsible for conducting antitrust reviews and providing guidance to companies over their response to mitigate risk and ensure compliance overseas.The deal may go through, but Black Rock may not end up with the ports. Though some sources say that talks are still underway between Black Rock and CK Hutchinson, nothing indicates this is anything more than wishcasting. Xi dislikes the deal; the sale has been denounced as a betrayal of China by the state press, and selling the ports to an American company is a blow to Chinese prestige, particularly in the context of Panama being offered a "deal it couldn't refuse" to leave the Belt and Road Initiative. CK Hitchinson is reportedly in talks with the Swiss-based Mediterranean Shipping Company, the world’s biggest container shipping operator that runs dozens of terminals globally. This would remove the point of friction of Chinese ownership without allowing Trump to claim victory.

Panama first awarded the company the concession to run the ports in 1998 and extended it for another 25 years in 2021. The Canal is a major maritime chokepoint and manages about 3% of the global maritime trade. The issue of Chinese ownership of critical ports serving the Panama Canal predates President Trump's second term; see Does China Run the Canal? – RedState. The administration launched a full-court diplomatic press that got Panama to withdraw from China's Belt and Road Initiative; see UPDATED: Trump Admin. Lays Down the Law Over Panama Canal, Sets Up Major Confrontation; Panama Folds – RedState and Panama Capitulates - Will Not Renew 2017 Deal With China. What's Next? – RedState. That led to an agreement by CK Hutchinson to sell its Panama facilities to Black Rock. This seemed like an early diplomatic win for President Trump; see China's Out: American Company Taking Control of Panama Canal Ports – RedState.Selling the Canal ports did not prove as popular in Beijing as in Washington. Over the past two weeks, pro-Beijing Hong Kong newspaper Ta Kung Pao has published a series of commentaries criticising the deal for harming China's national interests and depicting it as a betrayal of China and is a "perfect cooperation" with the U.S. strategy to contain China.China's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office reposted some of the commentaries on its website, which fueled speculation Beijing could take steps to try to scupper the sale.China's President Xi Jinping is reportedly angry about the deal. He saw Chinese ownership of the ports as a poke in the eye of American power and a bargaining chip in possible tariff negotiations.Now, Chinese antitrust regulators (yes, I did lol writing that) have been unleashed on the deal, which is much larger than two Panamanian ports.The sale of CK Hutchison’s two ports at each end of the Panama Canal was part of a US$23 billion dollar deal to sell 45 ports spread over 23 countries to a consortium led by United States investment firm BlackRock. CK Hutchison will pocket US$19 billion.“We have noticed this transaction, and will review it in accordance with the law to ensure fair competition in the market and safeguard the public interest,” a spokesman from the anti-monopoly department under the market regulator said in a written reply.The watchdog did not reveal when the investigation would be launched.The department is responsible for conducting antitrust reviews and providing guidance to companies over their response to mitigate risk and ensure compliance overseas.The deal may go through, but Black Rock may not end up with the ports. Though some sources say that talks are still underway between Black Rock and CK Hutchinson, nothing indicates this is anything more than wishcasting. Xi dislikes the deal; the sale has been denounced as a betrayal of China by the state press, and selling the ports to an American company is a blow to Chinese prestige, particularly in the context of Panama being offered a "deal it couldn't refuse" to leave the Belt and Road Initiative. CK Hitchinson is reportedly in talks with the Swiss-based Mediterranean Shipping Company, the world’s biggest container shipping operator that runs dozens of terminals globally. This would remove the point of friction of Chinese ownership without allowing Trump to claim victory.

Title: BlackRock’s bold bet lifts Solana sentiment to record levels – Could SOL surge next?
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/blackrocks-bold-bet-lifts-solana-sentiment-to-record-levels-could-sol-surge-next/
Time Published: 2025-03-29T03:00:35Z
Full Content:
SOL’s social sentiment is soaring on BlackRock and GameStop news, but price action signals caution. What’s next for Solana? Solana [SOL] has become the center of attention in the crypto market, riding a fresh wave of optimism fueled by institutional interest. With BlackRock launching yield-bearing tokenized treasury funds on the network and GameStop integrating Bitcoin through Solana’s [SOL] infrastructure, sentiment around SOL has surged to unprecedented levels. But will this social momentum translate into a price breakout? Data from Santiment reveals a sharp spike in Solana’s Positive/Negative Sentiment Ratio, climbing to 32.87 – far outpacing sentiment levels around Bitcoin [BTC], Ethereum [ETH], and Ripple[XRP]. This sharp divergence underscores a unique bullish tilt for SOL on social platforms, suggesting growing investor confidence. Source: Santiment The spike coincides with BlackRock’s strategic use of Solana’s infrastructure and GameStop’s broader crypto pivot, both of which have been heavily amplified by influencers and community support. This fusion of technological utility and mainstream integration has created the perfect storm for a sentiment-driven rally. Despite the sentiment frenzy, Solana’s price action is flashing caution. At the time of writing, SOL was trading at $132.49, registering a 4.27% intraday dip. The 50-day Moving Average (MA) at $133.74 has acted as a key resistance level, while the 200-day MA at $183.04 loomed far above, highlighting how much ground SOL needs to reclaim for a true trend reversal. Source: TradingView At press time, the Bollinger Bands were tightening, reflecting contracting volatility. Meanwhile, the Average True Range (ATR) sat at 6.18, suggesting that SOL remains in a low-volatility regime – a potential prelude to an explosive move in either direction. SOL’s price pattern indicates consolidation rather than a breakout despite the overly bullish sentiment among traders. This disparity suggests a potential disconnect between emotional optimism and technical resistance levels. Historically, such euphoria can be risky, especially when unsupported by volume and price action. However, Solana’s robust developer ecosystem and real-world applications in tokenized finance, like BlackRock’s recent initiative, offer solid fundamentals. If SOL surpasses the $140 mark and turns its short-term resistance into support, a rapid upward movement could follow, fueled by persistent social sentiment.

Title: Fidelity says Bitcoin could potentially overtake gold, echoing Saylor’s absorption theory

Fidelity's cautious view contrasts with Saylor's optimism as both eye Bitcoin's trajectory amid growing institutional support. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Fidelity Investments director of global macro Jurrien Timmer believes that Bitcoin (BTC) has a “possible” path to surpassing gold in market value — but “not any time soon.” In a detailed social media post, Timmer explained his view using a chart comparing the projected growth of gold and Bitcoin over time. He noted that if gold continues to grow at its historical compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8% — a trend seen since 1970 — and Bitcoin follows either a power law adoption curve or the internet’s S-curve growth model, the two could converge within the next 10 to 20 years. Timmer wrote: “If Bitcoin grows at the rate suggested by these two models, then hard money is likely winning the race, which suggests that gold will be appreciating faster than 8% per year. So, my guess is that gold will always be Bitcoin’s quieter older sibling.” The prediction is much more cautious than forecasts shared by other industry leaders like Galaxy and Strategy founder Michael Saylor. Timmer’s comments come amid significant volatility in crypto markets. Bitcoin fell below $84,000 again on March 28, equating to a roughly 33% decline against gold since its December peak. The price struggles come as inflation concerns and trade tensions continue to weigh on risk assets amid the subdued market sentiment. Meanwhile, gold continues to reach new all-time highs, reinforcing its long-standing role as a safe haven. Despite Bitcoin’s price decline, major institutions continue to show confidence in the asset. On March 27, Fidelity and BlackRock drove a combined $89 million into Bitcoin ETFs, led by Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), which saw $97.1 million in inflows. The continued capital injection signals growing institutional conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term prospects — even as near-term price action paints a more bearish picture. While Timmer offered a measured take, Strategy founder Michael Saylor recently presented a far more aggressive forecast. Speaking at the DC Blockchain Summit on March 28, Saylor predicted Bitcoin’s market cap could soar to $500 trillion as it absorbs value from traditional assets like gold, real estate, and even sovereign wealth. Saylor argued that Bitcoin is replacing “20th-century assets” with a digital, decentralized, inflation-resistant alternative. He compared the shift to historic changes in monetary systems — like European colonizers introducing coinage to societies that used beads or shells. Saylor added that the US has the “opportunity to grab” 25% to 30% of global Bitcoin value once the “dust settles” from this asset reorganization. Still, the debate is clearly shifting. As more institutional money flows in and long-term models project exponential adoption, the conversation is no longer whether Bitcoin belongs in the same conversation as gold — but when and under what conditions it might catch up. For now, Fidelity’s Timmer urged caution and said the flippening is “possible,” but gold — steady, quiet, and time-tested — still holds the upper hand.

Title: “This Is Existential”: Billionaire Cancer Researcher Says Covid & Vaccine Likely Causing Surge In Aggressive Cancers

DON'T GET LEFT OUT: HUNTER MUST BE STOPPED! by Contributing Author | Mar 28, 2025 | Health | 0 comments This article was originally published by Tyler Durden at ZeroHedge. Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong – a transplant surgeon-turned-biotech billionaire renowned for inventing the cancer drug Abraxane – has issued a startling warning in a new in-depth interview with Tucker Carlson. Soon-Shiong, founder of ImmunityBio ($IBRX) and owner of the Los Angeles Times, claims that the COVID-19 pandemic, and the very vaccines developed to fight it, may be contributing to a global surge in “terrifyingly aggressive” cancers. In the nearly two-hour conversation, the Los Angeles Times owner leveraged his decades of clinical and scientific experience to outline why he suspects an unprecedented cancer epidemic is unfolding. This report examines Dr. Soon-Shiong’s background and assertions, the scientific responses for and against his claims, new data on post-COVID health trends, and the far-reaching implications if his alarming hypothesis proves true. Soon-Shiong is a veteran surgeon and immunologist who has spent a career studying the human immune system’s fight against cancer. He pioneered novel immunotherapies and even worked on a T-cell based COVID vaccine booster during the pandemic. In the interview, he draws on this background to voice deep concern over rising cancer cases, especially among younger people – something he describes as a “non-infectious pandemic” of cancer. He tells Carlson that in 50 years of medical practice, it was extraordinarily rare to see cancers like pancreatic tumors in children or young adults, yet recently such cases are appearing. For instance, Soon-Shiong was alarmed by seeing a 13-year-old with metastatic pancreatic cancer, a scenario virtually unheard of in his prior experience. “I never saw pancreatic cancer in children… the greatest surprise to me was a 13-year-old with metastatic pancreatic cancer,” Soon-Shiong told Carlson, adding that he’s seen examples of very young patients (even children under 11 with colon cancer) and unusual surges in aggressive diseases like ovarian cancer in women in their 30s. These personal observations of more frequent, aggressive cancers in youth led him to probe what might have changed in recent years. “We’re clearly seeing an increase in certain types of cancer, like pancreatic cancer, ovarian cancer… colon cancer… in younger people.” — Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong According Soon-Shiong, the COVID era is the obvious change – and suggests that both the SARS-CoV-2 virus infection and the widespread vaccination campaigns could be key drivers behind this cancer spike. He emphasizes the massive scale of human exposure to the virus and its spike protein (via infection or vaccination). “I don’t know how to say that without saying it. It scares the pants off me because I think what we may be, I don’ think it’s virus versus man now, this is existential. I think when I talk about the largest non-infectious pandemic that we’re afraid of, this is it.” “Billions of people – literally billions – had the COVID virus. Over a billion got the spike protein vaccine,” said Carlson, adding “So that’s like, we’re talking like a huge percentage of the Earth’s population, unless I’m missing something.” “Now you understand what keeps you awake at night and kept me awake at night for two years, two and a half years,” Soon-Shiong replied, suggesting that exposure to both is silently undermining the immune system’s natural defenses against cancer on a global scale. Soon-Shiong frames COVID-era cancers as potentially virally triggered or exacerbated. In the interview, he described cases of “virally induced cancers” in clinics during the pandemic – patients whose cancers may have been kicked into overdrive by the cascade of inflammation and immune stress associated with COVID-19 (Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong: You’re Being Lied to About Cancer, How It’s Caused, and How to Stop It). COVID infection causes a massive inflammatory response, and some cancers are known to exploit inflammation to grow. TUCKER: “a lot people have pointed to both COVID, the virus, and to the mRNA COVID vaccines as potential causes. Do you think that they’re related?“ SOON-SHIONG: “The best way for me to answer that is to look at history. What we know about virally-induced cancers is well-established. We know that if you get hepatitis, you get liver cancer. Hepatitis is a virus infection. We know if you got human papillomavirus, HPV, you get cervical cancer.” We know that certain viruses directly cause cancer (e.g. HPV, Epstein-Barr), so it’s not unprecedented for a virus to play a role in oncogenesis. While SARS-CoV-2 is not a known oncovirus, Soon-Shiong worries its indirect effects – chronic inflammation, immune exhaustion, or “suppressor cells” that emerge in the wake of infection/vaccination – could be accelerating tumor development. “The answer is to stop the inflammation…clear the virus from the body,” he argues, positing that until we eradicate the lingering virus and restore immune balance, we may see mounting cancer cases. * * * Fight inflammation with IQ Biologix (super potent) Ultra Turmeric In sum, Dr. Soon-Shiong’s claim is that the pandemic has set the stage for an explosion of aggressive cancers: the COVID virus itself (especially if it persists in survivors) might suppress immune surveillance, and the mRNA vaccines “that didn’t stop it” might inadvertently contribute to an immunosuppressive environment. These effects, in his theory, could be unleashing cancers that the immune system would ordinarily have kept in check. Watch: A number of clinicians and researchers have reported similar worrying observations, though these remain largely anecdotal at this stage. One prominent voice echoing Soon-Shiong’s concern is Dr. Angus Dalgleish, a veteran oncologist and professor at St. George’s, University of London. In late 2022, Dalgleish wrote to the BMJ’s editor after noticing that some cancer patients who had been stable for years experienced “rapid progression of their disease after a COVID-19 booster.” He cited cases of individuals who were doing well until shortly after vaccination – new leukemias, sudden appearance of Stage IV lymphomas, and explosive metastases in patients who had post-vaccine bouts of feeling unwell. “I am experienced enough to know that these are not coincidental,” Dalgleish wrote, noting that colleagues in Germany, Australia, and the U.S. were independently seeing the same pattern. This frontline testimony aligns with Soon-Shiong’s fear: something about the immune system post-vaccination might be removing restraints on latent cancers. Dalgleish specifically pointed to short-term innate immune suppression after mRNA vaccination (lasting for several weeks) as a plausible mechanism. Many of the cancers he saw were ones normally held in check by immune surveillance (melanomas and B-cell cancers), so a temporary post-vaccine drop in immune vigilance could allow a tumor growth spurt. He also alluded to “suppressor gene suppression by mRNA in laboratory experiments” – a reference to preliminary studies that found the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein might interfere with key DNA repair or tumor-suppressor proteins in cells. These lab findings (while not yet confirmed in living organisms) lend some biological plausibility to the idea that spike exposure could affect cancer-related pathways. Beyond individual doctors, some research is probing links between COVID and cancer behavior. For example, a 2022 study in Frontiers in Oncology explored how SARS-CoV-2 proteins interact with cancer cells. It found that the virus’s membrane (M) protein can “induce the mobility, proliferation and in vivo metastasis” of triple-negative breast cancer cells in the lab (Frontiers | SARS-CoV-2 M Protein Facilitates Malignant Transformation of Breast Cancer Cells). In co-culture experiments, breast cancer cells exposed to the viral protein essentially became more aggressive and invasive. The researchers concluded that COVID-19 infection “might promote…aggressive [cancer] phenotypes” and warned that cancer patients who get COVID could face worse outcomes. While this is one specific context (breast cancer cells and one viral protein), it underpins Soon-Shiong’s general concern: the virus can directly alter the tumor microenvironment to the cancer’s advantage. Another line of evidence involves latent viruses and inflammation. Doctors have documented unusual reactivations of viruses like Epstein-Barr (which is linked to lymphomas and other malignancies) during both COVID-19 and post-vaccine immune reactions. Such reactivations hint at a period of immune dysregulation that might also let nascent cancer cells slip past defenses. Or course,fact-checkers and medical authorities argue that there is no credible evidence of vaccines causing meaningful immune suppression. “There isn’t evidence to date that COVID-19 vaccines cause cancer or lead to worsening cancer,” one infectious disease expert told FactCheck.org, though they do acknowledge rare side effects like myocarditis or blood clots were found, but not cancer. While the scientific community debates mechanistic links between COVID and cancer, independent analysts have been parsing population-level data for unusual patterns. One notable effort is by Phinance Technologies, a research firm co-founded by former BlackRock portfolio manager Edward Dowd. Phinance has been analyzing excess mortality and disability data since the pandemic, looking for signals of broad health impacts in the aftermath of COVID and mass vaccination. Their findings reveal concerning trends, especially among younger, working-age populations, that lend some weight to Dr. Soon-Shiong’s general warning of a post-COVID health crisis (though not specific to cancer alone). Phinance’s “Vaccine Damage Project” examined the U.S. population aged 16–64 (essentially the workforce) and stratified outcomes into four groups: no effect, mild injuries, severe injuries (disabilities), and death. Using official government databases (the CDC, Bureau of Labor Statistics, etc.), they estimated how each category changed starting in 2021 – when vaccines rolled out and COVID became widespread. The results are sobering. According to Phinance’s analysis, by the end of 2022 the U.S. had experienced approximately 310,000 excess deaths among adults aged 25-64 (a ~23% increase in mortality in that group over normal expectations). Notably, they argue that after mid-2021, with vaccines available and the virus itself becoming less deadly (due to immunity and milder variants), COVID-19 should not have been causing such high excess death rates. Therefore, those 310k “unexplained” deaths in 2021–2022 could represent an upper bound on vaccine-related fatalities or other pandemic collateral damage. Even more striking is the data on new disabilities. Phinance found that from early 2021 through late 2022, about 1.36 million additional Americans (age 16–64) became disabled – a 24.6% rise in disability in that cohort, far above historical trend. This jump in disabilities among the workforce correlates in time with the vaccine rollout (and was disproportionately higher in the labor force than among those not working). The analysts note that the healthiest segment of the population (employed working-age adults) saw a greater relative increase in disabilities after Q1 2021 than the older or non-working groups. This is unusual, since typically health shocks hit the elderly hardest – but here something was impacting younger, healthy people to a significant degree. Phinance investigated further and found a tight relationship between the cumulative number of vaccine doses administered and the rise in disabilities in 2021-22. In fact, for the 16–64 population, they computed a ratio of about 4 new disabilities per excess death in that period, suggesting many survivors were left with lingering health issues even if they didn’t die.

By Todd Spangler NY Digital Editor Wait — Elon Musk just sold X, the social network formerly known as Twitter, to himself? Well, kind of. Musk, in a post on X Friday, said that his artificial-intelligence company, xAI, has acquired X in an all-stock transaction that values X at $33 billion ($45 billion minus $12 billion in debt). The deal gives xAI a valuation of $80 billion, Musk claimed. Musk acquired Twitter in October 2022 for $44 billion and took the company private. What’s going on here? With the sale of X to xAI, Musk is merging the investor base of the social network with that of his AI company (some of which the two companies have in common). Musk had previously said that investors in X Corp. will own 25% of xAI. Related Stories VIP+ ‘Mickey 17’ Is Just the First Big Risk Warner Bros.

Musk, in his post, said that X has more than 600 million active users. “xAI and X’s futures are intertwined. Today, we officially take the step to combine the data, models, compute, distribution and talent,” he wrote. Musk claimed that the combination “will unlock immense potential by blending xAI’s advanced AI capability and expertise with X’s massive reach. The combined company will deliver smarter, more meaningful experiences to billions of people while staying true to our core mission of seeking truth and advancing knowledge. This will allow us to build a platform that doesn’t just reflect the world but actively accelerates human progress.” In addition to his business activities, which include serving as CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, Musk is the head of President Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency.
