Editor Podcasts Jeff Berwick, The Dollar Vigilante Happy Jewish Heritage Month! Brought to you by Jeff Berwickstein, the Mossad/CIA Global Connection Company, and NEOM: Trump & The Techno-rats’ new ‘self-regulated’ fantasy prison. NEOM… a 5-minute city spanning 106 miles, with no cars or streets, and housing 9 million people (because El Salvador will soon be full). It’s what happens when technocrats, Bond villains, and jewish/saudi/zionist billionaires join forces to build a utopia — for themselves — and a sandbox simulation for the rest of us. The acting players are, in no particular order: Elon Musk – visionary of surprise flamethrowers and self-drowning cars, now bringing Neuralink to your prefrontal cortex… whether you like it or not. Larry Fink – the BlackRock warlock who made sure your retirement fund now includes carbon credits and surveillance drones. Jeff Bezos – Amazon overlord who traded warehouse workers for humanoid robots with better bathroom privileges. Sam Altman – the guy who created ChatGPT and now wants to be your digital priest, philosopher, and parole officer. Donald Trump – making NEOM great again, one luxury neural re-education center at a time. Going around doing the same old globalist deals, setting up police states,smart cities, AI surveillance, digital tracking, lethal injections… and more desert Trump Towers. And, the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, who might or might not be jewish. This makes total sense of course, seeing as The Zon has promised to cut ties with old pal Bibi and Israhell. The Rothschild-owned newsflash said so! Right? It seems right now nothing, not even the gaping chasm that swallowed the Epstein files, can derail maggat NPC loyalty. It’s all just a GIANT COINCIDENCE that this futuristic prison city is almost exactly the size and location of the promised land of “Greater Israel”. Nicely cohen-ciding with Bibi Nethanyahu’s plans for a massive free trade zone with rail service to NEOM. (Who said jews and muslims can’t work together for the greater good?) To the believers: Rest easy knowing the High Council of NEOM — Musk, Fink, Bezos, Altman, and Trump (holographic 2025 version) — meets monthly in a carbon-neutral bunker to discuss your happiness metrics and whether you should be allowed to dream in color. Because you’re free. The TV on your retina says so. The AI says so. Even your dreams are branded with the NEOM logo and soothing slogans like, “Progress is Obedience.” So buckle in, Citizen. NEOM isn’t just the future — it’s the prototype for the world they really want. Because when the elite says the planet needs saving, they mean from you.

With everyone from Wall Street giants like BlackRock to the U.S. government getting involved, the leading cryptocurrency is now more mainstream than ever. You can even buy burgers with it. So it begs the question: Why is it still so hard for some people to understand and accept? With traditional finance heavyweights like investor Warren Buffett and JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon slamming the asset, it's appears that some people will never be open to Bitcoin. Speaking to Decrypt, Blockstream CEO and well-known early Bitcoiner Adam Back said that this is nothing new—and that even techies struggle to get their head around the cryptocurrency. Calling continued skepticism "confusing," Back used the example of cypherpunks back in the day who seemed uninterested in Bitcoin. He thought it was "crazy" that some of them didn’t get onboard. "You understood all about code, peer-to-peer networks, privacy, public key cryptography, and secure sockets layer," he added. "Like, you have a huge leg up in understanding this, and you're not interested. What gives?" Cypherpunk Back—who had an email exchange with the cryptocurrency's mysterious, pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008—said the fact that so-called digital gold isn't physical might be why some people remain suspicious of Bitcoin after all these years. "Some are skeptical about something that's not physical and yet has a scarcity," he commented, adding that the coin is still backed by physical resources like energy and mining equipment. Bitcoin is a digital payments system and virtual currency, and only 21 million digital coins will ever be minted into existence, thanks to the project's super-secure cryptographic engineering. Still, JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon expressed cynicism over the leading crypto's code. In a 2023 interview, Dimon asked: "How do you know it's gonna stop at 21 million? Everyone says that," before adding, "Bitcoin itself is a hyped-up fraud." Of course, the billionaire banker also said his firm used the blockchain—a technology created by Satoshi. “Bitcoin itself is a hyped-up fraud,” says @jpmorgan CEO Jamie Dimon. “Crypto is a decentralized Ponzi scheme…It’s a pet rock.” pic.twitter.com/9KQfckty8f — Squawk Box (@SquawkCNBC) January 19, 2023 The biggest and oldest cryptocurrency was created with global banking failures in mind, with the original white paper released during the 2008 recession. A message referencing a newspaper article covering the situation was even inscribed on the network's genesis block. Now, Bitcoin advocates argue that the cryptocurrency can work as a true inflation hedge due to its scarcity. Back added that "for people who the establishment order is working," they may never understand the potential benefits of Bitcoin, nor may they trust something "more grassroots" in nature than fiat currency and traditional finance. "If they've got a high-paying job, they're working their way up the career ladder, things don't look too expensive for them, and they can afford mortgages," said Back, "then maybe they don't feel it."

Title: VanEck Exec Slams SEC For Delay On Bitcoin ETF Options – Details

Time Published: 2025-05-25T10:00:45Z
Full Content:
Matthew Sigel, the head of digital assets research at VanEck, has criticized the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over a delayed response on a proposal to list options trading on the firm’s Bitcoin Spot ETF. Notably, the Commission has continued to issue delayed responses to all recent digital asset-related ETF proposals/amendments despite a crypto-friendly policy of the Donald Trump Administration. On April 3, 2025, the Chicago Board of Exchange (Cboe) filed a proposed rule change to list options trading on the VanEck Bitcoin ETF (HODL). For context, options trading grants investors the right to buy and sell an asset at a specific price before a certain date. Following the resounding success of the US Bitcoin Spot ETFs, options trading became a potential mode of market expansion, with several asset managers submitting applications to offer options to their respective ETFs. Notably, the SEC has granted approval for this request for multiple Bitcoin ETFs, including the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust (BTC), and the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB), among others. However, following the initial 45-day review, the Commission has delayed a response on Cboe’s proposal to list trading options on the VanEck Bitcoin ETF (HODL). In an X post on May 23, Matthew Sigel strongly criticized this decision, which he described as “frustrating” and offered no transparency to investors. While tagging Hester Pierce, the Head of the SEC’s Crypto Task Force, Sigel complained that the Commission had issued a delayed response while offering no comments or feedback along with this decision. The VanEck Exec explained the asset manager’s objection to this development while responding to a user comment. He said. This was the first decision date, so it has not been rejected, just delayed, even though the SEC’s initial comments were addressed. It’s the lack of any feedback that is particularly irksome… It is highly worth noting that delayed responses by the SEC have been quite a common response for digital assets ETF-related proposals. The Commission can choose to wait till the final decision deadline, i.e., 240 days after the application, as seen with the Bitcoin Spot ETFs in 2024. However, Sigel’s concerns stem from an absence of an explanation on this delayed ruling, especially considering that options trading has been approved for certain other Bitcoin Spot ETFs. At the time of writing, Bitcoin trades at $108,349, reflecting gains of 5.23% and 17.71% in the past seven and 30 days, respectively. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: ‘Menstrual health affects everything - our work, our relationships, our mental health. Yet it’s still whispered about’

Hazel Wallace is just home after a celebratory brunch in London, a warm and glittering event to mark the publication of her fourth book, Not Just a Period. She has shared glimpses of the picturesque gathering on her Instagram feed, the pictures nestled alongside her signature posts: beautifully plated blueberry oats recipes for the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, yoga flows for cramps, and finish-line shots from the London and Paris marathons. Her grid is a blend of evidence-based wellness and digital elegance – but behind the polish is a deeper mission. The 34-year-old is originally from Blackrock, Co Louth, but now lives in London where she has become one of the UK‘s most prominent voices in women’s health, a medical doctor, registered associate nutritionist, personal trainer and bestselling author. But she wasn’t always on this path. In fact, her early career was shaped not by ambition, but by loss. “When I was 14, I lost my dad to a stroke,” she says. “It was really shocking. He had a mini-stroke while we were having dinner. He was in hospital for a few days, and then he passed. It was the first time someone in my family had been seriously unwell, and it changed everything.” The grief, she says, didn’t arrive all at once. “I didn’t fully understand it at the time. I missed a lot of school. I became socially withdrawn. I didn’t take care of myself.” In the aftermath, her interest in medicine grew – slowly at first. “His death was partly preventable, and I think that stuck with me. I became really focused on health in a broader sense – nutrition, stress, movement – things we hardly touched on in medical school.” Wallace didn’t get the points she needed to study medicine in Ireland, but she was determined to pursue her passion so she headed to Wales to do medical sciences, followed by medicine at Cardiff Medical School. In 2012, as a first-year med student, she started a blog called The Food Medic. “Honestly, I started it for myself,” she says. “I wanted to learn more about nutrition, about how lifestyle affects health. It was a way of figuring it out in public.” The blog and her Instagram following rapidly grew as she moved to London in 2016. Her ascent coincided with the rising popularity of wellness influencers, some of whom spread dangerous misinformation. Wallace‘s platform stood out because it was grounded in science. “There was this moment when people started demanding more credible advice,” she says. “And I was one of the first few with both a medical and nutrition background.” A post shared by Dr Hazel Wallace BSc MSc MBBCh (@drhazelwallace) The blog blossomed into several books, media appearances and, now, an online community of more than 1.1 million followers. But that success came at a cost. “For a long time, I had an unhealthy relationship with productivity,” she admits. “I tied my self-worth to academic success and professional output. I think I was also using it as a distraction – if I was busy, I didn’t have to stop and feel.” The pandemic, she says, made the limits of that model painfully clear. “By the second year of Covid, I was working in one of the only long-Covid clinics in the [UK]. There were just four of us. On weekends, I was covering intensive care shifts. I was exhausted and completely burnt out.” She took a step back from work, intending it to be temporary. “But I didn’t go back. It was hard to let go of that identity – I always thought of myself as a doctor in scrubs. But I wasn’t well. And I knew I couldn’t keep going like that.” This shift had come after a health crisis had already given Wallace a reason to slow down. In 2016, she began experiencing symptoms that didn’t quite add up. After two years of pushing for tests and consultations, she was finally diagnosed with PCOS – polycystic ovary syndrome, a hormone condition affecting one in 10 women which can lead to irregular or absent periods, difficulty conceiving, acne, anxiety, weight gain and excess hair. “I was already a qualified doctor, and it still took years and a lot of self-advocacy to get a diagnosis,” she says. “Even then, the advice was basically, ‘Come back when you want to get pregnant.’ That was it.” The experience left her feeling adrift. “I still felt in the dark about what to do. And if I felt that way with a medical background, how must everyone else be feeling?” [ Polycystic ovarian syndrome: ‘There’s more information on outer space than there is on the reproductive system of a female’Opens in new window ] This experience was part of what drove her to write her third book, The Female Factor, which explored how the male body has always been the default body in clinical medicine and research, leaving so much of women’s health unexplored, unacknowledged and unsupported. The Female Factor aimed to be a comprehensive guide to women’s health and included facts and tips on hormones, nutrition, mood, sleep and recipes. Her PCOS diagnosis had also prompted Wallace to think about fertility. She wanted children, but didn’t feel ready for them yet, and decided in 2023 to freeze her eggs – an experience she eventually shared with her followers. “I documented the process but waited until I was through it to decide whether or not to post. Even with all my training, it was intense – emotionally and physically. The daily injections, the hormone swings. It caught me off guard.” What struck her most was how little practical information there was. “It made me realise just how many gaps exist – not just in care, but in what women know about their own bodies. That’s what compelled me to share my experience. I knew if I was surprised by the process, others would be too.” During the pandemic, Wallace had noticed a disturbing trend whereby some women were attributing a disruption in their menstrual cycle – most likely caused by the stress of the pandemic – to the Covid vaccine, reinforcing anti-vax conspiracy theories. Without basic information about how periods can be affected by stress, misinformation and fearmongering grew. “People were convinced the vaccine was disrupting their periods, but the research showed it was temporary and likely stress-related,” she explains. “It really highlighted how little we understand about menstruation – even among people who menstruate.” We‘re taught to ignore hunger, to keep ourselves small. But your metabolic rate increases before your period - that’s why you’re hungrier. That’s not weakness. That’s biology That gap in understanding was one of the catalysts for Not Just a Period, which aims to be a comprehensive, empowering guide to the menstrual cycle. She‘s particularly critical of the way women’s pain and mood are pathologised. The book highlights that women are statistically twice as likely to experience depression, especially around hormonal shifts like puberty, the premenstrual phase, post-partum and menopause – but instead of receiving support, women are dismissed, patronised and laughed at. “Instead of support, we‘re often dismissed. We‘re told we‘re being ‘moody’ or ‘emotional‘. But those mood changes often have physiological roots – and they deserve proper care.” She points to PMDD – premenstrual dysphoric disorder – as a prime example. “People with PMDD can lose years of their life to disability. But they’re frequently misdiagnosed or not taken seriously. It’s not just frustrating – it’s harmful.” In the book Wallace highlights the medical gaslighting that women often experience, and the shame that prevents women from taking paid sick leave off for periods of PMDD, instead suffering in silence and losing money to a health issue that should be treated as such. Wallace‘s book doesn’t shy away from these hard truths. But it also offers practical tools – how to work with your cycle instead of against it, how to recognise shifts in mood or energy, how to support your body nutritionally through each phase. She also encourages cycle tracking, which she sees as a vital tool for body literacy. “It’s not just for fertility,” she says. “It’s about understanding yourself. Noticing patterns. Feeling more in control.” Still, she recognises the complexities around menstrual data and privacy. When I ask about how some American women have stopped using tracking apps due to political changes in reproductive rights, she‘s sympathetic. “I completely understand that concern. In the UK, we’re not facing the same kind of threats, but it’s a reminder that we need to be informed about where our data goes. Transparency matters.” [ What is causing girls to get their period at an earlier age?Opens in new window ] Another key theme in the book is how diet culture intersects with menstruation, noting that many women see an increase in appetite around their period but don’t feel able to fuel themselves because we‘ve been taught to value thinness over our bodies’ needs. “We‘re taught to ignore hunger, to keep ourselves small. But your metabolic rate increases before your period – that’s why you’re hungrier. That’s not weakness. That’s biology.” Wallace sees the consequences of this first hand in her practice. “Women restrict, then binge. Then feel guilty. It’s a cycle that can be avoided if we just listened to our bodies more and judged them less.” Body image also takes a hit premenstrually, she notes. “Even if nothing physically changes, many women feel bigger, bloated, uncomfortable. The way we speak to ourselves becomes harsher. Understanding that it’s hormonal can really help shift the narrative.” Social media complicates the issue of body image further. Wallace recognises the tension between trying to educate women about body image, health difficulties and natural struggles on a platform known for perpetuating rigid beauty standards and toxic comparisons. A post shared by Dr Hazel Wallace BSc MSc MBBCh (@drhazelwallace) Wallace’s own social media matches a lot of the aesthetic standards that can make health education feel alienating to some: she is slim and attractive, her recipes are colourful and prettily presented, and even while training for marathons she manages to look pulled together while jogging and balancing a camera to capture her journey. She‘s aware of the danger of “the highlight reel” vision of life that Instagram can create, and is wary of pages that promote a certain body type rather than education about health and lifestyle choices. “Instagram has been incredible for sharing information, but it also promotes a narrow beauty standard. Even when posts are well intentioned, they often still centre bodies that meet narrow beauty standards,” she says. “I try hard not to put my body at the centre of my content. It’s about the message, not the mirror. It’s not about how I look. But a lot of health influencers still lead with abs, with before-and-after shots. It’s toxic – and it’s confusing. People assume that if they follow the advice, they’ll look like the person giving it. That’s not health – that’s marketing.” [ Endometriosis and me: I hope young women today know they should shout louder than I didOpens in new window ] Still, she admits the pressure to create content that reaches audiences can be exhausting. “There‘s this constant push to make content prettier, punchier, faster,” she says. “And educational content – especially about periods – is not favoured by the algorithm. You have to work extra hard to be seen.” Wallace’s marathon training videos and recipes for the luteal phase might look effortless, but she schedules shoots like shifts. “It’s my job,” she says. “But I’ve also had to protect myself.” She‘s developed rules: no scrolling before 8am or after 6pm. “Even I get caught in the comparison trap. I’d look at other creators and think, ‘I should be doing more.’ And that’s not sustainable.” As she looks ahead, Wallace is preparing for her wedding this autumn in Greece to online fitness coach and Too Hot To Handle star David Birtwistle. But for now, she‘s trying to slow down and give this book the space it deserves. “I’ve been guilty of rushing into the next thing. Not this time. I want Not Just a Period to land, to start conversations, to help people. Menstrual health affects everything – our ability to work, our relationships, our mental health. And yet it’s still whispered about,” she says. “I want Not Just a Period to change that.” Because to Wallace, the menstrual cycle isn’t just a health issue. It’s a lens through which we understand how the world treats women – and how women are taught to treat themselves.

Title: Murder of Irish-American woman shocks wealthy Brussels suburb
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/crime-law/2025/05/25/murder-of-irish-american-woman-shocks-wealthy-brussels-suburb/
Time Published: 2025-05-25T04:30:00Z

The killing initially looked like a burglary gone wrong. Carmel Delaney, an Irish-American woman in her early 60s, had been stabbed to death in her home, in a wealthy Brussels neighbourhood popular with diplomats and business executives. The suspected murder – and the details that would later emerge – have gripped the Belgian public for weeks. Ms Delaney was born in New York, but her mother was originally from Ballyclerihan, Co Tipperary and her father from Dublin, so growing up she spent many childhood summers back visiting Ireland. A mother of four adult children, with two young grandchildren, Ms Delaney was someone who made friends easily. There were hiking and travel companions, and tennis and bridge playing partners, in Brussels and the many other cities she had lived in throughout her life. “She was so social,” an Irish relative of Ms Delaney said. Her husband, Chris Delaney, was a senior executive at US tyre giant Goodyear, overseeing its business in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, from Brussels, where the couple had lived for the last seven years. At a little past 8pm on March 17th, St Patrick’s Day, Belgian police received an emergency call. Mr Delaney had opened the door of their apartment in the leafy Brussels suburb of Woluwe-Saint-Pierre, to find his wife dead inside the home. An autopsy later revealed she had been stabbed about four times in the neck and chest, with some type of sharp object. Police investigating the crime scene suspected a possible burglary gone wrong. “The victim’s husband had discovered her body in their home and found that three luxury watches had been stolen,” the Brussels public prosecutor said in a statement. However, there was no obvious signs of someone forcing their way into the apartment. Then three weeks later came an arrest. A female colleague of Mr Delaney was taken in for questioning. The next day she was charged with murder. In a statement, the prosecutor confirmed a suspect who worked with Mr Delaney had been charged with murder and possession of a weapon. One line of investigation Belgian police had pursued was the possibility Mr Delaney and his coworker were involved in a romantic relationship, according to reports in local media. The prosecutor said they could not disclose further details. Some early hearings in the criminal case took place in front of a French-speaking judge, but it has since been transferred to a Flemish judge. A lawyer representing the accused did not respond to requests for comment. In the upmarket suburb where the Delaney couple lived, the killing has shocked locals. “The whole area is one of the best in Brussels,” said a retired EU official who lives nearby. “You would compare it with Blackrock in Dublin.” “We say in French, it’s something that can happen anywhere in the world”, he said of Ms Delaney’s killing. The area is popular with wealthy diplomats and officials who work in the nearby European Union institutions. Luxembourg’s ambassador to the EU lives across the road from the Delaney’s home, and the embassy of Kosovo is only a few buildings down from their apartment block. A team of four gardeners from a private firm were tending to rows of well-kept hedges that run along both sides of the whole street on Thursday afternoon. It’s the sort of place you might expect to see a Porsche drive by – and, while The Irish Times was there, two did so within 20 minutes of each other. The owner of a small local business said she only learned of the tragedy when journalists from the Belgian media began to descend on the leafy street. Another woman on her way to work said Woluwe-Saint-Pierre was a very quiet area. “It’s not that kind of neighbourhood where you would expect ...” she said, before trailing off and stopping. Ms Delaney and her husband had been due to retire to the United States and return to New York, after careers that had seen them both work across the world. She grew up in Horseheads, a small village in upstate New York, before moving to Bardonia, which is closer to the city. Those who knew her said she had fond memories of summer trips back to Ireland as a child. Her parents had met on a blind date. Her mother, Maureen O’Dwyer, was the second eldest of 11 siblings, in a family that had a farm and stables in Ballyclerihan, keeping and breeding racehorses. Her father, Jim Gallagher, was from Dublin. After graduating from Cornell University in 1985, Ms Delaney got a job with consumer goods giant Procter & Gamble (P&G), where she worked for 15 years, across the US, Saudi Arabia, Poland and Ukraine. It was in P&G that she met Mr Delaney. The couple later moved to Sydney, Australia, where they lived for several years. Around that time Ms Delaney set up her own company, International Education Resources, which provided assistance to international students applying to study in the US. They had a holiday home in the Catskills, a mountainous part of New York state, where they spent summers hiking and winters skiing. “They were a force,” one person who knew the couple said. Then in 2017 the pair moved to Brussels, as Mr Delaney was promoted to run Goodyear tyre and rubber company’s Europe, Middle East and Africa office. The company has spent recent weeks firefighting the fallout of media coverage of Ms Delaney’s killing, which often prominently mentions Goodyear. It is understood a team of “crisis communications” consultants have been drafted in to help the firm. Mr Delaney is no longer employed by the US company and has since retired. During her time in the Belgian capital Ms Delaney became heavily involved in a women’s social club, organising hikes and running its website. There she was known for her “unwavering positivity”, the Brussels Women’s Club committee said in a message of condolence posted online after her death. “Her life motto, ‘bloom where you are planted,’ embodied her ability to adapt, grow and thrive wherever life took her,” the group wrote. She made an effort to travel to Ireland at least once a year most of her adult life, one of her Irish relatives said. “Carmel was a wonderful girl ... We loved her”.

Title: Altcoins Lag As Bitcoin Price Breaks $111,000: Why This Bull Market Is Different From 2021
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/altcoins-lag-behind-bitcoin/
Time Published: 2025-05-25T00:30:04Z

Crypto firm Matrixport has delivered insights into why this bull market is different from the 2021 bull run. Their analysis sheds more light on why altcoins are lagging despite the Bitcoin price rally to a new all-time high (ATH) at $111,900. In an X post, Matrixport stated that many traders are missing out on the current Bitcoin price rally as traditional retail engagement indicators remain low despite the rally to a new ATH. The firm explained that this rally is happening thanks to institutional investors, with retail investors on the sidelines in this bull market. Matrixport noted that this explains why funding rates remain subdued, retail activity is low, and many altcoins continue to lag as the Bitcoin price rallies in this bull market. The firm also revealed that retail traders make the fundamental mistake of not anticipating market corrections, leading to them occasionally closing their positions during sharp drawdowns. This bull market also differs from 2021 in that retail’s share of Bitcoin ownership is no longer expanding. Crypto whales have stepped in and are absorbing most of the flagship crypto’s supply, kicking retail investors to the curb. Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas once noted that this could explain why the Bitcoin price has held up well during major corrections. According to Matrixport, understanding how corporate demand influences the Bitcoin price behavior and how long this trend is likely to last is critical as the shift in this bull market progresses. Meanwhile, the absence of retail traders in this cycle explains why funding rates and trading volumes are relatively low, with altcoins lagging. The firm noted that market participants are witnessing a quiet transfer of Bitcoin from early adopters and investors, miners, and exchanges to corporations like Strategy and institutional investors like BlackRock. Matrixport again asserted that the current Bitcoin price rally is driven by spot market accumulation and not derivatives activity, which could explain why altcoins are lagging behind BTC. In an X post, crypto analyst Kevin Capital stated that the next important step is for the Bitcoin price to record a weekly close above $106,800 and then follow through or consolidate next week. He remarked that BTC is really the only thing that matters and urged market participants to take their eyes off altcoins. If the Bitcoin price fails to accomplish that goal, the analyst stated that market participants can then turn their attention to the reverse psychology 2021 fractals. It is worth mentioning that the analyst once predicted that altcoins led by Dogecoin will still have their run once BTC’s dominance cools off in the summer. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $108,258, down almost 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

For Ethereum’s proponents, drawing comparisons has been useful—but even then, the analogy is far from perfect. When Vivek Raman introduced Etheralize in January, the former banker and business development firm’s co-founder formalized efforts to onboard Wall Street. Part of that initiative, he recently told Decrypt, has involved “evangelization and education and marketing.” “I always call it digital oil,” Raman said. “We think that as the crypto ecosystem evolves, people not only will want to—but will have to—hold this asset in reserves.” Bitcoin’s proponents often portray the asset as a form of digital gold because of pre-programmed scarcity, with a maximum supply of 21 million. ETH, whether it’s being consumed to send transactions or power smart contracts, fuels Ethereum’s network. The analogy, in that sense, is among the most palatable for today’s crypto newbies. As Raman and 19 others at Etheralize encourage financial institutions to build products on Ethereum, the ways in which the “digital oil” analogy falls short could illustrate challenges Ethereum’s community will face in cementing the network’s dominance on Wall Street, in capturing the asset’s qualities in a snappy, memorable way. “I think it is hard to come up with the right metaphor,” Grayscale Head of Research Zach Pandl told Decrypt. “It will be interesting to see whether investors begin to appreciate the scarcity of ETH, even if they're not yet kind of using the chain from a transactional standpoint.” One key difference: If demand for oil increases, then more is often pumped in response, and its supply is elastic. Ethereum, on the other hand, has a maximum issuance of 1.5% a year, meaning that its supply can only grow a certain amount over a period. On top of that, transaction fees on Ethereum are burned, which can offset that growth in supply. “Rather than having some sort of fixed cap of total supply, there's a fixed cap of issuance per year,” Etheralize co-founder Danny Ryan, a former Ethereum Foundation researcher, told Decrypt. “There's very much predictability.” Another major difference between Ethereum and oil is that the latter commodity does not offer yield. Staked Ethereum, which is devoted to the network for the ability to help process transactions, currently has an estimated yield of 3% annually, according to a dashboard published on the crypto analytics platform Dune. Within the coming years, financial institutions are expected to grow more comfortable with the practice of tokenization, in which real-world assets, such as stocks and bonds, are represented on-chain. Regulatory shifts under U.S. President Donald Trump could be a key driver. Some firms, such as crypto exchange Kraken, are tapping Ethereum competitors like Solana for such offerings. However, several funds have been tokenized on Ethereum by staid financial firms, including BlackRock and Franklin Templeton. As more assets come on-chain, one aspect of Ethereum’s “digital oil” analogy could become more valid. Much like oil is a neutral asset connecting myriad industries to each other, Ethereum could be seen as a non-sovereign asset for the modern financial system, Raman argued. “In this ecosystem where the world's assets are all tokenized by different counterparties, [...] the only neutral asset that's global, that connects all of these, is ETH,” he said. “It becomes more and more important as a global trading pair, as a strategic asset to hold if you want to stay in neutrality between all of these different tokenized assets.” Edited by James Rubin Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2025 Decrypt Media, Inc.

ByBecca Bratcher ByBecca Bratcher, Contributor. The crypto landscape is becoming more dynamic and accessible. Crypto is in for another wild ride in the second half of 2025. From DeFi projects and stablecoin acceleration to the growing overlap of AI and crypto, there is a lot to watch. This article breaks down the biggest trends set to shape the space and how these developments could transform digital assets. The crypto landscape has transformed dramatically in 2025, driven by regulatory developments, technological advancements, and shifting market dynamics. Donald Trump’s return to office has brought a pro-crypto agenda to the forefront, with the U.S. government establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and signaling plans for clear, industry-friendly regulations. This shift has sparked renewed interest in digital assets, with institutional investors re-entering the market and major financial players expanding their crypto services. Looking ahead, 2025 is about making crypto more useful and easier to understand. Innovations in stablecoins, decentralized finance and tokenization give investors new ways to use digital assets. These changes could make payments faster, give more people access to investment opportunities and simplify transactions. It all points to crypto becoming a bigger part of everyday finance. As digital assets continue to mature, several key trends are gaining momentum. Stablecoins are becoming more mainstream, while new AI-powered crypto applications are pushing the boundaries of automation and data analysis. DeFi is diversifying with more sophisticated protocols, and bitcoin secondary investments, such as ETFs and derivatives, are drawing institutional interest. Meanwhile, tokenizing real-world assets is becoming a game-changer, bringing physical assets like real estate, commodities and fine art onto the blockchain. These developments could reshape how digital assets are used, traded and regulated. This section will explore each trend, offering insights into its potential impact and what it means for investors. Stablecoins have become a critical part of the crypto ecosystem, and their influence will only continue to grow in the second half of 2025. These digital currencies, which are pegged to stable assets like the U.S. dollar, offer the benefits of blockchain technology without the volatility of other cryptocurrencies. Tether, the largest stablecoin issuer, is leading the charge, preparing to launch a U.S.-based stablecoin while working closely with U.S. lawmakers to shape crypto regulations. The broader stablecoin market is also evolving. With the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency reaffirming that banks can engage in stablecoin activities and new players entering the space, competition is heating up. Stablecoins are no longer just a tool for crypto traders. They are becoming a bridge between traditional finance and the digital economy, offering instant settlement, reduced transaction costs and a stable gateway to the world of digital assets. The intersection of cryptocurrency and AI is quickly becoming a major trend in 2025, with decentralized AI networks gaining attention. One notable example is Bittensor, a blockchain-based platform that enables users to create, share and monetize AI tools without relying on centralized tech giants. Bittensor’s model is built around subnets, independent communities focusing on specific AI tasks. This approach allows developers to collaborate and compete while maintaining transparency. This system ensures that high-quality work is recognized, while underperformers are removed. For developers and investors, this creates a more merit-based and sustainable ecosystem. Other projects, like Ambient, are pushing even further by creating blockchain networks that integrate AI directly into their core operations. Ambient, backed by top venture firms like a16z and Delphi Digital, aims to be a decentralized competitor to centralized AI giants like OpenAI. As these crypto-AI hybrids grow, they promise a future where AI tools are open, decentralized and more secure, making this a trend worth watching for the rest of 2025. DeFi has long been one of the most dynamic sectors in the crypto industry, but 2025 is shaping up to be a turning point. For years, DeFi thrived in a largely unregulated space, offering users decentralized lending, borrowing and trading without traditional banks. However, this freedom led to fraud, exploitation and regulatory scrutiny. In 2025, the regulatory landscape for DeFi experienced a seismic shift. The Trump administration adopted a crypto-friendly stance, repealing the IRS's controversial DeFi broker rule and signaling a more supportive approach to digital assets. This decision has created a more favorable environment for DeFi in the U.S., allowing protocols to operate without being treated like traditional brokerages. Because of the newly implemented regulatory clarity, investor interest in DeFi is soaring. EY reported that the number of investors engaging with DeFi is expected to triple over the next two years, rising from 24% to 75%. This growth reflects the sector's appeal as a way to access financial services without traditional intermediaries. As 2025 continues, the real test for DeFi will be how it balances innovation with compliance, ensuring both user protection and continued growth. Secondary bitcoin investments are gaining momentum in 2025 as companies and institutional investors seek new ways to gain indirect exposure to bitcoin. These secondary investments include bitcoin exchange-traded funds, futures and even bitcoin-backed bonds. With regulatory clarity improving, these products offer a more accessible way for investors to tap into Bitcoin’s potential without dealing with self-custody complexities. The trend is fueled by growing interest from corporate treasurers who view bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset. Companies like Strategy, Block, and Semler Scientific have added bitcoin to their balance sheets, using it as a hedge against inflation and a tool for long-term value preservation. The Financial Accounting Standards Board also updated its guidelines in December 2023, allowing companies to report bitcoin using fair value accounting, making it easier to show bitcoin’s actual value on financial statements. The appeal of secondary bitcoin investments is clear. These products offer exposure to bitcoin’s price growth without the risks of direct ownership. Public companies have already purchased 3.3 times more bitcoin in 2025 than the total new supply mined this year, highlighting the demand. As more firms explore bitcoin as a strategic asset, the market for bitcoin secondary investments is expected to grow rapidly, providing new opportunities for both corporate and retail investors. Tokenization of real world assets (RWA) is already trending in 2025, transforming how traditional assets like real estate, commodities, stocks and bonds are managed and traded. By representing these assets as digital tokens on blockchain networks, tokenization eliminates the need for paperwork, reduces transaction costs and increases accessibility for investors. Assets that were once illiquid, like private real estate, can now be easily bought, sold or fractionally owned by a global audience. This trend is gaining momentum as major financial institutions like BlackRock, Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan embrace RWA tokenization. Analysts at VanEck project that the RWA market could exceed $50 billion by the end of 2025, with potential growth to $10 trillion by 2030. As regulatory clarity improves and more investors seek efficient, blockchain-powered ways to access traditional assets, RWA tokenization is set to become a foundational part of the digital economy. Bottom Line The second half of 2025 is set to reshape the crypto industry with key trends like stablecoins, DeFi, secondary Bitcoin investments, AI-powered blockchain and RWA tokenization. As regulatory clarity improves and major players enter the space, these developments transform how digital assets are used, traded and integrated into the financial system. Investors should watch for growing institutional interest, expanding use cases, and evolving regulations that could drive market growth. Whether decentralized finance is adapting to new rules, bitcoin is gaining traction as a treasury asset or tokenized real-world assets are creating new investment opportunities, the crypto landscape is becoming more dynamic and accessible. The biggest trend in crypto for the second half of 2025 is the continued evolution of blockchain technology, with growing adoption in areas like decentralized finance (DeFi), stablecoins and the tokenization of traditional assets. Yes, AI is already impacting crypto trading by providing advanced data analysis, automated trading strategies and predictive market insights. As AI technology improves, it is expected to make trading faster, more accurate and accessible to a wider range of investors. Investors should watch for regulatory changes, the continued rise of RWA tokenization and the impact of AI on blockchain and crypto trading. Keeping an eye on institutional adoption and new Bitcoin investment products will also be crucial. Meme coins are still relevant, but their popularity has shifted toward niche communities and short-term speculation. Most meme coins lack real utility and often do not retain long-term value.

Title: Investors Pour $2.75 Billion Into Bitcoin ETFs As Price Skyrockets

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Spot Bitcoin ETFs ripped in $2.75 billion this week, and that haul was nearly 4.5 times last week’s $608 million. Prices jumped past $109,000, a high not seen since January. Bitcoin even touched $111,980 on May 22. Investors piled in as the rally took hold. According to Farside data, spot Bitcoin ETFs drew $2.75 billion this week, up sharply from $608 million the week before. That big jump came as Bitcoin pushed past its January all-time high of $109,000. On May 21, investors added $607 million, the same day Bitcoin hit a new peak. Then, on May 22, the coin soared to $111,980. Those moves show money chasing fresh highs. Based on reports, ETF flows on May 23 totaled just $212 million, but BlackRock’s IBIT was the only one in the green. It brought in $431 million all by itself, and that stretched its inflow streak to eight days straight. Meanwhile, Grayscale’s GBTC saw $89 million leave, and ARK 21Shares’ ARKB lost $74 million. Investors seem to favor the low fees and wide reach of the biggest funds. Bitcoin’s climb paused a bit after that. At publication, it traded near $108,150. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index slid from an “Extreme Greed” reading of 78 down to 66, or “Greed.” That dip hints at some profit-taking. CryptoQuant analyst Crypto Dan said on May 22 that “overheating indicators such as the funding rate and short-term capital inflow remain low compared to previous peaks, and profit-taking by short-term investors is limited.” His view is that this rally hasn’t been driven by risky bets. So far in May, spot Bitcoin ETFs have pulled in about $5.40 billion. The previous monthly high came in November 2024, when ETFs took in $6.50 billion. With five trading days left in May, inflows could set a new mark. That steady demand underlines how ETFs have become the go-to way for many to own Bitcoin without wrestling with wallets and private keys. Demand for spot Bitcoin ETFs has grown fast. Investors like simple, regulated products. The big issuers, led by BlackRock, have the best chance to stay on top. As for Bitcoin itself, if sentiment cools, prices might pull back some. But with institutional flows so strong, many see room to run higher. Featured image from Gemini Imagen, chart from TradingView They say journalists never truly clock out.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Title: How To Use Gold And Other Hard Assets To Hedge Against Inflation
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/baldwin/2025/05/24/gold-and-commodity-funds-19-best-buys/
Time Published: 2025-05-24T10:30:00Z
Full Content:
ByWilliam Baldwin ByWilliam Baldwin, Senior Contributor. Budget deficits are going to be insane. Moody’s belatedly admits that the U.S. Treasury is a questionable debtor. God knows what new surprises are coming from Washington. What about having a commodity as an inflation hedge? Gold is hot, oil is not. You could own a bullion fund (up 79% over the past three years), or you might feel safer diversifying your risks with a commodity futures fund. Such a fund holds derivatives tied to the prices of a basket of physical assets—crude oil, natural gas, precious metals, base metals, grains, livestock. This survey covers commodity funds, both those that own bars of precious metals and those that hold derivatives. Debate rages about whether commodities have any legitimate role for a long-term investor. Allan Roth, a financial advisor well known to Forbes readers, says commodity futures are a zero-sum game and therefore pointless. “In the aggregate, not a penny has ever been made in the futures market before costs,” he opines in a recent essay. AQR, a big money manager and also a profilee here, has an ax to grind; it sells a commodity futures fund. Its view: “The evidence supports commodities as a potentially attractive asset class in portfolios of stocks and bonds.” We will return to the debate about the desirability of owning contracts on crude oil, pigs and whatnot. But first, on the assumption that you have already decided to allocate some assets to the category, here is the roster of Best Buys. They are not particularly cheap in comparison to stock funds, but they are, in expense ratios, at the low end of what’s available for hard assets. All but the one from Vanguard are exchange-traded. Are broad-based commodity portfolios a good investment? They have their moments of glory. They did wonderfully well during the rising inflation of the 1970s. They zoomed during the first two years of the pandemic. In the past three years the diversified commodity funds have disappointed, utterly failing to keep up with inflation, although the narrow subcategory of precious metals has done well. Allan Roth is correct that futures trading is a zero-sum game. If you are long December Pork Cutouts on the CME, someone else is short, and the combined profit and loss on the hogs is $0. But there are two reasons why investors who are on the long side of commodities could make money over time. One has to do with hoarding, the other with production risks. Hoarding explains the price of gold. Some of this stuff is used in jewelry and electronics, but the marginal buyer is stockpiling it to preserve wealth. Over the past century the price of gold has raced at a 2.2% average annual rate above inflation. Stocks did a lot better, but it has to be conceded that gold has preserved wealth. The other driver of commodity futures relates to production. Corn for September delivery is now trading at $4.37 a bushel. It could be that the best estimate of what its spot price will be in September is $4.47, and that a farmer is willing to sell now for less because his production cost is $3.50 and he wants to take no chance of losing money. The speculator on the long side of the future expects a dime of profit for taking on the price risk. Oil’s price reflects both hoarding and hedging. Since it doesn’t spoil if left in the ground, it’s an asset to hoard. At the same time, producers need to cover their costs. If an offshore platform runs $1 billion, it might make sense for the company financing it to sell futures, even at a price below what’s expected. Buyers, of course, also hedge, going the other way. This is a complicated market. How much juice do you get from commodities? Matthew Jiannino, a quantitative expert at Vanguard, says they have a tendency to move five to seven times as fast (in the opposite direction) as an average bond. That is, you could reasonably pair a $100,000 commodities position with a $500,000 bond portfolio. But he is quick to add that the relationship is not predictable. There are times when both bonds and commodities are sinking. So, should you own a commodity fund? To answer, I can offer only some speculative thoughts. (A) Commodities present an interesting but unreliable hedge against inflation. (B) They will generate a real return over the next century that will be positive but not as good as the return on stocks. (C) The returns on actively managed commodity futures portfolios will collectively be, before expenses, no better than the return on a commodity index, and after expenses worse. The funds on our Best Buy list are priced at 0.4% of assets annually or less. Most of them are managed passively. But even the vendors of index funds sometimes can’t resist adding a little oomph. Thus, we have the iShares Bloomberg Roll Select Commodity Strategy fund, which tracks an index that contains the commodity contracts with the most favorable rolls. Rolling is the process of replacing an expiring contract with a later-dated one. Sometimes the new contract is priced lower than the old one, a phenomenon called backwardation. The reverse, typical for gold, is contango. In its prospectus for the fund, BlackRock informs us: “The underlying Index seeks to employ a positive carry strategy that emphasizes commodities and futures contract months with the greatest degree of backwardation and lowest degree of contango, resulting in net gains through positive roll returns.” A question to ask: If this fund is buying only the good contracts, who’s buying the bad ones? The fund, at any rate, is not a stellar performer. If you do put money into commodities, pay attention to expense ratios. Go beyond the cheapest only to get a specialty you really want (like industrial metals) or to get more liquidity. Note: The table is sortable on any column. One other admonition: Hold one of the diversified commodity funds on the table only in an IRA. They are all set up as K-1-free funds, which are deadly in a taxable account. Reason for this: One tax law says that the usual kind of investment company can’t own commodity futures directly. So it holds them in an offshore holding company, often getting commodity exposure via derivatives sold by investment banks. Then another tax law comes into play. This one says that offshore holding companies are wicked and should be penalized. Here’s how the punitive tax regime works: Gains on the derivatives are taxed as ordinary income, while losses can’t be passed through to the investor and can’t be carried forward by the fund. So you could be whipsawed, losing money one year, making it back to breakeven the next, yet have to pay income tax on an imaginary profit. If you had put $100,000 into the Vanguard Commodity Strategy Fund three years ago and reinvested all dividends, you’d now have $91,640. If you made the mistake of holding it in a taxable account, you would have had to declare $14,730 of ordinary income along the way. The Invesco DB Commodity Index Tracking Fund is organized differently, as a partnership (with a K-1 tax form). Losses from it can be carried forward, and profits are taxed as a mix of Treasury interest and long- and short-term capital gains. The Invesco partnership doesn’t make the Best Buy list because it costs a nondeductible 0.87% annually. In Invesco’s defense, it should be noted that this fee covers the salaries of traders who juggle the futures contracts, taking care not to overlook an expiration and have a carload of live cattle delivered to their offices. In a K-1-free fund, these trading costs are incorporated in the derivatives purchased from banks. Vanguard’s latest financial filing says it was paying an annual 0.13% for help from banks, making the total cost of money management 0.29%. The gold funds aren’t as bad as diversified K-1-free funds at tax time. When you sell, you pay capital gain tax at the “collectibles” rate (a federal maximum of 31.8%, including the investment income tax). There’s no whipsawing, there are no dividends to declare and there is the possibility that you will hold forever and get a step-up at death. Gold hoarding is comparatively cheap, as low as 0.1% annually.

Title: Market Meltdown and Recession Incoming, Warns Former BlackRock Fund Manager Edward Dowd

A former BlackRock fund manager just issued a major warning on the US economy. In a new interview on Market Disruptors, Edward Dowd forecasts an incoming recession and market meltdown driven in part by a housing crisis and a bursting AI bubble. Dowd points to collapsing new home permits since 2022 and falling tenant rents as early signs of a housing crash. He also warns that government spending cuts and a slowdown in illegal immigration will sap economic growth, with stock markets facing a potential 50% drop based on historical patterns. “The idea here is you have a recession that we think manifests itself pretty soon, and the stock markets bottom sometime in the first quarter of 2026. Then you have a recovery, that’s the ideal situation… We’re not claiming anything’s going to go systemic. We’re not doom and gloom. It’s just we think it’s an old-fashioned deep recession and hopefully it’s quick. Typically speaking in recessions like in the dot-com recession and the great financial crisis, stocks went down 50% before they recovered, so we’re nowhere near down 50% yet and we think that’s coming.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped from its all-time high of 45,073 in December of 2024 to a low of 38,314 last month, registering a 15% decline. Dowd traces the crisis to a global debt problem, temporarily masked by COVID-era money printing and spending, with commercial real estate and rising auto loan delinquencies signaling a broader credit crunch. In the long run, he expects deflationary pressures to force the Federal Reserve to slash rates and print money. For protection, Dowd advocates holding cash, pointing to Berkshire Hathaway’s massive position in T-bills/bonds, as well as physical gold, while cautioning against Bitcoin’s volatility and historic correlation with risk assets.

The world's most viewed site on global warming and climate change From THE DAILY CALLER Audrey StrebContributor The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Department of Justice (DOJ) threw their weight behind an antitrust lawsuit against major asset managers that alleges the firms colluded to tank coal production with their embrace of zero-emissions goals on Thursday morning. The lawsuit, led by Paxton and backed by ten other state attorneys general, alleges that BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street collusively used their market power to suppress coal production, thereby burdening consumers by causing the price of coal to skyrocket. The Trump FTC and the DOJ filed a statement of interest on Thursday supporting the attorneys general’s lawsuit, signaling the administration’s view that the firms’ so-called “environmental, social and corporate governance” (ESG) investing may fall afoul of antitrust law. “These companies allegedly blocked the production of American coal in the name of climate change scaremongering, all so they could take money out of the pockets of American consumers and put it in theirs,” Ferguson continued. The FTC and DOJ are taking action following Trump’s day-one energy emergency declaration and his April 8 executive order, which directed federal agencies to “encourage and support our Nation’s coal industry to increase our energy supply, lower electricity costs, stabilize our grid, create high-paying jobs, support burgeoning industries, and assist our allies.” “The President has declared a national energy emergency, and we need competition in coal production now more than ever to help fuel American energy dominance,” said Assistant Attorney General Abigail A. Slater of the DOJ’s Antitrust Division. “American consumers suffer when institutional asset managers use shareholdings in competing companies to orchestrate output reductions.” BlackRock, State Street and Vanguard are three of the world’s largest asset managers. All three were members of the Net Zero Asset Managers (NZAM) initiative until Vanguard dropped out in December 2022 and BlackRock exited the coalition in January. The DOJ and FTC’s “support for this baseless case undermines the Trump Administration’s goal of American energy independence,” a BlackRock spokesperson wrote to the Daily Caller News Foundation. “As we made clear in our earlier motion to dismiss, this case is trying to re-write antitrust law and is based on an absurd theory that coal companies conspired with their shareholders to reduce coal production. Forcing asset managers to divest from coal companies will harm their ability to access capital and invest in their businesses and employees, likely leading to higher energy prices.” “These asset managers, which have been acting as an ESG climate cartel have not only deceived investors but also harmed millions of American families by raising costs and contributing to record inflation,” executive director of Consumers’ Research Will Hild wrote to the DCNF. “Not only does the FTC and DOJ agree that the investments made were driven by a radical, political objective, but go directly against President Trump’s energy goals.” The White House, the FTC, Paxton’s office, Vanguard and State Street did not respond to the DCNF’s requests for comment.

I am really surprised at Vanguard for taking part, but they apparently realized their mistake in ’22. Punishing them now, after the fact seems pointless. The case should be thrown out. If a thief stops stealing, should they escape punishment for their earlier crimes? False equivalence. If they ran afoul of their fiduciary duty they must pay a price. It would be a deterrent if nothing else. You cannot let something like this slide. By your logic, no sports team would ever pay a price for cheating if it were uncovered after the season ended. It’s about time. This video, while humorous, highlights just how fraudulent this “science” truly is. https://app.screencast.com/DFd1viHxsRjq7 More people and corporations have to start punching back and expose the fraud. Here is another one the totally debunks the “Science” https://youtu.be/ZUVqZKBMF7o?si=6AjzotZdhfxkEKh_ CO2 IS AN ABSOLUTELY VITAL GAS/INGREDIENT FOR GROWING FLORA AND FAUNA; NET ZERO IS A SUICIDE PACT https://www.windtaskforce.org/profiles/blogs/co2-is-an-absolutely-vital-gas-ingredient-for-growing-flora-and . The IPCC, etc., has dubbed CO2 as having magical global warming power, based on its own “science” The IPCC, etc., claims, CO2 acts as Climate Control Knob, that eventually will cause runaway Climate Change, if we continue using fossil fuels. CO2, just 0.042% in the atmosphere, is a weak absorber of a small fraction of the available low-energy IR photons. CO2 has near-zero influence on world surface temperatures. . Governments proclaimed: Go Wind and Solar, Go ENERGIEWENDE, go Net zero by 2050, etc., and provided oodles of subsidies, and rules and regulations, and mandates, and prohibitions to make it happen. . MAGA and burn, baby, burn, may lead to a slightly greater CO2 ppm in atmosphere, which is an absolutely essential ingredient for creating: 1) increased green flora to support abundant fauna all over the world, and 2) increased crop yields to feed 8 billion people. What is not to like? . The slogan Net-zero by 2050 to-reduce CO2 is a super-expensive suicide pact, to increase command/control by governments, and enable the moneyed elites to get richer, at the expense of all others, by using the foghorn of the government-subsidized/controlled Corporate Media to spread scare-mongering slogans and brainwash people. . They deny the Little Ice Age, support fraudulent computer temperature projections, and are using the USAID-subsidized Corporate Media to scare-monger/control/brainwash the people, already for 35 years . At about 30% annual W/S electricity on the grid, various costs increase exponentially. The weather-dependent, variable/intermittent W/S output, often too-little and often too-much, creates grid-disturbing difficulties that become increasingly more challenging and increasingly more costly/kWh to counteract, as proven by the UK and California for the past 5 years, and Germany for the past 10 years, and recently in Spain/Portugal. . All four have “achieved” near-zero, real- growth GDPs, the highest electricity prices/kWh in the EU, and stagnant real wages for almost all people, while further enriching the jet-setting elites who live in the poshest places. . Their angry, over-taxed, over-regulated native populations are further burdened by the elites bringing in tens of millions of uninvited, unvetted, uneducated, inexperienced poor folks from all over; a chaotic, culture-clashing burden the native populations never voted for. . All that W/S subsidy money uglified the countryside, killed fisheries, tourism, viewsheds, etc. But the climate is not any different, even though, atmosphere CO2 increased from 280 ppm in 1850 to 420 ppm in 2025, 50% in 175 years. During that time, world surface temps increased by about 1.5 C, of which: . 1) Urban heat islands account for about 65% (0.65 x 1.5 = 0.975 C), such as about 700 miles from north of Portland, Maine, to south of Norfolk, Virginia, forested in 1850, now covered with heat-absorbing human detritus, plus the waste heat of fuel burning. Japan, China, India, Europe, etc., have similar heat islands https://wattsupwiththat.com/2025/05/16/live-at-1-p-m-eastern-shock-climate-report-urban-heat-islands-responsible-for-65-of-global-warming/ 2) CO2 accounts for at most 0.5 C, with the rest from 3) Long-term, inter-acting cycles, such as coming out of the Little Ice Age, 4) Earth surface volcanic activity, and other changes, such as from increased agriculture, deforestation, especially in the Tropics, etc. THE UK, GERMANY, SPAIN, FRANCE, DENMARK, ETC., ARE IN DEEP DO-DO, BECAUSE WIND/SOLAR SYSTEMS PROVIDE ZERO SYNCHRONOUS INERTIA TO THE GRID https://www.windtaskforce.org/profiles/blogs/the-uk-germany-spain-france-etc-in-deep-wind-solar-do-do . The UK Conservative and Labor elites, using the foghorn of the government-subsidized/controlled Corporate Media, brainwashed the people to vote for them for decades. Those voters ended up having the highest electric bills, i.e., total bill divided by consumed electricity, c/kWh, while the elite Owners are laughing all the way to the bank. . Any energy systems analyst would know Spain/Portugal-like blackout problems would eventually happen, before a single wind/solar system were connected to the grid, but naive, woke, technically illiterate enviros do not want to listen to the pros. Full speed ahead over the cliff, unless all this wind/solar/battery nonsense is stopped dead by taking away the overly generous subsidies. . Expensive Wind and Solar Systems The over-taxed, over-regulated taxpayers and ratepayers are paying at very high c/kWh for electricity and Heat Pump heating/cooling and for EV driving. . They pay for: . 1) highly subsidized, expensive wind/solar systems that disturb the grid with weather-dependent, variable, intermittent electricity, which has caused expensive brownouts/blackouts, as in Spain/Portugal, and many other places, over the years. 2) grid expansion to connect all these far-flung wind/solar systems to the grid, 3) grid reinforcements to ensure the grids do not crash during periods with higher levels of wind/solar power . In cases of too much wind/solar power, it needs to be curtailed; Owners still get paid for what they could have produced. In cases of too little wind/solar power, traditional plants need to increase outputs to meet demand, 24/7/365. Synchronous Inertia Serves to Stabilize the Grid Closing down traditional plants (nuclear, gas, coal, hydro), with rotating generators that provide SYNCHRONOUS inertia, de-stabilizes the grid; a death sentence for the grid. . Wind/solar systems provide ZERO SYNCHRONOUS inertia to help stabilize the grid, because their variable outputs are digitized, then reconstituted into an artificial sine wave with the same phase and frequency as the grid. . Connections Between Grids Almost all grids have connections to other grids for import and export purposes. Such connections usually are high-voltage, direct-current lines, HVDC Such connections transfer power, but do not transfer SYNCHRONOUS inertia to other grids. . Reactive Power No AC grid can function without positive reactive power; power factor greater than zero. Wind/solar systems take reactive power FROM the grid; power factor less than zero All traditional power plants are automatically set up to provide reactive power TO the grid . Synchronous Condenser Systems The weather-dependent, variable/intermittent, wind/solar feed-ins to the grid often create transmission faults. Those faults are often minimized with synchronous condenser systems that provide positive reactive power TO the grid. . Net Zero to reduce CO2 by 2050 is a very expensive suicide pact. We need higher CO2 ppm in the atmosphere for increased greening of the world, to support abundant fauna, and to increase crop yields to feed 8 billion people. The minor little problem is that the asset managers were reacting to “jawboning” by politicians. Of course, the managers backed that same political party in their folly, but the real target are the Green Blob politicians the managers were sucking up to. It would be more honest to charge various politicians with outsourcing their Green ambitions unconstitutionally. Conspiracy to commit extortion? The man who lead the UN initiative called NZAM is now the Prime Minister of Canada. A fact which gets zero coverage in the Canadian media and the conservatives failed to make an issue of during the election. The man who tried to shut down Canada’s O&G industry through the global financial system is now in a position to do more harm than he possibly could have at the UN. The only thing staying his hand is the threat of Alberta and Saskatchewan separating. Very nice. I have money invested in Vanguard index funds. “… until Vanguard dropped out in December 2022 …” Go to that link and read the statement and then explain what Vanguard did wrong. At the time I told my advisor to NOT put any of my money in an ESG fund — I did not know if they had one, then, or now. I doubt that my instruction had any influence – me being a relatively small $$ investor. However, the Total Stock Market fund invests in “ approximately 100% of the investable U.S. stock market and includes large-, mid-, small-, and micro-cap stocks” so it is likely there were a few ESG companies in my portfolio. There is nothing I could/can do about that and follow the guidance to diversify.

Title: Oracle to Buy $40 Billion Worth of Nvidia Chips for First Stargate Data Center

Oracle will reportedly buy $40 billion worth of Nvidia’s chips to power the first Stargate project, a new data center in Abilene, Texas. The company will buy 400,000 of Nvidia’s latest “superchips” for training and running artificial intelligence (AI) systems, the GB200 chips, and lease the computing power they provide to OpenAI, the Financial Times (FT) reported Friday (May 23). The data center is expected to be fully operational by the middle of 2026 and will be one of the largest data centers in the world, providing 1.2 gigawatts of power, according to the report. President Donald Trump announced Stargate in January, saying the up-to-$500 billion project aims to build big AI-focused data centers in the U.S., with the first 10 being in Texas. Oracle, OpenAI, SoftBank and MGX are equity partners in Stargate, while Oracle, Arm, Microsoft, Nvidia and OpenAI will be the project’s initial technology partners. It was reported Wednesday (May 21) that the Abilene data center had secured $11.6 billion in funding commitments and that the funding would expand the data center to eight buildings from two and bring the total amount secured for the project to $15 billion. AI data centers are needed because traditional data centers and power grids are struggling to accommodate the intense computational power, data storage and energy required by AI, PYMNTS reported in January. “AI data centers are fundamentally different because they require specialized hardware and infrastructure to handle the massive parallel processing needed for AI workloads,” Deborah Perry Piscione, co-founder of Work3 Institute, an AI and Web3 advisory firm, told PYMNTS in January. “Traditional data centers focus on storage and basic compute, while AI facilities need dense configurations of GPUs and AI accelerators, like Nvidia’s H100s, designed specifically for the complex matrix calculations that power AI models,” she added. In March, Elon Musk’s xAI and Nvidia joined the $30 billion AI Infrastructure Fund backed by BlackRock, Microsoft and MGX. The Fund’s ultimate goal is to raise up to $100 billion for AI development. Microsoft and BlackRock launched the fund last year, aiming to raise money to construct data centers and find sources of power for those facilities.

BlackRock's IBIT accumulates $8 billion in five weeks amid Bitcoin price momentum. BlackRock’s IBIT topped all US-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in inflows on May 22 following Bitcoin’s rally to a new all-time high above $110,000. On May 23, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas reported that IBIT attracted $877.18 million in inflows that day, outpacing traditional heavyweights like Vanguard’s VOO, which tracks the S&P 500. VOO, typically a market leader, only saw $558 million in inflows, placing fifth on the day. Before this milestone, Balchunas had observed that IBIT posted its “second biggest volume day ever” on May 21. He noted that this trend was also observed in other Bitcoin ETF products, which had seen above-average volume thanks to the growing institutional interest in BTC, with investors piling into crypto-related funds during the price surge. Balchunas said: “All the BTC ETFs are elevated, most gonna see 2x their [daily] average. Flows incoming.” The cumulative impact of these gains has been substantial. Lifetime net inflows into all Bitcoin ETFs have now surpassed $44.5 billion, which illustrates the growing demand for regulated crypto investment vehicles. BlackRock’s IBIT has been a standout performer among these products, adding approximately $8 billion over the last five weeks alone. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

How does Kraken plan to blend 55+ tokenized stocks with Solana’s DeFi apps for seamless trading? Kraken is pushing the boundaries of traditional finance by introducing 24/7 trading for tokenized U.S. equities, granting global investors round-the-clock access to leading stocks like Apple, Tesla, and Nvidia. This move also highlights how Kraken is advancing its platform following years of legal challenges with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In a statement, Kraken outlined, “Thrilled to unveil xStocks, a new line of over 55 tokenized stocks and ETFs, set to launch soon on Kraken and integrated with Solana’s best DeFi apps.” The new service, called xStocks, will be launched in the coming weeks, and will be offering tokenized versions of over 50 stocks and ETFs. This platform will be accessible to users in Europe, Latin America, Africa, and Asia, providing 24/7 trading similar to Bitcoin [BTC]. By delivering traditional equities in a crypto-native format, Kraken aims to offer continuous market access outside the U.S., where it already operates a conventional stock trading platform with more than 11,000 stocks and ETFs. The firm detailed, “It follows our recent rollout of equities trading for U.S. clients, giving millions of Americans access to over 11,000 U.S.-listed stocks and ETFs directly within the Kraken app. We’re planning to expand that offering to clients in the U.K., Europe and Australia soon.” Under President Donald Trump, the SEC eased many crypto-related lawsuits, including those against Kraken. While Binance [BNB] briefly explored equity tokenization in 2021, but halted due to regulatory pressure, the current climate is shifting. Therefore, with growing support from U.S. lawmakers and major players like Robinhood and BlackRock entering the tokenization space, Kraken is seizing the opportunity to advance its vision in this evolving market.

Title: DOJ, FTC Side Against Largest Asset Managers in ESG-Related Coal Suit
URL: https://www.ai-cio.com/news/doj-ftc-side-against-largest-asset-managers-in-esg-related-coal-suit/

On Thursday, the Department of Justice and the U.S. Federal Trade Commission filed a statement of interest supporting a complaint which alleges BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street conspired to suppress the coal market. In November 2024, 13 state attorneys general, led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, filed a complaint, Texas et. al. v. BlackRock Inc., State Street Corp., and The Vanguard Group, against the three asset managers, alleging they conspired to suppress coal production in the United States and drive up the price of the commodity. According to the complaint, the three asset managers used their holdings in U.S. coal companies to pressure those companies to adopt environmental, social and governance targets. The complaint highlights these managers’ membership of organizations like Climate Action 100+ and the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, which both called for achieving net-zero investment portfolios. The complaint also alleges that the managers achieved “supra-competitive” profits by decreasing coal output and increasing prices. It also alleges the asset managers violated the Clayton Act, which prohibits the acquisition of minority stakes in companies to lessen competition. For more stories like this, sign up for the CIO Alert newsletter.  “The President has declared a national energy emergency, and we need competition in coal production now more than ever to help fuel American energy dominance,” said U.S. Assistant Attorney General Abigail A. Slater in a statement, referencing President Donald Trump’s Executive Order 14156, which declared a national energy emergency, and Executive Order 14261, which called for an increase in domestic energy production, including coal. “As the Supreme Court has held, ‘social justifications’ for anticompetitive conduct ‘do not make it any less unlawful,’” Slater continued in the statement. “We will not hesitate to stand up against powerful financial firms that use Americans’ retirement savings to harm competition under the guise of ESG.” BlackRock and State Street were signatories of Climate Action 100+ but later withdrew, while Vanguard was never a signatory. All three firms were, at one point, signatories of the Net Zero Asset Manager Initiative, which paused operations in January, following BlackRock’s exit from the organization. The three asset managers are the largest shareholders in all nine publicly listed U.S. coal companies, which comprise half of U.S. coal output, according to the statement of interest. The three managers are accused of engaging with the management of these companies to lower their carbon emissions by restricting coal production. In a statement, BlackRock denied the allegations: “The DOJ and FTC’s support for this baseless case undermines the Trump administration’s goal of American energy independence,” BlackRock stated. “As we made clear in our earlier motion to dismiss, this case is trying to re-write antitrust law and is based on an absurd theory that coal companies conspired with their shareholders to reduce coal production.” State Street called the lawsuit “baseless”: “State Street Global Advisors acts in the long-term financial interests of investors with a focus on enhancing shareholder value,” State Street stated. “As long-term capital providers, we have a mutual interest in the long-term success of our portfolio companies. This lawsuit is baseless, and we look forward to presenting the facts through the legal process. Additional filings do not change our assessment.” Vanguard responded that it acted lawfully: “Though we have concerns with many of the legal interpretations promoted by the agencies, Vanguard appreciates their explicit acknowledgement that the antitrust laws allow these three things: ‘passive fund investing,’ ‘shareholder advocacy for better corporate governance’ and ‘active investing that doesn’t harm competition,’ a Vanguard spokesperson said. “The facts show Vanguard has stayed well within this construct.” The Investment Company Institute, which represents regulated investment fund companies, stated Thursday that the federal intervention in the case could harm, rather than help, investment in coal companies. “Fund investments are invaluable in providing capital formation for American coal, oil, and gas companies,” the ICI stated. “Billions upon billions of dollars are invested by asset managers today on behalf of their clients to make the U.S. energy industry the best in the world both … like President Trump wants. The case the federal government is now weighing in on seeks to attack minority investors for decisions they believe are in the best interest of fund shareholders. The relief suggested by the plaintiffs would devastate funds, investors, and the energy industry itself. “ Related Stories: House Republicans Characterize ESG as an Anti-Trust Cartel Republican AGs File Suit Against Asset Managers Alleging Coal Repression Scheme Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative Pauses Activities Following BlackRock Exit Tags: BlackRock, Department of Justice, DoJ, State Street, Vanguard « The Market Is Not Melting Down—It’s Moving Forward

Title: Trump relishes uttering the outlandish. Here’s where some of his most showstopping comments stand
URL: https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/05/23/trump-tracking-showstopping-comments/
Time Published: 2025-05-23T16:02:17Z

By WILL WEISSERT, Associated Press WASHINGTON (AP) — It may start as a casual aside, a wee-hours social post or a much-hyped announcement. Whatever the delivery mechanism, President Donald Trump loves to toss out startling ideas aimed at dropping jaws, commandeering headlines and bolstering his political brand. Never in modern times has a president offered so many off-the-cuff statements with such a potential for wide, even global, impact. His sometimes implausible notions may become reality, or — through repetition — no longer sound so outlandish. At other times, Trump just moves on, either by fashioning a rhetorical off-ramp or finding a way to declare victory. Some ideas, though, just seem to fade away. Here’s a look at some of Trump’s showstopping utterances this term and where they stand. WHERE IT STANDS: Moving ahead. BACKSTORY: Trump has embraced the idea of getting a $400 million luxury plane as a gift from oil-rich Qatar for the U.S. to use as Air Force One until Boeing delivers long-delayed new planes to the government. The Pentagon said Wednesday it has accepted the jet for use as Air Force One, but retrofitting the plane to meet security requirements will be costly and take time. And ethics experts, Democrats, and even some conservatives have warned that accepting such a luxurious gift from a foreign government is unseemly and could violate constitutional provisions meant to avoid bribery. WHERE IT STANDS: In limbo. BACKSTORY: Trump posted on his social media site in early May that he wanted to reopen an “expanded and rebuilt” Alcatraz, the notorious former prison that has been closed for more than six decades — and he subsequently talked about it at the White House. The president hasn’t said much on the subject since, nor addressed how lengthy, difficult and costly such a reclamation project would be. William K. Marshall III, the director of the Bureau of Prisons, said he’s ordered an “assessment to determine our needs and the next steps,” even as California’s Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, dismissed the idea as a “distraction.” Some administration officials have endorsed bringing back the lockup known as “The Rock,” which operated from 1934 to 1963. Border czar Tom Homan suggested it could be used to house migrants awaiting deportation. WHERE IT STANDS: Still talking. BACKSTORY: Trump first floated this idea of the “Great State of Canada” with a December post just after midnight. When new Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney recently visited Trump at the White House, he made a point of saying that Canada “won’t be for sale, ever.” Trump responded, “never say never.” Carney said later that he told the president privately to quit talking about making Canada a state. He didn’t divulge Trump’s reaction, though, noting only that it was necessary to distinguish between “a wish and a reality.” Trump nonetheless insisted during the meeting that Canada joining the United States would be a “wonderful marriage.” WHERE IT STANDS: Still talking. BACKSTORY: Trump continues to insist that the U.S. could “get” Greenland, which is part of the kingdom of Denmark, despite Copenhagen saying that’s impossible. Vice President JD Vance visited Greenland in March for a quick stop at the U.S. military base there after island residents rejected a broader visit. During that trip, Vance scolded Denmark but acknowledged that Greenland would control its own sovereignty — while still suggesting that it may want to make a deal with the United States. WHERE IT STANDS: Political off-ramp found. BACKSTORY: Trump for months decried growing Chinese influence over the Panama Canal and even refused to rule out a U.S. invasion to retake control of the waterway. The situation appeared to simmer down when the White House hailed a nearly $23 billion deal announced in March that would sell two canal ports run by a company based in the Chinese territory of Hong Kong to investors led by the U.S. firm BlackRock. The deal has since hit regulatory snags, and has yet to be finalized. In the meantime, the U.S. signed an agreement giving its troops access to Panamanian facilities. WHERE IT STANDS: Faded away. BACKSTORY: Trump suggested in February that billionaire Elon Musk would be checking out Fort Knox in Kentucky to ensure that U.S. gold reserves were still there. Days later, the president said at a conservative conference outside Washington, “I’m going to go with Elon.” He then drew sustained applause by asking, “Would anybody like to join us?” Nothing has come of it since. WHERE IT STANDS: Losing steam. BACKSTORY: Trump has repeatedly floated the idea that the U.S. would “take over” war-torn Gaza and move out the Palestinians who live there. He even suggested that U.S. developers could turn the area into a “Riviera of the Middle East,” once the war between Israel and Hamas has concluded. The president at one point posted a fake video of himself and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sunbathing in Gaza and featuring a glitzy resort dubbed “TRUMP GAZA.” During his trip to the Mideast last week, Trump offered a different iteration of the idea, saying the U.S. could “get involved” in Gaza “and make it just a freedom zone.” The issue remains a nonstarter with Arab nations. WHERE IT STANDS: Still talking. BACKSTORY: Trump continues to suggest that an autopen was used to sign presidential pardons, legislation and other key documents during the tenure of former President Joe Biden. It’s an accusation designed to question his Democratic predecessor’s mental capacity and presidential authority. Trump’s repeated complaints about Biden’s autopen continue to get attention among some far-right media outlets and have prompted a Republican proposal in Congress to ban using autopens on presidential pardons. Trump has even suggested an investigation could be coming related to Biden signing immigration actions via autopen. “We’re going to start looking into this whole thing with who signed this legislation,” he said this week. WHERE IT STANDS: Faded away. BACKSTORY: Trump used his social media site in March to share a British media outlet’s suggestion that Britain’s King Charles III was making a “secret offer” to allow the United States to become an associate member of the British Commonwealth. “I love King Charles,” Trump wrote. “Sounds good to me!” Trump might have been joking, but his post sparked pushback online from supporters who roundly rejected the idea. He has not gone back to it. WHERE IT STANDS: Faded away. BACKSTORY: In February, Trump falsely labeled Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy a “dictator without elections” in the midst of Russia’s ongoing invasion of that country. Before Zelenskyy, who was elected Ukraine’s president in 2019, prior to Russia’s attack on Ukraine, subsequently visited the White House, Trump backed off, saying, “Did I say that?” Trump still finds plenty to complain about with the Ukrainian leader, though, saying last week that U.S. aid to the country has been “pissed away.” WHERE IT STANDS: Still talking. BACKSTORY: In February, Trump said his administration would begin offering $5 million “ gold cards ” that give “very high-level people” a “route to citizenship.” The cards would grant foreigners visas to live and work in the United States. In early April, he held up a gold card featuring his name and picture and said they would be available in “less than two weeks, probably.” The card still hasn’t gone on sale, but Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick recently told the All-In podcast that he’d already personally sold 1,000 of them. WHERE IT STANDS: Still talking — off and on. BACKSTORY: The Constitution’s 22nd Amendment states no one can be elected president “more than twice.” That hasn’t stopped Trump from talking about it — or the Trump Organization from selling “Trump 2028” gear, despite the president himself offering mixed signals. Asked about running for a third term during a recent NBC News interview, Trump replied, “I’m not looking at that.” But he added: “So many people want me to do it. I have never had requests so strong as that. But it’s something that, to the best of my knowledge, you’re not allowed to do. I don’t know if that’s constitutional.” That followed his saying in an interview with NBC News in March: “I’m not joking. There are methods which you could do it.” And he suggested to Time Magazine, “There are some loopholes.” Will Weissert covers the White House for The Associated Press.

Title: The Digital Asset Primer: Why Equity Markets Are Being Tokenized

Highlights Kraken is introducing xStocks, tokenized versions of over 50 equities on the Solana blockchain, aimed at underserved markets in Europe, Latin America, Africa and Asia. Tokenized equities are gaining traction as financial institutions explore blockchain for real-world assets, signaling a shift toward using public blockchains for regulated financial instruments. While tokenized equities offer greater accessibility and efficiency, they face regulatory uncertainty and concerns over market integrity without traditional financial oversight. It’s been over 15 years since the first bitcoin was minted. Now, cryptocurrency is making good on some of its promises to reshape centuries-old financial paradigms. The sector’s latest target? Equity markets. Crypto exchange Kraken is planning to offer tokenized versions of more than 50 stocks, including names like Apple, Tesla and Nvidia, along with exchange-traded funds (ETFs), showing that blockchain is increasingly maturing beyond its earlier history as a fringe innovation. Branded as xStocks, Kraken’s tokenized equities are digital representations of actual shares, made tradable on the Solana blockchain. The xStocks will only be available to customers in Europe, Latin America, Africa and Asia. This isn’t the first attempt at bridging crypto with traditional equities. Binance, for instance, flirted with tokenized stocks in 2021 before regulatory scrutiny forced a retreat. However, Kraken’s approach is more calculated and compliance-conscious, built on partnerships and a clear value proposition. The exchange aims to prove that blockchain technology can provide a key substrate upon which next-generation financial services can be built. Each xStock is backed 1-to-1 by actual shares, held through Kraken’s Swiss partner, Backed Finance. Investors can redeem the tokens for the cash equivalent of the underlying assets, reinforcing price parity and transparency, two pillars often absent in early blockchain experiments. See also: The CFO and Treasurer’s Guide to Digital Assets Kraken’s xStocks aren’t targeting American day traders or Wall Street veterans. Instead, they’re aimed at retail investors in emerging and underserved markets, an often-overlooked demographic. In countries with capital controls or limited brokerage services, investing in U.S. stocks typically involves high fees, delayed settlement times and bureaucratic entanglements. Kraken hopes to eliminate these traditional barriers by using the decentralized nature of blockchain to provide instant, 24/7 trading access — no matter the time zone or local economic constraints. The core innovation of tokenized equities lies in the use of blockchain infrastructure to issue and manage these assets. By using smart contracts and decentralized ledgers, tokenized equities offer advantages such as fractional ownership, 24/7 trading and greater global accessibility. For investors in countries with limited access to U.S. financial markets, tokenized stocks may present a compelling alternative. Kraken isn’t alone in its interest in tokenizing equities and other real-world assets onto the blockchain. “Banks are in the state where they are thinking about blockchains as public infrastructure that they need to rely on,” Chainalysis co-founder and CEO Jonathan Levin told PYMNTS. “Back in 2014 … cryptocurrency only meant blockchains that had native cryptocurrency tokens in April. “Today, people are putting all types of financial instruments on the blockchain,” he added. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said all assets should be tokenized on a blockchain and tradable online, writing in his 2025 annual shareholder letter: “Every stock, every bond, every fund — every asset — can be tokenized.” In March, BlackRock launched its first tokenized fund on the Ethereum blockchain, backed by short-term U.S. Treasurys. Meanwhile, R3 and Solana Foundation announced Thursday (May 22) that they have partnered to bring regulated real-world assets onto a public blockchain, while Visa, Mastercard, J.P. Morgan and other financial players are exploring or piloting real-world tokenized payment and financial systems. Read also: Crypto Firms Grapple With Bank-Like Risks, Without the Regulation However, the rise of tokenized equities is not without challenges. Chief among them are regulatory uncertainty and the risk inherent to crypto players moving into mainstream financial services without the same level of oversight as traditional financial institutions. Custody solutions also play a critical role. For tokenized equities to be credible, there must be transparent and secure custody of the underlying assets. Some platforms partner with licensed custodians to hold actual shares, while others use synthetic representations, raising questions about counterparty risk and asset backing. From a technological standpoint, tokenized equities rely on a mix of public and permissioned blockchains. Ethereum remains a popular choice due to its robust smart contract capabilities and liquidity in decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystems. However, scalability and gas fees have driven some platforms to alternative chains like Solana, Avalanche and Polygon. The growing adoption of tokenized equities also represents a potential disruption to traditional financial intermediaries. Brokers, clearinghouses and exchanges may find themselves disintermediated as blockchain-based systems streamline settlement and custody functions. Settlement times can shrink from T+2 to near-instantaneous, reducing counterparty risk and operational costs. This disintermediation, however, also raises concerns about market integrity and systemic risk. Without centralized oversight, questions about manipulation, insider trading and investor recourse become more pressing. Traditional finance’s emphasis on compliance and risk management remains a counterbalance.

Title: Terror in DC: Where We Go From Here. Plus, Suspected Israeli Embassy Shooter’s Ties to Woke Nonprofits.

Unheeded warnings: The shooting of two Israeli embassy staffers outside the Jewish museum in Washington, D.C., is not an isolated act—it’s the latest incident of left-wing, frequently anti-Israel radicalism that academic administrators and law enforcement officials have been treating with kid gloves, writes our Washington Free Beacon editors. "The 30-year-old assailant, steeped in the radical anti-Israel and anti-Western ideology in which our universities are awash, is just past college age. So were his two victims." Just one microcosm: Harvard never disciplined two graduate students charged with assaulting an Israeli classmate. Law enforcement let them off with community service and an anger management class. It’s an obvious precursor for what unfolded Wednesday evening, and "the domestic terrorism unleashed in the nation’s capital is just a foretaste of what we can expect if universities and law enforcement, both local and federal, don’t change their approach," the Beacon’s editors warn. "Americans of good conscience, including those in the federal government, can act now—pressing for the death penalty in this case and scrutinizing every group with which the perpetrator was affiliated—or live to regret it later." READ MORE: Terror in DC: Where We Go From Here Nonprofit but pro-Hamas: The man accused of Wednesday’s terrorist act worked until the middle of last year at a "nonpartisan" nonprofit funded by the Ford and MacArthur foundations, reports our Jessica Costescu and Jessica Schwalb. Elias Rodriguez, the left-wing activist who shouted "Free Palestine" before his arrest, was employed as a researcher at The HistoryMakers, a group that has received at least $1 million from the Ford Foundation since 2024 and partnered with PBS on public programming. The HistoryMakers, which claims to be "committed to preserving and making widely accessible the untold personal stories of both well-known and unsung African Americans," presents itself as a nonpartisan effort. But, as Costescu and Schwalb note, its work suggests a left-wing political bent, to say the least. "Clarence Thomas, the second black Supreme Court justice, is omitted, but Anita Hill, who accused him of sexual harassment, is included. The renowned economist Thomas Sowell is omitted, but Al Sharpton is present. Its biography of Nation of Islam chief Louis Farrakhan omits any mention of his long history of anti-Semitism, noting instead that he’s ‘at times a controversial figure’ who pushes a ‘message of a unified community,’" they write. Rodriguez also has a history of anti-Israel radicalism. An X account apparently tied to him promoted Hamas, shared calls for "Death To Israel" and "De@th 2 Amerikka," and praised "armed action" as "the only sane thing to do." He also previously belonged to the Chicago chapter of the Party for Socialism and Liberation, which frequently organizes anti-Israel protests. READ MORE: Suspected Israeli Embassy Shooter Worked for Woke Education Group Backed by Ford, MacArthur Foundations Trump targets ESG: The Trump administration is backing a lawsuit that accuses BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard of using their influence in the financial sector to distort energy markets and drive up costs for American consumers, reports our Thomas Catenacci. The Federal Trade Commission filed a brief Thursday in support of the suit, which claims the three asset management giants may have violated U.S. antitrust law by coordinating efforts to limit coal production through environmental, social, and governance (ESG) initiatives. The case, filed by 12 Republican-led states, alleges the asset managers used their substantial ownership stakes in major coal companies to push left-wing climate goals, including a 50 percent reduction in coal output by 2030. The FTC’s filing marks the first time the Trump administration has intervened in an ESG-related case. "Critics of the ESG movement say it seeks to improperly boost politically favored green industries that aren't profitable at the expense of more profitable energy industries. In doing so, they argue, ESG policies harm American investors—asset managers that have a legally mandated fiduciary duty to promote the wellbeing of clients whose money they manage," Catenacci writes.

Title: Wrong Again, Democrats: Paying “Influencers” Misses the Boat

Time Published: 2025-05-23T10:00:00Z

When I joined the race for Democratic National Committee chair a few months ago, there was one area of consensus among all the candidates—including the eventual victor, Ken Martin. One of the big lessons of the loss from the last election cycle was that we collectively spent too much money on TV and digital ads, driven in large part by decisions of well-placed and well-heeled Democratic consultants. We’re about to fall into the same trap in 2025. The new flavor of the moment, though, isn’t TV ads; it’s “influencers.” According to reporting in The New York Times, liberal donors are now planning to spend ungodly amounts on creating an “army of left-leaning” digital creators of all stripes and styles. Having realized that we’re outgunned by the right in both reach and scale of conversation online, we’re now doing what Democrats often resort to—spending money to try to solve the problem. This mindset masks a deeper issue: spending money to create content with no editorial vision or strategy. When we don’t have organic grassroots appeal and we are not sufficiently connected to huge numbers of real Americans, we paper over that problem by trying to pay to reach people in unidirectional ways (paid ads, paid influencers, paid organizers). We need to focus less on the pipes and tactics of contacting people and put more emphasis on the content vision and ideas of what people find authentically and organically engaging. The inputs into the Democratic Party’s elite have strayed from meaningful conversations that ordinary citizens find interesting. We’re losing in the attention economy, as MSNBC host Chris Hayes has written. I believe a big part of the reason for that is that Democrats aren’t talking about economic justice and class-based issues in compelling and interesting ways, at a time when those class-based problems are dominating the lives of everyday Americans in every possible way. These conversations are more likely to be heard on right-leaning podcasts than on left-leaning ones. But if we engage them, the conversations speak to the broadest ideological spectrum of Americans. I talk daily to candidates wanting to run for office, and I pose this simple question to them. If I dropped you into a random town hall in any city in America, and you didn’t know anything about who was in the room, what would you say to them in order to get them to agree with you? Many have no idea what they’d say; others want to pander to pablum about “Costs are high,” or “We need to rebuild the middle class,” or “Donald Trump is terrible.” The answer must start with the reality of what we are seeing in this economy. We know the basic story that connects with voters: Corporate CEOs, monopolists, and the passive-wealth-generating elites of America have rigged an economic and political system to prioritize their needs over ours. If we are to have any chance of creating better lives for future generations, we have to be willing to wrestle power back from them through working-class solidarity. And we need politicians who have the integrity, conviction, and knowledge to be unbought and unbossed by these powerful actors. But right now, we aren’t sufficiently grounded in the lived experience and language of working Americans, who expect leaders to understand the reality of their daily struggles and own the friction with established power. To earn credibility, we have to name the culprits who deprive them of liberty. We must elevate potential solutions to give people a serious chance at a secure retirement, health care, decent wages, housing, and education in an increasingly complex and rigged economy. The consulting and funding classes are still not sure what content people actually want to consume—because they have no ways of engaging organic feedback from regular people outside of paid polls and focus groups. The social listening inputs into the left-of-center architecture are broken. If I tell a leading Democratic strategist that I want to make an ad about three global asset management companies that would help explain how they’re profiting off the lives of working people, here’s what I’d expect to hear in response: “People don’t know what asset managers are.” “That’s too complicated of a topic!” “We need the financial industry’s donations and support, so this is counterproductive.” I could go on. This exact video about Blackrock and other asset managers is currently the most-watched video on More Perfect Union’s YouTube page, with 6.6 million views and counting, and finding great appeal with Trump voters. And it’s not an anomaly for us. We’re one of the fastest-growing digital media companies since the launch of Vox, and at a moment when there’s lots of ink being spilled about the right model for growing the Democratic voting base and winning back working-class Americans with compelling information, we think more funders and outlets could stand to learn from an approach that is already working in speaking to people beyond their politically polarized viewpoints. The current conversations playing out on the left about culture, authenticity, and influence are illuminating a central challenge for the Democratic Party in this political moment. We’ve been told versions of, “We need to be willing to go on Joe Rogan’s show!” or, “We need more Joe Rogans of our own!” or, my personal favorite, “We used to have Joe Rogan!” All of these are missing the point. Without speaking for Rogan, let me just suggest that most leading platforms and podcasters want depth of knowledge, integrity, and conviction from guests who have something meaningful to convey. In my view, Joe Rogan, Theo Von, Lex Fridman, Andrew Schulz, and so many other prominent online influencers have hosted and liked Bernie Sanders not because he chose to go on their programs—it’s because of what he had to say! Sanders has had the integrity and conviction to take on power with a meaningful message about the priorities and needs of regular people who are getting screwed—which happens to be compelling and interesting content for these shows, which the audiences want to hear more discussion about. The other side understands this proposition. The arguments that helped elect Donald Trump didn’t start in consulting offices in D.C. or at exclusive donor meetings, speculating about a cultural “vertical” to fill with poll-tested talking points. They started with the things Americans were saying to one another in their day-to-day lives—and what they were sharing in comments sections and everyday meetups. Keeping their ears to the ground, conservatives found people were fed up with masking mandates and were angry about school curricula deprioritizing basic math, English, and science skills in favor of other factors as students came back after missing a year. People were worried about the flow of illegal immigrants across the border, its impact on jobs, wages, and public investments. There were serious issues about public safety in our cities, amounting to threats to their way of life. The right created enemies in the out-of-control, out-of-touch, far-left politicians as they discussed these issues. That’s not to justify any of the right’s disinformation campaigns around these matters. But the feelings that their target audience had were real, and the people crafting the campaign’s messaging knew it. As a result, in political terms, populism largely exists on the right. But I also want populism of the left. We need movements to be connected to the emotions of real people at scale. It’s worth considering this: Would Bernie’s very successful “Fighting Oligarchy Tour”—the greatest, record-breaking-turnout events Democrats have put on this year—ever have happened if the consultant-driven language police had been in charge? They tell us, “It’s the economy, stupid.” They tell us, “It’s the authenticity, stupid.” Now, “It’s the influencers, stupid.” Next election cycle, they’ll tell us it’s something else, stupid. How about this? Let’s first invest in getting to know people’s economic lives, then create the content that evidences their pains and struggles, and finally—with policy depth—connect those struggles to tangible solutions. The voters aren’t stupid, and they never have been. So let’s stop treating them that way. Faiz Shakir is the founder of the advocacy journalism organization More Perfect Union.

Title: Trump relishes uttering the outlandish. Here's where some of his most showstopping comments stand

It may start as a casual aside, a wee-hours social media post or a much hyped announcement WASHINGTON -- It may start as a casual aside, a wee-hours social post or a much-hyped announcement. Whatever the delivery mechanism, President Donald Trump loves to toss out startling ideas aimed at dropping jaws, commandeering headlines and bolstering his political brand. Never in modern times has a president offered so many off-the-cuff statements with such a potential for wide, even global, impact. His sometimes implausible notions may become reality, or — through repetition — no longer sound so outlandish. At other times, Trump just moves on, either by fashioning a rhetorical off-ramp or finding a way to declare victory. Some ideas, though, just seem to fade away. Here's a look at some of Trump's showstopping utterances this term and where they stand. WHERE IT STANDS: Moving ahead. BACKSTORY: Trump has embraced the idea of getting a $400 million luxury plane as a gift from oil-rich Qatar for the U.S. to use as Air Force One until Boeing delivers long-delayed new planes to the government. The Pentagon said Wednesday it has accepted the jet for use as Air Force One, but retrofitting the plane to meet security requirements will be costly and take time. And ethics experts, Democrats, and even some conservatives have warned that accepting such a luxurious gift from a foreign government is unseemly and could violate constitutional provisions meant to avoid bribery. WHERE IT STANDS: In limbo. BACKSTORY: Trump posted on his social media site in early May that he wanted to reopen an “expanded and rebuilt” Alcatraz, the notorious former prison that has been closed for more than six decades — and he subsequently talked about it at the White House. The president hasn't said much on the subject since, nor addressed how lengthy, difficult and costly such a reclamation project would be. William K. Marshall III, the director of the Bureau of Prisons, said he's ordered an “assessment to determine our needs and the next steps,” even as California's Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, dismissed the idea as a “distraction.” Some administration officials have endorsed bringing back the lockup known as “The Rock,” which operated from 1934 to 1963. Border czar Tom Homan suggested it could be used to house migrants awaiting deportation. WHERE IT STANDS: Still talking. BACKSTORY: Trump first floated this idea of the “Great State of Canada” with a December post just after midnight. When new Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney recently visited Trump at the White House, he made a point of saying that Canada “won’t be for sale, ever.” Trump responded, “never say never.” Carney said later that he told the president privately to quit talking about making Canada a state. He didn't divulge Trump's reaction, though, noting only that it was necessary to distinguish between “a wish and a reality.” Trump nonetheless insisted during the meeting that Canada joining the United States would be a “wonderful marriage.” WHERE IT STANDS: Still talking. BACKSTORY: Trump continues to insist that the U.S. could “get” Greenland, which is part of the kingdom of Denmark, despite Copenhagen saying that's impossible. Vice President JD Vance visited Greenland in March for a quick stop at the U.S. military base there after island residents rejected a broader visit. During that trip, Vance scolded Denmark but acknowledged that Greenland would control its own sovereignty — while still suggesting that it may want to make a deal with the United States. WHERE IT STANDS: Political off-ramp found. BACKSTORY: Trump for months decried growing Chinese influence over the Panama Canal and even refused to rule out a U.S. invasion to retake control of the waterway. The situation appeared to simmer down when the White House hailed a nearly $23 billion deal announced in March that would sell two canal ports run by a company based in the Chinese territory of Hong Kong to investors led by the U.S. firm BlackRock. The deal has since hit regulatory snags, and has yet to be finalized. In the meantime, the U.S. signed an agreement giving its troops access to Panamanian facilities. WHERE IT STANDS: Faded away. BACKSTORY: Trump suggested in February that billionaire Elon Musk would be checking out Fort Knox in Kentucky to ensure that U.S. gold reserves were still there. Days later, the president said at a conservative conference outside Washington, “I'm going to go with Elon.” He then drew sustained applause by asking, “Would anybody like to join us?” Nothing has come of it since. WHERE IT STANDS: Losing steam. BACKSTORY: Trump has repeatedly floated the idea that the U.S. would “take over” war-torn Gaza and move out the Palestinians who live there. He even suggested that U.S. developers could turn the area into a “Riviera of the Middle East,” once the war between Israel and Hamas has concluded. The president at one point posted a fake video of himself and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sunbathing in Gaza and featuring a glitzy resort dubbed “TRUMP GAZA.” During his trip to the Mideast last week, Trump offered a different iteration of the idea, saying the U.S. could “get involved” in Gaza “and make it just a freedom zone.” The issue remains a nonstarter with Arab nations. WHERE IT STANDS: Still talking. BACKSTORY: Trump continues to suggest that an autopen was used to sign presidential pardons, legislation and other key documents during the tenure of former President Joe Biden. It's an accusation designed to question his Democratic predecessor's mental capacity and presidential authority. Trump's repeated complaints about Biden's autopen continue to get attention among some far-right media outlets and have prompted a Republican proposal in Congress to ban using autopens on presidential pardons. Trump has even suggested an investigation could be coming related to Biden signing immigration actions via autopen. “We’re going to start looking into this whole thing with who signed this legislation,” he said this week. WHERE IT STANDS: Faded away. BACKSTORY: Trump used his social media site in March to share a British media outlet's suggestion that Britain's King Charles III was making a “secret offer” to allow the United States to become an associate member of the British Commonwealth. “I love King Charles,” Trump wrote. “Sounds good to me!” Trump might have been joking, but his post sparked pushback online from supporters who roundly rejected the idea. He has not gone back to it. WHERE IT STANDS: Faded away. BACKSTORY: In February, Trump labeled Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy a “dictator without elections” in the midst of Russia's ongoing invasion of that country. Before Zelenskyy subsequently visited the White House, Trump backed off, saying, “Did I say that?” Trump still finds plenty to complain about with the Ukrainian leader, though, saying last week that U.S. aid to the country has been “pissed away.” WHERE IT STANDS: Still talking. BACKSTORY: In February, Trump said his administration would begin offering $5 million “ gold cards ” that give “very high-level people” a “route to citizenship.” The cards would grant foreigners visas to live and work in the United States. In early April, he held up a gold card featuring his name and picture and said they would be available in “less than two weeks, probably.” The card still hasn't gone on sale, but Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick recently told the All-In podcast that he'd already personally sold 1,000 of them. WHERE IT STANDS: Still talking — off and on. BACKSTORY: The Constitution's 22nd Amendment states no one can be elected president “more than twice.” That hasn't stopped Trump from talking about it — or the Trump Organization from selling “Trump 2028” gear, despite the president himself offering mixed signals. Asked about running for a third term during a recent NBC News interview, Trump replied, “I’m not looking at that.” But he added: “So many people want me to do it. I have never had requests so strong as that. But it’s something that, to the best of my knowledge, you’re not allowed to do. I don’t know if that’s constitutional.” That followed his saying in an interview with NBC News in March: “I’m not joking. There are methods which you could do it.” And he suggested to Time Magazine, “There are some loopholes.” ___ Will Weissert covers the White House for The Associated Press. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

It may start as a casual aside, a wee-hours social media post or a much hyped announcement WASHINGTON -- It may start as a casual aside, a wee-hours social post or a much-hyped announcement. Whatever the delivery mechanism, President Donald Trump loves to toss out startling ideas aimed at dropping jaws, commandeering headlines and bolstering his political brand. Never in modern times has a president offered so many off-the-cuff statements with such a potential for wide, even global, impact. His sometimes implausible notions may become reality, or — through repetition — no longer sound so outlandish. At other times, Trump just moves on, either by fashioning a rhetorical off-ramp or finding a way to declare victory. Some ideas, though, just seem to fade away. Here's a look at some of Trump's showstopping utterances this term and where they stand. WHERE IT STANDS: Moving ahead. BACKSTORY: Trump has embraced the idea of getting a $400 million luxury plane as a gift from oil-rich Qatar for the U.S. to use as Air Force One until Boeing delivers long-delayed new planes to the government. The Pentagon said Wednesday it has accepted the jet for use as Air Force One, but retrofitting the plane to meet security requirements will be costly and take time. And ethics experts, Democrats, and even some conservatives have warned that accepting such a luxurious gift from a foreign government is unseemly and could violate constitutional provisions meant to avoid bribery. WHERE IT STANDS: In limbo. BACKSTORY: Trump posted on his social media site in early May that he wanted to reopen an “expanded and rebuilt” Alcatraz, the notorious former prison that has been closed for more than six decades — and he subsequently talked about it at the White House. The president hasn't said much on the subject since, nor addressed how lengthy, difficult and costly such a reclamation project would be. William K. Marshall III, the director of the Bureau of Prisons, said he's ordered an “assessment to determine our needs and the next steps,” even as California's Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, dismissed the idea as a “distraction.” Some administration officials have endorsed bringing back the lockup known as “The Rock,” which operated from 1934 to 1963. Border czar Tom Homan suggested it could be used to house migrants awaiting deportation. WHERE IT STANDS: Still talking. BACKSTORY: Trump first floated this idea of the “Great State of Canada” with a December post just after midnight. When new Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney recently visited Trump at the White House, he made a point of saying that Canada “won’t be for sale, ever.” Trump responded, “never say never.” Carney said later that he told the president privately to quit talking about making Canada a state. He didn't divulge Trump's reaction, though, noting only that it was necessary to distinguish between “a wish and a reality.” Trump nonetheless insisted during the meeting that Canada joining the United States would be a “wonderful marriage.” WHERE IT STANDS: Still talking. BACKSTORY: Trump continues to insist that the U.S. could “get” Greenland, which is part of the kingdom of Denmark, despite Copenhagen saying that's impossible. Vice President JD Vance visited Greenland in March for a quick stop at the U.S. military base there after island residents rejected a broader visit. During that trip, Vance scolded Denmark but acknowledged that Greenland would control its own sovereignty — while still suggesting that it may want to make a deal with the United States. WHERE IT STANDS: Political off-ramp found. BACKSTORY: Trump for months decried growing Chinese influence over the Panama Canal and even refused to rule out a U.S. invasion to retake control of the waterway. The situation appeared to simmer down when the White House hailed a nearly $23 billion deal announced in March that would sell two canal ports run by a company based in the Chinese territory of Hong Kong to investors led by the U.S. firm BlackRock. The deal has since hit regulatory snags, and has yet to be finalized. In the meantime, the U.S. signed an agreement giving its troops access to Panamanian facilities. WHERE IT STANDS: Faded away. BACKSTORY: Trump suggested in February that billionaire Elon Musk would be checking out Fort Knox in Kentucky to ensure that U.S. gold reserves were still there. Days later, the president said at a conservative conference outside Washington, “I'm going to go with Elon.” He then drew sustained applause by asking, “Would anybody like to join us?” Nothing has come of it since. WHERE IT STANDS: Losing steam. BACKSTORY: Trump has repeatedly floated the idea that the U.S. would “take over” war-torn Gaza and move out the Palestinians who live there. He even suggested that U.S. developers could turn the area into a “Riviera of the Middle East,” once the war between Israel and Hamas has concluded. The president at one point posted a fake video of himself and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sunbathing in Gaza and featuring a glitzy resort dubbed “TRUMP GAZA.” During his trip to the Mideast last week, Trump offered a different iteration of the idea, saying the U.S. could “get involved” in Gaza “and make it just a freedom zone.” The issue remains a nonstarter with Arab nations. WHERE IT STANDS: Still talking. BACKSTORY: Trump continues to suggest that an autopen was used to sign presidential pardons, legislation and other key documents during the tenure of former President Joe Biden. It's an accusation designed to question his Democratic predecessor's mental capacity and presidential authority. Trump's repeated complaints about Biden's autopen continue to get attention among some far-right media outlets and have prompted a Republican proposal in Congress to ban using autopens on presidential pardons. Trump has even suggested an investigation could be coming related to Biden signing immigration actions via autopen. “We’re going to start looking into this whole thing with who signed this legislation,” he said this week. WHERE IT STANDS: Faded away. BACKSTORY: Trump used his social media site in March to share a British media outlet's suggestion that Britain's King Charles III was making a “secret offer” to allow the United States to become an associate member of the British Commonwealth. “I love King Charles,” Trump wrote. “Sounds good to me!” Trump might have been joking, but his post sparked pushback online from supporters who roundly rejected the idea. He has not gone back to it. WHERE IT STANDS: Faded away. BACKSTORY: In February, Trump labeled Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy a “dictator without elections” in the midst of Russia's ongoing invasion of that country. Before Zelenskyy subsequently visited the White House, Trump backed off, saying, “Did I say that?” Trump still finds plenty to complain about with the Ukrainian leader, though, saying last week that U.S. aid to the country has been “pissed away.” WHERE IT STANDS: Still talking. BACKSTORY: In February, Trump said his administration would begin offering $5 million “ gold cards ” that give “very high-level people” a “route to citizenship.” The cards would grant foreigners visas to live and work in the United States. In early April, he held up a gold card featuring his name and picture and said they would be available in “less than two weeks, probably.” The card still hasn't gone on sale, but Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick recently told the All-In podcast that he'd already personally sold 1,000 of them. WHERE IT STANDS: Still talking — off and on. BACKSTORY: The Constitution's 22nd Amendment states no one can be elected president “more than twice.” That hasn't stopped Trump from talking about it — or the Trump Organization from selling “Trump 2028” gear, despite the president himself offering mixed signals. Asked about running for a third term during a recent NBC News interview, Trump replied, “I’m not looking at that.” But he added: “So many people want me to do it. I have never had requests so strong as that. But it’s something that, to the best of my knowledge, you’re not allowed to do. I don’t know if that’s constitutional.” That followed his saying in an interview with NBC News in March: “I’m not joking. There are methods which you could do it.” And he suggested to Time Magazine, “There are some loopholes.” ___ Will Weissert covers the White House for The Associated Press. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

Title: ‘I burst out crying on referendum results day. I realised how exhausted and scared I had been’

Ten years ago this week, Ireland became the first country in the world to legalise same-sex marriage through a popular vote. More than 6,000 same-sex couples have been married in the decade since. Here, 10 of them share their wedding stories, reflecting on how the referendum changed their lives, and Ireland, and their concerns over a regression in attitudes towards LGBTQ+ rights. Independent politician and former government minister Katherine Zappone and Ann Louise Gilligan first met in 1981 in Boston College in Massachusetts, where they were both theology doctoral students. “The programme only took two people that year,” says Katherine, recalling the fated first encounter with her late wife. “We were a little nervous that it was just ourselves initially, but that dissipated pretty quickly.” The pair instantly hit it off and became a couple, and in October 1982 they held an intimate life-partnership ceremony to celebrate their love and commitment to each other. Katherine “never ever anticipated living or working or being in a partnership with anybody other than an American in America”, but she gladly followed Ann Louise back to Ireland, where they built a life together – Ann Louise as a theologian and Katherine as a lecturer, chief executive of the National Women’s Council, and later an independent politician. [ From the archive: Ireland becomes first country to approve same-sex marriage by popular voteOpens in new window ] Speaking of the anxiety they experienced living and working in Ireland during the 1980s and 1990s – homosexuality was only decriminalised in 1993 – Katherine says: “There was always that fear that if we became public Ann Louise would lose her job.” Ann Louise taught at St Patrick’s College in Drumcondra, “a college managed by the Archbishop of Dublin, and she did suffer at different times because of that”. In 2003, Katherine and Ann Louise’s relationship was legally recognised when they married at “a beautiful small gathering” in Vancouver in Canada. The couple then “prepared to take on the State, the Irish government”, so their Canadian marriage could be recognised here as well. Their legal battle was a significant catalyst for the Irish campaign for marriage equality. “When we got the judgment in 2006 that we couldn’t get our Canadian marriage recognised because it was against the Constitution, it sparked an even greater momentum,” Katherine says. “This was holy Ireland. During this period too, some of the authority of the church was being challenged because of all the forms of institutional abuse, especially against children. So people were starting to step back and think, ‘we need to be critical Catholics and make some decisions on our own’.” Katherine believes the Yes campaign’s success was thanks to the “radical spirit” of the Irish people. “I don’t want to romanticise this, but I think there’s something extraordinary about the culture of the people here. Because of that lengthy oppression and willingness to say no and resist and find creativity and be kind, in spite of it all, and to be radical. I just think this tapped into all that. “It reinvigorated our democracy in a way we had never seen before,” she adds, remembering the striking displays of “solidarity across differences, across political parties, across generations” and “also that image of citizens that know that they have the power” as the Yes result was announced at Dublin Castle on Saturday May 23rd, 2015. Katherine and Ann Louise’s Irish wedding took place in Dublin in January 2016. “She looked remarkably beautiful and was so strong,” says Katherine of Ann Louise, who was recovering from a brain haemorrhage at the time. Ann Louise died in June 2017, following a short illness. The striking red and black dresses they married in were subsequently donated by Katherine to the National Museum of Ireland, and have been displayed at Collins Barracks as symbols of the historic referendum. There are “several outstanding issues that make it difficult to be fully free or equal in Ireland,” says Katherine now, reflecting on progress on LGBTQ+ rights 10 years on from the referendum. “The marriage equality win went a long way to normalise the identities of lesbian and gay people. Obviously we have another journey in relation to trans and non-binary [people] which should flow from the former, but doesn’t necessarily. There are challenges in terms of mental health and wellbeing. The terrible, non-existing state of trans healthcare, especially for young people. The fact that not all ‘rainbow families’ are able to get both parents recognised in law.” Buzz O’Neill met Peter Maxwell online 18 years ago. Buzz recalls his first date with Peter – “a pint in The Norseman, and then dinner across in Pintxo’s across the way in Crown Alley” – in Dublin’s Temple Bar. The couple moved in together four months later and now live with their German shepherd Eric in Amsterdam, where Peter works for Heineken. Buzz is a club promoter, and has been involved with campaigning for LGBTQ+ rights in Ireland from “day one”. “When you say you’re from Ireland and you’re in a gay bar, anywhere in the world, the first thing people say is, ‘That was the first place to vote same-sex marriage in,’” says Buzz, referencing a recent encounter with someone he met while visiting Cape Town in South Africa. “It wasn’t just the stroke of a pen by a progressive government, it was the actual people of Ireland. We had to go out there for months and months and months to get it across the line.” PantiBar on Capel Street was a hub of joy on that May weekend in 2015, and a place Buzz “just didn’t want to leave”. “I wanted to be there, more than Dublin Castle with all the celebs. A load of my friends came in, gay and straight, and I just broke down,” he recalls, welling up at the memory. On a family holiday celebrating his parents’ 50th wedding anniversary that year, Buzz proposed to Peter during a day trip to Florence. I guess we were activists in the soft sense of the word during the marriage equality campaign. We were part of all the networks that popped up. We went around the country knocking on doors A few months later, on December 28th, 2015, they married in the Dublin Unitarian Church. The reception took place in The Grand Hotel in Malahide, where Buzz’s parents had celebrated their own wedding 50 years previously. “Because we were the first same-sex couple to get married in the Unitarian Church, our solemniser was emotional, to say the least,” laughs Buzz. “So emotional, that she forgot half of the actual written service. “You can go in there now and view that registry, which me and Peter have done a few times, and it’s hundreds and hundreds of marriages going back hundreds of years and then you just see two boys’ names.” He is concerned at the “backwards” shift in attitudes towards LGBTQ+ rights in recent years. “If the campaign was run today, I don’t think we’d win.” Etain Kidney and Michelle Walls met at The George in Dublin 20 years ago. “We famously have been married three times, and every one was as good as the last,” says Etain. “In 2012, Michelle asked me to marry her, and I have such a God complex that I then asked her back.” The couple were joined by close family and friends in the small registry office on Grand Canal Street in Dublin and became civil partners in April 2014. “Then we went to Spain and had a big wedding over there,” Etain says. Around 150 guests were present at their “official wedding day” in the sunny hills of the Costa del Sol. Almost a year after the marriage equality referendum, Etain and Michelle’s story came full circle and they tied the knot once more on home turf, in the same registry office where they had their first ceremony. Etain works in education and Michelle in car rental, and they live together in Dublin city centre with their sons Tadhg (8) and Bobby (5). Remembering the mix of emotions on results day, Etain describes how she “just burst out crying” at the count centre “and then realised how exhausted and scared I had been”. “I guess we were activists in the soft sense of the word during the marriage equality campaign,” she says. “We were part of all the networks that popped up. We went around the country knocking on doors.” Ten years on, the euphoria of the campaign’s success is “a real juxtaposition” with reality. “It’s quite poignant now to reflect on marriage equality 10 years later, when we got such resounding support from the country, to be a little bit scared to walk down the street again,” says Etain. “In the same way we were brave and bold back then, we need to all be brave and bold again. We need to use this anniversary of marriage equality to remind people that it’s a fight, that we still need to protest, and that freedom doesn’t happen by accident.” Linda Cullen and Feargha Ní Bhroin live in Blackrock in Dublin with their 15-year-old twin daughters Tess and Rosa Cullen-Byrne. The couple have been together for 20 years. “We discussed having kids very early on,” says Linda, a TV producer and chief executive of production company Coco Content. She directed The 34th, a documentary telling the story of marriage equality in Ireland. Feargha is a social justice researcher. The couple became civil partners in 2012, and joined the board of Marriage Equality years in advance of the referendum campaign. I have always loved Ireland. And yet, I did wonder, gosh if it’s a no, can we actually stay? “One of the main drivers was to seek protections for our children. And we knew marriage would have to come first. It shouldn’t have to, but we knew it would, and it did,” reflects Feargha, highlighting that “there are families without those protections still”. Linda recalls a poster from the No campaign erected outside their daughters’ bedroom “saying every child deserves a mother and a father” in the months leading up to the referendum. “They were at that age where they could absorb stuff very easily … When you opened the curtains every morning, that was facing them.” The campaign was “hugely emotional”, Linda recalls. “I have always loved Ireland. I’m a real nester. I’m in the house I was born in, I’m a complete home bird. And yet, I did wonder, gosh if it’s a no, can we actually stay?” For Feargha, the conversations that happened between friends in the days and weeks following the result were particularly meaningful. “We were all talking about our stories of coming out and issues we‘d had at work – friends who’d lost their jobs because they were lesbian – and we were talking in a way that we hadn’t before about the things that had happened to us or we‘d encountered. You couldn’t look at them before because you just had to keep going.” After a busy night celebrating the Yes result in May 2015, Linda was talked into proposing to Feargha on BBC’s 5 Live Breakfast Radio show. The couple married at a small wedding ceremony on August 20th, 2019. “On a personal level, I’m finally beginning to get comfortable with referring to Linda publicly as my wife. I found it so hard saying that for the longest time,” Feargha says. “So many times, when our names were put together, they assumed Feargha was a typo and would put ‘l’ at the end. So it would be Fergal and Linda. It is funny how people do all sorts of mental gymnastics to be able to accommodate the idea of two women with children being married.” Pointing to rollbacks in LGBTQ+ rights in Italy, Hungary and the US, they share concerns for the legal and personal safety of queer couples around the world. Ireland’s vote for marriage equality has been “life changing” for them, Linda says. “Before we met, we didn’t know we could have a life like this.” Joey Kavanagh moved from Co Meath to London the year before the referendum, from where he led the emigrant voting campaign Get the Boat 2 Vote – “a spur-of-the-moment thing that then became a very big part of my life” – which saw tens of thousands of young Irish citizens travelling home from abroad to vote for marriage equality. “It was only in the 48 hours coming up to the referendum that it really became clear that it was a big deal. There were people coming from Australia and Canada and all parts of the world to cast their vote. It was a really cool thing to be part of.” He remembers “feeling ecstatic” celebrating the result at Dublin Castle. “It felt like a watershed moment, a breakthrough after decades of hard-won fights by people who had been campaigning for this and turning out for protests and rallies and marches … It forced a lot of really difficult but useful conversations, and from that emotion and sharing of stories came some catharsis.” [ Marriage equality a decade on: ‘Things have gone backwards’Opens in new window ] Just a few weeks later, he was in the queue for a nightclub in Soho when he met Australian Liam Karma, who was coming to the end of a two-year visa and getting ready to return home to Melbourne. After a few months together, the relationship became a long distance one until shortly before their Irish wedding day three years later. On June 29th, 2018 – “the hottest day of the year” – they tied the knot and held a prom-themed wedding party at the Commercial Rowing Club in Islandbridge in Dublin 8. “It wasn’t a traditional wedding,” says Liam, whose mother joined them from Australia for the celebrations. “Dublin Pride was on the 30th so that was essentially day two of our wedding,” adds Joey. “A friend was working on PR for Dublin Bus and she got me and Liam and 15 of our friends on one of the buses. So we got to be in the Pride parade.” While “it does feel like queerness has been normalised in Ireland and it feels different to when I was growing up”, Joey says, “we‘re not in as hopeful a place at the moment, like the pendulum has swung and we‘re seeing very regressive moves, particularly around trans rights.” The couple now live with their two cats, Mog and Dagen, in Dublin 7. “We have no plans to adopt human children but these are our babies.” Joey works for the Arts Council and Liam is a store manager; he was granted Irish citizenship in December. On their first date in 2016, after hitting it off during a night out in Belfast’s Union Street Bar, James McConville told Paul Corcoran “that we were going to get married”. Three years later they celebrated their wedding at Ballyvolane House in Fermoy, Co Cork, not far from where they now live. On August 17th, 2019, James, an entrepreneur from Belfast, and Paul, a Cork native who works in tech support, held their marriage ceremony in a barn. Paul is a solemniser with Pagan Federation Ireland. “For me, the word pagan is equivalent to being spiritually queer. It is having a sense of your own agency and autonomy, still working within a community, but you kind of get to make the rules up as you go along,” he says. When it was his turn to be on the other side of the altar, he wanted to incorporate some pagan traditions. “We had all the chairs arranged in two concentric circles, with a central altar. A circle was cast around the space and we consecrated the circle with water and fire. We both come from Catholic families so that sort of ceremony with smells and bells is something they’re all very comfortable with.” The couple want to start a family, but “it’s not as easy for us, as gay men,” says James. “We looked at the adoption route and we were told by someone in Tusla that it was near impossible, because of the legislation in place at the minute. To be told that because of who we are we wouldn’t be able to adopt, it did feel like we were second-class citizens.” Paul recounts the intensity of the period leading up to the referendum in 2015. “I remember the last two weeks, I was working in a cafe in Galway and we were surrounded by the No campaign posters. I walked to work with my head down.” Afterwards, he describes feeling huge relief; “There was a huge shift in my head because everyone that I looked at, I thought, you probably voted Yes.” Ten years later, emotions are still high. “I was in a shop the other day and that Snow Patrol song Just Say Yes came on, and I started crying.” Val Tataru and Max Plamadeala met at their local nightclub in Moldova 16 years ago and their relationship quickly blossomed. The couple moved to Dublin together six years ago. Having grown up in Moldova and worked for some time in Russia, both countries where same-sex marriage is illegal, Ireland’s new law was the deciding factor in their move. “What attracted us here was the referendum, to be honest … we were in need of that security,” says Val, who was encouraged by the 62 per cent Yes vote. “This says something about the country and the friendliness of the people here.” I was somehow shocked how normal it felt to be able to go to the registry office and do it officially When Val and Max moved to Ireland, they house-shared with another gay couple who encouraged them to attend Dublin Pride. Although apprehensive, they agreed to go to the parade. It was “a completely different experience” for Val, who was more accustomed to “something like a very small manifestation in a nightclub, which was not advertised” in Moldova. “I saw another side to the world where you don’t have to hide ... That was probably the moment when I felt liberated from my fears. And from then on, we were never afraid to hold hands in public.” On May 24th, 2019, the couple were married in front of friends and family in Dublin. “It was a nice ceremony, full of tears ... I was somehow shocked how normal it felt to be able to go to the registry office and do it officially.” For Val, marriage means safety and peace of mind. “You feel like you are protected. I know my husband will be able to visit me in hospital and have the possibility to make decisions for me, should I be unable to.” It also opens the door for other “steps that you usually take in your life, such as buying a house”, because they can do so as a couple here. “It empowered us to feel included in society. We have the same rights as everyone else.” Actors Shane O’Reilly and Paul Curley met while acting in a show together with Kilkenny Barnstorm Theatre Company in 2009. Shane is also a playwright and Paul is a children’s theatre maker. “I was playing a giant and Paul was playing Jack in a version of Jack and the Beanstalk, so Jack and the giant got together in this story,” says Shane. “Under the stars beside this astonishing lake, he asked me to marry him,” he adds, recalling Paul’s romantic proposal in New Zealand 16 years later. The pair opted to get married in City Hall, Dublin, on January 29th this year. As well as its association with the referendum celebrations, the location was meaningful for Shane’s father “who worked for Dublin City Council his whole life as a carpenter”. “He did his initial exams and his introduction to Dublin through that room in City Hall.” Shane’s parents are both deaf so there were a lot of sign language and visual elements integrated into the day. “Then we headed over to Fallon and Byrne and ate and drank and danced the night away.” [ ‘It’s better than a dig in the face’: LGBT employees on how the workplace became more accepting ] The day the Yes result was announced is one that remains “seared into your consciousness”, says Shane, who vividly remembers “driving out of the city with this enormous sense of celebration behind us as we headed towards Galway,” where they were going to see a friend’s show. At Paul’s family home in east Galway, there is a series of wedding photographs tracing lineage from his great grandparents to his parents. “It’s always been something I’ve looked at when having dinner there and thought, God, what a beautiful legacy of people who have gotten married. They are like totems of this family,” says Shane, who feels secure in the fact that he and Paul now share the same status. For Paul, his wedding ring is “more than a symbol, it’s a real recognition of our commitment and life together”, which he is reminded of every time he puts the ring back on after performing on stage. Ireland AM presenter Alan Hughes and theatre producer Karl Broderick met on the street in Dublin on September 20th, 1993. “We got on the same bus,” Karl remembers. “The number 28. Alan asked for my number and got off in Fairview, and I got off in Artane, and the next day he phoned and we met that night.” Their first date was in The Yacht in Clontarf, a few weeks after legislation was passed decriminalising homosexuality in Ireland. Karl recalls the discomfort they felt on the date, thinking they could bump into people they knew. “But there was a thriving gay scene in Dublin, even at that stage. There were bars like the South William and the Viking and the George,” Alan recalls. “People were protective and looked out for each other.” Twenty-three years later, Alan and Karl celebrated their civil partnership at the Unitarian Church on St Stephen’s Green in 2011. They threw a “lavish” wedding party in the Mansion House which attracted a lot of media coverage, including a cover story for VIP Magazine. “We felt a huge responsibility to every gay person out there,” Karl says. As a presenter on Irish breakfast TV, Alan has always been open about his sexuality. “From day one I always talked about Karl. I was on breakfast TV 25 years ago in Ireland as an openly gay man.” Following an on-screen proposal after the referendum, the couple were married on September 30th, 2016 at a “low-key” ceremony. Just Alan’s brother Kevin and Karl’s sister Ann – who also took the photographs - were present as witnesses. “The four of us went to the registry office in Bray, got lunch in Powerscourt Hotel and were in the spa by 4pm.” Reflecting on the decade anniversary of the referendum, Karl says “younger people need to know where we come from and never forget that we stand on the shoulders of giants. We’re lucky with the time we’re in. If we think of history as one line made up of pencil dots, we’re in that pencil dot where it became okay. That’s huge. People who went before us couldn’t live the life they were meant to live.” Alan believes there has been a marked shift towards acceptance overall, highlighting interactions with fans of the couple’s annual pantomime. “Thousands of people come to see our panto every year and they know me and they know I’m gay, they know Karl is my husband. That’s a lovely reflection on society, and acceptance.” But more needs to be done, he says: “Ten years on, we need to reset the focus. Things are getting bad again and we need to start spreading the word that love is love.” Sarah McDevitt was 32 when she came out in September 2013. The following St Patrick’s Day, she met Geraldine Stone, and exactly a year later the couple got engaged on Streedagh Beach in Co Sligo, near where Sarah grew up, the day after her mother‘s 60th birthday celebrations. It was March 2015, two months before the referendum. “At that point we were planning to get civil partnered; we weren’t getting married. That wasn’t even a possibility,” Sarah says. When they booked Kilronan Castle in Co Roscommon for their wedding reception that December, the couple “didn’t know Roscommon was going to vote No and that we‘d end up being the first people to get married there after marriage equality”, says Sarah. “The morning of the results, I went wedding dress shopping because I thought that was the best way to deal with the nerves.” Sarah and Geraldine and their four children – Lochlan, Grayson, Willow and Cooper – now live in Killester in north Dublin. Sarah works in advertising and Geraldine in telecommunications. They took it in turns carrying and giving birth to each child. Sharing this experience, Sarah says, has made them “stronger as a couple”. “You can be a lot more empathetic to your partner.” A prominent campaigner for LGBTQ+ parental rights, Sarah says the fight for equality is not over, as the Children and Family Relationships Act, passed in April 2015 to expand parental rights and responsibilities to non-traditional families, still excludes gay men with children. “When we had Lochlan, it wasn’t enacted,” she says, referring to the Children and Family Relationships Bill. “Before we even started IVF, we were writing to Simon Harris [asking] ‘When is it going to happen?’ [ LGBT families in Ireland still caught in legal loopholeOpens in new window ] “When he [Lochlan] was born, I was a single parent because there was no way that Ger could be on the birth certificate ... Ger couldn’t make any decisions for him. It was like she was a total stranger to him, even though she was raising him … that was really painful.” The scope of the legislation widened in May 2020 to include co-parenting legal recognition for certain same-sex female couples, says Sarah, though in her view it remains “very limited”. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: The Istanbul kabuki – decoded
URL: https://www.activistpost.com/the-istanbul-kabuki-decoded/
Time Published: 2025-05-23T02:36:00Z
Full Content:
Editor Empire Pepe Escobar, Strategic Culture Foundation The endgame is clear: the US losing the entire Eurasian land mass. Ukraine, under these immense geopolitical imperatives, is only a sovereign-deprived pawn in the (Great) Game. Did President Putin really change the game by proposing the resumption of negotiations on the proxy war in Ukraine in Istanbul – over three years after the first ones were scotched by NATO? It’s complicated. And depends on which “game” we’re talking about. What the Russian move instantly accomplished was to throw into total disarray the European warmongering Three Stooges (Starmer, BlackRock chancellor, Le Petit Roi) Cocaine Express. Irrelevant Europe was not even at the table in Istanbul – except via extensive previous briefing of the low-rent, shabby-dressed Ukrainian delegation. That was compounded by the noisy barking threat in the sidelines advocating “more sanctions” to “pressure Russia”. In March 2022 in Istanbul, Kiev could have stopped the war. Every one of us who were in Istanbul at the time could foresee that Kiev would eventually have to be forced to the table all over again. So in essence we are back to the same negotiation – with the same top Russian negotiator, competent historian Vladimir Medinsky, heading a delegation composed by pros, but with Ukraine now facing over a million dead; deprived of at least four regions – more on the way; what’s left of its mineral wealth de facto controlled by the US; and a horrendous black hole that passes for an “economy”. We are talking about country 404 territory. During the negotiations on Friday, Medinsky went straight to the point: “We don’t want war, but we are ready to fight for a year, two, three – as long as it takes. We fought with Sweden for 21 years [the Great Northern War, 1700-1721, as it is known in Russia]. How long are you ready to fight?” That’s the geopolitical/military state of things for Kiev and their “to the last Ukrainian” warmongering backers: either you capitulate, or we’re going to hurt you even more. What’s the point of these negotiations? Turkiye under uber-opportunist Sultan Erdogan in fact hosted a P.R. meeting between Moscow, Kiev and itself – with the Ukrainians unleashing a blitzkrieg of infantile tantrums only designed to influence global public opinion. In sharp contrast, the head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund, Kirill Dmitriev, did his best to put a positive spin on the proceedings. Istanbul 2.0, Dmitriev asserted, achieved a large exchange of prisoners (1,000 on each side); ceasefire options to be presented by both sides; and a continuation of dialogue. That’s not much. Well, at least they discussed in the same language: Russian. Nothing was lost in translation. A serious case can be made that to propose the resumption of these negotiations, under this format, was meaningless. There’s no evidence in the horizon both parties might touch the fundamental issue anytime soon: the whole geopolitical strategic equation in Eastern Europe, from the Barents Sea to the Black Sea and beyond – leading to an “indivisibility of security” new deal with global repercussions. That implies that whatever track these negotiations may follow further on down the road, they are an objective impossibility. Meanwhile, the proxy war in Ukraine – and the SMO – will go on. That would also suggest that the Moscow security establishment considers the neo-nazi instrumentalized goons in Kiev at best as a re-enactment of the 6th Army of Paulus, with which you negotiate the end of a battle, but not the end of the war. Even NATO semi-realists as retired Commodore Steven Jermy have been forced to admit that “Russia is in the driving seat” and clueless Europeans “appear to believe that the losers should dictate the terms of ceasefire or surrender.” All the barking by the – European – chihuahuas of war cannot disguise the fundamental geopolitical/military fact: a massive NATO humiliation. Trump’s humongous problem is that he has to manage it – and sell it to domestic public opinion and the global public opinion as some sort of “deal” he struck with Putin. It’s enlightening once again to go back to Grandmaster Lavrov, always the uber-realist, back in September 2024: “In April 2022, Russian and Ukrainian negotiators reached agreement in Istanbul. If that agreement had been observed, Ukraine would have preserved part of Donbass. But every time another agreement, always accepted by Russia, is broken, Ukraine shrinks in size.” The (Great) Game, revisited Now back to the (Great) Game. Kiev negotiators eventually admitting Ukrainian capitulation means a NATO capitulation and an Empire of Chaos capitulation. That’s the ultimate anathema for the US ruling classes. Even an ultra-negotiated, carefully managed Ukrainian surrender will be an impossible sell – not to mention Washington under Narcissus Drowned Trump acknowledging a strategic defeat. Because that will mean the Empire of Chaos losing Eurasia for good: the ultimate Mackinder/Brzezinski nightmare. Coupled with the consequential solidification of the multi-nodal, multipolar world. The Russia-China stategic partnership is very much aware of every nook and cranny in this larger-than-life process. Beyond the current Turkish kabuki, they clearly understand the Big Eurasia Equation. Beijing is fully aware NATO’s real goal was always to confront it via Russia. Ukraine was NATO’s pawn to take down Russia then get to China from the West. The goal of the US ruling elites as they configured their thalassocratic empire remains to blockade China from the West by land and sea, using Russia; then use Taiwan as a staging area to blockade China from the East by sea. No wonder control of Taiwan is a Chinese strategic imperative. Enter Mackinder panic – all over again: the China-Russia strategic partnership can beat NATO hands down – and Russia, by itself, is already doing it. Xi and Putin once again discussed the chessboard in detail, in person, prior to the Victory Day parade last week in Moscow. The endgame, once again, is clear: the US losing the entire Eurasian land mass. Ukraine, under these immense geopolitical imperatives, is only a sovereign-deprived pawn in the (Great) Game. As for the tantrum-addicted clown in Kiev, he is merely an actor with no authority whatsoever, negotiations included. He is completely dominated by Ukrainian neo-Nazis who will kill him if and when the war is over. He merely fronts for them and gets paid off. And that’s why – enthusiastically supported by inconsequential London, Paris and Berlin – he’s obsessed to continue a Forever War destroying the very nation he claims to represent.

Title: Trump Admin Backs Red States’ Antitrust Suit Against Financial Titans To ‘Protect Coal’
URL: https://dailycaller.com/2025/05/22/trump-admin-backs-antitrust-suit-esg-protect-coal/
Time Published: 2025-05-22T18:38:19Z

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Department of Justice (DOJ) threw their weight behind an antitrust lawsuit against major asset managers that alleges the firms colluded to tank coal production with their embrace of zero-emissions goals on Thursday morning. The lawsuit, led by Paxton and backed by ten other state attorneys general, alleges that BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street collusively used their market power to suppress coal production, thereby burdening consumers by causing the price of coal to skyrocket. The Trump FTC and the DOJ filed a statement of interest on Thursday supporting the attorneys general’s lawsuit, signaling the administration’s view that the firms’ so-called “environmental, social and corporate governance” (ESG) investing may fall afoul of antitrust law. “President Donald Trump understands the importance of coal for our energy security and has vowed to fight left-wing ideologues who seek to make us weaker and poorer under the guise of ESG,” said FTC Chairman Andrew Ferguson. “Today, the Federal Trade Commission carries out this administration’s mission to unleash American energy dominance, protect coal, and stop the left’s attempt to corrupt financial markets with political and social objectives.” (RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: Attorney General Ken Paxton Sends Warning To Companies Using ESG Practices) Larry Fink, Chairman and CEO of BlackRock visits “The Claman Countdown” at Fox Business Network Studios on April 11, 2025 in New York City. (Photo by Jamie McCarthy via Getty Images) “These companies allegedly blocked the production of American coal in the name of climate change scaremongering, all so they could take money out of the pockets of American consumers and put it in theirs,” Ferguson continued. The FTC and DOJ are taking action following Trump’s day-one energy emergency declaration and his April 8 executive order, which directed federal agencies to “encourage and support our Nation’s coal industry to increase our energy supply, lower electricity costs, stabilize our grid, create high-paying jobs, support burgeoning industries, and assist our allies.” “The President has declared a national energy emergency, and we need competition in coal production now more than ever to help fuel American energy dominance,” said Assistant Attorney General Abigail A. Slater of the DOJ’s Antitrust Division. “American consumers suffer when institutional asset managers use shareholdings in competing companies to orchestrate output reductions.” BlackRock, State Street and Vanguard are three of the world’s largest asset managers. All three were members of the Net Zero Asset Managers (NZAM) initiative until Vanguard dropped out in December 2022 and BlackRock exited the coalition in January. The DOJ and FTC’s “support for this baseless case undermines the Trump Administration’s goal of American energy independence,” a BlackRock spokesperson wrote to the Daily Caller News Foundation. “As we made clear in our earlier motion to dismiss, this case is trying to re-write antitrust law and is based on an absurd theory that coal companies conspired with their shareholders to reduce coal production. Forcing asset managers to divest from coal companies will harm their ability to access capital and invest in their businesses and employees, likely leading to higher energy prices.” “These asset managers, which have been acting as an ESG climate cartel have not only deceived investors but also harmed millions of American families by raising costs and contributing to record inflation,” executive director of Consumers’ Research Will Hild wrote to the DCNF. “Not only does the FTC and DOJ agree that the investments made were driven by a radical, political objective, but go directly against President Trump’s energy goals.” The White House, the FTC, Paxton’s office, Vanguard and State Street did not respond to the DCNF’s requests for comment.

Back then, the price of the leading cryptocurrency stood at next to nothing, with the asset trading from $0.001 to a high of $0.29 at the end of the year, and was only available on a handful of niche exchanges. Fast-forward 15 years, and BTC just hit a new high of $111,770 Thursday afternoon, according to CoinGecko. That record price means 10,000 BTC today is worth over $1.1 billion, or 2,726,000,000% more than the $41 paid for the two Papa John's pies on Bitcoin Pizza Day. Bitcoin Pizza Day celebrates the time that Hanyecz wrote on a Bitcoin forum asking if someone would send him food in exchange for 10,000 BTC. "I'll pay 10,000 Bitcoin for a couple of pizzas… like maybe 2 large ones so I have some left over for the next day," he posted on May 22, 2010. "If you're interested, please let me know and we can work out a deal," he added. A fellow Bitcoiner responded to Hanyecz, taking him up on the offer. It's worth noting that the Papa John's restaurant did not accept cryptocurrency, and someone bought the pizzas and sent them to Hanyecz's house using dollars in exchange for the 10,000 BTC. But the story is marked every year for one of the first known times Bitcoin was used to buy something—and a startling reminder of how much the price of BTC has surged over the last 15 years. Since then, the price of the digital coin has endured several booms and busts, and is no longer just a tool used by people to buy drugs on dark web marketplaces or reimburse strangers for long-distance pizza orders. Crypto exchanges are now available across the globe, and institutions have jumped in headfirst, with Bitcoin exchange-traded funds managed by the likes of Wall Street giants BlackRock and Fidelity allowing customers to get exposure to the cryptocurrency. The U.S. government even has a strategic Bitcoin reserve in the works, thanks to President Trump's recent executive order—with the idea to hold the cryptocurrency like it does with other assets, such as gold. Still, Bitcoin was created as an alternative to fiat currency and the traditional banking system, so one could send and receive money without going through a middleman. And despite the fast rise of the digital asset, it still isn't easy to spend Bitcoin on pizza or other real-world items. Things might be changing—albeit slowly—after American fast food chain Steak 'n Shake announced last week that customers could use the cryptocurrency to buy burgers. The move is unusual, though, and most restaurants still don't accept the big orange coin. While some businesses do accept BTC payments, many Bitcoiners are indeed reluctant to spend the money given its growing status as a store-of-value asset and its sizable long-term gains. Given how much the value of Hanyecz's BTC grew in the 15 years since he swapped 10K worth for a couple pizzas, it’s easy to see why Bitcoiners wouldn’t want to repeat his feat.

Title: Trump Admin Throws Weight Behind Lawsuit Alleging Wall Street Embraced ESG To Shut Down Coal

Skip to comments. Posted on 05/22/2025 9:30:27 AM PDT by george76 Brief represents the first time the Trump administration has weighed in on green investing issues.. The Federal Trade Commission is throwing its weight behind a high-profile federal lawsuit led by 12 Republican-led states accusing three of the world's largest asset managers—BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard—of artificially constricting the coal market in violation of U.S. antitrust laws, the Washington Free Beacon has learned. The filing in the case is a remarkable move that represents the first time the Trump administration has waded directly into an issue or case related to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) policies. Led by powerful asset managers and banks, the ESG movement broadly calls for investors to pull money away from traditional energy industries, like coal and oil, and divert it to green energy industries in the fight against global warming. "Competition in coal markets incentivizes companies to produce as much coal as the market demands," the FTC stated in its Thursday brief. "Allowing the marketplace to freely determine the intersection of supply and demand is thus critical to America’s energy security and economic dynamism." "This case is about alleged anticompetitive conduct that increased energy prices for ordinary American consumers and businesses," it continued. The case dates back to November when Texas attorney general Ken Paxton filed a complaint alongside 11 other states, accusing defendants of violating century-old antitrust laws by collectively acquiring substantial ownership stakes in every major coal company in the country before using their newfound influence to pressure the industry to adopt climate goals like cutting coal output in half by 2030. Paxton said those actions have contributed to rising electricity prices. Coal-fired power currently generates less than 15 percent of the nation's total electricity, down from the 33 percent it generated a decade ago, according to federal data. In that same time period, the average price of electricity has steadily increased. In its brief Thursday, filed in the District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, the FTC made clear its interest in protecting Americans from anticompetitive behavior that "reduces the production of domestic energy, raises energy prices for consumers and businesses, and undermines America’s energy dominance." The brief clarified that antitrust laws allow for passive fund investing and that the federal government does not intend to argue otherwise. The case, however, is about the coordinated use of the power to distort output and prices in energy markets, the commission wrote. Paxton's complaint alleged that BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard ultimately deceived thousands of investors "who elected to invest in non-ESG funds to maximize their profits" but whose money was used to pursue ESG strategies. "The President has declared a national energy emergency, and we need competition in coal production now more than ever to help fuel American energy dominance," Abigail Slater, the assistant attorney general for the Justice Department’s antitrust division, said in a statement. "American consumers suffer when institutional asset managers use shareholdings in competing companies to orchestrate output reductions." Texas's complaint accuses defendants of violating the Sherman Act and Clayton Act. Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, West Virginia, and Wyoming joined as plaintiffs. "This is great news for the case and for the country because it helps validate the arguments that Ken Paxton's office and the other states have been making," Will Hild, the executive director of watchdog group Consumers Research and a prominent critic of ESG policies, said in an interview. "What I really hope to see coming out of this is these companies acknowledging that they messed up and figuring out how they're going to make it right for American consumers in these states and then promising never to do it again," he continued. "But I think the pressure is really building in a monumental way." BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The court is expected to rule on the defendants' motion to dismiss in the coming weeks. A hearing on the motion is slated for early June. Critics of the ESG movement say it seeks to improperly boost politically favored green industries that aren't profitable at the expense of more profitable energy industries. In doing so, they argue, ESG policies harm American investors—asset managers that have a legally-mandated fiduciary duty to promote the wellbeing of clients whose money they manage. Citing those arguments, several GOP states like Texas and lawmakers have taken action to block ESG policies nationwide. "Woke corporations are collectively adopting and imposing progressive policy goals that American consumers do not want or do not need," Rep. Jim Jordan (R., Ohio), the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said in 2022 after he launched a sweeping antitrust investigation into Wall Street over ESG. ESG efforts proliferated on Wall Street in recent years, with major financial institutions, including the defendants in Texas's case, joining large net zero coalitions designed to marshal initiatives pushing public companies to reduce their carbon emissions. And the Biden administration itself introduced ESG-related policies at the Securities and Exchange Commission and Department of Labor. President Donald Trump's electoral victory, however, dealt a crippling blow to the ESG movement and, as a result, Wall Street largely backtracked from its previous efforts. For example, the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, a high-profile international coalition whose membership included some of the world's largest banks, suspended operations in January after BlackRock withdrew for unspecified legal reasons. Texas referenced the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative in its November lawsuit, alleging that it was used by defendants to push their ESG objectives.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson The Federal Trade Commission is throwing its weight behind a high-profile federal lawsuit led by 12 Republican-led states accusing three of the world's largest asset managers—BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard—of artificially constricting the coal market in violation of U.S. antitrust laws, the Washington Free Beacon has learned. The filing in the case is a remarkable move that represents the first time the Trump administration has waded directly into an issue or case related to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) policies. Led by powerful asset managers and banks, the ESG movement broadly calls for investors to pull money away from traditional energy industries, like coal and oil, and divert it to green energy industries in the fight against global warming. "Competition in coal markets incentivizes companies to produce as much coal as the market demands," the FTC stated in its Thursday brief. "Allowing the marketplace to freely determine the intersection of supply and demand is thus critical to America’s energy security and economic dynamism." "This case is about alleged anticompetitive conduct that increased energy prices for ordinary American consumers and businesses," it continued. The case dates back to November when Texas attorney general Ken Paxton filed a complaint alongside 11 other states, accusing defendants of violating century-old antitrust laws by collectively acquiring substantial ownership stakes in every major coal company in the country before using their newfound influence to pressure the industry to adopt climate goals like cutting coal output in half by 2030. Paxton said those actions have contributed to rising electricity prices. Coal-fired power currently generates less than 15 percent of the nation's total electricity, down from the 33 percent it generated a decade ago, according to federal data. In that same time period, the average price of electricity has steadily increased. In its brief Thursday, filed in the District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, the FTC made clear its interest in protecting Americans from anticompetitive behavior that "reduces the production of domestic energy, raises energy prices for consumers and businesses, and undermines America’s energy dominance." The brief clarified that antitrust laws allow for passive fund investing and that the federal government does not intend to argue otherwise. The case, however, is about the coordinated use of the power to distort output and prices in energy markets, the commission wrote.

The case, however, is about the coordinated use of the power to distort output and prices in energy markets, the commission wrote. Paxton's complaint alleged that BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard ultimately deceived thousands of investors "who elected to invest in non-ESG funds to maximize their profits" but whose money was used to pursue ESG strategies. "The President has declared a national energy emergency, and we need competition in coal production now more than ever to help fuel American energy dominance," Abigail Slater, the assistant attorney general for the Justice Department’s antitrust division, said in a statement. "American consumers suffer when institutional asset managers use shareholdings in competing companies to orchestrate output reductions." Texas's complaint accuses defendants of violating the Sherman Act and Clayton Act. Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, West Virginia, and Wyoming joined as plaintiffs. "This is great news for the case and for the country because it helps validate the arguments that Ken Paxton's office and the other states have been making," Will Hild, the executive director of watchdog group Consumers Research and a prominent critic of ESG policies, said in an interview. "What I really hope to see coming out of this is these companies acknowledging that they messed up and figuring out how they're going to make it right for American consumers in these states and then promising never to do it again," he continued. "But I think the pressure is really building in a monumental way." BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The court is expected to rule on the defendants' motion to dismiss in the coming weeks. A hearing on the motion is slated for early June. Critics of the ESG movement say it seeks to improperly boost politically favored green industries that aren't profitable at the expense of more profitable energy industries. In doing so, they argue, ESG policies harm American investors—asset managers that have a legally-mandated fiduciary duty to promote the wellbeing of clients whose money they manage. Citing those arguments, several GOP states like Texas and lawmakers have taken action to block ESG policies nationwide. "Woke corporations are collectively adopting and imposing progressive policy goals that American consumers do not want or do not need," Rep. Jim Jordan (R., Ohio), the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said in 2022 after he launched a sweeping antitrust investigation into Wall Street over ESG. ESG efforts proliferated on Wall Street in recent years, with major financial institutions, including the defendants in Texas's case, joining large net zero coalitions designed to marshal initiatives pushing public companies to reduce their carbon emissions. And the Biden administration itself introduced ESG-related policies at the Securities and Exchange Commission and Department of Labor. President Donald Trump's electoral victory, however, dealt a crippling blow to the ESG movement and, as a result, Wall Street largely backtracked from its previous efforts. For example, the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, a high-profile international coalition whose membership included some of the world's largest banks, suspended operations in January after BlackRock withdrew for unspecified legal reasons. Texas referenced the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative in its November lawsuit, alleging that it was used by defendants to push their ESG objectives.

Coal-fired power currently generates less than 15 percent of the nation's total electricity, down from the 33 percent it generated a decade ago, according to federal data.

"What I really hope to see coming out of this is these companies acknowledging that they messed up and figuring out how they're going to make it right for American consumers in these states and then promising never to do it again," he continued. "But I think the pressure is really building in a monumental way." BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The court is expected to rule on the defendants' motion to dismiss in the coming weeks. A hearing on the motion is slated for early June. Critics of the ESG movement say it seeks to improperly boost politically favored green industries that aren't profitable at the expense of more profitable energy industries. In doing so, they argue, ESG policies harm American investors—asset managers that have a legally-mandated fiduciary duty to promote the wellbeing of clients whose money they manage. Citing those arguments, several GOP states like Texas and lawmakers have taken action to block ESG policies nationwide. "Woke corporations are collectively adopting and imposing progressive policy goals that American consumers do not want or do not need," Rep. Jim Jordan (R., Ohio), the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said in 2022 after he launched a sweeping antitrust investigation into Wall Street over ESG. ESG efforts proliferated on Wall Street in recent years, with major financial institutions, including the defendants in Texas's case, joining large net zero coalitions designed to marshal initiatives pushing public companies to reduce their carbon emissions. And the Biden administration itself introduced ESG-related policies at the Securities and Exchange Commission and Department of Labor. President Donald Trump's electoral victory, however, dealt a crippling blow to the ESG movement and, as a result, Wall Street largely backtracked from its previous efforts. For example, the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, a high-profile international coalition whose membership included some of the world's largest banks, suspended operations in January after BlackRock withdrew for unspecified legal reasons. Texas referenced the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative in its November lawsuit, alleging that it was used by defendants to push their ESG objectives.
