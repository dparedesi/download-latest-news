President Trump takes questions from the press. In a surprising twist that has created controversy in the Bitcoin community, recent moves by President Trump’s newly launched World Liberty Financial have cast fresh light on the differences between Bitcoin and Ethereum. At the heart of the controversy is a transaction involving wrapped bitcoin and bitcoin, terms that are anything but synonymous. On Jan. 20, Donald Trump Jr. posted a series of strategic token purchases that commemorated the inauguration of his father as the 47th president of the United States. The purchases included: At first glance, this might appear to affirm bitcoin’s centrality in Trump’s digital currency realm. However, a closer look reveals that aside from TRX, all tokens are Ethereum-based assets. Wrapped Bitcoin, for example, is not stored on the bitcoin blockchain but instead exists as an ERC20 token on Ethereum. It is backed 1:1 by bitcoin through a complex minting process that involves trusted custodians and merchant intermediaries. The mechanism behind WBTC underscores its multifaceted utility. As outlined in its 2019 whitepaper, WBTC is a fundamentally different version of bitcoin, designed to leverage Ethereum’s expansive decentralized finance ecosystem. Users who acquire wrapped bitcoin gain exposure to bitcoin’s value while enjoying the benefits of Ethereum’s smart contract capabilities and turing complete functionality. These include lending, borrowing, and yield generation, to name a few. However the token’s holder does not own bitcoin in the elemental sense. Instead, they possess a derivative that exists only on another chain. This arrangement enhances token interoperability and serves as a clever, if controversial, marketing tool for political figures like Trump. With the formation of World Liberty Financial in August 2024, questions have surfaced regarding the actual amount of bitcoin holdings. The widespread publicity surrounding these transactions now casts doubt on previously held assumptions that the president and his advisors were staunch bitcoin advocates, revealing instead a tilt toward Ethereum’s ecosystem. The debate between bitcoin and its wrapped counterpart touches on deeper ideological and practical considerations for cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin, heralded by industry veterans such as Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, is praised for its scarcity, store-of-value properties, and robust security anchored by proof-of-work. Armstrong even noted bitcoin’s superiority over gold regarding divisibility and portability. In contrast, Ethereum’s proof-of-stake system, which converted from proof-of-work in September 2022, offers enhanced versatility for decentralized applications. Adding another layer of intrigue, the transaction post included TRX, the native token of Tron. Tron has faced intense scrutiny. Despite being part of a broader, well-integrated ecosystem, Tron has faced intense scrutiny. A report from TRM Labs highlighted that while Tron achieved a remarkable reduction in illicit activity in 2024, it still accounted for 58% of all illicit crypto volumes. This reality continues challenging the balance between innovation and regulatory compliance in digital finance. At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Bank of America CEO, Brian Moynihan, stated that President Trump’s support for digital currencies could transform the banking industry's stance on crypto. He stated, “If the rules come in and make it a real thing that you can actually do business with, you’ll find that the banking system will come in hard on the transactional side of it.” Earlier this week, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink emphasized bitcoin as a hedge against economic instability. “If you're frightened of the debasement of your currency…you can have an internationally-based instrument called bitcoin,” Fink asserts, recognizing its growing appeal as a secure and portable store of value. According to these expert opinions, both types of cryptocurrency play crucial roles. The ongoing debate of wrapped bitcoin versus bitcoin is more than a technical dispute. It is a battle over the very identity of digital money in an era of rapid innovation and political repositioning. As Donald Trump’s portfolio of digital tokens becomes increasingly intertwined with Ethereum-based assets, the “Bitcoin President” narrative may be a misnomer. Instead, for many, it signifies a fundamental shift in which the distinctions between blockchain platforms become increasingly blurred, and the President’s pursuit of personal gain may override ideological purity. Time will tell if Trump can claim credit as a true bitcoin patron or if Ethereum, and other smart contract layer ones, will take center stage. As the debate rages on, one thing is sure. The dynamic interplay between innovation, politics, and technology is transforming the face of money in our digital age. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

Title: Bitcoin price today: slips to $102k as Trump boost fades, $TRUMP tumbles

Investing.com-- Bitcoin slid on Thursday after a short-lived rally on hype over more crypto-friendly policies from President Donald Trump, with his recently launched memecoin also clocking steep losses. Cryptocurrency markets took fleeting support from the Securities and Exchange Commission, which, under new leadership, said it will form a task force to help advise on crypto regulation. Markets were left wanting as Trump did not sign any executive orders related to crypto in his first few days in office, despite several industry participants hoping for such a move. The launch of $TRUMP, which logged wild price swings since its debut, also contributed to additional volatility in markets, while hype over artificial intelligence saw risk-heavy traders turn more biased towards equity markets. Bitcoin fell 1.4% to $102,530.0 by 09:14 ET (14:14 GMT). The world’s biggest cryptocurrency briefly hit a record high above $109,000 before Trump’s inauguration this week, but has since logged steep declines. Bitcoin largely failed to maintain its gains this week, as optimism over crypto-friendly policies under Trump appeared to be short-lived. While the SEC announcement does herald some progress towards friendlier regulation, the commission provided few details on just what policies will be covered by its task force. The SEC also did not provide a timeline for new regulation. A major point of contention for crypto markets was also that Trump signed no crypto-related executive orders, while his threats of tariffs on major economies dented risk appetite. Trump’s memecoin- $TRUMP- slid nearly 13% to $35.27 on Thursday, sliding further from record highs of nearly $80 hit just after its launch. The token raised some concerns over the ethics of Trump using his influence to further his personal wealth. The President was seen largely avoiding questions over the billions of dollar of paper gains he had likely made from $TRUMP. Needham & Co. said that its proprietary ‘Crypto Euphoria Needham Diagram’ (CEND) has reached its highest levels since the index’s inception, signaling heightened market sentiment for cryptocurrencies and nearing “extreme euphoria.” The CEND index, which measures crypto market cycles using various metrics, rose to 64 this week, up from 55 in December 2024. While this marks a significant increase, it remains below the October 2021 peak of 82. “This week CEND reached its highest levels since we began publishing the index,” the firm noted. “Nearly every underlying metric we analyze to track the crypto cycle has gone higher following the Trump inauguration.” The index incorporates six key metrics, analyzing sentiment among retail, crypto-native, and institutional investors, alongside “risk on” indicators like the MVRV Z-score and Bitcoin dominance. BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) CEO Larry Fink offered some positive comments on Bitcoin, stating that he believed the crypto could rise to a $700,000 price if more people adopted it on concerns over the economic and political stability of their countries. Fink told Bloomberg that he believed in the utilization of Bitcoin as an internationally based instrument, although he clarified he was not promoting the crypto. BlackRock had last year launched an exchange-traded fund that tracked the spot price of Bitcoin- iShares Bitcoin Trust (NASDAQ:IBIT). The launch had initially attracted a deluge of capital flows in early-2024, although inflows have since floundered. Broader crypto prices fell in tandem with Bitcoin. World no.2 crypto Ether fell 1.8% to $3,227.73, while XRP retreated 2.4% to $3.089. Solana, Cardano, and Polygon sank between 1.8% and 5%, while among meme tokens, Dogecoin dropped 2.9%.

Title: EV maker VinFast's losses heap pressure on parent Vingroup as foreign investors sell

* Vingroup's shares close to multi-year lows, fall most among top Vietnam firms * Vingroup market cap has nearly halved since VinFast's Nasdaq listing * Agencies rate as junk the debt of Vingroup's most profitable unit * Vingroup says it remains committed to VinFast's growth By Francesco Guarascio and Phuong Nguyen HANOI, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Vietnamese conglomerate Vingroup is facing renewed scrutiny on its strategy of backing loss-making electric vehicle maker VinFast, with its shares near multi-year lows as foreign investors sell and its borrowing costs rise. Pressure on the company, a household name in Vietnam with businesses spanning autos, real estate, retail and resorts, intensified this month as Moody's and Fitch gave 'junk' ratings to the debt of Vingroup's most profitable unit, real estate firm Vinhomes, as well as to its planned $500 million international bond sale. The two agencies said the speculative-grade ratings were due to Vinhomes' links to Vingroup. This year "may become indicative of Vingroup's broader financial health," said Leif Schneider, head of international law firm Luther in Vietnam. "Vingroup may face further financial erosion" if VinFast's performance does not improve, he said, adding that scaling back Vingroup's support to subsidiaries could mitigate financial strain. The conglomerate and its founder, Pham Nhat Vuong, poured $13.5 billion into the electric automaker as of October in loans and grants, and promised another nearly $3.5 billion in November, despite concerns about the bet investors raised at the company's last two annual shareholders' meetings. Vingroup's market capitalisation has shrunk by nearly half to about $6 billion since VinFast's listing in August 2023. Over the past year, its shares fell 6.6%, the most among the 10 largest listed companies in Vietnam, and underperforming the 7.5% rise for the Vietnam market, according to LSEG data. Its shares traded in December at their lowest level since 2017. They have recovered slightly since but were still close to that multi-year low level this week. "The biggest challenge for Vingroup remains VinFast," said Nguyen The Minh, head of research at Yuanta Securities Vietnam. Vingroup, however, is not backing off. "Vingroup has been and will continue to support the subsidiary's development," it told Reuters on Wednesday, reiterating its long-standing commitment to Nasdaq-listed VinFast. Strong expected growth for its units this year would attract investment in the company, Vingroup said. BORROWING COSTS So far, investors, especially from overseas, have been unconvinced. Since VinFast's listing, the value of foreigners' combined holdings in Vingroup has dropped by nearly 60% to 15.7 trillion dong ($620.5 million), faster than local investors', according to stock market data updated to last week. Among foreigners who fully divested their holdings in the conglomerate last year are investment vehicles of BlackRock and DWS, while JPMorgan's asset management unit nearly halved its stake to 0.13%, according to LSEG data. Vingroup's largest foreign investor, South Korean conglomerate SK Group, is planning to sell by mid-February about one-fifth of its 6% holding as part of a possibly broader divestment plan in Southeast Asia. Vingroup said foreigners' net selling was a wider trend in Vietnam and Southeast Asia, driven largely by high interest rates in the United States. VinFast lost nearly $2 billion in the first three quarters of last year, latest data show, but is narrowing its losses as revenue grew thanks to car sales having exceeded its revised-down target last year. Vingroup's revenue and profits rose in the first nine months of last year compared to the same period in 2023, driven by the sale of assets. However, Vingroup's borrowing costs are rising steadily. In May, it issued two-year bonds that paid 12.5% interest, above the average 10.6% in 2023 and 9.6% in 2022 for slightly longer maturities. Vingroup is not rated, but Fitch estimated earlier in January that its debt was expected to be close to risk levels for Vinhomes' ratings "due to rising investments in the group's automaker, and our expectations of a sustained operating cash burn". "Consolidated net debt/net property assets at Vingroup is expected to be above 55% over the short term," Fitch said, noting that if it moved beyond 60% on a sustained basis, that could lead to the downgrade of Vinhomes' current rating, making its debt costlier. Vingroup said its debt remained at stable levels. Vietnamese lender Techcombank, which is one of Vingroup's largest creditors, did not reply to a request for comment. Despite having a manageable, low debt, "Vinhomes' credit quality is constrained by its growth ambitions and linkages with its parent, Vingroup," Moody's said.

Title: Japanese investors boost foreign stock purchases on Fed rate-cut hopes

(Reuters) - Japanese investors raised their holdings in foreign stocks, driven by a benign U.S. core inflation report that fuelled expectations of Federal Reserve cuts and boosted global equities, while a strong yen also lifted domestic buying power. They invested a net 489.8 billion yen ($3.13 billion) into overseas stocks, for a sixth straight week through Jan. 18, marking their second-largest weekly net purchase since Sept. 7, 2024, according to data from Japan's Ministry of Finance. Analysts noted that the investment in foreign stocks was also driven by increased flows into the new Nippon Individual Savings Accounts (NISA) programme, a tax-free investment scheme, and they expect such investments to persist through March. U.S. core inflation data for December reported a 3.2% increase last week, slightly below the forecast of 3.3%. Strong fourth-quarter earnings from major firms such as JPMorgan, BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) and Goldman Sachs lifted the MSCI World Index by 2.56%, marking its largest weekly gain since Nov. 8, 2024. Japan's market participants also acquired foreign debt securities of a net 1.01 trillion yen, the highest for a week since Nov. 9. They poured 819.3 billion yen into long-term bonds and 194.2 billion yen into short-term bills.

Title: EV maker VinFast's losses heap pressure on parent Vingroup as foreign investors sell

By Francesco Guarascio and Phuong Nguyen HANOI (Reuters) - Vietnamese conglomerate Vingroup is facing renewed scrutiny on its strategy of backing loss-making electric vehicle maker VinFast (NASDAQ:VFS), with its shares near multi-year lows as foreign investors sell and its borrowing costs rise. Pressure on the company, a household name in Vietnam with businesses spanning autos, real estate, retail and resorts, intensified this month as Moody's (NYSE:MCO) and Fitch gave 'junk' ratings to the debt of Vingroup's most profitable unit, real estate firm Vinhomes (HM:VHM), as well as to its planned $500 million international bond sale. The two agencies said the speculative-grade ratings were due to Vinhomes' links to Vingroup. This year "may become indicative of Vingroup's broader financial health," said Leif Schneider, head of international law firm Luther in Vietnam. "Vingroup may face further financial erosion" if VinFast's performance does not improve, he said, adding that scaling back Vingroup's support to subsidiaries could mitigate financial strain. The conglomerate and its founder, Pham Nhat Vuong, poured $13.5 billion into the electric automaker as of October in loans and grants, and promised another nearly $3.5 billion in November, despite concerns about the bet investors raised at the company's last two annual shareholders' meetings. Vingroup's market capitalisation has shrunk by nearly half to about $6 billion since VinFast's listing in August 2023. Over the past year, its shares fell 6.6%, the most among the 10 largest listed companies in Vietnam, and underperforming the 7.5% rise for the Vietnam market, according to LSEG data. Its shares traded in December at their lowest level since 2017. They have recovered slightly since but were still close to that multi-year low level this week. "The biggest challenge for Vingroup remains VinFast," said Nguyen The Minh, head of research at Yuanta Securities Vietnam. Vingroup, however, is not backing off. "Vingroup has been and will continue to support the subsidiary's development," it told Reuters on Wednesday, reiterating its long-standing commitment to Nasdaq-listed VinFast. Strong expected growth for its units this year would attract investment in the company, Vingroup said. BORROWING COSTS So far, investors, especially from overseas, have been unconvinced. Since VinFast's listing, the value of foreigners' combined holdings in Vingroup has dropped by nearly 60% to 15.7 trillion dong ($620.5 million), faster than local investors', according to stock market data updated to last week. Among foreigners who fully divested their holdings in the conglomerate last year are investment vehicles of BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) and DWS, while JPMorgan's asset management unit nearly halved its stake to 0.13%, according to LSEG data. Vingroup's largest foreign investor, South Korean conglomerate SK Group, is planning to sell by mid-February about one-fifth of its 6% holding as part of a possibly broader divestment plan in Southeast Asia. Vingroup said foreigners' net selling was a wider trend in Vietnam and Southeast Asia, driven largely by high interest rates in the United States. VinFast lost nearly $2 billion in the first three quarters of last year, latest data show, but is narrowing its losses as revenue grew thanks to car sales having exceeded its revised-down target last year. Vingroup's revenue and profits rose in the first nine months of last year compared to the same period in 2023, driven by the sale of assets. However, Vingroup's borrowing costs are rising steadily. In May, it issued two-year bonds that paid 12.5% interest, above the average 10.6% in 2023 and 9.6% in 2022 for slightly longer maturities. Vingroup is not rated, but Fitch estimated earlier in January that its debt was expected to be close to risk levels for Vinhomes' ratings "due to rising investments in the group's automaker, and our expectations of a sustained operating cash burn". "Consolidated net debt/net property assets at Vingroup is expected to be above 55% over the short term," Fitch said, noting that if it moved beyond 60% on a sustained basis, that could lead to the downgrade of Vinhomes' current rating, making its debt costlier. Vingroup said its debt remained at stable levels. Vietnamese lender Techcombank, which is one of Vingroup's largest creditors, did not reply to a request for comment. Despite having a manageable, low debt, "Vinhomes' credit quality is constrained by its growth ambitions and linkages with its parent, Vingroup," Moody's said.

REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon/File Photo Japanese investors raised their holdings in foreign stocks, driven by a benign U.S. core inflation report that fuelled expectations of Federal Reserve cuts and boosted global equities, while a strong yen also lifted domestic buying power. They invested a net 489.8 billion yen ($3.13 billion) into overseas stocks, for a sixth straight week through Jan. 18, marking their second-largest weekly net purchase since Sept. 7, 2024, according to data from Japan's Ministry of Finance. Analysts noted that the investment in foreign stocks was also driven by increased flows into the new Nippon Individual Savings Accounts (NISA) programme, a tax-free investment scheme, and they expect such investments to persist through March. U.S. core inflation data for December reported a 3.2 per cent increase last week, slightly below the forecast of 3.3 per cent. Strong fourth-quarter earnings from major firms such as JPMorgan, BlackRock and Goldman Sachs lifted the MSCI World Index by 2.56 per cent, marking its largest weekly gain since Nov. 8, 2024. Japan's market participants also acquired foreign debt securities of a net 1.01 trillion yen, the highest for a week since Nov. 9. They poured 819.3 billion yen into long-term bonds and 194.2 billion yen into short-term bills. At the same time, Japanese stocks witnessed a marginal 66.1 billion yen worth of foreign outflows last week, contrasting 259.1 billion yen in inflows in the previous week.

Larry Fink stated that sovereign wealth funds are looking to allocate 2% to 5% in Bitcoin. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink believes that Bitcoin (BTC) could soar to $700,000 if global economic and political instability prompts widespread adoption of the flagship crypto. Fink made the prediction while speaking on a panel at the World Economic Forum on Jan. 22. He outlined a scenario in which Bitcoin becomes a refuge for wealth preservation amid turmoil. He also said that he is a “big believer” in Bitcoin because it is an “internationally based instrument” that can protect people from currency debasement and economic instability. According to Fink: “If people across countries experiencing political and economic turmoil turn to Bitcoin to protect their purchasing power, we could see an unprecedented surge.” He said his projections are based on the fact that BlackRock’s clients, including major investment funds and asset managers, are increasingly inquiring about Bitcoin allocations. Fink revealed: “I was with a sovereign wealth fund during this week and that’s what we talked about, that was the conversation: should we have a 2% allocation, should we have a 5% allocation?” Fink added that his remarks are not intended to promote investments in Bitcoin but shed light on the current perspective of institutional clients. He noted that widespread adoption of such strategies could drive Bitcoin’s value to $500,000, $600,000, or even $700,000. BlackRock recently published a report stating that Bitcoin adoption is outpacing other tech innovations, such as the internet and mobile phones. The report highlighted rising inflation, geopolitical tensions, and concerns over traditional banking systems as the main drivers of this rapid growth. Moreover, BlackRock increased by 117% the number of IBIT shares acquired through its Global Allocation Fund in the last quarter, totaling 430,770 shares. Notably, BlackRock is the issuer of the world’s largest spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), the IBIT. Farside Investors data reveals that IBIT has over $39 billion of net positive flows as of Jan. 21. Additionally, it became the top ETF of the decade, surpassing all its rivals’ inflows. Brian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase, recently stated that he had conversations with finance ministers of different countries who were considering creating strategic Bitcoin reserves if the US moves in this direction. According to Armstrong, the sovereign interest in BTC is one of the drivers that could propel its price to the “multiple millions price range.” It all depends on Bitcoin becoming the new gold standard, appealing to investors in multiple countries and boosting adoption.

Fink sat alongside Peng Xiao, CEO of UAE-based artificial intelligence company G42, when the conversation about AI turned to crypt. Xiao indicated that he believes crypto is the currency of AI, while Fink said it's a hedge against inflation and pessimism about what's happening in the world. “As I became a student of crypto, it was very clear to me that crypto is a currency of fear,” said Fink. “But that’s OK. If you’re frightened of the debasement of your currency, or the economic or political stability of your country, you can have an international-based instrument called Bitcoin that can overcome those local fears.” He shared a similar sentiment last July, suggesting that Bitcoin was an investment for those “frightened of the world.” But it’s an investment that many are considering making, including the operators of a sovereign wealth fund that Fink met with while in Switzerland earlier this week. Fink said they were debating whether to have a 2% or 5% allocation to Bitcoin. “If everybody adopted that conversation,” he said, “it would be $500,000, $600,000, $700,000 for Bitcoin.” However, Fink cheekily told the audience that his words were not intended as a promotion of Bitcoin. Fink and BlackRock have become deeply intertwined with crypto assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum thanks to their spot ETF offerings for both assets, which have experienced billions in inflows during the last year. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF, or IBIT, eventually grew large enough to overtake its gold ETF in assets under management. Bitcoin is down 2.5% in the last 24 hours to $104,000, after setting a new all-time high price of $108,786 on Monday.

Title: Why Companies Are Ditching ESG

ESG John Stossel | 1.22.2025 4:15 PM "Sustainability" investments became popular a few years back. So-called experts said companies shouldn't just focus on profit. They should put more effort into being "nice." Funds pushing ESG (environmental, social, and governance) were all the rage. Giant investment firms like BlackRock pressured companies to hire more women and minorities. CEO Larry Fink announced, "All investments are going to be looked through sustainability." But "sustainability" is a mostly meaningless word. Parnassus claimed it helped meet United Nations sustainability goals of "nutrition" and "sanitation" by investing in U.S. Foods and Clorox. Starbucks phased out plastic straws while adding lids that used more plastic. BP rebranded itself as "Beyond Petroleum." Wisely, it mostly invested in petroleum. Former Vice President Al Gore made money peddling climate change hysteria. He created "sustainability investment funds," claiming "sustainability factors…actually enhance returns!" His funds did enhance Gore's own returns; he made millions. But over the past three years, his "sustainable" fund underperformed the stock market. Recently the fund managers admitted they "made investment mistakes." Most funds promoting "sustainable investment" did worse than the market. So, why did trillions of dollars pour into such funds? "Because of pressures," says Matt Cole, CEO of Strive Investments, in my new video. "Their largest clients are blue states' pension [funds] like CalPERS and the New York pension [fund] who put pressure on them: 'Adopt these agendas or you're going to lose us as your largest customer!'" CalPERS still brags about "mitigating climate risk" and adding "climate-conscious board members" to Exxon's board. Presidential Climate Envoy John Kerry pompously bullied banks: "They will invest into climate-related efforts," he intoned. Today, banks and even BlackRock are running from sustainability nonsense. "What you're seeing," says Cole, "is ESG funds shuttering at record speed…and they're not apologizing." Progressives never do. This fad didn't just hurt investors; it hurt companies that America needs. America needs high-performance computer chips. Intel was once the leading manufacturer of such chips. But now, even as Congress gives Intel billions in taxpayer handouts, the company is cutting thousands of jobs. Why? While Intel's competitors innovated, Intel obsessed about "sustainability." Intel's website lists endless ESG goals like "environmental, health, wellness, and safety programs to care for people and the planet." It even brags about "green software," whatever that is. That's a lot of energy spent not making the best chip. When companies spend time sucking up to politicians rather than innovating, they often decline. Intel's stock fell 60 percent last year. Fortunately, today more companies are focusing on basic capitalism—producing better products for less money. Ford recently announced it will no longer require employees to take LGBTQ advocacy group surveys. USA Today reports that Lowe's will reduce its participation with the Human Rights Campaign to "narrow its focus to safe and affordable housing." When I was co-host of 20/20, I wondered what would happen when Disney bought ABC. Not much changed for a while. But a few years later, after repeatedly rejecting videos I proposed about problems with Obamacare, ABC fired me. Still later, I laughed as I watched Disney go full woke. The president of the entertainment content division said, "We have many, many, many LGBTQIA characters in our stories, and yet we don't have enough leads." Disney's television animation producer added, "I was just, wherever I could, adding queerness." But many such movies flopped. The Marvels, featuring a Muslim teen and black female sidekick, lost $237 million. Lightyear, featuring the first same-sex kiss in a Disney-Pixar movie, lost $106 million. Elemental, featuring a nonbinary character (a lake with earrings), didn't even reach $30 million it's opening week. Now Disney's quietly scaling back. More companies have started to recognize a need to focus on their core business rather than virtue-signaling. "It's the beginnings of an unwind," says Cole, "that I think is going to be critical for us to achieve success." I wonder why they were so dumb in the first place.

Title: Blackrock CEO Calls Crypto a ‘Currency of Fear’ (Complimentary)

Blackrock CEO Larry Fink thinks bitcoin, which is currently priced at around $104,200, could go as high as $700,000. But that’s only if people get really nervous about the stability of their own currencies around the world. And while it’s anyone’s guess whether Fink’s logic is sound and people would indeed flock to crypto in times of crisis (that extremely common thesis hasn’t yet been proved), it’s certainly true that the election of Donald Trump has the potential to inject plenty of instability into the global economic landscape. Fink made the prediction about bitcoin’s future price on Wednesday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, while discussing the outlook of technologies like artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency with Bloomberg. Fink had previously been a skeptic of crypto in the late 2010s, saying back in 2017 that, “Bitcoin just shows you how much demand for money laundering there is in the world.” But the billionaire changed his mind in more recent years, becoming a true believer in the promise of crypto by 2021. Fink seems to not only believe that crypto is now a positive thing, but that this reliance on fear is actually an asset. The billionaire thinks people can make a lot of money from instability or at least the worries over instability around the world. “As I became a student of crypto, it was very clear to me that crypto is a currency of fear. And that’s okay,” Fink during the panel Wednesday that’s available on YouTube. Fink was sharing the stage with Peng Xiao, the CEO of AI company G42, who interjected with “to some extent” on Fink’s contention that fear drives bitcoin. But Fink just doubled down on the idea that it was “okay” for bitcoin’s fortunes to rely on fear. “If you’re frightened of your debasement of your currency or you’re frightened of your economic or political stability of your country, you could have an internationally-based instrument called bitcoin that will overcome those local fears. And so I’m a big believer in the utilization of that as an instrument,” said Fink. Fink went on to say that bitcoin’s price could reach “$500,000, $600,000, $700,000 per Bitcoin” while emphasizing “I’m not promoting that, by the way.” Fink also said that he believed bonds and stocks should be “tokenized.” Why? That part isn’t clear, since it makes no fucking sense. But why not? We went through this same bullshit hype cycle a few years ago when everyone jumped on the NFT bandwagon and tokenizing things that didn’t need to be tokenized may very well have another resurgence. “The fact that we are not moving forward in tokenization, every bond and stock is crazy,” said Fink. “We should be moving towards that frontier. Obviously, there’s winners and losers and all that. But we need to be prepared for the tokenization. And it would democratize more finance if we tokenized bonds and stocks.” Fink also discussed the power needs of the enormous data centers that continue to be built around the world to serve the needs of AI. Those data centers require a great amount of power, which Fink addressed by talking about nuclear power as a potential fix. “We need a lot of energy partners to be able to make this a viable global undertaking,” Fink said. “And hopefully this raises a conversation about what role nuclear play in the energy mix.” Fink gave a nod to renewables, saying they would be part of the mix, but said that “unless fusion actually works and we have new sources of power,” there’s a need to work with what’s available. There are some big questions about the future of the U.S. economy that are currently getting hashed out at Davos and beyond. Inflation, for instance, doesn’t seem to be something the ruling class is too scared about anymore, despite the 2024 U.S. presidential election essentially hinging on whether a new president would be able to get prices down. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon was asked about Trump’s plans for across the board tariffs against Mexico and Canada, which are expected to get implemented around Feb. 1. And Dimon, who’s worth $2.7 billion, seemed very chill about the prospect. âIf itâs a little inflationary, but itâs good for national security, so be it. I mean, get over it,â Dimon told CNBC’s Andrew Ross Sorkin on Wednesday. That does sound like a good mantra for the wealthy in this new era of Trump: So be it, get over it. We’re probably going to be hearing that a lot if Trump manages to torpedo the economy. That’s probably not what most Trump supporters thought they were signing up for when they cast a vote for the 47th president. But that’s certainly what they’re going to get.

Title: Has The US Treasury Created An XRP Wallet? Unveiling The Truth
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/us-treasury-xrp-wallet-unveiling-the-truth/
Time Published: 2025-01-22T19:30:37Z
Full Content:
Rumors of the US Treasury’s alleged foray onto the XRP Ledger (XRPL) have been circulating, sparking buzz across the digital asset community. On January 21, several community accounts on X claimed that an address linked to “home.treasury.gov” had surfaced on the ledger, creating trustlines with well-known financial institutions such as Bank of America, BlackRock, and JPMorgan. However, a deeper look under the hood has uncovered a series of red flags indicating that the wallet in question is neither authentic nor affiliated with the US Treasury. Community member Echo X (@echodatruth), took to X to debunk the rumor through a detailed video breakdown. In the video, he explained that there are many red flags with the wallet. “If you go XRP Scan and you put in the wallet address, you will notice that they have not only just all of these different tokens from Bank of America, BlackRock, and JP Morgan, which again, that’s already a red flag, but you can notice they have 16,000 XRP that has been deposited into this wallet by people just sending it over to the Treasury. Or what they think is the [Treasury].” According to Echo X, any user can easily verify these discrepancies by exploring the wallet on XRPL scanners such as XRPScan or Bithomp. He and other developers from BuildX and the ERS team identified an unusual pattern of newly issued “Bank of America,” “BlackRock,” and “JPMorgan” tokens, all minted by the same address—strong indicators that the tokens are not legitimate. Public data from Bithomp shows that the suspect wallet was activated on January 21 at 3:17 UTC, after which it promptly set its domain to the official US Treasury address, home.treasury.gov—a move observers believe was intended to appear legitimate. Notably, the wallet received 1 trillion units of each of the so-called “Bank of America,” “BlackRock,” and “JPMorgan” tokens, placed multiple sell orders for tens of millions of these tokens in exchange for XRP and used questionable domain references, including an apparently invalid “BRICS domain.” Echo X highlighted that users who looked deeper into the provenance of these tokens would discover their suspicious origins. He noted: “Now, if you actually click on it and you see what the Genesis wallets are … it leads you to a BRICS domain wallet. … That BRICS domain is not even a valid domain. Why would the BRICS be creating a wallet?” Further compounding doubts, data shows the wallet’s trustlines were created around newly issued tokens that hold no official backing. In one notable transaction, the address placed an order to trade 299 million JPMorgan tokens for 33.23 million XRP, at an exchange rate of 0.11 XRP per token, raising more eyebrows about its authenticity. The rumor gained traction when it appeared on XRPScan that the addresses in question had some form of verification tag—an aspect that typically shows that a wallet has completed a Know Your Customer (KYC) process. However, Wietse Wind, founder of Xaman (formerly Xumm), clarified that verification on XRPScan simply indicates whether the account holders have submitted personal data, not that they represent any particular entity. Wind noted via X: “The domain field is a public field on an account on the blockchain, anyone can enter anything there. Issued tokens can be issued by anyone. KYC can be done by anyone. … XRPScan shows data that lives on the ledger. This data lives on the ledger. […] They are all in fact KYC’d. By different people, all from the Philippines. So there we have it. KYC helps, but it’s still no guarantee.” Wind’s remarks underscore that the KYC process is limited to verifying an individual’s identity. It does not confirm that person’s affiliation with an organization, such as the US Treasury or any major bank. Effectively, a user can label a wallet “Treasury,” mint tokens named after financial institutions, and set a domain to a high-profile website without actually representing those entities. In his video, Echo X urged community members to remain vigilant and avoid sending XRP to questionable addresses simply on the basis of domain labels or speculation: “Again, shout out to the BuildX and ERS community and team and developers … because they’re trying to save you. … Make sure you do your own research and know what you hold.” At press time, XRP traded at $3.17 For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: BlackRock CEO Larry Fink Says Bitcoin Could Run to $700,000 if Sovereign Wealth Funds Begin Allocating

The CEO of the largest asset manager in the world says that Bitcoin (BTC) could see drastically higher prices if sovereign wealth funds begin accumulating. Speaking with Bloomberg at the World Economic Forum (WEF) event in Davos, Switzerland, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink says that sovereign wealth funds may drive the price of Bitcoin higher as they look to hedge against “local fears” such as inflation and political or economic uncertainty. “If you’re frightened of the debasement of your currency or you’re frightened of the economic or political stability of your country, you can have an internationally based instrument called Bitcoin that will overcome those local fears. And so I’m a big believer in the utilization of that as an instrument, and so if that becomes true and you see that it could be a proper hedge against hope securities or equities, the question is, could you see it be a 2% or 5% allocation? I was with a sovereign wealth fund during this week and that was the conversation. Should we have a 2% allocation? Should we have a 5% allocation? If everybody adopted that conversation, it would be $500,000, $600,000, $700,000 per Bitcoin.” Fink’s BlackRock has embraced Bitcoin over the last year, building a $50 billion stash to back its iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) which went live in early 2024. In November, it was found that IBIT had surpassed BlackRock’s gold ETF (IAU) in terms of net assets – reaching over $33 billion – despite the gold ETF launching nearly two decades earlier in 2005. At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $104,607.

Investing.com -- Speaking to Bloomberg at the World Economic Forum in Davos, BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) CEO Larry Fink said he believes Bitcoin could rise to $700,000. Fink said he is a “big believer in the utilization” of Bitcoin as an instrument, explaining that those worried about the debasement of their currencies or the economic or political stability of their countries can have an “internationally based instrument called Bitcoin.” It will “overcome those local fears,” he added. He continued that when speaking with a sovereign wealth fund earlier in the week, the conversation centered on whether they should have a 2% or 5% allocation to Bitcoin. “If everybody adopted that conversation, it would be $500,000, $600,000, $700,000 per Bitcoin,” declared Fink. However, he clarified: “I am not promoting it by the way. That is not my promotion.” In December last year it was reported that BlackRock said in a report it recommends investors consider an allocation of as much as 2% of their portfolio in Bitcoin. “Bitcoin’s role as a store of value and payments system make it a potential diversifier,” said Samara Cohen, Chief Investment Officer (CIO) of ETFs and Index Investments at BlackRock. Given its unique value drivers, we see no intrinsic reason why bitcoin should be correlated with major risk assets over the long term,” the BlackRock report stated.

Title: ByteDance director confident TikTok deal will get done, sees options to avoid an outright sale
URL: https://nypost.com/2025/01/22/business/bytedance-director-confident-tiktok-deal-will-get-done-sees-options-to-avoid-a-sale/
Time Published: 2025-01-22T17:59:42Z
Full Content:
A major shareholder of ByteDance, the Beijing-based owner of TikTok, said Wednesday he was confident that a deal will be reached to ensure the video-sharing app stays online in the US — and suggested there may be options “short of divestiture” on the table. TikTok received a lifeline this week from President Trump, who issued an executive order delaying enforcement of a national ban by 75 days while China-based ByteDance seeks an American buyer. The app remains online after a brief shutdown last weekend. Bill Ford, CEO of ByteDance shareholder General Atlantic, who also sits on the TikTok parent’s board of directors, said “it’s in everybody’s interest” to hammer out an agreement following Trump’s order. “We’ll get on with it, as soon as maybe the end of the week in terms of negotiating what might work,” Ford told Axios during an event at the annual World Economic Summit in Davos, Switzerland. “The Chinese government, the US government and the company and the board all have to be involved in this conversation.” Ford also said there might be terms “short of divestiture” that would satisfy US authorities, but did not elaborate. He also placed blame on the Biden administration for not “engaging with us on a real dialogue” before the Jan. 19 divestiture deadline. The Chinese government, which long vowed to block any forced sale of TikTok, changed its tune this week and signaled the company should be allowed to explore a potential deal. General Atlantic and Blackrock are among multiple institutional investors that collectively own a 60% chunk of ByteDance. The company says its executives and employees each own 20%. Trump has vowed to “save TikTok” and said he wants the US to receive a 50% ownership stake in the app as part of a joint venture, though the exact details of his plan remain vague. On Tuesday, Trump said he would be open to his close adviser Elon Musk, who already owns the social media platform X, making a bid to buy TikTok. Trump also invited Oracle executive chairman Larry Ellison, whose company is a cloud computing partner for TikTok, to get involved. Other potential buyers include a joint bid floated by billionaire Frank McCourt and “Shark Tank” star Kevin O’Leary, who have said they have $20 billion in commitments as part of a plan to buy the TikTok brand and rebuild its algorithm from scratch on US soil. Another group that includes YouTube star Jimmy “Mr. Beast” Donaldson and Employer.com CEO Jesse Tinsley is also looking to buy TikTok. Former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has said he is interested in investing in TikTok but said he had paused any bid to buy the app outright, while ex-Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick also was said to be exploring an acquisition in recent months. Any buyer would face an uphill battle to meet the criteria of the bipartisan-pushed law, which requires China to divest ownership of TikTok due to concerns about US national security. China hawks, including Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), have said any link to the Chinese Communist Party would need to be entirely eliminated. US lawmakers and the federal government say TikTok is effectively a spying and propaganda tool capable of mass data collection and influencing public opinion through its algorithm. The Supreme Court unanimously upheld the law two days before the deadline, rejecting ByteDance’s argument that it violated the First Amendment. As The Post reported, TikTok remains unavailable in app stores operated by major tech firms Apple, Google, Microsoft and Amazon. Under the divestiture law, US companies that facilitate access to TikTok face fines of $5,000 per user. That would amount to as much as $850 billion, given TikTok’s American user base of 170 million.

Title: Building The Business Case For Growth Investment

A Better Formula For Funding and Executing Commercial Transformation Kristen Carloni leads the global Business Proposal Strategy team for Aladdin Sales and Marketing, a B2B technology business within BlackRock. Her responsibilities center around ensuring an impactful and scalable business proposal process for selling the firm’s financial technology products. From that perch, her team directly impacts the majority of revenues in the business. “The most important, biggest deals come through my team,” says Carloni. “So as a baseline if we don’t do our job the firm is never going to see that revenue, it’s just going to die on the vine.” While Business Proposal Strategy conveys the workings of her job, Kristen’s role defies conventional description. In practice she works across marketing, product, IT and sales functions to leverage technology and AI in ways that help her firm drive faster, more profitable and scalable growth. In other words, she’s a poster child for what is emerging as the next generation of growth leader, a Revenue Operations executive. The description is apt because Kristen is working across silos to better connect teams, data, technology and processes to: 1. Generate more consistent, reliable and profitable revenue growth 2. Improve the return on growth investments in sales, marketing and customer programs 3. Maximize the return on commercial assets like brand, channels, innovation and knowledge assets She’s doing this with a small team of under a dozen people who are impacting over 90 percent of the revenues in the business. At the same time she’s helping the people responsible for the rest of the revenue be more effective in their jobs. And she's in the best position, most importantly, to leverage AI multiplier to drive more scalable revenue growth. A big reason she is so effective is she has adopted the principles and platforms of Strategic Response Management (SRM) which is defined as the people, practice and technology to unlock organizational knowledge for profit growth. Every sales operations, marketing operations, or sales enablement executive can learn a lot from Kristen about creating, quantifying, and communicating the financial impact commercial transformation can have on the business. Why? Because she’s used the principles of Revenue Operations to effectively unlock more of the full potential of the growth investments and assets of her business. And she’s done it from what seems on the surface as a relatively back office “cost center” stuck in the middle of the revenue cycle - the bid and proposal response team. A BETTER BUSINESS CASE FOR COMMERCIAL TRANSFORMATION Generating more consistent and profitable revenue - Unlike typical sales and marketing operations teams, Kristen’s team has the advantage of directly impacting top line revenues. That makes a big difference when it comes to leading commercial transformation in the eyes of leadership. The average B2B response team directly impacts almost one half (48%) of revenues in terms of both customer acquisition (via RFPs) and loyalty and expansion (via Due Diligence Questionnaires) according to APMP benchmarks. They also drive additional revenue by providing market intelligence, self-service knowledgebases, customer insight, and knowledge assets that help improve the overall go-to-market process. As evidence, Carloni’s team has leveraged technology to grow the percent of revenues they directly impact from 70% to 92% of revenues in the past year – with greater productivity, performance and at lower cost. They’ve effectively used the insights and experience drawn from responding to hundreds of customers to inform and improve the efforts of the product, marketing, finance, and sales teams in many ways. Calculating the Probability of winning. Showing where to allocate resources. Identifying the top features customers want. Forecasting future demand 24 months out. Reporting which marketing messages are landing or not. And more. Here are some examples: Improving the return on growth investment. As compelling as these returns are, many sales leaders make the mistake of treating sales productivity as a single solution problem, according to Bob Kelly, the CEO of the Sales Management Association. Instead Kelly advises managers to treat commercial transformation as an equilibrium problem that involves constantly balancing some fundamental tradeoffs such as investing in salesperson up-skilling versus simplifying the selling job; undergoing wholesale transformation versus pursuing incremental process improvements. Kristen Carloni has struck that balance in her efforts to transform the commercial model one dollar at a time at Blackrock. “Our ability to impact sales win rates, productivity, capacity and costs is just the tip of the iceberg in terms of the financial impact we’ve delivered when you compare it to the multiplier effect it has had on the return we are getting from our selling assets, IP, and investments,” says Carloni. Academic research reinforces Carloni’s focus on maximizing the return on commercial investments at lower risk. Business leaders that understand the math of growth in a modern business realize that far greater financial impact can be had by managing the allocation and deployment of growth resources, investments and assets such as building customer and brand equity, while mitigating the risks associated with selling. Maximizing the return on commercial assets. Perhaps the biggest financial impact a commercial transformation leader like Carloni can have is to unlock the enormous untapped growth potential of the firms commercial assets. Why? Because the majority of the value in firms is intangible commercial assets – including market-based assets, knowledge assets, computerized information, innovative property, and economic competencies like ‘sales know how.’ When properly measured and accounted for, these intangible assets can represent up to 80% or more of the value of a business.

January 22, 2025 09:05 ET | Source: Unlimited Unlimited NEW YORK, Jan. 22, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Unlimited, an asset management firm and ETF sponsor that uses proprietary technology to provide low-cost, alternative strategies to a variety of investors, today published its Q4 2024 Hedge Fund Barometer, showing that heading into 2025 hedge fund managers are positioned conservatively while waiting on market uncertainty to play out. According to the Barometer, the industry’s low conviction levels could be underpinned by reluctance to chase the run-up in assets observed in 2024 or make aggressive bets on weakening assets. Overall, the hedge fund industry posted a modestly positive performance in the fourth quarter of 2024, with overall gross returns of 0.9%, according to Unlimited’s proprietary technology. Event Driven strategies led the quarter with an impressive 2.8% gross return, while Emerging Markets strategies struggled, declining by -2.1% gross. Hedge fund performance in 4Q24 was bolstered by strategic positioning around key global events. Event Driven and Global Macro managers benefited from investments aligned with expectations surrounding Donald Trump’s re-election in November. In contrast, Emerging Markets managers faced headwinds due to the absence of anticipated Chinese economic stimulus, contributing to the underperformance of the strategy. Caution Amidst Euphoria Heading into 2025 Looking ahead, hedge fund managers are displaying caution as they approach 2025. Thematically, the Industry seems to be in “wait-and-see” mode, with managers largely maintaining exposure levels near long-term averages across major asset classes. 2024 Performance Recap Despite a modest fourth quarter, the hedge fund industry closed 2024 with an estimated 12% gross return (~8% net of fees). Equity strategies stood out, with both Long/Short and Event Driven funds outperforming industry averages. Managed Futures lagged, delivering returns below cash after fees. While industry returns in 2024 exceeded the long-term average by 300-400 basis points, they fell short of the extraordinary performance seen in equity markets during the same period.Key Industry Insights: Positioning Outlook As hedge funds enter 2025, managers appear to be holding firepower awaiting clearer market and economic signals.

Title: Inside A Real Estate Billionaire’s Fight To Revive His Aging Empire
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/giacomotognini/2025/01/22/inside-a-real-estate-billionaires-fight-to-revive-his-aging-empire/
Time Published: 2025-01-22T12:15:19Z
Full Content:
OnJanuary 15, real estate billionaire Charles Cohen called Forbes from a no caller ID phone, as he always does. For four months, Forbes had been trying to get Cohen to sit down and discuss the mounting debt and vacancies at the buildings owned by his real estate firm, Cohen Brothers Realty. In September he said to check back in November. In November, he said to call in January. Last week, Cohen said he was going on vacation. He didn’t specify where, but he often jets to his vineyard in the south of France, Château de Chausse, or his Palm Beach penthouse. (He also has apartments in West Hollywood and Manhattan and a sprawling home in Greenwich, Connecticut.) Then he asked if the story could be delayed once again for four to six weeks, when he would explain how his firm had “turned the corner.” “If you run a negative story, it's going to hurt me,” he said, mentioning several refinancings and new leases he claimed were in the works. “It makes it harder for us to rent when people think there's a problem that really isn't a problem." Cohen finally relented, only after Forbes explained the story would run regardless, and had his executive vice president sit down with Forbes to go over financials. There is no doubt that Cohen, who took over his father and uncles’ firm in the 1980s and expanded it by building and buying prime office towers in midtown Manhattan, now finds himself in a tricky spot. Since the pandemic emptied offices, many of his prized properties lost tenants. At least six of his buildings sit more than 20% empty, with three of those less than 60% occupied. At the same time, he’s struggled to make payments on at least $1.1 billion in debt according to loan filings and court documents, resulting in the loss of four properties at a foreclosure auction in November. All of that has dealt a blow to Cohen and his fortune, which peaked at $3.7 billion in 2022, when he was flush with cash and interest rates were near zero. Forbes now estimates he’s worth $1.6 billion. About two-thirds of that lies in his real estate holdings, which have lost value as tenants fled to newer, amenity-rich skyscrapers. Cohen disputes the valuation, claiming it should be higher. Steven Cherniak, Cohen Brothers’ chief operating officer, said that the firm is up-to-date on loan payments for buildings that carry more than half that $1.1 billion debt load. Plus, Cherniak is confident the properties will land more tenants in the first half of this year. Cohen’s troubles made headlines on November 8th, when one of the largest foreclosure auctions in New York history took place. Up for sale were five of his holdings: an 800,000-square foot office and design complex in Dania Beach, Florida, a nearby Le Meridien hotel, a former hotel site in Rye Brook, New York, and theater chains in the U.S. and the U.K. At the end of the bidding process, Cohen’s creditor, Fortress Investment Group, walked away with nearly everything, paying just under $150 million for the design complex, hotel, U.K. theater chain and Rye Brook site. No one bothered to bid on the U.S. chain Landmark Theaters, with its 28 locations and concessions business, leaving them in Cohen’s hands. It was the latest episode in a long-running battle between Cohen and Fortress. The lender sued Cohen last March, seeking repayment of a $534 million loan secured by the properties. Representatives for Fortress didn’t respond to a request for comment. Cohen and his company counter-sued. The auction, for which Cohen was a no show, was another setback for the real estate mogul and movie buff. For years, the collection of office towers in midtown Manhattan he’d assembled provided steady profits. He then expanded into design centers and indulged his passion for film, producing several Oscar-nominated films (and one best foreign-language film winner, “The Salesman”), buying arthouse theater chains and launching a film distribution business. He also bought a 135-acre vineyard and estate in France in 2016 and men's high-end footwear brand Harry’s of London a year later. But in the past two years, he’s had to deal with mounting troubles at his office towers. He lost several major tenants—including WeWork, which vacated more than 200,000 square feet at several properties while keeping much less space—and debts racked up as repayment dates loomed. His buildings struggled to compete with brand new skyscrapers with luxury amenities, making it tougher to replace those leases, according to several brokers. High interest rates also made it harder to refinance, and when he did—as with the Fortress loan—it was on unfavorable terms. At the same time, the rest of his empire also took a hit. The pandemic shuttered his theaters across the country, and his design centers lost tenants, too: he lost the one in Florida to Fortress but has three more, including two in Los Angeles and New York where occupancy has dipped below 80%. For his part, Cohen insists the picture isn’t as bad as it looks, pointing to better leasing activity and a recent uptick in sales of office buildings. At one of his properties, 750 Lexington Avenue—home to the headquarters of his firm—the lender filed for foreclosure in May, a month after the building was reappraised at just $50 million, down from $300 million in 2015. But the foreclosure has stalled, while one tenant, beauty retailer Sephora, renewed its lease and another tenant, WeWork, kept its lease after emerging from bankruptcy. Cohen Brothers is working on a loan modification with the lender. “We're doing fine. We've got leasing challenges, which everyone has, but we've got good buildings,” Cohen told Forbes in a phone call 10 days after the auction in November. “We have very strong tenant retention and expansion, and we're probably doing more leasing than a lot of other people.” Outside of New York, he’s expecting to break ground soon on a 23-story, glass-clad office tower in West Palm Beach, where demand for office space remains strong, especially for new buildings. “I'm doing everything that I need to do everywhere,” he asserted. Cohen's 750 Lexington Avenue, a 28-story tower with tenants including Sephora and WeWork, is 27% vacant and was reappraised in April 2024 at $50 million, down from $300 million in 2015. Cohen was born in 1952 into a real estate family in Harrison, north of New York City. His father, Sherman, was a former car dealer who built Cohen Brothers Realty with his two brothers; the siblings eventually grew it to more than 20 buildings across Manhattan. As a young child, Cohen was more interested in show business, developing a love for movies after his grandmother took him to see Cinderella at age 3. By the time he was a teenager, Cohen was showing apartments for his family’s real estate firm. But he also knew he wanted to become a director and even shot a few short films. “When I turned 14, I stopped following the Yankees and started reading Variety,” he told Forbes in 2017. “There was nothing more exciting to me than being in line to see a movie when it opened.” It would be a while before he pursued his filmmaking dreams. The first in his family to graduate from college, he got his bachelor’s at Tufts University in 1974 and a law degree from Brooklyn Law School in 1977 before working in Chemical Bank's real estate division in New York for a couple of years. He then joined his family’s firm and rose to become vice president and general counsel by 1981. Just two years later, he became president and bought out his father’s and uncle’s stakes in the company for an undisclosed sum. One of his signature deals was the construction of 750 Lexington Avenue. Cohen bought up the entire block between 59th and 60th streets in the 1980s to build it. (One resident on the block held out and refused to sell her townhouse, leading Cohen to build the 28-story tower around it; it’s still there) Cohen expanded into design centers in the 1990s, purchasing the Decoration and Design building in Manhattan for $63 million in 1996 and adding the Pacific Design Center in Los Angeles and the Design Center of the Americas in Florida three years later for an undisclosed sum. By 2009, he had expanded the firm to more than 12 million square feet of real estate—up from 3 million when he took over in the 1980s. At the time, he also pivoted back to his fervor for filmmaking. He put up half the budget for the independent film “Frozen River,” which won the Sundance Film Festival Grand Jury Prize in 2008, and then set up a movie distribution business the same year. Over the following decade, he picked up a historic film collection, a small-screen theater in Manhattan plus Landmark and Curzon, two theater chains in the U.S. and the U.K. He also began spending more time in France, purchasing the Château de Chausse wine estate in Provence in 2016 for $20 million and picking up a historic Japanese-style theater in Paris a year later. He joined The Forbes 400 list of richest Americans for the first time in 2016 with an estimated $2.8 billion net worth. That same year, coworking outfit WeWork leased four floors at Cohen's office tower on East 57th St. By 2018, the startup had expanded to 123,000 square feet there and also took more than 80,000 square feet at 750 Lexington. When WeWork’s public listing collapsed in September 2019, Cohen was left with a looming leasing problem as the startup’s cash was predicted to dry up. Six months later, the Covid-19 pandemic hit. The downturn was devastating for New York office landlords. By the end of 2020, the value of the city’s office buildings had fallen by 45%, an estimated $50 billion decline, according to a research paper published in 2022 by Columbia and New York University professors Arpit Gupta, Vrinda Mittal and Stijn van Nieuwerburgh. “In the future, this period of time will be called the great valuation reset,” says longtime New York real estate broker Bob Knakal. “People have to get tuned in with the reality of what the present market is.” Cohen, though, had locked in fixed-rate loans on several of his largest properties—including 750 Lexington Ave and the New York design center—in the years before the pandemic. In 2022, as the Federal Reserve began raising interest rates to battle high inflation, he chose to take advantage before rates got too high. In September that year he refinanced four properties and the two theater chains with a $534 million loan from Fortress. According to financial documents revealed in the Fortress lawsuit, Cohen’s empire was already feeling the pain by the 2022 refinancing. An independent auditor's report compiled in December 2022 stated that the firm was dealing with “net operating losses” and “high vacancy rates” which “raise substantial doubt about the company's ability to continue as a going concern.” The report also noted that the firm had pursued “significant efforts to increase occupancy and cost control measures” and also had “adequate cash resources and business continuity plans.” In the spring of 2023, Forbes investigated the collapse of commercial real estate values across major cities in the U.S. “You’ve got to be defensive,” Cohen told Forbes at the time, when asked about his strategy to survive the downturn. On his debt, he said: “It’s not an issue of imminent concern to me. We’re keeping lenders apprised of what’s going on, being transparent, explaining why things are the way they are.” Throughout the rest of that year, Cohen and Fortress extended the payment schedule on the loan and deferred payments, according to court filings. In November 2023, WeWork filed for bankruptcy and vacated more than 200,000 square feet at two Cohen properties in Los Angeles and New York—the latter bearing a mortgage owed to Fortress, and where WeWork had leased nearly a third of the total space. Tensions came to a head in February 2024, when Cohen and Fortress were negotiating a further extension. In emails revealed in court records, Cohen pushed back on Fortress' proposal but expressed hope that they would come to an agreement: “Over the last 20-plus years, we have always found a way forward together.” Dean Dakolias, Fortress' co-chairman and managing partner, fired back a blunt response. “Your last proposal was unrealistic and took us several steps backwards,” he wrote. “You’ve not made your last payment, and you’ve not demonstrated that you understand or prioritize the severity of your situation.” The next month, Fortress sued Cohen and demanded full repayment of the more than half billion loan, as well as a personal guaranty of up to $187 million—plus interest—from Cohen. Cohen counter-sued a month later, seeking to have the lawsuit dismissed and alleging that Fortress had reneged on an agreement to extend the loan. Fortress had demanded a foreclosure auction on Cohen’s properties in May, but a judge ruled in Cohen's favor in June and agreed to postpone it. In August, it was put on the schedule for November. In October, Cohen suffered another blow when the judge in the case ruled that Cohen had to pay the personal guaranty on the properties. (Cohen filed an appeal 11 days later, which is still pending.) Still, Cohen appeared to have more than enough resources to foot the bill: he had nearly $300 million in cash and investments as of June last year. According to Fortress, Cohen then attempted to shield his personal assets so they couldn’t be taken from him to cover the guaranty. The firm’s lawyers alleged that Cohen had transferred ownership of his 219-foot, $50 million yacht Seasense and three smaller vessels to offshore entities in the Cayman Islands, while shifting ownership of his $20 million home in Greenwich, Connecticut to his wife Clo, a former Jimmy Choo executive. Cohen hit back, stating that it was just routine estate planning, but Fortress won a court judgment in the Cayman Islands delaying the transfer. Cohen is also fighting the $187 million personal guaranty demanded by Fortress. In a filing ten days after the auction, Cohen's lawyers argued that the auction sales mean that the guaranty amount should be reduced by $75 million to account for the sale of the assets and the release of a lien on another Cohen property. In December, his lawyers also argued that Cohen had nearly $350 million in equity in four buildings—3 Park Avenue, 979 Third Avenue, 805 Third Avenue and 622 Third Avenue— sufficient to cover the remainder of what he owes to Fortress. Once again, Fortress disputed his claim, pointing to the fact that those values were based “on stale, year-old valuations” that have declined since then, and that all four properties are burdened with outstanding mortgages. The proceedings are still ongoing. Cohen's private theater at his Greenwich, Connecticut mansion cost $1 million to build and features a curved movie screen and a sculpture of a ticket collector handmade by a Massachusetts artisan. Outside of the Fortress dispute, Cohen is still saddled with several debt-laden buildings that are showing their age. And while he had less leverage on his buildings than other Manhattan real estate tycoons, he was particularly vulnerable to the effects of the pandemic due to his concentration in older office towers. “It's difficult for the owner of a Class B office building to make their buildings competitive with Class A product,” says Knakal, referring to older properties compared to newer construction like Hudson Yards or One Vanderbilt, which is fully occupied. “We're talking about declines in the order of 30% to 50% in value on average," adds Tomasz Piskorski, a professor of real estate at Columbia Business School. For real estate moguls with their wealth tied up in office towers, “it means they may no longer be billionaires.” In a bid to entice tenants, many owners of older properties are now offering as much as a year of free rent as well as pricey allowances for improvements. But Cohen sees that as a losing proposition. “We're only doing deals that make sense. A lot of our competition is just throwing money at deals,” he said in November. Cohen insists he’s working on improving his buildings to make them more competitive, arguing that they should be valued higher now due to recent transactions such as a November deal that valued S.L. Green’s One Vanderbilt at $4.7 billion and the December sales of two office towers on Park Avenue. “We're finishing up a major lobby renovation at 622 Third,” he said. “We're reinvesting in our buildings.” Those renovations are now complete, according to chief operating officer Cherniak, including a $13 million new lobby and exterior facade at 3 Park Avenue. Cohen’s also bullish on new lease activity to replace his vacancies. In Los Angeles, the space left by WeWork has been filled by the hospital and health science center Cedars-Sinai, an existing tenant. In New York, the firm expects to sign new leases at five of its least occupied towers in the coming months. Cohen may have a point: Office leasing activity in Manhattan increased 17% year-over-year in 2024, the highest since 2019, according to real estate brokerage Avison Young. Still, older or lower-quality properties made up just 23% of new leasing last year, and rents at those buildings are only about half what’s charged by trophy buildings—a sign that the resurgence in leasing is leaving many of these aging towers behind as tenants continue to opt for newer ones. Another strategy he has: converting office space to residential apartments and condos. In May, his firm filed for a special permit to convert 19 floors of its 38-story tower at 623 Fifth Avenue—across from the Rockefeller Center and atop Saks’ Fifth Avenue’s flagship store—to 172 condos. The project has since been scaled down to 60 to 70 condos, per Cherniak, but the firm is working on design plans. Another condo conversion project at 3 East 54th Street, which has views of Central Park, is further along, with the firm finishing the interior demolition last summer. “They’re all moving forward,” said Cohen. Yet the lender on the 54th Street property filed for foreclosure in December, putting that project in doubt. (Cohen says he is in the process of refinancing the loan.) Another proposed conversion at 135 East 57th Street is now dead in the water. The Wallace family, which owns the ground underneath that building, opposed the conversion project and sued Cohen over unpaid rent in December 2023. In October, a judge ruled in the family’s favor, handing the building over to them. According to New York office brokers who spoke with Forbes, if Cohen is able to follow through on the conversions, work with his lenders on the troubled properties and hold onto the buildings he wants while sacrificing others, he could survive the threats to his empire. As his appeal on the Fortress case works its way through the courts, Cohen is looking south toward his planned 23-story, 400,000-square-foot tower in West Palm Beach, named West Palm Point. Located close by two other office projects being developed by billionaires—Stephen Ross’ One Flagler and Jeff Greene’s One West Palm—the three edifices-in-progess form part of what has been called “Wall Street South,” as financial firms from BlackRock to Citadel open offices in the fast-growing city. Together they will add nearly 900,000 square feet of office space. Cohen’s building there, which is set to break ground in March, is expected to be finished in 2028. He plans to finance the construction with a mix of equity and loans. That could be a smart bet for Cohen, with Donald Trump’s election spurring business magnates and world leaders to flock to Palm Beach for its proximity to the new president’s Winter White House at Mar-a-Lago. According to Cherniak, the firm has already negotiated leases for six floors. “We have all our approvals. The contracting is just about complete and we're getting ready to close our loans and break ground,” Cohen said in November. “We've got leasing activity underway already." As for the legal battles, Cohen is going to keep fighting. “I'm not paying that personal guaranty. I've got defenses, I've got an appeal pending in the appellate division,” he said. “It's not over by a long shot."

Title: BlackRock, Weinstein Reach Truce in Spat on Closed-End Funds

(Bloomberg) -- BlackRock Inc. stuck agreements with Boaz Weinstein’s Saba Capital Management that will end the activist-hedge fund’s battle with BlackRock over dozens of closed-end funds whose share prices had tumbled deeply below the value of their underlying assets. As part of the deal, BlackRock agreed to repurchase a big chunk of the shares in two of its largest closed-end funds at a price close to their net asset values — 50% of outstanding shares in the $1.8 billion Innovation and Growth Term Trust (ticker BIGZ) and 40% of the $1.7 billion Health Sciences Term Trust (ticker BMEZ). Saba also entered so-called standstill agreements with 48 other BlackRock funds, according to regulatory filings. BIGZ and BMEZ, which had both had traded at deep discounts in the past, jumped more than 6% on the Tuesday proposals. The two tender offers, at a price of 99.5% of of their net asset values could potentially deliver more than $1.5 billion to shareholders, based on calculation by Bloomberg. Weinstein wrote in a post on X that the changes were made after “constructive discussions with BlackRock” and that “by committing to shareholder-friendly initiatives, liquidity events and governance enhancements, value can be unlocked for all investors.” Saba has spent years and billions of dollars buying up closed-end funds run by BlackRock and other big asset managers after their share prices dipped sharply below the value of the assets they hold, a trading anomaly that Saba said was harming investors. It mounted proxy fights and court battles in a bid to pressure the firms to take steps to erase that gap, including through tender offers to buy back the stock. Last year, Boaz ran proxy fights at 10 BlackRock funds with mixed outcomes. It also sued BlackRock’s ESG Capital Allocation Term Trust (ticker ECAT) over its voting bylaws, which is still subject to litigation in a federal court. Weinstein’s fights center around funds that buy income-producing assets, like junk bonds, municipal debt or dividend-paying stocks, that were hit hard when the Federal Reserve was raising interest rates and investors were looking to bail out. With their performances trailing market benchmarks, the discounted trading prices saddled investors with losses if they sold. The hedge fund manager is bringing a similar playbook to UK’s investment-trust industry and attempting to seize control of a bunch of those firms, including two trusts run by Janus Henderson Group Plc.

Title: ‘A Race of Sovereigns’ Will Serve As Next Catalyst for Higher Bitcoin Prices, Says Analyst Willy Woo

On-chain analyst Willy Woo thinks “a race of sovereigns” will catalyze higher Bitcoin (BTC) prices. In a new interview with Natalie Brunell, Woo says MicroStrategy kicked off the corporate BTC treasury trend in the previous cycle. He predicts the current cycle will see other sovereign wealth funds follow El Salvador and Bhutan’s lead. “I think this cycle, that starts to come out and the cycles ahead. And so everything becomes a race, and I don’t know if these are big unlocks, I think it’s one step after the next and the next and the next.” Woo says a big moment of the current cycle was when BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink expressed approval of BTC. “You’re not going to get fired for recommending Bitcoin. Asset managers [previously] would buy it themselves and not recommend it because it was risky for their career. Now I see CIOs at banks not only talking about Bitcoin as an investment but they’re talking about it as the next world reserve currency.” BTC is trading at $105,785 at time of writing after hitting a new all-time high of more than $108,000 on Monday. The top-ranked crypto asset by market cap is up more than 4% in the past 24 hours. Generated Image: Midjourney Covering the future of finance, including macro, bitcoin, ethereum, crypto, and web 3.

Title: Worries for Ireland as Trump moves on corporation tax

Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning Ireland’s corporation tax bonanza of recent years has been well documented, but now that Donald Trump is back in office, that particular gravy train may be about to come under threat. US president Donald Trump has moved to pull his country out of a landmark global corporate tax deal, setting up a potential stand-off between his administration and the European Union, with Ireland caught in the middle. Jack Power and Eoin Burke-Kennedy have the details, while Cliff Taylor breaks down just what is at stake in the row. Trump was inevitably the main topic of discussion at the second day of the World Economic Forum at Davos, with EU Commission president Ursula von der Leyen and German leader Olaf Schultz among those choosing their words carefully. Eoin is at the forum in the Swiss town, where he also assesses the view on where Trump’s tactics come from. Intel is still betting big on Ireland with the company’s €17 billion Leixlip plant seen as an “critical” to reversing the slide in the once-dominant chipmaker’s fortunes, according to sources close to the company. Eoin has the details. Kilkenny-based nutrition group Glanbia is planning a restructuring of the administrative functions at its Irish locations in a move that will involve up to 60 redundancies, some of them compulsory. As Ciaran Hancock reports, staff have been informed that a new centralised unit is being established – Glanbia Enterprise Solutions – for the delivery of finance, HR and IT services to the business. Some of this work will be outsourced to third-party providers. The economy is currently experiencing a “moderation” in growth, according to Ibec, which is forecasting a slowdown in employment growth in the coming years. As Colin Gleeson reports, the business lobby group’s latest economic outlook is forecasting gross domestic product growth of 1.7 per cent this year and 2.1 per cent in 2026. It says the moderation is “not unexpected”, particularly given the turbulence faced by some of Ireland’s largest trading partners. With the next government set to be formally take power today, John McManus looks at what we can expect from the new(ish) team, and what deals may have been agreed to get a working majority into place. How hard is it to save, really? In Money Matters, Joanne Hunt looks at how a little bit of planning, and consistently setting aside just a few euros per month, can add up quickly. BNY Mellon has announced the closure of its facility in Wexford with about 300 jobs impacted. The global financial firm employs about 310 employees at its offices in the Drinagh Business Park on the outskirts of the town. There had been widespread reports over recent days that jobs at the firm were in jeopardy. Brendan Furlong has the story. Online payments firm Stripe is to make 300 staff redundant over the coming months, including a small number in Ireland, as part of what is understood to be a review of some aspects of its operations. A consultation process has been initiated with the people whose roles are expected to be impacted and this is expected to be complete within a matter of weeks. Emmet Malone reports. The Blackrock Clinic is to create 50 jobs by establishing a women’s health centre over four floors in a new Dublin city centre location “in a pivotal step forward in enhancing women’s health services”, the company said. Gordon Deegan has the story. Munich Re, the world’s largest reinsurance group, is seeking to cut as many as 18 jobs – or almost 12 per cent of roles – within its Irish software technology unit, Munich Re Automation Solutions, as part of a restructuring of the business. In Commercial Property, Fiona Reddan reports that The Morrison Hotel, on Dublin’s north quays, has been put up for sale, with the sellers seeking between €90 million and €95 million. If it achieves this price level then owner Zetland Capital/Centauro Holdings, a UK private equity investor, would stand to secure a significant return on its original €65 million investment.

Title: Paralyzed man flies virtual drone by thought alone
URL: https://www.digitaltrends.com/news/paralyzed-man-flies-virtual-drone-by-thought-alone/
Time Published: 2025-01-22T06:25:29Z
Full Content:
A man with paralysis has been able to fly a virtual drone using only his thoughts. The feat was made possible by a brain-computer interface (BCI) that decoded the man’s brain activity in real time, Nature reported this week. The neural signals were associated with finger movements that enabled control of the virtual drone. “There’s a lot of things that we enjoy or do as humans where we use multiple individuated finger movements, so like typing, sewing, playing a musical instrument,” said Matthew Willsey, the study’s co-author and a neurosurgeon at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. “That’s what this line of work is focused on — how we enable the control of multiple things at the same time.” Willsey added that the experiment could’ve been performed with a real drone but the team decided to use a virtual one for ease and safety. The 69-year-old man who participated in the study told the researchers that controlling the virtual object felt like playing a musical instrument, saying: “Flying [the virtual drone] is tiny little finesses off a middle line, a little bit up, a little bit down.” The man’s BCI was fitted by Blackrock Neurotech and was implanted in the area of the brain that controls hand motion. An AI model was used to map the neural signals received by the BCI’s electrodes to the man’s thoughts, New Scientist explained. The participant first went through a process of learning how to imagine some of his fingers moving in a way that created electrical signals of varying strength, which later allowed him to pilot the virtual drone through an obstacle course. Willsey said that for the participant, the test was the realization of “a dream that he thought was lost once he suffered his injury. He had a passion and a dream for flying. He seemed very empowered and enabled — he would have us take videos and send it to friends.” BCI technology has made significant advancements in recent years, with companies like Elon Musk’s Neuralink also developing a device that is currently undergoing human testing. Once fully developed, a slew of exciting applications could bring significant freedom and independence to those with paralysis. They include allowing people with severe paralysis or locked-in syndrome to communicate by translating neural activity into text or speech simply through their thoughts. It can also enable people to use computers, play games, and operate wheelchairs and robotic prosthetics, and even do things like grasp objects or scratch their face. However, challenges remain with the technology, including medical risks from the surgery required to implant a BCI device. High levels of concentration are also required from the person using the device, with current BCIs correctly recognizing mental commands only about 80% of the time, and up to 30% of users failing to get it to function at all. The health and psychological implications of the technology, including cognitive fatigue and long-term exposure to electromagnetic fields, are also not yet fully understood. These and other challenges highlight the need for continued research and development to improve BCI technology, deal with safety concerns, and create appropriate regulatory frameworks. Soccer giant Manchester City this week secured the English Premier League title, beating archrival Manchester United into second place. As part of the celebrations, the club has offered its fans -- as well as anyone with an interest in drone photography -- a stunning fly-through of its modern, 55,000-seat Etihad Stadium. The groundwork is being laid for the quantum internet -- up in the air. Recently, researchers from Nanjing University in China demonstrated that it is possible to send entangled photons between a pair of drones, called Alice and Bob, hovering one kilometer apart. Have Robot Arms, Will Eat Twinkie Robert "Buz" Chmielewski, a quadriplegic man who suffered an accident in his teens that left him with minimal movement and feeling in his hands, recently fed himself dessert with the aid of two prosthetic robot arms he was able to control using his mind.

USYC, or the Hashnote Short Duration Yield Coin, is backed by U.S. Treasury debt and reverse repurchase agreements, with a total asset value of over $1.25 billion, according to RWA data. It comes as multiple businesses seek to tap into an anticipated lucrative boom for real-world asset tokenization. The move is also expected to bolster Circle’s standing against rival and stablecoin giant Tether, which launched its tokenization platform, Hadron, in November. Supporting the integration, Circle has partnered with DRW subsidiary Cumberland, a major institutional crypto trading firm, which will underpin the integration between the fund and Circle’s stablecoin, USDC. Cumberland will expand liquidity and settlement capabilities for USDC and USYC in a bid to drive broader adoption in both crypto and traditional capital markets, according to a statement on Tuesday. The integration is expected to place USYC as a preferred yield-bearing collateral for exchanges, custodians, and prime brokers in both crypto and traditional finance markets, Circle said. Speaking on the partnership, Circle’s CEO Jeremy Allaire said Tuesday on X there exists an “enormous opportunity” to “bring yield-bearing collateral to crypto market structures” around the clock. “One of the Holy Grails of capital markets is the ability to move between cash and collateral instantly,” he said. “We are unlocking this with a focus on the well-established crypto capital markets.” TMMFs are blockchain-based digital versions of traditional financial assets, such as Treasury bills, offering faster ways to invest in yield-generating instruments. Plans to deploy native USDC on Canton, a blockchain tailored for secure and private financial applications, were also announced. Canton processes over $3.6 trillion in tokenized RWAs and facilitates more than $1.5 trillion in monthly repo transactions, the companies said. The tokenization of real-world assets, which converts ownership rights of physical assets into blockchain-based tokens, is gaining traction. The total value locked in the sector has risen 36.9% in a year to $7.89 billion, as per DeFiLlama data. That’s expected to balloon to more than $50 billion by some estimates. Spying an early opportunity, the world’s asset manager, BlackRock, launched a fund of its own on Ethereum in March of last year, allowing qualified investors to earn U.S. dollar yields. Dubbed the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), the vehicle reportedly contains more than $500 million in assets under management. “Circle is leading the way in bringing the most important building blocks of money onchain, fostering a more scalable model of global institutional adoption of crypto infrastructure, while also paving the way for onchain money to become the core of traditional financial markets,” Allaire said in his post.

Title: Bitcoin mining revenue hits $45M – Understanding what it means for you
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/bitcoin-mining-revenue-hits-45m-understanding-what-it-means-for-you/
Time Published: 2025-01-22T06:00:22Z
Full Content:
Bitcoin mining saw a surge in revenue, highlighting potential for sustained growth or a new bull cycle. Bitcoin [BTC] mining has long been a key indicator of market health. Recent spikes in mining revenue and network activity seemed to suggest that the Bitcoin network could be entering a new phase. With daily mining revenue reaching approximately $45 million, current conditions closely mirror the high network activity seen during Bitcoin’s previous bull cycles. However, the big question remains – Does this surge in mining revenue signal the start of another explosive bull run, or is it an indication of sustained growth that is less tied to immediate price fluctuations? The recent surge in Bitcoin mining revenue, reaching approximately $45 million daily, highlights a significant boost in network activity. This hike signals not only a healthy ecosystem, but also heightened miner confidence. As miners continue to secure the Bitcoin network, metrics like hash rate and block difficulty provide valuable insights into its overall strength. A rising hash rate means greater participation and computing power, while climbing block difficulty hints at a more challenging environment for miners. Together, these indicators point to a thriving Bitcoin network that could be gearing up for a new phase of growth. Bitcoin’s historical data revealed a clear correlation between mining revenue spikes and the onset of bull markets. In late 2017 and early 2021, mining revenues soared alongside high network activity and transaction fees, signaling investor enthusiasm and price rallies to all-time highs. For instance, in late 2017, mining revenue surged past $50 million daily, coinciding with Bitcoin’s climb to $20,000. Similarly, early 2021 saw revenues spike to over $60 million as Bitcoin reached $60,000. These surges reflected strong network fundamentals, such as rising hash rates and transaction volumes, which typically precede price booms. Source: Cryptoquant The daily mining revenue of $45 million seemed to align closely with these historical thresholds, suggesting a potential bullish signal. However, the impact of this figure can extend beyond immediate price speculation. It underlined strong network activity, miner confidence, and growing adoption, hinting that Bitcoin’s ecosystem is solidifying. If historical patterns hold, the current mining revenue could foreshadow a significant price rally or signal sustained, steady growth driven by a thriving, secure network. Either scenario would reaffirm Bitcoin’s position as a resilient, maturing asset class. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $104,551 with a steady upward trend in recent sessions. The RSI at indicated bullish momentum but not yet overbought territory, suggesting room for further upward movement. On-balance volume at -89.25K reflected growing accumulation, supporting the price action. Source: TradingView Historical resistance levels near $110,000 could act as a critical test for continued momentum. If breached, it may signal the onset of a broader bull run. However, sustained volume and a push beyond the RSI threshold of 70 are needed to confirm a strong trend. The press time data supported optimism, but necessitated careful monitoring for confirmation of a sustained breakout. Read Bitcoin’s [BTC] Price Prediction 2025–2026 Bitcoin mining appears to be entering a phase of sustained growth, independent of traditional market cycles. Increasing institutional adoption by major players like BlackRock and Fidelity is stabilizing the market, while global demand for Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and an alternative financial system continues to grow. Technological advancements in mining hardware, such as energy-efficient ASICs, are further enhancing profitability, ensuring miners stay competitive even as block rewards decrease. Long-term trends point to a transformation in mining economics. As block rewards halve every four years, transaction fees are expected to become the primary revenue source, driving miners to adopt renewable energy and cost-efficient practices. By aligning with sustainability and technological innovation, Bitcoin mining may well-positioned for continued growth and relevance in the evolving digital economy.

Title: Commission of investigation into abuse in schools ‘a priority’ for new government

A commission of investigation into abuse in schools, including private fee-paying schools, will be “a priority” for the new government, Minister for Education Norma Foley has said. In a letter to survivors this week, she assured them “that there has been no let-up in the work being carried out by the high-level group that I set up to progress the establishment of the commission of investigation” into abuses in the schools. Noting that she herself was “part of the negotiating team during the talks on the formation of a new government”, she was “pleased to say that the programme for government contains a specific provision in relation to the next steps following the report of the scoping inquiry”. [ Further 12 Spiritan abuse survivors come forward since September’s scoping inquiryOpens in new window ] This, she said, stated that: “Cognisant of the experience of survivors of historical abuse and in line with their wishes as per the scoping inquiry of Mary O’Toole SC, we will as a priority establish and support the work of a commission of investigation as agreed by Cabinet in September 2024.” Last September, the Government formally agreed to establish a statutory inquiry into the sexual abuse of children at day and boarding schools, following recommendations in the 700-page scoping inquiry report, led by Ms O’Toole. The inquiry was set up following revelations of widespread sexual abuse of boys at Willow Park and Blackrock College in south Co Dublin. It followed the broadcast of RTÉ radio documentary Blackrock Boys in November 2022 and the launch that month also of a restorative justice programme involving abuse survivors and the Spiritan congregation, which runs the schools. [ Abuse report: Full list of 308 schools and case numbers detailedOpens in new window ] Last September’s scoping inquiry report disclosed 2,395 allegations of sexual abuse at 308 schools run by religious congregations, involving 884 alleged abusers. A high number of allegations were concentrated in special education schools, where 590 allegations were recorded in 17 institutions involving 190 alleged abusers. In her letter this week, Ms Foley said the high-level group to which she referred had also been asked to consider other recommendations of the scoping inquiry report, related to “redress, child protection and memorialisation”. “I am conscious that you and other survivors want to see early action, and so the group was asked to report as quickly as possible. I can confirm that its work has been progressing well and it expects to report shortly,” she said. [ Statutory inquiry into sexual abuse of children at day and boarding schools agreed at CabinetOpens in new window ] She hoped her letter would assure survivors “of the ongoing commitment of government in responding to the appalling historical sexual abuse experienced by survivors which was set out in the devastating accounts contained in the report of the scoping inquiry”. Expressing her “personal gratitude” to survivors “for engaging in the process”, she said she was “conscious that your courage has inspired, and will inspire, many others to step forward and share their experiences. I will also be forever grateful for the open, honest and honourable manner in which so many of you engaged with me on a personal basis. Thank you.” Patsy McGarry is a contributor to The Irish Times © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Wachtell Lipton Discusses Court Ruling that BlackRock’s Inclusion as Investment Manager Breaches ERISA Duty of Loyalty
URL: https://clsbluesky.law.columbia.edu/2025/01/22/wachtell-lipton-discusses-court-ruling-that-blackrocks-inclusion-as-investment-manager-breaches-erisa-duty-of-loyalty/
Time Published: 2025-01-22T05:01:03Z
Full Content:
The District Court for the Northern District of Texas recently ruled that a company breached its fiduciary duties under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”) for permitting BlackRock’s inclusion as an investment manager of its employees’ retirement assets in a 401(k) Plan. After a four-day bench trial, the Court found that the company failed to “loyally act solely in the retirement plan’s best financial interests by allowing their corporate interests, as well as BlackRock’s ESG interests, to influence management of the plan.” Core to the Court’s holding is its evidentiary determination that BlackRock “pursues a pervasive ESG agenda” that “covertly converts the retirement plan’s core index portfolios to ESG funds,” and that this harms the financial interests of 401(k) participants. As we have noted in prior memos, including The Future of ESG: Thoughts for Boards and Management in 2024, the politicization of ESG has led to “anti-ESG” legislation in several states and a general corporate and investor retreat from use of the term. BlackRock itself has publicly disavowed the term and recently began expanding voting choice programs to include voting policies that oppose energy transition and decarbonization efforts to appeal to a wider swath of its client base and allay the concerns of regulators. The Court ruling notes these recent moves, including BlackRock’s 2024 announcement that it was leaving Climate Action 100+, citing these distancing efforts as “telling” evidence of BlackRock’s “apparent recognition” that ESG investing was problematic under ERISA. The Court found that the company “turned a blind eye to BlackRock’s ESG activism,” and did not sufficiently “monitor, evaluate, and address” the extent to which BlackRock was pursuing a “non-pecuniary ESG investment strategy.” The ruling described BlackRock’s influence over the company—as one of the company’s largest shareholders and a significant debt holder—as the explanation for the company’s “lack of accountability with respect to BlackRock.” This ruling adds an additional layer of consideration for companies and boards seeking to navigate the evolving regulatory and legal landscape on ESG matters. It remains an appropriate and essential part of business judgment for companies to evaluate how key business risks—including those related to the environment, employees, and communities in which companies operate—may impact long-term performance. A number of companies are carefully crafting how they message their policies and thoughtfully considering the specific language they are using. Companies need to continue to be mindful of the current environment as they chart their path forward. This post comes to us from Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz. It is based on the firm’s memorandum, “District Court Rules BlackRock’s Inclusion as 401(k) Investment Manager Breaches Company’s ERISA Duty of Loyalty,” dated January 13, 2025.

Title: The end of ESG and ‘sustainability’ nonsense?
URL: https://www.wnd.com/2025/01/the-end-of-esg-and-sustainability-nonsense/
Time Published: 2025-01-22T01:56:00Z
Full Content:
By John Stossel January 21, 2025 “Sustainability” investments became popular a few years back. So-called experts said companies shouldn’t just focus on profit. They should put more effort into being “nice.” Funds pushing ESG (environmental, social and governance) were all the rage. Giant investment firms like BlackRock pressured companies to hire more women and minorities. CEO Larry Fink announced, “All investments are going to be looked through sustainability.” Get the hottest, most important news stories on the Internet – delivered FREE to your inbox as soon as they break! Take just 30 seconds and sign up for WND's Email News Alerts! But “sustainability” is a mostly meaningless word. Parnassus claimed it helped meet U.N. sustainability goals of “nutrition” and “sanitation” by investing in U.S. Foods and Clorox. Starbucks phased out plastic straws while adding lids that used more plastic. BP rebranded itself as “Beyond Petroleum.” Wisely, it mostly invested in petroleum. Former Vice President Al Gore made money peddling climate change hysteria. He created “sustainability investment funds,” claiming “sustainability factors … actually enhance returns!” His funds did enhance Gore’s own returns; he made millions. But over the past three years, his “sustainable” fund underperformed the stock market. Recently, the fund managers admitted they “made investment mistakes.” Most funds promoting “sustainable investment” did worse than the market. So, why did trillions of dollars pour into such funds? “Because of pressures,” says Matt Cole, CEO of Strive Investments, in my new video. “Their largest clients are blue states’ pension (funds) like CalPERS and the New York pension (fund) who put pressure on them: ‘Adopt these agendas or you’re going to lose us as your largest customer!'” CalPERS still brags about “mitigating climate risk” and adding “climate-conscious board members” to Exxon’s board. Presidential Climate Envoy John Kerry pompously bullied banks: “They will invest into climate-related efforts,” he intoned. Today, banks and even Blackrock are running from sustainability nonsense. “What you’re seeing,” says Cole, “is ESG funds shuttering at record speed … and they’re not apologizing.” Progressives never do. This fad didn’t just hurt investors; it hurt companies that America needs. America needs high-performance computer chips. Intel was once the leading manufacturer of such chips. But now, even as Congress gives Intel billions in taxpayer handouts, the company is cutting thousands of jobs. Why? While Intel’s competitors innovated, Intel obsessed about “sustainability.” Intel’s website lists endless ESG goals like “environmental, health, wellness, and safety programs to care for people and the planet.” It even brags about “green software” … whatever that is. That’s a lot of energy spent not making the best chip. When companies spend time sucking up to politicians rather than innovating, they often decline. Intel’s stock fell 60% last year. Fortunately, today more companies are focusing on basic capitalism – producing better products for less money. Ford recently announced it will no longer require employees to take LGBTQ advocacy group surveys. USA Today reports that Lowe’s will reduce its participation with the Human Rights Campaign to “narrow its focus to safe and affordable housing.” When I was co-host of “20/20,” I wondered what would happen when Disney bought ABC. Not much changed for a while. But a few years later, after repeatedly rejecting videos I proposed about problems with Obamacare, ABC fired me. Still later, I laughed as I watched Disney go full woke. The president of the entertainment content division said, “We have many, many, many LGBTQIA characters in our stories, and yet we don’t have enough leads.” Disney’s television animation producer added, “I was just, wherever I could, adding queerness.” But many such movies flopped. “The Marvels,” featuring a Muslim teen and black female sidekick, lost $237 million. “Lightyear,” featuring the first same-sex kiss in a Disney-Pixar movie, lost $106 million. “Elemental,” featuring a nonbinary character (a lake with earrings), didn’t even reach $30 million it’s opening week. Now Disney’s quietly scaling back. More companies have started to recognize a need to focus on their core business rather than virtue-signaling. “It’s the beginnings of an unwind,” says Cole, “that I think is going to be critical for us to achieve success.” I wonder why they were so dumb in the first place.
