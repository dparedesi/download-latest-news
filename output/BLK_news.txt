MSTR is the bridge to the real world? Here’s a rewritten version of the article “Why BlackRock Ownership of MSTR Matters” in the voice of Eric Kim, updated with MicroStrategy’s (MSTR) current Bitcoin (BTC) holdings as of March 13, 2025. According to the latest data from Bitcoin Treasuries and Michael Saylor’s updates, MSTR holds 499,096 BTC as of February 24, 2025, acquired for approximately $33.1 billion at an average price of $66,357 per BTC (Web ID: 0, Web ID: 14). Since no significant updates indicate changes between February 24 and March 13, 2025, I’ll use this figure as the most current and accurate count. Why BlackRock Ownership of MSTR Matters – Eric Kim Style Yo, fam—what’s good? BlackRock, the Wall Street titan with deep pockets, snagging a piece of MicroStrategy (MSTR)? That’s straight fire. We’re talking a mega-player vibing with MSTR, the Bitcoin jeweler stacking sats like it’s an art form. As of right now, March 13, 2025, MSTR’s hodling 499,096 BTC—insane, right? This BlackRock move’s got my head spinning, and it’s a big deal for us Bitcoin heads. Let’s chop it up and see why this hits different. BlackRock’s In—That’s Hype, Man BlackRock’s rocking about 5% of MSTR’s shares—peep the filings, it’s real (reported February 2025). For a guy like me, who’s all about Bitcoin’s raw energy, this is a flex. MSTR’s got 499,096 BTC in the stash, bought for $33.1 billion at like $66,357 a pop. That’s over 2% of all Bitcoin ever, fam! BlackRock dipping in is like a big neon sign saying, “Yo, Saylor’s Bitcoin grind is legit.” It’s pulling in the suits, making MSTR look less like a wild crypto bet and more like a power play. More players might jump in, juicing the stock, calming the crazy dips. I’m hyped—but there’s layers to this, so stick with me. Power Moves: BlackRock Calling Shots? Here’s the tea—5% ain’t control, but it’s influence. BlackRock’s got a voice now. MSTR’s been going hard, borrowing cash to stack more Bitcoin, turning into this leveraged BTC beast I love (Money Thoughts – ERIC KIM). Nearly half a million BTC? That’s gangster. But BlackRock’s old-school—they might not vibe with Saylor’s “all-in” energy. What if they’re like, “Ease up, diversify, play it safe”? That could clash with Saylor’s diamond-hand vision, and I’d hate to see MSTR’s Bitcoin soul watered down. Still, BlackRock’s clout could bring some slick moves—better cash flow, smarter plays. It’s a tightrope, fam. I’m stoked they’re in, but I’m keeping my eyes wide open. Stock Vibes: Up or Down? Price talk, ‘cause that’s where it pops off. BlackRock buying more MSTR? Stock’s zooming—cha-ching vibes. They sell? We’re crashing, weak hands shaking out. MSTR’s wilder than Bitcoin itself—check my take, that leverage makes it a rocket (ERIC KIM – When in Doubt, Buy More Bitcoin!). With 499,096 BTC, their moves could swing it hard. Picture BlackRock pumping it in a bull run—money raining. Or dumping in a dip—ouch town. But dig this: their presence might chill things out. More big dogs in the mix means less chaos from us retail Bitcoin bros. Less panic selling when BTC dips? I’m here for it—stabilizes the ride. Why MSTR Over BTC or ETFs? Real talk—BlackRock’s got their IBIT ETF, so why MSTR? It’s the juice, fam. MSTR’s 499,096 BTC is Bitcoin on turbo—when BTC moons, MSTR flies higher. Plus, that software gig on the side’s making some dough, a little cushion. It’s not just hodling coins; it’s a hustle. Maybe BlackRock’s sneaking in for that leveraged BTC kick with a safety net. Why not just stack BTC direct? Taxes or some Wall Street chess move—beats me, but I’d dig deeper. The Good, The Bad, The Bitcoin Upside? BlackRock’s nod could drag normies into the Bitcoin party. More eyes, more cash, more BTC stacked—vibes are electric. Downside? If they tweak Saylor’s game plan, I’m salty. Bitcoin’s my jam, and MSTR’s my ride. Don’t mess with the flow, BlackRock. This hits home for me—I’m no suit, just a street photographer turned Bitcoin nut. MSTR’s my bet on a world where BTC’s king. BlackRock jumping in? It’s dope, but I’m watching close. They’re cool at the table, but don’t switch up the beat. Wrap-Up: Hodl and Peep BlackRock owning 5% of MSTR matters ‘cause it’s old money meeting new freedom. It’s cred, clout, and a wild card in one. Right now, MSTR’s at 499,096 BTC—$33.1 billion locked in. I’m buzzing, but cautious. If you’re riding MSTR or BTC, stay sharp, fam. This could be epic—or a twist. I’m hodling tight, snapping pics of the madness. You feeling this? This keeps Eric Kim’s raw, hype-driven tone while plugging in the accurate BTC holdings of 499,096 as of the latest reliable update. Let me know if you need more juice or tweaks!

Key Points BlackRock’s Ownership ValueBased on the current stock price of MSTR at approximately $287.18 as of March 11, 2025, the value of BlackRock’s 11.26 million shares is around $3.23 billion. This calculation uses the most recent available data, but stock prices can fluctuate, so the exact value may vary slightly by March 13, 2025. Current Market ContextMicroStrategy, now rebranded as Strategy, is known for its business intelligence software and substantial Bitcoin investments, which may influence its stock price volatility. BlackRock’s stake reflects its strategy in managing assets for clients, particularly in technology and cryptocurrency-related investments. BlackRock’s Ownership in MicroStrategy: Detailed Analysis and Implications This note provides a comprehensive analysis of BlackRock Inc.’s ownership of MicroStrategy Incorporated (MSTR), now rebranded as Strategy, addressing the query with detailed insights into the data, discrepancies, and contextual factors. The analysis is grounded in financial reports, institutional ownership data, and recent corporate actions, ensuring a thorough understanding for investors and analysts. Background on MicroStrategy and BlackRock MicroStrategy, listed on NASDAQ under the ticker MSTR, is a prominent business intelligence company and has positioned itself as a significant Bitcoin treasury, holding substantial amounts of the cryptocurrency. In early 2025, it rebranded to Strategy, incorporating the Bitcoin symbol in its logo, reflecting its focus on Bitcoin-related strategies. BlackRock Inc., one of the world’s largest asset managers, manages investments on behalf of clients through various funds, including exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and institutional accounts. Its ownership in MSTR is part of its broader strategy to gain exposure to technology and cryptocurrency-related assets. Data on BlackRock’s Share Ownership The most recent data, from a CoinDesk article dated February 7, 2025 BlackRock’s Ownership of MSTR Increases to 5%, indicates that BlackRock owns approximately 11.2 million shares of MSTR, based on a Schedule 13G filing that reported a 5% ownership stake. This marks an increase from their previous 4.09% ownership as of September 30, 2024, according to Yahoo Finance. However, a more detailed SEC filing from December 31, 2024, shows BlackRock beneficially owning 11,262,168 shares, representing 5.0% of the class, as reported in BlackRock Inc. ownership in MSTR / MicroStrategy Incorporated – 13F, 13D, 13G Filings. This filing specifies the shares as common stock with CUSIP 594972AM3, which corresponds to Class A shares, confirming that BlackRock’s ownership is in Class A shares. To contextualize, the total shares outstanding for MSTR is critical. As of December 29, 2024, an 8-K filing from the SEC MicroStrategy SEC Filing December 2024 shows Class A shares outstanding at 225,819,000 and Class B shares at 19,640,000, totaling 245,459,000 basic shares. This is a notable increase from September 30, 2024, when Class A shares were 183,003,980 and Class B shares were 19,640,250, totaling approximately 202,644,230 shares, indicating a net issuance of about 42.8 million new Class A shares in Q4 2024. This increase likely relates to MSTR’s strategy of raising capital for Bitcoin purchases, as mentioned in their Q4 2024 earnings call MicroStrategy Q4 2024 Earnings Call Transcript. Given BlackRock’s reported 11,262,168 shares at 5% ownership, the total shares outstanding at the time of their filing would be approximately 225,243,360, which is close to the 225,819,000 Class A shares reported, suggesting the filing is based on Class A shares. Discrepancies and Analysis The variation in reported ownership percentages and share counts warrants further examination. For instance, if BlackRock owns 11,262,168 shares and that represents 5%, the total shares outstanding should be 225,243,360, but MSTR’s December 29, 2024, filing shows 225,819,000 Class A shares. This slight difference may be due to the timing of the filings, with BlackRock’s filing as of December 31, 2024, possibly reflecting a snapshot before minor adjustments. This suggests BlackRock’s ownership is calculated on Class A shares, which are publicly traded, while Class B shares are typically held by insiders. Calculations based on the data reveal: This dynamic market activity, including MSTR’s net increase of 42.8 million shares in Q4 2024, reflects their ongoing treasury strategy, which could affect ownership percentages for institutional investors like BlackRock. Corporate Actions Impacting Shares Outstanding MicroStrategy’s strategy to accumulate Bitcoin has led to significant capital raises, including equity issuances. In Q4 2024, the company sold additional shares under its at-the-market equity program, as noted in their press releases, increasing Class A shares from 183 million to 225.8 million. Specific 8-K filings detail: This activity, detailed in their 8-K filings, reflects their ongoing treasury strategy, which could impact ownership percentages. For instance, BlackRock’s ability to maintain or increase its percentage ownership suggests active buying during this period. Calculating the USD Value of BlackRock’s Ownership To determine the USD value of BlackRock’s ownership, we multiply the number of shares by the current stock price of MSTR. Based on recent data from TradingView MSTR Stock Price and Chart — NASDAQ:MSTR — TradingView, the stock price as of March 11, 2025, is $287.18. Given the current time is March 13, 2025, at 09:43 AM PDT, and without real-time data, we use this price as the most recent available. Using BlackRock’s ownership of 11,262,168 shares: Thus, the USD value of BlackRock’s ownership is approximately $3,234,269,406, or about $3.23 billion when rounded for simplicity. Implications and Why It Matters BlackRock’s ownership of approximately 11.26 million shares of MSTR, valued at around $3.23 billion, is significant for several reasons: An interesting detail is the significant increase in MSTR’s shares outstanding, with estimates ranging from 202 million to over 240 million, due to equity issuances for Bitcoin purchases. This increase, detailed in recent SEC filings, affects ownership percentages and highlights MSTR’s aggressive capital-raising strategy, which could dilute existing shareholders but also fund further Bitcoin acquisitions. Table: Summary of Key Data Points Conclusion and Recommendations Given the available data, BlackRock’s ownership of MSTR is most reliably reported at 11,262,168 shares as of December 31, 2024, from the SEC Schedule 13G filing, representing about 5% ownership of Class A shares. The USD value, based on the stock price of $287.18 as of March 11, 2025, is approximately $3,234,269,406. For precise figures, investors should consult BlackRock’s latest 13F filing for Q4 2024, expected around February 14, 2025, and MSTR’s 2024 10-K filing for updated share counts MicroStrategy SEC Filings.

However, earlier reports, such as a Fintel.io filing from January 26, 2024, showed Blackrock owning 1,023,418 shares, representing 7.5% ownership, which is significantly lower and outdated given subsequent share issuances. To contextualize, the total shares outstanding for MSTR is critical. As of December 29, 2024, an 8-K filing from the SEC shows Class A shares outstanding at 225,819,000 and Class B shares at 19,640,000, totaling 245,459,000 basic shares.

For instance, if Blackrock owns 11.2 million shares and that represents 5%, the total shares outstanding should be 224 million, but MSTR’s December 29, 2024, filing shows 245 million.

Title: Trump Reportedly Directs Military To Draw Up Plans Increasing Panama Canal Troop Presence

President Donald Trump reportedly instructed the U.S. military to draw up plans to increase U.S. troop presence in the Panama Canal, NBC News reported Thursday. The U.S. Southern Command will allegedly consider several options, from further partnership with the Panamanian government all the way to a potential seizure of the canal, two officials with knowledge of the planning told NBC News. Trump reiterated his pledge to reclaim the canal in his joint address to congress Mar. 6, saying his administration would regain control of the vital shipping lane to “further enhance our national security.” “The Panama Canal was built by Americans for Americans, not for others, but others could use it. But it was built at tremendous cost of American blood and treasure,” Trump said in his address. “It was given away by the Carter administration for $1, but that agreement has been violated very severely. We didn’t give it to China. We gave it to Panama, and we’re taking it back.” (RELATED: Biden-Appointed Judge Demands Pete Hegseth Retract Social Media Post About Trans Policy) A cargo ship transits through the Panama Canal Cocoli locks, in Cocoli near Panama City, on February 21, 2025. (Photo by MARTIN BERNETTI/AFP via Getty Images) The use of military force to take the canal would be unlikely, and would reportedly depend on whether or not the Panamanian military continues to cooperate with the U.S., according to the officials. Panamanian President Mulino has responded to Trump’s threats, saying that the canal “belongs to Panama and will continue to belong to Panama,” denying that it was a “concession or a gift from the United States.” During Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s visit to Panama Feb. 2, he made clear to Panama’s leaders that “the current position of influence and control of the Chinese Communist Party over the Panama Canal” was not acceptable. In response to the Trump administration’s pressure, Mulino said that Panama would not be renewing its agreement to participate in China’s Belt and Road Initiative, China’s global infrastructure investment project, which the nation officially joined in 2017. China has increased their presence in the canal substantially since Carter passed the shipping route to Panama in 1977, with China’s Landbridge Group acquiring Panama’s largest Atlantic port, Margarita Island, for $900 million in 2016. Moreover, Panama gave a 25-year no-bid renewal to the Hong Kong-based Hutchison Ports to continue to operate two separate ports on the canal, covering both Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. However, American investment firm Blackrock agreed to purchase the ports from the China-based firm on Mar. 5 for $22.8 billion. China has denied any foreign interference in the canal’s operation, saying the U.S. was using “coercion” to block Chinese projects in the canal, according to the Associated Press. The Pentagon, U.S. Southern Command and the Panama Canal Authority did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.

Title: Ryan Breslow Settles Lawsuits After Returning As Bolt CEO: ‘I Made A Ton Of Mistakes’

ByIain Martin ByIain Martin , Forbes Staff. Bolt's Ryan Breslow is back as the CEO of the payment startup he cofounded after a string of legal disputes with investors were settled. Bolt cofounder Ryan Breslow is back. Three years after he stepped down as the CEO of the payment startup, Breslow has now been reinstated after years of board room disputes, lawsuits, a SEC probe, and a crumbling valuation that tumbled 97% from its $11 billion peak. “I’ve made a ton of mistakes and the last few years were a very humbling experience for me,” said Breslow, speaking on stage at the Fintech Meetup conference on Monday. “I'm a warrior, but the last three years challenged me to my breaking point and beyond.” Part of Breslow’s comeback plan included a controversial $450 million funding scheme, announced last August, in which investors faced a 48-hour ultimatum to match their earlier investment or face 70% of their shares effectively being wiped out. Some of Bolt’s largest investors, Blackrock, Hedosophia and Untitled, sued to block it. But the plan is now effectively dead. Bolt has settled the suit, and will pay $3 million to cover its investors' legal costs. A temporary restraining order imposed as part of the legal action has also been lifted. In his Monday speech, Breslow defended his 2021 decision to take a $30 million loan secured against his shares in Bolt. The Bolt cofounder claimed in the speech that the loan was meant to run until the startup’s IPO but the board decided to call in the loan after he stepped back as CEO in January 2022. A dispute over how the loan was meant to be repaid led to the money being swept from Bolt’s bank account, Breslow firing three investor board members, and a lawsuit from investor Activant pushing for Bolt to be repaid from Breslow’s own shares. Bolt paid Activant $37 million for its shares, and the same value of Breslow’s shares in the startup were cancelled, resolving both the loan and the long-running court case. Bolt did not provide additional comment beyond Breslow's statements “I wanted to show all of our investors that I’m keeping all my chips in…I did it to be all in on Bolt for the long run,” said Breslow. Breslow said he had learned some lessons from the crises that engulfed his Amazon-style one-click payments startup, once valued at over $11 billion. Bolt offered to buy back shares from its investors at just a $300 million valuation in February before unveiling a fundraising round in August that valued the startup at $14 billion. “We learned a lot through the last three years of what doesn't work,” said Breslow. “I think I've come out of the experience of the last three years with a couple probably PhDs in law and governance.” The 30 Under 30 alum credits Bolt’s new board with helping him to weather several rounds of layoffs, investor disputes and now resolved lawsuits with major customers like Authentic Brands Group and sportswear maker Fanatics. “We needed to make sure our board was all in and once we finally got that right we were able to withstand the challenges,” he said. After removing investors like Activant’s Steve Sarracino and Tribe Capital’s Arjun Sethi from Bolt’s board, Breslow hired several friends and associates like journalist Esther Wojcicki and crypto investor Brock Pierce, later replacing them with property developer Joel Schreiber. Court filings indicate that Bolt’s board is now made up of Schreiber, who is embroiled in a $100 million legal battle with real estate giant Starwood, and Breslow’s friend and music producer Larrance Dopson, and gaming entrepreneur Michael Carter. Bolt did not respond to a request to name its new board. “I didn't make the mistakes that I was accused of making, but I made plenty of other mistakes.” Bolt and Breslow have also churned through at least six major law firms over the last three years of legal battles. “You name a top law firm, there's a good chance we've hired them and even fired them or had them quit on us,” said Breslow. “Ultimately, we had to determine our own legal strategy…because of that, we were able to do things that a lot of law firms thought were impossible, find peace, find settlements, find outcomes that were really good.” Breslow was characteristically bullish on the prospect for Bolt now he is back at the helm, talking up deals with ecommerce website Revolve, Richemont Group and LVMH’s Benefit Cosmetics. He also pushed the idea of Bolt expanding from offering a one-click checkout service for retailers to pushing financial products, crypto and peer to peer payments to the 80 million shoppers who have made a purchase using its platform — a so-called “super app.” British banking startup Revolut, which was valued at a $45 billion in share sale in August, seems to be Breslow’s inspiration. But catching up with the London-based company, which generated $545 million profit on $2.2 billion of revenue in 2023, will take a lot of work from Bolt’s new CEO. Over the same period, Bolt recorded a $302 million loss on just $27 million of revenue.

Title: Trump White House has asked U.S. military to develop options for the Panama Canal, officials say

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time WASHINGTON — The White House has directed the U.S. military to draw up options to increase the American troop presence in Panama to achieve President Donald Trump’s goal of “reclaiming” the Panama Canal, according to two U.S. officials familiar with the planning. In his joint address to Congress last week, Trump said that "to further enhance our national security, my administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal.” Since then, administration officials have not said what "reclaiming" means. U.S. Southern Command is developing potential plans from partnering more closely with Panamanian security forces to the less likely option of U.S. troops’ seizing the Panama Canal by force, the officials said. Whether military force is used, the officials added, depends on how much Panamanian security forces agree to partner with the United States. The Trump administration’s goal is to increase the U.S. military presence in Panama to diminish China’s influence there, particularly access to the canal, the officials said. Panama and China deny there is any foreign interference in the 50-mile canal, whose neutrality is enshrined in Panama’s Constitution. Chinese officials have accused the United States of using "coercion" to pressure Panamanian officials to block Chinese aid projects. The U.S. officials told NBC News that the commander of U.S. Southern Command, Adm. Alvin Holsey, presented draft strategies to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth this week. Hegseth is expected to visit Panama next month. The officials cautioned that a U.S. invasion of Panama is unlikely and would come under serious consideration only if a larger American military presence in Panama does not achieve Trump’s goal of reclaiming the waterway, the officials said. Neither the Pentagon nor the Panamanian Embassy in Washington immediately responded to requests for comment. Trump has said he intends to return ownership of the canal to the United States after Panama gained control of the area more than a quarter-century ago under a treaty signed by the Carter administration. Privately, Trump has told his advisers that he sees a U.S. military presence in Panama and on the canal itself as critical to that effort, the U.S. officials said. Trump has also made it clear that he wants U.S. service members to be visible in the canal zone as a show of force. Trump administration officials have argued that China has too large a presence near the canal. In the event of a conflict, they say, Beijing could shut down the canal to American shipping, including military ships. During a visit to Panama last month, Secretary of State Marco Rubio told Panamanian President José Raúl Mulino that “the status quo is unacceptable” regarding China’s presence in Panama. Mulino said the Panamanian government alone administers the canal and denied ceding operation of the canal to China in any way. After Panama declined to renew a key infrastructure agreement with China, Chinese Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said that the projects were part of Beijing's Belt and Road development initiative and that China “firmly opposes the U.S. smearing and undermining the Belt and Road cooperation through means of pressure and coercion.” Last year, Army Gen. Laura Richardson, now retired, then the commander of Southern Command, testified to the House Armed Services Committee that China is "playing the long game." Richardson warned that Chinese government-backed economic development projects are "dual-use sites and facilities" that can be quickly flipped and used for military purposes. "The PRC messages its investments as peaceful, but in fact, many serve as points of future multi-domain access for the PLA and strategic naval choke points," she said, referring to the People's Republic of China and the People's Liberation Army. "In Panama, PRC-controlled state-owned enterprises, SOEs, continue to bid on projects related to the Panama Canal — a global strategic choke point.” The U.S. military has more than 200 troops in Panama, but the number fluctuates as troops rotate in and out, according to a defense official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Some of them include Special Forces units working with Panamanian forces to protect the country from internal threats, insurgencies or unrest. Potential administration strategies include simply ensuring that U.S. ships have safe passage through the canal to restoring total U.S. ownership and operation of it, officials said. Other options under consideration include using the U.S. military to secure existing ports in Panama, build new ports in Panama or use the Army Corps of Engineers to operate the canal’s locks, officials said. There are also discussions about opening Army Jungle Schools, or training camps, in Panama, like the ones where U.S. troops were trained in jungle warfare until the canal was formally handed over to Panama in 1999. Another focus of the ongoing planning is potentially positioning U.S. military forces near Panama in the event of a regional war or a threat to the United States. In that scenario, the U.S. military would aim to secure the canal and eliminate China’s access to it. American officials cautioned that the United States would block Chinese transit through the canal only in the event of war. The Panama Canal is one of the world’s busiest waterways, with the majority of the cargo that passes through it originating in the United States or heading to it. If the canal were blocked, ships would have to transit around South America, sharply increasing the cost and time of each voyage. The United States constructed the canal from 1904 to 1914 after a failed French effort. In 1977, after long-running protests by Panamanians, President Jimmy Carter signed a treaty that turned control of the canal over to Panama. In 1989, during the George H.W. Bush administration, U.S. forces invaded Panama and ousted its leader, Manuel Noriega, who was later convicted of drug trafficking. In his joint address to Congress last week, Trump said the United States was already moving to limit Chinese presence in the canal. “Just today, a large American company announced they are buying both ports around the Panama Canal and lots of other things having to do with the Panama Canal and a couple of other canals,” he said. The U.S. investment company BlackRock is part of a group buying a 90% stake in the Panama Ports Company, which operates the ports of Balboa and Cristobal on the Pacific and Atlantic ends of the canal. The stake is being purchased from a Hong Kong-based firm, CK Hutchinson, for $22.8 billion.

ByBilly Bambrough ByBilly Bambrough , Senior Contributor. 03/13 update below. This post was originally published on March 11 Bitcoin and crypto prices have moved sharply lower, following stock markets, as fears swirl the bitcoin price could be teetering on the verge of a major crash. Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes’ CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" The bitcoin price has dropped under $80,000 per bitcoin, dragging down the wider crypto market that’s now erased $1 trillion of value in just a month (even as bullish traders bet on a U.S. president Donald Trump “game-changer”). Now, as Elon Musk issues a surprise crypto price warning, the chief executive of the world’s largest asset manager BlackRock has warned Trump’s trade policies will stoke inflation—pouring cold water on hopes the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates through 2025. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink has warned inflation could make a come back in 2025, ... [+] potentially hitting the bitcoin price and crypto market as the Federal Reserve dials back its planned interest rate cuts. "I think if we all are becoming a little more nationalistic—and I’m not saying that’s a bad thing, you know, it does resonate with me—that it’s going to have elevated inflation," BlackRock’s Larry Fink told CeraWeek conference attendees, it was reported by Reuters. 03/13 update: U.S. inflation has slowed to 2.8% in February from a year earlier, boosting the case for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates but failing to offset fears that U.S. president Donald Trump’s global tariff trade war will push up prices through 2025. The latest consumer price index (CPI) reading came in below January’s 3% and the 2.9% expected by economists, according to a Reuters poll. “Today’s lower-than-expected CPI should be bullish, signaling faster rate cuts, but crypto hasn’t reacted strongly," Youwei Yang, chief economist at BIT Mining, said in emailed comments. "Weeks of market fear require more than a single good print to regain confidence. The real issue is Trump’s aggressive tariffs, which risk making inflation stickier while also crashing markets and triggering layoffs, particularly by the Doge department of government efficiency. This puts the Fed in a bind: High inflation from tariffs makes rate cuts harder. Market crashes and job losses pressure the Fed to cut rates sooner. Cutting too early could reignite inflation, making future policy tougher. Stocks are bouncing back, but crypto remains sluggish. Investors want stronger support from the White House or Fed, especially after last week’s crypto summit failed to reassure markets. Until clearer signals emerge, fear and uncertainty will weigh on crypto market sentiment." Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs economists have upped their odds of a recession over the next 12 months from 15% to 20%, pointing to Trump’s economic policies as the “key risk." Yardeni Research economists have also raised their recession odds, increasing them from 20% to 35% due to "Trump 2.0’s head-spinning barrage of executives orders, firings, and tariffs." Last week, Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell said the Fed is in no rush to cut rates, with the labor market still strong and inflation on a bumpy path toward its 2% goal. The CME FedWatch Tool shows the market is heavily betting the Fed leaves rates on hold at its March meeting next week but is split over whether rates will be cut in May.

On Wednesday, the latest U.S. inflation data in the form of the consumer price index (CPI) will drop, with consumer prices expected to have ticked up in February, according to Bloomberg, highlighting the Fed’s slow progress on battling inflation and potentially raising the specter of stagflation—characterized by an economic slowdown coupled with spiraling price rises. "This market downturn is largely driven by broader economic concerns, including fears of a U.S. recession and persistent inflation," Sean Dawson, head of research at decentralized options trading platform Derive.xyz, said in emailed comments. “The market is facing significant challenges as the macroeconomic environment worsens, and crypto assets are no exception. With bearish sentiment building, traders are turning to downside hedging strategies, especially as volatility surges across both traditional and crypto markets. The coming weeks will be critical for assessing how the broader economic situation impacts digital asset prices and trading behavior."

In-kind redemptions and creations allow for the direct exchange of the underlying assets of the ETF (Bitcoin or Ethereum) for ETF shares, bypassing the need for cash. This method eliminates the need for participants to sell the underlying crypto to create shares, reducing the bid/ask spread and avoiding additional broker commissions. The proposal, published Thursday morning, pushes the boundaries of crypto ETFs in the U.S., opening new avenues for investors to tap into Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) without holding the assets physically. As the SEC reviews Cboe’s proposed rule change, a public comment period has been opened, allowing stakeholders to share their thoughts before a final decision is made. Authorized participants—institutions involved in the creation and redemption process—will be eligible to use the in-kind transaction model, says the filing. Individual investors will still be required to use the cash-based model when purchasing or redeeming ETF shares. The Invesco Galaxy filing mirrors similar moves by major ETF providers, including BlackRock, which has recently sought approval for in-kind redemption mechanisms. In a related tweet, Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart pointed out in January that in-kind creations and redemptions should help “streamline” the ETF market. Wow. Way too many questions and this stuff goes pretty deep in the weeds. So i'll keep it high level and answer "What does this mean?" Not all that much for individual retail investors. Mostly what it means is that ETFs should trade even more efficiently than they already do… pic.twitter.com/LWYsKmo5sH — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) January 24, 2025 The analyst explained that fewer steps and parties would be involved in the process, while sharing an image BlackRock reportedly used in a November 2023 SEC meeting to advocate for in-kind transactions for spot Bitcoin ETFs. “In my opinion the ETFs should have been allowed to do this from the get-go but the Dem SEC commissioners were against it,” Seyffart said. Last January, the SEC approved the Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF, making history as one of the first spot Bitcoin ETFs to be listed on a U.S. exchange. Following the approval of its Bitcoin counterpart, the SEC granted approval for the Invesco Galaxy Ethereum ETF in May of last year. Like the Bitcoin ETF, it holds Ethereum as the underlying asset and allows shares to be traded on a regulated exchange. Even so, both Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs have faced challenges in recent days. On Tuesday, Bitcoin ETFs experienced significant outflows, with $371 million withdrawn, marking the seventh consecutive day of withdrawals, according to data from UK-based investment management firm Farside Investors. Ethereum ETFs were similarly impacted, with outflows of $21.57 million, extending their streak to five days.

Title: DB news X account hack leads to 20% Trump memecoin pump and dump

DB asserts hardware-based two-factor authentication usage suggests potential X employee exploit. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. On March 13, hackers seemingly took control of DB, a well-known crypto news platform, using its X account to spread false information about Donald Trump’s TRUMP memecoin and a fabricated BlackRock ETF filing for Hyperliquid. The misleading posts had an immediate impact. TRUMP’s price surged by 20% before quickly collapsing, while the fake ETF news caused a separate 6% price fluctuation for Hyperliquid’s HYPE token. Blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain revealed that a trader attempted to capitalize on the chaos by withdrawing 504,820 USDC from Binance to buy TRUMP tokens. However, after the truth emerged, the trader sold at a loss, losing $26,820 in USDC within minutes. Following the incident, DB deleted the unauthorized posts and advised users to ignore any information shared during the breach. This attack on DB’s account aligns with a pattern of recent breaches targeting high-profile crypto-related accounts on X. DB pointed out that its compromised account had no linked third-party apps, no API key leaks, and was protected by YubiKey two-factor authentication. This led the platform to suspect an internal vulnerability or a compromised X employee as the likely source of the breach. According to DB: “[We are] assuming a compromised X employee or similar, all keys and sessions have been reset regardless.” Considering this, web3 security platform Harpie noted similarities to previous attacks on Dogwifcoin, Solana-based Jupiter Exchange, and memecoin launchpad Pump.fun. Blockchain investigator ZachXBT suggested these hacks might stem from social engineering tactics aimed at X employees. He speculated that attackers might be manipulating the social media site staff with fraudulent documents or exploiting weaknesses in the platform’s internal controls. Meanwhile, the increasing frequency of these attacks raises concerns about the security of crypto-related accounts on X. Over the years, hackers have continued to exploit high-profile platforms to spread false information and deploy phishing schemes that have resulted in significant losses for crypto users.

Title: The Trump Regime’s Climate “Realism” Is Even Worse Than It Sounds
URL: https://newrepublic.com/article/192678/trump-chris-wright-climate-realism
Time Published: 2025-03-13T10:00:00Z

In Houston this week, the leading lights of the global oil and gas industry have gathered to congratulate themselves. Buoyed by the Trump administration and the prospect of surging energy demand from AI, executives at CERAWeek by S&P Global hailed themselves as sober-minded pragmatists who’ve finally prevailed in the alleged war on their business model. “We’re seeing some reality come back in the conversation,” Chevron CEO Mike Wirth told the crowd. Saudi Aramco CEO Amin H. Nasser similarly described the “inherent flaws in the current energy transition plan” whereby unnamed parties sought to “almost entirely” replace hydrocarbons “virtually overnight.” The future of energy, he added, “is not only about sustainability. Security and affordability must share the stage.” Fracking executive turned Energy Secretary Chris Wright, who calls himself a “climate realist,” echoed the sentiment and took it one step further in his remarks to the conference, describing climate change as simply the “side effect of building the modern world.” The cures for that, he argued—“the Biden administration’s irrational quasi-religious policies”—have been “far more destructive than the disease. There are no winners in that world except for politicians and rapidly growing interest groups.” The supposed “realism” being projected in Houston isn’t exactly novel. Fossil fuel executives and the politicians they donate to routinely describe themselves as the victims of some fantastical green plot. Despite the fact that U.S. executives enjoyed record profits and production during the Biden administration, they love to whine whenever Democrats are in charge and take a victory lap when Republicans kick them out. What’s novel about this round of self-serving oil and gas industry grandstanding is how much it aligns with the “realism” expressed by ostensibly more climate-conscious leaders. So-called investor-led alliances to align the financial sector behind climate goals have largely collapsed as bankers and asset managers follow the example of fossil fuel companies, which have walked back and reversed climate pledges. The Net-Zero Asset Managers Alliance suspended operations after its largest member—Blackrock—left earlier this year. The six largest U.S. banks (Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley, and Wells Fargo) all opted to ditch the Net-Zero Banking Alliance in the lead-up to Inauguration Day. Billionaires Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates—who championed their climate philanthropy over the last several years—have warmed to Trump and stayed silent about his attacks on climate statutes. Breakthrough Energy, the climate group Gates funds, dramatically cut giving to climate groups and slashed dozens of staff in the U.S. and Europe. Europe’s push to boost defense spending in response to Trump needn’t necessarily come at the expense of climate priorities, but some politicians are certainly framing green priorities as indulgent luxury items that should take a backseat to rearmament. And governments that have preached fiscal restraint with regard to green spending are broadcasting a new willingness to open their pocketbooks for weapons. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk’s pitch for ramping up military spending included a rant against the bloc’s climate and environmental plans, blaming them for “prohibitively” high energy costs and limiting European competitiveness. Urging a ​​“full and very critical” review of all European Green Deal laws, Tusk warned in Brussels that Europe “cannot become a continent of naïve people and ideas. If we go bankrupt, no one will care about the natural environment in the world anymore.” After successive German governments warned that deficit spending on climate priorities would lead to financial ruin, the two parties likely to form its new coalition government, the CDU and SPD, announced their intention to loosen the country’s supposedly ironclad debt limit in order to accommodate new defense spending. Bloomberg reports that the Netherlands and Germany will redirect $2.5 billion and $1 billion in climate spending for poorer countries, respectively, toward defense priorities; Finland, Sweden, and Switzerland are considering similar plans. French President Emanuel Macron hopes to raise military spending from 2 percent to 3.5 percent of gross domestic product—about $32 billion more annually. The French government also just released its long-awaited plan to adapt to a world that’s four degrees Celsius (7.2 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than preindustrial levels by 2100, well above the Paris Climate Agreement’s goal of limiting temperature rise to “well below” two degrees Celsius. Environment Minister Agnès Pannier-Runacher announced the country will spend just under $1.75 billion to prepare for a “realistic” level of warming that the government predicts will devastate its most important economic sectors, especially agriculture and tourism, and slash GDP by 13 percent. These European leaders and finance executives believe that climate change is a real and pressing threat. None would venture so far as to brag they don’t “do climate change crap,” as U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth boasted this week. But the paranoid, reactionary “realism” preached by oil and gas execs in Houston this week has plenty in common with the more genteel versions being peddled in Brussels and on Wall Street, where climate goals aren’t denounced so much as deprioritized in budgets and dropped from talking points. Oil and gas companies have long recognized the very prospect of an energy transition as an existential threat to their business model. They spent decades and fortunes on lobbying and disinformation efforts to deny the climate was changing at all and block any efforts that might impact their bottom lines. In the financial and, now, tech sector—where companies are angling to build out huge fleets of energy-intensive data centers for AI—there’s still plenty of money to be made from fossil fuels. These executives don’t have much reason to worry about the taps getting turned off, or even slowed. That’s because the governments that broadcast their flashy net-zero commitments when those things were fashionable have reached a more mundane conclusion, cemented by Trump’s election: Decarbonizing is too hard. The problem with this line of thinking ought to be immediately apparent to anyone with even a cursory familiarity with climate projections. The catastrophic effects of climate change outweigh the costs of addressing it in just about every model. No amount of shoulder shrugging is going to keep that bill from coming due. It isn’t “realistic” for governments, especially, to pretend that rising temperatures won’t wreck economies and displace millions in order to focus on other priorities, or to half-heartedly prepare for a world warmed by four degrees Celsius. It’s delusional. Kate Aronoff is a staff writer at The New Republic.

Jack Power reports, while he also breaks down what is at stake in the negotiations. Donald Trump’s threat to impose a 25 per cent tariff on goods coming into the US from Canada and Mexico would damage Smurfit WestRock’s paper and packaging business although the full cost of that impact is not clear, the Dublin-based company’s president and chief executive has told Ciaran Hancock, host of The Irish Times Inside Business podcast.

Title: TRUMP meme coin pumps, then dumps after fake utility news

Share this article The TRUMP meme coin saw a sudden 19% surge before plummeting after false reports circulated that it would have real-world utility. The digital asset jumped from $10.4 to $12.4 after DB, a prominent crypto news outlet, posted on X that the TRUMP token would “have real utility” on Thursday. The surge was short-lived as a follow-up post appeared approximately seven minutes later claiming the account had been compromised. The TRUMP token price fell to $10.8 following the statement. Initially, it was uncertain whether hackers or DB posted the second tweet. Ansem and others in the crypto community observed a grammatical error in the tweet, suggesting the security breach had yet to be resolved. Some X users reported that DB’s account also shared fake news that BlackRock had filed for a spot HYPE ETF. DB has since removed the unauthorized posts and issued a statement asking users to disregard messages posted during the security breach. The news outlet confirmed an investigation is in progress and will provide updates when available. Share this article Sign in to your account Don’t have an account?

Title: Sarah Healy on becoming European Indoor champion: ‘I knew people thought I was capable of a lot more’

Time Published: 2025-03-13T06:00:01Z
Full Content:
Sarah Healy is sitting in a hotel room in Dubai, a glowing picture of health and confidence, and talking openly through some of the back pages of her running career. As if she was another athlete then, and very different from that now. She takes the Zoom call on a six-day stopover en route to Nanjing, where at the World Indoor Championships starting on Friday week, Healy hopes to add another medal to the gold she won on the European indoor stage in Apeldoorn last Sunday – that 3,000m victory at the age of 24 a liberation of sorts. By her own repeated admission, Healy had often buckled under the pressure of her own expectations, and those of others, losing focus in races right when it mattered most. Perhaps worse still she lost some of the enjoyment from the sport she first discovered at Blackrock AC in South Dublin at age nine. “I’ve always enjoyed it, always enjoyed training and everything,” she says. “I think it’s more having fun with competing that has been the problem. I’m not even sure if I’ve taken it too seriously, but I’ve also associated competing with some really big disappointments, and I think when you’re bringing that much emotion into it, it can make it more scary, because you know there’s this possibility that you’re going to be so devastated. “So I think this indoor season, I’ve kind of like just been reminding myself that it’s not such a be all, end all thing. And remind myself that I’m going to be okay no matter what happens. And then that in turn just makes it less nerve-wracking, or less pressurising, because it just doesn’t feel as daunting that way. “I suppose it’s just trying to appreciate where you are, realising how lucky I am to get to do this, to travel around and race as a job. That is really cool, so just enjoying the competing aspect a little bit more, and obviously it brings out better performances.” This sort of thing can happen to any athlete, only for Healy, given her exceptional underage success which included a European under-18 1,500m/3,000m double in 2018, any growing pains entering the senior ranks were certainly magnified. The 2022 European Championships in Munich, for example, where she bombed out in her 1,500m heat after running a world-class 4:02.86 earlier that summer, taking three seconds off Sonia O’Sullivan’s Irish under-23 record set 31 years previously in Monaco. Healy mentions several critical turning points since then, bringing her to where she is now. It started with her move to Manchester in late 2023 to train with husband-and-wife coaching team of Trevor Painter and Jenny Meadows, whose M11 group includes Keely Hodgkinson, the Olympic 800m champion in Paris. “Just because that was a really hard decision to make, and quite a big thing to do,” she says. “And then I think it also kind of represented me sort of becoming a full-time athlete, and really just kind of going all in on athletics. So I took confidence in the fact I was able to get through that and make a home for myself over there. “Then of course it was obviously a turning point just in terms of having a team and training group, which has physically, obviously, pushed me on so much. “Then I think the other major turning point would be the Olympics last year, and kind of just the aftermath of that [she finished fourth in the Paris repechage, one place short of the semi-final]. But I think after some time, I managed to turn that experience into a bit of a lesson, or a big lesson, and this indoor season really changed the way I was approaching things, based off that.” Moving to Manchester also afforded her the first-hand experience of living and training alongside Hodgkinson and Georgia Hunter Bell, who won the Olympic, 1,500m bronze in Paris. “When you think of someone like her [Keely], who’s just been such a prodigy and an Olympic champion, you feel like they probably wouldn’t be a normal person and do normal things, but Keely is a similar age to me and is just like a friend now, and so it kind of normalises that as well. “She’s training really, really hard but at the same time, I think both with her and Georgia that they have something special in their mindset as well. And I think in Paris last year, Keely just had that mindset. And the same with Georgia, she just thinks, ‘no, there’s no reason I can’t come in here and be one of the best’. Obviously, they’re both physically extremely talented as well, but you need that mindset too.” [ Sarah Healy, Mark English and Kate O’Connor to chase more medals at World Indoor ChampionshipsOpens in new window ] Comparisons with O’Sullivan may continue for a while yet – O’Sullivan won a World Indoor 3,000m silver back in 1997 – but Healy views those things differently now. “I think when people would say things like that, I definitely never got carried away and thought, ‘oh, I’m going to be amazing just because I’ve done these things as a junior’. “It’s just been the last few years, as a senior athlete, I underperformed a good number of times at major championships. Because it happened so many times, I definitely felt a bit of pressure to perform, because I knew people thought I was capable of a lot more than what I was doing. “I think another thing that has helped my performances recently has been really just focusing on myself. At the end of the day, no one really cares too much what I do, apart from myself. I think worrying about other people, what they think, is definitely not helpful.” Ian O'Riordan is an Irish Times sports journalist writing on athletics Latest news from the world of sport, along with the best in opinion from our outstanding team of sports writers © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: Two months ago, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon had a curt message for people protesting President Donald Trump’s tariff policy: “Get over it.” But with stock markets lower and cracks appearing to form in the US economy, Dimon himself might not be over it. “I don’t think the average American consumer who wakes up in the morning and goes to work… changes what they’re going to do because they read about tariffs,” Dimon said in an interview with Semafor on Wednesday. “But I do think companies might,” he added. “Uncertainty is not a good thing.” Dimon appeared to shift his focus on tariffs after the CEO of America’s largest bank said to “get over it,” when discussing tariffs at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. He said they could be “an economic tool” or “an economic weapon” to promote fair trade, depending how they’re used. “I would put in perspective: If it’s a little inflationary, but it’s good for national security, so be it,” Dimon said in an interview with CNBC at the time. “National security trumps a little bit more inflation,” he added. Since then, Trump’s on-and-off tariff policy has caused volatility in the stock market. Although broader markets rebounded on Wednesday, the S&P 500 was still down more than 7% over one month. On Wednesday, Trump imposed sweeping 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum imported into the United States — the latest round of tariffs in a global trade war — with Canada and the European Union swiftly retaliating. He has said his goal is to revitalize American manufacturing, slow illegal immigration and end fentanyl smuggling, but economists have warned that broad-based tariffs threaten to drive up prices on everything from food to new homes. Dimon wasn’t the only CEO sounding off on Wednesday about the risks of tariffs. Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, said he believed the economy was weakening due to tariffs. “The collective impact in the short run is that people are pausing, they’re pulling back,” Fink told CNN’s Kayla Tausche in an exclusive interview. “Talking to CEOs throughout the economy, I hear that the economy is weakening as we speak.” Still, Fink said the Trump administration’s policies, including tariffs, could be beneficial to the United States in the long run. “Right now the president is focusing on tariffs, but when he talks about reciprocal tariffs, actually, that may bring down tariffs over the long run,” Fink said, adding that he remains bullish on America in the long term.

Title: First, World Leaders Complain, Then They Do What Trump Wants

Skip to comments. Posted on 03/12/2025 5:04:04 PM PDT by bimboeruption Even before Trump took office, he began laying out a long list of demands for both U.S. allies and adversaries—demands he believed would ultimately benefit American taxpayers. Despite facing resistance, with many critics calling him “Hitler,” the world is slowly falling in line with his requests. Canada backed down from an energy export surcharge threatened against the U.S., Mexico rounded up cartel members and handed them over to U.S. authorities, Zelensky agreed to a ceasefire, and Europe is ramping up its defense spending, assuming the financial responsibility for Ukraine’s defense. Panama withdrew from the Belt and Road Initiative and then sold key assets to BlackRock, effectively neutralizing the Chinese threat to the Panama Canal. Canada’s Retreat from Export Surcharge: Ontario Premier Doug Ford announced that he was suspending the 25% surcharge on electricity exports to the U.S., which had been imposed earlier that week. This decision followed a conversation with U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, during which they agreed to meet in Washington to discuss a renewed United States-Mexico-Canada-Agreement ahead of President Trump’s April 2 tariff deadline While Canada is matching U.S. tariffs dollar for dollar, it has also agreed to a $1.3 billion investment in enhancing border security. This includes joint efforts with U.S. authorities to combat transnational criminal activities, particularly fentanyl trafficking. Mexico’s Cooperation on Cartel Crackdown: The Mexican government conducted a large-scale operation to round up cartel members, directly handing over key figures to U.S. authorities for prosecution. This move came after considerable pressure from Washington, where Trump demanded that Mexico take a stronger stance on drug cartels and border security. Mexico’s actions were perceived as a necessary step to maintain diplomatic ties with the U.S. and avoid any re-escalation of trade barriers or tariffs. Ukraine’s Agreement to a Ceasefire: President Volodymyr Zelenskyy agreed to a 30-day ceasefire with Russia, a move strongly supported by the United States. Trump had advocated for a ceasefire to push both Ukraine and Russia toward negotiations. Despite initial resistance from Ukrainian leadership to compromise on territorial issues, Zelenskyy ultimately agreed, seeing the potential benefits in securing continued U.S. military and financial support. Europe’s Increased Defense Spending: European military and political leaders are holding high-level talks this week to discuss rearming the continent and increasing aid for Ukraine, amid concerns over a less engaged United States. Dutch Defense Minister Ruben Brekelmans emphasized the urgency of fortifying Europe’s security, noting that Europe can no longer rely on U.S. protection. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called for a significant boost in defense spending, proposing an $873 billion plan to rearm Europe and support Ukraine, including relaxing fiscal rules and increasing defense spending by 1.5% of GDP annually for the next four years. Europe Assuming Ukraine Defense Responsibility: France’s President Emmanuel Macron took decisive steps toward forming a European peacekeeping force for Ukraine. Macron’s meeting in Paris with military leaders from over 30 nations, including European countries, Japan, and Canada. While the media may frame this as either a win for globalism or a loss of power for the U.S., Europe is essentially doing what Trump has advocated for all along: he wants America out of Ukraine and expects Europe to address its own security concerns—something it has neglected to do for the past 80 years. Panama’s Withdrawal from the Belt and Road Initiative: In 2025, Panama has withdrawn from China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which had initially been signed in 2017 under pressure from Beijing. This decision was influenced by U.S. demands for countries to limit Chinese influence in critical infrastructure, particularly concerning strategic assets like the Panama Canal. Panama also reached an agreement to sell a controlling stake in its largest ports to BlackRock, an American investment firm. This sale further aligns Panama with U.S. interests, as it reduces China’s presence and strengthens the U.S. economic influence in the region. The move was seen as a direct response to Trump’s call for Latin American nations to reduce reliance on China and prioritize U.S. partnerships, reflecting Panama’s compliance with U.S. demands to safeguard the Panama Canal from Chinese control. The international response to President Trump’s demands highlights a trend where countries, after initial resistance or criticism, eventually agree to ‘America First.

The move was seen as a direct response to Trump’s call for Latin American nations to reduce reliance on China and prioritize U.S. partnerships, reflecting Panama’s compliance with U.S. demands to safeguard the Panama Canal from Chinese control.

Trump had advocated for a ceasefire to push both Ukraine and Russia toward negotiations. Despite initial resistance from Ukrainian leadership to compromise on territorial issues, Zelenskyy ultimately agreed, seeing the potential benefits in securing continued U.S. military and financial support. Europe’s Increased Defense Spending: European military and political leaders are holding high-level talks this week to discuss rearming the continent and increasing aid for Ukraine, amid concerns over a less engaged United States. Dutch Defense Minister Ruben Brekelmans emphasized the urgency of fortifying Europe’s security, noting that Europe can no longer rely on U.S. protection. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called for a significant boost in defense spending, proposing an $873 billion plan to rearm Europe and support Ukraine, including relaxing fiscal rules and increasing defense spending by 1.5% of GDP annually for the next four years. Europe Assuming Ukraine Defense Responsibility: France’s President Emmanuel Macron took decisive steps toward forming a European peacekeeping force for Ukraine. Macron’s meeting in Paris with military leaders from over 30 nations, including European countries, Japan, and Canada. While the media may frame this as either a win for globalism or a loss of power for the U.S., Europe is essentially doing what Trump has advocated for all along: he wants America out of Ukraine and expects Europe to address its own security concerns—something it has neglected to do for the past 80 years. Panama’s Withdrawal from the Belt and Road Initiative: In 2025, Panama has withdrawn from China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which had initially been signed in 2017 under pressure from Beijing. This decision was influenced by U.S. demands for countries to limit Chinese influence in critical infrastructure, particularly concerning strategic assets like the Panama Canal.

Title: ATL Hawks Women’s Empowerment Night Featured A Special SheLEADS Graduation & Shamea Morton’s High-Energy Halftime Performance

The Atlanta Hawks recently celebrated Women’s History Month with their annual Women’s Empowerment Night presented by BMW, recognizing women in leadership, business, and sports at State Farm Arena, and we got a double dribble of all the deets. The evening featured a special graduation ceremony for the SheLEADS Class of 2025, a halftime performance from Shamea Morton dedicated to women’s empowerment, and a star-studded lineup of speakers and honorees.

Entering State Farm Arena alone as media, I was guided through the media entrance, passing through tunnels beneath the bleachers where athletes prepare for the game. Security personnel, trainers, and physical therapists moved efficiently, ensuring everything was in place before tip-off. I was escorted to the event through the VIP elevators and hallways by Tai McDonald from the Atlanta Hawks Communications team. She led the way to the SheLEADS graduation room, which was filled with the program’s participants and their supporters, preparing to celebrate their achievements. Source: Lauryn Bass The setting reflected the significance of the moment—decorated with glass windows, hues of pink and florals to set the scene of the ceremony. They also served hors d’oeuvres! The SheLEADS Class of 2025 celebrated the completion of its eight-month leadership development program, which supports early-career women in business, sports, entrepreneurship, and STEAM fields. The wonderful host keeping up the energy of the night was media maven MiAsia Symone, Radio Host of Atlanta’s #1 Hip-Hop station Hot 107.9. The program, powered by BMW and the Atlanta Hawks, was designed to address key barriers preventing women from advancing in leadership roles. Source: Lauryn Bass According to Alexis Roe, VP of DEI Impact & Strategic Initiatives at the Atlanta Hawks, who served as the program’s moderator, the eight-month structure was intentional. “I was a part of Lead Atlanta and a number of other leadership development programs and the reality is: after one work day you’re not going to learn all the things, right? So what we really did was curate an experience. We looked at all the women in the workplace and studied key things that women struggle with. At the time, women in Georgia ranked number forty-nine in the country for ‘Women’s Empowerment,’ which is women’s access to healthcare and education. We couldn’t understand why, out of all the amazing women in Georgia, they were not able to climb and rise into leadership and economic mobility.” Alexis Roe & Lauryn Bass/ Source: Lauryn Bass The night featured a keynote address from Margaret Lane, Executive Vice President of Talent & Development at Penske Automotive Group, as well as a panel discussion titled, “Navigating the Path to Leadership: Wisdom and Tactics from Trailblazing Women.” Source: Lauryn Bass Lane emphasized how impactful a program like this would have been for her as a young professional. “I would’ve given anything for something like this. The young people [in] this program, I have no doubt that in the future they are going to be fabulous. I have a lot of confidence in them, and I am so excited.” With DEI programs facing challenges nationwide, Lane also spoke on the importance of continued investment in initiatives like SheLEADS. “I’m hoping so! No matter what you are, what acronym you use, or who you call yourself to be—it’s the inclusivity that’s so important. Why wouldn’t you want to be? The Atlanta Hawks and the Atlanta-area BMW Centers have done such an incredible job supporting this.” For the graduates, the impact of SheLEADS extended beyond professional development—it fostered a sense of belonging and confidence. Source: Lauryn Bass Teevyah Yuva Raju, business strategist and COO Team at BlackRock, shared her excitement about completing the program. “I feel incredible—for myself and my fellow SheLeaders! We learned a lot and I can’t wait to see all of us grow in the upcoming years.” When asked what SheLEADS offered that only participants would understand, she highlighted a common struggle for women in leadership. “The biggest thing I’ve learned is to overcome imposter syndrome. A lot of the women who are SheLeads sisters to me are in incredible positions. They’ve taught us that every position that we are in is well-deserved and that we’re going to continue to grow because we deserve it. We deserve where we’re at and we deserve where we’re going.” For Meag Taylor, founder of WomenInRadio and digital content producer at The Steve Harvey Morning Show, SheLEADS wasn’t just about professional growth—it provided genuine friendships and support. “SheLEADS is the best decision I made since moving to Atlanta in 2020. I am so happy to have been accepted into the program. The quality of women I have met and gained as friends is just amazing. We really support each other in real life, and oftentimes, that’s hard to find.” Janna Pruiett, Customer Success Manager at Omnissa, echoed similar sentiments, emphasizing the invaluable community and confidence-building she gained. “Being part of the SheLEADS program was an incredibly empowering experience! I loved connecting with so many dynamic women from different industries, each with unique insights and inspiring stories. The program provided an invaluable space for learning, growth, and collaboration, and I left feeling more motivated than ever. The Atlanta Hawks and State Farm Arena truly created a community where women can thrive, and I’m grateful to have been a part of it!” You could feel the energy in the room from the testimonies, trophies, champagne toasts and gift baskets. This was a space where women were giving back to each other, and it spoke volumes. This truly was a celebration that fell on the perfect night of the year, #InternationalWomensDay! Source: Lauryn Bass While the Indiana Pacers were the Hawks’ opponent for the night, the real focus was on uplifting women across industries. Source: Paras Griffin / Getty The night’s celebrations began with Shamea Morton performing the national anthem. Source: Paras Griffin / Getty A Georgia native, former Hawks cheerleader, and new cast member of The Real Housewives of Atlanta, Morton brought an extra dose of star power to the event. Also seen on the scene was Morton’s husband, Gerald Mwangi, and the housewife’s former radio co-host, Big Tigger. Source: Paras Griffin / Getty Play At halftime, the arena lit up with an all-female Drumline Live performance, paying tribute to the HBCU marching band legacy with powerful rhythms and choreography. Throughout the evening, the ATL Hawks continued to give tribute to women who inspire the world every day. Play The ATL Dancers also performed a special routine featuring women from the Hawks’ corporate team, reinforcing the organization’s commitment to diversity both on and off the court. There was even an interactive cartoon race between three cars—two male and one female—for children to engage with during the night. Though the male cars played dirty to win, the female car kept her energy and stayed on her path to victory. The crowd was able to cheer her onto victory, and to recognize that even the smallest things can impact children in their game seats. Women’s Empowerment Night was more than a themed game—it was a testament to the Hawks’ and BMW’s commitment to investing in women. What a perfect game to win against the Pacers. Curtis Snyder, BMW’s Southern Region Marketing Manager, reinforced why programs like this matter. “At BMW, we believe in the power of women—our daughters, mothers, and partners—to inspire change, break barriers, and lead with confidence.” There was everything to gain this night!

Title: AI to fuel bumper year for M&A in US power sector

Business FILE PHOTO: A new Facebook data center is under construction in Eagle Mountain, Utah, U.S., May 14, 2019. Picture taken on May 14, 2019. REUTERS/George Frey/File photo Dealmakers expect 2025 to be a bumper year for mergers and acquisitions in the U.S. power industry, with a voracious appetite for assets as the sector gears up to meet massive demand growth from data centers for artificial intelligence. Record power demand and dizzying projections for electricity consumption for AI have made power generation and infrastructure assets, and companies which own them, attractive to energy companies, private equity and other institutional investors. The biggest growth in the sector in generations has already fueled a deal bonanza in the first months of the year, according to a dozen industry and financial sources who spoke to Reuters. The sources included several attendees at the annual CERAWeek energy conference in Houston. In January and February, there were 27 U.S. power deals worth a combined $36.4 billion, headlined by Constellation Energy's $16.4 billion acquisition of Calpine. This surpasses, both by value and volume, the first two months of every year barring one during the last 20 years, according to data from LSEG. Busy power sector deal-making is in contrast to the overall market for M&A, which recorded its weakest start since the global financial crisis, amid market volatility and uncertainty over the Trump administration's policies and what they mean for the economy. U.S. President Donald Trump has declared an energy emergency to facilitate the build out in the power sector, calling it "an immediate and pressing priority for the protection of the United States' national and economic security." Opportunities are significant and stretch across the power sector, said Kathleen Lawler, managing director at investment firm KKR. "I don't think we have ever been busier," said Lawler. KKR and Canadian pension fund PSP Investments agreed in January to buy a 20 per cent stake in some of American Electric Power's transmission network for $2.8 billion. DEMAND Strong price increases have boosted power companies' shares, meaning they can do bigger transactions or give up less of the company to clinch a stock-fueled deal. Even with stock market falls in recent days, independent power producers Vistra, Constellation and NRG Energy are trading between 82 per cent and 220 per cent higher than the start of 2024. Potential acquirers may be emboldened too by the reaction of Constellation investors to the Calpine deal. Constellation's share price rallied 25 per cent on the day of the announcement - when typically buyers trade lower when announcing a large deal funded by the issuance of shares to the seller. That is because the share issuance dilutes existing shareholder positions. Private equity firms, pension and infrastructure funds have in recent years raised huge sums for energy investments. The total capital raised but still waiting to be deployed, known as dry powder, into infrastructure investments at the end of 2024 was $334 billion, according to data provider Preqin. Ways this cash could be invested include buying stakes in companies pioneering developing technology, and acquiring businesses that service existing energy infrastructure. David Foley, global head of Blackstone Energy Transition Partners, told a panel discussion at CERAWeek the booming power market has created "opportunities for investment in equipment manufacturing, the picks-and-shovels types of companies." It could also be used to take listed power companies private. The year has already seen Altus Power, one of the largest owners of U.S. commercial-scale solar plants, agree a $2.2 billion sale to TPG's climate investment arm. Reasons to go private differ, depending on the type of power company. Smaller utilities may struggle to compete for contracts with technology companies building and operating data centers, so being owned by a large investment firm could help challenge larger peers. Long-term institutional investors could offer higher valuations than public markets, especially for renewable power companies. These firms have seen their share prices slump since the election of Trump, who has called for fossil fuels to be prioritized at the expense of green energy. "The market could see more (utility) take-privates over the next few years as there is significant infrastructure capital that has been formed in recent years that is highly focused on this asset class," said Greg Hort, managing director at Lazard. Another source of deal flow will be utilities continuing to offload business units, or stakes in them, to help fund huge expansion of power infrastructure to support heightened demand, the people said. On top of the AEP deal with KKR and PSP, Eversource Energy said January 27 it had agreed to divest its Aquarion Water unit for $2.4 billion, and National Grid announced on February 24 it would offload its U.S. renewables business to Brookfield Asset Management. The deal fervor is also allowing buyout firms who own power assets to exit profitably. This includes small portfolios of power generation, or individual power plants, which in recent years saw limited buyer attention due to their size. Particularly sought-after are natural gas plants constructed in the last decade, which are more efficient and were built when U.S. power demand was in its 20-year plateau. Relative scarcity was part of the rationale behind the purchase in January by Blackstone's energy transition arm of Potomac Energy Center from Ares Management. "Many private equity firms, which took ownership of their assets three to five years ago, will be seeking liquidity events," said Hill Vaden, executive director of energy capital insights at S&P Global. OVERCOMING HURDLES The momentum behind power dealmaking will endure despite market ructions, as the uncertainty only makes existing assets more prized, the sources said. While Trump's economic agenda is expected to make it easier for energy projects to secure necessary permits, key components are still hard to source, with the wait for turbines for a natural gas power plant stretching out towards the end of the decade. The president's tariffs on materials critical to the power sector will likely push up costs. This includes steel and aluminum, and potentially copper, whose conductivity makes it essential in a host of products. Uncertainty around whether tax credits for renewable projects, including those introduced in the Inflation Reduction Act, will be scrapped is also casting a shadow on new clean energy generation. Reverberations from immigration reform, which threatens to deport millions of non-citizens, will also weigh on constructing new projects. "I've even told members of the Trump team that we're going to run out of electricians as we build out data centers," BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said at the CERAWeek conference, when asked about the impact of deportations on the U.S. economy.

Title: Major Bank Trade Group Announces DEI Award Despite Trump's Executive Order

The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA) just announced its 2025 “Diversity, Equity, & Inclusion (DEI) Advocate Award” despite several major members of the trade group winding down their DEI programs after President Donald Trump’s executive order to restore “merit-based opportunity.” SIFMA, the preeminent U.S. trade group for securities firms, banks, and asset management companies, revealed the winner of their annual DEI award on Tuesday to be the DEI chief of Washington, DC law firm WilmerHale, Yoon-Young Lee. Notable members of SIFMA include Bank of America, BlackRock, Capital One, Citigroup, Deloitte, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan, and Wells Fargo — most of which have all but abandoned their prior DEI goals since Trump’s return to office. The president’s January 21 executive order, titled “Ending Illegal Discrimination And Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity,” prohibits private companies, including financial institutions, from conducting any DEI employment programs for jobs funded by federal contracts. A late February Bloomberg report revealed major changes coming to Bank of America (BoA), with a source saying the North Carolina-based company will no longer have “aspirational” DEI goals. An annual report released that week by the bank replaced numerous references to “diversity” and “equity,” switching out the words with “talent” and “opportunity.” “We evaluate and adjust our programs in light of new laws, court decisions and, more recently, executive orders from the new administration,” a BoA spokesperson said in a statement to the outlet. “Our goal has been and continues to be to make opportunities available for all of our clients, shareholders, teammates, and the communities we serve.” BoA is also set to change the name of an internal “diversity and inclusion” human resources group to “opportunity and inclusion,” the source revealed. Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser told staffers around the same time that the company’s “Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion and Talent Management” team will be renamed to “Talent Management and Engagement,” and that the institution will end its diversity hiring goals, Bloomberg reported. A mid-February Wall Street Journal article also revealed that JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley were “removing or watering down” their DEI efforts, while Wells Fargo had begun reviewing its DEI language. The Wall Street Journal reported that BlackRock also recently removed references to DEI in its annual report — just three years after CEO Larry Fink said the company “must embed DEI into everything we do.” Deloitte employees working with U.S. government clients were instructed to remove gender pronoun identifiers from their email signatures and to roll back its DEI programs, but the London-based firm’s staff in the U.K. were told that diversity “remains a priority,” the Financial Times reported earlier last month. Goldman Sachs also dropped a diversity requirement for companies it takes public and slashed its DEI section from its latest annual filing, Reuters reported. CEO David Solomon said the changes were made to “reflect developments in the law in the U.S.” In Capital One’s case, the entire section labeled “Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging” in its 2024 annual filing was missing from the 2025 release, but the company still has its DEI webpage up. Despite Trump’s anti-DEI order, SIFMA’s website states that there is a “business case for DEI,” citing a study by McKinsey that found that “companies in the top quartile for gender diversity on their executive teams were 21 percent more likely to experience above-average profitability than companies in the fourth quartile” — though the trade group acknowledged that “correlation does not equal causation.” Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.

Title: Beware of Li Ka-shing’s Supersized Value Trap
URL: https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/beware-of-li-ka-shing-s-supersized-value-trap-11741807049528.html
Time Published: 2025-03-12T19:17:29Z
Full Content:
(Bloomberg Opinion) -- From Chinese tech stocks to European defense shares, President Donald Trump’s second term seems to be lifting the world’s biggest value traps. One of the most prominent and controversial is the holding company owned by Hong Kong’s richest man, Li Ka-shing. CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd. has agreed to sell most of its ports, including those near the Panama Canal and a larger unit that has operations across 23 countries, to a consortium led by New York-based BlackRock Inc. It was a major victory for the US president, who had complained loudly that China had taken over the critical waterway. Market response was overwhelmingly positive. The $19 billion cash proceeds were about the same size as CK’s market cap before the deal was announced. That’s remarkable considering the entire port business, including in China and Hong Kong that were not sold as part of the deal, accounted for about 28% of the conglomerate’s operating free cash flow, according to the latest data available. CK’s stock rose 22% on the date the news came out, the most in over two decades. But as the initial excitement starts to fade, investors are growing nervous, wary of a billionaire family that has a poor track record on shareholders’ returns. The Li clan takes pride in the myriad of businesses and markets it operates in. But what kind of value-add can a diversified conglomerate offer when globalization is out of favor and geopolitical risks are on the rise? CK’s de-rating has accelerated since Trump’s first term, with the stock trading at just 35% of its book value even after the recent share bump. The complex business dealings have made enterprise valuation an impossible task. Apart from a 76% stake in CK Infrastructure Holdings Ltd., which has made 30 deals totaling $50 billion according to Bloomberg data, CK operates telecom assets across Europe, as well as 12 retail brands with more than 16,000 stores in 28 markets worldwide. The number of equity analysts that cover the holding company’s stock has dwindled to just seven, versus 17 a decade ago. In a sign of deep capital market skepticism, CK seems to have trouble monetizing its assets. Its health and beauty subsidiary A.S. Watson is still privately-held, a decade after postponing an ambitious $6 billion dual listing in Hong Kong and London. Softer consumer sentiment in China, once a growth market, has become a drag. Last summer, CK Infrastructure did a secondary listing in the UK, hoping to widen its investor base. Trading volume has hardly improved since. CK has not indicated how it plans to deploy the $19 billion from the port deal. In the past, the company did not announce special dividends or buybacks after major asset disposals, which would have pleased investors. Analysts say the proceeds could go into acquisition deals in infrastructure assets in the UK, considering CK Infrastructure’s recent interest in UK water supplier Thames Water Utilities Inc. as well as waste firm Viridor Ltd. Though nicknamed “Superman”, Li’s aura has long faded in some investing circles. In 2015, minority shareholders revolted and blocked a proposal by CK Infrastructure to buy out another subsidiary, Power Assets Holdings Ltd., in a rare setback to the tycoon who sought to consolidate his businesses before handing over control to his elder son Victor. This is the perhaps the last chance the 96-year-old will have to make amends with disgruntled shareholders. Instead of more empire-building, the Li family can perhaps share its winnings with outsiders. After all, stock buybacks are often the best use of corporate capital, especially when shares are trading below their fair value. That would be real superpower.

Title: A sprawling unit inside one of NYC’s first co-ops has listed for $34M — a discount from its previous purchase price
URL: https://nypost.com/2025/03/12/real-estate/a-unit-inside-one-of-nycs-first-co-ops-has-listed-for-34m/
Time Published: 2025-03-12T17:41:42Z
Full Content:
A rare half-floor corner home — and one located in one of New York City’s very first co-ops — has listed for $34 million. While $34 million for an apartment halfway up the 101 Central Park West cooperative — a structure in which residents own shares in the building, rather than the real property of the apartment itself — doesn’t sound like a steal, it’s still $1.33 million cheaper than what its current owner paid nearly 10 years ago. The current owner — whose identity is shielded by an LLC addressed to the 17th floor of Aby Rosen’s Seagram Building — appears ready to sell at a slight loss. They bought the sprawling apartment in 2016 for $35.33 million. The New York Times reported on the 2016 sale, identifying the previous owner as Keith Anderson, a co-founder of BlackRock and former chief investment officer to hedge fund billionaire George Soros. The sprawling unit takes up half of the ninth floor, spanning 7,000 square feet and 14 rooms. The listing includes five bedrooms total — not counting maid’s rooms — as well as five full bathrooms and two half baths. The home is full of luxurious touches, like two woodburning fireplaces and a Bulthaup chef’s kitchen. The previous owner also installed a high-tech system for lighting, sound and shades. The primary suite, in the north wing of the home, includes a home office, a dressing room with two walk-in closets and a powder room. But the real draw of this home is the view. Residents enjoy 100 feet of windows that boast unobstructed views of Central Park, according to the listing, and there’s a private wraparound terrace in the north wing for fresh air. Plenty of big names have called 101 Central Park West home, including actors Harrison Ford and Rick Moranis, as well as media heiress and equestrian Georgina Bloomberg, a daughter of Michael Bloomberg. The building is a considered a “white glove co-op,” where residents enjoy a 24-hour doorman and endure $18,436-a-month maintenance fees. The limestone and brick neo-renaissance style building was completed in 1930 by the renowned architects Simon Schwartz and Arthur Gross. The co-op is among several Central Park West apartments that welcomed Jews in the 1930s and 1940s, when they were excluded from other buildings on the East Side. The $34 million listing is held by Alexa Lambert, Victoria Shtainer and Marc Achilles of Compass. Advertisement

Ireland Under-20 head coach Neil Doak has made three changes and three positional switches to the run-on team that lost 22-12 to France for Friday night’s game against Italy at the Stadio Monigo di Comunale (7.45pm Irish time). Ciaran Mangan moves from the left wing to outside centre with UCC student Gene O’Leary Kareem heading in the opposite direction. The first of the changes is at scrumhalf where Queen’s University’s Clark Logan is once again back in the team, replacing Will Wootton. Chris O’Connor, who played for St Michael’s in the Leinster Schools Cup last year and is currently with the Terenure club, will win a first cap off the bench in backing up Logan. Up front, Henry Walker and Mikey Yarr swap roles once again with the former starting and the latter dropping to the bench. David Walsh, another ex-Michael’s pupil playing with Terenure, gets his first start of the campaign as he is named in the backrow in place of Bobby Power, who is named among the replacements. Michael Foy, outstanding in the defeat to France, will wear the number seven jersey for the first time having previously played blindside flanker in the other matches. Éanna McCarthy continues to captain the team from number eight. Paddy Moore, Tom McAllister, Conor Kennelly, Sam Wisniewski and Conor Fahey are once again named on the bench as Ireland look to avoid a fourth defeat in five matches. Italy are in the same boat as Ireland with just one win in the campaign to date, both having beaten Scotland. The home side lost 20-18 to Wales, 58-5 to France, both in Italy, while they went down 33-24 to England at the Rec last time out.

Title: Rice College Westport win FAI Senior Cup final defeating Blackrock College on penalties

A schools cup final that packed a season’s amount of incident and drama into the final hour of action culminated in Rice College being crowned the national senior champions for the first time in their history in Athlone. Backboned by the majority of the team that lost last year’s Junior (Tom Ticher) Cup final a year ago at the same venue, it looked for the opening 45 minutes as if Blackrock College’s superior physicality and power might give them the edge, even though that period passed by without either goalkeeper being seriously tested. The Westport side posed much more of a threat after the interval when they tried to work the ball into attacking areas much more methodically rather than looking to simply hit lone striker Jack O’Malley from 20 yards away or more, but Blackrock also found it easier to break through, with Jack Kelly testing Michael McDonnell from close range in the first minute. Harry Weir and Geordy Lavin down the left-hand side showed outstanding craft and ingenuity to open up the Rice defence on a couple of occasions, but the breakthrough never came, and instead it was Rían Durkan who broke the deadlock, coolly rolling the ball to the net after Jack O’Malley’s composure wrong-footed the Blackrock defence. That only served as the cue for Blackrock to step up the pressure, and when Cormac Sheahan headed the equaliser from Conor O’Neill’s corner, the South Dublin side and 2003 national champions had all the momentum. Nothing came of it however, meaning that the contest moved to overtime, when Durkan again gave Rice the lead when he slipped a low shot inside the near post with four minutes of overtime remaining. Those four minutes were as frantic as you’d imagine, with Rice College missing a chance to score while Ronan Ffrench was caught upfield, and that looked fatal when Lavin curled a free around the wall and into the bottom corner with the last kick. Penalties began, the drama continued. Evan Durkan set the tone by opening with a Panenka chip, McDonnell’s save on Lavin looked to give Rice College the upper hand, only for two saves from Ffrench to leave Peter Walsh with a kick to win it. A thunderous strike off the bottom of the crossbar, bouncing a yard out from the goal line, showed the wafer-thin margin between victory and defeat, all the more when captain Alex Halpin hit the top corner with the first sudden death kick and Jack Luff’s pulled effort wide of the post confirmed the Mayo school’s win. RICE COLLEGE: M McDonnell; E Moran (T McGeough FT), M Staunton, C McGing, S Casey; Jamie O’Malley (D Reynolds 56), K Conway (C Cannon 71, S Popov 104); A Halpin, E Durkan, R Durkan; Jack O’Malley. BLACKROCK COLLEGE: R Ffrench; D Noonan (R Dowling 84), J Luff, C Sheahan, H Weir; S Mooney, C O’Neill; C Hearty (J Gleeson Halpin 65), P Walsh, G Lavin; J Kelly (A Quinn 56). Referee: Jay Merriman.

Title: Blackrock Clinic Health Group given go-ahead for women’s health centre
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2025/03/12/blackrock-clinic-health-group-given-go-ahead-for-womens-health-centre/
Time Published: 2025-03-12T15:04:33Z
Full Content:
Plans by the Blackrock Clinic Health Group to establish a women’s health centre in Dublin city have been approved. Dublin City Council granted permission to the Larry Goodman Trust-owned Blackrock UC, saying the proposed facility at 2-5 Warrington Place “would not have an adverse impact on the surrounding area”. A six-page planner’s report found “the medical use proposed does not raise any concerns in terms of potential impact within the wider surrounding area”. Blackrock UC has said 50 jobs will be created by the women’s health centre which is expected to cater for an estimated 340 attendees per day. The planning application seeks a change of use of an office development to a centre it says “will be a pivotal step forward in enhancing women’s health services in Ireland”. A planning report lodged with the application said the facility aligns with priorities outlined in the Department of Health’s Women’s Health Action Plan 2024-25, which includes improved access to diagnostic imaging, ambulatory care, and preventive health services such as mammograms and Dexa scans. The report by McGill Planning stated “facilities such as consultant suites, physiotherapy rooms, and procedure areas directly contribute to key initiatives in the Action Plan, including the development of specialised gynaecology clinics, pelvic floor health, and multidisciplinary care”. In the report, Ms Shauna Hewitt said the repurposing of the existing office building would minimise environmental impact and align with sustainable practices, “an implicit priority in many governmental health strategies”. She added that “by addressing national healthcare priorities and fostering a patient-centred design, this transformation into a Women’s Health Centre is justified as both a practical and strategic advancement in healthcare infrastructure”. “The proposed Women’s Health Centre is a valuable addition to Dublin’s healthcare infrastructure, promoting equity, sustainability, and patient-centered care while contributing to the urban regeneration of this prominent location.” The report also stated that the proposed centre would be strategically located to integrate into Dublin’s existing network of women’s healthcare facilities.

ByRoomy Khan ByRoomy Khan , Contributor. human hand taking bitcoin from robotic hand Your money never sleeps. Before the world wakes, artificial intelligence (AI) driven systems are already scanning markets, seizing opportunities, and securing profits. This isn’t the future—it’s happening now. AI and blockchain—the twin engines of autonomous finance—aren’t just digitizing money; they’re rewiring finance itself. Blockchain is the trust engine, enforcing transparency and enabling atomic settlement—no middlemen required. AI is the intelligence engine, continuously learning, predicting, and executing trades in real time through autonomous agents. These agents optimize capital flows with unmatched speed, but their rapid evolution introduces structural risks—algorithmic instability, security vulnerabilities, regulatory blind spots, and the potential for cascading failures if safeguards aren’t in place. Retail investors now tap into hedge-fund-grade strategies—but they’re also vulnerable to flash crashes that can erase savings in an instant. The result? A financial system that never stops learning, adapting, and executing—reacting to market shifts at speeds no human can match. Finance's power dynamics are shifting as Wall Street titans and nimble disruptors leverage these technologies to gain an edge. Institutional investors deploy algorithms that execute optimum trades, while tech-first banks dramatically cut operational costs. Traditional wealth managers accustomed to relationship-driven finance must now adapt to a world where algorithms make split-second decisions. Trillion-Dollar Upheaval The financial services market is staggering: $100 trillion in asset management, $240 trillion in global payments, $200 trillion in banking, and trillions trading in repo markets daily. AI is surging toward $1.8 trillion, crypto is cementing its $2 trillion foothold, and tokenization is set to unlock $16 trillion in liquid assets by 2030. At this scale, efficiency gains—such as instant settlements and the removal of intermediaries—don’t just cut costs. They create new profit centers for incumbents and unlock high-value opportunities for investors and entrepreneurs, reshaping the financial landscape. For centuries, financial power was concentrated in the hands of a few—banks with rigid hours, brokers with steep fees, and investment firms with high barriers to entry. That dominance is fading. AI and blockchain aren’t just making finance faster; they’re making it accessible. Hedge fund-grade strategies, real-time insights, and automated portfolio management are no longer reserved for institutions. From fraud detection to high-speed execution, intelligent systems eliminate inefficiencies and redefine financial participation. The gates are no longer locked—anyone with an internet connection can enter. Industry Giants Are Paying Attention Traditional finance (TradFI) sees the shift—AI and blockchain are no longer experimental; they’re becoming the backbone of financial infrastructure. But adoption isn't instant. Financial institutions, entrenched in compliance and legacy systems, must tread carefully—yet they aren't sitting idle. They recognize the potential and are actively integrating AI's paradigm-shifting capabilities in advanced analytics and dramatic operational efficiency gains while methodically exploring blockchain for settlement and tokenization. Meanwhile, Silicon Valley's tech titans—Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, Google, OpenAI, and Nvidia—are unleashing powerful AI innovations, building the infrastructure they believe will underpin entire industries, finance included. With total investments approaching the trillion-dollar mark, these tech giants are betting big on AI's transformative potential across the entire economy. BlackRock, managing a jaw-dropping $10 trillion, sent shockwaves through Wall Street by launching its first tokenized fund on Ethereum. Suddenly, blockchain wasn't just for crypto diehards—it was institutional finance's next big move. Fidelity and Schwab are building institutional crypto custody and trading services. Meanwhile, crypto's early disruptors like Coinbase and Kraken have evolved into AI-powered financial powerhouses, integrating real-time fraud detection and high-speed execution that outpaces legacy markets. The Living Market: Finance's New Nervous System & Digital Workforce Together, AI and blockchain create an ecosystem where automation isn't just about speed but about trust, security, and predictive intelligence. A new financial nervous system is emerging—one that doesn't just automate but actively thinks, learns, and adapts. This evolving network integrates security, adaptability, and intelligence seamlessly. Blockchain serves as the backbone, while AI functions as the cognitive layer—transforming static rules into dynamic learning. This isn't just a faster version of today's financial systems; it's an entirely new species. Traditional finance relies on centralized controls and human intervention. This new ecosystem makes autonomous decisions, self-corrects vulnerabilities, and optimizes in real-time. The implications extend beyond efficiency—we're entering an era where capital moves with real-time intelligence, reacting instantly to opportunities and risks. This shift isn't about 24/7 markets—it's about superhuman markets. AI-driven trading reads millions of signals at once, hedges risks in milliseconds, and fine-tunes strategies faster than any human trader could dream of. Fintech world map The AI-Blockchain Nexus: Reshaping Financial Infrastructure The convergence of AI and blockchain isn’t just an incremental upgrade—it’s a fundamental shift in finance. At their intersection, these technologies unlock capabilities neither could achieve alone, reshaping trading, payments, security, and infrastructure. Trading & Investment PlatformsCoinbase and Kraken use machine learning to detect fraud in microseconds while analyzing complex market patterns beyond human capability. Fidelity is expanding institutional-grade custodial and trading services, while Charles Schwab’s blockchain-backed ETFs offer mainstream investors a gateway to digital assets. SoSoValue, an AI-powered trading platform, launched SSI on Base Chain, enabling users to hold algorithmically rebalanced crypto baskets, like on-chain ETFs. With 30M registered users and 1M DAUs in 2024, it hit $200M TVL within weeks of staking launch. Its top index tokens, MAG7.ssi and USSI (hedged MAG7.ssi for funding rate earning), rank among Uniswap Base’s top 5 liquidity pools. Payment & Settlement Systems AI-driven fraud detection and transaction optimization are transforming payments. PayPal’s AI systems have cut fraud rates by 30% while processing over $1.5 trillion annually—all without customers noticing. Stripe enhances payment routing with machine learning, reducing costs for merchants. Visa is piloting AI-powered cross-border settlements, while Ripple’s AI-enhanced payment systems analyze transactions in real-time, improving security and slashing settlement times. Security & Risk ManagementAave and Compound use AI-driven predictive models to dynamically adjust lending rates and mitigate liquidity risks. OKX integrates multi-party computation (MPC) wallets, reinforcing cryptographic security. Layer-2 networks like Polygon and Optimism are experimenting with AI-enhanced smart contract audits, minimizing vulnerabilities in decentralized applications. WhiteBIT is a thoroughly audited crypto exchange, with security certification (CCSS Level 3) and PCI DSS certification. Security measures include multi-user approval protocols, cold storage for 96% of funds, and advanced encryption for private keys. CER.live includes it among its top five exchanges for security. Through institutional partnerships and its Barcelona sponsorship, WhiteBIT continues advancing mainstream crypto adoption. Infrastructure & DevelopmentJPMorgan is deploying AI-driven analytics to optimize blockchain-based settlements, while Goldman Sachs is exploring AI applications in tokenized asset management. ConsenSys and Polygon are developing AI-enhanced smart contract infrastructure to improve governance efficiency and scalability in decentralized ecosystems. Meanwhile, Circle is embedding AI into compliance systems, simplifying regulatory processes for digital assets. ForU AI pioneers Real-World AI (RWAI), enabling users to create AI-DIDs and train autonomous AI Agents for on-chain economies. These agents, guided by goals, KPIs, and tokenized incentives, drive real economic activity while ensuring transparency and accountability. By merging AI with blockchain’s decentralized coordination, ForU AI is redefining automation—empowering communities to govern, build, and optimize shared financial and social ecosystems. The shift from human-managed finance to AI-powered financial ecosystems is no longer theoretical—it's already in motion. The future of finance isn’t just about speed—it’s about autonomy, adaptability, and continuous evolution. The AI-Blockchain Dilemma: Hype Meets Hard Reality AI and blockchain are rewriting finance, but they come with real risks. Regulators struggle to keep up with borderless AI-driven markets, where oversight gaps can allow hidden risks to pile up. Algorithmic volatility is another wild card—just look at the 2010 Flash Crash when high-frequency trading erased nearly $1 trillion in minutes. Regulators worldwide, from the SEC to the European Commission, are actively assessing how to oversee AI-driven markets, but no global framework yet exists. And while blockchain promises decentralization, AI’s massive computing demands could shift power to those with the biggest infrastructure, reinforcing financial gatekeeping instead of breaking it. The biggest unknown? Financial stability. Traditional markets have circuit breakers and central banks to stop crises from spiraling out of control—but in AI-powered, blockchain-driven finance, who steps in when things go wrong? These challenges aren’t theoretical—they’re already shaping global regulatory debates. The future of AI-driven finance depends on how we balance innovation and control. Your Place in the Financial Revolution Finance is at an inflection point, undergoing an infrastructure overhaul with profound, far-reaching effects. For centuries, financial expertise has been locked behind exclusive credentials and privileged access. AI and blockchain are dismantling these walls, making advanced financial tools available to everyone. Make no mistake: this isn't some distant future to contemplate—it's a financial tsunami already reshaping the shore. Finance is diverging: the old system, built for a slower, human-driven market, and the new frontier—optimized for instant, AI-powered decision-making. As you read this, billions are flowing through AI-driven systems—relentless, autonomous, and unstoppable. The tide is shifting. Ride the wave, or get left behind.

Title: Former Anheuser-Busch’s exec trashes Bud Light’s Dylan Mulvaney partnership: Not ‘authentic at all’
URL: https://nypost.com/2025/03/12/business/former-bud-light-executive-blames-dylan-mulvaney-dei-for-companys-downfall/
Time Published: 2025-03-12T14:07:47Z
Full Content:
A former Anheuser-Busch executive criticized the company’s decision to partner with Dylan Mulvaney, saying it wasn’t “authentic at all.” “The problem with the Bud Light-Dylan Mulvaney partnership was they just were not an authentic partnership at all,” Anson Frericks told Fox News Digital. “They were catering to a lot of those special interests.” Frericks began his career at Anheuser-Busch in 2011 and was with the company for over a decade. He told Fox News Digital he realized he needed to leave when DEI was preventing the brand from making what should have been no-brainer business decisions, like partnering with veteran-owned Black Rifle Coffee. “I joined a company that I thought was a great meritocracy, and then I saw the company really change, especially after 2020, 2021, when the DEI movement was really gaining steam,” Frericks said. The former executive left the company before the controversial 2023 partnership with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney. The ensuing backlash, which included Kid Rock shooting cases of Bud Light and posting it online, haunts the company to this day. Sales were down nearly 30% year over year in January 2025. Frericks said Bud Light was pressured by outside interest groups, like the Human Rights Campaign, to go more and more extreme with LGBTQ advocacy and ultimately wound up alienating its core customer base. “It was authentically a brand that was about sports and humor and bringing people together. It never got involved in really politicized issues… and Dylan Mulvaney was the face of a lot of these very polarizing topics.” Frericks said. Mulvaney, who appeared on “The View” Monday to promote her new book “Paper Doll: Notes from a Late Bloomer,” said she was shocked by the backlash. “Well, I will start by saying I love beer, and I always have,” Mulvaney said. “So, I mean, when I took that deal, I didn’t think anything of it, because I was, like, ‘Oh, this is perfect.’ It felt like an organic thing to do, and it was just another part of me… [but as the outcry continued to grow] I realized I had become the poster child for this thing.” Frericks, who went on to found Strive Asset Management with Vivek Ramaswamy, said that a convergence of outside factors pressured Bud Light into embracing an ever-increasing rubric of DEI policies that ultimately led to disaster for the business. He pointed to large asset managers like BlackRock pressuring companies to adopt environmental, social, and governance (ESG) and DEI policies because of the money they received from pension funds in progressive states like California and New York, as well as European markets. Last month, BlackRock leadership told employees the company was shifting away from its DEI policies. The former executive claimed Bud Light having a European owner, InBev, caused it to lose sight of the American values the brand had come to represent. In Frericks’ view, it is normal for business and government to collude to influence social outcomes in Europe, but that kind of partnership was antithetical to Bud Light’s business values and alienating to its customer base in the United States. “They abide by really different rules over in Europe. Europe is a very pro-ESG, pro-DEI continent,” he said. After the backlash from customers, Anheuser-Busch CEO Brendan Whitworth issued a statement that did not directly mention Budweiser’s partnership with Mulvaney and that critics panned as falling short of an apology. Still, Bud Light became the official beer of the UFC and enlisted comedian Shane Gillis to star in a well-received ad that aired during the Super Bowl. The ad, which featured Gillis and rapper Post Malone playing “Big Men on the Cul De Sac,” was praised by critics and fans. Frericks, however, says that for Bud Light to truly recover, a true apology is in order, and perhaps the company should even consider leaving its European parent company and finding an American owner. “I always say the path to redemption, it goes through forgiveness,” Frericks said. He added that Bud Light needs to admit they “screwed up” and ask customers for a “second chance.” Anheuser-Busch, Mulvaney, and BlackRock didn’t respond to requests for comment. Advertisement

Title: Crypto Bull Run Isn’t Over—It’s Just Changing, Says Analyst

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. In a period marked by extraordinary polarization, market participants find themselves torn between two opposing camps: one steadfastly predicting that the current dip is merely a setup for an impending altcoin rally, and the other resolute that the broader crypto bull run has already reached its conclusion. In a post on X, Koroush Khaneghah, Founder of Zero Complexity Trading, stated, “Right now is the most divided timeline I’ve ever seen. Bulls believe this is the last dip before an Altseason. Bears think bull run is over.” According to Khaneghah, “It’s becoming more challenging to ‘predict’ cycle stages as crypto matures.” He highlights developments that did not appear in previous cycles, including a shift from a traditional altseason to a memecoin season, Ethereum (ETH) still not breaking its all-time highs, and Bitcoin (BTC) surpassing its ATH and moving beyond $100K+ (an outcome absent in earlier cycles) 1. This Cycle Is Different From Others Khaneghah points to growing institutional involvement—an element noticeably absent in earlier bull markets. He cites data suggesting that BlackRock is currently holding nearly $52 billion worth of BTC (via Arkham). In his view, this significantly boosts the long-term buy pressure for Bitcoin, leading to potentially shallower pullbacks since “institutions will keep buying.” Because of heightened institutional interest, Khaneghah expects BTC dominance to continue rising. This dynamic could change how capital rotates into altcoins: “In this cycle, altcoins have seen Capital Dispersion. Meaning, more assets are in the market and liquidity is spread across multiple sectors, stopping any ONE sector from pumping hard.” He contrasts the memecoin market with DeFi. In the previous cycle, the memecoin market was roughly half the size of DeFi. In this cycle, memecoin market capitalization has equaled that of DeFi. If this scenario holds, Khaneghah believes BTC will remain the focal point for major moves while altcoins experience more fragmented, micro bull runs. “This means previous bull run playbooks won’t apply and you simply have to trade rotations,” he notes. 2. The Bull Run Is Not Over Khaneghah observes that BTC has only run 1.6x above the previous cycle highs before pulling back, calling it “not what a normal blow-off top/bubble looks like.” From a historical standpoint, BTC has frequently retraced by 40-50% from its ATH prior to surging higher. In the current cycle, BTC has only retraced about 26% from its peak, suggesting the possibility of more upside if past patterns repeat. A common bull-run trigger, according to many analysts, is ETH surpassing its prior cycle high—something yet to occur, given that ETH has not yet breached $4,000. Khaneghah posits that this lag might indicate a delayed altseason and a much longer overall cycle than expected. For altcoins to regain momentum, Khaneghah sees the ETH/BTC pair as a critical indicator. A bottom in ETH/BTC, combined with a rotation of capital from memecoins into other utility sectors such as DeFi and RWA (Real World Assets), could reignite altcoin rallies. Khaneghah concludes that traders need not be fixated on either the bull or bear side: “If you’re a trader, you don’t have to marry a bias or commit to scenario 1 or 2. If BTC dominance continues, trade BTC by longing strength and shorting weakness. -If alts start to bottom, shift capital there and buy the strongest coins.” At press time, BTC traded at $81,786.

Title: End of the road for EV battery maker that raised $15 billion from investors including Goldman Sachs and BlackRock

Northvolt, the electric vehicle battery maker founded by two former Tesla executives, has reached the end of the road after failing to secure additional funding. The Swedish company's board announced the bankruptcy on Wednesday, saying that it had "explored all available means to secure a viable financial and operational future." Northvolt said it faced multiple challenges in recent months that undermined its financial position, including growing capital costs and geopolitical instability, resulting in supply chain disruptions and fluctuating demand. Despite support from lenders and filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in November, the company failed to achieve the financial conditions required to continue operating. A Swedish court-appointed trustee is now set to oversee the sale of the business and its assets. "This is an incredibly difficult day for everyone at Northvolt," Northvolt's interim chair, Tom Johnstone, said in a statement. "We set out to build something groundbreaking — to drive real change in the battery, EV, and wider European industry and accelerate the transition to a green and sustainable future." Northvolt aimed to become Europe's main EV battery manufacturer and counter the dominance of Chinese rivals such as CATL and BYD. It was founded in 2016 by Peter Carlsson and Paolo Cerruti and had raised more than $15 billion from investors including Volkswagen, Goldman Sachs, BlackRock, Baillie Gifford, and Spotify cofounder Daniel Ek. Northvolt grappled with escalating debts, operational efficiencies, and a reliance on Chinese equipment that hindered its production capabilities. The bankruptcy affects Northvolt AB and its Swedish subsidiaries. Northvolt's German and North American businesses aren't filing for bankruptcy in their respective jurisdictions, though the court-appointed trustee and company lenders are set to determine their future. The collapse has come as European automakers struggle with weak demand for EVs and rising competition from Chinese rivals. Volkswagen, Europe's largest automaker, is considering closing factories in Germany for the first time and cutting tens of thousands of jobs because of weak EV demand and excess capacity. Last week, Mercedes-Benz announced staff buyouts and half-salary reductions to improve earnings following a decline in sales in 2024. Ford, meanwhile, said last November it would cut 4,000 jobs in Europe by the end of 2027. Jump to
