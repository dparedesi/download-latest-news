Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. Vulcan Steel sees green shoots emerging. Photo / NZME The reporting season gets under way in earnest next week, but results so far have given a glimpse as to what might lie ahead. Steel distributor Vulcan Steel is seen as a bellwether for the economy, and despite a first-half profit slump, the company’s share price has been on the up, post-result. Vulcan said Australia and New Zealand were at a turning point. It added trading volumes in New Zealand were anticipated to recover from the second or third quarter of this calendar year. Salt Funds managing director Matt Goodson said it’s not the first time Vulcan has cried “green shoots”. But going on the stronger share price, post result, it looked like the market believed it, he said. Goodson said the company’s exposure to the rural economy, particularly the strong dairy sector, made the “green shoots” story more credible. More light will be shed on the state of the economy next week when some of the market’s bigger companies report. “Everything we’ve seen sort of suggests the September quarter was the bottom. December was still a bit bumpy though,” Goodson said. “There are some signs of life, some not so good. Retail still looked a bit ugly in the December quarter. “It’s not so much the results themselves, but the strength and conviction around the forward statements.” Goodson said it would take until the second half of this year for the full impact of the Reserve Bank’s sharp rate cuts to take effect. “So that’s probably the single key thematic at the moment.” A2 Milk, which listed on the NZX back in 2004, is set to announce its first dividend at Monday’s first-half result. And with $968.9 million sitting in the bank (at last count) - why not? Last November, a2 Milk said its 2025 full-year revenue guidance was trading ahead of plan. Its previous guidance, issued in August, was for mid single-digit revenue growth in 2025 versus 2024. A2 Milk’s new dividend policy targets a payout ratio range of between 60% and 80% of normalised net profit. Aside from its dividend plans, a2 Milk has also raised the possibility of supply chain acquisitions or joint ventures to augment its Mataura Valley Milk facility in Southland. Forsyth Barr senior analyst Matt Montgomerie said he’s not expecting any surprises on Monday, relative to consensus expectations or the company’s own guidance. “This is a brave assertion to make given a2 Milk’s track record on result days, but the (still) pending supply chain acquisition/JV is the main area of possible surprise,” he said in a preview. He said the key focus areas were a2 Milk’s supply chain updates, China label infant formula revenue, and the English Label (EL) outlook in light of the new Genesis HMO product, a milk drink aimed at toddlers aged 1 year and over. The market consensus for Monday’s result is for half-year of revenue of $870.2m, up from $812.1m a year earlier, steady underlying Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation) at about $113.8m, up 2%, and a net profit of $77.7m, up 1%. The company’s first dividend is expected to be about 7c a share. For the big power generators, the second half of last year was fraught with challenges - a gas shortage, coupled with very low lake levels and light wind conditions - which saw wholesale prices go through the roof. This week, the big four power companies said they had teamed up to look at ways of extending the life of Genesis Energy’s coal and gas-fired Rankines at Huntly to improve security of supply. “I think it sort of really illustrates in New Zealand where it’s absolutely in the country’s interests that those turbines be refurbished and still be around come 2040,” Salt Funds' Goodson said. “Clearly, it’s going to need Commerce Commission authorisation to do so, so there is this really interesting tension between market efficiency and the best outcomes versus competition.” In terms of first-half results, Contact gets the ball rolling on Monday. At the end of this month, Mercury is expected to drop out of the influential MSCI Standard Index, to be supplanted by Contact. Big volumes of stock look likely to trade, courtesy of the influential passive funds, in the lead-up to the change. On the international scene, the big issue facing investors is what the US Federal Reserve does next after a surprisingly strong inflation outturn - 3% for the year to January - which drove US 10-year bond yields up by 10 basis points. The market had been pricing two more rate cuts this year from the Fed, but the data, which is yet to reflect the likely inflationary effect of new US tariffs, means people are beginning to question the likely track. The Reserve Bank of Australia is expected to cut its official rate, which has been at 4.35% since November 2023, on Tuesday with the Reserve Bank of NZ expected to cut its Official Cash Rate by half a percent the following day. If the differential between New Zealand and US rates widens, still more downward pressure is expected to mount on the already weak Kiwi dollar, which should provide still more impetus for local exporters. Craigs Investment Partners has downgraded its recommendation in view of Auckland International Airport to “underweight”. “With the share price up 15% since our last note, we have downgraded our rating from neutral to underweight. “We think AIA now looks expensive and in the short-term we think news flow will provide more downside risk for sentiment,” Craigs said. AIA is due to report its interim result on February 20. Meanwhile, the giant international fund BlackRock has raised its stake in AIA to 9.19% from 8.17%. Insurance company Tower this week told shareholders at its annual meeting that its strong first quarter reflected year-on-year improvements in business-as-usual (BAU) claims and management expense ratios. The company had previously updated its earnings guidance on underlying net profit after tax (underlying Npat) for the year ending September 30, 2025. Tower’s full-year underlying net profit forecast was revised upwards to a range of between $60m and $70m, from the previously advised range of $50m to $60m. Forsyth Barr said it was a robust first-quarter trading update, which included further detail on favourable BAU claims performance and solid customer growth. “We see the latter as the key positive takeaway from the annual meeting update,” the broker said. Tower shares last traded at about $1.46, having gained 123% over the past 12 months. Jamie Gray is an Auckland-based journalist, covering the financial markets and the primary sector.

Title: The Energy Transition Is Unstoppable—But Are We Moving Fast Enough?

This group brings together the best thinkers on energy and climate. Join us for smart, insightful posts and conversations about where the energy industry is and where it is going. Post Tom Raftery works at the intersection of technology and sustainability. Tom researches and advises companies on the clean energy transition. Tom also keynotes international events, chairs panels... Energy. The lifeblood of civilisation. The force that propels economies, lights up megacities, keeps your phone buzzing at 2 AM. And yet, the entire system—the backbone of modern life—is cracking, shifting, warping into something entirely new. Fossil fuels, the undisputed rulers of the past century, are on their way out. But are they leaving fast enough? That’s the billion, no, trillion-dollar question. I just sat down with Jarand Rystad, Founder and CEO of Rystad Energy, a guy who doesn’t just observe the global energy chessboard—he helps define the moves. We ripped into the hard questions: Is the energy transition accelerating at a breakneck pace, or are we still stuck in second gear? Are policy missteps slowing progress? And crucially, do we have a chance in hell of outrunning climate catastrophe? Spoiler alert: The energy revolution is in full swing. But momentum alone won’t save us. The stakes? Higher than ever. Wildfires torching landscapes. Supercharged storms rewriting coastlines. Energy markets seesawing in chaos. The transition isn’t some academic exercise—it’s the fulcrum upon which our collective future teeters. Why This Shift Is Unstoppable Conventional wisdom says the energy transition is a political affair—governments pushing green policies, activists waving placards. Nice story, but wrong. Economics is the real kingmaker. And the numbers? Staggering. ✔️ Solar & Wind: The Price Tag Tells the Story – Forget subsidies. Forget government mandates. In 2024, renewables are just…cheaper. Solar costs have imploded, free-falling by 81% between 2009-2019 and it has continued to fall precipitously year on year since (thanks, BloombergNEF). Wind isn’t far behind. This isn’t a “green” decision anymore. It’s a financial one. ✔️ Batteries: The Gamechanger That’s Already Here – Ten years ago, the idea of storing renewable power for later use felt like sci-fi. Now? Lithium-ion battery costs have nosedived by over 90% between 2010-2023 (IRENA says hello). Grid-scale storage is no longer theoretical—it’s happening. ✔️ Fossil Fuel Investing? A Sinking Ship – Once a safe bet, now a financial minefield. Oil and gas markets swing wildly, spooking investors—some of whom are doubling down on renewables, while others hesitate amid shifting political tides. BlackRock, Vanguard, and Wall Street’s biggest players had been making decisive moves into clean energy, but with the new U.S. administration recalibrating policies, some are slowing their green pivot, waiting to see how regulations shake out. Jarand Rystad put it plainly: If climate change weren’t even a thing, the energy transition would still be happening. It’s simple—clean tech is cheaper, faster, smarter. But don’t pop the champagne yet. The road ahead? Riddled with potholes. Three Colossal Roadblocks (And Why They Matter) 1️⃣ China: Renewable Powerhouse or Coal Addict? China is a paradox wrapped in a contradiction. In 2024 alone, they threw 357 GW of renewables onto the grid—more than the entire historical solar & wind capacity of the U.S. (around 310 GW, for context). But—and here’s the kicker—they’re still greenlighting new coal plants. Why? Two words: Energy security. No country wants rolling blackouts. The problem isn’t building renewables; it’s making them reliable. Storage, grid flexibility, and high-voltage transmission lines are the missing pieces. And until those systems scale up, coal remains the crutch. 2️⃣ Hydrogen & Carbon Capture: Savior or Overhyped Distraction? 🔹 Hydrogen sounds sexy, but let’s be real—it’s not powering your house or your EV. It’s expensive, inefficient, and, outside of industries like steel or aviation, it’s a square peg in a round hole. Electrification beats hydrogen in most scenarios. Every. Single. Time. 🔹 Carbon capture? More theory than practice. Sure, we can trap CO₂ from cement plants, but direct air capture is still a financial nightmare. Betting on carbon capture to save fossil fuels? Like trying to bail out a sinking ship with a leaky, cracked, coffee cup. 3️⃣ AI & Data Centres: The Hidden Energy Guzzler AI is rewriting industries, sure. But it’s also rewriting the global energy demand curve. By 2030, data centres could devour 8% of global electricity. That’s terrifying. The solution? Smart AI (hello DeepSeek, or similar) that uses very little electricity itself, and optimises power use, grids running on renewables, and better hardware efficiency. Otherwise, AI’s rapid rise could backfire, slamming the brakes on emissions reductions elsewhere. So What Needs to Happen—Yesterday? ✔️ Fossil Fuel Subsidies Need to Die – Governments are still dumping $7 trillion (yes, with a ‘T’) into fossil fuel subsidies (IMF stats). Imagine if even half of that went to renewables, storage, and transmission? Game over for coal and oil. ✔️ Investment Needs to Go Supersonic – We hit $1.8 trillion in clean energy investment in 2023. Sounds great? Not even close. The IEA says we need $4 trillion per year by 2030. That means doubling down—fast. ✔️ Grid Infrastructure Needs a Revolution – Renewables don’t work like fossil fuels. They’re intermittent, decentralised, and demand a smarter grid. We need better transmission lines (and optimized use of those lines), AI-driven power distribution, and massive battery deployments. This isn’t an option—it’s a requirement. The Verdict? We’re Winning, But Not Fast Enough Solar and wind are smashing fossil fuels on cost. China’s renewable buildout is staggering. Investors are funneling capital into clean energy like never before. But time is the one thing we don’t have. The 1.5°C climate goal? Almost out of reach. Global emissions? Still stubbornly high. And policy chaos? Threatens to slow everything down. The next 10 years are make-or-break. The choices made right now will determine whether we head towards a livable future—or lock in climate chaos for generations. Want the full deep dive? Listen to my full conversation with Jarand Rystad. What’s your take? Are we sprinting fast enough—or still crawling towards the finish line? Drop your thoughts in the comments. This post was first published on TomRaftery.com. Photo credit Wayne S. Grazio on Flickr If we had a time machine and could ensure that this rate of acceleration for clean energy happened 10 years earlier than it did, we might be in prime position. But given a lot of the intertia we felt, I agree that we're still lagging unfortunately behind Absolutely agree—if we had accelerated at this pace a decade earlier, we'd be in a far stronger position today. Unfortunately, inertia, policy delays, and legacy investments slowed progress. The key now is to avoid repeating those mistakes and scale even faster. That said, momentum is finally on renewables' side—costs have plummeted, investment is surging, and even historically slow-moving sectors like heavy industry are making shifts. The challenge? Ensuring that policy, infrastructure, and financing move at the same speed as technology. Do you think the current pace is enough to close the gap, or are we still underestimating the scale of change needed?

Title: Will Corporate Purpose Go The Way Of DEI?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/iese/2025/02/13/will-corporate-purpose-go-the-way-of-dei/
Time Published: 2025-02-13T15:55:40Z

A movement which gained momentum in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, corporate purpose speaks ... [+] to the very reason a company exists. With diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives under fire, will corporate purpose be next? U.S. President Donald Trump has ordered DEI initiatives be eliminated from government agencies and programs at a time when companies such as Boeing, Harley-Davidson, Target, Tractor Supply, Meta and Walmart, to name a few, are reassessing their commitments and values. If many companies appeared to embrace DEI – often under pressure and without deep conviction – following the death of George Floyd in 2020, that is changing now as societal and political winds shift to the right. How will this anti-DEI wave impact corporate purpose? In the face of backlash against DEI, is purpose at risk? Are we witnessing a return to profit maximization as the sole goal of business? Abandoning purpose would be a mistake. A movement which gained momentum in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, corporate purpose is complex and multifaceted. While many companies signed on to DEI policies and environmental initiatives as ways to "check the box" on purpose, it goes beyond these societal goals that are now so polarizing. Instead, purpose speaks to the very reason a company exists. Broadly, corporate purpose can be understood through two perspectives: an outside-in approach, which emphasizes responding to external societal and systemic challenges, and an inside-out approach, which focuses on how a company's internal values and member motivations shape its daily operations to serve customers. The outside-in approach positions corporate purpose as a tool to help address important global challenges such as climate change and social justice. But it can become coercive and thus politically charged. Since government policy is involved in these systemic challenges, private and political interests may come into play, creating potential for disagreement both within and outside organizations. A lesson from the current backlash is that in democratic societies, when the societal stakes for different purposes are high, it is important not to run too far ahead of the electorate and to engage instead in transparent deliberation with slow-moving dissenters. The inside-out approach views purpose as a powerful driver of passion and energy, aligning employees’ personal values with the organization’s overarching goals. For example, under Hubert Joly’s leadership, Best Buy’s purposeextended beyond selling products to improving customers’ lives through technology. A key advantage of the inside-out approach is its ability to foster unity, both within the organization and with external stakeholders, as it is freely chosen by all, and is less likely to spark disagreement. That unity and inspiration should in turn bring greater engagement and productivity. While an inside-out purpose for corporations has many advantages in driving engagement and internal cohesion, it is not easy to draw all the motivational strength from it so that it can be sustainable in an organization that expects also business results. That requires not only defining a purpose thoughtfully but also internalizing and implementing it effectively. Only in this way there is a chance of creating win-wins for shareholders and other stakeholders. Here’s how to begin: Corporate purpose may be understood through two approaches: outside-in and inside-out. It may be useful for business leaders to look at models of purpose-driven organizations, companies that are financially successful but that counteract the pressure of profit maximization as the default objective of the firm. In implementing purpose, head, heart and hands must be involved. ISS, a facility support services company, defines its purpose as “connecting people and places to make the world work better.” By framing their purpose as an enabler of better work and life experiences for people, ISS ensures it is both inspiring and strategically aligned with their business objectives, serving as a guiding principle for decision-making. Definining the purpose is the head part of purpose. ISS also engages the heart by fostering an emotional connection to the purpose; by, for example, creating a culture of appreciation, recognition and community through its "Thank You Way" initiative, in which managers and clients send periodic tokens of gratitude to employees. ISS also trains employees to view their roles as opportunities to create positive experiences for clients and end users, ensuring that their purpose is reflected in every task, from cleaning offices to managing facilities. By making purpose actionable - hands - ISS demonstrates that it isn’t just an abstract ideal but a practical framework guiding how they work every day. Three years ago BlackRock chairman and chief executive Larry Fink advised CEOs: “It is more important than ever that your company and its management be guided by its purpose.” Although Fink himself has weathered bruising criticism of his views on sustainable investing and stakeholder capitalism – while delivering record results for the asset manager – his words on corporate purpose still ring true.

According to the White House, Russia’s Vladimir Putin has agreed to meet with President Trump to negotiate ending the war in Ukraine. Trump opposed the United States’ financial involvement in the Russia-Ukraine war during his campaign, distinguishing himself from the Biden administration’s funding of Ukraine’s military. Trump’s Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth broke with years of U.S. foreign policy precedent in a recent statement asserting that Ukraine would not join NATO, a key provision for Putin. Trump has also been pushing for U.S. access to Ukraine’s mineral resources in any potential deal. We speak to The Nation’s Katrina vanden Heuvel about these latest developments. “There is an importance of what [Trump] is beginning to do, which is open up a process to end a war” that is “impoverishing Ukraine,” she says. “Both countries are war-weary” three years after the Russian invasion. NERMEEN SHAIKH: We begin today’s show with Russia and Ukraine. On Wednesday, President Trump spoke by phone with Russian President Vladimir Putin for 90 minutes about ending the war in Ukraine. Trump said they agreed to meet soon and immediately to begin negotiations to end the war. Trump then held a separate call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. After the swearing-in ceremony for the new director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, Trump spoke to reporters in the Oval Office. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I’ll be dealing with President Putin, largely on the phone, and we ultimately expect to meet. In fact, we expect that he’ll come here and I’ll go there, and we’re going to meet also probably in Saudi Arabia the first time. We’ll meet in Saudi Arabia, see if we can get something done. But we want to end that war. That war is a disaster. It’s a really bloody, horrible war. NERMEEN SHAIKH: President Trump also addressed questions from reporters about whether Ukraine was being sidelined. REPORTER 1: Are you freezing out President Zelensky of this process a bit? Isn’t there a danger of that? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No, I don’t think so, as long as he’s there, but, you know, at some point you’re going to have to have elections, too. You’re going to have to have an election. REPORTER 2: Putin says he wants security assurances, Mr. President. What does that look like? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: In terms of what? REPORTER 2: If the war were to end, he says he wants guarantees of security. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We’ll see what that means. We have — I think when the war ends, one thing he was very strong about, he wants — if it ends, he wants it to end. And that’s President Putin said that. He wants it to end. He doesn’t want to end it and then go back to fighting six months later. We talked about the possibility — I mentioned it — of a ceasefire so we can stop the killing. And I think we’ll probably end up at some point getting a ceasefire in the not-too-distant future. REPORTER 3: Do you view Ukraine as an equal member of the peace process? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Say it. What? REPORTER 3: Do you view Ukraine as an equal member of this peace process? PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Umm, it’s an interesting question. I think they have to make peace. Their people are being killed, and I think they have to make peace. NERMEEN SHAIKH: President Trump’s phone call with Putin came as U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth spoke at a NATO meeting in Brussels, where he said a return to Ukraine’s prewar borders is, quote, “unrealistic.” Hegseth also ruled out Ukraine’s future membership in NATO. DEFENSE SECRETARY PETE HEGSETH: As the war approaches its third anniversary, our message is clear: The bloodshed must stop, and this war must end. … We want, like you, a sovereign and prosperous Ukraine. But we must start by recognizing that returning to Ukraine’s pre-2014 borders is an unrealistic objective. Chasing this illusionary goal will only prolong the war and cause more suffering. … That said, the United States does not believe that NATO membership for Ukraine is a realistic outcome of a negotiated settlement. Instead, any security guarantee must be backed by capable European and non-European troops. If these troops are deployed as peacekeepers to Ukraine at any point, they should be deployed as part of a non-NATO mission. … To be clear, as part of any security guarantee, there will not be U.S. troops deployed to Ukraine. AMY GOODMAN: This comes as Germany and other European nations have rejected any peace talks with Moscow that do not include Kyiv. Meanwhile, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has traveled to Kyiv to discuss a Trump proposal for Ukraine to give the U.S. access to its natural resources in exchange for continued U.S. military assistance. According to the State Department, Trump’s envoy to Russia and Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, will travel to Germany and Ukraine in the coming days to, quote, “engage with allies and partners across Europe who are willing to work with the United States to end Russia’s war against Ukraine,” unquote. For more, we’re joined by Katrina vanden Heuvel, Russia expert and publisher of The Nation magazine. Massive developments in this last 24 hours, Katrina. Is this the beginning of the end of the war in Ukraine? And can you talk about the significance of Trump’s call, 90 minutes, with President Putin, his first, at least we know publicly, with him since he became president? Also spoke with Zelensky and says his first talks will be Russia and the United States in Saudi Arabia. KATRINA VANDEN HEUVEL: This is a monumental shift, Amy, for the — let’s begin with the fact that Russia launched this war of aggression. But from there on, this is a monumental shift, that, for example, the U.S. is not going to back Ukraine going into NATO. I think the defense secretary saying that has laid down a line that is in opposition to what we’ve seen for the last several — 17 years. That’s huge. I think the fact that the sides are talking is critical, because for too long it’s been a militarized relationship. It’s all been about Zelensky’s weapons and then the Russian weapons. Both countries are war-weary. The soldiers are demoralized. You’re entering a period of mud in coming out of the winter. I do think the key will be the security apparatus or the security framework that will be discussed. The Europeans — Macron the other day called for 150,000 security forces or peacekeeping forces. That seems very unrealistic. I think a lot will depend on what kind of security architecture emerges to keep Ukraine sovereign, free. There are elections that will be held, and that is mandated by the Ukrainian Constitution. And Zelensky has declared martial law. But in the end, what we’re witnessing is — and, listen, I mean, Trump — I don’t need to tell you how I feel about Trump, how The Nation feels about Trump, but there is an importance in what he is beginning to do, which is open up a process to end a war, to move toward ceasefire. And I think that is to be welcomed, because the war is impoverishing Ukraine. The question also will be, with a country, Ukraine, that has some of the vast reserves of titanium and uranium, how those will be allocated to reconstruct a ravaged country, Ukraine, what role Russia will play. There are many, many questions. But the important thing is to get to a table — round, square, oval — and to begin to discuss, talk, talk, talk, jaw, jaw, jaw. NERMEEN SHAIKH: And, Katrina, if you could say — you know, these comments that Hegseth made and that Trump has reiterated, namely that — as you mentioned, that NATO membership for Ukraine is ruled out, also that a return to pre-2014 borders is not realistic — so, insofar as what we know of Ukraine’s demands, is there any likelihood within the negotiations, given what’s already been said, that concessions can be made? KATRINA VANDEN HEUVEL: Yeah, I mean, I think the membership in the EU, which triggered this crisis in 2014, could be put back on the table. That’s one element. I do think that the reconstruction, the role Russia may play in helping fund reconstruction, is something important. I do think that Crimea and elements of the Donbas region may be put sort of de jure free, but possibly also negotiated into. That’s very tricky, the border there, the contact line. We may see a kind of armistice situation that we saw after the Korean War, so it’s left there. The trick is not to leave situations on the ground that can trigger, retrigger conflict. The NATO issue, I think, is critical, because I don’t know if people know, but it is basically a military-industrial complex lobbying operation. Members of NATO have to buy U.S. weapons. There’s an interoperability clause. In the same way, these security conferences that Hegseth is at or was going to, these are military-industrial complex lobbying parties. So, again, I come back to the fact, as much as can be demilitarized in the future regarding the security architecture of Ukraine will be helpful and important for the future of the region. I know there’s a narrative that, if let alone, Russia will go into the Baltics, will ravage Europe. Russia could barely beat Ukraine, a small country. It’s an anguish and horrible to watch what’s happened, launched by Russia. We’re three years on the anniversary. But the ability to talk and find a resolution, I think, can mitigate some of the fears of countries, which really have played a role in the debate to the exclusion of those who argue that Russia is not an expansionist power. I know that will lead many to shriek, but it can barely take on Ukraine. It can’t pay the pensions of thousands of people in other countries. NERMEEN SHAIKH: Well, absolutely, Katrina, but how, then, would you imagine that Russia could play a role somehow in the reconstruction of Ukraine, given its circumstances? KATRINA VANDEN HEUVEL: Well, there is a term that we’ve all learned in the last weeks: “oligarchs.” I mean, you know, there’s a lot of money in Russia that could be used. But the extractive foreign policy of Donald Trump is well suited for this moment, because, again, the minerals, which Mr. Zelensky has offered as part of a reconstruction effort. They’ve already had — Penny Pritzker was the reconstruction czar — Governor Pritzker’s sister — and she brought in Blackstone, BlackRock, our oligarchs, to help fund the reconstruction. The World Bank estimates it’s going to be at least a trillion. And we know what happens when countries walk away. We’ve walked away from Afghanistan. We walked away from other countries. So, I think there’s a moral and political and security need to find resources for reconstruction. AMY GOODMAN: Can you comment on the prisoner exchange, the teacher, Fogel, American teacher, after three-and-a-half years in prison in Russia, being returned in exchange for Alexander Vinnik, a cryptocurrency guy who was convicted? He’s going back to Russia. And then you’ve got Belarus involved with three prisoners released, one of them American, one of them working for an American media outlet, and also the sort of passing references to Saudi Arabia being involved with that, not to mention it being the place where Trump will meet with Putin for the first part of the negotiation with — over the ending of the war in Ukraine, though European countries are saying they wouldn’t negotiate unless Ukraine was involved from the beginning. KATRINA VANDEN HEUVEL: So, the first question, Amy, this is classic Cold War tit for tat. It’s like the film, Bridge of Spies. I mean, exchange of prisoners has been a longtime scenario. We’ve seen it. And, you know, what also happens, seriously, is obviously the repression of journalists, the arrest of journalists, the foreign agent. All of this — war is not good for progressive, dissenting people. I mean, it used to be said you went on — you became a dissident when you went on pension, but I think the dissenting community of Russia has been suppressed, not simply by the war, but by Putin’s politics. Saudi Arabia — I gasped when I heard that they might meet in Saudi Arabia, the home of the oligarchical vision. I suspect they’ll do Moscow-Washington in the end. But, you know, it reminds of how this war could have been averted. It could have been ended in March, April 2022, when there were substantive discussions in Istanbul. And there has been denial, but there’s also been acknowledgment that Victoria Nuland, who was in the State Department — the State Department — and Boris Johnson, who’s Boris Johnson, came in and upended it, sabotaged the possibility back then. So they should take that to their grave. AMY GOODMAN: Katrina vanden Heuvel, we thank you so much for being with us, publisher of The Nation magazine. KATRINA VANDEN HEUVEL: Thank you. AMY GOODMAN: Next up, “Elon Musk’s Business Empire Scores Benefits Under Trump Shake-Up.” We’ll speak with three-time Pulitzer Prize-winning New York Times reporter Eric Lipton about the billions Musk has to gain as he fires thousands and slashes the federal budget.

Title: Tokenization Platform Midas Introduces Yield-Bearing Tokens Linked to DeFi Funds

Midas, a protocol for issuing yield-bearing tokens backed by U.S. Treasuries and other assets, has introduced Liquid Yield Tokens (LYT) linked to actively managed, decentralized finance (DeFi) funds, starting out with Edge Capital, RE7 Capital, and MEV Capital. Late last year, Midas received regulatory approval to issue its basis trade and U.S. Treasuries tokens in Liechtenstein, allowing passporting across Germany and Europe. Tokenization builders in the crypto native and DeFi-focused arena saw the need for yield-bearing alternatives to established stablecoins like Tether's USDT and Circle's USDC, which keep the interest generated from reserves. Additions to the Midas product suite reflect changing market conditions. For instance, the firm’s tokenized T-Bill product, based on a BlackRock money-market fund, was introduced when interest rates were around 5% and DeFi markets were much lower, at around 2%. The later addition of a cash and carry trade token delivered yields last year of over 20%, however market trends are reversing, said Midas CEO Dennis Dinkelmeyer. The new LYT product aims at yields as high as 20%, he said. “We've partnered up with the best in the industry such as Edge Capital, RE7 Capital and MEV Capital with more great names coming soon,” Dinkelmeyer said in an interview. “These fund managers are really experts when it comes to yield, whether with T-Bills, basis trades, or other yield sources like market making and arbitrage.” The Midas tokenization platform allows a wide audience exposure to these tokens with a one-click issue and redeem process, Dinkelmeyer said. “In addition, the tokens can be used as collateral in DeFi, starting with Euler and Morpho with more to follow.” Ian Allison is a senior reporter at CoinDesk, focused on institutional and enterprise adoption of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology.

02/14 update below. This post was originally published on February 13 Bitcoin and ethereum have diverged in recent months, with the bitcoin price soaring as ethereum struggles—helped by U.S. president Donald Trump’s predicted plans for bitcoin. Unlock over $3,000 in NFT, web3 and crypto perks — Apply now! The bitcoin price is hovering just under $100,000 per bitcoin after coming within touching distance of $110,000 around mid January while ethereum has fallen sharply from its recent December peak as “dangerous” bubble fears emerge. Now, as a Coinbase executive claims Satoshi Nakamoto’s identity may already be known, Wall Street giant Goldman Sachs has quietly confirmed its bought around $2 billion of bitcoin and ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run Wall Street giant Goldman Sachs has bought $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin and ethereum ... [+] exchange-traded fund (ETF) shares as the bitcoin price surges. Goldman Sachs loaded up on bitcoin and ethereum ETFs in the fourth quarter, increasing its ethereum ETF holdings by 2,000% and growing its bitcoin ETF holding to over $1.5 billion, according to a regulatory filing. The funds bought by Goldman Sachs included BlackRock’s bitcoin and etheruem ETFs, as well as funds controlled by Fidelity and Grayscale. 02/14 update: Crypto prices have climbed over the last 24 hours, with small gains for bitcoin and ethereum being dwarfed by Ripple’s XRP, which has surged 10% after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) acknowledged filings from crypto asset manager Grayscale to list spot XRP and the memecoin dogecoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). “While this doesn’t guarantee approval, it begins a process for public feedback,” analysts with Tagus Capital wrote in an emailed note. “Grayscale’s XRP ETF, filed in January and amended in February, is now under review with up to a 240-day approval period. The SEC's acknowledgment is seen as a positive shift from its previous stance, as it shows openness to these products.” The race for the next U.S. spot crypto ETF is now between bitcoin offshoot litecoin, ethereum rival solana, XRP and dogecoin, with Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas predicting earlier this month that XRP and dogecoin ETF bids have a 65% and 75% chance of being approved before the end of 2025. BlackRock led a campaign to get a spot bitcoin ETF approved in the U.S. through 2023, with a fleet of bitcoin funds making their debut in January 2024 before surging to become some of the fastest growing ETFs of all time. U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs broke $100 billion in net assets for the first time in November, led by BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) which now has just over $60 billion in assets under management. However, the importance of Goldman’s bet on bitcoin and ethereum via ETFs has been played down one analyst. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has rocketed over the last year, helped by Wall Street adoption and Donald Trump's ... [+] embrace of bitcoin, ethereum and crypto. “This position by Goldman Sachs, similar to many other banks and hedge funds, is not a net long position,” said Coindesk senior analyst James Van Straten. "This is a strategy that reflects the basis trade, also known as the cash and carry trade, balancing potential profits and risks for bitcoin price fluctuations. The ETFs recently had options approved on them so this is most likely directional hedging." Last month, BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink revealed he’s had discussions with sovereign wealth funds about buying bitcoin and predicted such conversations could catapult the bitcoin price to $700,000 per bitcoin. "If everyone adopted that conversation, it would be $500,000, $600,000, $700,000 per bitcoin," Fink, who led the Wall Street rush into bitcoin and crypto last year via a fleet of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), told Bloomberg at the World Economic Forum in Davos.

Unlike traditional financial advisors, robo-advisors offer low-cost investment management with minimal fees, making them attractive to a broader audience. Their integration with digital platforms allows users to access automated financial planning anytime, enhancing convenience. AI-powered algorithms provide personalized investment strategies based on risk tolerance, financial goals, and market trends. Additionally, low entry barriers enable small investors to participate, further expanding the market. The growing demand for seamless, data-driven, and automated financial solutions continues to propel the adoption of robo-advisory services globally. Restraints: Limited Scope of Advice: The robo-advisory market faces several restraints despite its growing popularity. Limited scope of advice remains a major challenge, as most robo-advisors primarily focus on basic investment strategies like asset allocation and portfolio rebalancing. They often lack capabilities for complex financial planning, including estate management, tax optimization, and tailored retirement strategies. Additionally, regulatory challenges, data security concerns, and the need for human financial expertise further hinder adoption. Many investors, especially high-net-worth individuals, prefer hybrid models that combine automation with human advisors. Opportunity: Growing Demand for Digital Solutions: The robo-advisory sector offers a large opportunity as digital uptake in financial services speeds up. As the demand for affordable, automated investment options rises, robo-advisors provide tailored portfolio management while requiring little human involvement. The emergence of AI, big data, and machine learning improves their capacity to deliver real-time insights and manage risks. Younger investors, particularly millennials and Gen Z, favor digital-first financial options, fueling market growth.

"Research made simple and affordable – Trusted Research Tailored just for you – IMR Knowledge Cluster" https://www.imrknowledgecluster.com/ Challenge: Competition and Profitability: The robo-advisory sector experiences significant rivalry due to the influx of traditional financial entities and fintech newcomers. Companies need to distinguish their products to draw in and keep customers, which frequently results in reduced fees that compress profit margins. Elevated customer acquisition expenses additionally hinder profitability, since building trust in automated financial guidance requires time. Moreover, adhering to regulations introduces challenges and costs, especially with changing financial legislation. Maintaining technology and fostering ongoing innovation demand considerable investment, underscoring the importance of scalability. Key Players to Watch: Recent Development In January 2025, Futu Holdings Limited, a leader in digital brokerage and wealth management, launched ETF-based intelligent robo-advisory services in collaboration with BlackRock. Introduced in Hong Kong and Singapore in September 2024, this service aimed to optimize investment solutions for clients. Partnering with BlackRock, Futu provided five flagship Target Allocation ETF Model Portfolios, leveraging iShares ETFs for diversified global exposure. In December 2024, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) acquired Japanese robo-advisory firm WealthNavi for approximately JPY 99.7 billion ($664 million). Founded in 2015, WealthNavi provided an automated asset management platform, handling over JPY 1.3 trillion. Its services included portfolio management, tax optimization, and rebalancing. In February, MUFG secured a 15% stake before launching a tender offer at JPY 1,950 per share, an 84% premium, to make WealthNavi a wholly-owned subsidiary.

Title: America's biggest companies are waging a stealth campaign to dismantle DEI
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/dei-policies-delete-trump-disney-general-motors-pepsi-diversity-target-2025-2
Time Published: 2025-02-13T09:17:01Z
Full Content:
How companies from Pepsi to Disney are quietly dismantling their diversity initiatives In 2020, it was all the rage for corporations to pledge their allegiance to diversity and inclusion. In 2025, it's very much in vogue to declare that they're no longer into that kind of stuff. Companies such as Target, Walmart, McDonald's, Google, and Meta have recently announced major rollbacks of their DEI efforts. In corporate America, nixing employee resource groups is the new version of posting that Black Lives Matter black square five years ago. On the flip side, companies including JPMorgan and Costco say they're sticking to their DEI guns despite the Trump-fueled headwinds. It's tempting to paint an us-versus-them — or them-versus-them — picture: the DEI backpedalers versus the DEI warriors. But there's a quieter and potentially larger group of businesses taking a different course: subtly burying DEI efforts. They're not putting out press releases or big memos saying they're axing programs aimed at hiring diverse candidates or tracking supplier demographics. Instead, they've taken a look at the legal, political, and cultural landscape and made the calculation that it's better to silently pull back on DEI-related language for now. "Many companies in America have always wanted to promote diversity in the workplace in a manner that's lawful, and that hasn't changed," said Rebecca Baker, a partner at the law firm Vinson & Elkins in its labor and employment group. "What has changed is there's a cloud of ambiguity as to what is lawful." Companies are hoping to fly under the anti-DEI crowd's radar at a moment when the movement feels more emboldened than ever. They're afraid to put a target on their backs, legal or otherwise. Despite some of the attention-grabbing headlines, this might be how DEI really dies — quietly, in the shadows. While several companies have made splashy announcements about their DEI plans, others have simply scrubbed mentions of them, including in their annual 10-K financial reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. For their latest filings, it appears that a lot of publicly traded companies did a CTRL+F+DELETE on "diversity." Legally, companies have to disclose some information about their workforces in their annual reports, such as how many people work for them, but they're not required to say anything about diversity and demographics. It had become popular over the past decade or so for companies to make such disclosures anyway, especially in the wake of George Floyd's murder in 2020. But that's shifted as companies have become increasingly worried about being viewed as "woke" or overly progressive. General Motors, for example, cut the DEI section of its annual report. In its 2023 report, the automaker said it aimed to be "the most inclusive company in the world" and touted its diverse board of directors and dozen employee resource groups. In its 2024 report, that section was gone. PepsiCo's latest filing scrapped a breakdown of its workforce demographics as well as a line about how it believed its "culture of diversity, equity and inclusion is a competitive advantage that fuels innovation, enhances our ability to attract and retain talent and strengthens our reputation." The soda maker did, however, retain a mention of pay equity. Disney shortened its DEI section, in part removing mentions of employee development programs and fellowships for underrepresented talent while adding a mention of Heroes Work Here, an initiative to hire and train US military veterans. Mondelez International scrapped its section dedicated to diversity and inclusion in its workforce. Philip Morris International significantly shortened what had previously been its DEI section, removing goals for gender and racial representation in its management and mention of employee resource groups. The section is now named "collaborative culture." Some firms are taking a subtler approach. Pinterest, for example, renamed the "inclusion and diversity" section of its report "inclusion and belonging." Chipotle swapped "diversity, equity & inclusion" for "culture and inclusivity," though it continues to include breakdowns of its workforce by gender, ethnicity, and race. The companies mentioned did not respond to a request for comment or declined to comment on the record, with the exception of Philip Morris, which said it valued its "global workforce" and was "focused on fostering a fair and collaborative workplace in an environment that provides opportunities to all employees for growth and professional development." "Prior to Trump taking office, there was already a lot of pressure on DEI," said Andrew Jones, a senior researcher at the Conference Board's ESG Center. "Lots of companies obviously realize that DEI became a very politically loaded term, controversial term, even a slightly toxic term in terms of the legal and political scrutiny." Last spring, a Wall Street Journal analysis found that dozens of companies were changing their DEI descriptions in their annual reports amid heightened legal and political scrutiny. A new analysis by NPR this year found that several companies were axing references to DEI altogether. Beyond the filings, data provided by AlphaSense, a financial information and insights company, indicates that mentions of DEI have sharply declined on earnings calls and in other public investor-related communications over the past couple of years. Businesses are increasingly hush-hush about anything that might even have a whiff of DEI, lest they poke the anti-woke bear and become the next Bud Light or worse. "If you're a CEO, you've got the general counsel in one ear saying you're going to get sued or you're going to use lose contracts," said Alison Taylor, an associate professor at New York University's Stern School of Business who wrote the book "Higher Ground: How Business Can Do the Right Thing in a Turbulent World." "And then you've got the public-affairs person in the other ear saying here's who's yelling at you on social media." Baker said companies were increasingly including mentions in their risk-factor disclosures of potential controversies around their employment practices and social initiatives. "So they're flagging that 'Hey, investors should understand that the DEI climate is in flux right now and we can't exactly predict what might happen. And some of our employment practices, although we believe they're fully legally compliant, may ultimately end up a target of litigation,'" she said. Corporate America was nervous before the election about the political tides turning, given the Supreme Court's 2023 ruling against affirmative action in college admissions and the growing influence of conservative activists such as Robby Starbuck. Now, Trump 2.0 has sent many of them into a silent panic mode. The president positioned himself as a fierce opponent of almost DEI, determined to root it out of the federal government and, if he can manage it, private industry. The crusade is clearly having a chilling effect across the business community. In an executive order signed on his first day in office, Trump set out to end what he called "radical and wasteful" DEI programs in the federal government. The next day, in a separate executive order, he revoked an order signed by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1965 that barred government contractors and subcontractors from engaging in employment discrimination. Many government contractors are public companies. But even for those that aren't, the order lays out steps for "encouraging the private sector to end illegal DEI discrimination and preferences." It instructs federal agencies to identify up to nine potential civil compliance investigations of private companies. In effect, they're hunting for lists of names to sue, and no one wants to be one of them. "There is a valid fear of companies having a target on their back based on how they outwardly promote DE&I," said Renai Rodney, a counsel in Ropes & Gray's litigation and enforcement practice group, "which is unfortunate, because while there's certain things in the executive order that companies should certainly be mindful of, the underlying law has not changed." The chaos and confusion is part of the point. The letter of the law isn't any different — it's always been illegal for companies to implement quotas or require a certain proportion of their workforce to be a specific race or gender. The law's interpretation and enforcement, however, have clearly undergone a reversal. Federal contractors run the risk of the Department of Justice going after them to assert that their DEI policies violated the False Claims Act, which prohibits contractors from defrauding the federal government. Major companies could be accused by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission of violating Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, and national origin. The law was meant to prevent businesses from declining to hire someone because they're part of a minority group; now it's being used against businesses by people who say they're being overlooked because they're in the majority. Jenny Yang, who served as an EEOC chair and commissioner from 2013 to 2018 and now heads the Urban Institute's Workplace Equity Initiative, said companies facing claims that they discriminated or used ill-defined "illegal DEI" practices may very well have a good case in court and win. But going to court costs money, and any battle is likely to draw attention, so they may be inclined to give up before there's even a fight. "A lot of this really does not have the law behind it, and it's not likely to survive a motion to dismiss," she said. "But companies don't want to spend the money even defending against the lawsuit, and they don't want the reputational harm, or they don't want their board to get upset." Employers may proactively examine programs they think could be subject to legal scrutiny, such as scholarships or fellowships aimed at underrepresented communities. "It may not actually make it to a legal decision, but they decide, well, we'll settle this by opening up that program to everyone and not just groups," Rodney said. "Those haven't been ruled unlawful, but companies are either deciding we don't want a bad decision on the books or we don't want to use resources to fight this, so we'll just change the terms of the program." It isn't just the federal government that companies have to worry about — conservative state authorities, legal groups, and individuals with big platforms are also freaking them out. In mid-2024, Missouri's attorney general sued IBM, alleging that it was using unlawful racial and gender quotas in employment. The Trump-aligned group America First Legal has filed several complaints, including against Southwest Airlines and American Airlines, over their DEI practices. Texas' attorney general, Ken Paxton, has told financial institutions such as BlackRock, Goldman Sachs, and Citigroup to watch it on DEI or face enforcement actions. A police pension fund in Florida is suing Target, saying it wasn't made aware of the risks of the retailer's DEI initiatives and potential backlash. "In terms of what's the actual legal risk, I think we're seeing it now morph into Title VII discrimination claims from individual employees, activism by Republican state attorneys general," Baker said. "Now we're waiting to see exactly what comes out of the president's executive order." Just because companies quietly disappear mentions of their DEI policies doesn't mean the work can't continue. They can practice without preaching, and many will. If one is to believe companies meant it when they said they cared about fostering diverse workplaces, then presumably none of that went away overnight. The issue is that, cynically, it's sometimes hard to believe these companies were that dedicated to the idea in the first place. "Many initiatives weren't always measurable," Jones said. "There were a lot of public commitments without really thinking through how they were measured and implemented." Corporate values often seem like a PR stunt — X supports the troops, Y wants to end racism — based on where companies calculate the "right" answer is at any given moment. What's "right" often means "whatever will generate the most cash for shareholders" or, increasingly, "what will keep us out of trouble." "They're governed by social media," Taylor said. "They're governed by who was last yelling at them." A few years ago, companies were worried about the progressive backlash. Now they're worried about the conservative one. To some extent, companies ended up in this spot by talking a big game and launching programs without thinking through what they were actually trying to accomplish. "They're making decisions out of fear, likely, but they know no matter what they do, there's going to be a percentage of the population that is upset with that decision," said Naomi Wheeless, the chief customer officer at Nextech Systems and a board member at Eventbrite. "So moving silently or slowly is the strategy that a lot of them are choosing." The strategy is not a foolproof one. Many activists and government officials are out for blood, and they're seeking to make some high-profile examples of big-name companies in order to put some anxiety in everyone else. Hiding doesn't mean you won't be found. What's more, the political winds can change, and if they do, companies may be faced with explaining their choices to a new set of constituents. Maybe next time they'll think about what they actually want to accomplish, business-wise, instead of just paying lip service to whoever's maddest at them on Twitter.

Title: Is Ethereum Undervalued? A Close Look at Realized Price and Institutional Activity

Ethereum price action amid the broader crypto market bearish sentiment over recent weeks hasn’t been any different from the performance recorded in the past months. Over this period, Ethereum’s price has struggled to gain significant upward momentum, remaining in a prolonged consolidation phase. Amid this, a recent analysis by CryptoQuant contributor MAC_D has shed light on Ethereum’s current state and factors that may influence its future price trajectory. The analysis notes that Ethereum’s “ultrasound money” narrative—an idea tied to its post-Merge deflationary tokenomics—has faced challenges. Total supply has reached record highs, and the staking ratio has decreased by 1% since November. However, despite these supply-side hurdles, several demand-side factors suggest Ethereum might be positioned for long-term growth. One other key insight from the analysis is that Ethereum appears undervalued based on its realized price. The realized price reflects the average acquisition cost of ETH holdings across all wallets, currently sitting at approximately $2,200. With the current market price around $2,600, the analyst calculates a market value to realized value (MVRV) ratio slightly above 1, indicating that ETH remains undervalued relative to historical norms. This level could act as a strong support base, potentially limiting further downside. Another factor supporting Ethereum’s potential upside is the behavior of long-term holders. The analysis highlights an increasing number of addresses that accumulate Ethereum without selling, akin to Bitcoin’s “permanent holders.” Although some larger investors have sold during recent downturns, their positions have been absorbed by these long-term holders, helping stabilize the market. This trend suggests that Ethereum’s investor base is maturing, with a growing segment committed to holding the asset through market volatility. Furthermore, the analyst points out that selling pressure in the futures market has eased. Data shows a notable reduction in market price trading volume on the sell side since Ethereum’s price near $4,000 in November last year. This decline in selling activity, even as prices fell, signals a relative influx of buying power, which could set the stage for a recovery if market conditions improve. Institutional participation is another encouraging factor. Major players, including BlackRock, Cumberland, and other prominent firms, have reportedly accumulated substantial amounts of ETH during the recent downturn. For example, BlackRock is said to have purchased over 100,000 ETH, valued at more than $270 million. Such significant institutional inflows not only boost demand but also lend credibility to Ethereum’s long-term investment thesis. Despite these positive indicators, the analysis acknowledges lingering challenges. The increase in total supply and the slight dip in the staking ratio could weigh on sentiment, particularly if macroeconomic conditions remain uncertain. Moreover, Ethereum’s price movement may remain constrained in the short term as the broader market digests ongoing economic shifts. However, the combination of undervaluation, strong long-term holder participation, reduced selling pressure, and institutional accumulation paints a more optimistic medium- to long-term outlook. While Ethereum may continue to trade sideways in the near term, the factors outlined in the analysis suggest that it could be well-positioned for growth once broader market conditions stabilize.

Meet Samuel Edyme, Nickname - HIM-buktu. A web3 content writer, journalist, and aspiring trader, Edyme is as versatile as they come. With a knack for words and a nose for trends, he has penned pieces for numerous industry player, including AMBCrypto, Blockchain.News, and Blockchain Reporter, among others. Edyme’s foray into the crypto universe is nothing short of cinematic. His journey began not with a triumphant investment, but with a scam. Yes, a Ponzi scheme that used crypto as payment roped him in. Rather than retreating, he emerged wiser and more determined, channeling his experience into over three years of insightful market analysis. Before becoming the voice of reason in the crypto space, Edyme was the quintessential crypto degen. He aped into anything that promised a quick buck, anything ape-able, learning the ropes the hard way. These hands-on experience through major market events—like the Terra Luna crash, the wave of bankruptcies in crypto firms, the notorious FTX collapse, and even CZ’s arrest—has honed his keen sense of market dynamics. When he isn’t crafting engaging crypto content, you’ll find Edyme backtesting charts, studying both forex and synthetic indices. His dedication to mastering the art of trading is as relentless as his pursuit of the next big story. Away from his screens, he can be found in the gym, airpods in, working out and listening to his favorite artist, NF. Or maybe he’s catching some Z’s or scrolling through Elon Musk’s very own X platform—(oops, another screen activity, my bad…) Well, being an introvert, Edyme thrives in the digital realm, preferring online interaction over offline encounters—(don’t judge, that’s just how he is built). His determination is quite unwavering to be honest, and he embodies the philosophy of continuous improvement, or “kaizen,” striving to be 1% better every day. His mantras, “God knows best” and “Everything is still on track,” reflect his resilient outlook and how he lives his life. In a nutshell, Samuel Edyme was born efficient, driven by ambition, and perhaps a touch fierce. He’s neither artistic nor unrealistic, and certainly not chauvinistic. Think of him as Bruce Willis in a train wreck—unflappable. Edyme is like trading in your car for a jet—bold. He’s the guy who’d ask his boss for a pay cut just to prove a point—(uhhh…). He is like watching your kid take his first steps. Imagine Bill Gates struggling with rent—okay, maybe that’s a stretch, but you get the idea, yeah. Unbelievable? Yes. Inconceivable? Perhaps. Edyme sees himself as a fairly reasonable guy, albeit a bit stubborn. Normal to you is not to him. He is not the one to take the easy road, and why would he? That’s just not the way he roll. He has these favorite lyrics from NF’s “Clouds” that resonate deeply with him: “What you think's probably unfeasible, I've done already a hundredfold.” PS—Edyme is HIM. HIM-buktu. Him-mulation. Him-Kardashian. Himon and Pumba. He even had his DNA tested, and guess what? He’s 100% Him-alayan. Screw it, he ate the opp. Disclaimer: The information found on NewsBTC is for educational purposes only.

Gould’s position would see him lead the regulator that monitors large national banks. The news was reported by Politico and Punchbowl News, citing a document sent to the Senate on Tuesday. Gould did not immediately respond to Decrypt’s request for him to confirm the reports. Gould is currently a partner at the Jones Day law firm, and apart from his previous role at Bitfury, he has also worked at BlackRock and as the senior deputy comptroller and chief counsel at the OCC, according to his LinkedIn page. Tech firm Bitfury produces Bitcoin mining equipment and describes itself as the world’s “full-service blockchain technology company.” The Trump Administration has selected a large number of tech and crypto-friendly individuals to regulate the financial space. On Tuesday, news dropped that former CFTC commissioner Brian Quintenz was nominated to rejoin the agency as its chief. Quintenz currently heads crypto policy at the crypto arm of venture capital giant Andreessen Horowitz, or a16z. President Donald Trump campaigned to help the digital asset and AI sector and received financial backing from bigwigs in both industries. Now, top regulators are expected to take a more friendly approach to both burgeoning industries. The Securities and Exchange Commission has even launched a crypto task force aimed at developing new regulation for the industry—and cleaning up the “mess” that the SEC created under President Joe Biden, as Commissioner Hester Peirce wrote last week.

Title: The New York Stock Exchange is coming to Texas

The Lone Star State is on track to become a business hub, rivaling the likes of Silicon Valley and Wall Street. The New York Stock Exchange announced Wednesday that it would be relocating its Chicago headquarters to Dallas. The fully electronic exchange will serve as a platform for companies to list and trade securities. "As the state with the largest number of NYSE listings, representing over $3.7 trillion in market value for our community, Texas is a market leader in fostering a pro-business atmosphere," NYSE Group president Lynn Martin said in a statement. The NYSE did not respond to Business Insider's request for comment. Over the past decade, hundreds of businesses, including Charles Schwab, Oracle, and HPE, have established a base in Texas, their leaders citing business-friendly taxes and regulations. Billionaire Elon Musk has added momentum to the migration. He moved Tesla's headquarters to Austin in 2021. In July, he announced that he would also move X and SpaceX to Texas, and said that other companies would follow suit. Texas is now home to more than 3.3 million startups and small businesses and 1 in 10 publicly traded companies in the US, according to a fact sheet from Texas governor Greg Abbott. At $2.6 trillion, it's the eighth largest economy in the world, surpassing countries like Russia, Canada and Italy. "Texas is the most powerful economy in the nation, and now we will become the financial capital of America," Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said in a statement on Wednesday. "With the launch of NYSE Texas, we will expand our financial might in the United States and cement our great state as an economic powerhouse on the global stage." The arrival of the centuries-old NYSE signals that Dallas may be emerging as the state's financial capital. In January, the Texas Stock Exchange — a smaller competitor backed by major financial institutions like BlackRock, Citadel Securities, Charles Schwab — announced that it had filed its Form 1 registration with the US Securities and Exchange Commission and was targeting a 2026 launch.

Title: Ethereum: 4 reasons why ETH has room for more growth

Time Published: 2025-02-12T23:30:28Z

Despite increased negative side factors, demand for Ethereum remains high and positions ETH for recovery. Since reaching $4.1k two months ago, Ethereum [ETH] has failed to maintain an upward momentum. Over this period, it has experienced extreme volatility, even dropping as low as $2.1k. These market conditions have awakened strong sentiments among crypto analysts, with some being optimistic while others are highly pessimistic. One of those who have shown high optimism despite the price struggle is CryptoQuant’s analyst Mac, who has pointed out that Ethereum still has room for growth. According to the CryptoQuant analyst, despite the prevailing negative supply side factors, Ethereum’s potential for upward growth remains significantly high. Source: CryptoQuant This upward potential can be seen through four major factors. First, Ethereum’s current realized price was around $2.2k at press time, which was considerably undervalued, compared to its price of $2.6k. 2.2k serves as a strong support level, as such, the circulating MVRV based on the realized price yields a value above 1. At this level, it indicates that ETH is highly undervalued. Second, Ethereum’s number of permanent holders who have accumulated Ethereum and never sold has experienced a sustained rise. While some whales may have closed their positions, permanent holders have absorbed this selling pressure. Source: CryptoQuant Third, Ethereum has seen the selling pressure in the futures market reduce. This indicates that although prices have declined, the selling pressure has also decreased, suggesting a relative inflow of buying power. Source: CryptoQuant Finally, institutional investors are aggressively accumulating Ethereum. When ETH’s price plunged, institutions turned to buy the dip. Thus, BlackRock bought 100.5k ETH worth $276 million, Cumberland ETH worth $174 million, and other institutions such as WLFI are actively buying. This buying pressure is key as it’s acting as a factor offsetting downward pressure. Therefore, although Ethereum is struggling to sustain gains, there are positive factors from the demand side. Notably, ETH was experiencing positive sentiment from the demand side. At press time, Ethereum’s Taker buy-sell ratio flipped positive to reach 1.05 after being negative for the past five days. This implies that buyers have reentered the market and are outweighing sellers. Source: CryptoQuant Additionally, Ethereum’s Fund market premium has flipped positive for the first time this week. When FMP turns positive, it suggests that investors are bullish and longs are paying shorts to hold their trade as they anticipate the market to rebound. Source: CryptoQuant Finally, Ethereum’s exchange reserve is at a yearly low, suggesting that investors are actively accumulating ETH. As such, more ETH is moving off exchanges, suggesting that investors are keeping their assets in cold storage. Source: CryptoQuant In conclusion, although Ethereum is struggling on the supply side, the demand is high. With a high demand, ETH could see the market strengthen to reclaim a higher resistance. Therefore, with the supply and demand sides still fighting for control, ETH will continue to trade sideways until the markets and macroeconomic conditions are strong enough for an uptrend.

President Donald Trump has nominated Jonathan McKernan as the director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), a major move in the administration’s broader government restructuring. The nomination has been sent to the Senate and is expected to be approved. McKernan, who previously served as a board member of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and senior counsel of policy at the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), announced his departure from the FDIC just a day before his nomination. If confirmed, he will rejoin the FDIC board in a secondary role. McKernan takes over the CFPB after a series of acting directors, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Director of the White House Office of Management and Budget Russell Vought. On Feb. 6, Vought was confirmed by the Senate to lead the Office of Management and Budget just three days after firing Biden-era CFPB Director Rohit Chopra. As acting director, Vought quickly moved to scale back CFPB operations, following Trump’s executive orders aimed at shrinking the federal government by: The National Treasury Employees Union, which represents CFPB employees, responded by filing two lawsuits against Vought on Feb. 9. One suit challenges Vought’s order to stop work, calling it “unlawful,” while the other argues that the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) should not have access to CFPB employee data, citing potential risks of misuse. Before McKernan’s nomination, he pushed for stronger oversight of large asset managers at the FDIC, arguing that their influence could distort bank management, according to Banking Dive. Though generally aligned with Republican priorities, he has backed bipartisan efforts to tighten regulations on firms such as Vanguard and BlackRock. His prior experience includes serving as a senior financial policy advisor for Sen. Bob Corker, former chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and holding counsel roles with the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs and the U.S. Treasury. According to the FDIC, McKernan also co-chaired a special committee that oversaw an independent review of workplace misconduct and issues with workplace culture from November 2023 to May 2024. Peter Idziak, a senior associate at mortgage law firm Polunsky Beitel Green, said many in the lending industry are hopeful that McKernan’s nomination signals that rather than shutting the CFPB down, the Trump administration intends to revisit policies and practices that have allegedly increased costs for consumers and stifled innovation. “Given McKernan’s policy expertise and significant tenure within government, his nomination may signal that the Trump Administration ultimately intends to reform the CFPB rather than ‘deleting’ it,” Idziak said, in a statement. The Trump administration “may have realized that simply hollowing out the Bureau would leave regulations crafted by the Biden administration in place to be enforced by states and the courts.” The CFPB polices illegal kickbacks in the real estate industry, in addition to protecting consumers from unfair, deceptive or abusive lending practices.

Investors are able to access FOBXX using Franklin Templeton’s Benji Investments mobile app, which serves as a digital wallet. First launched in 2021, FOBXX enables investors to gain exposure to U.S. government securities, cash, and repurchase agreements.

It faces stiff competition from BlackRock and its USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund, aka BUIDL, launched on Ethereum last spring. Among $3.6 billion in tokenized treasury products, BUIDL’s market cap has swelled to $637 million, muscling past BENJI’s total value last April, according to rwa.xyz data. Franklin Templeton’s decision to issue BENJI on Solana, however, places the product within one of crypto’s buzziest ecosystems for decentralized finance, or DeFi applications. BlackRock’s BUIDL has, so far, not been issued on the speedy layer-1 network. Though the metric is considered somewhat crude, Solana’s total value locked (TVL) has grown to $9 billion, making it the second most valuable DeFi ecosystem behind Ethereum’s $56 billion landscape (not including Ethereum scaling networks), according to DefiLlama data. Encompassing real-world assets like bonds, real estate, and gold, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink once dubbed tokenization the “next evolution of markets,” enabling near-instantaneous settlement and reduced fees. While tokenized markets are still in their infancy, British bank Standard Chartered projected last month the tokenization sector could grow to as much as $30 trillion by 2034. In November, BlackRock expanded BUIDL’s footprint to five new blockchains, issuing shares on Aptos, Avalanche, and the Ethereum scaling networks Arbitrum, Optimism, and Polygon. First available on Ethereum sidechain network Polygon and the layer-1 network Stellar, BENJI expanded to Ethereum last year, as well as Aptos, Avalanche, Arbitrum, and the Coinbase-launched Ethereum scaling network Base.

Title: Acting SEC Chair Says Climate-Related Disclosure Rule Is Illegal

FILE - The seal of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission at SEC headquarters, June 19, 2015, ... [+] in Washington.(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik, File) On March 6, 2024, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission adopted the Climate-Related Disclosure Rule. The final rule required large publicly traded companies to disclose climate action, greenhouse gas emissions, and the financial impacts of severe weather events. The rule was immediately met with legal challenges and was delayed while the court heard the cases. On February 11, acting SEC Chair Mark Uyeda began the process to permanently end the rule, leaving climate advocates and businesses that heavily invested in reporting reeling. Following the Paris Agreement in 2015, a series of global initiatives were pursued to reduce the impacts of climate change and reduce overall greenhouse gas emissions to “net zero” by 2050. The goal included a significant reduction in GHG emissions, but also utilized “offsets” that, through technology and protection of natural resources, would result in overall emissions being at a net of zero. This resulted in a carbon credit market that allowed high GHG emitting countries and businesses to purchase credits from underdeveloped countries that produce little emissions. On the financial side, a multi-prong approach was used to influence and regulate businesses. Large investment firms, like BlackRock, used their influence to drive ESG and sustainability. By 2021, it was standard practice for businesses to release annual ESG and sustainability reports. However, there was no standardization of the practice. Claims were unregulated and content was unclear. As a result, reports were focused on what the business thought mattered to investors and were little more than marketing pieces. This became problematic in the highly regulated financial industry. Funds that claim to be ESG, green, climate friendly, or sustainable must back up those claims with data. As a result of demand and Paris Agreement based initiatives, international regulators began drafting standards for reporting, marketing, and investments relating to climate change and other green initiatives. In 2021, the International Sustainability Standards Board drafted the International Financial Reporting Standards Foundation’s Sustainability Disclosure Standards. IFRS is an independent, nonprofit organization that develops financial reporting standards, including international accounting standards. IFRS is not used in the U.S., who uses generally accepted accounting principles, also known as GAAP, but is used in 132 jurisdictions. The IFRS Standards were adopted in June 2023 as the global standard for sustainability and climate change reporting, including greenhouse gas emissions. In the U.S., the SEC proposed the development of climate-related reporting standards in March 2022. The final rule, adopted on March 6, 2024, required large publicly traded companies to disclose climate action, GHG emissions, and the financial impacts of severe weather events. The Climate-Related Disclosure Rule was initially set to go into effect in 2026. However, it was immediately met with legal challenges and the SEC delayed implementation indefinitely while the cases worked through the judicial process. Now it appears the delay will become permanent. Under the leadership of Gary Gensler, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission saw a wave of regulatory and enforcement actions relating to environmental, social, and governance; sustainability; and climate change. It was clear that his exit, effective the day President Trump took office, would significantly alter the SEC’s approach to those topics. On February 11, acting SEC Chair Uyeda, a Biden appointee, effectively ended the Climate-Related Disclosure Rule. In the statement, Uyeda said, “The Rule is deeply flawed and could inflict significant harm on the capital markets and our economy.” “Both Commissioner Peirce and I voted against the Rule’s adoption. Commissioner Peirce said that then-existing disclosure rules were sufficient and that the ‘[R]ule’s anticipated benefits do not outweigh the costs.’ She argued that ‘only a mandate from Congress should put us in the business of facilitating the disclosure of information not clearly related to financial returns.’ I stated that the Commission was ‘without statutory authority or expertise’ to address climate change issues and that ’this [R]ule is climate regulation promulgated under the Commission’s seal.’” “The Commission’s briefs previously submitted in the cases consolidated in the Eighth Circuit do not reflect my views… I also question whether the agency followed the proper procedures under the Administrative Procedure Act to adopt the Rule.” As a result, Acting Chair Uyeda has asked the court for a delay in the proceedings while the SEC takes action to rollback the Climate-Related Disclosure Rule. As a result, climate reporting at the national level is effectively dead. The focus now turns to the states and international actions. One Community. Many Voices.

Title: NYSE Plans Texas Exchange as Financial Firms Flock to State

The New York Stock Exchange plans to start an equities exchange in Texas, the latest firm seeking a slice of the financial services industry in a state where the taxes are lower and regulation looser. NYSE said it will reincorporate its NYSE Chicago operations in Texas and will launch the fully electronic exchange in Dallas, pending regulatory filings. The exchange will serve companies from Texas and around the world, it said. NYSE’s move underscores the heightened allure of Texas for corporations and financial firms seeking to benefit from a more relaxed regulatory environment than blue states like New York and California. Dallas is host to the Texas Stock Exchange, which counts BlackRock Inc. and Citadel Securities among its backers and plans to begin trading in early 2026. Nasdaq last year reorganized its listings business into three regional divisions including Texas. “As the state with the largest number of NYSE listings, representing over $3.7 trillion in market value for our community, Texas is a market leader in fostering a pro-business atmosphere,” NYSE President Lynn Martin said in a statement. The NYSE’s plans give another boost to the Dallas-Fort Worth area, which already has more finance workers than Chicago or Los Angeles, trailing only New York. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is building a new campus in Dallas that will house about 5,000 employees. “With the launch of NYSE Texas, we will expand our financial might in the United States and cement our great state as an economic powerhouse on the global stage,” Texas Governor Greg Abbott said. Although the state is known for its business-friendly approach, the Texas Stock Exchange has faced some other challenges. It was already contending with an uphill climb to secure listings. Its promises to avoid what could be seen as political requirements, like board composition requirements, have lost punch as companies have begun rolling back diversity and environmental pledges. It would also need to bite off business from private equity. “They’re not only competing against the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq,” said Andrew Silverman, an analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence. “They’re also competing against Blackstone. They’re also competing against Apollo. They’re also competing against Berkshire Hathaway.” TXSE Group Inc., parent company of the proposed Texas Stock Exchange, recently closed its initial fundraising round at $161 million and said TXSE has filed for registration as a bourse with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. “We are committed to closely aligning with issuers and investors to provide a premier venue for listing and a world-class platform for trading,” a spokesperson for TXSE said in a statement. “We have known all along that Texas is the best place to do business.” NYSE and its biggest rival Nasdaq dominate the IPO market, which is rebounding after a lengthy slump on geopolitical uncertainty, inflation and higher interest rates. Nasdaq Chief Executive Officer Adena Friedman said last month she expects a strong environment for IPOs in the second quarter and rest of the year. NYSE’s move to Dallas is “going to bring more financial firms with it, and force Texas to reinforce its infrastructure,” said David Choate, chief operating officer of Dallas-based brokerage firm CAPIS. “You’re always wanting to be on the cutting edge of technology if you’re hosting financial firms like exchanges,” he said.

Title: NYSE comes to Dallas with rebranded branch as Texas Stock Exchange eyes launch

Business By Sasha RichieBreaking business reporter Breaking business reporter The New York Stock Exchange will reincorporate its Chicago branch in Texas, it announced on Wednesday, rebranding it as NYSE Texas and moving to Dallas. With the upstart Texas Stock Exchange taking shape and the Nasdaq expanding its reach in the Lone Star State, the Dallas region is about to find out if “Y’all Street” is big enough for three players. Timing of the Big Board’s “fully electronic” Texas equity market will depend on regulatory filings, the NYSE said. The announcement comes as a number of big companies flock to Texas as a whole, drawn in by its low taxes and business-friendly regulation. Become a business insider with the latest news. Or with: By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy “As the state with the largest number of NYSE listings, representing over $3.7 trillion in market value for our community, Texas is a market leader in fostering a pro-business atmosphere,” Lynn Martin, president of NYSE Group, said in a statement. “We are delighted to expand our presence in the Lone Star State, which plays a key role in driving our U.S. economy forward.” New York’s NYSE and Nasdaq have had a near duopoly on the U.S. securities market for decades, but both apparently see a formidable challenger in the Dallas-based upstart TXSE. The startup has gotten $161 million in initial backing from financial giants like BlackRock and Citadel Securities, and is on track for an early 2026 launch. Late last month, it filed for U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approval. The TXSE’s goal is to lower the costs of getting listed while also raising standards for who gets to be listed, in order to reincentivize companies to go public while taking advantage of Texas’ robust business community. “The Texas Stock Exchange is harnessing this momentum to build a national securities exchange in our home state. We are committed to closely aligning with issuers and investors to provide a premier venue for listing and a world-class platform for trading,” a spokesperson for TXSE said in a statement responding to NYSE’s announcement. “The mission of the Texas Stock Exchange is to bring competition back to the markets, and we look forward to cementing Dallas as one of the financial capitals of the world.” Recently, the Nasdaq announced a new regional management division based in nearby Irving, just months after TXSE founder and CEO James Lee announced he’d raised over $100 million in capital. “Texas is the most powerful economy in the nation, and now we will become the financial capital of America,” said Gov. Greg Abbott in a statement. “With the launch of NYSE Texas, we will expand our financial might in the United States and cement our great state as an economic powerhouse on the global stage.” Sasha is a business reporter for The Dallas Morning News.

Title: Ukraine regaining pre-2014 borders is 'unrealistic objective,' Hegseth says in first NATO visit

But we must start by recognizing that returning to Ukraine’s pre-2014 borders is an unrealistic objective. Chasing this illusionary goal will only prolong the war and cause more suffering." -snip- "A durable peace for Ukraine must include robust security guarantees to ensure that the war will not begin again," Hegseth said Wednesday. "The United States does not believe that NATO membership for Ukraine is a realistic outcome of a negotiated settlement. Instead, any security guarantee must be backed by capable European and non-European troops." "If these troops are deployed as peacekeepers to Ukraine at any point, they should be deployed as part of a non-NATO mission and not covered under Article 5. There also must be robust international oversight of the line of contact," he continued. "To be clear, as part of any security guarantee, there will not be U.S. troops deployed to Ukraine." -snip- Hegseth also said he is in Brussels today to "directly and unambiguously express that stark strategic realities prevent the United States from being primarily focused on the security of Europe." "The United States faces consequential threats to our homeland. We must -- and we are -- focusing on securing our own borders," he said. "We also face a peer competitor in China with the capability and intent to threaten our homeland and core national interests in the Indo-Pacific." (Excerpt) Read more at foxnews.com ...

Angela Merkel, who the US government campaigned covertly against and spied on, warned that driving Russia towards China was a bad idea. But that is exactly what ended up happening.

"We want a sovereign and prosperous Ukraine. But we must start by recognizing that returning to Ukraine’s pre-2014 borders is an unrealistic objective. Chasing this illusionary goal will only prolong the war and cause more suffering." -snip- "A durable peace for Ukraine must include robust security guarantees to ensure that the war will not begin again," Hegseth said Wednesday. "The United States does not believe that NATO membership for Ukraine is a realistic outcome of a negotiated settlement. Instead, any security guarantee must be backed by capable European and non-European troops." "If these troops are deployed as peacekeepers to Ukraine at any point, they should be deployed as part of a non-NATO mission and not covered under Article 5. There also must be robust international oversight of the line of contact," he continued. "To be clear, as part of any security guarantee, there will not be U.S. troops deployed to Ukraine." -snip- Hegseth also said he is in Brussels today to "directly and unambiguously express that stark strategic realities prevent the United States from being primarily focused on the security of Europe." "The United States faces consequential threats to our homeland. We must -- and we are -- focusing on securing our own borders," he said.

So I guess we end up with UK European forces ‘containing’ Russia while the USA focuses on the “Indo-Pacific” and China. Defense contractors getting a good cut out of this? Lindsey Graham getting richer? Borrow? We blocked 90 perent of the missiles that were thrown at them :) And you REALLY THINK we didn’t design and build most of Iron Dome? Come on :) I am glad it worked so well during the past year’s war against hamas But we don’t have to BORROW anything. And if we did, we’ve given enough money to have paid for it outright through the decades :) Said here by patriots since 2022 Zelensky could reject this and fight to the last Ukie Male. Zelensky has no choice but to go along with President Trump’s plan. The question is will Zeepers go along with Trumps plan? Many of us have been telling Zeepers this would be the outcome. But some Zeepers reminded us “Kiev in 3 Days” nonsense repeatedly. We will be proven right. Zeepers…not so much. Told you so three years ago. I don’t give a rat’s behind about Ukraine. Never have; never will. I am looking forward to all the corruption that will be exposed, though. Certain Congress critters must be sweating bullets. And blackrock. What this iron dome is supposed to solve? “We blocked 90 perent of the missiles that were thrown at them :)” Is it a joke? More: Hegseth also told Nato’s European members that they would need to provide the lion’s share of future aid for Kyiv, warning that Washington “will no longer tolerate an imbalanced relationship” with its allies. “Safeguarding European security must be an imperative for European members of Nato,” Hegseth told a meeting of Ukraine’s backers in Brussels. “Europe must provide the overwhelming share of future lethal and non-lethal aid to Ukraine.” https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy0pz3er37jo.amp That deserves an echo. One wonders if a Russia friendly government were installed in Ukraine, regardless of how, if this means Europe will still send military and rebuilding aid to Ukraine. You see, it’s not about Ukraine. It’s about maybe 10 guys running the gov’t. yes!

Title: The Bidenomics Atrocity: 7 Migrant Jobs for Each American Job
URL: https://www.breitbart.com/immigration/2025/02/12/bidenomics-final-score-7-jobs-for-migrants-for-each-american-job/
Time Published: 2025-02-12T12:05:21Z

The results are in: The Democratic Party’s Bidenomics strategy produced a disastrous score of just 160,000 extra jobs for Americans during each year of President Joe Biden’s presidency. President Joe Biden’s dismal Bidenomics also created jobs for 4.7 million migrants — including almost three million illegals, according to federal data collected by the Center for Immigration Studies and reported on February 7. So Bidenomics created 7.3 migrant jobs for every job gained by an American, even as it also exploded the national debt by $8 trillion. Bidenomics also flatlined wages, spiked housing costs, and slowed workplace investment. The Bidenomics 7:1 policy — 4.7 million jobs for migrants, 645,000 for Americans — was deliberate. Bidenomics deliberately stranded millions of working-age Americans outside the workforce, without jobs or prospects, often homeless and on drugs, and usually dependent on expensive government aid. “The share of working-age (16 to 64) U.S.-born men not in the labor force — neither working nor looking for work — is likely 22.1 percent in January 2025 and remains near a historic high for an economic expansion,” the Center for Immigration Studies reported February 7. The 22 percent — one in five! — is far above the 16.6 percent seen in January 2000. If Biden and Congress had cared, roughly 5 million working-age American men could have been found, trained to use work-multiplying machinery, de-toxified, put back on their feet, and hired into starter jobs. But Biden’s deputies repeatedly showed that they favored importing more migrants than the once-normal option of helping millions of ordinary Americans get ready for high-productivity jobs. “As our economy grows, we need workers that we just don’t have enough of,” Katie Tobin, the senior director for transborder security on the National Security Council, told a D.C. audience in May 2023. “So it is in our interest to bring people in and to stay competitive globally.” “We look to the north, with Canada,” migration czar Alejandro Mayorkas told a Texas audience in September: Canada takes a look at its market needs, and it says, “You know what? We need 700,000 foreign workers to address our labor needs domestically.” And, so, they build a visa system for that year to address the current market condition. And they say, “We’re going to bring in a million people.” And it’s market sensitive. We [in the United States] are dealing with numerical caps on labor-driven visas that were set in 1996. It’s 2024. The world has changed. It is remarkable how there can be [elite] agreement that [the visas system] is broken and not have an agreement on a solution. The country is suffering as a result of it. During their four years, Buden’s deputies replaced those Americans with a flood of roughly 9 million southern migrants, roughly three million legal airport migrants, and roughly 4 million temporary migrants. Those airport arrivals included roughly 1.5 million white-collar workers carrying H-1B, J-1, L-1, and OPT/EAD visa documents that allow them to take jobs from American college graduates. That huge inflow displaced many Americans from jobs, cities, and the workforce. The displacement was so massive that the share of Americans who held jobs arguably declined during Biden’s years. In a chart posted by Harvard economist Jason Furman, the other countries that did badly on that measure were the migration-flooded United Kingdom, Canada, and Germany. Mayorkas, Tobin, and Biden’s other deputies had several reasons to prefer inviting migrants over helping their fellow Americans. First, migration is a rapid way to expand the national pool of consumers, workers, and renters before the next election. Migration means there is no need to wait 25 years for Americans to marry, raise their kids, and get them into jobs. Their get-rich-quick policy worked; The inflow of migrants quickly expanded the economy, creating a rush of extra profits and new stock values for investors — even as the rush of migrants pushed down wages and pushed up housing costs for ordinary Americans. RELATED — White House Despairs: ‘Pollsters Are Not Asking the Right Questions’ About Biden’s Economic Policies Second, the rush of migrants held down the wage-driven inflation once the gusher of Biden spending spilled into pay packets and weekly wages. That was good for the White House’s friends on Wall Street. For example, Goldman Sachs celebrated the inflow of wage-cutting migrants because it would reduce inflation. Third, Biden’s deputies favored more migration because it reduced the pressure on employers to divert their profits and stock values toward greater workplace productivity. Normally, productivity improvements — such as better-skilled workers, swifter robots, and subtle software — are very desirable because they generate both extra profits for CEOs and higher wages for workers. However, productivity improvements are expensive, so they reduce near-term quarterly profits, stock values, and executive bonuses. This means that most investors are loath to invest in productivity — especially because the government has deliberately helped them by extracting millions of workers and consumers from poor countries since 1990. The results of this cheap labor vs productivity trade-off can be tracked over a few years. For example, the loss of migrant labor during Trump’s first-term crackdown and the coronavirus disease “spurred approximately an additional $55 billion in investment in the U.S. economy,” the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Loius reported in June 2024. But the investment fell — and so did productivity gains — once Biden’s deputies flooded the labor market with cheap migrant workers. Basically, Biden’s team stuffed the economy with more federal dollars, unproductive workers, consumers, and renters — and the stock market zoomed to record levels. MorningStar.com reported: The 46th president of the United States is bringing his time at the White House to a close with the S&P 500 SPX up over 55% since he took office on Jan. 20, 2021. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA advanced more than 39% over the same period, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite COMP jumped nearly 46%, according to Dow Jones Market Data. But there was a flaw. The migrant workers also need to sleep and eat, and so they fuelled rent, housing, and food inflation far more than Biden’s deputies expected. “On net [after inflation], real wages have fallen since January 2021.” former White House economist Furman wrote in a February 10 article for Foreign Affairs. Once inflation ate into wages, ordinary Americans averaged a wage gain of less than half a percent during Biden’s four years. Furman’s economic analysis is titled “The Post-Neoliberal Delusion And the Tragedy of Bidenomics.” The analysis is echoed by one of Elon Musk’s investor friends, Chamath Palihapitiya. He is an immigrant from Sri Lanka who founded Social Capital, which seeks to make money from the health, financial services, and education sectors. Ironically, Trump and his GOP deputies gained many new jobs in January 2025 when the understandably angry voters defenestrated Biden and his deputies in November. Despite the obvious damage and chaos, the establishment’s media is still hiding the Biden/Mayorkas economic disaster from citizens, mostly by posting sympathetic stories urging Americans to empathize with unlucky but hard-working migrants. On February 4, the Washington Post reported on two imported workers who Mayorkas “paroled” into U.S. jobs to reduce the pressure on U.S. employers to raise wages: Among them were a 25-year-old man from the Boston area who asked that his name not be used, because he, his wife and their 3-year-old daughter fear losing their temporary protection and being deported to Venezuela. He said they fled extreme poverty and fear under the authoritarian regime of Nicolás Maduro in 2023, and trekked for three months through a hazardous jungle and north into Mexico in order to reach the U.S. border. In Venezuela, he worked as a construction worker for $30 a week, unable to pay for basics such as milk. In Massachusetts, he earns $180 a day working on a demolition crew and moonlights cleaning at a hotel. His wife also has a job cleaning at a hotel. He said Trump is wrongly portraying Venezuelans as criminals. “We came to this country to work,” he said. For the moment, President Donald Trump is helping to fix the mess by blocking the arrival of Mayorkas’ illegal and quasi-legal migrants. He is also helping by deporting perhaps 1,000 migrants a day, starting with criminals and migrants who have lost their legal appeals to stay. Predictably, establishment media outlets worry that Trump’s shutdown of the Mayorkas migration might raise wages for ordinary Americans. For example, Politico.com reported on February 7 that “a broad-based crackdown on immigrants could slow the economy’s expansion and choke off a supply of workers that Kansas City Fed researchers and others say have alleviated staffing shortages and eased wage pressures [emphasis added].” Rationally, business lobbyists are now working to ensure Mayorkas’ roughly 9 million illegals can stay — and to ensure the continued inflow of more migrants and visa workers. On February 10, BusinessInsider.com reported that a “Make America Wealthy Again” [MAWA] lobbying campaign seeks to persuade Trump to keep most migrants: “Trump as a businessman understands that if he doesn’t have 200 guys cutting the grass at his golf courses, then they don’t look right, and people won’t want to play golf there,” says Cristina Antelo, the founding principal at Ferox Strategies, a lobbying firm that counts the National Retail Federation, Walmart, and the tobacco giant Reynolds America among its clients. “There’s a way to get to Trump and make him realize that. How many businesses does he need to hear from before he’s like, ‘Crap, I really am going to paralyze the entire US labor market if I do this’?” The MAWA plan is to apply pressure on business allies in Trump’s inner circle, rather than on the president directly, and to steer clear of Stephen Miller, the administration’s most outspoken anti-immigration hard-liner. “Stephen Miller won’t ever be convinced. Forget that,” says a lobbyist from a prominent trade association. “But Trump can be convinced not to screw over fellow businesspeople. Miller isn’t the only dude who has Trump’s ear.” … In addition, lobbyists have already begun reaching out to members of Congress and their staffs — both on Capitol Hill and in their districts back home — via phone, Zoom, and in-person meetings. Several lobbyists describe a campaign of “shock and awe,” one that will seek to apply “1,000 points of pressure” to GOP members of Congress who understand that immigrants are willing to take low-paying, high-risk jobs that are shunned by most Americans. Among those being targeted is Rep. Glenn Thompson of Pennsylvania, who chairs the House Agriculture Committee. Trump’s voters backed him because he seemed to promise he would Make Americans Great Again — not just America. If he resists pro-migration pressure from businesses, he may show Americans how a low-migration policy of “tight labor” can create greater productivity, higher wages, more trade, more innovation, and a stronger economy, as Blackrock CEO Larry Fink argues. But Trump is zig-zagging under lobbying pressure from people such as Elon Musk. On Sunday, February 9, for example, Trump again touted a misleading article that defended the H-1B visa program which has been used since 1990 to push millions of American graduates — and their families — out of good careers. The Wall Street Journal article echoed Mayorkas as claimed “U.S. companies find it crucial … And [because] one way to reduce illegal immigration is to allow more legal pathways to meet the needs of the U.S. economy.” Trump has yet to issue a formal policy statement on the increasingly unpopular inflow of white-collar visa workers. But he may be forced to show his cards this week at his White House meeting with India’s Prime Minister. Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting. Copyright © 2025 Breitbart

Title: How Do Young Men See the World? We Asked Them.

Everyone else agrees they’re struggling. But how do men themselves feel about it? We sat down with twelve everyday guys from across America to get their candid opinions—on money, masculinity, Donald Trump—and find out what’s really on their minds. What exactly is going on in the minds of young men? It’s a question that society keeps coming back to these days because, truth is, we’re worried. Everything we’re told about the rising generation of men in America—everything they’re told about themselves, in the media, the academic research, the employment data, the mental-health studies—is about how royally screwed they are. And that has consequences for all of us. You’ve read the headlines. Young men today are angry. They’re lonely and friendless. The data shows that they are falling behind young women in school and at the workplace, living with their parents longer, playing too many video games, watching too much porn, getting married much later in life (or not at all), having fewer kids (or none at all), and facing a lifetime of student-loan debt, credit-card debt, and medical debt. As a result, many of them are adopting increasingly extreme beliefs, getting hooked on opioids, and killing themselves at alarming rates. They feel ignored by politicians, blamed for society’s ills, and forced to keep their toxic, privileged, microaggressive mouths shut about it. But what no one can seem to agree on is why. Is social media to blame? There’s no doubt that growing up in the age of the smartphone has profoundly shaped the lives (and brains) of anyone under twenty-five, and most of the rest of us, too. But that applies to young women as well, and they don’t seem to be drifting as badly as men are. Rather than add our voice to the chorus of speculation about what guys are thinking and feeling about the world, we had a radical idea: Let’s just ask them. Not all of them, of course. There are nearly 16 million men in the U. S. between the ages of eighteen and twenty-four. We weren’t looking to conduct yet another survey. Instead, we wanted to have long conversations with a relatively small group about what it’s like to be a young man in America right now. Our first step was to seek out regular, everyday guys. No influencers or celebrities or lunatics. Just guys like the ones we all know. Guys with so many of their big life decisions still ahead of them. In the end, we settled on twelve men from different parts of the country representing a wide range of backgrounds and experiences. We asked them to submit portrait photos of themselves, and most of them did. As you’ll see, they reflect much of the frustration and alienation we expected—but not always in the ways we anticipated. They were thoughtful and candid. They surprised us. If there was one subject that came up again and again, it was Donald Trump. Timing had a lot to do with it. Our conversations followed Trump’s reelection in November, a victory powered in part by young male voters. Men between the ages of eighteen and twenty-nine voted for Trump over Kamala Harris by a margin of 56–42, a dramatic reversal of 2020, when they voted for Biden over Trump by a 56–41 margin. For the young men we spoke with—guys who’ve come of age in the MAGA era—talking about Trump was often shorthand for discussing class, race, masculinity, and the big subjects that were really on their minds. Here’s what they had to say, in their own words. I noticed the shift in people of color moving conservative a year, maybe a year and a half in advance. I remember a conversation with my mom about seven months before the election—we were in the swimming pool, and she was like, “Oh, this election, I’m not sure what’s going to happen.” And I told her, “Trump has already won the election. I know for a fact.” Because he’d stolen the support of people of color from the Democrats, especially men. You could just see it. The first thing I noticed was how conservative so many young Hispanic men were—it is mind-­boggling to me how conservative. My girlfriend is half Latino, and she kept telling me, “Aidan, Latino men are more conservative than people think.” This notion that Latinos always support Democrats—it’s very false. I was also noticing in my community, a bunch of Asian American men, they were thinking the same way. They were starting to talk out loud about supporting Trump. The first thing was the LGBTQ community normalizing the idea that you can have a bunch of genders, you can have whatever pronouns you want, and that you can introduce that to very young children. And then with Asian men, the Harvard case that overturned affirmative action a few years ago—remember, the people who filed the lawsuit were not white. They were Chinese. They were like, Wait, affirmative action discriminates against us. That’s when the Chinese vote started to go. And then I did not realize this, but my girlfriend’s also Vietnamese, and she was telling me that most Vietnamese people are conservative. So guess what? Now Trump’s got the Vietnamese support. And obviously his white male support is only growing. So in my head I’m like, How is Biden going to win this election? He’s lost half the people of color to Trump. To me, it’s not necessarily that men were drawn to Trump—it’s men pulling away from Democrats. That’s one key thing I really want to say. I think this shift happened not necessarily because of anything Trump was doing. It’s because of what the Democrats did. They decided to let in all this pronoun stuff and this whole idea of censoring young men and emasculating them. And then with people of color, like me, they seem to assume, like, Of course you’re going to vote for us. We’re your allies. We’re going to help you. The Republicans aren’t going to do anything for you. But then the Democrats get in power in 2020, and people of color are kind of waiting, like, Okay, so . . . what are you going to do for us? And then you look at the end and the Black community is still in the same position. Asian Americans are now getting discriminated against in educational systems, and you’re losing Latinos because of this LGBTQ stuff that’s relevant to literally 1 percent of the population and you’re trying to kind of force it on everyone else. I dropped out of community college because I got a job as a butler at the Venetian casino and I was making good money, so I put everything else on the back burner. What a butler does is, from the moment the whales and high-end guests arrive, we greet them, we grab their things, we bring them their food, we do everything they need—personalized and intimate service. The tips can get pretty big. I got $750 once. I know a guy who once got $5,000. But that job didn’t work out. There was an issue where I accepted a tip—for one dollar—and I forgot to write it down on my log at the end of the day. The next day I had to go out of town, and by the time I came back, HR was already involved. Every square inch of that building is monitored. When they saw on my log that I didn’t have anything tipped in, one of the other coworkers was like, “No, no—I was right there when he accepted his tip.” He ratted me out. They went back into the footage and I got fired. I was very, very upset. I was ready to settle down and get really good at that job. I like learning new things, and it was this world of whiskeys and wine and fine dining—all this luxurious stuff that I’d never been exposed to. I grew up lower middle class, so it was an entirely new world. That was the best part about coming into work every day—something new to learn, a new problem to solve. And then all of a sudden I was back at my job at Domino’s. Being a butler definitely jaded me. Look, I feel like successful people should be able to appreciate the fruits of their labor. That doesn’t bother me. And a lot of rich people aren’t insanely rich—they’re millionaires, not billionaires. They’re normal people when it comes down to it. But when you start dealing with old-money people—how they treat the people around them and the people under them—it opens your eyes. I would overhear conversations around a poker table where executives are talking like, “Well, if we get rid of this department here and we lay off six hundred people here, we can put that money here.” Meanwhile they’re playing poker with $100,000 a hand. The most insane thing I can remember was buying suitcases for a guest because they bought all these bottles of liquor from us and they needed something to take them home in. Two suitcases full of approximately $300,000 worth of wine and liquor. It’s the frivolousness that’s the breaking point for me—the way they can spend all that money and have no repercussions, but those repercussions spread to us, lower down. It’s fucking bullshit. I have friends going hungry, not because they don’t want to work but because they’re not given enough hours to be full-time and get health insurance. Five years ago, if you had a job that paid fifteen to twenty dollars an hour, you were set. And now it doesn’t feel like that anymore. Your dollar just doesn’t go as far. Real estate has doubled here in Vegas. The eleven-hundred-square-foot apartment that I rented with my girlfriend in 2018 for $1,100—I looked a few weeks ago, and now it’s going for $1,950. It’s so hard to build savings right now. I spent years building up enough for a down payment on a house, and I’d just gotten to the point where I could feasibly do it, and then I needed to pay for a car repair earlier this year and a lot of that money went away. You learn to live with this fear and paranoia, like, What if I shatter my leg and I can’t work? What would I do? I am not a fan of Donald Trump—I’d say I lean very left—but at the end of the day, he understands that Americans are angry and upset, and he’s really good at channeling that. As Americans, we’re all feeling the same pressures, we all see prices are rising, we’re all making less money. We all notice it. But the Republicans are a lot more ready to say, “This is the reason. It’s that guy. This is who you should be mad at.” The bigger split in America for me is not left or right. It’s class—it’s whether you’re bourgeois or you’re proletariat. It comes down to whether you make enough money to be in their special club. There’s this pastor I like to listen to named Voddie Baucham, and he talks about how men think the definition of manhood is the Three B’s: the billfold, the ball field, and the bedroom. Like, it’s all about how much money you make, how well you perform at sports, and how many girls you can get with in the bedroom. And I think that’s . . . not totally wrong? I mean they are signs. If you can perform on the ball field, that shows power and strength and your ability to protect yourself, which is important. If you’re making money, that doesn’t automatically mean you’re competent, but it shows signs of competency. And then bedroom—I don’t know, that one doesn’t make as much sense. But his point was that the Three B’s are how the culture is defining manhood today, and the correct way is how the Bible defines it, which is all about love and family and sacrifice. My friends say I’m a based Christian guy—“based” like based in truth, someone who’s more realistic and objective. I appreciate the objective truth of conservatism, but I also understand the compassion of liberals. Overall, I’d say I’m like 60 percent conservative, 40 percent liberal. Maybe 70–30. And Christianity is a really good guide for being conservative, because there’s this objective eternal being at the center of it who’s been unchanged the whole time. And I do believe some things are just objectively true, like: I am a man. It doesn’t really matter if someone wants to be called a man—that doesn’t change what you are. Sorry, that’s it. You weren’t assigned it by a doctor. You were assigned it by God. And going against that is rebellion. If God’s making these rules, it’s not because He wants to be a cosmic killjoy. If I’m going to trust anyone about the world, I would trust the person who made it. It’s like going against the video game developer’s ideas for how to play the video game. You’re just going to lose. For thousands of years, men have been the rock of society. And now because there have been so many tyrannical leaders, people want to take that power away from men and say it’s for everybody. Just because some men did it the wrong way. Like, it’s kind of unfair to men to say, “We don’t need you anymore because of how well you did at building a society.” And I’m like, “Well, we kind of built this country and fought and died for it . . .” I didn’t vote, because I didn’t feel like going through the process, and I didn’t see the point, because Biden was going to win California, even though it was way closer than I thought. But if someone had put a gun in my head and told me to vote, I would’ve voted for Trump. I think minority guys are tired of feeling like they are expected to vote a certain way just because of their color. Even Obama, who basically shamed Black guys for not voting for Kamala—I don’t owe you anything. I don’t owe this party nothing. I’m not going to get reprimanded by you when I’m an autonomous man who can make decisions for myself. I don’t need you to browbeat me like I’m your son. Sometimes I think we’re like an anti-welfare state. We’re not really into helping people in this country. I just feel like we live in a very individualistic society, and so it’s all about “How do you stand out as an individual? How do you make yourself stand out from the pack?” You can even see this with car culture in our country—young men always want to buy the most massive truck and drive around in it. I live outside Denver in a town called Golden, and the Colorado School of Mines, which is a big petroleum and gas college, is here in Golden. So a lot of guys come out here from Texas and they drive these giant lifted pickup trucks—these massive old F-150’s that’ve been jacked up so there’s like three feet of separation between the wheels and the body. I grew up with a lot of these guys in Bozeman, Montana—cowboy-type dudes. That’s manhood out here in the western states: Every man wants to be a cowboy. They want to buy cowboy boots and the cowboy hat and drive an old pickup truck, or the new pickup truck if they’re wealthy. And they vote for Republicans. I didn’t really like those guys. I grew up with two sisters, so I guess I’ve always been more comfortable around women. If you’re not overconfident, it’s really hard to get ahead in this country. You really have to act like you know what you’re talking about all the time. And that’s definitely not something that I was doing in the past. I hate talking about myself, promoting myself. But when I decided to go to grad school, I just kind of made up my mind that I was going to start. I made this separation in my brain between my home life and my work life—at work, I was going to be this alternative person who was really competitive and confident all the time and could talk about himself very easily. And as soon as I made that switch, people were a lot more attracted to me. I’m getting treated better by this country, by our systems, our culture. That’s how America works. People in this country love confident people who seem like they’re smart, who seem to know what they’re talking about, even if they don’t. And Donald Trump is the embodiment of the confident man who doesn’t know what he’s talking about. He’s like: Take what you want, grab it, it’s yours—everyone else is telling you you’re not supposed to be this way, but you’re allowed to be this way because I’m this way. He’s kind of a reaction to all the beta cucks out there—men like me, I guess. But I don’t think that it’s just my generation of men that’s angry. I think it’s all of them. It’s the emotion that men are taught. It’s the one that we get. It’s not manly to feel all the other ones. But anger is for sure. My generation—I don’t think we have very much power, so maybe that’s part of our anger. Our lives are being dictated by people who are decades and decades older than us, and they just don’t get it. They just don’t understand that the world has changed, that you can’t buy a house for three lucky magic beans anymore. I feel like our generation is just waiting for our moment to take up our power, but I don’t know if we’re ever going to get there, because it seems like these boomers are trying to hang on forever. I see it in my work, too—anytime you go to a public hearing or a city-­council meeting, they dominate those meetings, because they have time and resources to show up. They’re really dictating our future even though it’s not going to affect them. And that’s really frustrating. It’s like they were raised in a time of bounty and we don’t get a slice of the pie. They have the entire pie. I was born in Nicaragua and immigrated with my parents to the United States when I was really young. We lived in Miami for a few years, then in 2004 we moved to El Paso, Texas, and that’s where I grew up. Now I teach at an all-boys Catholic private school in California, and my kids are juniors—the age where they think they know everything and can get away with anything. Before the election this past November, some of them were asking me political things, like, “Yo, Mr. O”—that’s what they call me, Mr. O—“what do you think of Trump?” And I’d always say, “That’s not your business.” I’d tell them that the faculty handbook says I have to be nonpartisan. And one of them said, “But we need to know! Please don’t tell me you voted for Kamala!” And this was actually a Black student, by the way. Not that just because you’re Black, you should be voting for Kamala—it was just a little more unexpected. I come to find out that a lot of my students, and I mean a lot of them, are very conservative. Our school is very, very sports heavy. Our academics are amazing, don’t get me wrong—but sports are where it shines. Out of about 1,100 total students, maybe 900 are student athletes, and of course football is king. There was even a movie about our team that came out like a decade ago. I’ve been there three years now, but when I first started, I was this five-foot-eight, soft-spoken Hispanic teacher, and I’m teaching all these sixteen- and seventeen-year-olds who were six-foot-five, these enormous—like, what are they putting in the water here? Think of a hobbit in the Shire—that’s me, and everyone else is the elves. My first year, especially, was really hard because they could get very disrespectful. I had students yell at me, berate me just for asking them to put their phones away. It’s like, “Why am I being abused right now?” They wouldn’t necessarily make it obvious that it was because they think I’m less of a man or because I’m smaller. But I could tell it didn’t help. For a lot of these kids, their norm was coaches who would yell at them, which is not how I roll. There were days when I broke down in front of the students. I just couldn’t handle it anymore. It was like they were experimenting with dominance. And I mention all this because I think they really want that dominance to continue. I think they like getting away with talking very, very confidently. And I think they see Trump talking what I think is nonsense, but they’re like, “Oh, wow—he gets away with saying that!” And so they want to emulate that. They want that power. There was this friend group in my class that year—all of them were athletes for different sports, and they actually ended up becoming one of my favorite groups of students. The next year, they told me I was their favorite teacher. Even the ones who gave me a lot of issues said that. And I was like, “Wow, thank you—but if I’m your favorite teacher, why did you behave like this to me? Are you only going to follow the people who berate you? Are those the only people you’re going to respect? Because that’s kind of a crappy way to live, no?” And they said it was because my class was the only break they got from hard teachers and hard coaches. It was like a period of peace. They’d spend the rest of the day getting taught that weakness must be stamped out and eradicated. And then they meet me and I flip the whole thing on its head. Sometimes I do think to myself, Why am I like this? I’m not going to get anywhere being like this. I do get resentful sometimes. I’m not going to lie. I do feel—not marginalized, but I feel like when people think of men or masculinity, I’m not the image that comes to their head. I’ve always felt that way. At the same time, so many people, whether it be my classmates, my friends, my relatives, my students, my coworkers, everyone has said, “Jacinto, you’re one of the kindest people I’ve ever met—please don’t ever, ever change.” And it’s like, “Okay, see? So we do celebrate this other side of the coin. Sometimes.” When the election happened, I was so blindsided and distraught that for a month or so I just kind of turned that whole part of my brain off. I guess I live in a bubble, right? I go to NYU—a very liberal school, very performatively progressive, though I think the key word there is performative. But needless to say, I don’t have anybody close to me who voted for Trump or even considered voting for him. I guess that’s why I really thought Kamala was going to win. I wasn’t even that worried, because in my mind, I was like, We already went through four years of this douchebag. We know the type of person that he is. I just really thought that people were sick of him, regardless of where you are on the political spectrum. And then I was watching those numbers on election night, and that sinking feeling started, just like in 2016. I’m trying to make sense of it now. I’ve really tried to put myself in the mindset of just your average twenty-year-old Latino dude, because I know that’s where he gained a surprising advantage, and that shocked me the most. I guess a couple things jump out. Like, whether you like it or not, Trump does fall into that ultramasculine, ultra-fragile-ego archetype, and he disguises the fragility with machismo, with bravado, with boldness. Saying things with his chest. No matter how wrong he is, he carries this energy of absolute confidence. And I think that when you’re an impressionable young man, that’s appealing. It’s like, “I want to be a guy who’s not afraid to say whatever I want to say.” I’m the son of a Mexican immigrant who’s legal now—he has a green card—but for a while, he wasn’t. And I remember being a young kid in 2016 and hearing Trump say those things about Mexicans being rapists and criminals. And so obviously I’m like, That’s not who I am. That’s not who my father is. So in my mind, from a young age, there was an immediate fuck-you toward Trump. I identify with the immigrants from all these Latin American countries. I identify with that struggle. I see their pain. But not all Latino people, and especially not all Latino men, think that way. They feel like they’re citizens, they’re good, their family’s good. Whereas the people coming here now—they think they can just walk in, hand themselves over to border authorities, and then get shipped off to a sanctuary city without having to go through all of the pain that my family went through? That’s not fair. I definitely sense this sort of Democrat-­equals-good sentiment among my friends, but I very much do not identify with the Democratic Party. Seeing how people like Joe Biden were utterly indifferent to—actively in support of—Israel’s genocide, like, yes, on paper, at a glance, the Democratic Party has more of a progressive agenda, but in practice, do they? That was how I felt about Kamala, to be honest. Obviously I wasn’t going to vote for Trump—hell no, never—but I wasn’t a fan of Kamala, either. Her history, the fact that she was a prosecutor, that she put so many Black and brown people in jail—she kept showing she had no spine and no actual beliefs leading up to the election. I was debating who to vote for right up until I walked into that stall in the voting station—Harris or a third party. I voted for Kamala largely due to my mom, just how important her victory would’ve been for female reproductive rights and how catastrophic it would be if Trump won. And then he did. I need to make money and be self-­sufficient as soon as I can because my mom turns sixty next year, and if she’s still hustling and working her ass off at eighty, I’m going to feel like I failed. I’ve got to make sure that in some way, shape, or form, I can give back to my parents and start helping them out by the time I’m like thirty. That’s a big priority for me. And I don’t doubt that I’ll make money. I know I have skills, and it’s not like I’m just going to be sitting around. The doubt is about whether I can make enough to support my parents one day, to live an actually comfortable life, to have savings, a 401(k), a retirement plan. The doubt is about living a financially stable life as opposed to just living check to check or gig to gig. I will try my best, but I’m going to be honest, I know that the odds are not good. My generation is not in an optimal position. Honestly, it kind of feels like I was born too late. Like I missed out on something. It feels like I’m living in a generation where we’re cleaning up after someone else’s mess. I like to tell people I went to college undecided and I kind of came out the same way. I graduated in May of 2023. When I came home, I didn’t really know what I wanted to do. I moved back in with my parents, and that’s where I am now. My mom’s a school librarian, so she said, “Why don’t you try being a para-­educator?” And I said, “Well, I don’t have any other plans,” so now I help with third graders. It’s been a good year, and I’m grateful to have done it, but I don’t think I’d want to be a teacher. And being a para-educator is not a job where I’d be able to move out and afford rent and groceries and such. And you can’t really pay your bills with a philosophy degree. I play a lot of video games. This hat I’m wearing is from a game called Oblivion that came out in 2006. It’s like a fantasy role-playing kind of game. I’ve played several thousand hours throughout that series, and it’s like a lot of online spaces where you find young dudes—whether it’s video games or TV shows or Star Wars or sports or music or whatever. It’s not something you pick up on unless you’re in these spaces a lot. But take Star Wars: A lot of the top creators in those spaces are right-wing people talking about how some new Disney show is woke and bad, or how it’s forcing some lib agenda. Like, the most famous Star Wars YouTuber is a guy named Star Wars Theory, and most of his videos are just trashing all the new Star Wars shows for being DEI, whatever the term of the day is. In a lot of spaces that young men naturally gravitate toward, there’s already kind of a pipeline built, a feeling or environment of “This thing I like is under attack.” I don’t know who said it, but there’s a quote that sticks with me: “When you’re accustomed to privilege, equality looks like an attack.” A lot of reactionary sentiment is built on nostalgia. And the Right in America has realized that you can weaponize that natural disenchantment with the world and spin it as: Something that you like is being attacked by the Left. And to me, it’s a uniquely right-wing phenomenon—the ability to infiltrate any space and be able to steer people toward that intellectual viewpoint. Once I noticed it, it was hard not to be aware of it. Whereas I think the Left, broadly speaking, does not have anything remotely equivalent. It’s the same tenor in these manosphere communities about women. I’ve only really had one serious relationship—a long story, but it didn’t work out. I’m not a big fan of the whole manosphere and red pill and all that stuff, but there were definitely times when I’d find myself scrolling on my phone, and I’d come across videos, obviously framed to show how women are bad, and I wouldn’t agree with them, but I could kind of say, at least for a little while, “Yeah, that’s how it feels.” It’s just a lot easier to feel like you’re the victim of some wrongdoing. And if you’re a young man who suffers some sort of ego injury, that online ecosystem is very easy to plug yourself into. That pipeline is ready and waiting. I want to be champion, bro. My life is very difficult right now, and I do that to myself. I have to make it. It’s not about plan B. It’s not about plan C, bro. This isn’t like wrestling or football where there’s scholarships to college. If you don’t make it in MMA, you’re back to square one. That’s kind of the thrill of it, too, if I’m being honest. I had a really tough upbringing, and it turned me into kind of a sad person. My dad’s from Cape Town in South Africa. I had neighbor kids who had all this cool shit, got to play video games for eight hours a day, or who lost a tooth and then the tooth fairy came and dropped a Nintendo DS under their pillow. I never had that stuff. We were living paycheck to paycheck. We couldn’t afford meat every day of the week. My father opened up this gym, but it didn’t make any money for eight years. So he worked another full-time job, and then he also fought a little bit. The gym’s super successful now, but it was tough, bro. Life’s tough. So Coeur d’Alene—I’m pretty sure they say it’s the fastest-growing city in the nation. I mean, it’s just crazy, bro. Like holy smoke. When my dad moved here for college, this was a one-stoplight town, and now it’s just a massive city. We get a ton of people from California who are like, “We don’t like our state anymore—it’s getting dangerous down there. So we’re going to go over to Idaho and change things.” Then they make it more like California. What they’re doing in the schools is just wrong. After Covid, the underclassmen just got progressively worse. Kids wearing weird stuff. Just really borderline satanic stuff. Weird colors. It’s gotten super free, in the wrong sense. Then after I graduated, they started doing the transgender bathroom stuff, so now they got a bathroom for them folks. So that is courtesy of the California people. I can’t name a Democrat in this gym right now. I can’t name a friend who’s a Democrat. I don’t know anybody who voted for Kamala, honestly—anybody that’s sober. Maybe some pothead buddies that aren’t really friends of mine. But the blue side is winning, dude. This younger generation—these kids are getting brainwashed into thinking blue. And blue is definitely not a righteous route. I mean, we still don’t have the full list of Epstein’s folks. A lot of these blue guys are just totally numb to the fact that there’s right ways and wrong ways to do things in life. They just don’t care. But common sense is coming back a little bit—that’s what I thought when Trump won. And I’m so thankful he won, because he says common-sense stuff, like building up the border wall. That sounds offensive, but it makes sense, because we all know where the drugs are coming from, and it’s not Canada. Also, I used to work in construction, so I see all these Hispanic folks that are working for nine or ten bucks an hour, and they’re doing double the work the Americans are doing, because they have to survive. Like, they actually are taking our jobs. They are. So I’m not a fan of immigration in that sense. The neighborhood where I grew up in Philadelphia—it wasn’t the worst, but it definitely wasn’t the best. My mother struggled through so much raising us. I learned from her that it’s okay to falter, but you can’t give up. I went to a horrible, underfunded public school. I wanted to be the first person in my family to graduate college, and I could see that my school wasn’t going to get me anywhere close. So I secretly applied to a private school that my mother didn’t know about. And they were so impressed that they reached out to me, gave me a tour, gave me a financial-aid package, and I started there my junior year. I went from a school that was like 98 percent Black to a predominantly white school—one of the best private schools in the country, where I got exposed to different opinions and learned how to challenge the current ideology that exists in any atmosphere. And that’s really guided me through my political transition to this day. A couple of years ago, like in 2020, 2021, I had blue hair. I was very far-left progressive. I protested for Black Lives Matter. I was 100 percent pro-choice. But the shift really began at this private school—all boys as well. In class we’d talk about things like the American Dream, and does it exist for African Americans? Everyone was saying the same thing: Systemic racism is the issue, and how horrible our country is. And just to be a contrarian, I said, “What if there are cultural or personal-responsibility issues that lead some people to fall short of their dreams? I went to a public school where I saw so many kids, the number-one obstacle in their lives wasn’t not having a father in their life—they just weren’t doing their homework.” The Black students at this private school, who were predominantly wealthy, found that offensive. They said, “You just got here, and you’re giving these white boys permission to think they’re right. You should just shut up.” They started a campaign of threatening me. If I sat next to them at lunch, they’d get up and walk away. I was completely iced out. I even got kicked out of the Black Student Union. They said, “If you come to another meeting, we’re going to have a problem.” And then all the slurs came. He’s an Uncle Tom. He’s just a Black mouth with white talking points. I’m very used to that now—if you call me those things, I don’t really care. But back then I felt like I was a horrible person, so I just bottled up all of my doubt. I basically had to neuter myself. One of the things I started to notice while I was arguing my leftist points to my conservative friends—like about getting vaccinated, supporting Trump—they would just ask me a lot of questions. They wouldn’t get mad at me. One of the conservatives I hated the most was Tucker Carlson, but I finally listened to one of his most controversial takes—about white replacement theory, and immigration—and I thought, “Look, I want to hate the guy, but I can’t really disagree with what he’s saying.” I’d been told for so long not to go look at these sources because they’re racist, they’re regressive, they’re harmful. And actually, it turns out I’m left wanting more. That’s when I did a full factory reset. I tried to relearn things from the ground up. When I look at most of the young men in my life, a lot of them are very sheepish about what they believe. They hold their beliefs to themselves. And conservatives have to talk in a certain way so they don’t alienate you, they don’t polarize, they don’t make it seem as if they’re trying to disrespect you. They’re always on the back burner trying to defend themselves. A few weeks ago in class, we had a group assignment, and this one girl in our group—I knew she was a feminist, I knew she was a control freak, and I knew she was going to sink our grade. But none of the guys in my group, including me, wanted to tell her no about anything. We didn’t want to speak over her. You could tell we were subconsciously teaming up to protect her from the idea that we were trying to mansplain to her, or that we were trying to hurt her feelings. And when I talk to older men who are in the corporate world, they do the same thing. We’re all holding ourselves back from our natural behavior. We’ve ceded so much power. Voting for Trump has made me more unyielding. I don’t necessarily care who I offend. I’m not doing it to harm you. I’m doing it because sometimes ideas have to offend people. They have to invoke some kind of passion. Out of all the hardest things someone can do in life, I think coming out of poverty is first. And then coming out of the progressive trap is probably second. This article appeared in the March 2025 issue of Esquiresubscribe I’m cisgender. I’m heterosexual. I’m not white, but I tick all the other categories that seem to form like the bad straw-man character on the Left, if you know what I mean. In these discourses you see on the Internet, on social media, you’ll have a lot of these left-wing influencers, these feminists just going on tirades against men—like, men are responsible for this, men are responsible for that, yada, yada, yada. Part of the reason why we’re experiencing a loneliness epidemic and we have all these crazy influencers like Andrew Tate out there is because we as a society, I think, have told men that they’re not valued and that whatever natural traits they exhibit are written off as toxic masculinity. We’re told to express ourselves, be vulnerable—but then the moment we are vulnerable, we’re still judged. Like, “Why are you that vulnerable?” Or if you grew up in a really tough, traditional, machismo family, you’re told the exact opposite: Keep everything in. So you either keep everything in and let that balloon grow and grow until one day it pops, or you try to let some of it out, get judged, and then never do it again. I’m not one of those manosphere guys or anything like that, but for a long time I did feel like, as a guy, I was kind of being sidelined. There was a time in my life when I considered myself pretty liberal, but then just the way I’d get shut down if I had a viewpoint that was maybe a little different—like, on abortion, there was a time in high school when I genuinely didn’t know what abortion was because my Indian parents never talked about it. I learned about it in school when Roe v. Wade got overturned. This one girl who I grew up with, I asked her, “Oh, what’s abortion? I don’t know what that is.” And she was like, “It’s when a pregnancy gets terminated.” And I was like, “What do you mean terminated? The baby dies?” And she was like, “Yeah, basically.” And I was like, “Well, isn’t that murder? Why would someone want to do that?” And she got super mad at me. She actually threatened to hit me. I’m a child of immigrants, but you seem to get more benefits as an illegal migrant than if you’re a citizen here. They get housed in hotels, they get debit cards, and yet there’s so many veterans on the streets who don’t get any of it. Last summer I applied for this internship at a major investment firm on their portfolio-management team, and I clicked on this scholarship application where they’ll give $20,000 toward your tuition. And I got an offer for an accelerated interview. So I tell my dad about it—an accelerated interview at the biggest asset manager in the world! And he was like, “What do you mean ‘accelerated interview’? They only give those to marginalized communities—they only give those to people who are LGBT and Black and Hispanic and all that.” He said, “You should email them and tell them you’re not one of those.” So I send an email. I tell them, “Hey, thank you for the offer, but I don’t think I should be interviewed in this way because I don’t fit into those categories.” They were like, “Okay, well, thanks for telling us.” And then a few weeks later, I got rejected. So my initial thought was like, Okay, so they were going to consider me because I ticked a few identity markers—but now that I don’t, they get rid of me? I still have this negative view of affirmative action because of it—because it’s like they were willing to lower the standard for me. It’s demeaning. And obviously you’re never going to be happy because—whether people say it out loud or not—you’ll always be seen as the guy who got in because there was a lower standard. I voted for Biden in 2020, and I voted for Trump in 2024. I didn’t like Trump back in 2020, and I still don’t really like him. He’s got the kind of persona that I despise—that kind of main character, center of the universe, got pampered a lot as a kid, all that. And he was definitely a sore loser in 2020. I voted against him in 2020 because I just didn’t like how the last four years went, the amount of polarization, the way he handled the pandemic. So I voted against him. And then this time I voted against Biden by voting for Trump. It’s ridiculous the way the Left has portrayed Trump as this threat to democracy when they’ve done a lot of things that are just as bad. Like, it was obvious they couped against Biden, and it’s not like they had an open primary where other Democrats could run. They just put Kamala in there. Then Biden pardoned his son after he said he wouldn’t. I also think the Justice Department is politicized. Sure, maybe Trump has some legit cases against him, but why are they trying to fish for everything they can? I definitely admire his resilience. He’s got all these court cases on him, all these convictions, and yet he’s still out there campaigning like crazy. Trump’s also got, what, two assassination attempts on him? Not to mention the entire media machine being against him, the entire political machine being against him, even Republicans. And yet he’s out there winning. There’s a lot of talking points in the world right now about a male loneliness epidemic. And for the most part, I would venture to say the people who focus on it tend to be right-wing grifters trying to make a buck off of male rage. That being said, many of the young men in my life—certainly not all, I wouldn’t even say most, but way, way more than I’d think is normal—have no close friends. Like, they have guys they go out and drink with. But if something is weighing on you, if your mom is sick, I could probably name three or four men in my everyday life who would have no one in their lives to speak to about that. That extends to their relationships with women. A disproportionate amount of the men in my life are single. I’m not a single guy, so I can’t speak to this personally, but I know there’s a lot of incel-­adjacent bitterness around that fact. These guys have spent their entire adult lives single and have grown to resent women for that. And it’s exacerbated when you go online, you go on YouTube and TikTok, and there are men reinforcing this idea that actually you’ve been right all along, you are right to be waiting for the “highest-value woman”—that’s what they call it—and every other woman who won’t date you, those women are bad. They’re sexually promiscuous, they’re ignorant, and you’re right to be angry at them. So many men are hearing this messaging and develop a sense of bitterness that drives them away from the women in their life—not just potential partners, but their mothers, their sisters. I try not to associate with people who harbor real bitterness for women, but I mean, I think about the way that some of them talk in my classes—men who take a gender-studies class just to dunk on the feminist talking points they hear. They view themselves as on some kind of crusade to be the logical voice of reason in the room. Like, in a moment of social reckoning, a moment of reorganization where there are more women in college than men, they view themselves as a last bastion, a final crusader in the quest to defend masculinity from an emasculating society. It’s a really sad thing. It’s embarrassing to watch. And if you asked those men in those lectures what they’re so angry about, they’d say they’re mad that their side of the story is not being told, when in fact their side of the story is the most well-­reported, well-documented, well-studied thing in the history of the world. In this election, it seemed like the Democrats were focusing on just women’s issues and women’s rights, we need a woman in office, everything just centered around women—and I am in no way degrading women, that’s fine—but they left out the entire other gender. There wasn’t anything for young men or pretty much men in general. It was just women’s this, women’s that. And for men, we’re like, “What about us?” The problem with today’s society, and especially with my generation, is everyone just focuses on, “Oh, men have had this and men have had that over the course of history.” They’ve had better benefits or they’ve gotten paid more. And what about women? What about women’s equality? Which I’m not opposed to—I do feel like women should be paid equally. Although if that’s what we want, then women need to start integrating themselves in the jobs that men naturally do. You’re not going to see a woman doing tile work. There’s not a single woman on the job sites that I work in. There’s not a single woman working in the coal mines or the oil rigs. If we want to have an equal society, then women need to start doing these jobs. At the end of the day, who Trump is as a person is not my concern. What he does in his daily life, the way that he acts, his whole demeanor, is not reflective of my opinions. It all goes back to what he will do to better the country. That’s what I’m concerned with—the things that affect my life. So his rants on Twitter and all that stuff, yeah, it’s stupid and I don’t agree with it. He should stop doing it. I mean, it’s kind of funny, but it’s also pretty stupid for a political leader to be ranting on Twitter like that. At the end of the day, though, it doesn’t affect me. What affects me is what he’s going to do for the country. All these Democrats keep saying he’s going to be the fall of America, which is just an idiotic remark to make, because if he was the fall of America, it would’ve fallen already. We still have our democracy, we still have our freedoms, we still have our right to believe in our own values and religion and anything that you want to believe in. I feel like Democrats just have this hatred for Trump himself. They don’t have a problem with what we as Republicans believe in. They just hate Trump. During the four years he was president, all they did was try to indict him, impeach him, get him out of office. And the last few years, they’ve been trying to put him in jail. It’s been really shocking to see what they were doing to him. The Democrats are always preaching about, “Oh, he’s going to be the fall of democracy and the end of America.” Yet they’re the ones inciting a world where you can decide someone’s unfit to be president just because you don’t like them. History will speak for itself, though. Because at the end of the day, in 2030, in a hundred years, whatever, our kids are going to be reading about Trump in their history books. You don’t need to like him as a person, but it’s undeniable the impact he’s had on the country. Whether it’s George Washington or Barack Obama or Donald Trump, our kids in future generations are going to know their names. What in the Mitch McConnell Is Going On?!

Title: How Goldman Sachs Doubling Down on Bitcoin ETFs Boosts New Crypto Like Meme Index

Time Published: 2025-02-12T10:15:36Z
Full Content:
New York-based banking titan Goldman Sachs has more than doubled its Bitcoin exchange-traded fund ($BTC EFT) holdings. The company’s latest quarterly report reveals it now holds $1.57B in $BTC ETFs, more than twice its Q3 2024 value. Most of Goldman Sachs’ funds – over $1.25B – lie in BlackRock’s IBIT (iShares Bitcoin Trust). Sachs also holds a sizable chunk of Ethereum ($ETH) ETFs and other crypto options. Let’s unpack why this matters for the wider crypto market and for new crypto projects like Meme Index. In the previous quarter, Goldman Sachs reported it held $461M worth of IBIT shares, which made it the fund’s second-largest holder, only rivaled by Millennium Management with its $844M pile. Additionally, Sachs bought $288M worth of Fidelity’s FBTC (Wise Origin Bitcoin ETF). Its $3.6M GBTV (Grayscale Bitcoin Trust) holdings, however, remained unchanged. Sachs’ other crypto options now total $760M, and its $ETH portfolio grew nearly 19x from $25.1M last quarter to $476.5M. Half of Goldman Sachs’ $ETH exposure is through Fidelity’s FETH (Fidelity Ethereum Fund) and half through BlackRock’s ETHA (iShares Ethereum Trust). Overall, the 12 $BTC ETFs saw $40.46B in net inflows since their launch. BlackRock’s IBIT is the largest fund with $40.87B in inflows, followed by Fidelity’s FBTC with $12.60B inflows. Grayscale’s GBTC suffered $21.95B outflows. The scale of $ETH ETF investments can’t compete with $BTC. Still, institutional interest is evident from $3.17B cumulative inflows. BlackRock yet again leads the pack with its ETHA fund ($4.44B inflows), while Grayscale’s ETHE falls behind with $3.95B outflows. While banking giants build their crypto portfolios, degen investors are reviving old-school TradFi concepts. Meme Index ($MEMEX) is rolling out the world’s first meme coin index. Essentially, it provides exposure to the $120B meme coin market through four baskets that cater to different risk appetites. Each of the baskets contains eight tokens, from OG memes like Dogecoin ($DOGE) to new, volatile players like Fartcoin ($FARTCOIN). By spreading investment across several projects, you offset potential losses and risk. The $MEMEX token presale kicked off in January and has already hit the $3.5M milestone. One $MEMEX now costs $0.0160993, but the price is set to increase tomorrow. Never before did degens have the opportunity to gain exposure to highly speculative assets in such a safe way. Given this unique positioning, $MEMEX could reach $0.074 by the end of 2025 and bring its supporters even greater gains in the long run. To buy $MEMEX, visit the official presale website, connect your wallet, and pay with $ETH, $BNB, $USDT, or a bank card. Alternatively, secure your share of tokens through Best Wallet’s top presales aggregator. Goldman Sachs isn’t just dipping its toes in the crypto waters – it’s diving in headfirst. Wall Street heavyweights investing billions in crypto suggests it is now perceived as a legitimate asset class, which will surely drive broader adoption and innovation. Meanwhile, the crypto community is taking pages from Wall Street’s book, with creative solutions like $MEMEX providing a safer entry into the meme coin market for risk-averse investors. As always, though, we remind you to DYOR before investing in any cryptocurrency. The market is notoriously volatile, and even tools like indexes don’t fully mitigate the risk.

Title: Report: Pro-Migration Lobbyists Plan to Surround, Submerge Donald Trump
URL: https://www.breitbart.com/economy/2025/02/12/pro-migration-lobbyists-plan-to-surround-submerge-donald-trump/
Time Published: 2025-02-12T09:48:58Z
Full Content:
A coordinated alliance of lobbyists are submerging President Donald Trump and selected GOP politicians under many close friends and allies who are urging them to import more low-wage and submissive migrants for jobs that would otherwise go to Americans who can vote in future elections, according to Business Insider. On February 10, BusinessInsider.com described the “Make America Wealthy Again” [MAWA] lobbying campaign: “Trump as a businessman understands that if he doesn’t have 200 [H-2A visa worker] guys cutting the grass at his golf courses, then they don’t look right, and people won’t want to play golf there,” says Cristina Antelo, the founding principal at Ferox Strategies, a lobbying firm that counts the National Retail Federation, Walmart, and the tobacco giant Reynolds America among its clients. “There’s a way to get to Trump and make him realize that. How many businesses does he need to hear from before he’s like, ‘Crap, I really am going to paralyze the entire US labor market if I do this’?” The MAWA plan is to apply pressure on business allies in Trump’s inner circle, rather than on the president directly, and to steer clear of Stephen Miller, the administration’s most outspoken anti-immigration hard-liner. “Stephen Miller won’t ever be convinced. Forget that,” says a lobbyist from a prominent trade association. “But Trump can be convinced not to screw over fellow businesspeople. Miller isn’t the only dude who has Trump’s ear.” The campaign is called “Make America Wealthy Again,” said Business Insider, because it is”designed to appeal to Trump and his business-minded allies.” The headline is “Make America Wealthy Again: Inside corporate America’s ‘quiet’ campaign to change Trump’s mind on mass deportations.” The drive is also submerging congressional legislators under pro-migration voices and advocates, according to the article: In addition, lobbyists have already begun reaching out to members of Congress and their staffs — both on Capitol Hill and in their districts back home — via phone, Zoom, and in-person meetings. Several lobbyists describe a campaign of “shock and awe,” one that will seek to apply “1,000 points of pressure” to GOP members of Congress who understand that immigrants are willing to take low-paying, high-risk jobs that are shunned by most Americans. Among those being targeted is Rep. Glenn Thompson of Pennsylvania, who chairs the House Agriculture Committee. The campaign is a direct threat to Trump’s delicate coalition of businesses and employees, investors and families. A power grab by one faction may break the coalition — just as President Joe Biden’s presidency was quietly wrecked by his powerful alliance of pro-migration West Coast investors. The same pro-migration skew crashed the career and retirement plans of Canada’s Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau. It also smashed the career of Prime Minister Rishi Sunak in the United Kingdom. In the United States, Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) twice lost the Majority Leader post because of his support for migration in 2014 and 2024. Outside Washington, a vast number of ordinary employees and family voters are increasingly opposed to illegal migration, and they carried Trump to victory — will help elect his successor in 2028. Moreover, many of the high-turnout voters needed in the off-year elections are increasingly opposed to the legalized inflow of white-collar Indian migrants via the H-1B and other visa programs. The H-1B program keeps roughly 730,000 foreign graduates in a wide variety of starter and experienced jobs throughout the Fortune 500. Without the H-1B program, those jobs would supercharge another generation of expert, outspoken, and innovative Americans in the leading edge of the U.S. economy. Overall, at least 1.6 million foreign graduates hold white-collar jobs via a variety of uncapped visa programs, such as the J-1, L-1, OPT, E-2, H4EAD, TN, and the H-1B program. Most of the visa workers graduate from low-grade universities, and many are chosen by lottery, so exploding the lobbyists’ claim that they are “highly skilled.” They cannot work as professionals because many are hired by foreign-born managers and all know they can be fired and sent home if they disagree with top managers. Many white-collar illegal migrants also hide in the growing workforce of migrant subcontractors. The result is a growing cascade of high-tech failures and disappointments in American companies and research centers. Those counterproductive programs have pushed millions of American college graduates out of good careers in technology, healthcare, management, and many other professions, and have crippled the innovation and flexibility of the U.S. tech sector. Other countries that also have tried to solve structural problems by importing migrants — Germany, Canada, and the United Kingdom — have also quickly fallen behind. In contrast, young Chinese scientists and their companies have quickly earned leading roles in manufacturing technology, artificial intelligence, the auto sector, 5g communications gear, and drug development. The “MAWA” phrase is an elitist version of Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan. Trump’s campaign slogan is only half of what Americans heard — yet many voters also heard him say “Make Americans Great Again” — not just America. If Trump resists pro-migration pressure from his friends, deputies, and donors, he may create a great America for Americans when a “tight labor” economy forces CEOs and investors to grow productivity, raise wages, risk more trade, and tolerate more innovation, as Blackrock CEO Larry Fink argues. But Trump is already zig-zagging under lobbying pressure from people such as Elon Musk. On December 28, for example, Musk slammed voters who oppose his use of the H-1B program to outsource U.S. jobs to India, saying: “Take a big step back and FUCK YOURSELF in the face. I will go to war on this issue the likes of which you cannot possibly comprehend.” On Sunday, February 9, for example, Trump again touted a misleading article that defended the H-1B visa program which has been used since 1990 to push millions of American graduates — and their families — out of good careers. The Wall Street Journal article echoed Mayorkas as claimed “U.S. companies find it crucial … And [because] one way to reduce illegal immigration is to allow more legal pathways to meet the needs of the U.S. economy.” Trump has yet to issue a formal policy statement on the increasingly unpopular inflow of white-collar visa workers. But he may be forced to show his cards this week when he meets with India’s Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, who is expected to demand more Indian immigration in exchange for U.S. exports to India.

Title: Bitcoin May See Gains from Soft U.S. CPI, Major Risk-On Surge in BTC Appears Unlikely
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/02/12/bitcoin-may-see-gains-from-soft-u-s-cpi-major-risk-on-surge-in-btc-appears-unlikely
Time Published: 2025-02-12T06:45:41Z
Full Content:
A soft U.S. inflation report later Wednesday will likely bode well for risk assets, including bitcoin (BTC). But those expecting bullish fireworks may be disappointed. The Labor Department will publish January's consumer price index (CPI) report on Wednesday at 13:30 UTC. It's expected to show that the cost of living increased by 0.3% month-on-month in January, slowing down from December's 0.4% rise, according to Reuters estimates tracked by FXStreet. The annualized figure is expected to match December's 2.9% reading. The core inflation, which strips out the volatile food and energy component, is forecast to have risen to 0.3% month-over-month from 0.2%, resulting in an annualized reading of 3.1%, down from December's 3.2%. Lower-than-expected data, particularly the core figure, will likely bolster expectations for further Federal Reserve (Fed) interest rate cuts, which could lead to lower Treasury yields and a weaker dollar index, ultimately boosting demand for riskier assets. According to CME's FedWatch tool, the market currently estimates a 54% chance that the Fed will either cut interest rates once or not at all this year. While a potential adjustment in Fed rate cuts could lift BTC, it is unlikely to be the sole catalyst for a breakout from the ongoing consolidation between $90,000 and $110,000. This is due to forward-looking market metrics indicating higher inflation in the coming months amid trade war fears, suggesting that the Fed may have a limited window to implement aggressive rate cuts. Data tracked by Mott Capital Management shows that two-year inflation swaps have climbed to nearly 2.8%, the highest since early 2023. The five-year swap is exhibiting a similar trend. Higher inflation swaps indicate that the market is expecting inflation rates to rise in the future, prompting investors to pay a higher premium to protect themselves against potential purchasing power loss by entering into swap contracts tied to CPI. In other words, the ongoing uptick in these metrics indicate that the progress in inflation toward the Fed's 2% target has stalled, and price pressures are likely to increase over the coming years, probably due to Trump's tariffs. Plus, some investment banks believe a soft January CPI reading won't see the Fed move away from its hawkish rate guidance. In his testimony to Congress Tuesday, Chairman Jerome Powell said the central bank is in no hurry to cut rates. "We don’t expect that progress on inflation will be enough to prompt additional interest rate cuts from the Fed this year," RBC's weekly note said, adding that January's report will show limited easing in price pressures. BlackRock said the persistent services inflation will keep the Fed from cutting rates. "We get U.S. CPI for January this week. Even as December’s CPI report showed signs of inflation pressures easing, wage growth remains above the level that would allow inflation to recede back to the Federal Reserve’s 2% target, in our view. We see persistent services inflation forcing the Fed to keep rates higher for longer," BlackRock said. Lastly, BTC may move closer to the lower end of its $90K-$110K trading range should the CPI print hotter than expected.

The trio's collaboration, which was detailed by the MoonPay President Keith Grossman on the ”When Shift Happens” podcast, required MoonPay CEO Ivan Soto-Wright to “sign away his life” and the company to “promise” it had no liens on its reserve funds. “The volumes were just gigantic,” Grossman said, “All of the liquidity that we use to sort of wire the crypto was locked in BlackRock accounts in a traditional finance sort of manner… and it's Saturday.” How to borrow $160m in $USDC on a holiday weekend @KeithGrossman, president of enterprise at @Moonpay, reveals the crazy story behind how he managed to borrow $160m with @novogratz and @bgarlinghouse’s help in order to make sure the $TRUMP launch would succeed… And the… pic.twitter.com/8zKugL2idN — MR SHIFT 🦁 (@KevinWSHPod) February 11, 2025 The crypto funds it did have handy were being used up rapidly thanks to the Trump meme coin team’s direction that users could use mobile meme coin trading app, Moonshot, for which MoonPay is the exclusive crypto payments provider. Moonshot simplifies the meme coin buying process, allowing users to sign up with an email address, and allowing them to fund their accounts with credit or debit cards. The app eschews the complexities that crypto novices may face with trading on-chain via decentralized exchanges, making it an ideal option for newcomers. Therefore, when new users were looking to buy the TRUMP token on the app, they were exchanging their funds for MoonPay’s crypto reserves, notably stablecoin USDC, which was then used to purchase Trump’s meme coin on the Solana blockchain. If the company didn't have the liquidity to continue facilitating purchases of the token, then new consumers—of which MoonPay says it onboarded 750,000 of during the week of the TRUMP launch—may not have been able to gain access to the token. That may have hindered the token’s rapid growth in the early days, and impacted other MoonPay users as well. Grossman said the app would’ve said, “Sorry, doesn’t work,” had MoonPay run out of funds. To avoid the issue, Grossman said that he and Soto-Wright worked with MoonPay CFO Mouna Siala to forecast the amount of funds it would require, with the initial estimate of $50 million quickly doubling to $100 million after reevaluating the token’s growth in the first 24 hours. With its reserves locked in traditional financial systems, Grossman said he texted Galaxy’s Mike Novogratz, and after a brief conversation, a loan was agreed upon and underway, forcing MoonPay’s teams to scramble on paperwork while verifying it had the funds to pay back a loan thanks to a connection through BlackRock. But the $100 million wasn’t enough. As demand continued to surge for TRUMP the following day, Grossman said that MoonPay turned to Ripple Labs CEO Brad Garlinghouse. “We underestimated the demand of this Trump token,” the MoonPay team told Garlinghouse, per Grossman. The Ripple chief agreed to help if MoonPay could get Novogratz to agree to the arrangement, given the previous deal in place—and ultimately, Grossman said, the additional $60 million was sent by Ripple to Galaxy, and then ultimately transferred to MoonPay. As traditional financial players came online in Europe and the United States on the following Monday and Tuesday, MoonPay was able to reestablish access to its funds, paying back its loans in full by Tuesday afternoon according to Grossman. The TRUMP token saw more than $20 billion in trading volume on average across its first five days after launch, according to data from CoinGecko, growing quickly to a fully diluted valuation of more than $73 billion in less than 48 hours. In the days after its launch, Trump’s meme coin gained spot listings from notable centralized exchanges like Binance and Coinbase, further aiding the ability for inexperienced users to gain access to the token. A MoonPay representative confirmed to Decrypt that Grossman’s telling of the situation was accurate, though representatives from Galaxy and Ripple did not immediately reply to Decrypt’s requests for comment. TRUMP is now trading at $15.37, down more than 79% from its all time high.

Title: Bitcoin Reserve proposal: Florida and North Carolina eye crypto for state treasuries

Florida and North Carolina lead U.S. states in Bitcoin adoption with Senate Bill 550. Lawmakers aim to allocate public funds into Bitcoin. As discussions about a Strategic Bitcoin [BTC] Reserve gain traction in the U.S., several states are already exploring ways to integrate Bitcoin into their financial systems. Florida is emerging as a frontrunner, with lawmakers advancing Senate Bill 550, aimed at incorporating Bitcoin into the state’s public investment strategy. Introduced by Senator Joe Gruters, the bill seeks to authorize Florida to allocate up to 10% of specific public funds into Bitcoin. This positions Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and a means of increasing financial autonomy. The Florida Bill SB 550 proposal noted, “Throughout its history, Bitcoin has greatly risen in value and is becoming more widely accepted as an international medium of exchange, and countries around the world, including the United States, hold Bitcoin within their treasury departments […] The bill further noted, Bitcoin is viewed as a hedge against inflation by sovereign nations and prominent investment advisors, including BlackRock, Fidelity, and Franklin Templeton […] The state should have access to tools such as Bitcoin to protect against inflation.” If enacted, the legislation would empower the state’s Chief Financial Officer to manage Bitcoin holdings through qualified custodians, exchange-traded products, or direct ownership. Beyond its potential economic benefits, the initiative signals a broader shift toward Bitcoin adoption at the state level, reinforcing its role as a viable asset. Florida isn’t alone in its Bitcoin push, as interest in cryptocurrency adoption is growing beyond U.S. borders. North Carolina and South Dakota are also actively exploring Bitcoin investments, joining a growing list of states considering digital asset reserves. In North Carolina, the House Speaker’s staff recently engaged with industry advocate Dan Spuller, who asserted that the state aims to secure the “top spot” in Bitcoin reserves. Meanwhile, South Dakota Representative Logan Manhart is pushing for legislative action, emphasizing that “now is one of the few chances government has at being proactive.” Hence, with at least 18 states currently assessing Bitcoin investments, the momentum for state-level adoption of cryptocurrency continues to build. That being said, a recent Reuters report highlights a surge in crypto usage across South America, particularly in Brazil, where digital assets are playing an increasingly prominent role in financial transactions. Gabriel Galipolo, Brazil’s Central Bank Chief, noted that the country has witnessed a significant rise in cryptocurrency adoption over the past three years, with stablecoins emerging as the preferred choice for payments. While this reflects a shift toward decentralized financial systems, it also raises concerns among regulators regarding oversight and financial stability. Speaking at an event in Mexico City, Galipolo emphasized the need for a balanced regulatory framework to address these challenges while fostering innovation in the digital asset space. He said, “Most of that is to buy things and to shop things from abroad. [This] maintains some kind of opaque vision for taxation or for money laundering.” Thus, as the momentum for state-backed Bitcoin reserves gains traction, Utah is emerging as one of the top states in passing formal legislation on the matter. In fact, Dennis Porter, CEO of Satoshi Act Fund, recently suggested that Utah could be the first state to successfully implement such a policy. Additionally, in a discussion with “Simply Bitcoin” and Senator Cynthia Lummis, Porter revealed that 11 states have already introduced bills to establish strategic Bitcoin reserves, with expectations that this number could rise to 15 by year-end. This growing interest underscores a broader shift toward Bitcoin’s role in state financial strategies, signaling a potential wave of adoption that could reshape traditional investment models across the U.S. Disclaimer: AMBCrypto's content is meant to be informational in nature and should not be interpreted as investment advice.

Ireland head coach Scott Bemand has named a 40-player extended squad ahead of the 2025 Women’s Six Nations which gets under way next month. Ireland will kick-off their Championship in Belfast on March 22nd, hosting France at Kingspan Stadium. Bemand has included eight uncapped players in the squad, including Sophie Barett, Jane Neill, Beth Buttimer and Jane Clohessy who impressed for the Ireland under-20s last season. Making the jump to senior from the Ireland under-18s panel is Alma Atagamen, while Amy Larn, Katie Heffernan and Caitriona Finn round out the uncapped contingent. Last season’s co-captain Sam Monaghan misses out through injury. “We’re delighted to select a really strong blend of 40 players to assemble and prepare for the start of the Guinness Women’s Six Nations, while also building towards Rugby World Cup 2025,” said Bemand, announcing the squad on Tuesday. “We’ll come together in Dublin next Monday and reconnect as a group, laying the foundations for the opportunities ahead. “Following on from successes during the WXV1 campaign in Vancouver, we have been impressed by the hard work and application of the players as they have returned to club action in recent months. “The focus and determination of players as they’ve attacked Celtic Challenge training with the Clovers and Wolfhounds has been particularly pleasing, and a number of players have earned their opportunity in National Camp off the back of those performances as we grow our wave. “We showed positive growth and evolution over the course of 2024 and the group are excited to get back in together to continue that work as we look towards the opening game against France in Belfast, which will provide a big challenge for us but we’re relishing the opportunity to perform in green while taking the home support along with us.” Forwards (22): Alma Atagamen (Balbriggan RFC)* Aoife Wafer (Blackrock College RFC/Leinster) Beth Buttimer (UL Bohemian RFC)* Brittany Hogan (Old Belvedere RFC/Ulster) Christy Haney (Blackrock College RFC/Leinster) Claire Boles (Railway Union RFC/Ulster) Cliodhna Moloney (Exeter Chiefs) Deirbhile Nic a Bháird (Old Belvedere RFC/Munster) Dorothy Wall (Exeter Chiefs/Munster) Edel McMahon (Exeter Chiefs/Connacht) Erin King (Old Belvedere RFC) Fiona Tuite (Old Belvedere RFC/Ulster) Grace Moore (Trailfinders Women/IQ Rugby) Jane Clohessy (UL Bohemian RFC/Munster)* Jane Neill (Old Belvedere RFC/Leinster)* Linda Djougang (Old Belvedere RFC/Leinster) Neve Jones (Gloucester-Hartpury) Niamh O’Dowd (Old Belvedere RFC/Leinster) Ruth Campbell (Old Belvedere RFC/Leinster) Sadhbh McGrath (Cooke RFC/Ulster) Siobhán McCarthy (Worcester Warriors/Munster) Sophie Barrett (Railway Union RFC/Ulster)* Backs (18): Amee-Leigh Costigan (Railway Union RFC/Munster) Amy Larn (Athy RFC)* Anna McGann (Railway Union RFC) Aoibheann Reilly (Blackrock College RFC/Connacht) Aoife Dalton (Old Belvedere RFC/Leinster) Béibhinn Parsons (Blackrock College RFC/Connacht) Caitríona Finn (UL Bohemian RFC/Munster)* Dannah O’Brien (Old Belvedere RFC/Leinster) Emily Lane (Blackrock College RFC) Enya Breen (Blackrock College RFC/Munster) Eve Higgins (Railway Union RFC) Katie Corrigan (Old Belvedere RFC) Katie Heffernan (Railway Union RFC/Leinster)* Méabh Deely (Blackrock College RFC/Connacht) Molly Scuffil-McCabe (Leinster) Nicole Fowley (Galwegians RFC/Connacht) Stacey Flood (Railway Union RFC) Vicky Elmes Kinlan (Wicklow RFC) *uncapped players March 22nd: Ireland v France, Kingspan Stadium, Belfast – 1pm March 30th: Italy v Ireland, Stadio Sergio Lanfrachi, Parma – 3pm April 12th: Ireland v England, Virgin Media Park, Cork – 4.45pm April 20th: Wales v Ireland, Rodney Parade, Newport – 3pm April 26th: Scotland v Ireland, Hive Stadium, Edinburgh – 12.15pm Sign up to the Irish Times weekly rugby digest for the view from the press box with Gerry Thornley © 2025 The Irish Times DAC
