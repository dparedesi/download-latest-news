Clontarf returned to winning ways by travelling to Cork and avenging last season’s epic semi-final defeat with a 20-16 win over the champions Constitution. Con led 13-6 at the break thanks to a try by Irish Sevens winger Sean French, but Clontarf stormed back in the second half through tries by centre Tadhg Bird and Leinster academy winger Aitzol Arenzana-King. Shock of the day was at Lakelands Park where City of Armagh secured a last gasp 30-26 win. Terenure had not lost at home in over a year and had beaten each of the other “big four”. But Armagh roared into a 23-5 interval lead, Kyle Faloon kicking three penalties and converting Dylan Nelson’s try in addition to a penalty try. Terenure responded with three converted tries by Craig Adams (his second), Harrison Brewer and Henry McErlean, but Armagh went to the corner for hooker Jonny Morton to burrow over. Ballynahinch moved into second with a 33-7 win at home to Garryowen, securing a bonus point by half time before a second try by another ex-Irish Sevens winger Zac Ward. St Mary’s also secured a bonus pint by half time in UCD through tries by Leandro Ramirez, Dan Goggin and Jack Nelson (two) en route to a 29-21 win which moved them above Terenure ahead of the sides’ first derby in seven seasons at Templeville Road a fortnight hence. Young Munster also had a bonus point by the interval through tries by Manuel Covella, Jake O’Riordan, Christian Foley and Hubert Gilvarry, and another by Stephen McLoughlin, converted by Argentinian Julian Leszczynski, had them 36-7 ahead before a late rally by Lansdowne. In the 2B summit meeting at Corinthian Park the young home side led 14-0 through tries by Orin Burke and John Devine, the second created by Sean Naughton’s break and offload, but Instonians led at half time through unconverted tries by Bradley McNamara, Ian Whitten and Schalk van der Merwe, two conversions hitting the upright. After a red card for the 37-year-old Whitten, eldest of four Instonians’ siblings, Corinthians’ late siege led to centre Tom Waters crashing over for a 21-15 win. It was just a third defeat in 41 games for “Inst”, and the second in that run by Corinthians. In 2B neighbours Galwegians lost 26-24 in Malone, a fifth defeat by two points or one, leaving them winless with six bonus points and a points difference of minus seven.

Title: BlackRock Makes History With 400,000 Bitcoin (BTC)

U.Today - BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) has reached a new milestone in its Bitcoin holdings, with a total of over 400,000 BTC. Right now, the hedge fund's holdings are valued at around $26.98 billion, with a total of 403,725 BTC. This big accumulation comes as the asset management giant bought another 34,085 BTC over the past two weeks, which is estimated to be worth about $2.3 billion, reports Lookonchain. The ongoing inflows into Bitcoin ETFs are helping BlackRock to grow its presence in the cryptocurrency market, making the firm a dominant force. This shows that more and more, Bitcoin ETFs are becoming a big way for institutions to own BTC. As the company increases its holdings, some people think that Bitcoin's future might change. Many are already projecting a sort of Bitcoin wars in the future, making dystopian predictions that BlackRock will eventually push for the fork of the original BTC chain and then promote its own forked chain as the real one, using all its massive resources to do so. It does not sound like something impossible, but in the current realm it seems more like a conspiracy theory. Such a rapid accumulation of Bitcoin has people wondering where BlackRock will draw the line in its pursuit of dominance in the cryptocurrency market. On the other hand, the financial behemoth faces challenges to its influence from other significant stakeholders in the Bitcoin space, including figures like Michael Saylor with MicroStrategy's Bitcoin holdings, mining entities, early adopters and millions of individual investors who form a large and decentralized market presence. Whether they will be able to present a solid opposition to BlackRock is another question however. This article was originally published on U.Today

Title: Zelensky the Lying War Criminal Tries to Create World War III

Skip to comments. Posted on 10/27/2024 9:30:39 AM PDT by delta7 world into World War III. He actually suggested he be given nuclear weapons if not allowed to join NATO. I have had employees both in Kyiv and Donetsk, and the sad part about this is they have lost their country, and for what? I warned them that he was dishonest and had been constantly lying and trying to manipulate the world. He intentionally dresses as if he is in the military, no matter what he attends. He thinks this is a psychological ploy to get him never-ending money constantly. The only way to world peace is to arrest this clown, and he should be in prison for the rest of his life without parole. Zelensky lied to get into office and pretended to be Christian, even baptizing g his two children. He promised peace to win, and my sources in Kiev swear the election was rigged. He promised peace, and has done everything put what he promised and then declared Martial Law so he does not have to stand for election every again as long as he can keep this war going. Heis VICTORY PLAN was nothing but to conquer and destroy Russia. He then suddenly became Jewish to select the fact that he was a Neo-Nazi and used to joke on stage about confiscating assets from Jews and Russians which he classified as the same. Friends in Israel do not consider him Jewish and he was pushing his claimed Jewish heritage and then asking for money implying this was vaguely connected to exterminating the Jews. The Pandora Papers revealed that Zelensky also had secret hidden offshore accounts along with all the other corrupt Ukrainian politicians. He had the audacity to claim that they were offshore protecting him against pro-Russian forces. In truth, these offshore accounts pre-dated him becoming president. Sources in Ukraine also claim that he was drafted and never showed up for military service. warned that if Zelensky were assassinated, he would be by a Ukrainian. He has destroyed his own country hoping to make a fortune on its reconstruction. Farmland is now bought by Blackrock, and the list of corruption is endless. Zelensky is looking for hundreds of billions to rebuild Ukraine and has the audacity to claim this will be the biggest investment project for Europe in modern history. The day before Russia came to the aid of the Donbas in this civil war that Kiev started on the alleged orders of Victoria Nuland, to ensure Putin would cross the border, he declared that Ukraine would rearm with nuclear weapons. That was the final straw; Putin even noted that in his address to Russia. It was not any different than the JFK and the Cuban Missile Crisis. The Washington Post found out that Zelensky knew when Russia would cross the border and did not warn his people. Like Hamas, he wanted civilians to be killed so he could blame Russia. When asked why he did not warn his people, he said it would have cost him $7 billion dollars. That is a war criminal. It was the American Neocons who instructed the UNELECTED Kiev government to attack the Russians in the Donbas and call them terrorists because they, too, wanted to separate from the Ukrainians who hate Russians and were killing them on the streets of Odesa. Zelendky staged the entirely false claim that Russia just killed civilians in Bucha. I have seen footage of pretend bodies with no visible blood lying in the streets, and as the car passed, they got up. There was no evidence of any such massacre. You have to understand that creating false flags is the #1 occupation of Ukraine. On March 31, 2022, the mayor of Bucha was joyful in announcing that the settlement had been liberated. He does not talk about any corpses on the roads and the terrible destruction of mass graves. It was two days later when suddenly photos and videos of people lying along the road appeared and horrendous stories about hundreds of dead being thrown in mass graves. These reports did not surface until two days after the Russians left. The Ukrainians were staging another false flag. Why did the mayor appear joyous and make no mention at first of these atrocities? This is why the West simply claimed there was no evidence and hid this was yet another Ukrainian False Flag trying to start World War III. Any Western Politician who votes for anything to support Ukraine should be charged with treason. Zelensky tried to claim Russia attacked Poland to start World War III. The evidence shows it was Ukraine that attacked Poland and tried to claim it was Russia. My RELIABLE sources insisted that it was Ukrainians who shot down the Malaysia fight and tried to blame the Russians. That was all covered up, and they blamed Russians in the Donbas. The West simply wants to destroy Russia. This is why Merkel lied to Putin and falsely negotiated the Minsk Agreement to buy time for Ukraine to build an army. This has been on the agenda for decades, and the fall of communism never changed that policy. They will do the same with China. In truth, this is Ukrainians invading the Russian territory where Russians have lived for centuries. The propaganda has flipped this completely around, claiming Putin was invading Ukraine when they began this civil war in 2014 and launched the first attacks on the Donbas. The treatment of Polish, Jews, and Russians during WWII even horrified the German Nazis. Why would Poland ever support Ukraine can only be that its leaders are told what to say and do by those behind NATO seeking World War III. The Polish people should wake up, for they will be the next to be thrown on this altar of geopolitical sacrifice. The Polish Association of Memory of Victims of Crimes of Ukrainian Nationalists documented 135 methods of torture and murder practiced by Ukrainian Nazis. Poland officially called the Ukrainian actions genocide. The Ukrainians have been protected by the CIA for decades ONLY because they hated Russians. They continue to protect the Ukrainian Nazis only because they are waging war against Russia. No Ukrainian was ever prosecuted for war crimes that made the German Nazis look like amateurs. The Ukrainians were unprecedented in their war crimes during WWII, and the sheer outright cruelty has NEVER been addressed. They, above all, should have been hunted down more so than the Germans. The torture Ukrainians inflicted even on Polish and Hungarians, along with Russians and Jews, included: Running children through with stakes Cutting a person’s throat and pulling their tongue out through the hole Sawing a person’s torso in half with a carpenter’s saw Cutting open the belly of a woman in an advanced stage of pregnancy, removing the fetus, and replacing it with a live cat, before sewing up her abdomen. Cutting open a pregnant women’s abdomen and pouring in broken glass Nailing a small child to a door. There are numerous foreign soldiers who volunteered for Ukraine and then have returned shocked at the extent of the war crimes carried out by Ukrainians. You have no idea of the seething hatred of all Russian-speaking people in the Donbas or in Russia. A significant number of Ukrainians have no problem killing and torturing Russians. If you did your research, the extent of the cruelty of the Ukrainian Nazis even shocked the German Nazis. They would cut out a baby of a pregnant woman and so in a live cat. They killed countless people from Poland and the Russians as well as Jews. They do not teach what the Ukrainian Nazis did in Ukraine because it was too horrible. One report stated: “Some Ukrainian educators believe the Holocaust is not an appropriate topic for teaching because in a Holocaust course a professor would need to let Ukrainian students know that some Jews were betrayed to the Nazis by Ukrainian neighbors. In addition, the OUN and UPA took part in the annihilation of Jews in western Ukraine, and this knowledge can shock young Ukrainians. ” id/pg 205 I have videos that are too horrible to show of Ukrainians torturing Russian soldiers today, nailing them to a cross, and then setting them on fire. There are numerous foreign soldiers returning who are totally disgusted by what they have witnessed in Ukraine. One reported that they simply shot all the Russian soldiers they captured. Nobody will tell the truth because as long as they hate Russia, then Russia’s enemy is the West’s friend. The Ukrainian Neo-Nazis have been the most ruthless people I have ever encountered in history. Add to that, Ukraine is the most corrupt country in Europe even declared by the IMF. In fact, they may be the most corrupt in the world. Zelensky has called on NATO to use nuclear weapons to destroy Russia. This is the typical ethnic hatred that has always consumed Ukraine. They were the neo-Naris who joined Hitler because they were still practicing ethnic cleansing. They hate anyone other than Ukrainian and have killed hundreds of thousands of Polish, Hungarians, Russians, and even Jews. “We’re not asking for nuclear weapons to be given to us,” he claimed yet he has been raising the nuclear argument before Russia crossed the border. Last week, Zelensky implied that obtaining nuclear weapons should be provided if his country couldn’t join NATO. “Either Ukraine has nuclear weapons, which will serve as its protection, or it must be part of some kind of alliance.” There is no mistake about Zelensky. The Ukrainian people had better rise up against this modern-day Hitler who still harbors ethnic cleansing. Putin warned that this would be a very “dangerous provocation.” Zelensky is an evil, greedy person who only thinks about destroying Russia, just as the Ukrainians were doing for Hitler. Putin further added: “I can say right away that Russia will not allow this to happen under any circumstances.” Zelensky claimed his Victory Plan was not nuclear, just the total destruction of Russia. Any Western leader who gives anything to Ukraine is an absolute traitor to his people. This will end in World War III, the West WILL LOSE, and the world’s financial capital will move to Beijing. Anyone who supports Zelensky should be dragged out of office ASAP.

I don’t care how corrupt or “Nazi” Ukraine is. That’s internal stuff. Ukraine never invaded anyone. However, there’s a third player here. And that’s NATO. NATO recklessly expanded to the east after the Cold War ended. Russia would have to see that as being provocative. Just as JFK saw Soviet missiles in Cuba as being provocative. The Ukraine/Russia war. Plenty of stupidity and arrogance to assign there. 10 posted on 10/27/2024 10:27:08 AM PDT by Leaning Right (The steal is real.)

Because the “America First” crowd was dead wrong in WW2. But they were dead right in WW1. America (and Europe) would have been much better off if Wilson had resisted the pressure to enter the war. So what to do? Perhaps we should be - at least initially - guided by: America goes not abroad, in search of monsters to destroy.

They killed countless people from Poland and the Russians as well as Jews. They do not teach what the Ukrainian Nazis did in Ukraine because it was too horrible. One report stated: “Some Ukrainian educators believe the Holocaust is not an appropriate topic for teaching because in a Holocaust course a professor would need to let Ukrainian students know that some Jews were betrayed to the Nazis by Ukrainian neighbors. In addition, the OUN and UPA took part in the annihilation of Jews in western Ukraine, and this knowledge can shock young Ukrainians. ” id/pg 205 I have videos that are too horrible to show of Ukrainians torturing Russian soldiers today, nailing them to a cross, and then setting them on fire. There are numerous foreign soldiers returning who are totally disgusted by what they have witnessed in Ukraine. One reported that they simply shot all the Russian soldiers they captured. Nobody will tell the truth because as long as they hate Russia, then Russia’s enemy is the West’s friend. The Ukrainian Neo-Nazis have been the most ruthless people I have ever encountered in history. Add to that, Ukraine is the most corrupt country in Europe even declared by the IMF. In fact, they may be the most corrupt in the world. Zelensky has called on NATO to use nuclear weapons to destroy Russia. This is the typical ethnic hatred that has always consumed Ukraine. They were the neo-Naris who joined Hitler because they were still practicing ethnic cleansing. They hate anyone other than Ukrainian and have killed hundreds of thousands of Polish, Hungarians, Russians, and even Jews. “We’re not asking for nuclear weapons to be given to us,” he claimed yet he has been raising the nuclear argument before Russia crossed the border. Last week, Zelensky implied that obtaining nuclear weapons should be provided if his country couldn’t join NATO. “Either Ukraine has nuclear weapons, which will serve as its protection, or it must be part of some kind of alliance.” There is no mistake about Zelensky. The Ukrainian people had better rise up against this modern-day Hitler who still harbors ethnic cleansing. Putin warned that this would be a very “dangerous provocation.” Zelensky is an evil, greedy person who only thinks about destroying Russia, just as the Ukrainians were doing for Hitler. Putin further added: “I can say right away that Russia will not allow this to happen under any circumstances.” Zelensky claimed his Victory Plan was not nuclear, just the total destruction of Russia. Any Western leader who gives anything to Ukraine is an absolute traitor to his people. This will end in World War III, the West WILL LOSE, and the world’s financial capital will move to Beijing. Anyone who supports Zelensky should be dragged out of office ASAP.

Because the “America First” crowd was dead wrong in WW2. But they were dead right in WW1. America (and Europe) would have been much better off if Wilson had resisted the pressure to enter the war. So what to do? Perhaps we should be - at least initially - guided by: America goes not abroad, in search of monsters to destroy.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Zelensky lied to get into office and pretended to be Christian, even baptizing g his two children. He promised peace to win, and my sources in Kiev swear the election was rigged. He promised peace, and has done everything put what he promised and then declared Martial Law so he does not have to stand for election every again as long as he can keep this war going. Heis VICTORY PLAN was nothing but to conquer and destroy Russia. He then suddenly became Jewish to select the fact that he was a Neo-Nazi and used to joke on stage about confiscating assets from Jews and Russians which he classified as the same. Friends in Israel do not consider him Jewish and he was pushing his claimed Jewish heritage and then asking for money implying this was vaguely connected to exterminating the Jews. The Pandora Papers revealed that Zelensky also had secret hidden offshore accounts along with all the other corrupt Ukrainian politicians. He had the audacity to claim that they were offshore protecting him against pro-Russian forces. In truth, these offshore accounts pre-dated him becoming president. Sources in Ukraine also claim that he was drafted and never showed up for military service. warned that if Zelensky were assassinated, he would be by a Ukrainian. He has destroyed his own country hoping to make a fortune on its reconstruction. Farmland is now bought by Blackrock, and the list of corruption is endless. Zelensky is looking for hundreds of billions to rebuild Ukraine and has the audacity to claim this will be the biggest investment project for Europe in modern history. The day before Russia came to the aid of the Donbas in this civil war that Kiev started on the alleged orders of Victoria Nuland, to ensure Putin would cross the border, he declared that Ukraine would rearm with nuclear weapons. That was the final straw; Putin even noted that in his address to Russia. It was not any different than the JFK and the Cuban Missile Crisis. The Washington Post found out that Zelensky knew when Russia would cross the border and did not warn his people. Like Hamas, he wanted civilians to be killed so he could blame Russia. When asked why he did not warn his people, he said it would have cost him $7 billion dollars. That is a war criminal. It was the American Neocons who instructed the UNELECTED Kiev government to attack the Russians in the Donbas and call them terrorists because they, too, wanted to separate from the Ukrainians who hate Russians and were killing them on the streets of Odesa. Zelendky staged the entirely false claim that Russia just killed civilians in Bucha. I have seen footage of pretend bodies with no visible blood lying in the streets, and as the car passed, they got up. There was no evidence of any such massacre. You have to understand that creating false flags is the #1 occupation of Ukraine. On March 31, 2022, the mayor of Bucha was joyful in announcing that the settlement had been liberated. He does not talk about any corpses on the roads and the terrible destruction of mass graves. It was two days later when suddenly photos and videos of people lying along the road appeared and horrendous stories about hundreds of dead being thrown in mass graves. These reports did not surface until two days after the Russians left. The Ukrainians were staging another false flag. Why did the mayor appear joyous and make no mention at first of these atrocities? This is why the West simply claimed there was no evidence and hid this was yet another Ukrainian False Flag trying to start World War III. Any Western Politician who votes for anything to support Ukraine should be charged with treason. Zelensky tried to claim Russia attacked Poland to start World War III. The evidence shows it was Ukraine that attacked Poland and tried to claim it was Russia. My RELIABLE sources insisted that it was Ukrainians who shot down the Malaysia fight and tried to blame the Russians. That was all covered up, and they blamed Russians in the Donbas. The West simply wants to destroy Russia. This is why Merkel lied to Putin and falsely negotiated the Minsk Agreement to buy time for Ukraine to build an army. This has been on the agenda for decades, and the fall of communism never changed that policy. They will do the same with China. In truth, this is Ukrainians invading the Russian territory where Russians have lived for centuries. The propaganda has flipped this completely around, claiming Putin was invading Ukraine when they began this civil war in 2014 and launched the first attacks on the Donbas. The treatment of Polish, Jews, and Russians during WWII even horrified the German Nazis. Why would Poland ever support Ukraine can only be that its leaders are told what to say and do by those behind NATO seeking World War III. The Polish people should wake up, for they will be the next to be thrown on this altar of geopolitical sacrifice. The Polish Association of Memory of Victims of Crimes of Ukrainian Nationalists documented 135 methods of torture and murder practiced by Ukrainian Nazis. Poland officially called the Ukrainian actions genocide. The Ukrainians have been protected by the CIA for decades ONLY because they hated Russians. They continue to protect the Ukrainian Nazis only because they are waging war against Russia. No Ukrainian was ever prosecuted for war crimes that made the German Nazis look like amateurs. The Ukrainians were unprecedented in their war crimes during WWII, and the sheer outright cruelty has NEVER been addressed. They, above all, should have been hunted down more so than the Germans. The torture Ukrainians inflicted even on Polish and Hungarians, along with Russians and Jews, included: Running children through with stakes Cutting a person’s throat and pulling their tongue out through the hole Sawing a person’s torso in half with a carpenter’s saw Cutting open the belly of a woman in an advanced stage of pregnancy, removing the fetus, and replacing it with a live cat, before sewing up her abdomen. Cutting open a pregnant women’s abdomen and pouring in broken glass Nailing a small child to a door. There are numerous foreign soldiers who volunteered for Ukraine and then have returned shocked at the extent of the war crimes carried out by Ukrainians. You have no idea of the seething hatred of all Russian-speaking people in the Donbas or in Russia. A significant number of Ukrainians have no problem killing and torturing Russians.

Friends in Israel do not consider him Jewish and he was pushing his claimed Jewish heritage and then asking for money implying this was vaguely connected to exterminating the Jews. The Pandora Papers revealed that Zelensky also had secret hidden offshore accounts along with all the other corrupt Ukrainian politicians. He had the audacity to claim that they were offshore protecting him against pro-Russian forces. In truth, these offshore accounts pre-dated him becoming president. Sources in Ukraine also claim that he was drafted and never showed up for military service. warned that if Zelensky were assassinated, he would be by a Ukrainian. He has destroyed his own country hoping to make a fortune on its reconstruction. Farmland is now bought by Blackrock, and the list of corruption is endless. Zelensky is looking for hundreds of billions to rebuild Ukraine and has the audacity to claim this will be the biggest investment project for Europe in modern history. The day before Russia came to the aid of the Donbas in this civil war that Kiev started on the alleged orders of Victoria Nuland, to ensure Putin would cross the border, he declared that Ukraine would rearm with nuclear weapons. That was the final straw; Putin even noted that in his address to Russia. It was not any different than the JFK and the Cuban Missile Crisis. The Washington Post found out that Zelensky knew when Russia would cross the border and did not warn his people. Like Hamas, he wanted civilians to be killed so he could blame Russia. When asked why he did not warn his people, he said it would have cost him $7 billion dollars. That is a war criminal. It was the American Neocons who instructed the UNELECTED Kiev government to attack the Russians in the Donbas and call them terrorists because they, too, wanted to separate from the Ukrainians who hate Russians and were killing them on the streets of Odesa. Zelendky staged the entirely false claim that Russia just killed civilians in Bucha. I have seen footage of pretend bodies with no visible blood lying in the streets, and as the car passed, they got up. There was no evidence of any such massacre. You have to understand that creating false flags is the #1 occupation of Ukraine. On March 31, 2022, the mayor of Bucha was joyful in announcing that the settlement had been liberated. He does not talk about any corpses on the roads and the terrible destruction of mass graves. It was two days later when suddenly photos and videos of people lying along the road appeared and horrendous stories about hundreds of dead being thrown in mass graves. These reports did not surface until two days after the Russians left. The Ukrainians were staging another false flag. Why did the mayor appear joyous and make no mention at first of these atrocities? This is why the West simply claimed there was no evidence and hid this was yet another Ukrainian False Flag trying to start World War III. Any Western Politician who votes for anything to support Ukraine should be charged with treason. Zelensky tried to claim Russia attacked Poland to start World War III. The evidence shows it was Ukraine that attacked Poland and tried to claim it was Russia. My RELIABLE sources insisted that it was Ukrainians who shot down the Malaysia fight and tried to blame the Russians. That was all covered up, and they blamed Russians in the Donbas. The West simply wants to destroy Russia. This is why Merkel lied to Putin and falsely negotiated the Minsk Agreement to buy time for Ukraine to build an army. This has been on the agenda for decades, and the fall of communism never changed that policy. They will do the same with China. In truth, this is Ukrainians invading the Russian territory where Russians have lived for centuries. The propaganda has flipped this completely around, claiming Putin was invading Ukraine when they began this civil war in 2014 and launched the first attacks on the Donbas. The treatment of Polish, Jews, and Russians during WWII even horrified the German Nazis. Why would Poland ever support Ukraine can only be that its leaders are told what to say and do by those behind NATO seeking World War III. The Polish people should wake up, for they will be the next to be thrown on this altar of geopolitical sacrifice. The Polish Association of Memory of Victims of Crimes of Ukrainian Nationalists documented 135 methods of torture and murder practiced by Ukrainian Nazis. Poland officially called the Ukrainian actions genocide. The Ukrainians have been protected by the CIA for decades ONLY because they hated Russians. They continue to protect the Ukrainian Nazis only because they are waging war against Russia. No Ukrainian was ever prosecuted for war crimes that made the German Nazis look like amateurs. The Ukrainians were unprecedented in their war crimes during WWII, and the sheer outright cruelty has NEVER been addressed. They, above all, should have been hunted down more so than the Germans. The torture Ukrainians inflicted even on Polish and Hungarians, along with Russians and Jews, included: Running children through with stakes Cutting a person’s throat and pulling their tongue out through the hole Sawing a person’s torso in half with a carpenter’s saw Cutting open the belly of a woman in an advanced stage of pregnancy, removing the fetus, and replacing it with a live cat, before sewing up her abdomen. Cutting open a pregnant women’s abdomen and pouring in broken glass Nailing a small child to a door. There are numerous foreign soldiers who volunteered for Ukraine and then have returned shocked at the extent of the war crimes carried out by Ukrainians. You have no idea of the seething hatred of all Russian-speaking people in the Donbas or in Russia. A significant number of Ukrainians have no problem killing and torturing Russians. If you did your research, the extent of the cruelty of the Ukrainian Nazis even shocked the German Nazis. They would cut out a baby of a pregnant woman and so in a live cat. They killed countless people from Poland and the Russians as well as Jews. They do not teach what the Ukrainian Nazis did in Ukraine because it was too horrible. One report stated: “Some Ukrainian educators believe the Holocaust is not an appropriate topic for teaching because in a Holocaust course a professor would need to let Ukrainian students know that some Jews were betrayed to the Nazis by Ukrainian neighbors. In addition, the OUN and UPA took part in the annihilation of Jews in western Ukraine, and this knowledge can shock young Ukrainians. ” id/pg 205 I have videos that are too horrible to show of Ukrainians torturing Russian soldiers today, nailing them to a cross, and then setting them on fire. There are numerous foreign soldiers returning who are totally disgusted by what they have witnessed in Ukraine. One reported that they simply shot all the Russian soldiers they captured. Nobody will tell the truth because as long as they hate Russia, then Russia’s enemy is the West’s friend. The Ukrainian Neo-Nazis have been the most ruthless people I have ever encountered in history. Add to that, Ukraine is the most corrupt country in Europe even declared by the IMF. In fact, they may be the most corrupt in the world. Zelensky has called on NATO to use nuclear weapons to destroy Russia. This is the typical ethnic hatred that has always consumed Ukraine. They were the neo-Naris who joined Hitler because they were still practicing ethnic cleansing. They hate anyone other than Ukrainian and have killed hundreds of thousands of Polish, Hungarians, Russians, and even Jews. “We’re not asking for nuclear weapons to be given to us,” he claimed yet he has been raising the nuclear argument before Russia crossed the border. Last week, Zelensky implied that obtaining nuclear weapons should be provided if his country couldn’t join NATO. “Either Ukraine has nuclear weapons, which will serve as its protection, or it must be part of some kind of alliance.” There is no mistake about Zelensky. The Ukrainian people had better rise up against this modern-day Hitler who still harbors ethnic cleansing. Putin warned that this would be a very “dangerous provocation.” Zelensky is an evil, greedy person who only thinks about destroying Russia, just as the Ukrainians were doing for Hitler. Putin further added: “I can say right away that Russia will not allow this to happen under any circumstances.” Zelensky claimed his Victory Plan was not nuclear, just the total destruction of Russia. Any Western leader who gives anything to Ukraine is an absolute traitor to his people. This will end in World War III, the West WILL LOSE, and the world’s financial capital will move to Beijing. Anyone who supports Zelensky should be dragged out of office ASAP.

It’s very much like WW1, just on a smaller scale. Christians desperately trying to kill Christians - and all over relatively minor issues. As you noted, if anyone can end this war it will be Donald Trump. And that’s why the next election is so critical.

Because the “America First” crowd was dead wrong in WW2. But they were dead right in WW1. America (and Europe) would have been much better off if Wilson had resisted the pressure to enter the war. So what to do? Perhaps we should be - at least initially - guided by: America goes not abroad, in search of monsters to destroy.

Because the “America First” crowd was dead wrong in WW2. But they were dead right in WW1. America (and Europe) would have been much better off if Wilson had resisted the pressure to enter the war. So what to do? Perhaps we should be - at least initially - guided by: America goes not abroad, in search of monsters to destroy.

He has destroyed his own country hoping to make a fortune on its reconstruction. Farmland is now bought by Blackrock, and the list of corruption is endless. Zelensky is looking for hundreds of billions to rebuild Ukraine and has the audacity to claim this will be the biggest investment project for Europe in modern history. The day before Russia came to the aid of the Donbas in this civil war that Kiev started on the alleged orders of Victoria Nuland, to ensure Putin would cross the border, he declared that Ukraine would rearm with nuclear weapons. That was the final straw; Putin even noted that in his address to Russia. It was not any different than the JFK and the Cuban Missile Crisis. The Washington Post found out that Zelensky knew when Russia would cross the border and did not warn his people. Like Hamas, he wanted civilians to be killed so he could blame Russia. When asked why he did not warn his people, he said it would have cost him $7 billion dollars. That is a war criminal. It was the American Neocons who instructed the UNELECTED Kiev government to attack the Russians in the Donbas and call them terrorists because they, too, wanted to separate from the Ukrainians who hate Russians and were killing them on the streets of Odesa. Zelendky staged the entirely false claim that Russia just killed civilians in Bucha. I have seen footage of pretend bodies with no visible blood lying in the streets, and as the car passed, they got up. There was no evidence of any such massacre. You have to understand that creating false flags is the #1 occupation of Ukraine. On March 31, 2022, the mayor of Bucha was joyful in announcing that the settlement had been liberated. He does not talk about any corpses on the roads and the terrible destruction of mass graves. It was two days later when suddenly photos and videos of people lying along the road appeared and horrendous stories about hundreds of dead being thrown in mass graves. These reports did not surface until two days after the Russians left. The Ukrainians were staging another false flag. Why did the mayor appear joyous and make no mention at first of these atrocities? This is why the West simply claimed there was no evidence and hid this was yet another Ukrainian False Flag trying to start World War III. Any Western Politician who votes for anything to support Ukraine should be charged with treason. Zelensky tried to claim Russia attacked Poland to start World War III. The evidence shows it was Ukraine that attacked Poland and tried to claim it was Russia. My RELIABLE sources insisted that it was Ukrainians who shot down the Malaysia fight and tried to blame the Russians. That was all covered up, and they blamed Russians in the Donbas. The West simply wants to destroy Russia. This is why Merkel lied to Putin and falsely negotiated the Minsk Agreement to buy time for Ukraine to build an army. This has been on the agenda for decades, and the fall of communism never changed that policy. They will do the same with China. In truth, this is Ukrainians invading the Russian territory where Russians have lived for centuries. The propaganda has flipped this completely around, claiming Putin was invading Ukraine when they began this civil war in 2014 and launched the first attacks on the Donbas. The treatment of Polish, Jews, and Russians during WWII even horrified the German Nazis. Why would Poland ever support Ukraine can only be that its leaders are told what to say and do by those behind NATO seeking World War III. The Polish people should wake up, for they will be the next to be thrown on this altar of geopolitical sacrifice. The Polish Association of Memory of Victims of Crimes of Ukrainian Nationalists documented 135 methods of torture and murder practiced by Ukrainian Nazis. Poland officially called the Ukrainian actions genocide. The Ukrainians have been protected by the CIA for decades ONLY because they hated Russians. They continue to protect the Ukrainian Nazis only because they are waging war against Russia. No Ukrainian was ever prosecuted for war crimes that made the German Nazis look like amateurs. The Ukrainians were unprecedented in their war crimes during WWII, and the sheer outright cruelty has NEVER been addressed. They, above all, should have been hunted down more so than the Germans. The torture Ukrainians inflicted even on Polish and Hungarians, along with Russians and Jews, included: Running children through with stakes Cutting a person’s throat and pulling their tongue out through the hole Sawing a person’s torso in half with a carpenter’s saw Cutting open the belly of a woman in an advanced stage of pregnancy, removing the fetus, and replacing it with a live cat, before sewing up her abdomen. Cutting open a pregnant women’s abdomen and pouring in broken glass Nailing a small child to a door. There are numerous foreign soldiers who volunteered for Ukraine and then have returned shocked at the extent of the war crimes carried out by Ukrainians. You have no idea of the seething hatred of all Russian-speaking people in the Donbas or in Russia. A significant number of Ukrainians have no problem killing and torturing Russians. If you did your research, the extent of the cruelty of the Ukrainian Nazis even shocked the German Nazis. They would cut out a baby of a pregnant woman and so in a live cat. They killed countless people from Poland and the Russians as well as Jews. They do not teach what the Ukrainian Nazis did in Ukraine because it was too horrible. One report stated: “Some Ukrainian educators believe the Holocaust is not an appropriate topic for teaching because in a Holocaust course a professor would need to let Ukrainian students know that some Jews were betrayed to the Nazis by Ukrainian neighbors. In addition, the OUN and UPA took part in the annihilation of Jews in western Ukraine, and this knowledge can shock young Ukrainians. ” id/pg 205 I have videos that are too horrible to show of Ukrainians torturing Russian soldiers today, nailing them to a cross, and then setting them on fire. There are numerous foreign soldiers returning who are totally disgusted by what they have witnessed in Ukraine. One reported that they simply shot all the Russian soldiers they captured. Nobody will tell the truth because as long as they hate Russia, then Russia’s enemy is the West’s friend. The Ukrainian Neo-Nazis have been the most ruthless people I have ever encountered in history. Add to that, Ukraine is the most corrupt country in Europe even declared by the IMF. In fact, they may be the most corrupt in the world. Zelensky has called on NATO to use nuclear weapons to destroy Russia. This is the typical ethnic hatred that has always consumed Ukraine. They were the neo-Naris who joined Hitler because they were still practicing ethnic cleansing. They hate anyone other than Ukrainian and have killed hundreds of thousands of Polish, Hungarians, Russians, and even Jews. “We’re not asking for nuclear weapons to be given to us,” he claimed yet he has been raising the nuclear argument before Russia crossed the border. Last week, Zelensky implied that obtaining nuclear weapons should be provided if his country couldn’t join NATO. “Either Ukraine has nuclear weapons, which will serve as its protection, or it must be part of some kind of alliance.” There is no mistake about Zelensky. The Ukrainian people had better rise up against this modern-day Hitler who still harbors ethnic cleansing. Putin warned that this would be a very “dangerous provocation.” Zelensky is an evil, greedy person who only thinks about destroying Russia, just as the Ukrainians were doing for Hitler. Putin further added: “I can say right away that Russia will not allow this to happen under any circumstances.” Zelensky claimed his Victory Plan was not nuclear, just the total destruction of Russia. Any Western leader who gives anything to Ukraine is an absolute traitor to his people. This will end in World War III, the West WILL LOSE, and the world’s financial capital will move to Beijing. Anyone who supports Zelensky should be dragged out of office ASAP.

I don’t care how corrupt or “Nazi” Ukraine is. That’s internal stuff. Ukraine never invaded anyone. However, there’s a third player here. And that’s NATO. NATO recklessly expanded to the east after the Cold War ended. Russia would have to see that as being provocative. Just as JFK saw Soviet missiles in Cuba as being provocative.

Because the “America First” crowd was dead wrong in WW2. But they were dead right in WW1. America (and Europe) would have been much better off if Wilson had resisted the pressure to enter the war. So what to do? Perhaps we should be - at least initially - guided by: America goes not abroad, in search of monsters to destroy.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson The Washington Post found out that Zelensky knew when Russia would cross the border and did not warn his people. Like Hamas, he wanted civilians to be killed so he could blame Russia. When asked why he did not warn his people, he said it would have cost him $7 billion dollars. That is a war criminal. It was the American Neocons who instructed the UNELECTED Kiev government to attack the Russians in the Donbas and call them terrorists because they, too, wanted to separate from the Ukrainians who hate Russians and were killing them on the streets of Odesa. Zelendky staged the entirely false claim that Russia just killed civilians in Bucha. I have seen footage of pretend bodies with no visible blood lying in the streets, and as the car passed, they got up. There was no evidence of any such massacre. You have to understand that creating false flags is the #1 occupation of Ukraine. On March 31, 2022, the mayor of Bucha was joyful in announcing that the settlement had been liberated. He does not talk about any corpses on the roads and the terrible destruction of mass graves. It was two days later when suddenly photos and videos of people lying along the road appeared and horrendous stories about hundreds of dead being thrown in mass graves. These reports did not surface until two days after the Russians left. The Ukrainians were staging another false flag. Why did the mayor appear joyous and make no mention at first of these atrocities? This is why the West simply claimed there was no evidence and hid this was yet another Ukrainian False Flag trying to start World War III. Any Western Politician who votes for anything to support Ukraine should be charged with treason. Zelensky tried to claim Russia attacked Poland to start World War III. The evidence shows it was Ukraine that attacked Poland and tried to claim it was Russia. My RELIABLE sources insisted that it was Ukrainians who shot down the Malaysia fight and tried to blame the Russians. That was all covered up, and they blamed Russians in the Donbas. The West simply wants to destroy Russia. This is why Merkel lied to Putin and falsely negotiated the Minsk Agreement to buy time for Ukraine to build an army. This has been on the agenda for decades, and the fall of communism never changed that policy. They will do the same with China. In truth, this is Ukrainians invading the Russian territory where Russians have lived for centuries. The propaganda has flipped this completely around, claiming Putin was invading Ukraine when they began this civil war in 2014 and launched the first attacks on the Donbas. The treatment of Polish, Jews, and Russians during WWII even horrified the German Nazis. Why would Poland ever support Ukraine can only be that its leaders are told what to say and do by those behind NATO seeking World War III. The Polish people should wake up, for they will be the next to be thrown on this altar of geopolitical sacrifice. The Polish Association of Memory of Victims of Crimes of Ukrainian Nationalists documented 135 methods of torture and murder practiced by Ukrainian Nazis. Poland officially called the Ukrainian actions genocide. The Ukrainians have been protected by the CIA for decades ONLY because they hated Russians. They continue to protect the Ukrainian Nazis only because they are waging war against Russia. No Ukrainian was ever prosecuted for war crimes that made the German Nazis look like amateurs. The Ukrainians were unprecedented in their war crimes during WWII, and the sheer outright cruelty has NEVER been addressed. They, above all, should have been hunted down more so than the Germans. The torture Ukrainians inflicted even on Polish and Hungarians, along with Russians and Jews, included: Running children through with stakes Cutting a person’s throat and pulling their tongue out through the hole Sawing a person’s torso in half with a carpenter’s saw Cutting open the belly of a woman in an advanced stage of pregnancy, removing the fetus, and replacing it with a live cat, before sewing up her abdomen. Cutting open a pregnant women’s abdomen and pouring in broken glass Nailing a small child to a door. There are numerous foreign soldiers who volunteered for Ukraine and then have returned shocked at the extent of the war crimes carried out by Ukrainians. You have no idea of the seething hatred of all Russian-speaking people in the Donbas or in Russia. A significant number of Ukrainians have no problem killing and torturing Russians. If you did your research, the extent of the cruelty of the Ukrainian Nazis even shocked the German Nazis. They would cut out a baby of a pregnant woman and so in a live cat. They killed countless people from Poland and the Russians as well as Jews. They do not teach what the Ukrainian Nazis did in Ukraine because it was too horrible. One report stated: “Some Ukrainian educators believe the Holocaust is not an appropriate topic for teaching because in a Holocaust course a professor would need to let Ukrainian students know that some Jews were betrayed to the Nazis by Ukrainian neighbors. In addition, the OUN and UPA took part in the annihilation of Jews in western Ukraine, and this knowledge can shock young Ukrainians. ” id/pg 205 I have videos that are too horrible to show of Ukrainians torturing Russian soldiers today, nailing them to a cross, and then setting them on fire. There are numerous foreign soldiers returning who are totally disgusted by what they have witnessed in Ukraine. One reported that they simply shot all the Russian soldiers they captured. Nobody will tell the truth because as long as they hate Russia, then Russia’s enemy is the West’s friend. The Ukrainian Neo-Nazis have been the most ruthless people I have ever encountered in history. Add to that, Ukraine is the most corrupt country in Europe even declared by the IMF. In fact, they may be the most corrupt in the world. Zelensky has called on NATO to use nuclear weapons to destroy Russia. This is the typical ethnic hatred that has always consumed Ukraine. They were the neo-Naris who joined Hitler because they were still practicing ethnic cleansing. They hate anyone other than Ukrainian and have killed hundreds of thousands of Polish, Hungarians, Russians, and even Jews. “We’re not asking for nuclear weapons to be given to us,” he claimed yet he has been raising the nuclear argument before Russia crossed the border. Last week, Zelensky implied that obtaining nuclear weapons should be provided if his country couldn’t join NATO. “Either Ukraine has nuclear weapons, which will serve as its protection, or it must be part of some kind of alliance.” There is no mistake about Zelensky. The Ukrainian people had better rise up against this modern-day Hitler who still harbors ethnic cleansing. Putin warned that this would be a very “dangerous provocation.” Zelensky is an evil, greedy person who only thinks about destroying Russia, just as the Ukrainians were doing for Hitler. Putin further added: “I can say right away that Russia will not allow this to happen under any circumstances.” Zelensky claimed his Victory Plan was not nuclear, just the total destruction of Russia. Any Western leader who gives anything to Ukraine is an absolute traitor to his people. This will end in World War III, the West WILL LOSE, and the world’s financial capital will move to Beijing. Anyone who supports Zelensky should be dragged out of office ASAP.

Because the “America First” crowd was dead wrong in WW2. But they were dead right in WW1. America (and Europe) would have been much better off if Wilson had resisted the pressure to enter the war. So what to do? Perhaps we should be - at least initially - guided by: America goes not abroad, in search of monsters to destroy.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Zelendky staged the entirely false claim that Russia just killed civilians in Bucha. I have seen footage of pretend bodies with no visible blood lying in the streets, and as the car passed, they got up. There was no evidence of any such massacre. You have to understand that creating false flags is the #1 occupation of Ukraine. On March 31, 2022, the mayor of Bucha was joyful in announcing that the settlement had been liberated. He does not talk about any corpses on the roads and the terrible destruction of mass graves. It was two days later when suddenly photos and videos of people lying along the road appeared and horrendous stories about hundreds of dead being thrown in mass graves. These reports did not surface until two days after the Russians left. The Ukrainians were staging another false flag. Why did the mayor appear joyous and make no mention at first of these atrocities? This is why the West simply claimed there was no evidence and hid this was yet another Ukrainian False Flag trying to start World War III. Any Western Politician who votes for anything to support Ukraine should be charged with treason. Zelensky tried to claim Russia attacked Poland to start World War III. The evidence shows it was Ukraine that attacked Poland and tried to claim it was Russia. My RELIABLE sources insisted that it was Ukrainians who shot down the Malaysia fight and tried to blame the Russians. That was all covered up, and they blamed Russians in the Donbas. The West simply wants to destroy Russia. This is why Merkel lied to Putin and falsely negotiated the Minsk Agreement to buy time for Ukraine to build an army. This has been on the agenda for decades, and the fall of communism never changed that policy. They will do the same with China. In truth, this is Ukrainians invading the Russian territory where Russians have lived for centuries. The propaganda has flipped this completely around, claiming Putin was invading Ukraine when they began this civil war in 2014 and launched the first attacks on the Donbas. The treatment of Polish, Jews, and Russians during WWII even horrified the German Nazis. Why would Poland ever support Ukraine can only be that its leaders are told what to say and do by those behind NATO seeking World War III. The Polish people should wake up, for they will be the next to be thrown on this altar of geopolitical sacrifice. The Polish Association of Memory of Victims of Crimes of Ukrainian Nationalists documented 135 methods of torture and murder practiced by Ukrainian Nazis. Poland officially called the Ukrainian actions genocide. The Ukrainians have been protected by the CIA for decades ONLY because they hated Russians. They continue to protect the Ukrainian Nazis only because they are waging war against Russia. No Ukrainian was ever prosecuted for war crimes that made the German Nazis look like amateurs. The Ukrainians were unprecedented in their war crimes during WWII, and the sheer outright cruelty has NEVER been addressed. They, above all, should have been hunted down more so than the Germans. The torture Ukrainians inflicted even on Polish and Hungarians, along with Russians and Jews, included: Running children through with stakes Cutting a person’s throat and pulling their tongue out through the hole Sawing a person’s torso in half with a carpenter’s saw Cutting open the belly of a woman in an advanced stage of pregnancy, removing the fetus, and replacing it with a live cat, before sewing up her abdomen. Cutting open a pregnant women’s abdomen and pouring in broken glass Nailing a small child to a door. There are numerous foreign soldiers who volunteered for Ukraine and then have returned shocked at the extent of the war crimes carried out by Ukrainians. You have no idea of the seething hatred of all Russian-speaking people in the Donbas or in Russia. A significant number of Ukrainians have no problem killing and torturing Russians. If you did your research, the extent of the cruelty of the Ukrainian Nazis even shocked the German Nazis. They would cut out a baby of a pregnant woman and so in a live cat. They killed countless people from Poland and the Russians as well as Jews. They do not teach what the Ukrainian Nazis did in Ukraine because it was too horrible. One report stated: “Some Ukrainian educators believe the Holocaust is not an appropriate topic for teaching because in a Holocaust course a professor would need to let Ukrainian students know that some Jews were betrayed to the Nazis by Ukrainian neighbors. In addition, the OUN and UPA took part in the annihilation of Jews in western Ukraine, and this knowledge can shock young Ukrainians. ” id/pg 205 I have videos that are too horrible to show of Ukrainians torturing Russian soldiers today, nailing them to a cross, and then setting them on fire. There are numerous foreign soldiers returning who are totally disgusted by what they have witnessed in Ukraine. One reported that they simply shot all the Russian soldiers they captured. Nobody will tell the truth because as long as they hate Russia, then Russia’s enemy is the West’s friend. The Ukrainian Neo-Nazis have been the most ruthless people I have ever encountered in history. Add to that, Ukraine is the most corrupt country in Europe even declared by the IMF. In fact, they may be the most corrupt in the world. Zelensky has called on NATO to use nuclear weapons to destroy Russia. This is the typical ethnic hatred that has always consumed Ukraine. They were the neo-Naris who joined Hitler because they were still practicing ethnic cleansing. They hate anyone other than Ukrainian and have killed hundreds of thousands of Polish, Hungarians, Russians, and even Jews. “We’re not asking for nuclear weapons to be given to us,” he claimed yet he has been raising the nuclear argument before Russia crossed the border. Last week, Zelensky implied that obtaining nuclear weapons should be provided if his country couldn’t join NATO. “Either Ukraine has nuclear weapons, which will serve as its protection, or it must be part of some kind of alliance.” There is no mistake about Zelensky. The Ukrainian people had better rise up against this modern-day Hitler who still harbors ethnic cleansing. Putin warned that this would be a very “dangerous provocation.” Zelensky is an evil, greedy person who only thinks about destroying Russia, just as the Ukrainians were doing for Hitler. Putin further added: “I can say right away that Russia will not allow this to happen under any circumstances.” Zelensky claimed his Victory Plan was not nuclear, just the total destruction of Russia. Any Western leader who gives anything to Ukraine is an absolute traitor to his people. This will end in World War III, the West WILL LOSE, and the world’s financial capital will move to Beijing. Anyone who supports Zelensky should be dragged out of office ASAP.

Last week, Zelensky implied that obtaining nuclear weapons should be provided if his country couldn’t join NATO. “Either Ukraine has nuclear weapons, which will serve as its protection, or it must be part of some kind of alliance.” There is no mistake about Zelensky. The Ukrainian people had better rise up against this modern-day Hitler who still harbors ethnic cleansing. Putin warned that this would be a very “dangerous provocation.” Zelensky is an evil, greedy person who only thinks about destroying Russia, just as the Ukrainians were doing for Hitler. Putin further added: “I can say right away that Russia will not allow this to happen under any circumstances.” Zelensky claimed his Victory Plan was not nuclear, just the total destruction of Russia. Any Western leader who gives anything to Ukraine is an absolute traitor to his people. This will end in World War III, the West WILL LOSE, and the world’s financial capital will move to Beijing. Anyone who supports Zelensky should be dragged out of office ASAP.

This is why the West simply claimed there was no evidence and hid this was yet another Ukrainian False Flag trying to start World War III. Any Western Politician who votes for anything to support Ukraine should be charged with treason. Zelensky tried to claim Russia attacked Poland to start World War III. The evidence shows it was Ukraine that attacked Poland and tried to claim it was Russia. My RELIABLE sources insisted that it was Ukrainians who shot down the Malaysia fight and tried to blame the Russians. That was all covered up, and they blamed Russians in the Donbas. The West simply wants to destroy Russia. This is why Merkel lied to Putin and falsely negotiated the Minsk Agreement to buy time for Ukraine to build an army. This has been on the agenda for decades, and the fall of communism never changed that policy. They will do the same with China. In truth, this is Ukrainians invading the Russian territory where Russians have lived for centuries. The propaganda has flipped this completely around, claiming Putin was invading Ukraine when they began this civil war in 2014 and launched the first attacks on the Donbas. The treatment of Polish, Jews, and Russians during WWII even horrified the German Nazis. Why would Poland ever support Ukraine can only be that its leaders are told what to say and do by those behind NATO seeking World War III. The Polish people should wake up, for they will be the next to be thrown on this altar of geopolitical sacrifice. The Polish Association of Memory of Victims of Crimes of Ukrainian Nationalists documented 135 methods of torture and murder practiced by Ukrainian Nazis. Poland officially called the Ukrainian actions genocide. The Ukrainians have been protected by the CIA for decades ONLY because they hated Russians. They continue to protect the Ukrainian Nazis only because they are waging war against Russia. No Ukrainian was ever prosecuted for war crimes that made the German Nazis look like amateurs. The Ukrainians were unprecedented in their war crimes during WWII, and the sheer outright cruelty has NEVER been addressed. They, above all, should have been hunted down more so than the Germans. The torture Ukrainians inflicted even on Polish and Hungarians, along with Russians and Jews, included: Running children through with stakes Cutting a person’s throat and pulling their tongue out through the hole Sawing a person’s torso in half with a carpenter’s saw Cutting open the belly of a woman in an advanced stage of pregnancy, removing the fetus, and replacing it with a live cat, before sewing up her abdomen. Cutting open a pregnant women’s abdomen and pouring in broken glass Nailing a small child to a door. There are numerous foreign soldiers who volunteered for Ukraine and then have returned shocked at the extent of the war crimes carried out by Ukrainians. You have no idea of the seething hatred of all Russian-speaking people in the Donbas or in Russia. A significant number of Ukrainians have no problem killing and torturing Russians. If you did your research, the extent of the cruelty of the Ukrainian Nazis even shocked the German Nazis. They would cut out a baby of a pregnant woman and so in a live cat. They killed countless people from Poland and the Russians as well as Jews. They do not teach what the Ukrainian Nazis did in Ukraine because it was too horrible. One report stated: “Some Ukrainian educators believe the Holocaust is not an appropriate topic for teaching because in a Holocaust course a professor would need to let Ukrainian students know that some Jews were betrayed to the Nazis by Ukrainian neighbors. In addition, the OUN and UPA took part in the annihilation of Jews in western Ukraine, and this knowledge can shock young Ukrainians. ” id/pg 205 I have videos that are too horrible to show of Ukrainians torturing Russian soldiers today, nailing them to a cross, and then setting them on fire. There are numerous foreign soldiers returning who are totally disgusted by what they have witnessed in Ukraine. One reported that they simply shot all the Russian soldiers they captured. Nobody will tell the truth because as long as they hate Russia, then Russia’s enemy is the West’s friend. The Ukrainian Neo-Nazis have been the most ruthless people I have ever encountered in history. Add to that, Ukraine is the most corrupt country in Europe even declared by the IMF. In fact, they may be the most corrupt in the world. Zelensky has called on NATO to use nuclear weapons to destroy Russia. This is the typical ethnic hatred that has always consumed Ukraine. They were the neo-Naris who joined Hitler because they were still practicing ethnic cleansing. They hate anyone other than Ukrainian and have killed hundreds of thousands of Polish, Hungarians, Russians, and even Jews. “We’re not asking for nuclear weapons to be given to us,” he claimed yet he has been raising the nuclear argument before Russia crossed the border.

Putin warned that this would be a very “dangerous provocation.” Zelensky is an evil, greedy person who only thinks about destroying Russia, just as the Ukrainians were doing for Hitler. Putin further added: “I can say right away that Russia will not allow this to happen under any circumstances.” Zelensky claimed his Victory Plan was not nuclear, just the total destruction of Russia. Any Western leader who gives anything to Ukraine is an absolute traitor to his people. This will end in World War III, the West WILL LOSE, and the world’s financial capital will move to Beijing. Anyone who supports Zelensky should be dragged out of office ASAP.

Because the “America First” crowd was dead wrong in WW2. But they were dead right in WW1. America (and Europe) would have been much better off if Wilson had resisted the pressure to enter the war. So what to do? Perhaps we should be - at least initially - guided by: America goes not abroad, in search of monsters to destroy.

This is why Merkel lied to Putin and falsely negotiated the Minsk Agreement to buy time for Ukraine to build an army. This has been on the agenda for decades, and the fall of communism never changed that policy. They will do the same with China. In truth, this is Ukrainians invading the Russian territory where Russians have lived for centuries. The propaganda has flipped this completely around, claiming Putin was invading Ukraine when they began this civil war in 2014 and launched the first attacks on the Donbas. The treatment of Polish, Jews, and Russians during WWII even horrified the German Nazis. Why would Poland ever support Ukraine can only be that its leaders are told what to say and do by those behind NATO seeking World War III. The Polish people should wake up, for they will be the next to be thrown on this altar of geopolitical sacrifice. The Polish Association of Memory of Victims of Crimes of Ukrainian Nationalists documented 135 methods of torture and murder practiced by Ukrainian Nazis. Poland officially called the Ukrainian actions genocide. The Ukrainians have been protected by the CIA for decades ONLY because they hated Russians. They continue to protect the Ukrainian Nazis only because they are waging war against Russia. No Ukrainian was ever prosecuted for war crimes that made the German Nazis look like amateurs. The Ukrainians were unprecedented in their war crimes during WWII, and the sheer outright cruelty has NEVER been addressed. They, above all, should have been hunted down more so than the Germans. The torture Ukrainians inflicted even on Polish and Hungarians, along with Russians and Jews, included: Running children through with stakes Cutting a person’s throat and pulling their tongue out through the hole Sawing a person’s torso in half with a carpenter’s saw Cutting open the belly of a woman in an advanced stage of pregnancy, removing the fetus, and replacing it with a live cat, before sewing up her abdomen. Cutting open a pregnant women’s abdomen and pouring in broken glass Nailing a small child to a door. There are numerous foreign soldiers who volunteered for Ukraine and then have returned shocked at the extent of the war crimes carried out by Ukrainians. You have no idea of the seething hatred of all Russian-speaking people in the Donbas or in Russia. A significant number of Ukrainians have no problem killing and torturing Russians. If you did your research, the extent of the cruelty of the Ukrainian Nazis even shocked the German Nazis. They would cut out a baby of a pregnant woman and so in a live cat. They killed countless people from Poland and the Russians as well as Jews. They do not teach what the Ukrainian Nazis did in Ukraine because it was too horrible. One report stated: “Some Ukrainian educators believe the Holocaust is not an appropriate topic for teaching because in a Holocaust course a professor would need to let Ukrainian students know that some Jews were betrayed to the Nazis by Ukrainian neighbors. In addition, the OUN and UPA took part in the annihilation of Jews in western Ukraine, and this knowledge can shock young Ukrainians. ” id/pg 205 I have videos that are too horrible to show of Ukrainians torturing Russian soldiers today, nailing them to a cross, and then setting them on fire. There are numerous foreign soldiers returning who are totally disgusted by what they have witnessed in Ukraine. One reported that they simply shot all the Russian soldiers they captured. Nobody will tell the truth because as long as they hate Russia, then Russia’s enemy is the West’s friend. The Ukrainian Neo-Nazis have been the most ruthless people I have ever encountered in history. Add to that, Ukraine is the most corrupt country in Europe even declared by the IMF. In fact, they may be the most corrupt in the world. Zelensky has called on NATO to use nuclear weapons to destroy Russia. This is the typical ethnic hatred that has always consumed Ukraine. They were the neo-Naris who joined Hitler because they were still practicing ethnic cleansing. They hate anyone other than Ukrainian and have killed hundreds of thousands of Polish, Hungarians, Russians, and even Jews. “We’re not asking for nuclear weapons to be given to us,” he claimed yet he has been raising the nuclear argument before Russia crossed the border.

Because the “America First” crowd was dead wrong in WW2. But they were dead right in WW1. America (and Europe) would have been much better off if Wilson had resisted the pressure to enter the war. So what to do? Perhaps we should be - at least initially - guided by: America goes not abroad, in search of monsters to destroy.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson The Polish Association of Memory of Victims of Crimes of Ukrainian Nationalists documented 135 methods of torture and murder practiced by Ukrainian Nazis. Poland officially called the Ukrainian actions genocide. The Ukrainians have been protected by the CIA for decades ONLY because they hated Russians. They continue to protect the Ukrainian Nazis only because they are waging war against Russia. No Ukrainian was ever prosecuted for war crimes that made the German Nazis look like amateurs. The Ukrainians were unprecedented in their war crimes during WWII, and the sheer outright cruelty has NEVER been addressed. They, above all, should have been hunted down more so than the Germans. The torture Ukrainians inflicted even on Polish and Hungarians, along with Russians and Jews, included: Running children through with stakes Cutting a person’s throat and pulling their tongue out through the hole Sawing a person’s torso in half with a carpenter’s saw Cutting open the belly of a woman in an advanced stage of pregnancy, removing the fetus, and replacing it with a live cat, before sewing up her abdomen. Cutting open a pregnant women’s abdomen and pouring in broken glass Nailing a small child to a door. There are numerous foreign soldiers who volunteered for Ukraine and then have returned shocked at the extent of the war crimes carried out by Ukrainians. You have no idea of the seething hatred of all Russian-speaking people in the Donbas or in Russia. A significant number of Ukrainians have no problem killing and torturing Russians. If you did your research, the extent of the cruelty of the Ukrainian Nazis even shocked the German Nazis. They would cut out a baby of a pregnant woman and so in a live cat. They killed countless people from Poland and the Russians as well as Jews. They do not teach what the Ukrainian Nazis did in Ukraine because it was too horrible. One report stated: “Some Ukrainian educators believe the Holocaust is not an appropriate topic for teaching because in a Holocaust course a professor would need to let Ukrainian students know that some Jews were betrayed to the Nazis by Ukrainian neighbors. In addition, the OUN and UPA took part in the annihilation of Jews in western Ukraine, and this knowledge can shock young Ukrainians. ” id/pg 205 I have videos that are too horrible to show of Ukrainians torturing Russian soldiers today, nailing them to a cross, and then setting them on fire. There are numerous foreign soldiers returning who are totally disgusted by what they have witnessed in Ukraine. One reported that they simply shot all the Russian soldiers they captured. Nobody will tell the truth because as long as they hate Russia, then Russia’s enemy is the West’s friend. The Ukrainian Neo-Nazis have been the most ruthless people I have ever encountered in history. Add to that, Ukraine is the most corrupt country in Europe even declared by the IMF. In fact, they may be the most corrupt in the world. Zelensky has called on NATO to use nuclear weapons to destroy Russia. This is the typical ethnic hatred that has always consumed Ukraine. They were the neo-Naris who joined Hitler because they were still practicing ethnic cleansing. They hate anyone other than Ukrainian and have killed hundreds of thousands of Polish, Hungarians, Russians, and even Jews. “We’re not asking for nuclear weapons to be given to us,” he claimed yet he has been raising the nuclear argument before Russia crossed the border. Last week, Zelensky implied that obtaining nuclear weapons should be provided if his country couldn’t join NATO. “Either Ukraine has nuclear weapons, which will serve as its protection, or it must be part of some kind of alliance.” There is no mistake about Zelensky. The Ukrainian people had better rise up against this modern-day Hitler who still harbors ethnic cleansing. Putin warned that this would be a very “dangerous provocation.” Zelensky is an evil, greedy person who only thinks about destroying Russia, just as the Ukrainians were doing for Hitler. Putin further added: “I can say right away that Russia will not allow this to happen under any circumstances.” Zelensky claimed his Victory Plan was not nuclear, just the total destruction of Russia. Any Western leader who gives anything to Ukraine is an absolute traitor to his people. This will end in World War III, the West WILL LOSE, and the world’s financial capital will move to Beijing. Anyone who supports Zelensky should be dragged out of office ASAP.

So what to do? Perhaps we should be - at least initially - guided by: America goes not abroad, in search of monsters to destroy.

There are numerous foreign soldiers who volunteered for Ukraine and then have returned shocked at the extent of the war crimes carried out by Ukrainians. You have no idea of the seething hatred of all Russian-speaking people in the Donbas or in Russia. A significant number of Ukrainians have no problem killing and torturing Russians. If you did your research, the extent of the cruelty of the Ukrainian Nazis even shocked the German Nazis. They would cut out a baby of a pregnant woman and so in a live cat. They killed countless people from Poland and the Russians as well as Jews. They do not teach what the Ukrainian Nazis did in Ukraine because it was too horrible. One report stated: “Some Ukrainian educators believe the Holocaust is not an appropriate topic for teaching because in a Holocaust course a professor would need to let Ukrainian students know that some Jews were betrayed to the Nazis by Ukrainian neighbors. In addition, the OUN and UPA took part in the annihilation of Jews in western Ukraine, and this knowledge can shock young Ukrainians. ” id/pg 205 I have videos that are too horrible to show of Ukrainians torturing Russian soldiers today, nailing them to a cross, and then setting them on fire. There are numerous foreign soldiers returning who are totally disgusted by what they have witnessed in Ukraine. One reported that they simply shot all the Russian soldiers they captured. Nobody will tell the truth because as long as they hate Russia, then Russia’s enemy is the West’s friend. The Ukrainian Neo-Nazis have been the most ruthless people I have ever encountered in history. Add to that, Ukraine is the most corrupt country in Europe even declared by the IMF. In fact, they may be the most corrupt in the world. Zelensky has called on NATO to use nuclear weapons to destroy Russia. This is the typical ethnic hatred that has always consumed Ukraine. They were the neo-Naris who joined Hitler because they were still practicing ethnic cleansing. They hate anyone other than Ukrainian and have killed hundreds of thousands of Polish, Hungarians, Russians, and even Jews. “We’re not asking for nuclear weapons to be given to us,” he claimed yet he has been raising the nuclear argument before Russia crossed the border. Last week, Zelensky implied that obtaining nuclear weapons should be provided if his country couldn’t join NATO. “Either Ukraine has nuclear weapons, which will serve as its protection, or it must be part of some kind of alliance.” There is no mistake about Zelensky. The Ukrainian people had better rise up against this modern-day Hitler who still harbors ethnic cleansing. Putin warned that this would be a very “dangerous provocation.” Zelensky is an evil, greedy person who only thinks about destroying Russia, just as the Ukrainians were doing for Hitler. Putin further added: “I can say right away that Russia will not allow this to happen under any circumstances.” Zelensky claimed his Victory Plan was not nuclear, just the total destruction of Russia. Any Western leader who gives anything to Ukraine is an absolute traitor to his people. This will end in World War III, the West WILL LOSE, and the world’s financial capital will move to Beijing. Anyone who supports Zelensky should be dragged out of office ASAP.

Because the “America First” crowd was dead wrong in WW2. But they were dead right in WW1. America (and Europe) would have been much better off if Wilson had resisted the pressure to enter the war. So what to do? Perhaps we should be - at least initially - guided by: America goes not abroad, in search of monsters to destroy.

In addition, the OUN and UPA took part in the annihilation of Jews in western Ukraine, and this knowledge can shock young Ukrainians. ” id/pg 205 I have videos that are too horrible to show of Ukrainians torturing Russian soldiers today, nailing them to a cross, and then setting them on fire. There are numerous foreign soldiers returning who are totally disgusted by what they have witnessed in Ukraine. One reported that they simply shot all the Russian soldiers they captured. Nobody will tell the truth because as long as they hate Russia, then Russia’s enemy is the West’s friend. The Ukrainian Neo-Nazis have been the most ruthless people I have ever encountered in history. Add to that, Ukraine is the most corrupt country in Europe even declared by the IMF. In fact, they may be the most corrupt in the world. Zelensky has called on NATO to use nuclear weapons to destroy Russia. This is the typical ethnic hatred that has always consumed Ukraine. They were the neo-Naris who joined Hitler because they were still practicing ethnic cleansing. They hate anyone other than Ukrainian and have killed hundreds of thousands of Polish, Hungarians, Russians, and even Jews. “We’re not asking for nuclear weapons to be given to us,” he claimed yet he has been raising the nuclear argument before Russia crossed the border. Last week, Zelensky implied that obtaining nuclear weapons should be provided if his country couldn’t join NATO. “Either Ukraine has nuclear weapons, which will serve as its protection, or it must be part of some kind of alliance.” There is no mistake about Zelensky. The Ukrainian people had better rise up against this modern-day Hitler who still harbors ethnic cleansing. Putin warned that this would be a very “dangerous provocation.” Zelensky is an evil, greedy person who only thinks about destroying Russia, just as the Ukrainians were doing for Hitler. Putin further added: “I can say right away that Russia will not allow this to happen under any circumstances.” Zelensky claimed his Victory Plan was not nuclear, just the total destruction of Russia. Any Western leader who gives anything to Ukraine is an absolute traitor to his people. This will end in World War III, the West WILL LOSE, and the world’s financial capital will move to Beijing.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Zelensky has called on NATO to use nuclear weapons to destroy Russia. This is the typical ethnic hatred that has always consumed Ukraine. They were the neo-Naris who joined Hitler because they were still practicing ethnic cleansing. They hate anyone other than Ukrainian and have killed hundreds of thousands of Polish, Hungarians, Russians, and even Jews. “We’re not asking for nuclear weapons to be given to us,” he claimed yet he has been raising the nuclear argument before Russia crossed the border. Last week, Zelensky implied that obtaining nuclear weapons should be provided if his country couldn’t join NATO. “Either Ukraine has nuclear weapons, which will serve as its protection, or it must be part of some kind of alliance.” There is no mistake about Zelensky. The Ukrainian people had better rise up against this modern-day Hitler who still harbors ethnic cleansing. Putin warned that this would be a very “dangerous provocation.” Zelensky is an evil, greedy person who only thinks about destroying Russia, just as the Ukrainians were doing for Hitler. Putin further added: “I can say right away that Russia will not allow this to happen under any circumstances.” Zelensky claimed his Victory Plan was not nuclear, just the total destruction of Russia. Any Western leader who gives anything to Ukraine is an absolute traitor to his people. This will end in World War III, the West WILL LOSE, and the world’s financial capital will move to Beijing. Anyone who supports Zelensky should be dragged out of office ASAP.

By Bob Unruh October 27, 2024 If picking a despicable name for your political opponent were a competition, Democrats and other leftists across America may have thought they had the winner as, for years, they have called President Donald Trump a “Hitler.” It was their attempt to find the most horrific, reprehensible descriptive for him. But they lost, according to a controversial former Roman Catholic archbishop. Get the hottest, most important news stories on the Internet – delivered FREE to your inbox as soon as they break!

That church leader, Carlo Maria Vigano, who was the Vatican’s ambassador to the U.S. from 2011 until 2016, described Kamala Harris as “an infernal monster who obeys Satan.” The election this year is, in fact, described by many as a spiritual fight, what with the likelihood Harris would push harder for the Biden-Harris administration’s top agenda items of abortion for all and transgenderism, including body mutilations, for children, both industries opposed by most Christians. That’s besides the inflation, open southern border and more that the administration has inflicted on Americans. Vigano, in an open letter to Catholics, explained there’s no question that they should vote for Trump. He said voters in just days must decide “between two radically opposed ways of conceiving the government of your Nation.” Vigano, excommunicated this year, said, “The choice is between a conservative President, who is paying with his very life for his fight against the deep state, and an infernal monster who obeys Satan. “For a Catholic, there can be no question: voting for Kamala Harris is morally inadmissible and constitutes a very grave sin. Nor is it morally possible to abstain, because in this war declaring oneself neutral means allying oneself with the enemy.” Vigano ran into trouble inside the politics of the Catholic community for his criticisms of Pope Francis, a liberal whose leftist pronouncements often have stunned the community, and the “modern” reforms in the church. The New York Post explained, “His letter contains numerous references to numerous conspiracy theories, including references to the ‘deep state,’ calling the 2020 presidential election ‘the fraud of 2020’ and suggesting that the world governments engineered climate change to ‘to make the global warming fraud credible.'” He also condemned America’s “woke” ideologies, abortion and transgenderism, and the “dens of indoctrination and corruption from kindergarten onwards” that American schools have become. He explained voting is a moral duty, but the 2024 vote choice is more than that, as it is “between two radically opposed ways of conceiving the government of your Nation: you are called to choose between democracy and dictatorship, between freedom and slavery.” He said, “On one side we have candidate Donald J. Trump, who, despite serious problems in his positions – especially in the matter of abortion and assisted procreation – has as his objective the common good and the protection of the fundamental freedoms of citizens. In Donald Trump’s America, every Catholic can practice their Faith and educate their children in it without interference from the State. On the other side we have a candidate and a party that promotes everything that directly opposes the Faith and Morals of the Catholic Church. In Kamala Harris’ America, Catholics – but also Protestants – are considered fundamentalists to be marginalized and eliminated, and their children are considered the property of the State, which arrogates to itself the right to lead them astray from an early age in both body and soul. “Trump’s America can become great and prosperous again. Harris’ America is destined for invasion and for moral, social, and economic destruction: the most ferocious dictatorship,” he warned. Democrat-run cities, for example, now are “dumps filled with derelicts and criminals, drug dealers and addicts, prostitutes and robbers. Your schools are dens of indoctrination and corruption from kindergarten onwards. In your courts, criminals are acquitted and innocents are imprisoned: new ideological crimes are prosecuted, while illegality is tolerated and encouraged. In your hospitals, multinational corporations rule, and you are their guinea pigs to be exterminated or made chronically ill so that you will be their perpetual clients,” he wrote. He described the green ideology, promoted by Biden and Harris, “lies without any scientific proof.” America now, he said, has “a puppet in the White House and a corrupt and incompetent Vice President who has never stopped lying and deceiving voters about her past and her future. Power is managed by the criminal deep state – whose names and faces we now know – that is responsible for the destruction of your great Nation.”: Under Harris, he said, American would be destined to be “manipulated by Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.” “Do not think that these are remote hypotheses: wherever the woke Left takes power, it establishes the most vicious, anti-human, and anti-Christian dictatorship that humanity has ever known. And we know that every time the Left has come to power, it has never left through democratic means,” he warned. Singled out for condemnation are Obama, Clinton, George Soros, Klaus Schwab, Jeffrey Epstein, Sean Combs, the World Economic Forum, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Vanguard, BlackRock and StateStreet. “Behind these people – by now we should know this – are people devoted to evil, united by the satanic hatred against Our Lord Jesus Christ and those who believe in Him, mainly against the Catholic faithful. We want Christ to reign, and we proclaim it with pride: Christ is King! They want the Antichrist to reign, whose tyranny is made of chaos, war, disease, famine, and death.” He pointed out while Trump holds some positions with which Catholics do not agree, he represents the “only possible choice to counter the globalist coup that the woke Left is about to implement definitively, irreparably, and with incalculable damage for future generations.” Bob Unruh joined WND in 2006 after nearly three decades with the Associated Press, as well as several Upper Midwest newspapers, where he covered everything from legislative battles and sports to tornadoes and homicidal survivalists.

Posted on 10/27/2024 9:13:59 AM PDT by delta7 Zelensky Tells Trump That Ukraine Faces a Fork in the Road: Join NATO or Go Nuclear What way out do we have?' the wartime leader tells the 45th president. 'Either Ukraine will have nuclear weapons, which for us will be a defense, or we'll need to have some sort of alliance.' COMMENT: Mr. Armstrong, I have family in Kyiv, and as you have reported, they are unhappy with Volodymyr Zelenskyy. I am not sure who is pulling his strings, but he is a threat to Ukraine. As you have pointed out, they had their freedom. Attacking the Donbas was not for the people’s benefit. It seems that anyone who tells the truth is attacked as putting out Russian propaganda. He has shut down all the press that even questioned what was going on in Ukraine. I wish more people would open their eyes. Thank you for trying. ANSWER: It is not Russian propaganda but Neocon propaganda that we need to be worried about, just like the weapons of mass destruction of Saddam that never existed or the Russians that were never behind Vietnam. When the war just began, I reported that 100,000 Ukrainians had been killed in the first few months. The emails came in accusing me of putting out Russian propaganda. It did not matter that my sources were from Ukraine. Then, the head of the EU gave the same number. Zelensky made her take that out, claiming it was classified information. Here is the original clip and the edited one. This was NOT Russian propaganda. Even Ukrainian TV has reported that over 1 million Ukrainians have been killed in this war, and for what? So Blackrock can buy up all the farmland? Zelensky is asking for nuclear weapons. He knows that Russia would then have no choice but to annihilate Ukraine. Putin would be justified in responding just as President Kennedy responded in 1962 because of nuclear weapons being stationed in Cuba. The Ukrainian People Deserve to Decide their own Fate, not one dictated by the Neocons in the USA or NATO. Zelensky has been asking to JOIN NATO, which is instant World War III or give him nuclear weapons. This is just unimaginable! Ukraine should have been split according to ethnicity, the same as the fall of Yugoslavia. Just as a Serb killed the archduke and heir to Austria in Seriavo and started World War I, the ethnic hatred in this region can only be suppressed by division.

Politicans instalked in a coup who in turn sold everything of value not nailed down to western benafactors... then the money was spent to build an army twice the size of Russia’s. As the AFU grew Ukraine leveraged most national assets against loans. The strategy employed by NATO in Ukraine ensures you fight snd die in place. This strategy was designed to “the last Ukrainian” make it impossible for Ukraine to assert its birthright and remain bought or defaulted to western ownership. Russia is actually Ukraine’s only hope of ever discharging the debt owed to the west, which if totally defeated in a war those loans are moot. Zelinski and a puppet government living in exile in the west are not going to pay the loans with any of the stolen funds they took. Ukraine got robbed by the west over and again. A coup that essentially transferred ownership of Ukraine’s birthright is a creative rape of a people separating them from a soverign nation. Never trust a democrat. Never trust America as an ally... which is why Brics took off on steroids to flee USD Oppression, and a repeat of the scheme to rape Ukraine. Russia is destroying the AFU. The pace of advancement in Ukraine by Russia, and daily reduction of 3k soldiers daily, mean that Kiev could be within artillery range by 1 January 2025. Today Rusdia has more soldiers, drones, vehicles, tanks, artillery, etc., than Ukraine and even in June 2024 Ukraine had more troops and drones. Putin will have to destroy AZOV and disarm Ukraine. NATO screaming about foreign soldiers helping Russia is more about who is occupying Ukraine and its pasification which will not affect Rusdian soldiers as Putins allies finish off lone wolves, and enforce the peacekeeping. Ukraine deserves Biden and Zelinski. 14 posted on 10/27/2024 1:34:15 PM PDT by Jumper [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] Disclaimer: Opinions posted on Free Republic are those of the individual posters and do not necessarily represent the opinion of Free Republic or its management.

When the war just began, I reported that 100,000 Ukrainians had been killed in the first few months. The emails came in accusing me of putting out Russian propaganda. It did not matter that my sources were from Ukraine. Then, the head of the EU gave the same number. Zelensky made her take that out, claiming it was classified information. Here is the original clip and the edited one. This was NOT Russian propaganda. Even Ukrainian TV has reported that over 1 million Ukrainians have been killed in this war, and for what? So Blackrock can buy up all the farmland? Zelensky is asking for nuclear weapons. He knows that Russia would then have no choice but to annihilate Ukraine. Putin would be justified in responding just as President Kennedy responded in 1962 because of nuclear weapons being stationed in Cuba. The Ukrainian People Deserve to Decide their own Fate, not one dictated by the Neocons in the USA or NATO. Zelensky has been asking to JOIN NATO, which is instant World War III or give him nuclear weapons. This is just unimaginable! Ukraine should have been split according to ethnicity, the same as the fall of Yugoslavia. Just as a Serb killed the archduke and heir to Austria in Seriavo and started World War I, the ethnic hatred in this region can only be suppressed by division.

Title: Disney is on Project 2025’s List of Companies That Need to Change the Way They Do Business

in Hong Kong Disneyland, Shanghai Disneyland, Theme Parks, Updates Credit: Disney Project 2025 has finally entered the mainstream media over the past few weeks. It is a conversation agenda, and should Donald Trump retake the White House in 2025, Related: Supreme Court Sides With DeSantis in Punishing Disney World Cast Members However, this document also takes issue with The Walt Disney Company and its business practices. Should there be a second President Trump term, this could impact how Disney conducts its business in the future. So, what is Project 2025, and what does it say about The Walt Disney Company? Essentially, Project 2025 is a wish list for a conservative government takeover if Donald Trump wins the White House in November. It is an outline of legislative priorities that can be accomplished without Congress, which would ultimately give the President more power. The Heritage Foundation created the document with input from over 100 conservative organizations and former President Trump appointees. Conservatives are referring to it as a second American Revolution. Related: With the Supreme Court and DeSantis Against Them, Disney World Cast Member Get Help From the Federal Government Among its proposals for the federal government would be to eliminate job protections for federal workers, allow the President to make changes in widespread areas of the government, and place most of the federal government directly under the President’s control. It calls for slashing government investment in climate and renewable energy research and increased domestic oil production. It does not call for a nationwide ban on abortion and contraceptives but does say that pills used in abortions should be banned. It also calls for broader government control over technology, including the banning of all pornography on the internet. Project 2025 also wants parental controls over schools and a wider use of school voucher programs. Related: Disney Under Fire for Videos Claiming They Don’t Hire ‘White Men,’ But How Real is the Threat? There are two mentions of The Walt Disney Company in the document and the company’s business dealings with China. The document says: In some cases, these voices, like global corporate giants BlackRock and Disney—or the National Basketball Association (NBA)—directly benefit from doing business with Beijing. Part of the Project 2025 agenda is to dramatically increase tariffs on the Chinese, which would hurt American business in China. If re-elected, Donald Trump has also said he would ban Chineses citizens from owning a range of assets in America, but he would also ban American companies from investing in China. This would complicate Disney’s investment in Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland and put future investment in those theme parks in jeopardy. The second mention of Disney comes in a section on the COVID-19 Pandemic. This section accuses some global voices of silencing accusations that China released the COVID-19 virus from a lab. The report reads: In some cases, these voices, like the global corporate giants BlackRock and Disney, directly benefit from doing business with Beijing. If enacted, Project 2025 could have a dramatic effect on how The Walt Disney Company does business in China, but also here in the United States. You can read the entiretity of Project 2025 here.

Title: Wall Street and tech royalty fly to Saudi event amid Mideast war

Time Published: 2024-10-27T15:03:17Z
Full Content:
Saudi Arabia will host the biggest names in finance and technology this coming week in a test of investor appetite for the kingdom’s ambitions of transforming itself into a global hub at a time of widening regional conflict. International executives will have to contend with a region rocked by geopolitical tensions, with the threat of further military confrontation between Israel and Iran at the highest levels in decades. And they will land in a country that is increasingly facing up to the fact that even its vast oil wealth has limits. But those arriving at the Future Investment Initiative – often dubbed Davos in the desert – seem undeterred, sensing an opportunity to plug into Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s trillion-dollar Vision 2030 economic remake. Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s David Solomon, Citigroup Inc.’s Jane Fraser and BlackRock Inc.’s Larry Fink have become regulars at the Riyadh summit and are set to return this year. Reflecting Saudi Arabia’s focus on technology and artificial intelligence, they’ll be joined by prominent names in those industries. Alphabet Inc. President Ruth Porat and TikTok Inc. Chief Executive Officer Shou Chew are set to speak at the summit for the first time. Benjamin Horowitz, tech entrepreneur and co-founder of venture capital giant Andreessen Horowitz, is also making an appearance. Read More: Saudi Arabia, UAE Bet on Chips to Power Post-Oil Future Wall Street and Silicon Valley have increasingly turned to the oil-rich Middle East as liquidity gets tighter in other parts of the world, especially China. Saudi Arabia itself commands nearly $1 trillion in sovereign wealth, though the Crown Prince wants titans of industry to stop deploying that money overseas and instead help support his domestic ambitions. Yet the backdrop is one of increasing uncertainty. Saudi foreign policy has recently focused on lowering regional tensions in the hope that a more stable region will bring in foreign capital and technological know-how. But events of the past year have served as a reminder of how unstable the region can be. “The impact of regional instability on the prospects for foreign investment is completely negative, with the possible exception of the defense industry,” said Gregory Gause, Professor of International Affairs at Texas A&M University. Capital is “not attracted to conflict regions, even if the country is not an immediate participant in the conflict.” To be sure, Saudi Arabia is still pushing ahead with its big development plans. Deals worth more than $28 billion are likely to be announced over the next week by executives from around the world, according to Richard Attias, CEO of the FII Institute. Some of these will focus on AI, including potentially a new fund with Andreessen Horowitz that could grow to as large as $40 billion. The kingdom is also expected to announce a new company that will invest at least $10 billion in making Saudi Arabia a top global producer of hydrogen — a low carbon fuel that could be key to the world’s transition away from burning fossil fuels. Two exchange-traded funds will make their trading debuts in Riyadh, giving Saudi investors access to Hong Kong stocks — a reflection of the kingdom’s growing ties with China as it looks to boost investment flows with its biggest trading partner. Hong Kong Financial Secretary Paul Chan, and the Commissioner for the Belt and Road, Nicholas Ho, will speak at FII as some of the highest profile speakers from Asia. Still, the regional conflict is undoubtedly weighing on global investor sentiment in the Middle East. Saudi Arabia, the biggest Gulf economy, is feeling some of that. The number of actively-managed emerging market funds with Saudi exposure had been rising sharply until earlier this year, but stalled at around 56% as tensions between Israel and Iran escalated, according to Copley Fund Research. The data show that the number of funds invested in the Saudi stock market fell slightly between March and September this year and that the country is the third-biggest underweight after Taiwan and India. Coupled with that, Crown Prince Mohammed has had to come to terms with the limits of even Saudi Arabia’s vast financial resources to pay for his ambitions. The government, which is forecasting deficits out to at least 2027, has said some projects will be need to be delayed. Read More: Saudi Prince’s Trillion-Dollar Makeover Faces Funding Cutbacks At the same time, the Public Investment Fund, the kingdom’s powerful sovereign fund that the de-facto ruler chairs, is becoming a tougher place for foreign firms to get money out of. An increased focus on domestic projects like the $1.5 trillion Neom has global asset managers fretting that the PIF will have less cash to spend abroad. “The FII has always been designed as a mechanism for investment into Saudi, however in reality it has been an opportunity for foreign execs to extract financing from the Kingdom,” said Zaid Belbagi, managing partner of political risk consultancy Hardcastle Advisory. “Sold-out hotels at $500-1000 per night are indicative of sustained international interest.” The organizers of the Riyadh jamboree remain confident, and about 7,000 people have registered to attend this year’s event. That’s higher than the numbers for last year’s summit, which took place days after the current conflict in the region started. Investors are coming “despite what is happening in the world,” FII Institute’s Attias said. “The show must go on.” © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Title: A Bitcoin supply shock is brewing – Will BTC hit $70K next?
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/a-bitcoin-supply-shock-is-brewing-will-btc-hit-70k-next/
Time Published: 2024-10-27T15:00:19Z
Full Content:
With BTC at a tipping point, the market may soon witness a decisive movement as conditions for a supply shock develop. Bitcoin [BTC] has been consolidating within the $66K-$67K range for the past seven days, currently trading at $67,160 with a slight 0.57% gain from the previous day. This consolidation mirrors BTC’s July pattern, where resistance at $68K led to a swift drop below $55K. Thus, staying within this range is critical to avoid a similar downturn. Interestingly, October’s gains have largely been driven by a post-halving supply squeeze, bringing fresh scarcity to the market. Now, as BTC wraps up its most bullish month, conditions may be ripe for a supply shock if demand aligns. Historically, the post-halving period has acted as a significant catalyst for bullish rallies, particularly from an economic standpoint. As BTC supply tightens, miners are often the most impacted, leading to their widespread capitulation. In simple terms, as block rewards decrease, miners may find it challenging to cover their operational costs, prompting many to exit the market. This shakeout leaves only the most efficient miners in the ecosystem, potentially creating a more robust environment for price appreciation as supply diminishes. Source : X As evidenced by the chart above, miner reserves have been steadily declining since the April halving, reflecting these dynamics. While one might assume this would create selling pressure, the scarcity of BTC among miners – especially as block rewards hit lower lows – has not significantly impacted the market. If demand remains high, much of the selling pressure is absorbed, creating ideal conditions for a supply crunch. This environment kept October bullish, with BTC nearly testing $70K. However, a breakout has yet to materialize, indicating that the anticipated supply shock has not occurred. This scenario maintains optimism for a potential parabolic rally as we approach the end of Q4. The effects of the halving are evident: Bitcoin’s mining difficulty has reached an all-time high, meaning it now requires more computational power to process transactions. This situation is forcing out less efficient miners. Source : Bitcoin Magazine Pro As a result, the hash rate has also increased, indicating a more secure and robust network. This trend highlights the consolidation of mining operations, where only those with the best technology and lowest costs can survive. In short, a mass capitulation could still be on the horizon, potentially leading to a significant price increase as available supply dwindles against persistent demand. Currently, all exchanges are seeing a significant increase in BTC reserves, indicating selling pressure primarily from the mining community for the reasons mentioned above. As noted earlier, a supply shock could materialize if demand remains high despite this pressure; otherwise, a repeat of the July cycle might occur. Interestingly, October has seen a notable uptick in ETF inflows, suggesting growing retail interest. Source : BGeometrics Furthermore, BlackRock’s Bitcoin holdings have exceeded 400K BTC, reaching 403,725 BTC, worth $26.98 billion. Over the past two weeks alone, BlackRock has purchased 34,085 BTC, valued at $2.3 billion. This indicates that institutional demand is surging, reinforcing AMBCrypto’s initial hypothesis of a brewing supply shock. Read Bitcoin’s [BTC] Price Prediction 2024–2025 While the current consolidation is crucial for preventing BTC from faltering, a consistent balance between demand and supply will ultimately determine whether BTC can reach a new ATH before the end of this quarter. Regardless, the miner capitulation highlights the effects of the post-halving environment; their exit now requires a more sustained buying effort at current prices. While a slight retracement may occur, a full-fledged pullback seems unlikely.

Title: The Green New Scam Is Dying
URL: https://activistpost.com/2024/10/the-green-new-scam-is-dying.html
Time Published: 2024-10-27T14:08:08Z
Full Content:
October 27, 2024 Authored by James Rickards via DailyReckoning.com It’s no secret that the vast majority of the so-called elites are advocates of climate alarmism and are taken in by the Green New Scam. Whether this preference is based on ignorance of the science, ideological zeal, a willful desire to hurt American growth or simple greed because of their investments in Green New Scam infrastructure varies case by case. The typical upper-income supporter of the climate cult including academics, media figures and celebrities is probably ignorant of the fact that there is no evidence that CO2 emissions cause climate change and that the real causes are solar cycles, volcanoes, ocean currents and atmospheric moisture not caused by humans. The historical record actually demonstrates that warming periods produce higher CO2 levels — not the other way around. CO2 doesn’t cause warming. It’s caused by natural warming. In other words, climate alarmists have causation completely backward. Climate alarmism is based almost entirely on computer models, which depend on the inputs the modelers themselves build into them. A model is only as good as the inputs and assumptions programmed into it. Virtually every one of these models has overestimated warming, sometimes by orders of magnitude, because it’s based on faulty assumptions that overestimate the impact of CO2 on climate. In other words, it’s junk science. But they keep relying on these models because their political agenda requires it. There’s no doubt that a fair number of neo-Marxists embrace the climate scam because they know it damages U.S. industry, raises costs to U.S. consumers and helps to undermine the U.S. economy. Following the end of the Cold War and the collapse of communism, anti-capitalistic collectivists admitted that they needed to promote the climate agenda because the only way to combat global warming is through collective action. It requires a coordinated global effort that limits national sovereignty. The neo-Marxists are impervious to evidence; they just want to hurt America and wasting money on windmills instead of building new refineries is a good way to do it. That leaves the greed crowd. They’re early investors in windmills, solar modules, lithium car batteries, EVs, charging stations, carbon credits and other infrastructure of the climate scam. They stand to make billions of dollars off the narrative with help from extravagant government subsidies. They don’t really care if it all collapses in the end (which it will) as long as they get rich at taxpayer expense in the meantime. All of this behavior is clear as far as it goes. What is not clear is the extent to which the Green New Scammers are doing this with your money. The best example is multibillionaire Larry Fink, who runs the giant BlackRock investment fund. Fink has been aggressive in promoting the climate scam along with racial quotas, DEI and defunding police. He’s entitled to his opinions. But is he entitled to pursue his radical agenda with pension fund money from conservative states and institutions? Fortunately, a backlash has begun against Fink and his fellow wokesters. More state pension fund managers are beginning to pull their funds from BlackRock and other investment managers that pursue far-left policies not in the best interests of their beneficiaries. This backlash may not change Larry Fink’s lifestyle. But over time, it might change the world for the better. A major part of the climate agenda includes electric vehicles (EVs). I’ve been warning for years that EVs aren’t feasible as a transportation solution for more than relatively few Americans and that they are little more than glorified golf carts despite the $70,000-and-up price tags. In the first place, EVs don’t cut carbon emissions. The car itself does not have emissions, but it’s charged with electricity from power plants that do. The batteries are made with poisonous chemicals and metals including lithium, cobalt, copper and nickel that come from mining operations that use enormous amounts of water and electricity to extract the needed materials. It takes thousands of tons of ore to extract enough critical minerals to make one battery. EVs don’t take a charge in extreme cold, and the batteries can’t hold a charge. Travel range is grossly overstated for many reasons, including the fact that EV car heaters drain the batteries (with internal-combustion engines, ICEs, the engine makes heat which can easily be directed into the car to keep passengers comfortable with no additional energy required). Resale values of EVs are close to zero because buyers of used EVs have to shell out $25,000 or more for new batteries after the vehicle is about seven years old. The list of drawbacks goes on. Most Americans have resisted EVs because they understand the disadvantages. But many Americans were drawn to the false promise of emission-free transportation and other ridiculous claims by the Green New Scammers. Now even the most committed EV buyers are waking up. A fairly recent survey by consulting firm McKinsey and Co. shows that 29% of EV owners in nine major economies want to return to ICE vehicles. When the sample is narrowed to just the U.S., 46% of those surveyed want to return to ICEs. The McKinsey officials who conducted the survey claimed to be “surprised” by those results. That probably says something about the fact that McKinsey experts were just as deluded about EVs as the buyers surveyed. When breaking down the results, 45% say EVs are too expensive, 33% say they have charging concerns and 29% are concerned about the limited driving range. The truth is that the EV was invented in 1837 and reached the peak of its popularity in 1910 just before the mass production of internal-combustion cars by Henry Ford. The American public got it right when they flocked to the Model T. It sounds like they’re getting it right again after a brief infatuation with the false promise of the EV. The bottom line is that the Green New Scam is falling apart. It can’t happen soon enough. Sourced from ZeroHedge Become a Patron!

Title: Super Micro Computer, Inc. (SMCI): An Unstoppable Stock That Could Make You Richer

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 8 Unstoppable Stocks That Could Make You Richer. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) stands against the other unstoppable stocks. In the current climate of extreme market volatility, finding safe and stable investments is challenging. Valuations seem overstretched following one of the longest bull runs, with major indices reaching record highs. Despite this, the focus should remain on stocks of companies with strong fundamentals and solid long-term prospects. Similarly, it's crucial to consider companies that can withstand uncertainties caused by various headwinds, such as rising geopolitical tensions, the US election, and the high interest rate environment. While the recent Federal Reserve rate cut, declining inflation rates, and a prolonged bull market have benefited investors, not all stocks are responding uniformly. READ ALSO: 8 Worst Performing Tech Stocks in 2024 and 10 Worst Performing Blue Chip Stocks in 2024. As the US election approaches, economic issues remain the primary concern for most voters. Despite the equity market's upward trend, the US economy has experienced several shocks, including slowdowns in the labor and real estate markets. Although inflation has decreased from a high of 9.2% to 2.4%, the Federal Reserve had to cut interest rates by 50 basis points to prevent a recession. "Even as the data shows inflation has theoretically been slowing down, it has become more important in people's minds over the course of the last three quarters, not less important," said Jay Campbell, partner at Hart Research, the Democratic pollster for the survey. The significant drop in inflation has coincided with higher growth expectations, driving upward momentum in the equity markets. Strong macroeconomic data, such as impressive GDP and retail sales figures, have supported these growth expectations. Amid these expectations, bond yields have increased, indicating that investors are selling safe-haven assets. Economists at Goldman Sachs suggest that the rise in yields is due to promising growth prospects rather than factors like the anticipation of Donald Trump's potential presidency or concerns about the Fed's rate cuts causing inflation to spike again. "Yields have risen significantly over the past several weeks, which we find has owed primarily to continued strong U.S. growth momentum rather than shifts in election odds," Goldman said in a recent note. Conversely, escalating trade and tariff tensions between the US and China pose a threat to market sentiment. The International Monetary Fund has warned that these tensions could have costly economic consequences globally. "We are seeing geopolitically driven trade around the world, which is why when you look at overall trade to GDP that's holding up fine, but who's trading with whom is certainly changing," said Gita Gopinath, deputy managing director of the International Monetary Fund, to CNBC on October 23, 2024. In response to perceived unfair trade practices by Beijing, the US and EU have increased tariffs on certain Chinese goods, further escalating trade tensions this year. Despite rising geopolitical tensions, long-term investing remains the best strategy for building a profitable portfolio and sustaining growth over time. Key factors to consider include investing in businesses rather than just share prices, understanding the underlying business, and consistently investing during both market highs and lows. Our Methodology For this article, we identified approximately 20 stocks with a year-to-date share price gain of over 30% as of October 25 and an average analyst price target upside of at least 30%. We then narrowed the list to the 8 stocks with the highest average analyst price target upsides, ranking them primarily by upside potential and secondarily by year-to-date gains. At Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A team of technicians in a server room, testing and managing the newest server solutions. Average Analysts Upside Potential as of October 25: 33.40% Year-to-date gains: 66.89% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 47 Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) is an unstoppable stock that could make you richer as it is developing high-performance server and storage solutions that are in high demand amid the artificial intelligence race and digital revolution. It is turning out to be one of the biggest beneficiaries of the AI boom as it makes computers that companies use as servers for data storage. At the start of 2024, Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) held just 6% of the worldwide server market. Selling liquid-cooled, high-performance servers for demanding computing tasks has allowed it to carve out a niche for itself. Because of this, Nvidia found Supermicro to be a perfect partner and provided it with top-tier data center GPUs to aid in producing dedicated AI servers. Though not exclusive, its strategic partnership with Nvidia has strengthened its competitive edge in the server market. Super Micro's revenue more than quadrupled from $3.6 billion in fiscal 2021 to $14.9 billion in fiscal 2024, coinciding with the generative AI market's explosive growth. Additionally, its earnings per share (EPS) increased by almost ten times. More than half of its revenue now comes from AI servers. The confirmation that Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) is shipping more than 100,000 graphics processing units used for artificial intelligence underlines the strong demand that could translate into billions of dollars in revenues. Like other cloud service providers, Super Micro claimed to have recently installed over 100,000 GPUs with liquid cooling for some of the largest AI factories ever built. The soaring GPU orders are one of the reasons analysts remain bullish about Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI), with an average price target of $64.22, implying a 33.40% upside potential as of October 25, 2024. As per Insider Monkey's Q2 2024 database, the company was in the portfolios of 47 hedge funds. Scout Investments, Inc, an affiliate of Carillon Tower Advisers, released a second-quarter 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said: "Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) was the top detractor to returns in the second quarter. Super Micro designs and manufactures server solutions based on modular and open-standard architecture. This modular approach combined with a strong engineering culture helps the company to supply the market with advanced servers and rack-scale compute solutions quickly. After an impressive return in the first quarter, the company offered disappointing near-term earnings guidance, though we do not believe its long-term opportunity has diminished. We expect continued strong growth for several years, although the range of outcomes is quite wide; it is difficult to forecast AI server market growth with precision." Overall SMCI ranks 8th on our list of the unstoppable stocks that could make you richer. While we acknowledge the potential of SMCI as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than SMCI but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Larry fink on Bitcoin

ERIC KIM $10T in Blackrock … . Larry Fink, BlackRock’s CEO, has significantly shifted his stance on Bitcoin over recent years. Initially a skeptic, Fink once doubted the value and viability of cryptocurrency. However, he now sees Bitcoin as a “legitimate financial instrument” and has even labeled it “digital gold,” emphasizing its potential as an uncorrelated asset for hedging against economic instability and currency devaluation. Fink believes Bitcoin’s appeal stems from its liquidity, transparency, and resilience in the face of global financial challenges, making it suitable for investors concerned about economic turbulence or currency devaluation. His support for Bitcoin grew further after BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF launch, which has garnered billions in investor inflows, marking a historic rise and increased legitimacy for the asset. Fink noted that the ETF’s success exemplifies the growing institutional acceptance of Bitcoin, suggesting that factors like liquidity and transparency will be more critical than regulatory constraints in driving its adoption. This strategic move reflects Fink’s and BlackRock’s broader vision to integrate digital assets into mainstream finance . . Here are some notable quotes from Larry Fink on Bitcoin: 1. “I was a skeptic, a proud skeptic… It is a legitimate financial instrument that allows you to maybe have uncorrelated type of returns.” — Reflecting his changed perspective, Fink described Bitcoin as a valid asset for hedging, especially valuable amid economic or currency instability . 2. “We believe Bitcoin is an asset class in itself.” — In a 2024 earnings call, Fink emphasized Bitcoin’s emergence as a standalone asset class with growing acceptance and liquidity, suggesting its potential to rival traditional commodities like gold . 3. “I truly don’t believe it’s a function of regulation… It’s a function of liquidity, transparency.” — Fink argued that Bitcoin’s adoption will depend more on market dynamics than on regulatory changes, likening its growth to the early mortgage and high-yield markets . 4. “Bitcoin is digital gold.” — Embracing Bitcoin’s role as a store of value, Fink compared it to gold, underscoring its legitimacy and attractiveness for investors seeking alternatives to traditional financial assets . 5. “We will continue to pioneer new products to be making investing easier and more affordable.” — Fink outlined BlackRock’s mission to innovate in investment products, including digital assets, aiming to broaden access to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies . These quotes highlight Fink’s evolution from skepticism to advocacy, positioning BlackRock at the forefront of institutional investment in digital assets.

ERIC KIM Here are some quotes on BlackRock’s investment in MicroStrategy and cryptocurrency: 1. “BlackRock Inc. has filed an SC 13G/A form… disclosing ownership of 1,023,418 shares of MicroStrategy… representing 7.5 percent ownership.” This reflects a growth in their stake over time, with the latest increase noted in early 2024 . 2. “BlackRock owns a 5.53 percent stake in Michael Saylor-led MicroStrategy, which owns the largest amount of BTC of any company. BlackRock is MicroStrategy’s largest shareholder,” marking a significant position in Bitcoin indirectly . 3. “BlackRock… with over $9.5 trillion under management, is regarded as a leader in the future of investing,” and is increasingly making moves toward cryptocurrency and blockchain . These quotes showcase BlackRock’s evolving investment strategy and growing exposure to digital assets, aligning with institutional trends. …. BlackRock’s investment in MicroStrategy has evolved significantly over the years, especially as MicroStrategy increased its focus on Bitcoin. Starting with modest holdings in the early 2010s, BlackRock gradually raised its stake as the company’s profile grew, reaching 1.4 million shares in 2019, a stake valued at approximately $200 million. However, as MicroStrategy shifted heavily into Bitcoin, BlackRock strategically increased its stake, making substantial gains as Bitcoin’s price surged. By early 2023, BlackRock held about 757,000 shares, representing an 8.1% stake. This position grew further in early 2024 when BlackRock disclosed ownership of over 1 million shares, representing 7.5% of MicroStrategy. This growth illustrates BlackRock’s interest in cryptocurrency-related investments through indirect exposure to Bitcoin, aligning with the company’s broader interest in digital assets, including its push to launch a Bitcoin ETF (exchange-traded fund) in the U.S. BlackRock’s increasing investment in MicroStrategy reflects a broader institutional shift toward digital assets, with the company strategically positioning itself as a significant investor in both blockchain technology and the digital asset ecosystem more broadly. This aligns with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink’s recent statements on the potential of digital currencies to transform financial systems and transactions globally. Sources: • Fintel (fintel.io) • Market Realist … BlackRock has been increasing its stake in MicroStrategy, which has significant holdings in Bitcoin, providing BlackRock with indirect exposure to Bitcoin. As of early 2024, BlackRock reported owning over 1 million shares of MicroStrategy, representing a 7.5% ownership stake, up from 757,000 shares in 2023. This strategic investment aligns with BlackRock’s gradual embrace of digital assets through indirect holdings and its own initiatives, such as a Bitcoin spot ETF. BlackRock’s involvement in MicroStrategy reflects a broader institutional trend toward Bitcoin and digital assets as alternative investments .

ERIC KIM December 9-10, 2024;;; Microsoft will buy Bitcoin??? . Microsoft’s upcoming shareholder meeting on December 9-10, 2024, will include a proposal for the company to consider investing in Bitcoin. This proposal, backed by the National Center for Public Policy Research, advocates for exploring Bitcoin as a treasury asset to hedge against inflation and currency devaluation. Proponents argue that Bitcoin, with its fixed supply, offers potential for value preservation in uncertain economic times. Microsoft’s board, however, opposes the proposal, advising shareholders to vote against it. They argue that the company’s current investment strategies prioritize stability and risk management, and point out that cryptocurrency’s volatility could undermine these objectives. Microsoft’s board asserts that their existing processes for evaluating various assets already include considerations of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, making the proposed assessment redundant. This vote highlights broader debates about cryptocurrency’s role in corporate finance, with influential shareholders like BlackRock having shown interest in Bitcoin investments. The vote’s outcome could signal corporate sentiment on Bitcoin adoption among large technology firms, particularly if the proposal gains notable shareholder support despite the board’s opposition. If adopted, the decision could mark a significant shift, potentially encouraging other companies to re-evaluate cryptocurrency investment strategies in the corporate sector. However, if rejected, it would reinforce the conservative stance many corporations maintain regarding crypto assets due to their inherent risks and market volatility.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 9 Best Dow Stocks to Buy According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Boeing Co (NYSE:BA) stands against the other Dow stocks. Since its introduction in 1896, the Dow Jones has undergone significant changes but remains a popular benchmark for measuring the economy and the overall stock market outlook. While the Index has gained 13% year to date, it has lagged the S&P 500, up by 21% over the same period. The significant underperformance is because the Dow is mostly made up of blue-chip American companies, most of which have come under pressure amid deteriorating macroeconomics. While the Index is mostly made up of financial services companies at 23%, followed by technology at 20%, it has felt the full brunt of deteriorating economic conditions. READ ALSO: 8 Worst Performing Tech Stocks in 2024 and 10 Worst Performing Blue Chip Stocks in 2024. The U.S. economy is reeling from the effects of high interest rates, resulting in a slowdown in the labour market, and the manufacturing sector has significantly affected the Dow holdings. Additionally, the soaring geopolitical tensions in the Middle East have rattled investors' sentiments, resulting in most of them shunning equities in favor of safe havens like bonds and treasuries. The uncertainty around the upcoming U.S. presidential election has only exacerbated the situation, with investors shunning stocks that would be affected mainly by a change of policies once there is a leadership change at the White House. According to analysts at Bank of America, who ends up in the White House and Congress could have a significant impact on critical corners of the stock market. “Profits accelerating are far more important than who is sitting in the Oval Office. But politics can make or break sub-sectors,” the firm wrote in a research note to investors. Amid the headwinds, the overall equity market has been trading higher, with major indices led by the Dow and the S&P 500 rallying to record highs. The strong gains have come on most companies delivering solid financial results and shrugging off the effects of high interest rates. Nevertheless the rallies have resulted in overstretched valuations, raising serious concerns for the investment community. “The market had moved into overbought territory, making it vulnerable to anything it perceives as negative … It’s now worried that the Fed has not declared victory on inflation, and not to mention, the concerns post-election,” said LPL Financial chief global strategist Quincy Krosby. A resilient U.S. economy that has steered clear of recession has helped support most stocks in the Dow, helping fuel the upward momentum. The International Monetary Fund thinks growth in the U.S. will remain robust. In its latest World Economic Outlook, the IMF increased its estimate for U.S. GDP in 2024 to 2.8% from its 2.6% forecast in July while raising its 2025 growth forecast for the country. It’s the only advanced economy with its economic trajectory revised upwards for both years by the IMF. Nevertheless, it has warned of slowdowns in emerging markets. “Projected slowdowns in the largest emerging market and developing economies imply a longer path to close the income gaps between poor and rich countries. Having growth stuck in low gear could also further exacerbate income inequality within economies,” the IMF warned. With the U.S. economy expected to remain resilient as the Federal Reserve pushes forth with interest rate cuts, Dow stocks that have underperformed are well poised to bounce back. A lower interest rate environment on the back of improved economic conditions heading into year-end would make the case for the best Dow stocks to buy, according to analysts. Our Methodology To compile our list of the best Dow stocks to buy according to analysts, we started by analyzing the Dow Jones Industrial Average. We screened these stocks based on average price targets, focusing on stocks with significant upside potential. Finally, we ranked these companies in ascending order based on their price target upside as of October 23. We have also mentioned the hedge fund sentiment around each stock. At Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A commercial jetliner parked at an airport, reflecting the companies success in aviation. Average Upside Potential as of October 23: 23.74% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 42 Down by about 50% over the past five years, Boeing Co (NYSE:BA) has lagged the Dow Jones index and the overall market. While the company boasts of a Competitive edge and virtual duopoly in the aerospace industry, a string of quality control and legal challenges have dragged the brand's reputation down the drain. The aerospace giant has struggled with manufacturing problems, management turmoil, and horrible financial results. A string of safety issues touching on aeroplanes has caused Boeing Co (NYSE:BA) to get hit with billions of fines and fees, rattling its sentiments in the market. While employee strikes in recent weeks have exacerbated the situation, the company’s long-term prospects remain intact, affirming why it is one of the best Dow stocks to buy, according to analysts. Boeing Co (NYSE:BA) and Airbus operate as a virtual duopoly in the large commercial jet aircraft market. It is a significant U.S. military contractor as well. Therefore, there is very little chance that its customers will abruptly stop purchasing its products in the near future. Rival Airbus has such a large backlog that it rejects some orders because it cannot produce the planes quickly enough. Consequently, regardless of its issues, Boeing will always have business at its exposure. Without a doubt, Boeing Co (NYSE:BA) faces difficulties, and it is uncertain if it can finance the next generation of narrow-body aircraft within the next ten years. Nevertheless, its multi-year backlog guarantees its long-term prospects. Likewise, investors rate Boeing as a Buy with an average price target of $197.83, implying a 23.74% upside potential. By the end of the second quarter of 2024, a notable 42 out of the 912 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had invested in Boeing Co (NYSE:BA). Overall BA ranks 2nd on our list of the best Dow stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of BA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than BA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

A packed theater of moviegoers watching a blockbuster film produced by the entertainment company. Average Upside Potential as of October 23: 15.91% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 92 The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) is an entertainment company that produces and distributes film and television video streaming content. It also operates the world’s largest theme park business, accounting for over 30% of its revenues. The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) has sought to alleviate concerns about its theme park business by announcing plans to invest $60 billion in the unit over the next 10 years. It plans to introduce four new cruise ships, lands, and rides across its global theme parks. In addition, the company is pursuing growth opportunities around content streaming with its Disney+ streaming service. The unit already has over 118 million subscribers, providing a new avenue for growth, especially in generating advertising revenues. The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) is a well-known brand, and even though the state of the economy has an impact on its short-term prospects, there are many reasons to be hopeful about the long term, particularly if it can continue to turn a profit from its streaming business, which is a challenge for many media companies. While trading at a price-to-earnings multiple of 18, The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) rewards investors with a 0.93% dividend yield. Additionally, analysts on Wall Street believe it is a strong buy with an average price target of $112.13, implying a 15.91% upside potential. In the second quarter, 92 hedge funds held positions in the company, collectively valuing their stakes at $4.76 billion. The substantial hedge fund interest underscores the company's attractiveness as a stable and promising investment opportunity. Meridian Funds, managed by ArrowMark Partners, released its second quarter 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said: “The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) operates a diversified entertainment business with theme parks, media networks, and streaming services. We own Disney because we believe its strong brand, valuable IP, and expanding streaming offerings will drive sustainable long-term growth. The company’s stock, however, underperformed in the quarter due to concerns about a slowdown in growth at its theme park division. While park revenue still grew by 10% year-over-year, management’s commentary suggested a moderation in post-pandemic demand and rising costs, leading to a disappointing outlook for park operating income in the second half of the year. This overshadowed the positive news that the company’s streaming segment, driven by strong subscriber growth at Disney+, reached profitability ahead of schedule. We held our position and will continue to monitor the performance of the theme park division.” Overall DIS ranks 5th on our list of the best Dow stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of DIS as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than DIS but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 15 AI News Investors Should Not Miss. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Informatica (NYSE:INFA) stands against the other AI stocks you should not miss. In a recent Tech Check program, CNBC’s Deirdre Bosa reports on how OpenAI’s head of Global Affairs is laying out his vision of what the government can do to keep American Artificial Intelligence on top. Currently leading policy at OpenAI, Chris Lehane talks about the AI policy at a time when everyone, including the industry and government, is trying to get their hands on AI policy. According to Lehane, the stakes in AI are higher than anything he has ever seen. He states how China has shared the idea of wanting to be the dominant player in AI by 2030, and that even though the US is currently in the lead, the fact that it stays on the top isn’t guaranteed. In an open letter to Washington, his Op-ed makes it clear that no matter who wins the election in less than two weeks, the US must be the leader in AI and the right way to do that is by laying the right infrastructure. The stakes involve the autocratic versus democratic development of AI, states Lehane, emphasizing the need for the U.S. to maintain its leadership in this field while ensuring that AI is built upon democratic values, principles, and benefits. READ ALSO: 20 AI News Investors Should Not Miss and Top 10 Trending AI Stocks in Q4 As we delve deeper into the critical issues concerning AI leadership and policy, it’s equally essential to examine the latest developments in the field that are shaping technology and industries. As reported by Tech Crunch, Anthropic’s Claude chatbot can now write and run JavaScript code itself. The company has launched a new analysis code tool for Claude which is currently in preview, enabling the AI to provide “mathematically precise and reproducible answers” by performing calculations and analyzing data from files such as spreadsheets and PDFs, and that too, with interactive visualizations. “Think of the analysis tool as a built-in code sandbox, where Claude can do complex math, analyze data, and iterate on different ideas before sharing an answer. Instead of relying on abstract analysis alone, it can systematically process your data — cleaning, exploring, and analyzing it step-by-step until it reaches the correct result”. Despite the rapid advancements in AI technology, there are growing concerns about its limitations and potential drawbacks at the same time. In recent news, OpenAI’s AI-powered transcription tool, Whisper, has been reportedly “hallucinating”. OpenAI may deem it to have near “human level robustness and accuracy”, but interviews with more than a dozen software engineers, developers, and academic researchers reveal that some of the invented text can include racial commentary, violent rhetoric, and even imagined medical treatments. A University of Michigan researcher found hallucinations in 80% of the audio transcriptions he examined during a study of public meetings. Such mistakes could have “really grave consequences,” particularly in hospital settings…Nobody wants a misdiagnosis” and that “There should be a higher bar.” With that, let's look at the 15 recent AI news that nobody should miss. Methodology For this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

(NYSE:INFA) is an artificial intelligence-powered platform that connects, manages, and unifies data across multi-vendor, multi-cloud, and hybrid systems at enterprise scale worldwide. On October 24, Informatica Inc. (NYSE:INFA) announced that Generative AI (GenAI) blueprints, which make it faster and easier for customers to build enterprise-grade GenAI applications on six prominent technology platforms, are now available. These blueprints are available at no cost at Informatica's Architecture, enabling customers to use the vendor's Intelligence Data Management Cloud (IDMC) platform in concert with AWS, Databricks, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, and Snowflake to develop GenAI capabilities. Key features include data quality and master data management (MDM), use of business glossary metadata and data governance, support for responsible AI, accelerated GenAI development via pre-built, ecosystem-specific iPaaS recipes, and enhanced scalability and efficiency with serverless runtime for integrating AI agents and RAG-chain executors. "A myriad of components must be brought together for GenAI development, including large language models, vector data management, prompt handling and more. These blueprints provide a prescriptive path for customers to unlock the potential of GenAI for their enterprise use cases. Informatica is continuing to simplify and streamline the process of delivering GenAI applications at scale by minimizing the do-it-yourself integration required. And, most importantly, we do so with AI-ready data that is relevant, responsible and robust.” -Rik Tamm-Daniels, Group Vice President of Strategic Ecosystems and Technology at Informatica.

Title: Jim Cramer Says ‘Transocean Ltd. (RIG) Went Bankrupt But The Stock Rebounded Dramatically From Those Lows’
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jim-cramer-says-transocean-ltd-074818275.html

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer on Tesla and Other Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Transocean Ltd. (NYSE:RIG) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer is talking about. Jim Cramer, host of Mad Money, emphasized the ongoing significance of fossil fuels in supporting technological advancements, even as investments in renewable energy continue to increase. He stated: “This is not just a grudge match between the old and the new, a battle of electric vehicles versus internal combustion. The truth is, fossil fuels are essential for a lot more than vehicles, like it or not.” READ ALSO Jim Cramer is Talking About These 12 Stocks and Jim Cramer’s Latest Stock Picks Cramer highlighted the growing energy demands of major tech companies, noting that the data centers they are constructing consume vast amounts of electricity. While these tech giants are making substantial investments in nuclear energy, he pointed out that this power source is unlikely to significantly impact data centers for at least another decade due to the complexities of building nuclear facilities and community resistance to having them nearby. “If we need more energy, we’re going to get it from what comes out of the ground … fossil fuels that will power the data center, specifically natural gas… You may be reluctant to invest in it, you might think who cares, but you need to know how vital all of this fossil fuel technology is to the growth of the Magnificent Seven.” Cramer also reflected on the shift in the U.S. energy landscape, recalling how the nation was once heavily reliant on OPEC for oil imports just two decades ago. Today, he pointed out, the U.S. produces over 13 million barrels per day, making it the largest oil producer globally and a net exporter. He mentioned the Permian Basin's unexpected resilience, continually producing despite earlier predictions of depletion. Cramer noted that the decline of OPEC has transformed the geopolitical landscape. He referenced the 1973 oil crisis, triggered by OPEC's retaliation against U.S. support for Israel, which led to stagflation and economic turmoil. In contrast, he pointed out that despite Israel's current conflict, the U.S. economy is not experiencing stagflation or recession, resulting instead in a bull market. He attributed this stability to the industry, saying: “... This industry that spent billions upon billions of dollars to try to be as low carbon as possible is the reason why oil prices have actually come down during this period. They've gotten so much production that OPEC is now powerless.” Turning his attention to the broader oil industry, Cramer explored the role of oil service companies that facilitate production, including offshore drillers. He recalled becoming optimistic about oil service stocks earlier in the year, anticipating higher energy prices but admitted that this expectation did not materialize due to economic concerns dampening oil and gas markets. Despite current investor reluctance toward oil service stocks, Cramer suggested that sentiment could shift over time, especially because of the Federal Reserve's recent rate cutting. “Now that the FED is our friend and more rate cuts are on the table, that's good news for the industry. I am not worried about the election either. If Trump wins, maybe we're back to that “drill baby drill” thing. If Harris wins, we get exactly what we've had the last four years. Not ideal for the industry but it's still led to record oil and gas production here in the United States.” Our Methodology For this article, we compiled a list of 14 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during his episodes of Mad Money on October 23 and 24. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the second quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of more than 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). An aerial view of an oil rig with drillers in hard hats working on the platform. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 42 Transocean Ltd. (NYSE:RIG) was recently discussed by Jim Cramer during his episode of Mad Money. Here’s what he had to say about the company: “We hardly ever talk about the smaller offshore operators like Transocean, symbol RIG, I always love that… Transocean has lost money for the past 7 years. Its stock has plunged from $30 a decade ago to just below $4… in 2020 when oil prices collapsed at the beginning of the pandemic. Every major offshore driller except for Transocean went bankrupt but the stock rebounded dramatically from those lows before peaking at eight bucks and changed in the summer of last year. Since then it's pulled back along with energy prices.” Cramer highlighted the company’s two impressive eighth-generation drillships that are operational in the Gulf of Mexico. He called them “technological marvels”. Cramer went on to say: “Second, Transocean’s in the news. Last night, Bloomberg reported that the company's exploring a merger with smaller rival, Seadrill. I don't really have much of an opinion on the potential deal but it signifies more confidence in the offshore space than I've seen in over a decade. By the way, of course, the industry needs consolidation. Honestly, this group has been so bad for so long that it's tough to recommend them here but if you strongly believe that the price of oil’s headed higher next year or the year after then Transocean is a winner. Personally, though, I don't want to bet on that.” Transocean (NYSE:RIG) offers offshore contract drilling services for oil and gas wells globally, operating a fleet of mobile offshore drilling units, including ultra-deepwater and harsh environment floaters. The company provides rigs, equipment, and crews to integrated and independent energy companies, as well as government-owned energy companies. On October 23, Bloomberg reported that Transocean (NYSE:RIG) has been engaged in discussions regarding a potential merger with rival offshore drilling contractor Seadrill Ltd. As oil explorers increasingly turn to offshore resources, these talks come at a time when the industry is experiencing renewed activity. Although conversations are ongoing about the possible structure of this merger, no final decision has been reached, and both companies may choose to continue operating independently.

We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer on Tesla and Other Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer is talking about. Jim Cramer, host of Mad Money, emphasized the ongoing significance of fossil fuels in supporting technological advancements, even as investments in renewable energy continue to increase. He stated: “This is not just a grudge match between the old and the new, a battle of electric vehicles versus internal combustion. The truth is, fossil fuels are essential for a lot more than vehicles, like it or not.” READ ALSO Jim Cramer is Talking About These 12 Stocks and Jim Cramer’s Latest Stock Picks Cramer highlighted the growing energy demands of major tech companies, noting that the data centers they are constructing consume vast amounts of electricity. While these tech giants are making substantial investments in nuclear energy, he pointed out that this power source is unlikely to significantly impact data centers for at least another decade due to the complexities of building nuclear facilities and community resistance to having them nearby. “If we need more energy, we’re going to get it from what comes out of the ground … fossil fuels that will power the data center, specifically natural gas… You may be reluctant to invest in it, you might think who cares, but you need to know how vital all of this fossil fuel technology is to the growth of the Magnificent Seven.” Cramer also reflected on the shift in the U.S. energy landscape, recalling how the nation was once heavily reliant on OPEC for oil imports just two decades ago. Today, he pointed out, the U.S. produces over 13 million barrels per day, making it the largest oil producer globally and a net exporter. He mentioned the Permian Basin's unexpected resilience, continually producing despite earlier predictions of depletion. Cramer noted that the decline of OPEC has transformed the geopolitical landscape. He referenced the 1973 oil crisis, triggered by OPEC's retaliation against U.S. support for Israel, which led to stagflation and economic turmoil. In contrast, he pointed out that despite Israel's current conflict, the U.S. economy is not experiencing stagflation or recession, resulting instead in a bull market. He attributed this stability to the industry, saying: “... This industry that spent billions upon billions of dollars to try to be as low carbon as possible is the reason why oil prices have actually come down during this period. They've gotten so much production that OPEC is now powerless.” Turning his attention to the broader oil industry, Cramer explored the role of oil service companies that facilitate production, including offshore drillers. He recalled becoming optimistic about oil service stocks earlier in the year, anticipating higher energy prices but admitted that this expectation did not materialize due to economic concerns dampening oil and gas markets. Despite current investor reluctance toward oil service stocks, Cramer suggested that sentiment could shift over time, especially because of the Federal Reserve's recent rate cutting. “Now that the FED is our friend and more rate cuts are on the table, that's good news for the industry. I am not worried about the election either. If Trump wins, maybe we're back to that “drill baby drill” thing. If Harris wins, we get exactly what we've had the last four years. Not ideal for the industry but it's still led to record oil and gas production here in the United States.” Our Methodology For this article, we compiled a list of 14 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during his episodes of Mad Money on October 23 and 24. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the second quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of more than 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A drilling rig in the desert with an orange sunset in the background. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 41 Cramer called Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) one of the “largest pure-play drillers” while mentioning that the stock has had a bad year and was down 20%. He further said: “With Wall Street expecting nearly 9% earnings growth, Halliburton is even more of a bargain trading at eight times next year's earnings estimates even though it's also expected to put up 9% growth in 2025. However, those valuations are only attractive if SLB and Halliburton can make the numbers. Otherwise, their stocks’ going to stay in the doghouse.” Cramer went on to say: “Now, the other major oil service company, Halliburton reports in two weeks, November 7. This stock has lagged SLB this year because Hal's more levered to the North American market rather than the international markets that are doing better. We'll see what Hal has to say in a fortnight, but if the outlook that SLB just gave us is correct, low growth for international, no growth or declines from North America then Hal should be in worse shape than SLB. Even though Halliburton remains an excellent operator, it's just the wrong business mix for the current environment.” Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) is a major provider of products and services in the global energy sector, specializing in production enhancement, cementing solutions, and comprehensive drilling support. For the second quarter, the company reported total revenues of $5.8 billion, with an operating margin of 18%. During the earnings call, CEO Jeffrey Allen Miller expressed optimism about steady growth for the company throughout the remainder of 2024. Management highlighted strong demand for the company's services in international markets, noting high activity levels and equipment shortages across all major basins. The environment supports expectations of approximately 10% revenue growth for the international business for the full year. However, the outlook for North America presents a different picture, as management anticipates a decline in revenues between 6% and 8% compared to the previous year due to reduced activity levels. Looking ahead to the third quarter, Halliburton’s (NYSE:HAL) Completion and Production division is expected to experience a sequential revenue decrease of 1% to 3%, with margins projected to drop by 75 to 125 basis points. In contrast, the Drilling and Evaluation division is forecasted to see a sequential revenue increase of 2% to 4%, accompanied by a rise in margins ranging from 25 to 75 basis points. Overall HAL ranks 11th on our list of stocks Jim Cramer is talking about. While we acknowledge the potential of HAL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

BlackRock and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) will invest in the $1.4 billion IPO, which will be the country's second-biggest stock offering this year, the sources told Reuters. Swiggy, Blackrock and CPPIB did not immediately respond to requests for comment outside business hours. Indian shares have fallen for four weeks in a row, the longest such losing run since August 2023, with the benchmark Nifty 50 index down more than 8 per cent from record highs hit on Sept. 27, due to persistent foreign selling. Hyundai India shares fell 7.2 per cent on their debut last week after retail investors gave a lukewarm reception amid concerns about a lofty valuation. Swiggy, backed by SoftBank and Prosus, was concerned to avoid a tepid response to its relatively large IPO, coming amid global uncertainty from the Nov. 5 U.S. presidential election, and decided to cut the valuation in consultation with investors, said one source, with direct knowledge of the company's plans. Swiggy does not want a "bad IPO", this person said. Its last funding round, led by Invesco, valued it at $10.7 billion in 2022. It competes with Zomato in India's online restaurant and cafe food deliveries sector, and both have made major bets on a boom in "quick-commerce," where groceries and other products are delivered in 10 minutes. Despite recent jitters, India's IPO market has been buoyant, with around 270 companies raising $12.57 billion so far this year, well above the $7.4 billion raised in all of 2023.

This change showed updates to third-quarter and 2024 forecasts, indicating that the guidance increase has been largely priced in. The firm noted a continued negative outlook for the sector overall. As of June 30, 2024, ZIM’s (NYSE:ZIM) total cash position, which includes cash, cash equivalents, and investments in various financial instruments, fell by $351 million, decreasing from $2.69 billion at the end of December 2023 to $2.34 billion. The company reported capital expenditures of $66 million for the second quarter of 2024, a rise from the $26 million spent during the same period in 2023. Additionally, its net debt position grew to $3.25 billion by the end of June 2024, up from $2.31 billion at the close of the previous year, showing an increase of $936 million. However, the company has raised its full-year guidance for 2024, projecting Adjusted EBITDA in the range of $2.6 billion to $3.0 billion, and Adjusted EBIT between $1.45 billion and $1.85 billion.

Title: Michael Saylor Urges Microsoft To Consider Bitcoin As Path To Next Trillion-Dollar Growth

Time Published: 2024-10-27T05:30:27Z

Following Microsoft’s recent proposal to shareholders to consider investing in Bitcoin, Michael Saylor, co-founder of MicroStrategy and a prominent BTC advocate, publicly encouraged Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella to embrace the largest cryptocurrency as a means to future growth. In a post on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), Saylor stated, “If you want to make the next trillion dollars for the Microsoft shareholders, call me,” emphasizing the financial potential of BTC investments. Saylor’s company, MicroStrategy, has made headlines for its aggressive Bitcoin acquisition strategy over the past four years, significantly boosting its stock price. On Friday, MicroStrategy’s shares hit a 25-year high of $245, reflecting a substantial stock rally driven specifically by BTC holdings strategy approach. Even Microsoft’s report on its assessment of investing in BTC pointed out that MicroStrategy’s stock has outperformed the company’s by an impressive 313% this year despite only doing a fraction of the business. In its report, Microsoft noted the success of MicroStrategy’s investment approach, highlighting that its stock has seen substantial gains thanks to its BTC holdings. Interestingly, some analysts speculate that Microsoft’s new focus on BTC investment might be influenced by its second-largest shareholder company, BlackRock, which has recently entered the crypto market with the approval of their spot Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds in January and July of this year respectively. Saylor has ambitious plans for MicroStrategy, including establishing the company as a leading Bitcoin or “merchant bank” capable of creating various BTC capital market instruments, such as stocks, convertibles and fixed income products. As previously reported by Bitcoinist, Saylor envisions a future where MicroStrategy holds $100 billion to $150 billion in Bitcoin through these financial structures. MicroStrategy owns over 252,000 BTC, valued at approximately $15.7 billion, acquired largely through debt financing. Saylor stated at the time: This is the most valuable asset in the world. The ultimate goal is to be the leading Bitcoin bank, or merchant bank, or you can call it a BTC financial company. Saylor’s strategy remains steadfast: “We just keep buying more Bitcoin,” he asserts. He believes that BTC’s value will soar, predicting that it could reach $13 million per coin by 2045 as it captures a larger share of global financial capital. This perspective contrasts sharply with other companies like Tesla, which have utilized Bitcoin gains for operational funding or fee extraction. At the time of writing, the largest cryptocurrency on the market is trading at $67,800, recording a price recovery of 8% in the last two weeks and over 95% year-to-date.

Title: Is BlackRock Propping Up Bitcoin Price? Market Analyst Shares Details
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/is-blackrock-propping-up-bitcoin-price-market-analyst-shares-details/
Time Published: 2024-10-27T02:30:10Z

Bitcoin has faced a turbulent week, with price swings ranging from a local high of $69,500 to a low of $65,000, cooling off after weeks of bullish excitement. Now, BTC is consolidating just below the crucial $70,000 level, a price point seen as a key threshold for the next major move. Despite the price cooling, top investors and analysts are keeping a close watch on market dynamics. CryptoQuant analyst and prominent investor Maartunn recently shared a chart highlighting a significant increase in BlackRock’s balance and balance changes in BTC, suggesting that the financial giant may be strategically propping up the market. This insight into BlackRock’s growing involvement has sparked new optimism among investors, who view institutional support as a powerful foundation for Bitcoin’s potential rally. The company’s increased presence in the BTC market, as shown by Maartunn’s analysis, implies a deepening commitment that could bring greater stability and strength to BTC prices in the coming weeks. As Bitcoin stabilizes below $70,000, these signals from large players like BlackRock add an extra layer of anticipation to the market, with analysts speculating that their influence could propel BTC through critical resistance levels. Bitcoin is approaching a pivotal moment, with market sentiment strongly favoring a push to new all-time highs in the near future. Analysts and investors are growing increasingly optimistic as ETF flows have shown consistent positivity over the past few weeks, bolstering expectations for BTC’s upward trajectory. Price action, too, has been resilient, consolidating near critical resistance levels and signaling underlying strength in the market. A recent analysis by top analyst Maartunn sheds light on an intriguing dynamic involving BlackRock’s BTC holdings. Maartunn shared a chart revealing BlackRock’s Bitcoin balance and its net balance changes, indicating that the financial giant may be subtly propping up the market. The chart highlights a notable trend: positive balance changes at BlackRock have overwhelmingly outweighed negative ones, suggesting a sustained accumulation phase. This pattern implies that BlackRock may be positioning itself as a key BTC market maker, possibly providing liquidity and contributing to price stability in a highly volatile market. Such actions by BlackRock could prove to be a major catalyst for Bitcoin’s price, as institutional involvement historically encourages investor confidence and mitigates market downturns. With positive ETF flows and strategic accumulation from major players like BlackRock, the current setup points toward an environment primed for bullish movement. If BTC continues to hold these levels and institutional backing remains strong, the stage could be set for a rally that takes BTC to uncharted territory. Bitcoin is currently trading at $67,000 and appears to be forming a bullish flag pattern, which could potentially propel the price higher in the near term. The price has successfully held above the critical $65,000 level, providing a solid foundation for a bullish outlook as it indicates strong buyer interest. This key threshold has acted as support, preventing further declines and reinforcing the optimism among traders. However, the next week will be crucial for Bitcoin. If the price fails to break above the $70,000 mark, a retracement to lower demand levels is likely. Such a move could test the 200-day moving average, currently situated at $63,275. Should BTC drop below the $65,000 mark, this area would become a focal point for traders seeking strong demand, as it has historically served as a significant support level. Maintaining the bullish flag pattern and overcoming resistance at $70,000 will be vital for sustaining upward momentum. Traders will closely monitor price action to determine whether BTC can continue its ascent or if a pullback to lower levels is on the horizon.

Title: McCanns to push Balmoral stake near to 80% in take-private plan

Full Content:
The McCann family, once synonymous with Fyffes, are pursuing a plan to take Balmoral International Land fully private, in a deal that will see the total stake of vehicles controlled by them close to 80 per cent. Balmoral, which has traded on a grey market operated by stockbroking firms since it was delisted from the Dublin stock exchange in 2011, issued a circular to shareholders last week saying it planned a mandatory buyback of stock held by investors holding fewer than 25,000 shares. They account for a combined 22.4 per cent stake in the company. The deal is being priced at €10.50 a share, representing a 110 per cent premium to where it last changed hands on the grey market in November, before stockbrokers stopped facilitating trades due to the burden of paperwork. There is also no realistic prospect of it rejoining the stock market “within any foreseeable time frame”, the company added. However, the price is only 56 per cent of Balmoral’s €18.72 reported net asset value per share as of the end of June. The buyback will cost €18 million in total – equating to the company’s current net cash position. It will increase direct McCann family stakes and indirect holdings, through vehicles they control, to a combined 79 per cent from just over 61 per cent currently. Balmoral said it had an “unusually large number of shareholders” for a small company, with nearly 5,000 investors – or 95 per cent of the total – holding fewer than 500 shares. Many of the stakes are small and had already been uneconomical to trade for some time. “The company continues to receive enquiries from shareholders who are keen to understand how they can unlock the value in their shares now that there is no active market in the company’s shares,” Balmoral chairman Carl McCann said in the document. “Having returned cash of €2.6 million to shareholders in 2023 and following further property sales this year the group is now in a net cash position, and on 30 September 2024 had gross cash of €47.5 million which is offset by debt of €29.5 million, giving net cash of €18 million.” An extraordinary general meeting to approve the matter will be held on November 21st in the Dublin offices of the company’s solicitors, Arthur Cox. However, this will be a mere formality, as 80.4 per cent of shareholders have already given “irrevocable undertakings” to vote in favour of the transaction, Balmoral said. The company was originally named Blackrock International Land when it was spun out by Fyffes in 2006 as a separate publicly-quoted. It was delisted in 2011 following a slump in its share price during the property crash, but continues to have thousands of legacy shareholders that have remained on board since the stock market exit. The McCann family sold their decades-old shares in Fyffes in 2017 to Japanese conglomerate Sumitomo. The Tokyo-based firm subsequently sold the 30 per cent interest in Balmoral it inherited to a vehicle led by the McCanns. Mr McCann is also executive chairman of Dole Plc, the Irish-based but New York-listed fresh produce company created in 2021 through the merger of Dole Foods with former Total Produce. Dole and Fyffes are among Balmoral’s main tenants. The fair value of Balmoral’s investment assets, comprised of industrial and warehouse buildings, offices and mixed-use land, edged up to €146.3 million in June from €138 million in December, the company disclosed in the circular.

Title: 3 Big Differences – Nvidia Is Poised To Take Over From Apple
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnwerner/2024/10/26/3-big-differences--nvidia-is-poised-to-take-over-from-apple/

Microchip and Nvidia logo displayed on a phone screen are seen in this multiple exposure ... [+] illustration photo taken in Krakow, Poland on April 10, 2023. (Photo by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Nvidia finally poked its head briefly above the stock value of the dominant Apple empire this week, before settling back down to market value of $3.47 trillion with Apple’s value at $3.52 trillion. Reuters reporting shows how close this is, with a chart showing Nvidia’s rise against Apple and Microsoft, the other two dominant tech companies. “The Silicon Valley chipmaker is the dominant supplier of processors used in AI computing, and the company has become the biggest winner in a race between Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta Platforms and other heavyweights, to dominate the emerging technology,” write Reuters reporters Sruthi Shankar and Noel Randewich. “Known since the 1990s as a designer of processors for videogames, Nvidia's stock has risen about 18% so far in October, with a string of gains coming after OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, announced a funding round of $6.6 billion.” Microsoft now rests slightly below the other two, with around $3.18 trillion in value. A look back shows that Nvidia also won out temporarily over the same competitors back in June of this year; prior to that, the firm’s stock price was under $100 per share, until it finally spiked early this year and continued to rise. Sticking at around $140 per share, this giant is now poised to earn its crown as the most valuable company in the world. What this represents for the market is a major change from one kind of technology to another. You could express this three different ways: You could say that Apple makes consumer-facing technology, while Nvidia makes ‘back end’ server/hardware technology. You could say that Apple makes endpoint technology, where Nvidia makes supply technology. Or you could say that Apple makes devices that you can use, where Nvidia makes hardware that allows AI to think. With items likes A100 GPU, Nvidia is a dominant producer of AI hardware. And everybody wants a piece of this, from Microsoft and Blackrock, to all kinds of other stakeholders who are getting in on the AI revolution. While Nvidia’s own chips are powerhouses in their own right, analysts show that many companies are investing in their own hardware in the form of custom chips known in the industry as application-specific integrated circuits or ASICs. Some of those closest to the phenomenon cite companies like Broadcom (AVGO) and others as competitor companies that may rise as their clients look for ASIC technology. However, Nvidia is also making its own play in the ASIC market, and will apparently open sores this technology. “There has been speculation that fixed function application-specific circuits (ASICs) might one day eclipse NVIDIA’s GPU-centric approach,” writes Karl Fruend at Moor Insights and Strategy. “Now NVIDIA itself seems to have embraced this approach, albeit in a limited fashion, announcing its own ASIC technology for Deep Learning acceleration. In a surprising and bold move, the company also announced that it will open source this technology to enable others to build chips using this technology.” Maybe that pivot will help them address one of the major threats to their dominance in the market. In any case, it’s a timely piece of news, because what it shows is that AI is ascendant. We’re watching this technology blossom right before our eyes, in real time, and after a few years of relative obscurity, Nvidia seems to have won out – at least for now. One Community. Many Voices.

Title: Ethereum Continues Losing Ground To Bitcoin With ETH/BTC Ratio at Multi-Year Lows

Ethereum (ETH) continues to perform poorly against Bitcoin (BTC) as the second-largest digital asset by reported market cap hit new multi-year lows against the top cryptocurrency. Today, Ethereum’s native ETH token slid further against BTC, recording a low of 0.0365 and erasing all its gains against Bitcoin since April 2021. This multi-year low against BTC is bound to dampen the expectations of ETH permabulls. In December 2021, ETH reached a local high of 0.0865 against BTC. However, since then, the smart contract token has been on a continual downward trajectory, declining by almost 58% against the premier digital asset. Notably, the last monthly green candle that ETH posted against BTC was in May 2024. It is highly likely that by the end of October, ETH will have posted five consecutive monthly red candles against Bitcoin. On a year-to-date (YTD) basis, ETH is down by over 30% against BTC. Interestingly, within the last three months, the ETH/BTC trading pair has declined by over 22%, indicating that major losses against BTC are more recent. While various factors could be blamed for ETH’s lackluster price performance, a major reason is the rapidly increasing competition from rival smart contract blockchains such as Solana (SOL). The chart below shows that SOL has been on an upward trajectory against ETH after a brief consolidation in June 2024. On a YTD basis, SOL has recorded almost 60% gains against ETH. At the time of writing, the SOL/ETH ratio is trading close to a new all-time high (ATH) at 0.069. Although Ethereum adoption continues to grow – boosted by the recent Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) – the effects are not entirely reflected in the price action of the native ETH token. A recent report found that more than 34 million ETH – close to 30% of its supply – is currently staked. Despite the lower circulating supply as a result of staking, ETH’s price continues to perform poorly against other digital assets. In addition, the extraordinary growth witnessed by Ethereum layer-2 (L2) solutions such as Optimism, Arbitrum, and Base, has taken the attention away from the smart contract platform. In August, Justin Bons, founder of Cyber Capital said “Ethereum is dying while L2’s dance on its grave.” Despite the growing pessimism toward its price action, ETH whales remain unfazed as they continue to scoop more tokens to benefit from potential future price appreciation. Recent analysis found that Ethereum whales now control about 43% of ETH’s entire supply. Similarly, earlier this month, asset manager BlackRock was found to be selling its BTC holdings for ETH, suggesting the firm’s bullish outlook on the token. At press time, ETH trades at $2,532, up 0.2% in the past 24 hours. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: BlackRock Can't Stop Buying Bitcoin, $292 Million in One Sweep

U.Today - Top investment asset management firm BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) has stayed on top of its Bitcoin (BTC) acquisition game. On Friday, it relegated the other spot Bitcoin ETF issuers to the background by scooping up $292 million worth of the flagship digital currency. On Oct. 24, BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF stood out, receiving the bulk of inflows, with $165.54 million. This suggests growing investors’ confidence and interest in the firm's crypto ETF products. Compared to Grayscale, which pegged its sponsor fee at 1.5%, BlackRock asks for only 0.25%. This lower fee structure could serve as the advantage that makes IBIT more attractive to institutional and retail investors, especially those who wish to balance cost efficiency and exposure. Additionally, it reflects institutional investors' commitment to getting a slice of the highly speculative crypto market through ETFs. On Friday, ARK 21Shares’ ARKB registered $33.4 million in inflows, while Invesco, Franklin Templeton, Valkyrie and WisdomTree’s products recorded $0 inflows. Generally, the Bitcoin ETF ecosystem is expanding at a fast rate. There is an expectation that Bitcoin ETFs will surpass 1 million BTC in holdings to outshine Satoshi Nakamoto. The total ETF holdings represent 97% of the one million BTC target, and BlackRock is leading the issuers. This article was originally published on U.Today

Data from Bloomberg shows that of the 575 ETFs launched this year, 14 of the top 30 products have been either new Bitcoin or Ethereum funds, with the top four spots owned by Bitcoin funds.

Includes 6 of top 10. There are also 2 MSTR-related ETFs in top 30. Crypto appetite from tradfi is real. pic.twitter.com/DmD6f5zJ1P — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) October 23, 2024 ETFs are popular investment vehicles that trade on stock exchanges. They allow investors to buy and sell shares that track the price of anything from the S&P 500 and gold to Bitcoin and real estate firms. In January, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the Bitcoin products, allowing 10 such funds to start trading on American stock exchanges after a decade of denials. The investment vehicles have been widely popular, attracting billions of dollars in months in flows. Last week, they collectively crossed the $20 billion mark—smashing expectations by taking just 10 months to do what gold ETFs did over five years. The reason for the fast money, according to Bloomberg Intelligence ETF research analyst James Seyffart, is partly down to investors who had wanted to invest in Bitcoin for some time, but didn't have a safe or easy way before the approval of the ETFs. Now that the ETFs are trading, that demand is rapidly entering the market. “I think it was partly pent-up demand,” he told Decrypt. “But it’s also new demand as people are learning more.” He added that traditional financial institutions are interested in the products too—including hedge funds involved in futures trading. “That has helped improve flows and demand,” he said, adding that hedge funds have been going long on the ETFs and then selling the futures contracts. Massive institutions—including Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs—now have exposure to Bitcoin via the new products. The price of Bitcoin even hit a new all-time high in March following their approvals. But the Ethereum counterparts haven’t had as much luck thus far. The SEC approved the ETFs for the second-biggest cryptocurrency—reluctantly, it appeared—in May. They haven’t done nearly as much in terms of inflows since trading began in July. This is partially because Grayscale’s Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) previously operated like a closed-end fund rather than an ETF before July. Its subsequent conversion means that investors who previously had cash locked up in the fund have fast been redeeming shares—leading to massive outflows. So far, $3 billion has left the fund, bringing the total flows for all nine Ethereum ETFs currently trading to negative $472.7 million, Farside data shows. However, that doesn’t mean demand won't pick up. Investors have thrown cash at the other products, and that could mean a turnaround is on the horizon. “It’s just that the outflows from ETHE are overwhelming the inflows to these other [Ethereum] ETFs,” added Seyffart. “For now.” Edited by Andrew Hayward Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2024 Decrypt Media, Inc.

Title: Blizzard Kicks off WoW 20th and Warcraft 30th Anniversary Celebrations

Hey, you want to buy a $90 Brutosaur mount? The 20th anniversary celebrations are kicking off for World of Warcraft, which is also being joined to the 30th anniversary of the Warcraft franchise as a whole, and Blizz wants you to be able to celebrate the milestone in any number of ways, including handing them nearly a C note for a digital mount… because greed deserves representation too, doesn’t it? I mean, we’re coming up on the 15th anniversary of the Celestial Steed as well, the very first cash shop mount, the original greed steed… if we leave out that Runes of Magic mount from 2009. Blizz never met an idea they wouldn’t snatch and call their own! If Runes of Magic failed, it was probably in pricing too low. Why charge $10 when $25 is possible? Am I getting off course and editorializing too much already? That is the value add you come here for, isn’t it? Okay, let’s talk about the celebrations. WoW Turns 20 Blizz has the event broken out in their post nicely enough, so I am just going to use that. Two can play this stealing game Blizz! Here’s what you can look forward to during the WoW 20th Anniversary Celebration: Players level 10 and up will receive the quest, “Another Timely Invitation,” inviting them to the celebration in Tanaris outside the Caverns of Time. You’ll speak with Yllana to turn in your quest and then pick up some one-time quests to learn more about the event. All of which means you need to find the portal to the Caverns of Time… there is such a thing up in the old tower in Stormwind… and head on out of the cavern where you’ll find a fair laid out, with that big sword stuck in Azeroth visible in the distance. Did that show up with Battle for Azeroth? I forget. The event with the silhouette of the sword in the distance I found it a bit disorienting… but I also play WoW Classic with the old UI and so the whole new UI layout and such is different enough to require me to relearn a lot or go away. I did a couple of the intro quests and then went away. So that is the kick off of the big event. Over in WoW Classic… we have nothing on the calendar. If you’re playing 14 year old WoW you don’t get to celebrate 20 years. I was also a bit disappointed that, during my brief visit to retail, I did not see the $90 Brutorsaur mount out and about anywhere. I thought surely there would be one in the middle of the square in the grand tradition of “that guy on the mount” in Azeroth. But maybe $90 was too dear. Or maybe I just don’t go to the places where people show off those sorts of things in retail anymore. Stormwind is pretty old school at this point. A pity. It is a handsome mount, and even comes with an auctioneer and a mailbox, so you can do your business on the go. This baby will hold so many auctions If you want a better deal… for specific definitions of “better” I suppose… for just $30 they’ll sell you eight special edition mounts to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the franchise. I guess it always comes back to commerce. Anyway, the event runs out into the new year. Lots of time to partake. The actual 20th anniversary of the game is a month out still and I suspect there will be an achievement for logging in closer to that date as well. We shall see. Well, as we know from economics class, things are worth what people are willing to pay for them. So someone out there must be that into WoW that an occasional Benjamin is reasonable. Or maybe, based on your observation, $90 is a bridge too far and we will soon see “special discounts” … LikeLike Might be that we need to know where to look, like in TWW zones or something. I read that if you convert the mount to Canadian dollars and include tax the mount is worth $150 (Canadian). That’s… Yikes. LikeLike The $90 mount people are probably standing on a mailbox in whatever location is the “new” level capped watering hole. I guess it’s for the best that Blizz got rid of the ability to /spit on people, because I’d imagine that people would be doing that a lot. As for the event, apparently it consists of a ton of FOMO-induced weekly events, so I guess getting that old “gotta do all the chores” feeling from Legion onward is what they were aiming for to bring that nostalgia. I have heard through some YouTube posts here and there that there were some really broken pieces to the Retail patch that dropped, so I guess THAT is part of the 20th anniversary experience too. But yes, the irony that there’s an “original” version of the game available in Classic Era as well as a Cataclysm Classic version of the game that neither actually have a celebration in place says a lot about what Blizz thinks of the entire Classic endeavor. Even just a short note saying “thanks” from Blizzard Entertainment –like back in the old days– would have been nice. LikeLike I saw an image online of a pack of these mounts standing on top of something to obscure it from other players… because that is always what happened. But I think it was out in the TWW zones, which I do not have access to and I wasn’t interested enough to go find them even if I did have access. LikeLike I’d have to say that compared to anniversary celebrations I’ve seen in quite a number of other games over the years, that does not look like a very impressive selection. But then, I don’t really play WoW so I don’t have the context to judge. LikeLike I can assure you there are plenty of Brutosaurs about in Dornogal (the War Within capital). While players always wail and gnash their teeth about this kind of thing, there are enough of them out there who’ll happily buy it instantly to make it worth it for Blizz. I may write my own post about the anniversary event at some point, but it’s early days. It has some fun activities, but based on how it was described I kind of expected more. And the limitations on earning the event currency definitely feel heavy-handed. LikeLike This is one of the things that disgust me the most about recent monetization trends (I say “recent”, but of course it’s been going on for a while now)… As you know I’m not against cash shop stuff per se, as long as it doesn’t interfere with gameplay too much. But when there are holidays and anniverseries up YOU, dear devs, are supposed to give ME nice stuff, not the other way around! LikeLike Δ Email Address: Email Posts to Me!

ERIC KIM Benzinga has extensively covered recent Bitcoin trends, highlighting the cryptocurrency’s resilience and investor interest. As Bitcoin currently hovers around $68,000, analysts on Benzinga see strong underlying support and potential for further gains. They suggest that the upcoming U.S. election could be a pivotal factor, with predictions that a Trump victory might push Bitcoin to $80,000 by year-end due to expected crypto-friendly policies, while a Harris victory might lead to a short-term dip before resuming an uptrend . Additionally, Benzinga notes that October has historically been a strong month for Bitcoin, often termed “Uptober,” with the coin gaining around 8.9% so far this month. High inflows into Bitcoin ETFs also signal robust institutional interest, with companies like BlackRock leading the way, driving positive market sentiment and solidifying support at key price levels .

Title: Spot Bitcoin ETFs Demand At 6-Month High, BTC Capped Below $70,000

Bitcoin prices are steady above the $66,000 support when writing on October 25. While confidence is high, the coin is still trending below the psychological round at $70,000. It has yet to shake off sellers in early October. However, looking at emerging spot Bitcoin ETF trends, this is about to change. The latest analysis by Ki Young Ju of CryptoQuant on October 25 shows that the demand for these crypto derivative products has risen over the last 30 days. The uptick has seen the demand for spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States rise to a six-month high, attracting over 64,900 BTC in net flows. Net flows, which consider total inflows and outflows over the test period, can be used to gauge institutional interest. Whenever it rises, coupled specifically with expanding inflows, it means more institutions are getting exposure to the digital gold. The more institutional interest increases, the more likely BTC will shoot higher. Soso Value data shows that issuers in the United States collectively manage over $66 billion. On October 24, investors bought over $188 million of BTC through their issuers. So far, BlackRock, through its IBIT, is the largest issuer, controlling over $27 billion of BTC. Over the past few months, Grayscale’s GBTC has seen massive outflows. On October 24, over $7 million of BTC were redeemed from GBTC. There are high hopes that the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States paved the way for institutions to drive prices. Before then, most found exposure to BTC via approved Trusts, some offered by Grayscale. Meanwhile, some institutions bought MicroStrategy stocks as their performance reflected BTC, given the public company’s heavy investment in the digital asset. According to Bitcoin Treasuries, MicroStrategy owns over 250,000 BTC, the biggest haul of any public company in the United States and worldwide. Over the years since their strategy of regularly stacking BTC, its stock, MSTR, has outperformed top stocks and indices in the United States. Only time will tell whether BTC bulls have what it takes to break above $70,000. The round number marks September highs. If Bitcoin builds on the rejection of lower prices on October 24, it could find the momentum necessary to define the short-term trajectory. A firm close above this psychological resistance line paves the way for a retest of $72,000 and all-time highs. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: Here are the make-or-break factors for bitcoin after a blistering rally so far in 2024

Time Published: 2024-10-26T12:26:01Z
Full Content:
It's been a momentous year for bitcoin, with big price gains to match some of the most important developments for the token in years. It started with the Securities and Exchange Commission's groundbreaking approval of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds in January. That made it easier for average investors to buy and trade the crypto, and helped mainstream the token via fund offerings from asset management titans like BlackRock and Fidelity. In April, bitcoin underwent its scheduled "halving," reducing the amount of tokens miners are rewarded by half. The event, which happens roughly every four years, is bullish as it cuts the supply of new tokens to the market. The cryptocurrency has surged 57% in 2024, and is up by over 90% in the last year. Investors and analysts are still bullish, eyeing more gains in the year to come even as election uncertainty looms. "I'm really bullish for 2025," Matt Hougan, Chief Investment Officer at Bitwise Asset Management, told Business Insider. "There are all these positive trends." Still, other market pros told BI that there are some headwinds building that could cause the rally to stumble. Here are the make-or-break factors to watch. Hougan pointed to a broad set of monetary easing cycles from central banks as a key bullish driver for bitcoin. Central bank easing typically boosts risk assets like crypto. When interest rate volatility was high over the summer, Bitcoin slumped as investors poured into defensive areas of the market. The Federal Reserve's big rate cut last month fueled a bitcoin rally, and crypto experts say the broader central bank easing cycle that's kicking off around the world should reinforce the gains. CoinDesk Indices' Andy Baehr says that monetary easing should fuel the cryptocurrency's rise in the months ahead. "This is something the market can count on for months or quarters. The mood changed right away," Baehr said, pointing to the immediate rise in bitcoin's price as well as an increase in other indicators of strength like rising exchange volumes. Less bullish for crypto would be a more muscular regulatory approach to the market, and uncertainty about the oversight regime is a headwind. "The worst outcome for crypto is one that sustains uncertainty around the direction of crypto legislation and regulation," Hougan said, adding that the election outcomes could throw a wrench into the equation. "We have a hunch of what a Harris administration or a Trump administration would do, but we know that those promises don't always come through, and you can have harsh results," Hougan said, pointing to when crypto was excited for Gary Gensler to take over as SEC chair before proving strict on crypto regulation. Hougan said, though, that he thinks bitcoin appears to be in the clear with regulators after the SEC approved the spot ETFs. The US presidential election also remains top of mind for crypto investors. While both Trump and Harris are seen as pro-crypto, it's been Trump who has embraced the market publicly in recent months, speaking at events and even launching his own NFTs. This has led the market to believe he'd be the one to truly allow it to flourish and bitcoin has rallied as Trump's odds of winning the election have risen. A Trump win could shoot bitcoin to $125,000 by the end of the year, a jump of over 80% from Friday's prices, according to Standard Charter analyst Geoff Kendrick. But even if odds shift in favor of Vice President Kamala Harris, bitcoin will likely still rally, Hougan said. He says a Trump win would be an accelerant for crypto in the few months after the election, but bitcoin will likely do well in the long term regardless, as Harris appears to be friendlier to crypto than President Joe Biden. "Two years ago, crypto was talking about Sam Bankman Fried and the biggest financial crime of all time, and crypto was completely toxic. Today, both presidential campaigns are posturing in positive ways toward the crypto industry," Hougan said. After the election, bitcoin's path looks less clear. As markets fixate on the result of the November contest, there's no clear catalyst for further gains after that. "Sharks need to swim to survive. If they stop they will die," Hougan said, adding, "Bitcoin is sort of like that. It is, in the end, a narrative- and growth-focused entity." He says, though, that the narrative could point toward greater institutional adoption, or toward more potentially real-world applications for crypto. Among the bullish drivers, the spot ETFs that drove a rally earlier this year will likely still have a positive impact. "I think Bitcoin ETF flows will accelerate in Q4 and then accelerate again in 2025. And I don't think that's priced into the market or expected," Hougan said. Baehr said the rising prominence of bitcoin ETFs and their backing from firms like BlackRock will help the crypto push further into the mainstream. "I think that the asset class now is able to participate in more serious conversations, and so the price of bitcoin is just going to enjoy that universal expansion and that network enrichment," Baehr said.

Title: Tokenized treasuries are red-hot, but face struggles to dethrone stablecoins
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/tokenized-treasuries-are-redhot-but-face-struggles-to-dethrone-stablecoins-3684473
Time Published: 2024-10-26T11:25:20Z

Investing.com -- Creating digital versions, or tokenizing real world assets on blockchains has been at the cutting edge of demonstrating crypto's use case. And now tokenised treasuries are enjoying their moment in the spotlight as an alternative yield to stablecoins, but these emerging digital assets face significant hurdles toward wider adoption needed to dethrone stablecoins. Tokenized treasuries -- the digital versions of Treasury bonds created on a blockchain such as Ethereum -- have racked up a market cap of nearly $2.5 billion, up from around $800M since the turn of the year, according to data from tracker RWA.xyz. "This universe of tokenized treasuries has been growing fast over the past year approaching $2.4bn. And, although much smaller than the $180bn universe of traditional stablecoins, their fast growth has the potential to challenge stablecoin's dominance in the future," analysts at JPMorgan said in a recent note. The need for yield-bearing alternatives to major stablecoins such as Tether and USDC/USD, which typically don't offer interest or share reserve yields, has been driving demand for tokenized treasuries. It makes good regulatory sense for stablecoins to avoid offering interest to its users as doing so would attract further regulatory restrictions, requiring compliance with securities law, JPMorgan said, "thus hindering their current seamless and permissionless use as source of collateral in the crypto ecosystem." Stablecoin users, however, aren't sitting idle willing to stomach the opportunity cost of holding yield-bearing assets. They have been employing various strategies to earn yield on their stablecoins. But these strategies such as secured lending, unsecured lending, basis trade "involve risk and ceding control and custody of their balances," the analysts said. With U.S. Treasury yields still at multi-year highs, and now expected to remain higher for longer as U.S. economic exceptionalism continues, tokenized government debt appears to be scratching the 'need for yield' itch and could potentially continue to pry away dollars from stablecoins. Tokenized treasuries offer several advantages over traditional stablecoins. They provide yield to users without the need for risky trading or lending strategies, not require users to cede control or custody of their assets. The market for tokenized treasuries has also been spurred by institutional investors launching tokenized funds, allowing investors access to on-chain offerings with 24/7 liquidity. Blackrock (NYSE:BLK) launched its first tokenized fund, BUIDL, earlier this year on the Ethereum blockchain, allowing investors to redeem their shares or BUIDL tokens for USDC stablecoin through a smart contract at any time, without the need for an intermediary. Some tokenized funds including Blackrock's BUIDL, which has amassed a market cap of nearly $0.6 million since its launch in April, are also looking to steal stablecoins' lunch in a key market: the crypto derivatives market. Stablecoins tend to be used as collateral in crypto derivatives trades, with Tether Holdings’s stablecoin USDT and Circle Internet Financial's USDC among the most widely used tokens for derivatives collateral on exchanges, with market caps of $120B and $34B, respectively. But this very advantage, the offering of yield, that tokenized treasuries are able to dangle in front of investors poses a major headwind in their quest to steal sizable portion stablecoins' lunch. "Tokenized treasuries fall under securities law which restrict offerings to accredited investors, thus inhibiting broader market adoption," the analysts said. BlackRock's BUIDL, for example, has high entry barriers with a minimum investment of $5 million and restriction on offering these products to accredited investors. Blackrock's big push to persuade cryptocurrency exchanges to more widely use its digital token shows there is potential to partly replace traditional stablecoins as collateral in crypto derivative trading, but the liquidity or the lack thereof (relative to that of stablecoins), suggest these new kids on the crypto derivatives market block aren't likely to dominate any time soon. This regulatory hurdle suggests that stablecoins -- boasting a market cap nearing $180B across multiple blockchains and centralized exchanges, ensuring traders receive low transaction costs even for large transactions -- aren't at risk of losing the significant advantage they hold over tokenized treasuries in terms of liquidity, JPMorgan said. This deep liquidity, which is key to seamless trading, implies that tokenized treasuries, with a market cap of around $2.4B, would "eventually replace only a fraction of the stablecoin universe," JPMorgan said. While the bar to knock stablecoins off their perch is likely to remain high, tokenized Treasuries are expected to continue to grow by potentially replacing "non-yield-bearing stablecoins in DAO treasuries, liquidity pools, and idle cash with crypto venture funds."

Title: Is Copa Holdings, S.A. (CPA) the Best Airline Stock to Buy According to Hedge Funds?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Airline Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Copa Holdings, S.A. (NYSE:CPA) stands against the other airline stocks. We also dive deep into trends in the commercial aviation industry, especially the impact the return of international travel to pre-pandemic levels has had on the airline industry. The coronavirus pandemic wreaked havoc across the global airline industry. According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), industry revenues slumped from $838 billion in 2019 to $384 billion a year later, registering a 54.1% downfall. However, the market has gradually recovered over the last few years and is on track for solid growth as international travel resumes worldwide. READ ALSO: 10 Best Airline Stocks To Buy According To Short Sellers and 10 Worst Airline Stocks To Buy According to Short Sellers. A report by UN Tourism in January this year stated that international tourism was recorded in 2023 at 88% of pre-pandemic levels, and is on track to return to levels before the coronavirus struck. The IATA anticipates global airline revenue to reach $996 billion in 2024, 19% higher than in 2019 and 1.5 times higher than the pandemic low of 2020. The global travel recovery has been led by the Middle East, the strongest tourism market in 2023, as it welcomed 22% more travelers than it did in 2019, becoming the only region to prevail over pandemic levels. Europe reached 94% of the levels in 2019, while Africa stood at 96%. Asia Pacific has been rather slow, recovering only 65% of pre-pandemic levels as of last year. The uptick in international travel is yielding solid returns this year. As of October 23, 2024, a major airline ETF issued by U.S. Global Investors has grown by 18.44% YTD, outperforming the broader market by 4.5%. Analysts at Forbes believe airline stocks are poised for strong growth during the second half of 2024 as fuel prices dip after long periods of price hikes. Fuel accounts for between 20-30% of airlines’ total costs. Moreover, airlines in the US are cutting down on excess domestic capacity after compressed margins during the summer season. The oversupply of seats has resulted in lower fares, and airline operators are determined to correct that. The deceleration of capacity, coupled with strong travel demand, will enhance their pricing power and improve earnings. Hedge fund sentiment on airline stocks is also encouraging. Tony Bancroft from Gabelli Funds shared his insights on commercial aviation at the Morningstar Investment Conference in Chicago on June 26. He noted a significant growth in aircraft orders, resulting in major aircraft manufacturers having a 12-year backlog of orders. Bancroft cited China as the primary catalyst driving robust demand. According to the portfolio manager, the country represented 20% of all new aircraft orders as Chinese airlines strive to cater to the growing demand for travel among the middle class at home and in neighboring India. Bancroft also highlighted the rising middle class in the United States and other parts of the world that are increasing international travel, and contributing to the strength of the commercial aviation industry. We sampled stocks from ETFs with airline exposure and then picked the top 10 companies with the highest number of hedge funds having stakes in them. We ranked them in ascending order of hedge fund holders in each company. Data on hedge funds was sourced from Insider Monkey’s database of 912 hedge funds for the second quarter of 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A Boeing 737-Next Generation aircraft in flight, highlighting the efficiency of the company's fleet. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 24 Copa Holdings, S.A. (NYSE:CPA) is a publicly traded airline passenger and cargo service company. It owns two airlines: Copa Airlines, which provides international air transportation through its hub in Panama City, and Copa Airlines Colombia, which operates domestic and international flights from various cities in Colombia. According to Insider Monkey’s database for Q2 2024, 24 hedge funds held stakes in the company, making it one of the best airline stocks to buy according to hedge funds. Renaissance Technologies is the biggest investor in the company, among those tracked by Insider Monkey, with its holding valued at $82.99 million as of June 30, 2024. The company reported robust results during the second quarter of 2024, earning a net profit of $120.3 million, with EPS logged at $2.88. Its operating margin stood at 19.5%, making it the second-best quarter in the airline’s history. The strong performance was driven by a 10.6% increase in passenger traffic from the same period last year. Capacity increased by 9.7% during the quarter, resulting in a 0.7% increase in load factor, which now stands at 86.8%. Another metric that paints a promising picture of the company is the 5.8% year-over-year decline in cost per average seat mile, driven by lower sales and distribution charges and reduced aircraft maintenance costs. Low sales and distribution costs were attributed to most passengers directly booking their flights from Copa Holdings, S.A. (NYSE:CPA), instead of third-party channels. Customers also increasingly utilize the low-cost NDC travel agency channel. Looking ahead, the airline is aiming to ramp up its capacity between September and December to reach full capacity by the end of the year. It has also reaffirmed its operating margin for the full year 2024 to be in the range of 21% to 23%. This has led to a bullish sentiment around the stock. Wall Street analysts have consensus on the stock’s Strong Buy rating and anticipate a near 49% upside potential, on average, in its share price. The company does face a challenge emanating from the suspension of flight operations to Venezuela which is likely to affect its capacity and unit revenue guidance. However, the overall outlook for the company remains positive. Overall CPA ranks 6th on our list of the best airline stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of CPA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CPA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

The IATA anticipates global airline revenue to reach $996 billion in 2024, 19% higher than in 2019 and 1.5 times higher than the pandemic low of 2020. The global travel recovery has been led by the Middle East, the strongest tourism market in 2023, as it welcomed 22% more travelers than it did in 2019, becoming the only region to prevail over pandemic levels. Europe reached 94% of the levels in 2019, while Africa stood at 96%. Asia Pacific has been rather slow, recovering only 65% of pre-pandemic levels as of last year. The uptick in international travel is yielding solid returns this year. As of October 23, 2024, a major airline ETF issued by U.S. Global Investors has grown by 18.44% YTD, outperforming the broader market by 4.5%. Analysts at Forbes believe airline stocks are poised for strong growth during the second half of 2024 as fuel prices dip after long periods of price hikes. Fuel accounts for between 20-30% of airlines’ total costs. Moreover, airlines in the US are cutting down on excess domestic capacity after compressed margins during the summer season. The oversupply of seats has resulted in lower fares, and airline operators are determined to correct that. The deceleration of capacity, coupled with strong travel demand, will enhance their pricing power and improve earnings. Hedge fund sentiment on airline stocks is also encouraging. Tony Bancroft from Gabelli Funds shared his insights on commercial aviation at the Morningstar Investment Conference in Chicago on June 26. He noted a significant growth in aircraft orders, resulting in major aircraft manufacturers having a 12-year backlog of orders. Bancroft cited China as the primary catalyst driving robust demand. According to the portfolio manager, the country represented 20% of all new aircraft orders as Chinese airlines strive to cater to the growing demand for travel among the middle class at home and in neighboring India. Bancroft also highlighted the rising middle class in the United States and other parts of the world that are increasing international travel, and contributing to the strength of the commercial aviation industry. We sampled stocks from ETFs with airline exposure and then picked the top 10 companies with the highest number of hedge funds having stakes in them. We ranked them in ascending order of hedge fund holders in each company. Data on hedge funds was sourced from Insider Monkey’s database of 912 hedge funds for the second quarter of 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A commercial Boeing 737 aircraft flying in the sky with the well-known SWABIZ logo on it. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 23 Southwest Airlines Co. (NYSE:LUV) is a major airline based in the United States, that offers flights from 117 airports across 11 countries. The low-cost carrier operates on a point-to-point model enabling direct flights between destinations, and eliminating the time and distance taken when traveling with airlines that require passengers to travel through a conventional hub. During the second quarter of 2024, Southwest Airlines generated a revenue of $7.35 billion, beating expectations of $7.32 billion, and up 4.5% from last year. Net income for Q2 stood at $367 million, resulting in an EPS of 58 cents, which beat estimates, but was down 46% year-over-year. The company’s earnings continue to be burdened, partly driven by plane delivery delays from Boeing, which has depressed revenues and increased pressures on costs. The airline has also been greatly affected by dampened airfares amid overcapacity in the domestic market. According to a September report in the Associated Press, the company’s shares have lost around half of their value over the past three years due to these factors, which has led to increased investor pressure to improve performance. Elliott Investment Management, a hedge fund, has launched a campaign to call a special meeting of shareholders to dump CEO Bob Jordan and replace two-thirds of the board of directors for underperformance. The airline has recently announced plans to end its open-seating policy and begin offering premium seating, in a bid to elevate customer experience and drive shareholder value. Southwest Airlines expects revenue from its new seat model and extra legspace to be north of what it generates from its ancillary offerings. The company will also be starting red-eye flights in early 2025. Southwest has also been improving its operational systems, which helped the company stay largely unaffected by the global tech outage in July. While hedge fund sentiment towards the company has dipped significantly – from 33 hedge funds having investments in the stock in Q1 to just 23 in Q2 – because of the ongoing headwinds, Southwest Airlines Co. (NYSE:LUV) continues to be one of the best airline stocks to buy according to hedge funds. Overall LUV ranks 7th on our list of the best airline stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of LUV as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Title: Will Microsoft Shareholders Vote ‘Yes’ On Bitcoin? What To Expect
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/microsoft-shareholders-vote-bitcoin-what-to-expect/
Time Published: 2024-10-26T01:00:47Z

In a recent SEC filing dated Thursday, October 24, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) revealed that an “Assessment of Investing in Bitcoin” will be a voting item at its forthcoming shareholder meeting on December 10. This development has ignited discussions within the investment community about the potential direction of Microsoft’s treasury strategy and the likelihood of shareholder approval. Microsoft’s board of directors has formally recommended voting against the Bitcoin investment proposal. In supplementary materials filed with the SEC on October 25, the board articulated that the requested assessment is redundant, emphasizing that Microsoft’s management already integrates considerations of cryptocurrencies into their broader investment strategy. The board highlights that “This proposal requests that the Board conduct an assessment that is unnecessary because Microsoft’s management already carefully considers this topic. Microsoft’s Global Treasury and Investment Services team evaluates a wide range of investable assets to fund Microsoft’s ongoing operations, including assets expected to provide diversification and inflation protection.” The filing further noted that past evaluations have included Bitcoin among other cryptocurrencies. “Past evaluations have included Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies among the options considered, and Microsoft continues to monitor trends and developments related to cryptocurrencies to inform future decision making,” the filing adds. The board asserted confidence in Microsoft’s existing processes to manage and diversify its corporate treasury for the long-term benefit of shareholders, deeming the public assessment unnecessary. “Microsoft has strong and appropriate processes in place to manage and diversify its corporate treasury for the long-term benefit of shareholders and this requested public assessment is unwarranted.” Microsoft’s shareholder base is a diverse mix of institutional investors, public companies, and individual investors. As of June 30, 2024, institutional investors held approximately 43.13% of Microsoft’s outstanding shares, while public companies and individual investors accounted for 56.84%. Insiders held a negligible 0.04% of the shares. The Vanguard Group stands as Microsoft’s largest shareholder, owning around 9.09% of the total shares outstanding. BlackRock follows with a 7.45% stake, making it the second-largest shareholder. State Street holds the third-largest position with a 4.04% ownership. Given this distribution, these major shareholders could be pivotal in determining the outcome of the proposal. Vanguard’s anti-BTC stance suggests a likely “no” vote, aligning with the board’s recommendation. Conversely, BlackRock has become a strong proponent of Bitcoin and offers its US clients a spot Bitcoin ETF since January this year. In their latest earning call, CEO Larry Fink said, “We believe Bitcoin is an asset class in itself.” He added, “It is an alternative to other commodities like gold.” State Street seems somewhat open-minded to Bitcoin. In mid-September, State Street launched in collaboration Galaxy 3 new crypto ETFs. In August, State Street partnered with Taurus to enhance its crypto services, facilitating the transformation of real-world assets into tradable digital assets. Nonetheless, industry analysts largely predict that the proposal to invest in Bitcoin will not gain sufficient support among Microsoft shareholders. Matthew Sigel, Head of Digital Assets Research at VanEck, summarized the situation on X: “Microsoft Shareholders to Vote on Proposal to Invest in Bitcoin. MSFT Board Advises ‘Nay’. No-Coiner Vanguard owns ~9%.” Similarly, Nate Geraci, President of The ETF Store and Co-Founder of the ETF Institute, expressed his expectations: “Gonna go out on a limb & predict Microsoft’s largest shareholder (Vanguard) will be voting ‘no’ on adding btc to the balance sheet…” Di Lewis, CFO at BTC Inc., also expressed strong skepticism about Microsoft’s likelihood to adopt Bitcoin, stating there is “0% chance Microsoft adds bitcoin to their balance sheet this decade.” Adam Cochran, a partner at CEHV, dismissed the proposal as a “fringe” idea from a think tank shareholder. He stated, “No. This is a fringe proposal by a think tank shareholder, and is not a serious consideration by Microsoft at large.” At press time, BTC traded at $67,608.

Title: Bitcoin Could Bring Microsoft ‘Next Trillion Dollars’ in Value, Michael Saylor Suggests
URL: https://www.cryptoglobe.com/latest/2024/10/bitcoin-could-bring-microsoft-next-trillion-dollars-in-value-michael-saylor-suggests/
Time Published: 2024-10-26T00:47:00Z
Full Content:
Michael Saylor, MicroStrategy’s co-founder and executive chairman, has told Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) CEO Satya Nadella that he could help the company make “the next trillion dollars for MSFT shareholders.” In a post on the microblogging platform X (formerly known as Twitter). Saylor tagged Nadella and added along an image with a recent proposal for Microsoft shareholders to weigh in on adding Bitcoin to the company’s balance sheet. While the proposal, put forth by the National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR), has garnered attention, Microsoft’s board of directors has recommended voting against it. The company’s board argues that it has already evaluated many investment opportunities, including Bitcoin. The NCPPR’s rationale for the proposal centers on the success of Nasdaq-listed business intelligence firm MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin investment strategy, which saw it outperform Microsoft by over 300% this year on the market even as it conducted a “fraction of the business” of the tech giant. Hey @SatyaNadella, if you want to make the next trillion dollars for $MSFT shareholders, call me. pic.twitter.com/NPnVvL7Wmj The proposal points out that Microsoft has $484 billion in total assets “the plurality of which are US government securities and corporate bonds that barely outpace inflation,” and argues that corporations have a “fiduciary duty” to consider “diversifying their balance sheets with assets that appreciate more than bonds, even if those assets are more volatile short-term.” It points out that Bitcoin’s price has been rising significantly and that MicroStrategy, the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, managed to see its shares outperform those of Microsoft this year by more than 300%, despite “doing only a fraction of the business that Microsoft has.” The NCPPR’s proposal also points out that Microsoft’s second-largest shareholder BlackRock – the world’s largest asset manager – offers its clients a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) that can be used to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency. Per the independent think tank, BTC’s volatility means companies “should not hold too much of it,” but given its track record as a hedge against inflation companies should “also not risk shareholder value by ignoring Bitcoin altogether” and recommends a minimum allocation of 1% of the company’s assets to Bitcoin.

Title: Small Business Owners are branded “terrorists” by Federal Government

Skip to comments. Posted on 10/25/2024 3:20:20 PM PDT by george76 In just over 2 months every small business owner in America is required to be registered with the Federal Government’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). The Biden/Harris administration rolled out this unconstitutional law, known as the Corporate Transparency Act (CTA), on January 1st, 2024. The CTA requires all small business owners in the United States, with revenue under 5 million and less than 20 full time employees to self-report to FinCEN, housed under the Department of Treasury. According FinCEN’s website: “FinCEN is a bureau of the U.S. Department of the Treasury. The Director of FinCEN is appointed by the Secretary of the Treasury and reports to the Treasury Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence. “ Your failure to report into this terrorism and intelligence database by January 1st, 2025 means that you will be subjected to fines of $591 per day and you could face a penalty of up to 2 years in federal prison. Small business owners in the United States could be jailed for up to 2 years for committing no crime, other than failing to turn over their personal, protected data to Big Brother. Senator Tommy Tuberville (R-AL) and Senator Warren Davidson (R-OH) seem to be the only two elected officials moving seriously against this unconstitutionality. Both offices have introduced the aptly named “Big Brother Overreach” Bill, but it has fallen on deaf ears. With current elections being as close as they are in Ohio, perhaps Senator Sherrod Brown should be asked where he stands on this issue? It is shocking that this has not been a national campaign issue already and, unfortunately, millions of small business owners don’t even know this law exists. Nor do they know that they will automatically be in violation of this law on January 2nd. Talk about an “October Surprise.” Why has the legacy media, on both sides of the aisle, been silent on this? Why is this dangerous piece of legislation not being exposed for the tyranny that it is? President Trump vetoed the NDAA in 2019, effectively stopping the CTA, but it resurfaced and was passed with a veto proof majority in 2021, which makes it even more urgent to get this issue in the public eye. What is FinCEN? Enforcement of the CTA falls under The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN); a bureau within the Department of Treasury. FinCEN’s mission statement reads: “FinCEN’s mission is to safeguard the financial system from illicit activity, counter money laundering and the financing of terrorism, and promote national security through strategic use of financial authorities and the collection, analysis, and dissemination of financial intelligence” The first question that we need to be asking is why are innocent small business owners being asked to provide all of their personal information to a federal database that reports directly to the Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence? Does the federal government classify all small business owners in the United States as “terrorists”? Secondly, the Department of Treasury is not known for its track record of impartiality. Non-profit organizations have previously been targeted by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), also housed under the same Department of Treasury. In 2013, the IRS, under Lois Lerner’s leadership targeted conservative non-profit groups with the name “tea party”, “patriot”, etc., and in a brazen act of political warfare, denied and/or revoked their non-profit status. The Corporate Transparency Act is nothing more than the “for profit” equivalent of the same non-profit Department of Treasury scandal of years back. Where is the guarantee that this database, housed under the Department of Treasury, will not be weaponized? FinCEN is creating a massive federal database of every single small business owner in the United States, with the potential of jail time for failure to self-report and massive fines. However, if your revenue is over 5 million, and you have 20 or more full time employees, you are exempt from this intrusive law and regulatory nightmare. This law does not apply to Blackrock, Pfizer, Apple, Google, Amazon, Facebook, etc. This law has been set up, exclusively, to target small business owners. Even more concerning is the fact that the National Department of Treasury Union has openly and unapologetically endorsed Kamala Harris for President. Partisan enforcement of CTA, by an unelected bureaucracy, against political enemies is not a question of “if”, but “when”. One especially alarming part of FinCEN’s mission statement reads: “…….security through strategic use of financial authorities and the collection, analysis, and dissemination of financial intelligence” “Dissemination” to who? Who does FinCEN share this data with? A World Wide Web of data sharing FinCEN is a member of the Egmont Group, and it serves as the United States’ Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) for the Egmont Group, as part of a wider network of 177 international FIU’s. In the UK the equivalent is the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) or the National Crimes Agency (NCA), who are also member FIU’s of the Egmont Group. The equivalent office to FinCEN in Canada would be the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC), also focused on Terrorism finance, and if you are “down under” in Australia it would be the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC). Why is this important and concerning? Well, because under data sharing and cooperative agreements that FinCEN and the Egmont Group are a party to, this means that your information, to include your residential address, could be shared and made available around the world with the push of a button or a database query, and you would never know. Who are the Egmont Group? The Egmont Group, of which FinCEN is a member FIU, was founded in Brussels in 1995 as an international network to facilitate information sharing and dissemination to counter anti-money laundering and counterterrorism financing. It has been headquartered in Canada since 2008. According to its website: “As a global organization, the Egmont Group both facilitates and prompts the exchange of information, knowledge and cooperation amongst member FIUs.” The fact that information is shared, not only with allied “five eye” nations, but much wider through the Egmont Group’s FIU network, is of immediate concern. The Council for Financial Activities Control in Brazil, another member FIU, could conceivably have access to this shared information. Remember that Brazil is controlled by the far left socialist leadership under Lula da Silva. Do you want your information being shared with comrade Lula? Let’s not forget that Lula’s government is currently targeting Elon Musk, who has the resources to fight this, but what about “mom and pop” small business owners across the United States, who don’t have the same financial resources? The French equivalent to FinCEN is TRACFIN. No sane person would want their personal financial information being shared with Emmanuel Macron or his government. What about Mexico? Do you really trust your information with the Unidad de Inteligencia Financiera? Or what about Russia’s FIU? Or Venezuela’s FIU? How about Palestine? You can find the full list of Egmont Group FIU member states, including FinCEN here: Earlier this year FINTRAC, the Canadian equivalent to FinCEN was hacked. Canadian authorities still have no idea how bad this data breach actually was. Your information could be shared among multiple databases and FIU’s, including FINTRAC, exposing your personal and sensitive financial data, with no guarantees of security or privacy. Putting international data sharing concerns aside, the Federal Government in the US doesn’t have a positive track record for protecting personal data, either. Perhaps the best example of this was the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) breach, in 2015, under the Obama administration. But don’t worry, I’m sure the sensitive personal and financial data of millions of innocent small business owners will be safe with FinCEN. Most concerning is that the Egmont Group is based in Canada. Every FIU, including FinCEN, sits under a separate entity under Canadian jurisdiction. Does anyone really trust Justin Trudeau’s Canada and his unelected bureaucracy any more than they trust the unelected bureaucracy in America? Here is a list of the Egmont groups’ affiliate organizations: Vice President Kamala Harris wants to tout her “Opportunity Agenda” and her support of small businesses, yet her administration, of which she is the sitting Vice President, is moving at lightning speed to regulate and criminalize millions of small business owners in the United States. This includes massive fines and up to 2 years in federal prison.. The CTA is a clear violation of the 4th amendment, the 5th amendment and the 10th amendment. State Attorney General’s need to weigh in, urgently. Entity creation and registration has always been a States’ right issue. This is the largest first step the United States has ever taken towards nationalizing private business ownership under a federal umbrella. So what if you decide you want to close your business and not be forced to hand over your personal data to this terrorism and intelligence database? According to FinCEN, enforcement is retroactive. As long as you operated a small business for even one day in 2024, you are still required to self-report, even though you no longer own that business or it has been dissolved. Again, your failure to do so could land you in prison. The Corporate Transparency Act is not about “transparency” or “compliance”, it is about “control”. Unfortunately, without more citizen engagement, and without this being a front and center campaign issue, it seems that little will be done to stop this massive government overreach. If the legacy media won’t cover this then the alternative media like The Gateway Pundit, and citizen journalists will.

A federal judge determined that the reporting was unconstitutional but his injunction ONLY applied to the parties to the case. The fines for this thing are extortionate.

Free Republic Browse · Search Bloggers & Personal Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson The CTA requires all small business owners in the United States, with revenue under 5 million and less than 20 full time employees to self-report to FinCEN, housed under the Department of Treasury. According FinCEN’s website: “FinCEN is a bureau of the U.S. Department of the Treasury. The Director of FinCEN is appointed by the Secretary of the Treasury and reports to the Treasury Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence. “ Your failure to report into this terrorism and intelligence database by January 1st, 2025 means that you will be subjected to fines of $591 per day and you could face a penalty of up to 2 years in federal prison. Small business owners in the United States could be jailed for up to 2 years for committing no crime, other than failing to turn over their personal, protected data to Big Brother. Senator Tommy Tuberville (R-AL) and Senator Warren Davidson (R-OH) seem to be the only two elected officials moving seriously against this unconstitutionality. Both offices have introduced the aptly named “Big Brother Overreach” Bill, but it has fallen on deaf ears. With current elections being as close as they are in Ohio, perhaps Senator Sherrod Brown should be asked where he stands on this issue? It is shocking that this has not been a national campaign issue already and, unfortunately, millions of small business owners don’t even know this law exists. Nor do they know that they will automatically be in violation of this law on January 2nd. Talk about an “October Surprise.” Why has the legacy media, on both sides of the aisle, been silent on this? Why is this dangerous piece of legislation not being exposed for the tyranny that it is? President Trump vetoed the NDAA in 2019, effectively stopping the CTA, but it resurfaced and was passed with a veto proof majority in 2021, which makes it even more urgent to get this issue in the public eye. What is FinCEN? Enforcement of the CTA falls under The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN); a bureau within the Department of Treasury. FinCEN’s mission statement reads: “FinCEN’s mission is to safeguard the financial system from illicit activity, counter money laundering and the financing of terrorism, and promote national security through strategic use of financial authorities and the collection, analysis, and dissemination of financial intelligence” The first question that we need to be asking is why are innocent small business owners being asked to provide all of their personal information to a federal database that reports directly to the Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence? Does the federal government classify all small business owners in the United States as “terrorists”? Secondly, the Department of Treasury is not known for its track record of impartiality. Non-profit organizations have previously been targeted by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), also housed under the same Department of Treasury. In 2013, the IRS, under Lois Lerner’s leadership targeted conservative non-profit groups with the name “tea party”, “patriot”, etc., and in a brazen act of political warfare, denied and/or revoked their non-profit status. The Corporate Transparency Act is nothing more than the “for profit” equivalent of the same non-profit Department of Treasury scandal of years back. Where is the guarantee that this database, housed under the Department of Treasury, will not be weaponized? FinCEN is creating a massive federal database of every single small business owner in the United States, with the potential of jail time for failure to self-report and massive fines. However, if your revenue is over 5 million, and you have 20 or more full time employees, you are exempt from this intrusive law and regulatory nightmare. This law does not apply to Blackrock, Pfizer, Apple, Google, Amazon, Facebook, etc. This law has been set up, exclusively, to target small business owners. Even more concerning is the fact that the National Department of Treasury Union has openly and unapologetically endorsed Kamala Harris for President. Partisan enforcement of CTA, by an unelected bureaucracy, against political enemies is not a question of “if”, but “when”. One especially alarming part of FinCEN’s mission statement reads: “…….security through strategic use of financial authorities and the collection, analysis, and dissemination of financial intelligence” “Dissemination” to who? Who does FinCEN share this data with? A World Wide Web of data sharing FinCEN is a member of the Egmont Group, and it serves as the United States’ Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) for the Egmont Group, as part of a wider network of 177 international FIU’s. In the UK the equivalent is the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) or the National Crimes Agency (NCA), who are also member FIU’s of the Egmont Group. The equivalent office to FinCEN in Canada would be the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC), also focused on Terrorism finance, and if you are “down under” in Australia it would be the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC). Why is this important and concerning? Well, because under data sharing and cooperative agreements that FinCEN and the Egmont Group are a party to, this means that your information, to include your residential address, could be shared and made available around the world with the push of a button or a database query, and you would never know. Who are the Egmont Group? The Egmont Group, of which FinCEN is a member FIU, was founded in Brussels in 1995 as an international network to facilitate information sharing and dissemination to counter anti-money laundering and counterterrorism financing. It has been headquartered in Canada since 2008. According to its website: “As a global organization, the Egmont Group both facilitates and prompts the exchange of information, knowledge and cooperation amongst member FIUs.” The fact that information is shared, not only with allied “five eye” nations, but much wider through the Egmont Group’s FIU network, is of immediate concern. The Council for Financial Activities Control in Brazil, another member FIU, could conceivably have access to this shared information. Remember that Brazil is controlled by the far left socialist leadership under Lula da Silva. Do you want your information being shared with comrade Lula? Let’s not forget that Lula’s government is currently targeting Elon Musk, who has the resources to fight this, but what about “mom and pop” small business owners across the United States, who don’t have the same financial resources? The French equivalent to FinCEN is TRACFIN. No sane person would want their personal financial information being shared with Emmanuel Macron or his government. What about Mexico? Do you really trust your information with the Unidad de Inteligencia Financiera? Or what about Russia’s FIU? Or Venezuela’s FIU? How about Palestine? You can find the full list of Egmont Group FIU member states, including FinCEN here: Earlier this year FINTRAC, the Canadian equivalent to FinCEN was hacked. Canadian authorities still have no idea how bad this data breach actually was. Your information could be shared among multiple databases and FIU’s, including FINTRAC, exposing your personal and sensitive financial data, with no guarantees of security or privacy. Putting international data sharing concerns aside, the Federal Government in the US doesn’t have a positive track record for protecting personal data, either. Perhaps the best example of this was the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) breach, in 2015, under the Obama administration. But don’t worry, I’m sure the sensitive personal and financial data of millions of innocent small business owners will be safe with FinCEN. Most concerning is that the Egmont Group is based in Canada. Every FIU, including FinCEN, sits under a separate entity under Canadian jurisdiction. Does anyone really trust Justin Trudeau’s Canada and his unelected bureaucracy any more than they trust the unelected bureaucracy in America? Here is a list of the Egmont groups’ affiliate organizations: Vice President Kamala Harris wants to tout her “Opportunity Agenda” and her support of small businesses, yet her administration, of which she is the sitting Vice President, is moving at lightning speed to regulate and criminalize millions of small business owners in the United States. This includes massive fines and up to 2 years in federal prison.. The CTA is a clear violation of the 4th amendment, the 5th amendment and the 10th amendment. State Attorney General’s need to weigh in, urgently. Entity creation and registration has always been a States’ right issue. This is the largest first step the United States has ever taken towards nationalizing private business ownership under a federal umbrella. So what if you decide you want to close your business and not be forced to hand over your personal data to this terrorism and intelligence database? According to FinCEN, enforcement is retroactive. As long as you operated a small business for even one day in 2024, you are still required to self-report, even though you no longer own that business or it has been dissolved. Again, your failure to do so could land you in prison. The Corporate Transparency Act is not about “transparency” or “compliance”, it is about “control”. Unfortunately, without more citizen engagement, and without this being a front and center campaign issue, it seems that little will be done to stop this massive government overreach. If the legacy media won’t cover this then the alternative media like The Gateway Pundit, and citizen journalists will.

Trump vetoed the original bill but congress overrode the veto which means that REPUBLICANS supported this crap in sufficient numbers to get it through. A federal judge determined that the reporting was unconstitutional but his injunction ONLY applied to the parties to the case. The fines for this thing are extortionate. If you set up an LLC for a rental property 30 years ago and never closed it then you’re on the hook for this filing. If you had a business in an LLC or Corporation and sold the business but never closed the entity then you’re on the hook for this filing. If you were on an LLC filing for an ex-spouse that never closed the entity you’re on the hook for this even if you separated a decade ago.

This reporting requirement is one of the most egregious abuses of government power I have ever witnessed and it’s a direct violation of the 4th Amendment. Trump vetoed the original bill but congress overrode the veto which means that REPUBLICANS supported this crap in sufficient numbers to get it through. A federal judge determined that the reporting was unconstitutional but his injunction ONLY applied to the parties to the case. The fines for this thing are extortionate. If you set up an LLC for a rental property 30 years ago and never closed it then you’re on the hook for this filing. If you had a business in an LLC or Corporation and sold the business but never closed the entity then you’re on the hook for this filing. If you were on an LLC filing for an ex-spouse that never closed the entity you’re on the hook for this even if you separated a decade ago. It’s insanity. 4 posted on 10/25/2024 3:33:21 PM PDT by Tucsonican [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: I want the USA back; george76 --- "Our government is even more fascist than I thought."

Small businesses are owned and managed by "the people."This is why they hate Trump. He is not part of the system. Though he is wealthy, he is independent and the Deep State couldn't control him. And he is a populist--the people's man--and the Deep State/Democrats/Elites hate the people.This is at the heart of this revolution. The Deep State--the government--believes it should be in charge. They don't believe the people are smart enough to have a say in the way the country is run. And the Democrats support the government.Eisenhower almost got it right...but he forgot about the permanent government when he warned us about the military/industrial complex.This is a revolution to destroy our representative government. And that will take the destruction of the Constitution.This is why the Democrats and the Deep State believe Trump and MAGA are an existential threat to their power.And they are right.If our country is to survive, Trump must win and the Democrats and the Deep State must be destroyed.There cannot be a compromise because our enemy will not accept a compromise.This is what Trump means when he speaks of our enemy within.

Free Republic Browse · Search Bloggers & Personal Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson “FinCEN is a bureau of the U.S. Department of the Treasury. The Director of FinCEN is appointed by the Secretary of the Treasury and reports to the Treasury Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence. “ Your failure to report into this terrorism and intelligence database by January 1st, 2025 means that you will be subjected to fines of $591 per day and you could face a penalty of up to 2 years in federal prison. Small business owners in the United States could be jailed for up to 2 years for committing no crime, other than failing to turn over their personal, protected data to Big Brother. Senator Tommy Tuberville (R-AL) and Senator Warren Davidson (R-OH) seem to be the only two elected officials moving seriously against this unconstitutionality. Both offices have introduced the aptly named “Big Brother Overreach” Bill, but it has fallen on deaf ears. With current elections being as close as they are in Ohio, perhaps Senator Sherrod Brown should be asked where he stands on this issue? It is shocking that this has not been a national campaign issue already and, unfortunately, millions of small business owners don’t even know this law exists. Nor do they know that they will automatically be in violation of this law on January 2nd. Talk about an “October Surprise.” Why has the legacy media, on both sides of the aisle, been silent on this? Why is this dangerous piece of legislation not being exposed for the tyranny that it is? President Trump vetoed the NDAA in 2019, effectively stopping the CTA, but it resurfaced and was passed with a veto proof majority in 2021, which makes it even more urgent to get this issue in the public eye. What is FinCEN? Enforcement of the CTA falls under The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN); a bureau within the Department of Treasury. FinCEN’s mission statement reads: “FinCEN’s mission is to safeguard the financial system from illicit activity, counter money laundering and the financing of terrorism, and promote national security through strategic use of financial authorities and the collection, analysis, and dissemination of financial intelligence” The first question that we need to be asking is why are innocent small business owners being asked to provide all of their personal information to a federal database that reports directly to the Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence? Does the federal government classify all small business owners in the United States as “terrorists”? Secondly, the Department of Treasury is not known for its track record of impartiality. Non-profit organizations have previously been targeted by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), also housed under the same Department of Treasury. In 2013, the IRS, under Lois Lerner’s leadership targeted conservative non-profit groups with the name “tea party”, “patriot”, etc., and in a brazen act of political warfare, denied and/or revoked their non-profit status. The Corporate Transparency Act is nothing more than the “for profit” equivalent of the same non-profit Department of Treasury scandal of years back. Where is the guarantee that this database, housed under the Department of Treasury, will not be weaponized? FinCEN is creating a massive federal database of every single small business owner in the United States, with the potential of jail time for failure to self-report and massive fines. However, if your revenue is over 5 million, and you have 20 or more full time employees, you are exempt from this intrusive law and regulatory nightmare. This law does not apply to Blackrock, Pfizer, Apple, Google, Amazon, Facebook, etc. This law has been set up, exclusively, to target small business owners. Even more concerning is the fact that the National Department of Treasury Union has openly and unapologetically endorsed Kamala Harris for President. Partisan enforcement of CTA, by an unelected bureaucracy, against political enemies is not a question of “if”, but “when”. One especially alarming part of FinCEN’s mission statement reads: “…….security through strategic use of financial authorities and the collection, analysis, and dissemination of financial intelligence” “Dissemination” to who? Who does FinCEN share this data with? A World Wide Web of data sharing FinCEN is a member of the Egmont Group, and it serves as the United States’ Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) for the Egmont Group, as part of a wider network of 177 international FIU’s. In the UK the equivalent is the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) or the National Crimes Agency (NCA), who are also member FIU’s of the Egmont Group. The equivalent office to FinCEN in Canada would be the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC), also focused on Terrorism finance, and if you are “down under” in Australia it would be the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC). Why is this important and concerning? Well, because under data sharing and cooperative agreements that FinCEN and the Egmont Group are a party to, this means that your information, to include your residential address, could be shared and made available around the world with the push of a button or a database query, and you would never know. Who are the Egmont Group? The Egmont Group, of which FinCEN is a member FIU, was founded in Brussels in 1995 as an international network to facilitate information sharing and dissemination to counter anti-money laundering and counterterrorism financing. It has been headquartered in Canada since 2008. According to its website: “As a global organization, the Egmont Group both facilitates and prompts the exchange of information, knowledge and cooperation amongst member FIUs.” The fact that information is shared, not only with allied “five eye” nations, but much wider through the Egmont Group’s FIU network, is of immediate concern. The Council for Financial Activities Control in Brazil, another member FIU, could conceivably have access to this shared information. Remember that Brazil is controlled by the far left socialist leadership under Lula da Silva. Do you want your information being shared with comrade Lula? Let’s not forget that Lula’s government is currently targeting Elon Musk, who has the resources to fight this, but what about “mom and pop” small business owners across the United States, who don’t have the same financial resources? The French equivalent to FinCEN is TRACFIN. No sane person would want their personal financial information being shared with Emmanuel Macron or his government. What about Mexico? Do you really trust your information with the Unidad de Inteligencia Financiera? Or what about Russia’s FIU? Or Venezuela’s FIU? How about Palestine? You can find the full list of Egmont Group FIU member states, including FinCEN here: Earlier this year FINTRAC, the Canadian equivalent to FinCEN was hacked. Canadian authorities still have no idea how bad this data breach actually was. Your information could be shared among multiple databases and FIU’s, including FINTRAC, exposing your personal and sensitive financial data, with no guarantees of security or privacy. Putting international data sharing concerns aside, the Federal Government in the US doesn’t have a positive track record for protecting personal data, either. Perhaps the best example of this was the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) breach, in 2015, under the Obama administration. But don’t worry, I’m sure the sensitive personal and financial data of millions of innocent small business owners will be safe with FinCEN. Most concerning is that the Egmont Group is based in Canada. Every FIU, including FinCEN, sits under a separate entity under Canadian jurisdiction. Does anyone really trust Justin Trudeau’s Canada and his unelected bureaucracy any more than they trust the unelected bureaucracy in America? Here is a list of the Egmont groups’ affiliate organizations: Vice President Kamala Harris wants to tout her “Opportunity Agenda” and her support of small businesses, yet her administration, of which she is the sitting Vice President, is moving at lightning speed to regulate and criminalize millions of small business owners in the United States. This includes massive fines and up to 2 years in federal prison.. The CTA is a clear violation of the 4th amendment, the 5th amendment and the 10th amendment. State Attorney General’s need to weigh in, urgently. Entity creation and registration has always been a States’ right issue. This is the largest first step the United States has ever taken towards nationalizing private business ownership under a federal umbrella. So what if you decide you want to close your business and not be forced to hand over your personal data to this terrorism and intelligence database? According to FinCEN, enforcement is retroactive. As long as you operated a small business for even one day in 2024, you are still required to self-report, even though you no longer own that business or it has been dissolved. Again, your failure to do so could land you in prison. The Corporate Transparency Act is not about “transparency” or “compliance”, it is about “control”. Unfortunately, without more citizen engagement, and without this being a front and center campaign issue, it seems that little will be done to stop this massive government overreach. If the legacy media won’t cover this then the alternative media like The Gateway Pundit, and citizen journalists will.

A World Wide Web of data sharing FinCEN is a member of the Egmont Group, and it serves as the United States’ Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) for the Egmont Group, as part of a wider network of 177 international FIU’s. In the UK the equivalent is the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) or the National Crimes Agency (NCA), who are also member FIU’s of the Egmont Group. The equivalent office to FinCEN in Canada would be the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC), also focused on Terrorism finance, and if you are “down under” in Australia it would be the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC). Why is this important and concerning? Well, because under data sharing and cooperative agreements that FinCEN and the Egmont Group are a party to, this means that your information, to include your residential address, could be shared and made available around the world with the push of a button or a database query, and you would never know. Who are the Egmont Group? The Egmont Group, of which FinCEN is a member FIU, was founded in Brussels in 1995 as an international network to facilitate information sharing and dissemination to counter anti-money laundering and counterterrorism financing. It has been headquartered in Canada since 2008. According to its website: “As a global organization, the Egmont Group both facilitates and prompts the exchange of information, knowledge and cooperation amongst member FIUs.” The fact that information is shared, not only with allied “five eye” nations, but much wider through the Egmont Group’s FIU network, is of immediate concern. The Council for Financial Activities Control in Brazil, another member FIU, could conceivably have access to this shared information. Remember that Brazil is controlled by the far left socialist leadership under Lula da Silva. Do you want your information being shared with comrade Lula? Let’s not forget that Lula’s government is currently targeting Elon Musk, who has the resources to fight this, but what about “mom and pop” small business owners across the United States, who don’t have the same financial resources? The French equivalent to FinCEN is TRACFIN. No sane person would want their personal financial information being shared with Emmanuel Macron or his government. What about Mexico? Do you really trust your information with the Unidad de Inteligencia Financiera? Or what about Russia’s FIU? Or Venezuela’s FIU? How about Palestine? You can find the full list of Egmont Group FIU member states, including FinCEN here: Earlier this year FINTRAC, the Canadian equivalent to FinCEN was hacked. Canadian authorities still have no idea how bad this data breach actually was. Your information could be shared among multiple databases and FIU’s, including FINTRAC, exposing your personal and sensitive financial data, with no guarantees of security or privacy. Putting international data sharing concerns aside, the Federal Government in the US doesn’t have a positive track record for protecting personal data, either. Perhaps the best example of this was the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) breach, in 2015, under the Obama administration. But don’t worry, I’m sure the sensitive personal and financial data of millions of innocent small business owners will be safe with FinCEN. Most concerning is that the Egmont Group is based in Canada. Every FIU, including FinCEN, sits under a separate entity under Canadian jurisdiction. Does anyone really trust Justin Trudeau’s Canada and his unelected bureaucracy any more than they trust the unelected bureaucracy in America? Here is a list of the Egmont groups’ affiliate organizations: Vice President Kamala Harris wants to tout her “Opportunity Agenda” and her support of small businesses, yet her administration, of which she is the sitting Vice President, is moving at lightning speed to regulate and criminalize millions of small business owners in the United States. This includes massive fines and up to 2 years in federal prison.. The CTA is a clear violation of the 4th amendment, the 5th amendment and the 10th amendment. State Attorney General’s need to weigh in, urgently. Entity creation and registration has always been a States’ right issue. This is the largest first step the United States has ever taken towards nationalizing private business ownership under a federal umbrella. So what if you decide you want to close your business and not be forced to hand over your personal data to this terrorism and intelligence database? According to FinCEN, enforcement is retroactive. As long as you operated a small business for even one day in 2024, you are still required to self-report, even though you no longer own that business or it has been dissolved. Again, your failure to do so could land you in prison. The Corporate Transparency Act is not about “transparency” or “compliance”, it is about “control”. Unfortunately, without more citizen engagement, and without this being a front and center campaign issue, it seems that little will be done to stop this massive government overreach. If the legacy media won’t cover this then the alternative media like The Gateway Pundit, and citizen journalists will.

Both offices have introduced the aptly named “Big Brother Overreach” Bill, but it has fallen on deaf ears. With current elections being as close as they are in Ohio, perhaps Senator Sherrod Brown should be asked where he stands on this issue? It is shocking that this has not been a national campaign issue already and, unfortunately, millions of small business owners don’t even know this law exists. Nor do they know that they will automatically be in violation of this law on January 2nd. Talk about an “October Surprise.” Why has the legacy media, on both sides of the aisle, been silent on this? Why is this dangerous piece of legislation not being exposed for the tyranny that it is? President Trump vetoed the NDAA in 2019, effectively stopping the CTA, but it resurfaced and was passed with a veto proof majority in 2021, which makes it even more urgent to get this issue in the public eye. What is FinCEN? Enforcement of the CTA falls under The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN); a bureau within the Department of Treasury. FinCEN’s mission statement reads: “FinCEN’s mission is to safeguard the financial system from illicit activity, counter money laundering and the financing of terrorism, and promote national security through strategic use of financial authorities and the collection, analysis, and dissemination of financial intelligence” The first question that we need to be asking is why are innocent small business owners being asked to provide all of their personal information to a federal database that reports directly to the Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence? Does the federal government classify all small business owners in the United States as “terrorists”? Secondly, the Department of Treasury is not known for its track record of impartiality. Non-profit organizations have previously been targeted by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), also housed under the same Department of Treasury. In 2013, the IRS, under Lois Lerner’s leadership targeted conservative non-profit groups with the name “tea party”, “patriot”, etc., and in a brazen act of political warfare, denied and/or revoked their non-profit status. The Corporate Transparency Act is nothing more than the “for profit” equivalent of the same non-profit Department of Treasury scandal of years back. Where is the guarantee that this database, housed under the Department of Treasury, will not be weaponized? FinCEN is creating a massive federal database of every single small business owner in the United States, with the potential of jail time for failure to self-report and massive fines. However, if your revenue is over 5 million, and you have 20 or more full time employees, you are exempt from this intrusive law and regulatory nightmare. This law does not apply to Blackrock, Pfizer, Apple, Google, Amazon, Facebook, etc. This law has been set up, exclusively, to target small business owners. Even more concerning is the fact that the National Department of Treasury Union has openly and unapologetically endorsed Kamala Harris for President. Partisan enforcement of CTA, by an unelected bureaucracy, against political enemies is not a question of “if”, but “when”. One especially alarming part of FinCEN’s mission statement reads: “…….security through strategic use of financial authorities and the collection, analysis, and dissemination of financial intelligence” “Dissemination” to who? Who does FinCEN share this data with? A World Wide Web of data sharing FinCEN is a member of the Egmont Group, and it serves as the United States’ Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) for the Egmont Group, as part of a wider network of 177 international FIU’s.

The equivalent office to FinCEN in Canada would be the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC), also focused on Terrorism finance, and if you are “down under” in Australia it would be the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC). Why is this important and concerning?

Free Republic Browse · Search Bloggers & Personal Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson With current elections being as close as they are in Ohio, perhaps Senator Sherrod Brown should be asked where he stands on this issue? It is shocking that this has not been a national campaign issue already and, unfortunately, millions of small business owners don’t even know this law exists. Nor do they know that they will automatically be in violation of this law on January 2nd. Talk about an “October Surprise.” Why has the legacy media, on both sides of the aisle, been silent on this? Why is this dangerous piece of legislation not being exposed for the tyranny that it is? President Trump vetoed the NDAA in 2019, effectively stopping the CTA, but it resurfaced and was passed with a veto proof majority in 2021, which makes it even more urgent to get this issue in the public eye. What is FinCEN? Enforcement of the CTA falls under The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN); a bureau within the Department of Treasury. FinCEN’s mission statement reads: “FinCEN’s mission is to safeguard the financial system from illicit activity, counter money laundering and the financing of terrorism, and promote national security through strategic use of financial authorities and the collection, analysis, and dissemination of financial intelligence” The first question that we need to be asking is why are innocent small business owners being asked to provide all of their personal information to a federal database that reports directly to the Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence? Does the federal government classify all small business owners in the United States as “terrorists”? Secondly, the Department of Treasury is not known for its track record of impartiality. Non-profit organizations have previously been targeted by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), also housed under the same Department of Treasury. In 2013, the IRS, under Lois Lerner’s leadership targeted conservative non-profit groups with the name “tea party”, “patriot”, etc., and in a brazen act of political warfare, denied and/or revoked their non-profit status. The Corporate Transparency Act is nothing more than the “for profit” equivalent of the same non-profit Department of Treasury scandal of years back. Where is the guarantee that this database, housed under the Department of Treasury, will not be weaponized? FinCEN is creating a massive federal database of every single small business owner in the United States, with the potential of jail time for failure to self-report and massive fines. However, if your revenue is over 5 million, and you have 20 or more full time employees, you are exempt from this intrusive law and regulatory nightmare. This law does not apply to Blackrock, Pfizer, Apple, Google, Amazon, Facebook, etc. This law has been set up, exclusively, to target small business owners. Even more concerning is the fact that the National Department of Treasury Union has openly and unapologetically endorsed Kamala Harris for President. Partisan enforcement of CTA, by an unelected bureaucracy, against political enemies is not a question of “if”, but “when”. One especially alarming part of FinCEN’s mission statement reads: “…….security through strategic use of financial authorities and the collection, analysis, and dissemination of financial intelligence” “Dissemination” to who? Who does FinCEN share this data with? A World Wide Web of data sharing FinCEN is a member of the Egmont Group, and it serves as the United States’ Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) for the Egmont Group, as part of a wider network of 177 international FIU’s. In the UK the equivalent is the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) or the National Crimes Agency (NCA), who are also member FIU’s of the Egmont Group. The equivalent office to FinCEN in Canada would be the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC), also focused on Terrorism finance, and if you are “down under” in Australia it would be the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC). Why is this important and concerning? Well, because under data sharing and cooperative agreements that FinCEN and the Egmont Group are a party to, this means that your information, to include your residential address, could be shared and made available around the world with the push of a button or a database query, and you would never know. Who are the Egmont Group? The Egmont Group, of which FinCEN is a member FIU, was founded in Brussels in 1995 as an international network to facilitate information sharing and dissemination to counter anti-money laundering and counterterrorism financing. It has been headquartered in Canada since 2008. According to its website: “As a global organization, the Egmont Group both facilitates and prompts the exchange of information, knowledge and cooperation amongst member FIUs.” The fact that information is shared, not only with allied “five eye” nations, but much wider through the Egmont Group’s FIU network, is of immediate concern. The Council for Financial Activities Control in Brazil, another member FIU, could conceivably have access to this shared information. Remember that Brazil is controlled by the far left socialist leadership under Lula da Silva. Do you want your information being shared with comrade Lula? Let’s not forget that Lula’s government is currently targeting Elon Musk, who has the resources to fight this, but what about “mom and pop” small business owners across the United States, who don’t have the same financial resources? The French equivalent to FinCEN is TRACFIN. No sane person would want their personal financial information being shared with Emmanuel Macron or his government. What about Mexico? Do you really trust your information with the Unidad de Inteligencia Financiera? Or what about Russia’s FIU? Or Venezuela’s FIU? How about Palestine? You can find the full list of Egmont Group FIU member states, including FinCEN here: Earlier this year FINTRAC, the Canadian equivalent to FinCEN was hacked. Canadian authorities still have no idea how bad this data breach actually was. Your information could be shared among multiple databases and FIU’s, including FINTRAC, exposing your personal and sensitive financial data, with no guarantees of security or privacy. Putting international data sharing concerns aside, the Federal Government in the US doesn’t have a positive track record for protecting personal data, either. Perhaps the best example of this was the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) breach, in 2015, under the Obama administration. But don’t worry, I’m sure the sensitive personal and financial data of millions of innocent small business owners will be safe with FinCEN. Most concerning is that the Egmont Group is based in Canada. Every FIU, including FinCEN, sits under a separate entity under Canadian jurisdiction. Does anyone really trust Justin Trudeau’s Canada and his unelected bureaucracy any more than they trust the unelected bureaucracy in America? Here is a list of the Egmont groups’ affiliate organizations: Vice President Kamala Harris wants to tout her “Opportunity Agenda” and her support of small businesses, yet her administration, of which she is the sitting Vice President, is moving at lightning speed to regulate and criminalize millions of small business owners in the United States. This includes massive fines and up to 2 years in federal prison.. The CTA is a clear violation of the 4th amendment, the 5th amendment and the 10th amendment. State Attorney General’s need to weigh in, urgently. Entity creation and registration has always been a States’ right issue. This is the largest first step the United States has ever taken towards nationalizing private business ownership under a federal umbrella. So what if you decide you want to close your business and not be forced to hand over your personal data to this terrorism and intelligence database? According to FinCEN, enforcement is retroactive. As long as you operated a small business for even one day in 2024, you are still required to self-report, even though you no longer own that business or it has been dissolved. Again, your failure to do so could land you in prison. The Corporate Transparency Act is not about “transparency” or “compliance”, it is about “control”. Unfortunately, without more citizen engagement, and without this being a front and center campaign issue, it seems that little will be done to stop this massive government overreach. If the legacy media won’t cover this then the alternative media like The Gateway Pundit, and citizen journalists will.

Free Republic Browse · Search Bloggers & Personal Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Why has the legacy media, on both sides of the aisle, been silent on this? Why is this dangerous piece of legislation not being exposed for the tyranny that it is? President Trump vetoed the NDAA in 2019, effectively stopping the CTA, but it resurfaced and was passed with a veto proof majority in 2021, which makes it even more urgent to get this issue in the public eye. What is FinCEN? Enforcement of the CTA falls under The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN); a bureau within the Department of Treasury. FinCEN’s mission statement reads: “FinCEN’s mission is to safeguard the financial system from illicit activity, counter money laundering and the financing of terrorism, and promote national security through strategic use of financial authorities and the collection, analysis, and dissemination of financial intelligence” The first question that we need to be asking is why are innocent small business owners being asked to provide all of their personal information to a federal database that reports directly to the Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence? Does the federal government classify all small business owners in the United States as “terrorists”? Secondly, the Department of Treasury is not known for its track record of impartiality. Non-profit organizations have previously been targeted by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), also housed under the same Department of Treasury. In 2013, the IRS, under Lois Lerner’s leadership targeted conservative non-profit groups with the name “tea party”, “patriot”, etc., and in a brazen act of political warfare, denied and/or revoked their non-profit status. The Corporate Transparency Act is nothing more than the “for profit” equivalent of the same non-profit Department of Treasury scandal of years back. Where is the guarantee that this database, housed under the Department of Treasury, will not be weaponized? FinCEN is creating a massive federal database of every single small business owner in the United States, with the potential of jail time for failure to self-report and massive fines. However, if your revenue is over 5 million, and you have 20 or more full time employees, you are exempt from this intrusive law and regulatory nightmare. This law does not apply to Blackrock, Pfizer, Apple, Google, Amazon, Facebook, etc. This law has been set up, exclusively, to target small business owners. Even more concerning is the fact that the National Department of Treasury Union has openly and unapologetically endorsed Kamala Harris for President. Partisan enforcement of CTA, by an unelected bureaucracy, against political enemies is not a question of “if”, but “when”. One especially alarming part of FinCEN’s mission statement reads: “…….security through strategic use of financial authorities and the collection, analysis, and dissemination of financial intelligence” “Dissemination” to who? Who does FinCEN share this data with? A World Wide Web of data sharing FinCEN is a member of the Egmont Group, and it serves as the United States’ Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) for the Egmont Group, as part of a wider network of 177 international FIU’s. In the UK the equivalent is the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) or the National Crimes Agency (NCA), who are also member FIU’s of the Egmont Group. The equivalent office to FinCEN in Canada would be the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC), also focused on Terrorism finance, and if you are “down under” in Australia it would be the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC). Why is this important and concerning? Well, because under data sharing and cooperative agreements that FinCEN and the Egmont Group are a party to, this means that your information, to include your residential address, could be shared and made available around the world with the push of a button or a database query, and you would never know. Who are the Egmont Group? The Egmont Group, of which FinCEN is a member FIU, was founded in Brussels in 1995 as an international network to facilitate information sharing and dissemination to counter anti-money laundering and counterterrorism financing. It has been headquartered in Canada since 2008. According to its website: “As a global organization, the Egmont Group both facilitates and prompts the exchange of information, knowledge and cooperation amongst member FIUs.” The fact that information is shared, not only with allied “five eye” nations, but much wider through the Egmont Group’s FIU network, is of immediate concern. The Council for Financial Activities Control in Brazil, another member FIU, could conceivably have access to this shared information. Remember that Brazil is controlled by the far left socialist leadership under Lula da Silva. Do you want your information being shared with comrade Lula? Let’s not forget that Lula’s government is currently targeting Elon Musk, who has the resources to fight this, but what about “mom and pop” small business owners across the United States, who don’t have the same financial resources? The French equivalent to FinCEN is TRACFIN. No sane person would want their personal financial information being shared with Emmanuel Macron or his government. What about Mexico? Do you really trust your information with the Unidad de Inteligencia Financiera? Or what about Russia’s FIU? Or Venezuela’s FIU? How about Palestine? You can find the full list of Egmont Group FIU member states, including FinCEN here: Earlier this year FINTRAC, the Canadian equivalent to FinCEN was hacked. Canadian authorities still have no idea how bad this data breach actually was. Your information could be shared among multiple databases and FIU’s, including FINTRAC, exposing your personal and sensitive financial data, with no guarantees of security or privacy. Putting international data sharing concerns aside, the Federal Government in the US doesn’t have a positive track record for protecting personal data, either. Perhaps the best example of this was the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) breach, in 2015, under the Obama administration. But don’t worry, I’m sure the sensitive personal and financial data of millions of innocent small business owners will be safe with FinCEN. Most concerning is that the Egmont Group is based in Canada. Every FIU, including FinCEN, sits under a separate entity under Canadian jurisdiction. Does anyone really trust Justin Trudeau’s Canada and his unelected bureaucracy any more than they trust the unelected bureaucracy in America? Here is a list of the Egmont groups’ affiliate organizations: Vice President Kamala Harris wants to tout her “Opportunity Agenda” and her support of small businesses, yet her administration, of which she is the sitting Vice President, is moving at lightning speed to regulate and criminalize millions of small business owners in the United States. This includes massive fines and up to 2 years in federal prison.. The CTA is a clear violation of the 4th amendment, the 5th amendment and the 10th amendment. State Attorney General’s need to weigh in, urgently. Entity creation and registration has always been a States’ right issue. This is the largest first step the United States has ever taken towards nationalizing private business ownership under a federal umbrella. So what if you decide you want to close your business and not be forced to hand over your personal data to this terrorism and intelligence database? According to FinCEN, enforcement is retroactive. As long as you operated a small business for even one day in 2024, you are still required to self-report, even though you no longer own that business or it has been dissolved. Again, your failure to do so could land you in prison. The Corporate Transparency Act is not about “transparency” or “compliance”, it is about “control”. Unfortunately, without more citizen engagement, and without this being a front and center campaign issue, it seems that little will be done to stop this massive government overreach. If the legacy media won’t cover this then the alternative media like The Gateway Pundit, and citizen journalists will.

Small businesses are owned and managed by "the people."This is why they hate Trump. He is not part of the system. Though he is wealthy, he is independent and the Deep State couldn't control him. And he is a populist--the people's man--and the Deep State/Democrats/Elites hate the people.This is at the heart of this revolution. The Deep State--the government--believes it should be in charge. They don't believe the people are smart enough to have a say in the way the country is run. And the Democrats support the government.Eisenhower almost got it right...but he forgot about the permanent government when he warned us about the military/industrial complex.This is a revolution to destroy our representative government. And that will take the destruction of the Constitution.This is why the Democrats and the Deep State believe Trump and MAGA are an existential threat to their power.And they are right.If our country is to survive, Trump must win and the Democrats and the Deep State must be destroyed.There cannot be a compromise because our enemy will not accept a compromise.This is what Trump means when he speaks of our enemy within.

All materials posted herein are protected by copyright law and the exemption for fair use of copyrighted works. Free Republic Browse · Search Bloggers & Personal Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson What is FinCEN? Enforcement of the CTA falls under The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN); a bureau within the Department of Treasury. FinCEN’s mission statement reads: “FinCEN’s mission is to safeguard the financial system from illicit activity, counter money laundering and the financing of terrorism, and promote national security through strategic use of financial authorities and the collection, analysis, and dissemination of financial intelligence” The first question that we need to be asking is why are innocent small business owners being asked to provide all of their personal information to a federal database that reports directly to the Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence? Does the federal government classify all small business owners in the United States as “terrorists”? Secondly, the Department of Treasury is not known for its track record of impartiality. Non-profit organizations have previously been targeted by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), also housed under the same Department of Treasury. In 2013, the IRS, under Lois Lerner’s leadership targeted conservative non-profit groups with the name “tea party”, “patriot”, etc., and in a brazen act of political warfare, denied and/or revoked their non-profit status. The Corporate Transparency Act is nothing more than the “for profit” equivalent of the same non-profit Department of Treasury scandal of years back. Where is the guarantee that this database, housed under the Department of Treasury, will not be weaponized? FinCEN is creating a massive federal database of every single small business owner in the United States, with the potential of jail time for failure to self-report and massive fines. However, if your revenue is over 5 million, and you have 20 or more full time employees, you are exempt from this intrusive law and regulatory nightmare. This law does not apply to Blackrock, Pfizer, Apple, Google, Amazon, Facebook, etc. This law has been set up, exclusively, to target small business owners. Even more concerning is the fact that the National Department of Treasury Union has openly and unapologetically endorsed Kamala Harris for President. Partisan enforcement of CTA, by an unelected bureaucracy, against political enemies is not a question of “if”, but “when”. One especially alarming part of FinCEN’s mission statement reads: “…….security through strategic use of financial authorities and the collection, analysis, and dissemination of financial intelligence” “Dissemination” to who? Who does FinCEN share this data with? A World Wide Web of data sharing FinCEN is a member of the Egmont Group, and it serves as the United States’ Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) for the Egmont Group, as part of a wider network of 177 international FIU’s. In the UK the equivalent is the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) or the National Crimes Agency (NCA), who are also member FIU’s of the Egmont Group. The equivalent office to FinCEN in Canada would be the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC), also focused on Terrorism finance, and if you are “down under” in Australia it would be the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC). Why is this important and concerning? Well, because under data sharing and cooperative agreements that FinCEN and the Egmont Group are a party to, this means that your information, to include your residential address, could be shared and made available around the world with the push of a button or a database query, and you would never know. Who are the Egmont Group? The Egmont Group, of which FinCEN is a member FIU, was founded in Brussels in 1995 as an international network to facilitate information sharing and dissemination to counter anti-money laundering and counterterrorism financing. It has been headquartered in Canada since 2008. According to its website: “As a global organization, the Egmont Group both facilitates and prompts the exchange of information, knowledge and cooperation amongst member FIUs.” The fact that information is shared, not only with allied “five eye” nations, but much wider through the Egmont Group’s FIU network, is of immediate concern. The Council for Financial Activities Control in Brazil, another member FIU, could conceivably have access to this shared information. Remember that Brazil is controlled by the far left socialist leadership under Lula da Silva. Do you want your information being shared with comrade Lula? Let’s not forget that Lula’s government is currently targeting Elon Musk, who has the resources to fight this, but what about “mom and pop” small business owners across the United States, who don’t have the same financial resources? The French equivalent to FinCEN is TRACFIN. No sane person would want their personal financial information being shared with Emmanuel Macron or his government. What about Mexico? Do you really trust your information with the Unidad de Inteligencia Financiera? Or what about Russia’s FIU? Or Venezuela’s FIU? How about Palestine? You can find the full list of Egmont Group FIU member states, including FinCEN here: Earlier this year FINTRAC, the Canadian equivalent to FinCEN was hacked. Canadian authorities still have no idea how bad this data breach actually was. Your information could be shared among multiple databases and FIU’s, including FINTRAC, exposing your personal and sensitive financial data, with no guarantees of security or privacy. Putting international data sharing concerns aside, the Federal Government in the US doesn’t have a positive track record for protecting personal data, either. Perhaps the best example of this was the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) breach, in 2015, under the Obama administration. But don’t worry, I’m sure the sensitive personal and financial data of millions of innocent small business owners will be safe with FinCEN. Most concerning is that the Egmont Group is based in Canada. Every FIU, including FinCEN, sits under a separate entity under Canadian jurisdiction. Does anyone really trust Justin Trudeau’s Canada and his unelected bureaucracy any more than they trust the unelected bureaucracy in America? Here is a list of the Egmont groups’ affiliate organizations: Vice President Kamala Harris wants to tout her “Opportunity Agenda” and her support of small businesses, yet her administration, of which she is the sitting Vice President, is moving at lightning speed to regulate and criminalize millions of small business owners in the United States. This includes massive fines and up to 2 years in federal prison.. The CTA is a clear violation of the 4th amendment, the 5th amendment and the 10th amendment. State Attorney General’s need to weigh in, urgently. Entity creation and registration has always been a States’ right issue. This is the largest first step the United States has ever taken towards nationalizing private business ownership under a federal umbrella. So what if you decide you want to close your business and not be forced to hand over your personal data to this terrorism and intelligence database? According to FinCEN, enforcement is retroactive. As long as you operated a small business for even one day in 2024, you are still required to self-report, even though you no longer own that business or it has been dissolved. Again, your failure to do so could land you in prison. The Corporate Transparency Act is not about “transparency” or “compliance”, it is about “control”. Unfortunately, without more citizen engagement, and without this being a front and center campaign issue, it seems that little will be done to stop this massive government overreach. If the legacy media won’t cover this then the alternative media like The Gateway Pundit, and citizen journalists will.

If you had a business in an LLC or Corporation and sold the business but never closed the entity then you’re on the hook for this filing. If you were on an LLC filing for an ex-spouse that never closed the entity you’re on the hook for this even if you separated a decade ago.

Free Republic Browse · Search Bloggers & Personal Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson “FinCEN’s mission is to safeguard the financial system from illicit activity, counter money laundering and the financing of terrorism, and promote national security through strategic use of financial authorities and the collection, analysis, and dissemination of financial intelligence” The first question that we need to be asking is why are innocent small business owners being asked to provide all of their personal information to a federal database that reports directly to the Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence? Does the federal government classify all small business owners in the United States as “terrorists”? Secondly, the Department of Treasury is not known for its track record of impartiality. Non-profit organizations have previously been targeted by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), also housed under the same Department of Treasury. In 2013, the IRS, under Lois Lerner’s leadership targeted conservative non-profit groups with the name “tea party”, “patriot”, etc., and in a brazen act of political warfare, denied and/or revoked their non-profit status. The Corporate Transparency Act is nothing more than the “for profit” equivalent of the same non-profit Department of Treasury scandal of years back. Where is the guarantee that this database, housed under the Department of Treasury, will not be weaponized? FinCEN is creating a massive federal database of every single small business owner in the United States, with the potential of jail time for failure to self-report and massive fines. However, if your revenue is over 5 million, and you have 20 or more full time employees, you are exempt from this intrusive law and regulatory nightmare. This law does not apply to Blackrock, Pfizer, Apple, Google, Amazon, Facebook, etc. This law has been set up, exclusively, to target small business owners. Even more concerning is the fact that the National Department of Treasury Union has openly and unapologetically endorsed Kamala Harris for President. Partisan enforcement of CTA, by an unelected bureaucracy, against political enemies is not a question of “if”, but “when”. One especially alarming part of FinCEN’s mission statement reads: “…….security through strategic use of financial authorities and the collection, analysis, and dissemination of financial intelligence” “Dissemination” to who? Who does FinCEN share this data with? A World Wide Web of data sharing FinCEN is a member of the Egmont Group, and it serves as the United States’ Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) for the Egmont Group, as part of a wider network of 177 international FIU’s. In the UK the equivalent is the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) or the National Crimes Agency (NCA), who are also member FIU’s of the Egmont Group. The equivalent office to FinCEN in Canada would be the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC), also focused on Terrorism finance, and if you are “down under” in Australia it would be the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC). Why is this important and concerning? Well, because under data sharing and cooperative agreements that FinCEN and the Egmont Group are a party to, this means that your information, to include your residential address, could be shared and made available around the world with the push of a button or a database query, and you would never know. Who are the Egmont Group? The Egmont Group, of which FinCEN is a member FIU, was founded in Brussels in 1995 as an international network to facilitate information sharing and dissemination to counter anti-money laundering and counterterrorism financing. It has been headquartered in Canada since 2008. According to its website: “As a global organization, the Egmont Group both facilitates and prompts the exchange of information, knowledge and cooperation amongst member FIUs.” The fact that information is shared, not only with allied “five eye” nations, but much wider through the Egmont Group’s FIU network, is of immediate concern. The Council for Financial Activities Control in Brazil, another member FIU, could conceivably have access to this shared information. Remember that Brazil is controlled by the far left socialist leadership under Lula da Silva. Do you want your information being shared with comrade Lula? Let’s not forget that Lula’s government is currently targeting Elon Musk, who has the resources to fight this, but what about “mom and pop” small business owners across the United States, who don’t have the same financial resources? The French equivalent to FinCEN is TRACFIN. No sane person would want their personal financial information being shared with Emmanuel Macron or his government. What about Mexico? Do you really trust your information with the Unidad de Inteligencia Financiera? Or what about Russia’s FIU? Or Venezuela’s FIU? How about Palestine? You can find the full list of Egmont Group FIU member states, including FinCEN here: Earlier this year FINTRAC, the Canadian equivalent to FinCEN was hacked. Canadian authorities still have no idea how bad this data breach actually was. Your information could be shared among multiple databases and FIU’s, including FINTRAC, exposing your personal and sensitive financial data, with no guarantees of security or privacy. Putting international data sharing concerns aside, the Federal Government in the US doesn’t have a positive track record for protecting personal data, either. Perhaps the best example of this was the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) breach, in 2015, under the Obama administration. But don’t worry, I’m sure the sensitive personal and financial data of millions of innocent small business owners will be safe with FinCEN. Most concerning is that the Egmont Group is based in Canada. Every FIU, including FinCEN, sits under a separate entity under Canadian jurisdiction. Does anyone really trust Justin Trudeau’s Canada and his unelected bureaucracy any more than they trust the unelected bureaucracy in America? Here is a list of the Egmont groups’ affiliate organizations: Vice President Kamala Harris wants to tout her “Opportunity Agenda” and her support of small businesses, yet her administration, of which she is the sitting Vice President, is moving at lightning speed to regulate and criminalize millions of small business owners in the United States. This includes massive fines and up to 2 years in federal prison.. The CTA is a clear violation of the 4th amendment, the 5th amendment and the 10th amendment. State Attorney General’s need to weigh in, urgently. Entity creation and registration has always been a States’ right issue. This is the largest first step the United States has ever taken towards nationalizing private business ownership under a federal umbrella. So what if you decide you want to close your business and not be forced to hand over your personal data to this terrorism and intelligence database? According to FinCEN, enforcement is retroactive. As long as you operated a small business for even one day in 2024, you are still required to self-report, even though you no longer own that business or it has been dissolved. Again, your failure to do so could land you in prison. The Corporate Transparency Act is not about “transparency” or “compliance”, it is about “control”. Unfortunately, without more citizen engagement, and without this being a front and center campaign issue, it seems that little will be done to stop this massive government overreach. If the legacy media won’t cover this then the alternative media like The Gateway Pundit, and citizen journalists will.

Non-profit organizations have previously been targeted by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), also housed under the same Department of Treasury. In 2013, the IRS, under Lois Lerner’s leadership targeted conservative non-profit groups with the name “tea party”, “patriot”, etc., and in a brazen act of political warfare, denied and/or revoked their non-profit status. The Corporate Transparency Act is nothing more than the “for profit” equivalent of the same non-profit Department of Treasury scandal of years back. Where is the guarantee that this database, housed under the Department of Treasury, will not be weaponized? FinCEN is creating a massive federal database of every single small business owner in the United States, with the potential of jail time for failure to self-report and massive fines. However, if your revenue is over 5 million, and you have 20 or more full time employees, you are exempt from this intrusive law and regulatory nightmare. This law does not apply to Blackrock, Pfizer, Apple, Google, Amazon, Facebook, etc. This law has been set up, exclusively, to target small business owners. Even more concerning is the fact that the National Department of Treasury Union has openly and unapologetically endorsed Kamala Harris for President. Partisan enforcement of CTA, by an unelected bureaucracy, against political enemies is not a question of “if”, but “when”. One especially alarming part of FinCEN’s mission statement reads: “…….security through strategic use of financial authorities and the collection, analysis, and dissemination of financial intelligence” “Dissemination” to who? Who does FinCEN share this data with? A World Wide Web of data sharing FinCEN is a member of the Egmont Group, and it serves as the United States’ Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) for the Egmont Group, as part of a wider network of 177 international FIU’s. In the UK the equivalent is the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) or the National Crimes Agency (NCA), who are also member FIU’s of the Egmont Group. The equivalent office to FinCEN in Canada would be the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC), also focused on Terrorism finance, and if you are “down under” in Australia it would be the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC). Why is this important and concerning? Well, because under data sharing and cooperative agreements that FinCEN and the Egmont Group are a party to, this means that your information, to include your residential address, could be shared and made available around the world with the push of a button or a database query, and you would never know. Who are the Egmont Group? The Egmont Group, of which FinCEN is a member FIU, was founded in Brussels in 1995 as an international network to facilitate information sharing and dissemination to counter anti-money laundering and counterterrorism financing. It has been headquartered in Canada since 2008. According to its website: “As a global organization, the Egmont Group both facilitates and prompts the exchange of information, knowledge and cooperation amongst member FIUs.” The fact that information is shared, not only with allied “five eye” nations, but much wider through the Egmont Group’s FIU network, is of immediate concern. The Council for Financial Activities Control in Brazil, another member FIU, could conceivably have access to this shared information. Remember that Brazil is controlled by the far left socialist leadership under Lula da Silva. Do you want your information being shared with comrade Lula? Let’s not forget that Lula’s government is currently targeting Elon Musk, who has the resources to fight this, but what about “mom and pop” small business owners across the United States, who don’t have the same financial resources? The French equivalent to FinCEN is TRACFIN. No sane person would want their personal financial information being shared with Emmanuel Macron or his government. What about Mexico? Do you really trust your information with the Unidad de Inteligencia Financiera? Or what about Russia’s FIU? Or Venezuela’s FIU? How about Palestine? You can find the full list of Egmont Group FIU member states, including FinCEN here: Earlier this year FINTRAC, the Canadian equivalent to FinCEN was hacked. Canadian authorities still have no idea how bad this data breach actually was. Your information could be shared among multiple databases and FIU’s, including FINTRAC, exposing your personal and sensitive financial data, with no guarantees of security or privacy. Putting international data sharing concerns aside, the Federal Government in the US doesn’t have a positive track record for protecting personal data, either. Perhaps the best example of this was the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) breach, in 2015, under the Obama administration. But don’t worry, I’m sure the sensitive personal and financial data of millions of innocent small business owners will be safe with FinCEN. Most concerning is that the Egmont Group is based in Canada. Every FIU, including FinCEN, sits under a separate entity under Canadian jurisdiction. Does anyone really trust Justin Trudeau’s Canada and his unelected bureaucracy any more than they trust the unelected bureaucracy in America? Here is a list of the Egmont groups’ affiliate organizations: Vice President Kamala Harris wants to tout her “Opportunity Agenda” and her support of small businesses, yet her administration, of which she is the sitting Vice President, is moving at lightning speed to regulate and criminalize millions of small business owners in the United States. This includes massive fines and up to 2 years in federal prison.. The CTA is a clear violation of the 4th amendment, the 5th amendment and the 10th amendment. State Attorney General’s need to weigh in, urgently. Entity creation and registration has always been a States’ right issue. This is the largest first step the United States has ever taken towards nationalizing private business ownership under a federal umbrella. So what if you decide you want to close your business and not be forced to hand over your personal data to this terrorism and intelligence database? According to FinCEN, enforcement is retroactive. As long as you operated a small business for even one day in 2024, you are still required to self-report, even though you no longer own that business or it has been dissolved. Again, your failure to do so could land you in prison. The Corporate Transparency Act is not about “transparency” or “compliance”, it is about “control”. Unfortunately, without more citizen engagement, and without this being a front and center campaign issue, it seems that little will be done to stop this massive government overreach. If the legacy media won’t cover this then the alternative media like The Gateway Pundit, and citizen journalists will.

As long as you operated a small business for even one day in 2024, you are still required to self-report, even though you no longer own that business or it has been dissolved. Again, your failure to do so could land you in prison. The Corporate Transparency Act is not about “transparency” or “compliance”, it is about “control”. Unfortunately, without more citizen engagement, and without this being a front and center campaign issue, it seems that little will be done to stop this massive government overreach. If the legacy media won’t cover this then the alternative media like The Gateway Pundit, and citizen journalists will.

Free Republic Browse · Search Bloggers & Personal Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson The Corporate Transparency Act is nothing more than the “for profit” equivalent of the same non-profit Department of Treasury scandal of years back. Where is the guarantee that this database, housed under the Department of Treasury, will not be weaponized? FinCEN is creating a massive federal database of every single small business owner in the United States, with the potential of jail time for failure to self-report and massive fines. However, if your revenue is over 5 million, and you have 20 or more full time employees, you are exempt from this intrusive law and regulatory nightmare. This law does not apply to Blackrock, Pfizer, Apple, Google, Amazon, Facebook, etc. This law has been set up, exclusively, to target small business owners. Even more concerning is the fact that the National Department of Treasury Union has openly and unapologetically endorsed Kamala Harris for President. Partisan enforcement of CTA, by an unelected bureaucracy, against political enemies is not a question of “if”, but “when”. One especially alarming part of FinCEN’s mission statement reads: “…….security through strategic use of financial authorities and the collection, analysis, and dissemination of financial intelligence” “Dissemination” to who? Who does FinCEN share this data with? A World Wide Web of data sharing FinCEN is a member of the Egmont Group, and it serves as the United States’ Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) for the Egmont Group, as part of a wider network of 177 international FIU’s. In the UK the equivalent is the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) or the National Crimes Agency (NCA), who are also member FIU’s of the Egmont Group. The equivalent office to FinCEN in Canada would be the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC), also focused on Terrorism finance, and if you are “down under” in Australia it would be the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC). Why is this important and concerning? Well, because under data sharing and cooperative agreements that FinCEN and the Egmont Group are a party to, this means that your information, to include your residential address, could be shared and made available around the world with the push of a button or a database query, and you would never know. Who are the Egmont Group? The Egmont Group, of which FinCEN is a member FIU, was founded in Brussels in 1995 as an international network to facilitate information sharing and dissemination to counter anti-money laundering and counterterrorism financing. It has been headquartered in Canada since 2008. According to its website: “As a global organization, the Egmont Group both facilitates and prompts the exchange of information, knowledge and cooperation amongst member FIUs.” The fact that information is shared, not only with allied “five eye” nations, but much wider through the Egmont Group’s FIU network, is of immediate concern. The Council for Financial Activities Control in Brazil, another member FIU, could conceivably have access to this shared information. Remember that Brazil is controlled by the far left socialist leadership under Lula da Silva. Do you want your information being shared with comrade Lula? Let’s not forget that Lula’s government is currently targeting Elon Musk, who has the resources to fight this, but what about “mom and pop” small business owners across the United States, who don’t have the same financial resources? The French equivalent to FinCEN is TRACFIN. No sane person would want their personal financial information being shared with Emmanuel Macron or his government. What about Mexico? Do you really trust your information with the Unidad de Inteligencia Financiera? Or what about Russia’s FIU? Or Venezuela’s FIU? How about Palestine? You can find the full list of Egmont Group FIU member states, including FinCEN here: Earlier this year FINTRAC, the Canadian equivalent to FinCEN was hacked. Canadian authorities still have no idea how bad this data breach actually was. Your information could be shared among multiple databases and FIU’s, including FINTRAC, exposing your personal and sensitive financial data, with no guarantees of security or privacy. Putting international data sharing concerns aside, the Federal Government in the US doesn’t have a positive track record for protecting personal data, either. Perhaps the best example of this was the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) breach, in 2015, under the Obama administration. But don’t worry, I’m sure the sensitive personal and financial data of millions of innocent small business owners will be safe with FinCEN. Most concerning is that the Egmont Group is based in Canada. Every FIU, including FinCEN, sits under a separate entity under Canadian jurisdiction. Does anyone really trust Justin Trudeau’s Canada and his unelected bureaucracy any more than they trust the unelected bureaucracy in America? Here is a list of the Egmont groups’ affiliate organizations: Vice President Kamala Harris wants to tout her “Opportunity Agenda” and her support of small businesses, yet her administration, of which she is the sitting Vice President, is moving at lightning speed to regulate and criminalize millions of small business owners in the United States. This includes massive fines and up to 2 years in federal prison.. The CTA is a clear violation of the 4th amendment, the 5th amendment and the 10th amendment. State Attorney General’s need to weigh in, urgently. Entity creation and registration has always been a States’ right issue. This is the largest first step the United States has ever taken towards nationalizing private business ownership under a federal umbrella. So what if you decide you want to close your business and not be forced to hand over your personal data to this terrorism and intelligence database? According to FinCEN, enforcement is retroactive. As long as you operated a small business for even one day in 2024, you are still required to self-report, even though you no longer own that business or it has been dissolved.

Unfortunately, without more citizen engagement, and without this being a front and center campaign issue, it seems that little will be done to stop this massive government overreach.

Free Republic Browse · Search Bloggers & Personal Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Even more concerning is the fact that the National Department of Treasury Union has openly and unapologetically endorsed Kamala Harris for President. Partisan enforcement of CTA, by an unelected bureaucracy, against political enemies is not a question of “if”, but “when”. One especially alarming part of FinCEN’s mission statement reads: “…….security through strategic use of financial authorities and the collection, analysis, and dissemination of financial intelligence” “Dissemination” to who? Who does FinCEN share this data with? A World Wide Web of data sharing FinCEN is a member of the Egmont Group, and it serves as the United States’ Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) for the Egmont Group, as part of a wider network of 177 international FIU’s. In the UK the equivalent is the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) or the National Crimes Agency (NCA), who are also member FIU’s of the Egmont Group. The equivalent office to FinCEN in Canada would be the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC), also focused on Terrorism finance, and if you are “down under” in Australia it would be the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC). Why is this important and concerning? Well, because under data sharing and cooperative agreements that FinCEN and the Egmont Group are a party to, this means that your information, to include your residential address, could be shared and made available around the world with the push of a button or a database query, and you would never know. Who are the Egmont Group? The Egmont Group, of which FinCEN is a member FIU, was founded in Brussels in 1995 as an international network to facilitate information sharing and dissemination to counter anti-money laundering and counterterrorism financing. It has been headquartered in Canada since 2008. According to its website: “As a global organization, the Egmont Group both facilitates and prompts the exchange of information, knowledge and cooperation amongst member FIUs.” The fact that information is shared, not only with allied “five eye” nations, but much wider through the Egmont Group’s FIU network, is of immediate concern. The Council for Financial Activities Control in Brazil, another member FIU, could conceivably have access to this shared information. Remember that Brazil is controlled by the far left socialist leadership under Lula da Silva. Do you want your information being shared with comrade Lula? Let’s not forget that Lula’s government is currently targeting Elon Musk, who has the resources to fight this, but what about “mom and pop” small business owners across the United States, who don’t have the same financial resources? The French equivalent to FinCEN is TRACFIN. No sane person would want their personal financial information being shared with Emmanuel Macron or his government. What about Mexico? Do you really trust your information with the Unidad de Inteligencia Financiera? Or what about Russia’s FIU? Or Venezuela’s FIU? How about Palestine? You can find the full list of Egmont Group FIU member states, including FinCEN here: Earlier this year FINTRAC, the Canadian equivalent to FinCEN was hacked. Canadian authorities still have no idea how bad this data breach actually was. Your information could be shared among multiple databases and FIU’s, including FINTRAC, exposing your personal and sensitive financial data, with no guarantees of security or privacy. Putting international data sharing concerns aside, the Federal Government in the US doesn’t have a positive track record for protecting personal data, either. Perhaps the best example of this was the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) breach, in 2015, under the Obama administration. But don’t worry, I’m sure the sensitive personal and financial data of millions of innocent small business owners will be safe with FinCEN. Most concerning is that the Egmont Group is based in Canada. Every FIU, including FinCEN, sits under a separate entity under Canadian jurisdiction. Does anyone really trust Justin Trudeau’s Canada and his unelected bureaucracy any more than they trust the unelected bureaucracy in America? Here is a list of the Egmont groups’ affiliate organizations: Vice President Kamala Harris wants to tout her “Opportunity Agenda” and her support of small businesses, yet her administration, of which she is the sitting Vice President, is moving at lightning speed to regulate and criminalize millions of small business owners in the United States. This includes massive fines and up to 2 years in federal prison.. The CTA is a clear violation of the 4th amendment, the 5th amendment and the 10th amendment. State Attorney General’s need to weigh in, urgently. Entity creation and registration has always been a States’ right issue. This is the largest first step the United States has ever taken towards nationalizing private business ownership under a federal umbrella. So what if you decide you want to close your business and not be forced to hand over your personal data to this terrorism and intelligence database? According to FinCEN, enforcement is retroactive. As long as you operated a small business for even one day in 2024, you are still required to self-report, even though you no longer own that business or it has been dissolved. Again, your failure to do so could land you in prison. The Corporate Transparency Act is not about “transparency” or “compliance”, it is about “control”.

A federal judge determined that the reporting was unconstitutional but his injunction ONLY applied to the parties to the case. The fines for this thing are extortionate. If you set up an LLC for a rental property 30 years ago and never closed it then you’re on the hook for this filing. If you had a business in an LLC or Corporation and sold the business but never closed the entity then you’re on the hook for this filing. If you were on an LLC filing for an ex-spouse that never closed the entity you’re on the hook for this even if you separated a decade ago. It’s insanity. 4 posted on 10/25/2024 3:33:21 PM PDT by Tucsonican [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: I want the USA back; george76 --- "Our government is even more fascist than I thought."

Free Republic Browse · Search Bloggers & Personal Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson “…….security through strategic use of financial authorities and the collection, analysis, and dissemination of financial intelligence” “Dissemination” to who? Who does FinCEN share this data with? A World Wide Web of data sharing FinCEN is a member of the Egmont Group, and it serves as the United States’ Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) for the Egmont Group, as part of a wider network of 177 international FIU’s. In the UK the equivalent is the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) or the National Crimes Agency (NCA), who are also member FIU’s of the Egmont Group. The equivalent office to FinCEN in Canada would be the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC), also focused on Terrorism finance, and if you are “down under” in Australia it would be the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC). Why is this important and concerning? Well, because under data sharing and cooperative agreements that FinCEN and the Egmont Group are a party to, this means that your information, to include your residential address, could be shared and made available around the world with the push of a button or a database query, and you would never know. Who are the Egmont Group? The Egmont Group, of which FinCEN is a member FIU, was founded in Brussels in 1995 as an international network to facilitate information sharing and dissemination to counter anti-money laundering and counterterrorism financing. It has been headquartered in Canada since 2008. According to its website: “As a global organization, the Egmont Group both facilitates and prompts the exchange of information, knowledge and cooperation amongst member FIUs.” The fact that information is shared, not only with allied “five eye” nations, but much wider through the Egmont Group’s FIU network, is of immediate concern. The Council for Financial Activities Control in Brazil, another member FIU, could conceivably have access to this shared information. Remember that Brazil is controlled by the far left socialist leadership under Lula da Silva. Do you want your information being shared with comrade Lula? Let’s not forget that Lula’s government is currently targeting Elon Musk, who has the resources to fight this, but what about “mom and pop” small business owners across the United States, who don’t have the same financial resources? The French equivalent to FinCEN is TRACFIN. No sane person would want their personal financial information being shared with Emmanuel Macron or his government. What about Mexico? Do you really trust your information with the Unidad de Inteligencia Financiera? Or what about Russia’s FIU? Or Venezuela’s FIU? How about Palestine? You can find the full list of Egmont Group FIU member states, including FinCEN here: Earlier this year FINTRAC, the Canadian equivalent to FinCEN was hacked. Canadian authorities still have no idea how bad this data breach actually was. Your information could be shared among multiple databases and FIU’s, including FINTRAC, exposing your personal and sensitive financial data, with no guarantees of security or privacy. Putting international data sharing concerns aside, the Federal Government in the US doesn’t have a positive track record for protecting personal data, either. Perhaps the best example of this was the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) breach, in 2015, under the Obama administration. But don’t worry, I’m sure the sensitive personal and financial data of millions of innocent small business owners will be safe with FinCEN. Most concerning is that the Egmont Group is based in Canada. Every FIU, including FinCEN, sits under a separate entity under Canadian jurisdiction. Does anyone really trust Justin Trudeau’s Canada and his unelected bureaucracy any more than they trust the unelected bureaucracy in America? Here is a list of the Egmont groups’ affiliate organizations: Vice President Kamala Harris wants to tout her “Opportunity Agenda” and her support of small businesses, yet her administration, of which she is the sitting Vice President, is moving at lightning speed to regulate and criminalize millions of small business owners in the United States. This includes massive fines and up to 2 years in federal prison.. The CTA is a clear violation of the 4th amendment, the 5th amendment and the 10th amendment. State Attorney General’s need to weigh in, urgently. Entity creation and registration has always been a States’ right issue. This is the largest first step the United States has ever taken towards nationalizing private business ownership under a federal umbrella. So what if you decide you want to close your business and not be forced to hand over your personal data to this terrorism and intelligence database? According to FinCEN, enforcement is retroactive. As long as you operated a small business for even one day in 2024, you are still required to self-report, even though you no longer own that business or it has been dissolved. Again, your failure to do so could land you in prison. The Corporate Transparency Act is not about “transparency” or “compliance”, it is about “control”. Unfortunately, without more citizen engagement, and without this being a front and center campaign issue, it seems that little will be done to stop this massive government overreach. If the legacy media won’t cover this then the alternative media like The Gateway Pundit, and citizen journalists will.

Free Republic Browse · Search Bloggers & Personal Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson A World Wide Web of data sharing FinCEN is a member of the Egmont Group, and it serves as the United States’ Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) for the Egmont Group, as part of a wider network of 177 international FIU’s. In the UK the equivalent is the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) or the National Crimes Agency (NCA), who are also member FIU’s of the Egmont Group. The equivalent office to FinCEN in Canada would be the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC), also focused on Terrorism finance, and if you are “down under” in Australia it would be the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC). Why is this important and concerning? Well, because under data sharing and cooperative agreements that FinCEN and the Egmont Group are a party to, this means that your information, to include your residential address, could be shared and made available around the world with the push of a button or a database query, and you would never know. Who are the Egmont Group? The Egmont Group, of which FinCEN is a member FIU, was founded in Brussels in 1995 as an international network to facilitate information sharing and dissemination to counter anti-money laundering and counterterrorism financing. It has been headquartered in Canada since 2008. According to its website: “As a global organization, the Egmont Group both facilitates and prompts the exchange of information, knowledge and cooperation amongst member FIUs.” The fact that information is shared, not only with allied “five eye” nations, but much wider through the Egmont Group’s FIU network, is of immediate concern. The Council for Financial Activities Control in Brazil, another member FIU, could conceivably have access to this shared information. Remember that Brazil is controlled by the far left socialist leadership under Lula da Silva. Do you want your information being shared with comrade Lula? Let’s not forget that Lula’s government is currently targeting Elon Musk, who has the resources to fight this, but what about “mom and pop” small business owners across the United States, who don’t have the same financial resources? The French equivalent to FinCEN is TRACFIN. No sane person would want their personal financial information being shared with Emmanuel Macron or his government. What about Mexico? Do you really trust your information with the Unidad de Inteligencia Financiera? Or what about Russia’s FIU? Or Venezuela’s FIU? How about Palestine? You can find the full list of Egmont Group FIU member states, including FinCEN here: Earlier this year FINTRAC, the Canadian equivalent to FinCEN was hacked. Canadian authorities still have no idea how bad this data breach actually was. Your information could be shared among multiple databases and FIU’s, including FINTRAC, exposing your personal and sensitive financial data, with no guarantees of security or privacy. Putting international data sharing concerns aside, the Federal Government in the US doesn’t have a positive track record for protecting personal data, either. Perhaps the best example of this was the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) breach, in 2015, under the Obama administration. But don’t worry, I’m sure the sensitive personal and financial data of millions of innocent small business owners will be safe with FinCEN. Most concerning is that the Egmont Group is based in Canada. Every FIU, including FinCEN, sits under a separate entity under Canadian jurisdiction. Does anyone really trust Justin Trudeau’s Canada and his unelected bureaucracy any more than they trust the unelected bureaucracy in America? Here is a list of the Egmont groups’ affiliate organizations: Vice President Kamala Harris wants to tout her “Opportunity Agenda” and her support of small businesses, yet her administration, of which she is the sitting Vice President, is moving at lightning speed to regulate and criminalize millions of small business owners in the United States. This includes massive fines and up to 2 years in federal prison.. The CTA is a clear violation of the 4th amendment, the 5th amendment and the 10th amendment. State Attorney General’s need to weigh in, urgently. Entity creation and registration has always been a States’ right issue. This is the largest first step the United States has ever taken towards nationalizing private business ownership under a federal umbrella. So what if you decide you want to close your business and not be forced to hand over your personal data to this terrorism and intelligence database? According to FinCEN, enforcement is retroactive. As long as you operated a small business for even one day in 2024, you are still required to self-report, even though you no longer own that business or it has been dissolved. Again, your failure to do so could land you in prison. The Corporate Transparency Act is not about “transparency” or “compliance”, it is about “control”. Unfortunately, without more citizen engagement, and without this being a front and center campaign issue, it seems that little will be done to stop this massive government overreach. If the legacy media won’t cover this then the alternative media like The Gateway Pundit, and citizen journalists will.

Free Republic Browse · Search Bloggers & Personal Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson In the UK the equivalent is the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) or the National Crimes Agency (NCA), who are also member FIU’s of the Egmont Group. The equivalent office to FinCEN in Canada would be the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC), also focused on Terrorism finance, and if you are “down under” in Australia it would be the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC). Why is this important and concerning? Well, because under data sharing and cooperative agreements that FinCEN and the Egmont Group are a party to, this means that your information, to include your residential address, could be shared and made available around the world with the push of a button or a database query, and you would never know. Who are the Egmont Group? The Egmont Group, of which FinCEN is a member FIU, was founded in Brussels in 1995 as an international network to facilitate information sharing and dissemination to counter anti-money laundering and counterterrorism financing. It has been headquartered in Canada since 2008. According to its website: “As a global organization, the Egmont Group both facilitates and prompts the exchange of information, knowledge and cooperation amongst member FIUs.” The fact that information is shared, not only with allied “five eye” nations, but much wider through the Egmont Group’s FIU network, is of immediate concern. The Council for Financial Activities Control in Brazil, another member FIU, could conceivably have access to this shared information. Remember that Brazil is controlled by the far left socialist leadership under Lula da Silva. Do you want your information being shared with comrade Lula? Let’s not forget that Lula’s government is currently targeting Elon Musk, who has the resources to fight this, but what about “mom and pop” small business owners across the United States, who don’t have the same financial resources? The French equivalent to FinCEN is TRACFIN. No sane person would want their personal financial information being shared with Emmanuel Macron or his government. What about Mexico? Do you really trust your information with the Unidad de Inteligencia Financiera? Or what about Russia’s FIU? Or Venezuela’s FIU? How about Palestine? You can find the full list of Egmont Group FIU member states, including FinCEN here: Earlier this year FINTRAC, the Canadian equivalent to FinCEN was hacked. Canadian authorities still have no idea how bad this data breach actually was. Your information could be shared among multiple databases and FIU’s, including FINTRAC, exposing your personal and sensitive financial data, with no guarantees of security or privacy. Putting international data sharing concerns aside, the Federal Government in the US doesn’t have a positive track record for protecting personal data, either. Perhaps the best example of this was the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) breach, in 2015, under the Obama administration. But don’t worry, I’m sure the sensitive personal and financial data of millions of innocent small business owners will be safe with FinCEN. Most concerning is that the Egmont Group is based in Canada. Every FIU, including FinCEN, sits under a separate entity under Canadian jurisdiction. Does anyone really trust Justin Trudeau’s Canada and his unelected bureaucracy any more than they trust the unelected bureaucracy in America? Here is a list of the Egmont groups’ affiliate organizations: Vice President Kamala Harris wants to tout her “Opportunity Agenda” and her support of small businesses, yet her administration, of which she is the sitting Vice President, is moving at lightning speed to regulate and criminalize millions of small business owners in the United States. This includes massive fines and up to 2 years in federal prison.. The CTA is a clear violation of the 4th amendment, the 5th amendment and the 10th amendment. State Attorney General’s need to weigh in, urgently. Entity creation and registration has always been a States’ right issue. This is the largest first step the United States has ever taken towards nationalizing private business ownership under a federal umbrella. So what if you decide you want to close your business and not be forced to hand over your personal data to this terrorism and intelligence database? According to FinCEN, enforcement is retroactive. As long as you operated a small business for even one day in 2024, you are still required to self-report, even though you no longer own that business or it has been dissolved. Again, your failure to do so could land you in prison. The Corporate Transparency Act is not about “transparency” or “compliance”, it is about “control”. Unfortunately, without more citizen engagement, and without this being a front and center campaign issue, it seems that little will be done to stop this massive government overreach. If the legacy media won’t cover this then the alternative media like The Gateway Pundit, and citizen journalists will.

Free Republic Browse · Search Bloggers & Personal Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Who are the Egmont Group? The Egmont Group, of which FinCEN is a member FIU, was founded in Brussels in 1995 as an international network to facilitate information sharing and dissemination to counter anti-money laundering and counterterrorism financing. It has been headquartered in Canada since 2008. According to its website: “As a global organization, the Egmont Group both facilitates and prompts the exchange of information, knowledge and cooperation amongst member FIUs.” The fact that information is shared, not only with allied “five eye” nations, but much wider through the Egmont Group’s FIU network, is of immediate concern. The Council for Financial Activities Control in Brazil, another member FIU, could conceivably have access to this shared information. Remember that Brazil is controlled by the far left socialist leadership under Lula da Silva. Do you want your information being shared with comrade Lula? Let’s not forget that Lula’s government is currently targeting Elon Musk, who has the resources to fight this, but what about “mom and pop” small business owners across the United States, who don’t have the same financial resources? The French equivalent to FinCEN is TRACFIN. No sane person would want their personal financial information being shared with Emmanuel Macron or his government. What about Mexico? Do you really trust your information with the Unidad de Inteligencia Financiera? Or what about Russia’s FIU? Or Venezuela’s FIU? How about Palestine? You can find the full list of Egmont Group FIU member states, including FinCEN here: Earlier this year FINTRAC, the Canadian equivalent to FinCEN was hacked. Canadian authorities still have no idea how bad this data breach actually was. Your information could be shared among multiple databases and FIU’s, including FINTRAC, exposing your personal and sensitive financial data, with no guarantees of security or privacy. Putting international data sharing concerns aside, the Federal Government in the US doesn’t have a positive track record for protecting personal data, either. Perhaps the best example of this was the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) breach, in 2015, under the Obama administration. But don’t worry, I’m sure the sensitive personal and financial data of millions of innocent small business owners will be safe with FinCEN. Most concerning is that the Egmont Group is based in Canada. Every FIU, including FinCEN, sits under a separate entity under Canadian jurisdiction. Does anyone really trust Justin Trudeau’s Canada and his unelected bureaucracy any more than they trust the unelected bureaucracy in America? Here is a list of the Egmont groups’ affiliate organizations: Vice President Kamala Harris wants to tout her “Opportunity Agenda” and her support of small businesses, yet her administration, of which she is the sitting Vice President, is moving at lightning speed to regulate and criminalize millions of small business owners in the United States. This includes massive fines and up to 2 years in federal prison.. The CTA is a clear violation of the 4th amendment, the 5th amendment and the 10th amendment. State Attorney General’s need to weigh in, urgently. Entity creation and registration has always been a States’ right issue. This is the largest first step the United States has ever taken towards nationalizing private business ownership under a federal umbrella. So what if you decide you want to close your business and not be forced to hand over your personal data to this terrorism and intelligence database? According to FinCEN, enforcement is retroactive. As long as you operated a small business for even one day in 2024, you are still required to self-report, even though you no longer own that business or it has been dissolved. Again, your failure to do so could land you in prison. The Corporate Transparency Act is not about “transparency” or “compliance”, it is about “control”. Unfortunately, without more citizen engagement, and without this being a front and center campaign issue, it seems that little will be done to stop this massive government overreach. If the legacy media won’t cover this then the alternative media like The Gateway Pundit, and citizen journalists will.

But don’t worry, I’m sure the sensitive personal and financial data of millions of innocent small business owners will be safe with FinCEN. Most concerning is that the Egmont Group is based in Canada. Every FIU, including FinCEN, sits under a separate entity under Canadian jurisdiction. Does anyone really trust Justin Trudeau’s Canada and his unelected bureaucracy any more than they trust the unelected bureaucracy in America? Here is a list of the Egmont groups’ affiliate organizations: Vice President Kamala Harris wants to tout her “Opportunity Agenda” and her support of small businesses, yet her administration, of which she is the sitting Vice President, is moving at lightning speed to regulate and criminalize millions of small business owners in the United States. This includes massive fines and up to 2 years in federal prison.. The CTA is a clear violation of the 4th amendment, the 5th amendment and the 10th amendment. State Attorney General’s need to weigh in, urgently. Entity creation and registration has always been a States’ right issue. This is the largest first step the United States has ever taken towards nationalizing private business ownership under a federal umbrella. So what if you decide you want to close your business and not be forced to hand over your personal data to this terrorism and intelligence database? According to FinCEN, enforcement is retroactive. As long as you operated a small business for even one day in 2024, you are still required to self-report, even though you no longer own that business or it has been dissolved. Again, your failure to do so could land you in prison. The Corporate Transparency Act is not about “transparency” or “compliance”, it is about “control”. Unfortunately, without more citizen engagement, and without this being a front and center campaign issue, it seems that little will be done to stop this massive government overreach. If the legacy media won’t cover this then the alternative media like The Gateway Pundit, and citizen journalists will.

Remember that Brazil is controlled by the far left socialist leadership under Lula da Silva. Do you want your information being shared with comrade Lula? Let’s not forget that Lula’s government is currently targeting Elon Musk, who has the resources to fight this, but what about “mom and pop” small business owners across the United States, who don’t have the same financial resources? The French equivalent to FinCEN is TRACFIN. No sane person would want their personal financial information being shared with Emmanuel Macron or his government. What about Mexico? Do you really trust your information with the Unidad de Inteligencia Financiera? Or what about Russia’s FIU? Or Venezuela’s FIU? How about Palestine? You can find the full list of Egmont Group FIU member states, including FinCEN here: Earlier this year FINTRAC, the Canadian equivalent to FinCEN was hacked. Canadian authorities still have no idea how bad this data breach actually was. Your information could be shared among multiple databases and FIU’s, including FINTRAC, exposing your personal and sensitive financial data, with no guarantees of security or privacy. Putting international data sharing concerns aside, the Federal Government in the US doesn’t have a positive track record for protecting personal data, either. Perhaps the best example of this was the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) breach, in 2015, under the Obama administration. But don’t worry, I’m sure the sensitive personal and financial data of millions of innocent small business owners will be safe with FinCEN. Most concerning is that the Egmont Group is based in Canada. Every FIU, including FinCEN, sits under a separate entity under Canadian jurisdiction. Does anyone really trust Justin Trudeau’s Canada and his unelected bureaucracy any more than they trust the unelected bureaucracy in America? Here is a list of the Egmont groups’ affiliate organizations: Vice President Kamala Harris wants to tout her “Opportunity Agenda” and her support of small businesses, yet her administration, of which she is the sitting Vice President, is moving at lightning speed to regulate and criminalize millions of small business owners in the United States. This includes massive fines and up to 2 years in federal prison.. The CTA is a clear violation of the 4th amendment, the 5th amendment and the 10th amendment. State Attorney General’s need to weigh in, urgently. Entity creation and registration has always been a States’ right issue. This is the largest first step the United States has ever taken towards nationalizing private business ownership under a federal umbrella. So what if you decide you want to close your business and not be forced to hand over your personal data to this terrorism and intelligence database? According to FinCEN, enforcement is retroactive. As long as you operated a small business for even one day in 2024, you are still required to self-report, even though you no longer own that business or it has been dissolved. Again, your failure to do so could land you in prison. The Corporate Transparency Act is not about “transparency” or “compliance”, it is about “control”. Unfortunately, without more citizen engagement, and without this being a front and center campaign issue, it seems that little will be done to stop this massive government overreach. If the legacy media won’t cover this then the alternative media like The Gateway Pundit, and citizen journalists will.

This reporting requirement is one of the most egregious abuses of government power I have ever witnessed and it’s a direct violation of the 4th Amendment.

A federal judge determined that the reporting was unconstitutional but his injunction ONLY applied to the parties to the case. The fines for this thing are extortionate. If you set up an LLC for a rental property 30 years ago and never closed it then you’re on the hook for this filing. If you had a business in an LLC or Corporation and sold the business but never closed the entity then you’re on the hook for this filing.

Most concerning is that the Egmont Group is based in Canada. Every FIU, including FinCEN, sits under a separate entity under Canadian jurisdiction. Does anyone really trust Justin Trudeau’s Canada and his unelected bureaucracy any more than they trust the unelected bureaucracy in America? Here is a list of the Egmont groups’ affiliate organizations: Vice President Kamala Harris wants to tout her “Opportunity Agenda” and her support of small businesses, yet her administration, of which she is the sitting Vice President, is moving at lightning speed to regulate and criminalize millions of small business owners in the United States. This includes massive fines and up to 2 years in federal prison.. The CTA is a clear violation of the 4th amendment, the 5th amendment and the 10th amendment. State Attorney General’s need to weigh in, urgently. Entity creation and registration has always been a States’ right issue. This is the largest first step the United States has ever taken towards nationalizing private business ownership under a federal umbrella. So what if you decide you want to close your business and not be forced to hand over your personal data to this terrorism and intelligence database? According to FinCEN, enforcement is retroactive. As long as you operated a small business for even one day in 2024, you are still required to self-report, even though you no longer own that business or it has been dissolved. Again, your failure to do so could land you in prison. The Corporate Transparency Act is not about “transparency” or “compliance”, it is about “control”. Unfortunately, without more citizen engagement, and without this being a front and center campaign issue, it seems that little will be done to stop this massive government overreach.

This includes massive fines and up to 2 years in federal prison.. The CTA is a clear violation of the 4th amendment, the 5th amendment and the 10th amendment. State Attorney General’s need to weigh in, urgently. Entity creation and registration has always been a States’ right issue.

So what if you decide you want to close your business and not be forced to hand over your personal data to this terrorism and intelligence database? According to FinCEN, enforcement is retroactive. As long as you operated a small business for even one day in 2024, you are still required to self-report, even though you no longer own that business or it has been dissolved.

Unfortunately, without more citizen engagement, and without this being a front and center campaign issue, it seems that little will be done to stop this massive government overreach. If the legacy media won’t cover this then the alternative media like The Gateway Pundit, and citizen journalists will. Our government is even more fascist than I thought. The Leftist hatred of corporations allows Democrats to punish them however they want, but also redefine any business as a “corporation”. This gives them the leverage to enact Soviet-style persecution of kulaks. I’ve been making phone calls to clients all week about this and the process will continue at least through next week. This reporting requirement is one of the most egregious abuses of government power I have ever witnessed and it’s a direct violation of the 4th Amendment. Trump vetoed the original bill but congress overrode the veto which means that REPUBLICANS supported this crap in sufficient numbers to get it through. A federal judge determined that the reporting was unconstitutional but his injunction ONLY applied to the parties to the case. The fines for this thing are extortionate. If you set up an LLC for a rental property 30 years ago and never closed it then you’re on the hook for this filing. If you had a business in an LLC or Corporation and sold the business but never closed the entity then you’re on the hook for this filing. If you were on an LLC filing for an ex-spouse that never closed the entity you’re on the hook for this even if you separated a decade ago. It’s insanity. I file yearly, and so have a somewhat informed view. If one reads the "rules," screwing up on paperwork alone allows them to confiscate much. This is indeed corrupt fascism by stealth. I file yearly, and so have a somewhat informed view. If one reads the "rules," screwing up on paperwork alone allows them to confiscate much. This is indeed corrupt fascism by stealth. This will not survive a Trump second term. It is gross government overreach and is most probably unconstitutional. Treat it accordingly. The lawsuits have already begun. Doesn’t every small business owner have to report this info. to IRS anyway? It looks like this is just another law to trip up small businesses who can’t possibly keep up with all the laws and regs anymore, anyway. Probably unconstitutional??? Absolutely is. Do businessmen have the intestinal fortitude to stand against it? Tighten belts and SHUT DOWN in mass until they back off... Let the customers scream at them. No they don’t... There is that ONE PENNY they might lose... Big corporations play the fascist game, but small businesses cannot be controlled. Small businesses are owned and managed by "the people."This is why they hate Trump. He is not part of the system. Though he is wealthy, he is independent and the Deep State couldn't control him.

Title: Honeywell (HON) Leading Quantum Computing with Quantinuum

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Best Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Honeywell (NASDAQ:HON) stands against other best quantum computing stocks to buy according to analysts. The modern digital world is built with its transistor-based chips on the foundations of Quantum Mechanics, the physics governing the world at the fundamental level. However, the world has barely scratched the surface when it comes to the full potential of Quantum Mechanics, that is, until Quantum computing came to the foray. In the same spirit but in different light to its classical counterpart, quantum-computing technology seeks to exploit particle superpositions for computing operations. It differs from classical computing due to the particle superpositions that occur at the quantum scale, allowing a qubit to be in a state of both 0 and 1 until it interacts with the environment. This exploit would allow Quantum computers to outperform classical computers exponentially in certain computing tasks. This could have huge implications for healthcare, finance, telecom, and energy industries, among others, ushering the world in a new era of accelerated economic growth. Mckinsey estimates that an economic value of $0.9 – $2 trillion can be extracted by 2035 across four industries – chemicals, life sciences, finance and mobility – due to quantum computing. The McKinsey report estimates the Quantum computing market size to be between $45 billion to $131 billion by 2040. Precedence Research appears more conservative and probably more grounded (You’ll see why). According to their report, the market for quantum computing is around $1 billion as of this year and is projected to expand at a CAGR of 30.9% from 2024 to 2034, reaching a size of $16 billion by the end of the forecast period. The US is expected to comprise $7 billion of the projected quantum market pie by the end of 2034. The market in the US is expected to grow at a CAGR of 31.2% from 2024-2034. As of 2023, North America unsurprisingly comprises 61% of the quantum-computing market. As we point out in a similar article from May, analyzing the quantum-computing equity market based on an ETF exposed to it is a bit tricky. Very few companies have core business related to quantum computing and most companies in these ETFs have peripheral Quantum computing projects but are big and high-performing in other industries that are core to their business, so an ETF’s performance wouldn’t be saying much about the quantum computing industry. Therefore, we’ll delve a little deeper to see what actual challenges there are in the industry and whether they can be practically solved for the delivery of a return on investment as far as scalable practical use cases go. Solving Quantum computing is akin to a Herculean labor. It’s hard to argue with the laws of physics, and when it comes to Quantum computing, a major problem yet to be overcome is Decoherence-induced errors. Decoherence is the enabler of transition from Quantum physics to the everyday physics we experience. Qubits (the quantum equivalent of bits) can only remain in a superposition as long as there’s no interaction with the environment. Even the slightest interaction causes them to decohere to classical bits, introducing computing errors. The hard part is to keep them in a superposition long enough for quantum computation to be viable. Further, to scale quantum computing, you have to add more qubits to the system, but adding more qubits, in principle, increases the probability of error. Finally, any approaches to error correction must obey the Quantum no-cloning theorem, which makes these approaches inherently more challenging than their classical counterparts. In 2022, Azure Quantum demonstrated the soundness of physics required to build topological qubits (these qubits are different in that they can maintain coherence for longer and would thereby lead to a reduced error rate through more stability). On the other hand, Researchers at Quantum AI, an arm of another big tech company, made a breakthrough in 2023, demonstrating a reduced error rate even with an increased number of traditional Qubits. However, rare correlated error events that happened roughly every hour limited the exceptionally low error rate required for practical quantum computing, with more research required to tackle them. Despite these steps, the challenges remain to be effectively overcome. It’s anyone’s guess how long it’ll take for quantum computers to scale and become economically viable. If the amount of capital being invested by venture capital firms in the industry is any guide, it certainly doesn’t look good for the industry as of recent. According to IQM’s State-of-Quantum Report of 2024, the venture capital invested in Quantum startups dropped by 50% worldwide in 2023 compared to the year prior, with the US quantum startup ecosystem seeing the greatest decline of capital at 80%. As far as public equity in the quantum computing industry goes, it is overall yet to be profitable. The industry hasn’t experienced any operating leverage in any meaningful sense and is focused on growing revenue in its early stage. The hard problems with regards to practicality and scalability has resulted in many quantum computing stocks trade at price levels that make them non-compliant with stock exchanges, resulting in delisting threats by stock exchanges. Also read why Jim Cramer can’t recommend a particular quantum computing stock here. For our list, we’ve selected companies that have a presence in the quantum computing industry and ranked them on the basis of their 12-month price upside on analysts’ consensus. Please note that we have used the median upside because average upsides can be greatly affected by outlier analysts on either side of the low or high. For some stocks, both mean and median upsides were too low, but since we wanted to limit our list to pure-play stocks as much as we could, we chose them using the high end of the upside, provided that at least 9 analysts had contributed to their average upside. Finally, we ranked the stocks on weighted scores, with median upside having a weight of 0.4 while analyst count having a weight of 0.6. For stocks for which we have used high-end of the upside, the weight for the upside is 0.2, with analyst-count weight reduced to 0.4. For stocks whose upside is based on only one analyst, and if the upside is over 30%, we assigned weights of 0.01 to both the upside and the analyst count. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

A shot of a commercial plane with a blur of color in the background, representing the production of auxiliary power units in the Safety and Productivity Solutions segment. High Upside Potential: 9.74% Number of Analysts: 9 Insider Monkey Weighted Score: 5.5 Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON) is a conglomerate headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina. The company operates in several industries like aerospace, energy, logistics, technology and healthcare, among others. The conglomerate operates in the quantum computing industry through its company Quantinuum, which was formed after the merger of Honeywell Quantum Solutions and Cambrige Quantum. Among Quantinuum’s quantum partners are Airbus and BMW Group. In quantum, the company is known for ion-trapped qubits that it claims are easier to manufacture and control. The advantages offered by the approach are high fidelity and long coherence times. Compared to other technologies like superconducting qubits, trapped ions have shown better error rates. In January 2024, Honeywell (NASDAQ:HON) raised $300 million for Quantinuum, bringing the company’s valuation to $5 billion. This funding round, led by partners like JPMorgan Chase, has boosted investor confidence in Honeywell’s quantum initiatives. According to reports, Honeywell is considering an IPO for Quantinuum as early as 2025 and is reportedly looking for a valuation of $10 billion for its subsidiary. In its 2030 roadmap, the company said it would have a working universal quantum computer it calls Apollo by the end of the decade. A total of 9 analysts have rated the stock, and although the median upside is -3.31%, we ranked it on its upside from the high end, which stands at 9.74%. Overall, HON ranks 10th on our list of best quantum computing stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of HON as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than HON but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.
