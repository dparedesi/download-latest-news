Title: Brazil’s President Confronts a Changing World

Not long ago, President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva met me in his office in Brasília and told me that he’d had a disturbing dream. In recent months, Lula had turned seventy-nine and undergone emergency surgery for a brain hemorrhage, and although he seemed fit and healthy when we met, he was in a reflective mood. He’d dreamed the night before about his predecessor José Sarney, who is now ninety-four years old. Sarney is a cherished figure in Brazil: in the nineteen-eighties, he became the country’s first President to take office after two decades of military rule. “In my dream, he came to my house and slept on the floor, and in the morning I made him breakfast,” Lula said. “I woke up worried, wondering if something had happened to him during the night.” The LedeReporting and commentary on what you need to know today. Sarney turned out to be fine, but it is no accident that Lula was concerned about an emblem of democracy. He told me that the entire Western system felt imperilled. “The democracy we learned to live with after World War Two, the functioning of multilateralism as an important role in relations between states, the respect for diversity, the sovereignty of each country is now fading,” he said. “What comes next, we don’t know.” The entire post-Second World War order, created largely through the intervention of the United States, seemed on the verge of collapse. “We thought we were creating a more civilized, more solidarity-based, more humane society,” he said. “The result is worse. It’s as if there is a lamp, and when you open the lid the evil people come out.” Lula has built a career on unwavering leftist principles, but he has also long prided himself on his ability to get along with a variety of leaders. Now, though, he confessed that he was flummoxed by the right-wing populists and anti-globalists gaining power around the world. At the United Nations General Assembly last September, he’d tried to organize a meeting of progressive Presidents. “When we sat down to make the list, I discovered there were no more progressives!” he said. In Latin America, only a small group of left-leaning leaders remains, including Gustavo Petro, of Colombia, Gabriel Boric, of Chile, and Claudia Sheinbaum, of Mexico. “In order to keep the meeting from being too small, I changed ‘progressives’ to ‘democrats,’ so I could invite Biden, Macron, and other people,” Lula explained. “We’ve had two meetings since then, to discuss how to create a narrative to justify the importance of the democratic system as the best thing ever created for humanity’s coexistence—a system with rules, where everyone has rights, and someone’s rights end when they infringe on the rights of others. It’s what worked in the world. Monarchies, empires—they didn’t work. Nazism didn’t work. Stalin’s communism didn’t work.” In his country and in the U.S., he suggested, large portions of the populace seemed to have lost their grip on reality. “There are people who believe things that everyone should understand are lies, because they are so absurd,” he told me. “And my concern is how we are going to build a narrative to destroy this.” The troubling thing, he said, is that “we still don’t have an answer.” Part of the problem was economic, he said. “Democracy starts to fall when it no longer meets the people’s interests. Since 1980, the working people in countries that built welfare states have only lost, while income concentration has increased. So what response can we give to Brazilian society? And to German and American society?” There was also a question of leadership. “The U.S. was the mirror of democracy, the pillar of democracy for the planet,” he said. “Despite being the country that wages the most wars, it’s the country that talks the most about peace, the most about democracy. And yet now there is Trump, who sometimes behaves like—” Lula stopped himself, then continued. “I saw a speech of his in the U.S. Congress recently, and it was absurd—those Republicans clapping at whatever nonsense he said. It was almost the same kind of speech that anarchists used to make in Italy and Brazil at the beginning of the century, calling for a society without institutions, a society where the empire of capital rules.” President Donald Trump made clear his interventionist intentions toward Latin America as soon as he resumed office; in his Inaugural Address, he vowed to “retake” the Panama Canal. Since then, most leaders in the region have handled Washington with elaborate care. The right-wing populists strained to display their loyalty and affinity. Javier Milei—a hard-line libertarian who has slashed away half of Argentina’s government ministries—gave Elon Musk an engraved chainsaw and hailed Trump as “one of the two most relevant politicians on planet Earth.” (The other, of course, being Milei.) He has been rewarded with U.S. support for a twenty-billion-dollar International Monetary Fund loan, and with praise from Trump, who has said that Milei is doing “a fantastic job.” In El Salvador, President Nayib Bukele offered to allow the U.S. to deport its undesirable migrants to his country, to be held in an appalling hellhole of a prison. When Bukele recently visited the Oval Office, he and Trump traded smug jokes about their arrangement, with Trump saying that he’d like to send “homegrowns,” too, and Bukele scoffing at the suggestion that he would return the wrongly deported migrant Kilmar Abrego Garcia to the U.S. Among the region’s leftist leaders, Colombia’s Petro was the first to resist Trump. After refusing to permit U.S. military planes carrying deportees to land in Colombia, he suggested on social media that Trump was a “white slaveowner,” while comparing himself to Colonel Aureliano Buendía, the doomed hero of “One Hundred Years of Solitude.” Trump retaliated by announcing punishing tariffs and a sweeping prohibition on U.S. visas for Colombian officials. Within hours, Petro had relented, and his humiliation provided an object lesson for other leaders. In March, a Hong Kong-based company named CK Hutchison Holdings agreed to sell its ports on the Panama Canal to a consortium led by the American investment company BlackRock. Trump quickly claimed that he was effectively reasserting control over the canal. Panama’s President, José Raúl Mulino, tried to salvage his dignity with defiant public statements, but he has mostly succumbed to pressure from D.C. Last month, Panama and the U.S. signed an expanded security-coöperation agreement that allows American armed forces to occupy several former military bases along the Canal Zone. In a joint statement on the new security relationship, released during a visit by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, a sentence acknowledging U.S. respect for Panama’s sovereignty was pointedly excluded from the English-language version. Panamanians have grown frustrated. An influential friend there wrote to me, “Mulino has not stopped giving his ass to Trump at every turn, in exchange for nothing.” Mexico’s President, Claudia Sheinbaum, has made more convincing displays of composure, but she, too, has avoided confrontations with Trump by giving him what he wants. As my colleague Stephania Taladrid detailed recently, these efforts have included stepping up Mexico’s security presence at the border, handing over high-level narco-traffickers to the U.S., and significantly increasing seizures of fentanyl. Even Venezuela’s would-be revolutionary leader, President Nicolás Maduro, congratulated Trump for returning to the White House and agreed to hand over American prisoners from his country’s jails. After the Trump Administration deported hundreds of alleged Venezuelan gang members to Bukele’s prison, Maduro issued a statement denouncing the action as “fascism”—but he was careful to address it to Bukele directly, rather than to Trump. Lula and Chile’s Boric have been the most outspoken Latin American leaders. On a recent state visit to India, Boric described Trump’s Inauguration, with Big Tech billionaires “paying fealty to a new wannabe emperor,” as reminiscent of “something from another era.” He criticized the tariffs as “irrational” and “unsustainable.” Although his country’s main export commodity, copper, had so far been exempted, Boric promised to seek out new trade deals with India, Japan, and others. He warned that if Trump did place tariffs on Chile’s copper—eleven per cent of which went to the U.S. last year—the higher cost would ultimately be passed on to American consumers. “The law of the strongest has short legs,” he said. Lula knows that his coalition is thin. In a recent speech, he said, “The Presidents of South American countries should understand that we are very weak if we are isolated.” When I saw him in Brasília, he made a plea for greater international coöperation. “We have to convince the world that it’s not possible to end multilateralism,” he said. “Multilateralism was a form of civility found among states to coexist peacefully, with rules that everyone must follow,” he went on. “It’s already proven that, if we don’t control the air, everyone will be a victim of air pollution. If the sea rises, everyone will be a victim. It hasn’t yet reached the world’s most important leaders that we need global governance to make some decisions globally.” Lula noted that the environment was among the most pressing global issues, but he also acknowledged the limits of multilateralism in dealing with it. This year, Brazil will host the COP30 climate conference, in the city of Belém—a location, at the edge of the Amazon, chosen to bring attention to the crisis of deforestation. Yet it is hard to imagine that it will bring radical change. European countries in particular seem likely to donate less as they scramble to devote more of their budgets to military expenditures. Lula shrugged this off. “I do not believe in money from developed countries,” he said. “They promised a hundred billion dollars in 2009, and they have not yet delivered. It has been sixteen years. Now the need is 1.3 trillion dollars—and they will not deliver.” Lula advocated a world in which the major powers could compete without resorting to warfare, and in which they coöperated more closely on such priorities as hunger and climate change. It was not lost on him that Brazil, as a developing economy, depends on maintaining friendly relations, even when it means partnering with countries with wildly divergent value systems. “We need to say: thank goodness we have China that, from a technological perspective, is very advanced and can compete in the technological world of A.I., giving us an alternative for this debate,” he said. In his telling, Western powers’ animosity toward China was spurred by trade, not by its human-rights abuses or its threats to invade Taiwan. “I am from a generation that learned in the nineteen-eighties, through Reagan and Margaret Thatcher, that the best thing for the world was globalization and free trade. Products should flow freely across the world. Money should flow freely across the world.” China, he said, had merely adopted this theory along with everyone else. “China started producing everything that was produced in the U.S. and Europe. You couldn’t buy a single pair of pants, shoes, or a shirt that didn’t say ‘Made in China.’ They very skillfully copied everything and learned how to produce things as well or better. Now that the Chinese have become competitive, they have become the world’s enemies,” he added testily. “And we don’t accept that. We don’t accept the idea of a second Cold War. We accept the idea that the more similar countries are—technologically and militarily advanced—the more they must talk to each other, because I’m not sure the planet can handle a Third World War.” Lula insists on pacifism in an idealistic way that is unusual among world leaders. “Last year, the world spent $2.4 trillion on weapons, while seven hundred and thirty million people go to sleep every night not knowing if they’ll have breakfast when they wake up,” he said. “That should be humanity’s main concern.” Even after Russia invaded Ukraine, he resisted taking sides. He described a recent meeting with the German Chancellor: “My friend Olaf Scholz came here, sat on that couch, and asked Brazil to sell missiles to him so he could send them to Ukraine. I told him I wouldn’t sell, with all due respect, because I didn’t want any Ukrainian or Russian to die with a Brazilian weapon.” Like some others on the left (and many on the right), he criticized the U.S. and Europe for funding efforts to confront Putin in Ukraine. “When you corner the enemy, you need to have the strength to defeat that enemy, and it’s not easy to defeat Russia,” Lula said. “I discussed this with Biden. And Biden kept saying, ‘We’re going to destroy Putin, and he’ll have to rebuild Ukraine.’ What’s going to happen now? If peace happens, organized by Trump, he will win the Nobel Peace Prize, and Europe will have to pay for NATO, will have to finance the war, and will have to rebuild Ukraine.” A few weeks earlier, Lula had urged Russia to halt the war. “I called Putin and I said, ‘Putin, I think it’s time for you to return to politics. Put an end to this. The world needs politics, not war. You’re missed. There are not enough people to sit around the table and discuss the fate of the planet: What do we want for humanity?’ ” Lula ridiculed Trump’s desire to take over Greenland and Canada. “The only thing left for him to take over is Antarctica,” he said. “Why do Russia and the U.S. want to increase their territories if they can’t even manage what they already have?” In his view, the global posturing by Trump, Vice-President J. D. Vance, and Musk was a serious threat. “They are deniers of the institutions that guarantee democracy worldwide,” he said. “The fact that the U.S. Vice-President interferes in Germany’s politics is already a crime. I have never gone to another country to interfere in an election!” He suggested that the bellicose rhetoric would eventually harm them. “At first, it may look good,” he said. “But the result could be much worse than what they are criticizing. When you release a wild beast, afterward you don’t know how to control it.” Not long before we talked, the U.S. government had announced a twenty-five-per-cent tariff on Brazilian steel. “There will be reciprocity,” Lula said. “But, before there is reciprocity, we want to show the U.S. what two hundred years of diplomatic and commercial relations between Brazil and the U.S. represents.” He pointed out that the U.S. had a seven-billion-dollar trade surplus with Brazil last year, the steel imports included. “What the U.S. imports from Brazil, they transform and then export back to Brazil,” he said. “It’s a two-way street, so I think this will be harmful to the U.S. For our part, we want to negotiate diplomatically. If there’s no possibility, we will take action.” When I asked Lula if Trump had reached out to him, he said no. “If, as a representative of the American state, he wants to talk to Lula, the representative of the Brazilian state, I will talk to him calmly,” he said. “But so far I haven’t had any interest in talking to him, either. If I ever have a problem and need to call him, I will call him.” ♦

Title: BlackRock reveals $32 million Q1 revenue from Bitcoin IBIT ETF in new SEC filing

IBIT’s quarterly disclosure highlights inflows despite Bitcoin’s 11.15% price drop and evolving custody framework. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. It’s been a big quarter for BlackRock’s Shares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) with new custodians, Bitcoin volatility, a new regulatory landscape, and a pro-Bitcoin president. In its latest quarterly filing, BlackRock reported $47.78 billion in net assets at the end of Q1 2025, a decrease from $51.52 billion in the previous quarter. This decline tracks Bitcoin’s 11.15% price fall during the same period, affirming the ETF’s direct correlation to Bitcoin market performance. While Bitcoin’s price retreat impacted net asset value (NAV), the Trust’s underlying demand remained intact. Share issuances outpaced redemptions by 43 million during the quarter. The total number of outstanding shares reached 1.013 billion, reflecting sustained institutional interest despite market volatility. The NAV per share fell to $47.14 from $53.09. The largest NAV point during Q1 was $60.61 on January 21, with the lowest at $44.62 on March 10. However, as of press time, IBIT is trading at $56 in pre-market as Bitcoin attempts to reclaim $100,000. Operational costs during the quarter were modest relative to asset size. Sponsor fees totaled $33.04 million. BlackRock’s promotional fee waiver for the first $5 billion in AUM at a reduced rate of 0.12% cost the Trust $178,082 during the quarter, though this concession expired in January 2025. Coinbase Custody remained the Trust’s primary Bitcoin custodian. However, BlackRock expanded its custody framework in April 2025, appointing Anchorage Digital Bank under a new custodial services agreement. The move is to add redundancy to safeguard against counterparty and operational risks, especially as Coinbase has faced regulatory challenges. Notably, the SEC’s lawsuit against Coinbase was dismissed in February 2025, which removed near-term legal uncertainty around the Trust’s key service provider. Market structure risks also surfaced throughout the filing. BlackRock detailed that Bitcoin sold to fund share redemptions resulted in $624 million in realized gains, evidencing the Trust’s liquidity efficiency. Nevertheless, the document extensively outlined regulatory and security vulnerabilities, including exposure to custody losses, market manipulation, and global regulatory shifts. U.S. initiatives such as President Trump’s March 2025 executive order creating a “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve” and pending congressional legislation to acquire 1 million Bitcoin over five years were noted as potential market catalysts and risks. The Trust’s custodial and counterparty arrangements are subject to liability limitations. Insurance policies maintained by Coinbase and Anchorage may be insufficient to cover extreme loss scenarios. Lastly, the ETF’s exposure to ongoing regulatory evolution remains central. The filing cited rising scrutiny from U.S. and global authorities, including FinCEN’s proposed rules on digital asset mixers and OFAC’s ongoing enforcement, as factors that could affect liquidity and market access. Ultimately, IBIT’s quarterly disclosure highlights a balance between robust inflows and market-related NAV compression, while offering an extensive view into how BlackRock manages structural, regulatory, and operational risks in the digital asset landscape.

Title: Bitcoin defies doubts at $98K, so why are investors still cautious?

BTC surges amid hopeful ETF inflows, but the market is still on edge. Despite Bitcoin’s [BTC] impressive hold above the $98K mark, investor sentiment has taken a sharp turn lower. This brings along a wave of doubt that feels oddly out of place in a bull market. Is the market caught in disbelief, priming for a euphoric breakout? Or do these signals mirror the 2022 bear market? With BTC’s recent surge reigniting momentum, the current climate may be driven as much by psychology as by fundamentals. Recent data revealed a striking divergence between Bitcoin’s price and prevailing sentiment on X (formerly Twitter) and news platforms. Even with BTC trading confidently above $98K, the 7-day average sentiment remained firmly negative – a pattern historically associated with local bottoms and contrarian buying opportunities. Source: Alphractal This persistent disbelief suggests that the market is psychologically lagging behind price action. While such sentiment drops have previously preceded bullish reversals, it’s worth remembering the cautionary tale of 2022, where extended negativity coincided with a prolonged bear phase. A sharp shift is visible on the ETF flow chart: after weeks of consistent outflows, April ushered in a regime of substantial spot ETF inflows. This renewed institutional interest, primarily led by giants like BlackRock and Fidelity, appears to have reignited Bitcoin’s upward momentum, pushing it past the $98K mark. Source: Glassnode Unlike the volatile flows of earlier months, this phase shows steady daily net inflows, signaling strong long-term conviction. Institutional confidence may be the key force behind the surge, even as retail sentiment remains cautious. While ETF inflows signal optimism, history reminds investors to stay cautious. In 2022, bullish sentiment, driven by institutional products and macro trends, collapsed due to liquidity shocks and excess leverage. A sudden shift in risk appetite or regulatory pressures could trigger rapid outflows, reversing recent gains. Although ETFs offer transparency, they don’t shield Bitcoin from market volatility. If inflows slow or turn to redemptions, Bitcoin could face sell-offs similar to past cycles.

Title: Bitcoin network activity drops to bear market levels – Red flag or buy signal?

Time Published: 2025-05-08T00:00:28Z

Bitcoin’s low volatility and institutional support hint at potential growth despite bearish signals. Bitcoin [BTC] network activity has dropped to bear market levels since December 2024, as the Network Activity Index has sharply declined. This indicates a slowdown in transaction activity and a decrease in daily active addresses, signaling lower demand for block space. While this pattern is typical during bear markets or specific events like the China ban in 2021, it may not necessarily be a red flag. While the market may appear weak, the influx of institutional confidence may help stabilize BTC in the long term. At press time, Bitcoin was trading at $96,998.87, reflecting a 2.91% increase over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin’s volatility has decreased to 25.80%, its lowest level in the past thirty days. This period of low volatility could suggest that the market is experiencing a temporary calm before any significant price movements. Historically, such periods of low volatility are often followed by sudden price shifts, whether upward or downward. Given the recent price increase, the market may be preparing for another volatile phase, especially with the upcoming FOMC meeting potentially influencing broader market sentiment. Source: IntoTheBlock At the time of writing, BTC was testing key resistance at $98K, with Fibonacci retracement levels indicating critical price action. The 0.236 and 0.382 retracement levels at $95,656 and $96,347 are key areas of interest, while the 50% and 61.8% levels at $94,799 and $92,171 provide potential support zones. The Stochastic RSI was at 41.55, signaling neutral conditions, with room for both upward and downward movement. A successful breakout above $98K would likely target the $100K mark, but failure to breach this level could lead to a pullback, making $90K and $92K the key support zones. Source: TradingView Bitcoin ETF inflows have been robust, with a total of $5.13 billion entering BTC ETF products over the last three weeks. These inflows signal strong institutional confidence in Bitcoin, even as retail activity slows. However, the upcoming FOMC meeting could introduce market volatility, as any adjustments in interest rates or commentary from the Federal Reserve could impact investor sentiment. Despite this uncertainty, the inflows into BTC ETFs suggest that institutional investors remain optimistic about Bitcoin’s long-term potential. Source: Santiment Whale activity has surged recently, with institutional investors like BlackRock purchasing 280 BTC worth $37.8 million and Metaplanet adding 555 BTC. These purchases indicate that large holders are betting on Bitcoin’s future growth, and their actions could signal confidence in the asset, even amid uncertain market conditions. Despite bear market signals, BTC’s price action, along with institutional inflows and whale activity, suggests potential growth. With low volatility, major resistance at $98K, and institutional confidence rising, BTC may be gearing up for another upward move. However, the market’s direction will depend on BTC’s response to key price levels and the upcoming FOMC meeting, which could impact investor sentiment.

Title: Parents concerned as embattled childcare provider Genius still without buyer

Search the news, stories & people Personalise the news and stay in the know Emergency Backstory Newsletters 中文新闻 BERITA BAHASA INDONESIA TOK PISIN Topic:Child Care As troubled childcare provider Genius continues to battle financial woes, the future of its childcare centres remain in limbo. (ABC News: Lucas Hill) The future for staff and children at Genius childcare centres remains in doubt as the financially stricken company searches for new buyers. Administrators are still processing hundreds of enquiries from potential buyers, in an attempt to recoup huge debts owed. Genius remains embroiled in several legal battles over allegation over unpaid rent and wages. The fate of childcare centres looking after more than 1,100 children remains uncertain after administrators warned they may have to shut them down if they can't find a buyer. Centres run by the stricken Genius childcare empire are on the market after they were taken over by administrators, WLP Restructuring, in March following years of accusations by workers of wage underpayment and financial mismanagement. In an affidavit filed with the Federal Court last month, the administrators said they had already closed eight of 18 centres that two Genius companies operated when they collapsed, despite getting a $1 million cash injection from funder Finexia to keep trading. They warned they may have to close the remaining centres, leaving the children without daycare and tipping more than 200 workers out of their jobs, if they can't find a buyer. Centres may be forced to close, leaving hundreds of children without daycare. (ABC Kimberley: Ted O'Connor) Parent Kahri D'Este, whose two children are enrolled at a Genius centre in Conder in the ACT, said she is holding out hope that the centre stays open. "If it goes under — which I honestly think is highly likely — then we will have no care," she said. "We don't have any other option, it's not easy to get care here, everywhere has a waiting list for months." Ms D'Este said despite the ongoing threat of the centre suddenly shutting down, the "amazing staff" have kept her from walking away. "I cannot believe that the educators, who have stuck through it this whole way, could just be dropped like hot potatoes," she said. "There are so many good staff here, and they work their butts off, and they have been treated so badly." The administrators had intended to secure a new buyer by last week, but were still processing more than 400 enquiries from interested parties. The sale of the centres is intended to recoup the huge debts owed by companies in the Genius group, which currently stand at as much as $88 million and are forecast to grow as more creditors emerge. Potential buyers include Gold Coast-based Finexia, where Genius owner Darren Misquitta was until recently the biggest shareholder, but which has become embroiled in Genius's financial downfall. ASX-listed Finexia was forced to freeze its childcare fund in February and last month revealed to investors that more than a fifth of the fund's money was tied up in loans that were in default. Minutes from administrators' meetings with creditors reveal Finexia is chasing Genius over a loan worth more than $24 million, but Finexia has not formally informed investors of the dollar value of its loans to Genius. Finexia offers loans to childcare providers, and has provided funding to Genius. (Finexia) However, it has told the market of the sudden resignation of interim chief executive Marc Duncan last week, who had been at the helm since February when Executive Director and chief executive Patrick Bell left without warning after four years. The company is currently suspended from the exchange. Executive chairman Neil Sheather did not answer questions about Finexia's transactions with Genius. He told the ABC a company run by Mr Misquitta, Sprint Capital Partners, became Finexia's biggest shareholder in 2023 after a capital raising. Finexia's 2023 annual report shows Sprint owned 11.4 per cent of the company. But Mr Sheather said Sprint divested the holding after Finexia raised concerns about a potential conflict of interest. "What became clear to us at Finexia was that this was not the relationship we wanted," he said. Another potential buyer is Steps Early Learning, which has for months been poised to take over ten Genius centres. Steps, which is run by Mr Misquitta's former business partner Ashok Naveinthiran, had in April not yet received the critical provider approval required by ACECQA to be authorised to run childcare centres. Despite that, administrators said they had received more than $278,600 in childcare subsidies Steps had been paid since March. In the meantime, administrators are also investigating a string of transactions made by Genius companies' bank accounts, including transfers made in the days immediately before the administrators were appointed along with "payments to or at the direction of Mr Misquitta" and "payments to other third parties of at least $500,000". According to the affidavit, the results of those investigations will help determine whether Mr Misquitta contravened his director duties and allowed the companies to trade while insolvent. Genius Childcare owner Darren Misquitta remains at the centre of an investigation launched by administrators. (LinkedIn) Separately, an interim report by a different administrator responsible for a third Genius company known as Horizontal 1 Pty Ltd, said initial investigations suggested the company had not been able to pay its debts since as early as June 30, 2020. Genius is also embroiled in a legal stoush with global fund management giant Blackrock, with the company taking action in the Federal Court in November 2024 over more than $1.2 million in unpaid rent. The same month, the United Workers Union launched proceedings against Genius companies and Mr Misquitta claiming underpayment of superannuation and failure to pay wages to workers on time. That case has been temporarily paused pending the administration process. Mr Misquitta did not respond to the ABC's questions.

Title: Mark Carney’s Sustainability Goals Could Reshape Canadian Real Estate
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/alihoss/2025/05/07/mark-carneys-sustainability-goals-could-reshape-canadian-real-estate/
Time Published: 2025-05-07T16:31:18Z
Full Content:
ByAli Hoss ByAli Hoss, Contributor. Could Carney's Climate Strategies Provide Competitive advantages in Canada's commercial Real Estate? Canada stands at a pivotal juncture in its sustainability journey, marked by the recent emergence of Prime Minister Mark Carney. As the nation transitions from traditional carbon taxation to a nuanced incentive-based climate strategy, commercial real estate stakeholders must carefully consider the implications of these substantial policy shifts. Carney’s ambitious plans present both considerable opportunities and complex challenges for the Canadian commercial property sector. This transition is further accentuated by evolving sustainability standards across Canada, driven by the urgent imperative to reposition soon-to-be stranded assets. Stakeholders must thoughtfully navigate these interconnected dynamics, capitalizing on emerging incentives and adapting proactively to maintain competitiveness and resilience. Canada’s evolving sustainability strategy under Carney’s leadership will undoubtedly impact the commercial real estate sector. It looks like 2025 marks the beginning of a new regulatory landscape. Historically, Canada’s approach to climate change mitigation and adaptation centered heavily on a consumer-facing carbon tax, designed to incentivize sustainable choices through direct financial costs. However, Carney’s administration has significantly shifted this approach, eliminating consumer carbon pricing in favor of targeted incentives and enhanced industrial regulation. Carney’s strategy retains carbon pricing mechanisms for large industrial emitters, thus continuing to leverage regulatory pressures effectively within heavy industries. Canada’s new policy notably emphasizes the importance of maintaining the nation’s global competitiveness through the introduction of a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism. This tariff not only discourages companies from relocating to countries with weaker climate regulations, but also equalizes costs associated with carbon-intensive production. This allows businesses in countries committed to ambitious climate targets to remain competitive internationally. For commercial real estate owners and operators, this raises intriguing questions: How might these industrial regulations indirectly influence property investment markets, particularly in regions heavily dependent on manufacturing, logistics, or resource extraction? Could CBAM indirectly alter property values or tenant demand patterns, compelling developers and investors to reassess site location, procurement strategies, and performance benchmarks? The results remain to be seen. Carney’s climate initiatives are also focused on incentives for the adoption of sustainable technologies, including a 31% credit rate for eligible properties acquired after January 1, 2024. The additional expansion of subsidies for electric vehicles, heat pumps, efficiency retrofits, and renewable energy installations promises to accelerate Canada’s transition to a low-carbon economy. These subsidies offer the commercial real estate sector tangible financial incentives to integrate cutting-edge sustainability technologies into building design and operations. Furthermore, direct government support, such as Canada Infrastructure Bank’s Building Retrofits Initiative, will likely create favorable conditions for developers investing in sustainable construction and retrofits. Carney’s administration has explicitly committed to accelerating project approvals, such as a $175 million investment in the Hudson Bay Railway and the Port of Churchill, especially projects related to critical minerals and clean-energy infrastructure. We should also take into account the Building Emission Performance Standards, which set explicit emissions performance benchmarks for commercial buildings, incentivizing efficiency upgrades, renewable energy integration, and electrification. However, BEPS implementation poses challenges as well, especially regarding upfront retrofit costs. Cities like Vancouver address affordability concerns through targeted financial incentives and technical assistance programs, ensuring equitable compliance pathways for diverse stakeholders. Although solutions will vary across provinces, the nation-wide policy direction raises questions about whether proactive engagement in sustainability initiatives will led to competitive advantages in tenant attraction, operational cost management, or long-term asset valuation. The nonprofit Green Communities Canada released a report in April 2025 projecting that eco-friendly retrofits could save Canadians $3.8 billion over the next 20 years for at least half a million Canadian households. Perhaps most significantly, Carney’s advocacy for mandatory emissions disclosures, including Scope 3 emissions, and for structured frameworks guiding financial institutions toward sustainable investments, is expected to have widespread across the Canadian economy. His renowned maxim, "What gets measured gets managed," encapsulates his belief in data-driven transparency as a catalyst for environmental action. Real estate finance, inherently reliant on institutional lending and capital markets, stands to experience substantial shifts under these new financial sector guidelines. Mandatory climate risk disclosures could alter investment attractiveness, reshape lending practices, and influence asset valuation methodologies. Regulatory frameworks like Vancouver’s Climate Emergency Action Plan impose stringent emissions caps, substantial fines, and progressive tightening of standards. Buildings failing these benchmarks face diminished financing options, lower valuations, and decreased tenant appeal. In this regulatory landscape, institutional investors increasingly prioritize sustainability performance metrics, suggesting an evolving landscape where properties demonstrating superior environmental credentials will likely command valuation and rent premiums. Moreover, financial institutions and investors increasingly categorize assets failing sustainability standards as high-risk investments. Given the significant economic disruptions accompanying recent tariffs and international trade tensions, substantial stimulus investment in sustainable infrastructure, including commercial real estate, could deliver multifaceted economic benefits. For example, directing governmental funding toward sustainable commercial developments in urban cores might simultaneously stimulate economic recovery and address critical urban housing shortages through mixed-use projects. On the other hand, while Carney’s vision presents substantial opportunities, it also introduces complexities and potential risks. Carney’s historical emphasis on voluntary industry collaboration, such as the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero and Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, underscores a preference for cooperative rather than strictly regulatory frameworks. However, voluntary approaches alone might be insufficient, as their effectiveness can be undermined by subjective interpretations with a high risk of greenwashing. For instance, in recent months, four of Canada’s largest banks have withdrawn from the United Nations-backed Net-Zero Banking Alliance, an initiative specifically designed to accelerate climate action within the financial sector. This trend is mirrored in the U.S., where several major banks and leading asset management firms, such as BlackRock and Vanguard, also stepped away from prominent climate-focused asset manager alliances. These departures highlight the fragility of voluntary climate commitments and reinforce the need for robust, binding policies to promote transparency and accountability. Looking ahead, the shift from consumer carbon taxation toward structured incentives, financial market reforms, and integrated societal solutions positions real estate as a critical player in Canada’s sustainability journey. Carney’s proposed framework underscores the intricate balance between environmental stewardship, economic pragmatism, and social responsibility. For the commercial real estate industry, navigating this new paradigm will require strategic foresight, proactive adaptation, and collaborative engagement with both public and private stakeholders. As Canada embarks upon this ambitious sustainability trajectory, commercial real estate professionals must thoughtfully consider their roles, responsibilities, and opportunities.

Title: Carney’s Sustainability Policy Shift: Canada’s Real Estate Game Changer?

ByAli Hoss ByAli Hoss, Contributor. Could Carney's Climate Strategies Provide Competitive advantages in Canada's commercial Real Estate? Canada stands at a pivotal juncture in its sustainability journey, marked by the recent emergence of Prime Minister Mark Carney. As the nation transitions from traditional carbon taxation to a nuanced incentive-based climate strategy, commercial real estate stakeholders must carefully consider the implications of these substantial policy shifts. Carney’s ambitious plans present both considerable opportunities and complex challenges for the Canadian commercial property sector. This transition is further accentuated by evolving sustainability standards across Canada, driven by the urgent imperative to reposition soon-to-be stranded assets. Stakeholders must thoughtfully navigate these interconnected dynamics, capitalizing on emerging incentives and adapting proactively to maintain competitiveness and resilience. Canada’s evolving sustainability strategy under Carney’s leadership will undoubtedly impact the commercial real estate sector. It looks like 2025 marks the beginning of a new regulatory landscape. Historically, Canada’s approach to climate change mitigation and adaptation centered heavily on a consumer-facing carbon tax, designed to incentivize sustainable choices through direct financial costs. However, Carney’s administration has significantly shifted this approach, eliminating consumer carbon pricing in favor of targeted incentives and enhanced industrial regulation. Carney’s strategy retains carbon pricing mechanisms for large industrial emitters, thus continuing to leverage regulatory pressures effectively within heavy industries. Canada’s new policy notably emphasizes the importance of maintaining the nation’s global competitiveness through the introduction of a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism. This tariff not only discourages companies from relocating to countries with weaker climate regulations, but also equalizes costs associated with carbon-intensive production. This allows businesses in countries committed to ambitious climate targets to remain competitive internationally. For commercial real estate owners and operators, this raises intriguing questions: How might these industrial regulations indirectly influence property investment markets, particularly in regions heavily dependent on manufacturing, logistics, or resource extraction? Could CBAM indirectly alter property values or tenant demand patterns, compelling developers and investors to reassess site location, procurement strategies, and performance benchmarks? The results remain to be seen. Carney’s climate initiatives are also focused on incentives for the adoption of sustainable technologies, including a 31% credit rate for eligible properties acquired after January 1, 2024. The additional expansion of subsidies for electric vehicles, heat pumps, efficiency retrofits, and renewable energy installations promises to accelerate Canada’s transition to a low-carbon economy. These subsidies offer the commercial real estate sector tangible financial incentives to integrate cutting-edge sustainability technologies into building design and operations. Furthermore, direct government support, such as Canada Infrastructure Bank’s Building Retrofits Initiative, will likely create favorable conditions for developers investing in sustainable construction and retrofits. Carney’s administration has explicitly committed to accelerating project approvals, such as a $175 million investment in the Hudson Bay Railway and the Port of Churchill, especially projects related to critical minerals and clean-energy infrastructure. We should also take into account the Building Emission Performance Standards, which set explicit emissions performance benchmarks for commercial buildings, incentivizing efficiency upgrades, renewable energy integration, and electrification. However, BEPS implementation poses challenges as well, especially regarding upfront retrofit costs. Cities like Vancouver address affordability concerns through targeted financial incentives and technical assistance programs, ensuring equitable compliance pathways for diverse stakeholders. Although solutions will vary across provinces, the nation-wide policy direction raises questions about whether proactive engagement in sustainability initiatives will led to competitive advantages in tenant attraction, operational cost management, or long-term asset valuation. The nonprofit Green Communities Canada released a report in April 2025 projecting that eco-friendly retrofits could save Canadians $3.8 billion over the next 20 years for at least half a million Canadian households. Perhaps most significantly, Carney’s advocacy for mandatory emissions disclosures, including Scope 3 emissions, and for structured frameworks guiding financial institutions toward sustainable investments, is expected to have widespread across the Canadian economy. His renowned maxim, "What gets measured gets managed," encapsulates his belief in data-driven transparency as a catalyst for environmental action. Real estate finance, inherently reliant on institutional lending and capital markets, stands to experience substantial shifts under these new financial sector guidelines. Mandatory climate risk disclosures could alter investment attractiveness, reshape lending practices, and influence asset valuation methodologies. Regulatory frameworks like Vancouver’s Climate Emergency Action Plan impose stringent emissions caps, substantial fines, and progressive tightening of standards. Buildings failing these benchmarks face diminished financing options, lower valuations, and decreased tenant appeal. In this regulatory landscape, institutional investors increasingly prioritize sustainability performance metrics, suggesting an evolving landscape where properties demonstrating superior environmental credentials will likely command valuation and rent premiums. Moreover, financial institutions and investors increasingly categorize assets failing sustainability standards as high-risk investments. Given the significant economic disruptions accompanying recent tariffs and international trade tensions, substantial stimulus investment in sustainable infrastructure, including commercial real estate, could deliver multifaceted economic benefits. For example, directing governmental funding toward sustainable commercial developments in urban cores might simultaneously stimulate economic recovery and address critical urban housing shortages through mixed-use projects. On the other hand, while Carney’s vision presents substantial opportunities, it also introduces complexities and potential risks. Carney’s historical emphasis on voluntary industry collaboration, such as the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero and Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, underscores a preference for cooperative rather than strictly regulatory frameworks. However, voluntary approaches alone might be insufficient, as their effectiveness can be undermined by subjective interpretations with a high risk of greenwashing. For instance, in recent months, four of Canada’s largest banks have withdrawn from the United Nations-backed Net-Zero Banking Alliance, an initiative specifically designed to accelerate climate action within the financial sector. This trend is mirrored in the U.S., where several major banks and leading asset management firms, such as BlackRock and Vanguard, also stepped away from prominent climate-focused asset manager alliances. These departures highlight the fragility of voluntary climate commitments and reinforce the need for robust, binding policies to promote transparency and accountability. Looking ahead, the shift from consumer carbon taxation toward structured incentives, financial market reforms, and integrated societal solutions positions real estate as a critical player in Canada’s sustainability journey. Carney’s proposed framework underscores the intricate balance between environmental stewardship, economic pragmatism, and social responsibility. For the commercial real estate industry, navigating this new paradigm will require strategic foresight, proactive adaptation, and collaborative engagement with both public and private stakeholders. As Canada embarks upon this ambitious sustainability trajectory, commercial real estate professionals must thoughtfully consider their roles, responsibilities, and opportunities. By proactively integrating sustainability into strategic decision-making the industry can not only thrive economically but also significantly contribute to Canada's sustainable future. This could be achieved through leveraging emerging incentives, adapting to regulatory complexities, embracing technology, and aligning with broader societal goal. Ultimately, the effectiveness of Carney’s vision will depend on its successful translation into actionable policies, transparent governance, and genuine stakeholder collaboration. For Canadian commercial real estate, this represents an unprecedented opportunity to lead by example, demonstrating how visionary climate policy can underpin enduring economic resilience and environmental sustainability.

Title: BlackRock Buys $2,500,000,000 Worth of Bitcoin As BTC Price Holds Steady: Arkham

New data from market intelligence firm Arkham reveals that asset management titan BlackRock purchased billions of dollars worth of Bitcoin (BTC) as the flagship crypto asset closes in on $100,000. In a new thread on the social media platform X, Arkham says that BlackRock, which has over $11 trillion in assets under management, bought $2.5 billion worth of BTC last week. In his annual letter to investors, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink suggests Bitcoin may one day become the world’s reserve currency, replacing the US dollar. Says Fink, “The US has benefited from the dollar serving as the world’s reserve currency for decades. But that’s not guaranteed to last forever. The national debt has grown at three times the pace of GDP since Times Square’s debt clock started ticking in 1989. This year, interest payments will surpass $952 billion – exceeding defense spending. By 2030, mandatory government spending and debt service will consume all federal revenue, creating a permanent deficit. If the US doesn’t get its debt under control, if deficits keep ballooning, America risks losing that position to digital assets like Bitcoin.” Meanwhile, Arkham notes that the publicly traded Bitcoin mining firm Riot Platforms is selling hundreds of BTC. “Riot just reported that they sold 475 BTC in April for $38.8 million. During April, they moved exactly 475 BTC to NYDIG. [Monday], they just moved another $6.7 million BTC to NYDIG. Are they selling even more this month?” Arkham data shows that the company’s portfolio now includes about 6,611 BTC, worth about $642 million at current prices. At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $97,238.

Title: 50 Companies Now Hiring Remote Jobs In 2025

ByRachel Wells ByRachel Wells, Contributor. Companies in tech, health, and defense industries have the greatest share of remote jobs Once upon a time, getting a good, stable job meant relocating into a big city, traveling into the office and skipping your son's baseball game while stuck for hours in never-ending traffic or the rush of the commute. Today, the workplace is being redefined. Remote work and hybrid models are popular amongst jobseekers and professionals eager to advance in their careers, and employers are embracing the challenge. Although many employers still prefer their workers to be in the office more than working from home, there's still a sizable number of companies still hiring for fully remote roles and hybrid roles too, so you can get the best of both worlds. You're able to progress your career at these companies just as well as if you were working at the office. And, at the same time, you won't have the guilt of missing out on your children's school activities or any aspect of your personal and family life. Plus, you'll even have time to work on a side hustle when you're working from home. Just a few weeks ago, FlexJobs, a popular remote and flexible work job board, analyzed the remote job listings within their database from January to March 2025. Their findings revealed that companies with the greatest share of remote job listings across that time period regularly reviewing reports like these enables you to keep a finger on the pulse of remote work trends and helps you make informed decisions as a job seeker so you can narrow down your employer choices and be more targeted with your job search. Here’s the full list: The main industries represented by these employers include healthcare (covering service providers and health insurance companies), financial services, investments and banking, IT, and defense and engineering. As a job seeker or professional passively looking for remote career opportunities, there are tons of ways to find remote work other than the traditional methods that everyone else uses, like scrolling through job boards. In fact, browsing Indeed and LinkedIn Jobs hoping for remote work opportunities is severely limiting you because there are so many other opportunities that you’re missing due to relying on stale methods. You need to remember that there is such a thing as the hidden job market, explained in detail here. In a nutshell, this means that most jobs never actually quite make it to a job board. Many are hidden within a company and you'll only find out about them through connecting with the right people and building your network strategically. Aligning yourself with decision-makers and building relationships with them will enable you to be put forward for referrals, making it easier for you to secure a job than hopelessly waiting to be progressed to the next stage after sending out hundreds of applications on Indeed. Here are some ways to find remote jobs that you probably haven’t considered: Freelancing allows you to work from anywhere on your own terms, and you could land a project as early as this week, so this is probably the fastest way to secure a contract or “job” while working from home. Applying directly on a company’s career page always beats applying for the same role via a posting on a job board. Go straight to the source as much as possible. Try: Lastly, try unconventional methods such as: If you’re feeling a little overwhelmed with this list, start your remote job search strategy by picking at least five companies from the “companies hiring” list above, researching them, tailoring your application materials, and then applying at least three of the strategies listed above to help you find more remote jobs or to connect you to the right people within these companies who would be hiring. Applying directly for remote jobs by finding outside-the-box approaches to contact hiring managers ... More allows you to secure remote work faster Try this approach each week, and you’ll find yourself hired faster than 90% of other job seekers…all because you decided to take an innovative, outside-the-box approach. You’re shifting your mindset beyond merely applying for jobs, and now you’re pitching yourself like a business, to partner with other companies to solve their problems. This adjustment is what will really make you stand out when looking for remote work.

Title: Irish Times readers on the Catholic Church: ‘I am very proud to be a Roman Catholic in Ireland today’

The conclave to choose the next head of the Catholic Church has begun, following the death of Pope Francis in April. While the world waits to hear who will be named the next pope, we asked our readers to submit their views on the Catholic Church. Bill Fox (66), a retired clinical psychologist from Co Sligo, says he is “very proud to be a Roman Catholic in Ireland today”. “I have always practised my faith, apart from lapsing for a few months while I was a student. “I have been a Minister of the Word for about 30 years and a Minister of the Eucharist for about 23 years ... My religious faith has become more important to me in later life.” He says he attends Mass on a weekly basis and prays “every day”. Liam Bairéad (74), from Dublin, experienced a lapse in faith in his 20s but now describes his “sense of God at the centre of everything good” as “very strong”. A retired secondary schoolteacher, he was “raised in a strongly Catholic household”. “By the age of 20 I had turned my back on the Catholic Church and religion in general. I lost all faith in God and became, very consciously, a materialist and an atheist. [ Have Your Say: What is your view on the Catholic Church?Opens in new window ] “Then a series of incidents and encounters and my reflections on them caused me to become a lapsed atheist by the time I was 25. I returned to the practice of the Catholic faith, particularly the Mass and the Eucharist,” he says. Michael O’Flanagan (33), from Dublin, believes “the papacy of Pope Francis has opened the doors for a more welcoming and inclusive church”. “As a young person in my early 30s the papacy of Pope Francis brought me closer to the institutional church, but the humility of Pope Francis brought the institutional church closer to God,” he says. Concern regarding the continued involvement of religious orders in the Irish education system was one issue that recurred in responses. Anna McCabe (91), from Longford, says she “joined Atheist Ireland and later the Humanist Association of Ireland” after her belief in Catholic teachings faded. “I no longer believed what they taught me as a child and what I taught to primary schoolchildren for many years ... I consider teaching religion to young children as a form of child abuse. I think religion should be taught outside school.” Mike Gogan (62), a copy writer from Dublin, also chose to distance himself from the Catholic Church “as a young man in 1986”, saying he has “not looked back” since. “At the time my mother questioned my actions, but as soon as the reports of abuse started to emerge, she understood. I have not looked back and have been actively involved in trying to remove the influence of the church in our education system.” Some felt they could talk more freely without being fully identified, such as Aidan from Dublin, who said: “[I was] baptised by my parents as a Catholic and educated at Willow Park and Blackrock ... I had lost faith long before my fellow students revealed the horrific abuse at the hands of priests, but it really added to my anger thinking of the two-faced piety and sanctimony of pulpit paedophiles being enabled by the Catholic Church omertà which prevailed for so long in Ireland.” While he no longer practices nor believes “in a man-made religion”, he “still somewhat regret[s] not having a faith of any kind”, adding that “it must be a comfort to those who do”. Having grown up in south Dublin and now living in Switzerland, Seán Redmond (54) says he “wish[es] that the Catholic church was less Catholic and more Christian”. “Since I was a child, I have seen the Catholic hierarchy on one side of the current culture war we are in and the priests on another,” says Mr Redmond, describing himself as “more aligned with the poor priests than with the hierarchy”. I felt cushioned in a blanket of prayers ... The unchanging tenets of my faith are an anchor in these uncertain times “Why can’t women be priests? Why can’t priests have children? What is wrong with being LGBTQ? Is the command to love one another as I have loved you too complicated in a patriarchal society? Why must the majority cardinals and bishops be over 70?” he asks. Paul (67), who works in the education sector in Dublin, says despite coming “from a devout Catholic family” his own faith waned and by his early teens he had “ceased to believe the bulk of Catholic teaching”. “Growing older, I began to witness so much of what I found repulsive about Catholicism,” he says, listing “the wealth of the Vatican and the grandiose pomp and ceremony that accompanies it ... the misogyny and obsession with sexuality ... and then of course, the revelations of the breadth and depravity of physical and sexual abuse perpetrated by so many ordained members of the church” among examples. For others, like retired secondary schoolteacher Breid Carberry (68) from Co Donegal, Catholicism has offered solace during difficult periods. “I have had a lot of illness in my life and my Catholic faith sustains and comforts me in good times and bad,” says Carberry, reflecting on her diagnosis of breast cancer. “I felt cushioned in a blanket of prayers ... The unchanging tenets of my faith are an anchor in these uncertain times.” [ New pope will face a Vatican budget crisis and myriad other problemsOpens in new window ] Siobhán Cullen (61), from Kildare says her religious upbringing informed her current relationship with Catholicism. “I go to Mass on Sunday and my faith is important to me. My parents were very religious, as were most parents of the 1960s, and they passed on that faith to me and my siblings. I left the church for a while in my late teens, but came back to it in my mid-20s and it has been a great source of comfort and joy to me. “I realise that this has not been the case for a lot of people and can understand how this has turned them against the church. It was truly horrendous what went on and the church should pay recompense to those victims. I have been lucky in that the priests and nuns I met were good people and did great work for the community.” Ursula (57), a self-described “cradle-Catholic”, also from Kildare, attends Mass daily. “Through faith and the 10 commandments, I don’t agree with a lot of societal change,” she says, citing abortion as an example, “but we all have free will and I can’t judge anyone. “My prayer is always ‘let not their sin become mine’. In other words, if I judge others, I am creating a greater sin. This life is where we choose to follow Jesus or not.” © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Why The Future For Financial Advisors Is In The Private Market

ByAtish Davda ByAtish Davda, Forbes Councils Member. Atish Davda is EquityZen's CEO, former quant at AQR Capital and a Penn alum who loves FinTech, Python, traveling and tennis. The secret is out about private markets. BlackRock’s recent announcement that its model portfolios will now incorporate private market investments marks a pivotal shift in the investment landscape. This move may make a significant impact in democratizing access to private assets—something to which I’ve dedicated my career. Big market moves like this also challenge the status quo. If BlackRock’s model portfolios make private market investments the norm, financial advisors may need to rethink their strategies to remain competitive. The global economy is currently facing substantial headwinds. President Trump’s tariff announcements have injected uncertainty into the markets, with fears of a potential recession looming. These protectionist measures have led to increased market volatility, prompting investors to seek alternative avenues for diversification and stability. The market landscape makes BlackRock’s strategic shift toward private markets all the more timely. By blending private and publicly traded assets, BlackRock aims to provide investors with more diversified and resilient investment portfolios. This move reflects a broader industry trend toward incorporating alternative assets to dampen the effects of volatility, while capturing the illiquidity premium and providing the potential for better risk-adjusted returns. All market evolutions—from the launch of ETFs to SPACs—present both opportunities and challenges for financial advisors. Now that individual investors can more easily gain diversified exposure to alternatives while paying much lower fees than an advisor may charge, advisors will be challenged to further prove their value add. Here are some of the ways they can with regard to private market investments. ​ With private market investments becoming more accessible to individual investors, advisors can distinguish themselves by developing deep expertise in this market. Understanding the nuances of private assets, including their risk profiles and liquidity constraints, will be crucial.​ More financial advisors are differentiating themselves from their peers by building knowledge on the private markets. Whether providing liquidity to clients who are early employees or investors in startups or knowing the ins and outs of secondary transactions, they prove their value by their expertise in a growing, but niche market. Advisors can also consider expanding their product suite to include differentiated options that are best-suited to their clients’ individual needs. This could involve partnerships with platforms that offer access to private investments or advisors developing in-house capabilities to evaluate and recommend private assets.​ RIAs tell me that their clients seek access to the technology companies at the forefront of innovation in industries such as artificial intelligence and cybersecurity. There are different avenues to provide this access—each with different time horizons, investment minimums and investment structures. Much like they have with direct indexing in public portfolios, advisors can identify and curate private market products for their specific clients. As private market investments become integrated into portfolios, educating clients about these assets becomes imperative. While the private market is growing rapidly, it can still be opaque and daunting to the uninformed. Talking with clients about private investments’ potential benefits and risks will build trust.​ Not every private market investment is right for every client. Advisors can help clients understand their options and choose the most appropriate investments for their situation and goals. The financial market is undergoing a massive change as alternatives—once a wealth creation avenue only available for the ultra-wealthy—go mainstream. With the number of public companies continuing to diminish, it is more important than ever to offer this access to clients of all sizes. I steadfastly believe that the future of investments is in the private market. BlackRock’s vocal endorsement of private markets is a clarion call for financial advisors to evolve and meet this moment. By deepening their understanding of private assets, diversifying their offerings and educating clients, advisors can differentiate themselves while providing enhanced value in this new investment era. Embracing this shift is not just about staying competitive. It’s about leading the way in democratizing access to investment opportunities for all. Not all pre-IPO companies will go public or be acquired, and not all IPOs or acquisitions are or will become successful investments. There are inherent risks in pre-IPO investments, including the risk of loss of the entire investment, illiquidity, and fluctuations in value and returns. Investors must be able to afford the loss of their entire investment.

Title: Greystone Housing Impact Investors Reports First Quarter 2025 Financial Results

May 07, 2025 08:15 ET | Source: Greystone Housing Impact Investors LP Greystone Housing Impact Investors LP OMAHA, Neb., May 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- On May 7, 2025, Greystone Housing Impact Investors LP (NYSE: GHI) (the “Partnership”) announced financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2025. Financial Highlights The Partnership reported the following results as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2025: The difference between reported net income per BUC and CAD per BUC is primarily due to the treatment of unrealized losses on the Partnership’s interest rate derivative positions. Unrealized losses of approximately $3.9 million are included in net income for the three months ended March 31, 2025. Unrealized losses are a result of the impact of decreased market interest rates on the calculated fair value of the Partnership’s interest rate derivative positions. Unrealized gains and losses do not affect our cash earnings and are added back to net income when calculating the Partnership’s CAD. The Partnership received net cash from its interest rate derivative positions totaling approximately $847,000 during the first quarter. In March 2025, the Partnership announced that the Board of Managers of Greystone AF Manager LLC declared a regular quarterly distribution to the Partnership's BUC holders of $0.37 per BUC. The distribution was paid on April 30, 2025, to BUC holders of record as of the close of trading on March 31, 2025. Management Remarks “We continue to evaluate investment opportunities despite continuing market volatility,” said Kenneth C. Rogozinski, the Partnership’s Chief Executive Officer. “Our successful Series B Preferred Units issuance provides low-cost, non-dilutive capital for us to deploy into accretive investment opportunities. In addition, the dedicated pool of capital that we have from the new BlackRock construction lending joint venture is a powerful tool for us to serve our affordable housing developer relationship base.” Recent Investment and Financing Activity The Partnership reported the following updates for the first quarter of 2025: In May 2025, the managing member of Vantage at Helotes sold the property to a governmental entity who in turn leased the property to a non-profit entity. That non-profit entity financed its purchase of the leasehold interest by issuing tax-exempt and taxable bonds. The Partnership received gross proceeds of approximately $17.1 million, inclusive of the return of capital contributions and accrued preferred return. The Partnership expects to recognize investment income of approximately $1.8 million and a gain on sale of approximately $163,000 in the second quarter of 2025, before settlement of final proceeds and expenses. The Partnership expects to recognize approximately $0.08 of net income per BUC, basic and diluted, and CAD per BUC, based on the number of BUCs outstanding on the date of sale. Investment Portfolio Updates The Partnership announced the following updates regarding its investment portfolio: Earnings Webcast & Conference Call The Partnership will host a conference call for investors on Wednesday, May 7, 2025 at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time to discuss the Partnership’s First Quarter 2025 results.

A recorded replay of the webcast will be made available on the Partnership’s Investor Relations website at http://www.ghiinvestors.com. About Greystone Housing Impact Investors LP Greystone Housing Impact Investors LP was formed in 1998 under the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act for the primary purpose of acquiring, holding, selling and otherwise dealing with a portfolio of mortgage revenue bonds which have been issued to provide construction and/or permanent financing for affordable multifamily, seniors and student housing properties. The Partnership is pursuing a business strategy of acquiring additional mortgage revenue bonds and other investments on a leveraged basis. The Partnership expects and believes the interest earned on these mortgage revenue bonds is excludable from gross income for federal income tax purposes. The Partnership seeks to achieve its investment growth strategy by investing in additional mortgage revenue bonds and other investments as permitted by its Second Amended and Restated Limited Partnership Agreement, dated December 5, 2022 (the “Partnership Agreement”), taking advantage of attractive financing structures available in the securities market, and entering into interest rate risk management instruments. Greystone Housing Impact Investors LP press releases are available at www.ghiinvestors.com. Safe Harbor Statement Certain statements in this press release are intended to be covered by the safe harbor for “forward-looking statements” provided by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements generally can be identified by use of statements that include, but are not limited to, phrases such as “believe,” “expect,” “future,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “foresee,” “may,” “should,” “will,” “estimates,” “potential,” “continue,” or other similar words or phrases. Similarly, statements that describe objectives, plans, or goals also are forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and are generally beyond the control of the Partnership. The Partnership cautions readers that a number of important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in, implied, or projected by such forward-looking statements. Risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: defaults on the mortgage loans securing our mortgage revenue bonds and governmental issuer loans; the competitive environment in which the Partnership operates; risks associated with investing in multifamily, student, senior citizen residential properties and commercial properties; general economic, geopolitical, and financial conditions, including the current and future impact of changing interest rates, inflation, and international conflicts (including the Russia-Ukraine war and the Israel-Hamas war) on business operations, employment, and financial conditions; uncertain conditions within the domestic and international macroeconomic environment, including monetary and fiscal policy and conditions in the investment, credit, interest rate, and derivatives markets; any effects on our business resulting from new U.S. domestic or foreign governmental trade measures, including but not limited to tariffs, import and export controls, foreign exchange intervention accomplished to offset the effects of trade policy or in response to currency volatility, and other restrictions on free trade; adverse reactions in U.S. financial markets related to actions of foreign central banks or the economic performance of foreign economies, including in particular China, Japan, the European Union, and the United Kingdom; the general condition of the real estate markets in the regions in which the Partnership operates, which may be unfavorably impacted by pressures in the commercial real estate sector, incrementally higher unemployment rates, persistent elevated inflation levels, and other factors; changes in interest rates and credit spreads, as well as the success of any hedging strategies the Partnership may undertake in relation to such changes, and the effect such changes may have on the relative spreads between the yield on investments and cost of financing; the aggregate effect of elevated inflation levels over the past several years, spurred by multiple factors including expansionary monetary and fiscal policy, higher commodity prices, a tight labor market, and low residential vacancy rates, which may result in continued elevated interest rate levels and increased market volatility; the Partnership’s ability to access debt and equity capital to finance its assets; current maturities of the Partnership’s financing arrangements and the Partnership’s ability to renew or refinance such financing arrangements; local, regional, national and international economic and credit market conditions; recapture of previously issued Low Income Housing Tax Credits in accordance with Section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code; geographic concentration of properties related to investments held by the Partnership; changes in the U.S. corporate tax code and other government regulations affecting the Partnership’s business; and the other risks detailed in the Partnership’s SEC filings (including but not limited to, the Partnership’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and Current Reports on Form 8-K). Readers are urged to consider these factors carefully in evaluating the forward-looking statements. If any of these risks or uncertainties materializes or if any of the assumptions underlying such forward-looking statements proves to be incorrect, the developments and future events concerning the Partnership set forth in this press release may differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these statements, which speak only as of the date of this document. We anticipate that subsequent events and developments will cause our expectations and beliefs to change. The Partnership assumes no obligation to update such forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this document or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events, unless obligated to do so under the federal securities laws. Disclosure Regarding Non-GAAP Measures - Cash Available for Distribution The Partnership believes that CAD provides relevant information about the Partnership’s operations and is necessary, along with net income, for understanding its operating results. To calculate CAD, the Partnership begins with net income as computed in accordance with GAAP and adjusts for non-cash expenses or income consisting of depreciation expense, amortization expense related to deferred financing costs, amortization of premiums and discounts, fair value adjustments to derivative instruments, provisions for credit and loan losses, impairments on MRBs, GILs, real estate assets and property loans, deferred income tax expense (benefit), and restricted unit compensation expense. The Partnership also adjusts net income for the Partnership’s share of (earnings) losses of investments in unconsolidated entities as such amounts are primarily depreciation expenses and development costs that are expected to be recovered upon an exit event. The Partnership also deducts Tier 2 income (see Note 22 to the Partnership’s condensed consolidated financial statements) distributable to the General Partner as defined in the Partnership Agreement and distributions and accretion for the Preferred Units. Net income is the GAAP measure most comparable to CAD. There is no generally accepted methodology for computing CAD, and the Partnership’s computation of CAD may not be comparable to CAD reported by other companies. Although the Partnership considers CAD to be a useful measure of the Partnership’s operating performance, CAD is a non-GAAP measure that should not be considered as an alternative to net income calculated in accordance with GAAP, or any other measures of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP. The following table shows the calculation of CAD (and a reconciliation of the Partnership’s net income, as determined in accordance with GAAP, to CAD) for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024 (all per BUC amounts are presented giving effect to the BUCs Distributions described in Note 22 of the condensed consolidated financial statements on a retroactive basis for all periods presented): MEDIA CONTACT: Karen Marotta Greystone 212-896-9149 Karen.Marotta@greyco.com INVESTOR CONTACT:Andy GrierInvestors Relations402-952-1235 OMAHA, Neb., April 23, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Greystone Housing Impact Investors LP (NYSE: GHI) (the “Partnership”) announced today that it will host a conference call for investors on Wednesday,...

Title: eToro seeks to raise $500M through IPO

Let Banking Dive's free newsletter keep you informed, straight from your inbox. The investment fintech, targeting a $4 billion valuation, is expected to launch on the Nasdaq index May 14. Social investment fintech eToro is seeking to raise $500 million through its initial public offering in the U.S., targeting a valuation of $4 billion and an expected IPO date of May 14. The firm and some of its shareholders are offering 10 million shares for between $46 and $50 each, according to a securities filing, half of which are being offered by the company and half by the shareholders. Founded in 2007 in Tel Aviv, Israel by brothers Yoni Assia and Ronen Assia and cofounder David Ring, eToro is a social trading app that allows users to replicate the trading strategies of top investors. It has over 40 million users, according to the securities filing. After first filing in late March, eToro put a hold on its IPO pursuit due to tariff-related market volatility that followed President Donald Trump’s major tariffs announcement in early April, Bloomberg reported. Buy now,pay later fintech Klarna also paused its IPO for the same reason, The Wall Street Journal reported. But in eToro’s May 5 IPO filing, the company said that certain funds and accounts managed by BlackRock, the firm’s cornerstone investor, have indicated an interest in purchasing as much as $100 million in shares at the IPO price. For 2024, eToro reported a net contribution of $787 million in 2024 and net income of $192 million. The figures represent a 41% increase and 1,161% increase, respectively, from the prior year, according to the filing. The company is in a quiet period following the IPO filing and did not provide comment beyond the press release. eToro was among the firms named by fintech investor Nigel Morris, QED Investors co-founder, as part of a “generation” likely to file IPOs this year. “In 2021, there were 61 fintech IPOs,” he said during his keynote at Fintech Meetup in March. “Since 2021, there’s been a total of 13.” “Now we have a cohort of companies that are at scale, they’re profitable, they’re growing fast, that have business models that make sense,” he said, naming Klarna, Circle and eToro. All three have since filed an IPO. “Notwithstanding the turbulence of the angry markets this week and today … there’s no doubt that these companies are IPO-ready and will be [in] the right window, either at the end of this quarter or next quarter, that will see a whole generation of them,” Morris said. “And with that, there’ll be a wave of valuations that are market-tested … these are really powerful and capable companies.” eToro’s IPO is being led by Goldman Sachs, Jefferies, UBS and Citi. Shares are expected to trade under the ticker symbol ETOR on the Nasdaq Global Select Market.

Title: Spot Bitcoin ETFs Clinch $1.8B Weekly Inflows, Will Bulls Retest $100k Price?

Crypto institutional investors ramp up inflows to spot Bitcoin ETFs following a swift recovery and expected price consolidation. The last seven days saw a net jump in total digital asset products alongside soaring trading volumes. As institutional sentiment spikes, traders are primed for a run above $100k, although certain macro indicators could hinder the upward drive. On-chain data shows spot Bitcoin ETFs added $1.8 billion, triggering bullish sentiments in the last seven days. This comes from renewed speculation for a massive price jump in May. Following the last dip and the recovery, which kicked off in the previous two weeks, traders began high-end accumulations seeking to break new positions. Traditional investors also caught the wave as they shifted through gears. According to SoSoValue data, net inflows topped $40.25 billion on May 2, marking the highest level since Feb 11. These products gained traction after the previous two months as the White House lowered tariff pressure. The previous week saw a much larger $3 billion inflow coming off a string of outflows. Currently, bull pressures are backed by new centralized institutions increasing their appetite for the asset class. Firms like Strategy and Metaplanet have intensified acquisitions in the same period. Last month, Cantor, Tether, SoftBank, and Bitfinex announced plans to roll out a Bitcoin acquisition firm. This influx of institutional demand has shaped trader confidence as they aim for new cycle peaks. Per pseudonymous Bitcoin enthusiast BlockChair, metrics are strengthening due to huge ETF inflows. “Institutional adoption of Bitcoin continues to accelerate. With spot ETFs absorbing 6x the weekly mined supply and BlackRock dominating holdings, the supply squeeze narrative grows stronger. A 2% BTC allocation across traditional portfolios would indeed be transformative.” For most digital asset commentators, the next point is another push through the $95k price to set the tone for a larger $100k level. After swings in the past few months, this psychological level remains important for Bitcoin holders. Bitcoin price dropped 22% from an all-time high above $108k, ushering in fresh outflows in the wider market. If the price reclaims $100k this month, bulls’ projections could be in play due to skyrocketing institutional inflows and on-chain metrics. Long-term holders are back in the green zone, spiking new retail investors.

Business FILE PHOTO: Dark clouds are seen over the building of the European Central Bank (ECB) before the ECB's monetary policy meeting in Frankfurt, Germany, June 6, 2024. REUTERS/Wolfgang Rattay/File Photo LONDON : The rush to cut interest rates at major central banks slowed to a trickle in April, as policymakers faced uncertainty on the outlook for economic growth and inflation in the wake of escalating trade tensions. Two of the five central banks overseeing the 10 most heavily traded currencies that held meetings in April - the European Central Bank and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand – lowered interest rates by a cumulative 50 basis points. Rate setters in Australia, Japan and Canada left benchmarks unchanged, while central banks in Sweden, Switzerland, Norway, Britain and the United States did not meet in April. In February, half of the G10 central banks cut interest rates. The main focus now shifts to the U.S. Federal Reserve, which concludes its rate setting meeting later on Wednesday.

Title: IBIT acquires 5,613 BTC worth $530M in one day – Details and effects!

Is BlackRock triggering the next crypto bull run? BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has reignited investor momentum with a powerful streak of 15 straight days of inflows. This has simply underscored renewed institutional confidence in Bitcoin [BTC]. On 5 May alone, the asset manager acquired 5,613 BTC, valued at approximately $530 million – Solidifying IBIT’s dominance in a week where most other ETFs saw flat or negative flows. With total inflows since inception now surpassing $44 billion, BlackRock’s aggressive accumulation reinforces its outsized influence on the broader crypto ETF landscape. It also means that institutional appetite for Bitcoin exposure remains strong. Remarking on the same, Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas took to X and noted, “Deja vu in the weekly flows w/ $VOO and $IBIT in the top spots, just like last year when ‘beta with a side of bitcoin’ was the big theme. $IBIT now 8th in YTD flows (was out of Top 50 at one point) with +$6.4b. Been hoovering up btc like a madman ever since the decoupling.” In the thread, he further added, “One interesting note also is $IBIT taking in SO much more then the rest of them (altho 10 of them have seen inflows). Usually there’s much more parity tho. Why is this? My theory, return of the HF basis trade and some big fish biting after the decoupling and subsequent rally.” Additionally, Bitcoin’s stability above the $90,000 threshold, even after a modest 0.42% dip in the last 24 hours, alluded to growing confidence in the asset’s long-term trajectory. This price level, once seen as highly ambitious, now might be a stepping stone towards the psychological $100,000-mark. Notably, key technical indicators such as the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) and Relative Strength Index (RSI) were in bullish territory at press time. This reinforced the idea that short-term dips may be part of a healthy consolidation phase, rather than a reversal. Source: Trading View Additionally, BlackRock’s IBIT has been seeing renewed investor appetite for quite some time too. Even on 24 April, IBIT recorded massive inflows worth $442 million. Needless to say, Blackrock’s success is not just limited to Bitcoin. Even in the case of Ethereum [ETH], Blackrock’s ETHA has been the reason behind the cumulative inflows spot ETH ETFs have been getting. The scale of institutional influx is a sign that market participants may be positioning for another leg up. It also further strengthens the case for a sustained rally in the coming weeks.
