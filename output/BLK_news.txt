The Energia All-Ireland League enters the homeward straight with the last three rounds of the regular season over the next three weekends, and nowhere is there more of a make-or-break feel to the day’s action than on the Aviva Stadium back pitch. Fifth-placed Lansdowne, Division 1A’s form team, host third place Terenure, who go into the game on 48 points, just above Cork Con on points difference and just two points ahead of their hosts. Lansdowne have won five of their last six games to close in on the top four and the playoffs, their only defeat being in that sequence being a 49-46 loss away to Clontarf when beaten with the last kick of the game. Interestingly, the former Cork Con back three player Rob Hedderman, who scored a try in last season’s final against Terenure, is named for a rare start on the wing. Terenure, themselves beaten with the game’s final kick by Clontarf last time out three weeks ago, have been hit by Leinster dipping into their squad for their trek to South Africa, with outhalf Caspar Gabriel, scrumhalf Fintan Gunne and fullback Henry McIrlean all on duty with their province. Conor McKeon, the former Connacht scrumhalf, starts at outhalf, with Aran Egan remaining at fullback and Alan Bennie at scrumhalf. Lansdowne, perhaps benefiting from not having any players in the Ireland Club side for their win in Portugal, are also seeking revenge for the 28-22 defeat in Lakelands in round three, and quite simply whoever wins this reprise of last season’s semi-final will find themselves in the top four, whereas whoever loses will be outside the playoff picture entering the final two rounds. Young Munster are technically the only team with seemingly nothing tangible to play for in the top flight, yet they have picked a notably strong looking side for the visit of Cork Con. Evan O’Connell, scrumhalf Jake O’Riordan, centre Shay McCarthy and fullback Patrick Campbell have all been released by Munster for this game, and the former Ireland Under-20 and current Munster academy winger Fionn Gibbons is named on the bench for what will be his first game of the season since rupturing his ACL last summer. The champions have seen an eight-game undefeated run come to a halt with successive defeats but retain a settled side featuring a strong midfield of Niall Kenneally and Seán French. After their fifth last-ditch win of the season, leaders Clontarf are now eyeing up a home semi-final and will be strongly fancied to take another stride toward that objective at home to a understrength UCD side who have also been hit by Leinster’s trek to South Africa. Already without key backrower Ronan Waters, St Mary’s have also lost Ethan Baxter after he was injured on Ireland Club duty, so ex-Munster centre Dan Goggin starts at number eight at home to a strong looking Ballynahinch. City of Armagh should take a step towards preserving their 1A status at home to Garryowen, for whom a 15th successive defeat will confirm their relegation. Energia Men’s All-Ireland League (2.30pm unless stated) Division 1A: City of Armagh v Garryowen, Palace Grounds; Clontarf v UCD, Castle Avenue; Lansdowne v Terenure College, Aviva back pitch; St Mary’s College v Ballynahinch, Templeville Road; Young Munster v Cork Constitution, Tom Clifford Park.

Send an email to Virginia. PANAMA CITY, Panama—If China wanted to disable the Panama Canal to stop the flow of military or cargo ships through it, it likely could do so through an attack on the software system, military veteran and “Hot Zone” podcaster Chuck Holton says. Using a Chinese ship to physically block the canal could cause a temporary disruption, but a cyberattack would likely create a much more serious issue, according to Holton, a former U.S. Army Ranger-turned-war correspondent. If China were to “scrambled the software that is used to open and close the locks, or something like that, now you’ve got a bigger problem,” Holton said, adding that it is “very likely” China already has the ability to “scramble” the technology used to operate the Panama Canal. The “software that runs the canal, very likely, is also infected with Chinese hackers,” he said, and if China “wanted to damage or shut down the canal, they could probably do it from Beijing with a few keystrokes. They don’t have to have Chinese troops at the port and they don’t. They don’t need them.” Holton, who serves as a foreign correspondent for Newsmax, lives in Panama and was part of the U.S. military invasion of Panama in 1989 to oust the nation’s corrupt dictator, Manuel Noriega. Standing in the square of Casco Viejo, Panama City’s historic district, Holton told The Daily Signal that China is actively working to gain influence in Panama, but “China is not running the canal.” During his inauguration speech on Jan. 20, President Donald Trump said, “China is operating the Panama Canal. And we didn’t give it to China. We gave it to Panama, and we’re taking it back.” But Panama President José Raúl Mulino denies China is operating the canal. Trump’s comments on the canal, coupled with a recent large canal port deal between an American-based company and a Hong Kong-based company, have called attention to China’s influence in the region. The Chinese government has been critical of a deal for a Hong Kong conglomerate, CK Hutchison, to sell ports in the Panama Canal to BlackRock, an American global asset manager. Trump has praised the deal, but CK Hutchison says the agreed-upon deal is “purely commercial” and has nothing to do with Trump’s recent comments on the canal. About 10,000 people work at the canal, the majority of whom, according to Holton, are Panamanian. The U.S. built the Panama Canal and operated it for decades, but in 1977, President Jimmy Carter signed a treaty with Panama to begin the gradual transfer of the canal to Panama, with the complete transfer by the end of 1999. The canal connects the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and operates through a lock system, raising ships above sea level to connect to the Gatun Lake before lowering them back to sea level. On average, 36 to 38 ships pass through the canal each day, according to The Associated Press. About 70% of the ships passing through the canal are coming from or headed for the U.S., though the shipping companies themselves may not be American. U.S. military ships do use the canal, and in the event of a conflict with China, anything China “could do that would complicate the U.S. Navy’s ability to move troops and products … into or out of the war zone, obviously, that’s a strategic issue for the United States,” Holton said. For years, Holton explained, China has been growing its power in Panama through economic and political ties. Panama joined the Belt and Road Initiative, a Chinese-led investment and infrastructure project, in 2017, but announced in February that it would not renew its participation in the Chinese project. China’s presence in Panama is not new, though political and economic ties are more recent. The first groups of Chinese arrived in Panama in the 1850s to help build the trans-Panama railroad. China’s influence is noticeable in the Latin nation through the presence of Chinese cultural centers, architecture, and Chinese-owned businesses. Holton says Panamanians know the nation has “a problem with Chinese influence, and it’s more with our government, it’s more with our economic system,” but, he added, the same cannot be said of the canal. Right now, the relationship between the U.S. and Panama is “confusing,” he said, because “Panama is an ally of the United States. Panamanians love Americans. They’ll say all the time that America’s our big brother … and so they’re a little befuddled by the president’s comments that seem very antithetical to, or negative toward, Panama.” The U.S. has a “long history of being a blessing to Panama,” Holton said, adding, “I don’t see why we need to change that now. That should be, the question is: How can we come and have a win-win situation with Panama and the United States? And there certainly is a path forward for that.” Dive into the brilliant mind of Victor Davis Hanson, renowned classicist, historian, and Senior Contributor at The Daily Signal.

Title: Amid Trump Tariffs, Where Do China-Mexico Ties Stand?

Read The Diplomat, Know The Asia-Pacific Mexico’s government is attempting to downplay its relationship with China to avoid Trump’s ire, but ties continue beneath the surface. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum (left) meets with Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of theG-20 summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Nov. 18, 2024. In the beginning of March 2025, I traveled to Mexico to speak with a range of officials and experts about activities by the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and its companies in the country, among other topics. In the midst of U.S. attention to China’s activities in Mexico and across the region, and in the face of threatened U.S. tariffs against Mexican products, the Mexican government of Claudia Sheinbaum is reportedly attempting to restrain high-profile activities with China that it perceives could antagonize the Trump administration. Nonetheless, beyond a small number of completed or postponed projects with China – such as a BYD hybrid car plant and the Maya tourist train – that have received particular high-level U..S scrutiny, the China-Mexico relationship continues to grow and deepen. Political Relations President Sheinbaum’s caution toward China appears to be reciprocated by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). It’s been over three months since China’s outspoken former ambassador to Mexico, Zhang Run, departed for a post in the Foreign Ministry at the end of 2024, yet the Chinese government has not yet named a new ambassador. That’s particularly unusual in CCP engagement with a country as large and important as Mexico. Beyond the state-to-state relations, China’s engagement in Mexico also extends to the legislative branch and subnational governments. There is a China friendship committee and an Asia committee in the Mexican legislature headed by leftist Workers’ Party (PT) member Yeidckol Polevnsky. Senate President Geraldo Fernandez Noroña, also of the PT and considered more radical than Polevnsky, is a powerful advocate for strengthening Mexico’s relations with China and reportedly has a close relationship with China’s embassy. China also courts Mexico at the state and local level, both through regular business delegations to Mexican states, few of which bear fruit, as well as at least 15 Mexico-China “sister city” relationships. Military and Defense Ties In military affairs, the current and recent Mexican administrations have restricted engagement with China. This year, neither the Mexican Army War College (CODENAL) nor the Navy War College (CESNAV) are hosting People’s Liberation Army (PLA) cadets, although the army has done so previously. In 2024, CESNAV hosted a visit by a sizable contingent from the PLA Superior War College. Also, in September 2023, a delegation of 16 PLA members, as well as a military delegation from Russia, visited and marched in Mexico’s Independence Day parade. Although China has not sold Mexico substantial military equipment, it did participate in an ill-fated joint venture to assemble 6.5 ton First Auto Works (FAW) trucks in Mexico. A China-based company also reportedly sold the Mexican Army uniforms, with the Mexican partner company – which is tied to Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador (AMLO) ally and former Interior Minister Adan Agosto Lopez – reportedly profiting from a 300 percent markup on the cost paid to the Chinese wholesalers. In addition, the Mexican Navy purchased three Chinese catamarans for $26.7 million for a tourist transit, which it operates from Mazatlán to the island of San Blas. Beyond arms sales and engagements, China has assigned a capable military attaché, Army Colonel Cui Yungmao, seeking to strengthen military engagement and pursue arms sales opportunities. Cui reportedly has excellent Spanish and is a regular visitor at Mexican Army and Navy military institutions. China-based military companies regularly have a substantial presence at the annual Mexican Air Force air show (FAMEX), which they reportedly use to court the Mexican military and the Mexican Space Agency (MSA). Beijing has long courted the MSA. The National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) has reportedly signed agreements with the Technical University of Beijing to bring students to China for graduate-level training on satellites and space sciences. On the other hand, the MSA’s plan to launch a satellite in China was reportedly switched to another provider and another site, possibly to avoid alarming the Trump administration. Chinese Private Security Companies (PSCs), represented in organizations such as the Mexico-Chinese Private Security Council, have sought work in the Mexican market, but have not to date established a substantial presence. Drones from the Chinese firm DJI and Chinese-made military equipment, including body armor used in confrontations against the Mexican military and other adversaries, are reportedly readily available for purchase by criminal organizations in Mexico on the black market. Chinese Investment in Mexico In commerce, driven by nearshoring, Chinese investment in Mexico in recent years has expanded to approximately $2 billion per year. The well-respected commercial consultancy Rhodium Group identified $13 billion in Chinese investment in Mexico in approximately 700 transactions between 2013 and 2023. In the digital space, Huawei has become a leading infrastructure provider, diversifying from telephone equipment to other services. Indeed, by 2024, Huawei had invested an estimated $1.3 billion in Mexican cloud computing infrastructure alone. The company, principally through Telmex, is also reportedly providing such services and infrastructure to the Mexican government, including the presidency, the Secretariat for Communication and Transportation (SCT), and a number of ministries. There are also rumors of a Huawei offer to provide technology and data services to the country’s national intelligence centers. In addition to Huawei, a range of Chinese companies are active in Mexico’s telephone sector, including Oppo, whose Mexico market share has reportedly expanded rapidly in recent years, as well as the China-based companies Honor, Xiaomi, and ZTE. The Chinese company Hikvision, operating in Mexico since 2016, including a research center in Queretaro, continues to be a dominant player in commercial and private security systems, including a number of initiatives to provide cameras for public security for towns around Mexico. Chinese computer and electronics manufacturer Lenovo has made Mexico its largest production and research and development (R&D) hub in Latin America, expanding its sales to the Mexican market by 25 percent in 2023 alone. Reportedly, Lenovo tries to keep out of the public spotlight. This year’s $22.8 billion acquisition by Blackrock of 80 percent of the properties of Hong Kong-based Hutchison Ports will dramatically change the Chinese profile in the port sector. Hutchison had previously operated ports in Veracruz, Lazaro Cardenas, Manzanillo, Tijuana, and Ensenada. In the automotive sector, although plans for a factory by the electric car maker BYD remain on hold, Giant Motor Corporation, which represents First Auto Works (FAW) and the Anhui Jianghuai Automobile Group Corp (JAC) production facility in Hidalgo, as well as Shanghai Automotive industrial Corporation (SAIC) and Beijing Automotive Industrial Corporation (BAIC), continue to have a substantial presence in the Mexican market. BAIC and Foton are major players in the market for buses. In construction, although the China Communication Construction Corporation (CCCC), in conjunction with the 30 percent CCCC-owned Mota Engil, have completed most of the track work for the Maya tourist train, there is a question of their continuing role. The Mexican Army continues to build train stations and other facilities to make the infrastructure functional. In a similar fashion, although China Railway has completed most of its improvements to Line 1 of the Mexico City Metro, it continues a presence on the line with a long-term maintenance contract. China-based companies have expressed interest in investing in warehousing, logistics, and other facilities in Mexico’s “Trans-Isthmus Corridor,” whose development is a priority for the Sheinbaum government. To date, no concrete projects have yet materialized. In the lithium sector, the Chinese company Ganfeng continues to own the Bacanora lithium field, but its ability to exploit it continues to be paralyzed, following former President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador’s February 2023 initiative to nationalize Mexico’s lithium sector. Ganfeng is now in litigation over the issue. Stores specializing in Chinese merchandise have also expanded notably in Mexico’s retail sector, including not only informal shops in markets such as Tepito, but networks of brick-and-mortar stores such as China Market and Hogar China. These chains are expanding not only in Mexico City but around the country in cities such as Hidalgo, Puebla and Queretaro. Products from China exceeded 20 percent of all imports for the first time in 2024. There are concerns over whether such stores fully operate in conformity with Mexican tax and other laws. In July 2024, the Sheinbaum government symbolically raided and shut down China Mart, a three-story retail outlet for Chinese products in Plaza Izaga 89. China-Mexico commercial collaboration in general is reflected in its business councils. The China-Mexico Chamber (MexCham), under working President Victor Cadera, principally represents Mexican companies working in China, while the China Chamber of Commerce and Technology of Mexico, headed by Amipola Grijalva, is more focused on networking involving Chinese companies and their counterparts in Mexico. Academic and Media Engagement Mexican academic and intellectual engagement with China continues to expand. Mexico’s sixth Confucius Institute, providing Beijing-sanctioned instruction in Chinese language and culture, recently launched in the University of Guadalajara. The University of Veracruz in Jalapa opened a nongovernmental Center for China Studies, complementing others in Mexican public institutions, including in the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), the College of Mexico (one of the country’s oldest), the Autonomous University of Baja California in Tijuana, University of Guadalajara, and the Asia-Pacific (APEC) Studies Center in the University of Colima. China’s government reportedly provides 10-20 scholarships per year for Mexicans to study in China, in addition to countless scholarships for Mexican students coming directly from Chinese universities. China-based companies also provide sponsored training programs for Mexicans to study in China, such as Huawei’s “Seeds for the Future” program. Just within the context of its employment of Mexicans, Huawei may have brought as many as 100 Mexicans to its training center in Shenzhen in the past five years. As in other parts of the region, China also actively courts Mexican media outlets. The left-oriented journal Jornada regularly carries content from Xinhua. The more centrist Reforma reprints content from Chinese media. China’s recently departed ambassador, Zheng Run, was a featured regular columnist in Milenio. Indeed, Milenio reporter Alma Paola Wong, among others, received a sponsored trip to China, and other representatives of Milenio and other respected media outlets were brought to China by Huawei for a media technology demonstration. Conclusion Mexico’s relationship with China will continue to be shaped by the “strategic triangle” involving the Mexico-U.S. and China-U.S. relationships. Despite the caution exercised by the Sheinbaum administration, the multidimensional China-Mexico relationship continues to evolve through its own momentum. China, in practical terms, is not an “alternative” to the United States for Mexico, but for both good and bad, it will continue to be an important part of the dynamics shaping Mexico’s future. R.

Taoiseach Micheál Martin has led the tributes to the late businessman and sportsman Pat (PJ) Dineen who chaired Irish Steel, Bord na Móna and Bord Gáis, as well as playing cricket for Ireland on over twenty occasions. Mr Dineen (87) of Blackrock in Cork, but originally from Glasheen in the city, died on Thursday surrounded by his family “after a long and happy life.” He is survived by his wife Colette, sons Peter and Roger, daughter Linda as well as his brother Dick, grandchildren, son and daughter-in-law, extended family and friends. Mr Martin took time out of his trip to Brussels to issue a statement in which he said that Pat Dineen had made an “enormous impact on Irish industry, sport and public life.” “A great wit, with a keen business mind, Pat guided Bord Gáis, Irish Steel and Bord na Móna through some successful and challenging times. Pat retained his lifelong love of cricket, having been part of the Irish team that famously defeated the West Indies in 1969. My sympathies go to his wife Colette, children and wider family and many friends in his native Cork.” Cork Chamber of Commerce President, Rob Horgan, said that Pat was a “ a long-time friend and supporter of the business community. ” “He founded a very successful insurance company, Dineen Life & Pensions, in the 1960s, consolidating and expanding in the 1970s before it was later sold on. Later in his career, he brought this expertise to Bord Gáis, where he oversaw the construction of the Kinsale Head gasfield and pipeline, and also served as an executive chairman of Irish Steel, overseeing its transition from a loss-making company to a profitmaking enterprise and, ultimately, its sale. Our deepest condolences to his entire family and our thoughts are with them at this time.” Well known Cork auctioneer Dominic Daly said his late friend had led a rich and varied life and was a success at everything to turned his hand to over the years. “He was working for I think Standard Life (when we met) and I was in the wine business. He was very business orientated and gentlemanly. He was very in to cricket. And soccer – not as many people knew that. He was also very good at squash.” Mr Dineen’s life in business started in 1965 when he established his life and pensions company in Cork. The business grew rapidly and in 1972 he sold 40 per cent of the company to the merchant bank Charterhouse. The international insurance group Sedgewick acquired the Charterhouse stake a year later and the company became Sedgwick Dineen. He sold his stake in the company, which was valued at over £10 million, in 1994. Before setting up his own company he had worked for Norwich Union and Standard Life. During his time at Irish Steel, which he joined as executive chairman in 1993, he guided the company through several difficult years and its sale to Ispat International. He later told The Irish Times that the sale to the Indian firm had come down to the wire with Irish Steel coming “within eight hours of closure.” Mr Dineen was chairman of Bord Gáis from 1984 to 1989. During that time he oversaw the acquisition of the town gas companies throughout the State and the construction of the Kinsale Head gasfield and pipeline. Away from business he was a member of the legendary Irish cricket team which famously beat the powerful West Indies in 1969 at Sion Mills in Co Tyrone. Cork Cricket Club said he was a “true icon of Munster and Irish cricket.” “Pat captained the club on six occasions between 1963 and 1984, leaving an indelible mark both on and off the field. His contributions to the game and his club will not be forgotten.” Dolphin Rugby and Football Club said that they were “deeply saddened by” the death of their former member and player. Tributes were also paid to Mr Dineen by Munster Cricket and Cricket Leinster. He will lie in repose at Temple Hill Funeral Home in Boreenmanna Road in Cork on Friday from 5pm to 6pm. His requiem mass will take place on Saturday at 10am at St Joseph’s SMA Church in Blackrock in Cork City.

Title: Chinese anger at sale of Panama Canal ports to US investor highlights tensions between the two superpowers

Associate Professor in US History, University of Nottingham Maria Ryan has received funding from the British Academy. University of Nottingham provides funding as a founding partner of The Conversation UK. View all partners When Hong Kong-listed conglomerate CK Hutchison announced it was selling its two port concessions on the Panama Canal to a US consortium led by New York-based giant BlackRock, the Chinese government issued a strongly worded rebuke. Through government-backed newspaper Ta Kung Pao, Beijing accused the US of forcing the deal “through despicable means”, and claimed that if this was completed: “The United States will definitely use it for political purposes … China’s shipping and trade there will inevitably be subject to the United States.” CK Hutchison’s decision to sell its ports, which it has operated since 1997, to a US-led buyer came after the US president, Donald Trump, criticised Chinese influence over this strategically vital waterway. In his inaugural address, Trump claimed, falsely, that “China is operating the Panama Canal” and vowed “we’re taking it back”. In fact, data shows that the majority of traffic through the canal goes to or from the US. This has stoked fears in Beijing that US companies operating ports on the canal will do Washington’s bidding and potentially seek to restrict China’s access. Beijing’s angry response indicates the rivalry between the two great powers is deep and ongoing. While it is likely that this rivalry will continue to intensify under Trump, the president is unpredictable. Indeed, he sees unpredictability as a virtue – a way to keep advisers and foreign leaders on their toes. When asked last year whether he would support Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion, Trump gave his own twist on the longstanding US policy of “strategic ambiguity”, saying: “I don’t want to reveal my cards … I wouldn’t want to give away any negotiating abilities by giving information like that to any reporter.” This means there are multiple plausible outcomes for the US-China relationship in the second Trump administration. On the one hand, there is a very strong, bipartisan consensus in Washington that China poses a systemic, generational challenge to American power. Whereas Russia is viewed as a disruptor, China is a potential peer competitor that could build a new international order based on Beijing’s preferences and interests. Since Trump’s first term in office, the US has been aggressively waging a “tech war” on China to limit its technological and military development, by cutting off access to high-end semiconductors designed by US companies. This was intensified in the Biden years with new sanctions on Chinese tech companies, and the passage of the Chips and Science Act, designed to encourage the return of semiconductor manufacturing to the US. Defensive weapons sales to Taiwan had already been increased in Trump’s first term – and remained at high levels under Joe Biden. What Biden called “extreme competition” with China has become the main organising principle of US foreign policy. While Republican lawmakers have, so far, been willing to go along with Trump’s diplomacy when it comes to Russia, there is likely to be less tolerance of a similar approach to China. Unlike other US presidents, Trump does not seem to believe that alliances extend American power in the world – although he does still want the US to be the undisputed number one. In his second inaugural address, he vowed to “build the strongest military the world has ever seen”. Trump sees China as an economic adversary, one of the reasons for imposing punitive tariffs of 20% on all incoming goods. China has retaliated with tariffs of its own and and has proposed more restrictions on exports of rare earth minerals. These are vital components of semiconductors, electric batteries and many weapons – and the global market is dominated by China. The US State Department recently signalled a possible shift in policy towards Taiwan, removing the phrase “we do not support Taiwan independence” from its fact sheet on Taiwan in February. This irritated Beijing, which sees the island as an integral part of China. This subtle move away from the US’s longstanding “One China” policy – along with the tariffs and Trump’s hostility to alleged Chinese influence over the Panama Canal – suggests the continuation of a hostile, competitive approach to China. That said, as Trump’s recent diplomacy with Russia and his comments about absorbing Greenland showed, he is not afraid to upend the established norms of US foreign policy. He enjoys provoking the “globalist” foreign policy establishment. He lauds his own deal-making abilities, and would not want to fight a war with China over Taiwan. Trump is attracted to “strongman” leaders and claims to have “a great relationship with President Xi”. He achieves his goals by taking maximalist positions (for example, the punitive tariffs) which he uses to extract concessions. At a recent press conference, Trump stated: “I see so many things saying we don’t want China in this country. That’s not right. We want them to invest in the United States. That’s good. That’s a lot of money coming in.” Trump is well aware the US is heavily dependent on imported semiconductors from the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation (TSMC) – the world’s leading chip manufacturer – and has repeatedly accused Taiwan of “stealing” the US semiconductor industry. He recently took credit for TSMC’s announcement that it would invest a further US$100 billion (£77 billion) in three chip factories in Arizona, declaring that production of vital semiconductors inside the US was “a matter of national security”. But it will take years for TSMC’s investments to come to fruition in terms of aiding US self-sufficiency in chip manufacture. In the meantime, it is not out of the question that Trump could seek a deal with China that guarantees US access to imported chips from Taiwan, in return for China absorbing the island peacefully. Given the historic importance of Taiwan to Beijing, this could appeal. Avoiding war could also be popular with Trump voters who want to put “America first” without getting embroiled in foreign wars. Although the hawkish China consensus is firmly embedded in Washington, its continuation is not guaranteed while the mercurial Trump is at the helm.

Title: TRON ETF rumors heat up with Justin Sun’s latest move – Why?

Justin Sun hints at Tron ETF as USDD grows, TRX shows potential but faces challenges. Justin Sun is in the spotlight again, this time with hints of a possible ETF for TRON [TRX]. Along with the recent expansion of TRX to the Solana blockchain and the ongoing growth of its algorithmic stablecoin, USDD, TRX seems to be working towards greater institutional involvement and wider market integration. Amid market uncertainty and consolidation, TRX focuses on regulatory compliance, cross-chain integration, and stablecoin development. This strategy positions TRX to capitalize on the next phase of crypto adoption. In a recent social media post, TRON founder Justin Sun hinted at a TRON ETF, prompting speculation about whether TRX might soon join the ranks of regulated crypto financial products. The timing is notable: with Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs already approved, traditional finance is warming to crypto’s more established assets. Source: X BlackRock and Fidelity are actively advancing new applications, and TRON could soon follow suit. While no official filing has been confirmed, Sun’s hints at institutional interest suggest ongoing behind-the-scenes efforts. If a TRX ETF becomes a reality, it would represent a significant step in TRON’s transition from a niche project to mainstream financial markets. TRON’s USDD stablecoin is gaining momentum, recently surpassing a $270 million market cap. Amid heightened scrutiny of algorithmic stablecoins, USDD’s resilience stands out, particularly in emerging markets where dollar-pegged assets are vital for daily transactions. Sun remains committed to expanding USDD across multiple blockchain networks, extending its reach beyond TRON’s ecosystem. As one of the most widely used innovations in crypto, stablecoins highlight TRX’s broader goal of achieving real-world utility rather than merely speculative interest. With rising global demand for stable, censorship-resistant assets, USDD’s growth could play a pivotal role in shaping TRX’s next chapter. At press time, TRX was trading at $0.233, showing signs of a modest recovery following a sharp drop earlier this month. The daily RSI stood at 54.45, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions. This indicates a potential for further upside, albeit cautious. OBV remained relatively flat around 97.31 billion, showing weak conviction from buyers despite the recent bounce. Source: TradingView TRX’s price action shows a minor higher low, signaling potential short-term bullish momentum. However, without a significant volume increase or an RSI breakout above 60, any move beyond the $0.24 resistance level may struggle to hold. Traders should monitor for a confirmed breakout or an uptick in OBV to validate the possibility of sustained upward momentum.

Time Published: 2025-03-21T14:00:00Z

Catch up on select AI news and developments from the past week or so (in no particular order): Gemini adds Canvas document editing and Audio Overviews. Google has introduced two new features for Gemini: Canvas and Audio Overviews. Canvas allows users to draft, edit, and refine documents and code within Gemini, with integration to Google Docs for collaboration. The tool also supports code generation for apps and scripts with real-time previews. Audio Overviews, previously part of NotebookLM, are now available to summarize and present information via audio. Both tools are part of Gemini’s broader push into productivity and multimodal interfaces. Importance for marketers: These enhancements support AI-driven content creation and code development, offering marketers more efficient tools for ideation, copy generation, and automation workflows. Study shows AI-generated meme captions score higher on average. A study comparing meme captions written by humans, AI, and human-AI teams found that captions by GPT-4o scored higher on average for humor, creativity, and shareability. AI consistently produced broadly appealing memes, though the funniest individual captions were still human-made. Human-AI teams created more ideas efficiently but felt less ownership. The study highlights AI’s role in boosting productivity while also noting emotional and qualitative trade-offs in creative collaboration. Importance for marketers: AI can increase output and audience resonance in content creation, but marketers should balance efficiency with human insight to maximize creative impact and emotional connection. Stability AI unveils model to turn images into 3D videos. Stability AI released Stable Virtual Camera, a new model that converts up to 32 images into videos with simulated 3D depth and dynamic camera paths. The tool supports formats up to 1,000 frames and multiple aspect ratios. It’s currently available under a research-only, noncommercial license. Though early versions show limitations with complex textures and scenes, the model enables users to create immersive content without traditional 3D tools. Importance for marketers: This model presents new creative options for immersive advertising and storytelling, enabling brands to produce 3D-like video content from 2D assets at lower cost and complexity. Mistral AI releases small model that outperforms GPT-4o Mini. Mistral AI has launched Mistral Small 3.1, an open-source model with 24 billion parameters that matches or exceeds GPT-4o Mini’s performance. The model processes text and images, supports 128k token contexts, and runs efficiently on modest hardware. Mistral is promoting digital sovereignty by making the model accessible under an Apache 2.0 license. The company also highlighted tools like Mistral OCR and Saba. Importance for marketers: Open, efficient AI models like Mistral Small 3.1 offer cost-effective alternatives for marketing applications, enabling on-device AI integration without reliance on large cloud-based proprietary platforms. Baidu unveils two new AI models to rival US competitors. Baidu introduced two new AI models, including ERNIE X1, which it claims rivals DeepSeek R1 at half the cost. The model offers advanced reasoning and autonomous tool use. Baidu also launched ERNIE 4.5, with strong multimodal and high-EQ capabilities. These models aim to bolster Baidu’s position in the global AI race as Chinese firms compete with US tech giants. Importance for marketers: Competitive advances from global AI players mean more options and price competition for AI-driven tools, offering marketers new opportunities in content creation, personalization, and regional expansion. Adobe launches agentic AI platform and prebuilt marketing agents. Adobe introduced agentic AI to its Experience Platform, offering 10 prebuilt agents for tasks like audience optimization, personalization, and content production. The new platform integrates with GenStudio Foundation and Brand Concierge for seamless campaign management. Adobe also announced data-sharing partnerships with AWS, Microsoft, SAP, and others to improve AI model training across platforms. The launch was announced during Adobe Summit in Las Vegas. Importance for marketers: Adobe's AI tools automate key marketing functions at scale. The interoperability and prebuilt agents help marketers streamline personalization, campaign planning, and content generation across ecosystems. Anthropic reportedly working on voice capabilities for Claude. Anthropic plans to introduce voice interaction for its Claude AI assistant, according to company executive Mike Krieger. The feature is being prototyped for desktop use and could become a more natural interface for users. Anthropic has discussed potential partnerships with Amazon and ElevenLabs to support this capability. No launch date has been announced. Importance for marketers: Voice-enabled AI offers more intuitive user interaction. Marketers may explore voice-based engagement tools, conversational commerce, or hands-free content creation using Claude once this feature launches. AI-powered search engines found to cite incorrect sources 60% of the time. A Columbia Journalism Review study revealed that generative AI search tools provided incorrect citations in over 60% of tests. Eight platforms, including ChatGPT and Perplexity, were evaluated using 1,600 queries. AI tools often generated plausible but incorrect answers rather than declining to respond. Some also ignored publisher restrictions. Paid versions frequently delivered more errors than free ones. Researchers raised concerns about growing reliance on these tools for news and research. Importance for marketers: Marketers relying on AI-driven search tools should vet information carefully. Misinformation risks can damage brand credibility and misguide strategic decisions based on flawed AI output. Microsoft partners with Inait to develop brain-like AI models. Microsoft has partnered with Swiss startup Inait to create cognitive AI systems modeled on mammalian brain reasoning. The technology integrates symbolic reasoning with neural networks, aiming for adaptive, energy-efficient systems. Potential applications include finance, robotics, and enterprise tools. The partnership builds on 20 years of digital neuroscience research and will use Azure for deployment. Importance for marketers: Brain-inspired AI could yield more nuanced customer insights, smarter automation, and faster learning systems—advancing personalization and predictive marketing capabilities. OpenAI and Elon Musk agree to expedited trial over for-profit status. OpenAI and Elon Musk have agreed to fast-track their legal dispute over OpenAI’s transition to a for-profit model. The case will proceed to trial in autumn. Musk, who co-founded OpenAI in 2015, alleges the organization deviated from its original nonprofit mission. OpenAI counters that the move is necessary to secure investment and stay competitive. The trial outcome may influence OpenAI’s ability to raise capital. Importance for marketers: The trial outcome could impact OpenAI’s growth and product strategy, which may influence future access to or pricing of tools like ChatGPT used in marketing and content generation. Cisco expands Webex with AI agents to enhance customer service. Cisco announced new AI Agent and AI Assistant tools for its Webex Contact Center at Enterprise Connect. These features help manage dynamic conversations, provide live recommendations, transcribe calls, and summarize interactions. The AI Agent can automate tasks like booking flights and integrates with corporate systems. Cisco also added AirPlay support for Microsoft Teams Rooms. Importance for marketers: Cisco’s AI-driven customer service enhancements offer marketers better CX data, more responsive service tools, and deeper insights into customer behavior during live support interactions. OpenAI to beta test ChatGPT Connectors for Drive and Slack. OpenAI will begin beta testing ChatGPT Connectors, allowing users to connect Slack and Google Drive accounts to ChatGPT. The tool can access and respond to queries based on synced content, respecting file and channel permissions. It supports documents, presentations, and spreadsheets, but does not analyze images or Slack DMs. Future integrations include SharePoint and Box. Importance for marketers: These integrations make ChatGPT a more powerful internal assistant, streamlining content discovery, campaign planning, and team collaboration across popular workplace platforms. Meta requires disclosure of AI use in Canadian political ads. Meta will now require advertisers to disclose if political or social issue ads in Canada use AI to create or alter images, videos, or audio. This includes content depicting realistic but fake events or individuals. The rule aims to reduce misinformation ahead of Canada’s federal elections. Meta has also added tools to label AI-generated content and expanded restrictions on political ad use of generative AI. Importance for marketers: Transparency requirements for AI-generated content are increasing. Marketers must prepare for more regulatory scrutiny and adapt ad practices to comply with platform and government policies on synthetic media. Gemini web access now available without Google sign-in. Google’s Gemini AI assistant is now accessible via web browsers without requiring a Google Account. Visitors to gemini.google.com can use the chat interface in incognito mode, though advanced features like model selection, file uploads, and chat history still require login. Signed-out users are limited to Gemini 2.0 Flash. The Android app continues to require account login. This change aligns the Gemini web experience with Google Search, emphasizing accessibility. Importance for marketers: Easier access to Gemini without sign-in lowers barriers for user adoption and engagement, expanding opportunities for marketers to test or promote AI-powered experiences and tools. Snap’s AR Spectacles gain GPS navigation and virtual keyboard. Snap has added new features to its fifth-generation AR Spectacles, including GPS and GNSS navigation, improved hand tracking, and an AR keyboard for smartphone-free text input. New AR Lenses, such as NavigatAR and Path Pioneer, enable directional arrows and walking tours. Niantic has updated Peridot Beyond for multiplayer use, and developers can implement leaderboards. The keyboard features numeric layouts and a refined grab gesture. However, the devices remain limited to developers, available through Lens Studio at $99/month with a one-year commitment. Importance for marketers: These updates expand possibilities for location-based AR experiences and branded interactive environments, particularly in tourism, gaming, and retail. Nvidia and xAI join consortium to fund US AI infrastructure. Nvidia and Elon Musk’s xAI have joined the AI Infrastructure Partnership, a consortium backed by Microsoft, BlackRock, and MGX, aiming to invest $100 billion into AI infrastructure. The group is focused on funding data centers and energy facilities essential for AI development. Members include GE Vernova and NextEra Energy, with investment targeting US and OECD nations. Nvidia will remain a technical advisor. Importance for marketers: Massive infrastructure investments signal continued expansion of AI capabilities.

Photo Credit: x/ @hhtbzayed As the US shapes crypto laws, the UAE advances in Web3 regulations This week, the US hosted UAE National Security Adviser Sheikh Tahnoon Bin Zayed Al Nahyan to discuss technological cooperation, energy, and investment opportunities. During his visit, he met with key officials from President Trump's administration, including White House crypto czar David Sacks, where cryptocurrency regulation was a key topic. While the US is still shaping its crypto laws, the UAE is among the first nations to have established regulations. Sheikh Tahnoon Bin Zayed Al Nahyan and David Sacks have initiated discussions on expanding digital currencies, particularly within international financial systems. They also explored upcoming investment opportunities at the intersection of crypto and artificial intelligence (AI). “As technological advancements accelerate, fostering collaboration and adopting forward-looking strategies remain essential pillars for driving sustainable growth and achieving long-term impact,” a post by Sheikh Tahnoon Zayed Al Nahyan said on X.

Earlier this month, MGX acquired a minority stake in Binance for $2 billion (roughly Rs. 17,403 crore). As per reports, MGX has committed $7 billion (roughly Rs. 60,209 crore) to President Trump's ambitious Stargate project, that aims to build high power AI data centres across the US. OpenAI, Nvidia, Microsoft, and SoftBank are other participants in the $500 billion (roughly Rs. 43,00,668 crore) project. Satya Nadella (Microsoft), Larry Fink (BlackRock), and Jensen Huang (Nvidia) also met with MGX chief Sheikh Tahnoon Zayed Al Nahyan to discuss the US's AI initiatives. Al Nahyan later shared glimpses of the meeting on X. I discussed with Larry Fink, Satya Nadella, and Jensen Huang our shared commitment to harnessing AI's transformative potential to accelerate global growth and drive groundbreaking innovation.With new partners joining the AI Infrastructure Partnership (AIP), we are expanding our… pic.twitter.com/YW34SzMMRF Earlier this week, President Trump hosted Zayed Al Nahyan at the White House alongside senior federal officials. The 47th US President later shared the update on Truth Social. “Discussions included ways for our countries to increase our partnership for the advancing of our economic and technological futures,” President Trump posted. At present, US SEC's Crypto Task Force is designing a regulatory framework to govern the crypto sector. During the recently held Crypto Summit at the White House, President Trump directed the Task Force to present its proposed laws by the end of August. The UAE has been implementing Web3 regulations for over two years. Key milestones include the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM) framework, which regulates crypto trading platforms, and Dubai's Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority (VARA), that oversees virtual assets in the region. With its advanced regulatory framework, the UAE has become a key advisor for nations like the US seeking guidance on crypto policies. In January, Malaysian Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim met with UAE officials to discuss the formulation of a supportive crypto policy framework.

Title: Another popular crypto X account hacked, spreads fake Ripple-SWIFT partnership news

Watcher Guru hack reveals security gaps on X as fake XRP news sparks turmoil in crypto community. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Crypto-focused media outlet Watcher Guru confirmed that its official X account was hacked to promote a fake report claiming Ripple and SWIFT were close to a deal to use XRP in global payment systems. The unauthorized post went live on March 21 at 2:05 A.M. UTC. It falsely stated that Ripple would soon partner with SWIFT and that billions of XRP had been locked in escrow as liquidity reserves. The post quickly gained attention and sparked excitement in the XRP community, with many users believing it was true. For context, Bitrue, a prominent pro-XRP crypto exchange, mistakenly shared the fake news, amplifying the confusion. Shortly after, Watcher Guru clarified the situation, confirming that the post did not come from their team. According to the media outlet: “Our X account has been hacked and the previous post (now deleted) was posted by a hacker. We have 2FA enabled and have taken extreme measures to avoid hacks.” Due to automation, the same false report was also shared on Watcher Guru’s other social media accounts, including Telegram, Facebook, and Discord. The team said the reposting bot pushed the content to all channels before the issue was spotted. Meanwhile, Watcher Guru stated that the attacker had blocked Ripple’s official X account and that of its CEO Brad Garlinghouse to “presumably slow down a ‘false report’ response from their team.” This marks the second major breach of a prominent crypto platform on X. Earlier this week, DB News’ X account was hacked and used to spread a fake report about Donald Trump’s TRUMP memecoin and a false BlackRock ETF filing for Hyperliquid. Watcher Guru believes the breach may have started weeks earlier as its team had received a suspicious X link through Telegram on March 5. According to the team: “We noticed the link was formatted in a strange way. It was an official X Developer staging site using X’s official domain, however it included a specific path and ‘token’ query string which X links do not normally have.” Watcher Guru stated that its team flagged the link and contacted X’s Head of Cybersecurity, Christopher Stanley, but received no reply. Watcher Guru continued that while it cannot confirm the link that caused the hack, the firm noted that its breach resembled that of DB News, another crypto media outlet. According to Watcher Guru, its account, like DB News, had two-factor authentication enabled, no connected apps, and no API tokens were used to post the false information. It concluded: “At this time, we have not yet determined the exact source or method behind the hack. All unauthorized posts have been removed, and our account has been secured. We are contacting X for further clarification.” Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

Title: Real-World Assets Cross $10 Billion in Total Value Locked: DeFiLlama

Real-world assets (RWAs) are now a $10 billion category, according to data curated by DeFiLlama, with Maker, BlackRock's BUIDL and Ethena's USDtb each accounting for more than $1 billion in total value locked (TVL). Of the three, USDtb — a stablecoin designed to contrast with Ethena's USDe — has had the fastest growth, adding over 1,000% in TVL in the last month. USDtb is backed by tokenized BlackRock money-market fund shares whereas USDe uses crypto-assets and perpetual futures strategies for crypto-driven yields. CoinDesk previously reported that Treasury-backed tokens reached a record $4.2 billion market cap in the first quarter, driven by growth in Ondo Finance's OUSG and USDY tokens, BlackRock and Securitize's BUIDL, Franklin Templeton's BENJI and Superstate's USTB. Treasury-backed tokens dominate, according to data aggregator RWA.xyz. The next highest category, tokenized commodities, comes in at $1.26 billion, with Paxos Gold leading with TVL of just over $500 million. Analysts say this reflects investor preference for safer assets amid bearish crypto sentiment, with T-bills outperforming what's offered for yield with major DeFi protocols like Compound.

Title: The climate movement is talking about carbon all wrong, a new book argues
URL: http://grist.org/language/paul-hawken-book-climate-movement-carbon/
Time Published: 2025-03-21T08:15:00Z
Full Content:
Δ A nonprofit, independent media organization dedicated to telling stories of climate solutions and a just future. Δ Burning oil, gas, and coal — literal fossil fuels, made from the compressed remains of ancient plants and plankton — has released carbon into Earth’s atmosphere, where it traps heat and alters the climate. That process has caused massive destruction and loss of life, and it will continue to do so. As a result, carbon came to be seen as something to “fight,” “combat,” and “capture.” Paul Hawken, the author of the new book Carbon: The Book of Life, argues that the climate movement is thinking about its work, and messaging, all wrong. “Those who call carbon a pollutant might want to lay down their word processor,” Hawken writes. Carbon, he notes, is after all the building block of life, the animating force behind trees, rhinos, eyelashes, hormones, bamboo, and so much more. Without it, Earth would just be a lonely, dead rock. So much for decarbonizing. Hawken has come to believe that treating carbon as something to tackle, liquefy, and pump into geological formations not only reflects the same mindset that caused climate change in the first place, but also further alienates people from the living world. There is no “climate crisis,” he argues, but a crisis of human thinking and behavior that’s degrading the soil, wiping out entire species, and changing the weather faster than people can adapt. “From a planetary view,” he writes in Carbon, “the warming atmosphere is a response, an adjustment, a teaching.” The book records a shift in his thinking. In 2017, Hawken published Drawdown: The Most Comprehensive Plan Ever Proposed to Reverse Global Warming, a book that ranked 100 climate solutions by how much they could reduce carbon emissions, from refrigerant leaks to food waste. The nonprofit Project Drawdown, which he launched, continues to implement these kinds of fixes around the world. But now, Hawken is forgoing straightforward metrics to focus on what he sees as a deeper cultural problem. “The living world is a complex interactive system and doesn’t lend itself to simple solutions,” he said. Grist thanks its sponsors. Become one. To support our nonprofit environmental journalism, please consider disabling your ad-blocker to allow ads on Grist. Here's How The new book frames carbon as a flow — a cycle that moves through the atmosphere, oceans, soil, with the element absorbed by growing plants and exhaled in every animal breath. Hawken’s book is a lesson in what’s sometimes called “unlearning,” or letting go of old assumptions, like the idea that nature is something to fix or control. The book explores ways to repair a broken relationship with the natural world, drawing inspiration from Indigenous cultures and new scientific discoveries. Hawken marvels at how much remains unknown about carbon, which he dubs “the most mysterious element of all.” The book’s poetic language offers a stark contrast to the warlike terms climate advocates tend to use to describe carbon. Hawken argues that the typical metaphors are not only inaccurate — how exactly do you battle an element? — but also provide fuel for right-wing narratives that carbon has been unfairly demonized. Last week, E&E News reported that the Trump administration is planning a federal report making the case that a warming world would be a good thing, a pretext for weakening climate regulations. “Carbon dioxide is not an evil gas,” David Legates, a former Trump official, said in a recent video put out by the Heartland Institute, a conservative think tank. “Rather, it’s a gas beneficial to life on Earth. It’ll increase temperatures slightly, and warmer temperatures are certainly better than colder temperatures.” Hawken wants a broad shift in how people talk about the natural world, though, not just a rethinking of the climate movement’s metaphors. He points to how financial institutions increasingly refer to nature as a commodity. In January, BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, declared “natural capital” an investment priority. In February, Goldman Sachs launched a “biodiversity bond fund” turning ecosystems into investment products. The jargon used in scientific reports and global climate conferences also creates a sense of detachment that dulls the living things it refers to. Hawken describes the word “biodiversity” as “a bloodless term” and “carbon neutrality” as an absurd “biophysical impossibility.” Grist thanks its sponsors. Become one.

Here's How “We are numbed by the science, puzzled by jargon, paralyzed by predictions, confused about what actions to take, stressed as we scramble to care for our family, or simply impoverished, overworked, and tired,” Hawken writes. “Most of humanity doesn’t talk about climate change because we do not know what to say.” Even plainspoken terms like “nature” are suspect, in Hawken’s view: The concept only seems to exist to mark a separation between humans and the rest of the world. He points out that the Chicham language of the Achuar people in the Amazon doesn’t have a word for nature, nor do other Indigenous languages. “Such words would only be needed if the Achuar experienced nature as distinct from the self,” he writes. English, by contrast, he describes as a “rootless” language, borrowing terms from so many places that it struggles to teach the kind of deep, reciprocal relationships that are born from living in one place and caring for it over many generations. Hawken hopes to mend that separation by helping people discover the flow of carbon in their daily lives and kindle a sense of wonder about it. Carbon delves into mind-bending scientific discoveries about the kind of marvels that carbon makes possible. Bees, with their two-milligram brains, appear able to count, learn by observation, feel pain and pleasure, and even recognize their own knowledge. The rye plant senses the world around it with more than 14 million roots and root hairs, a network that one plant neurobiologist described as a type of brain. Hawken’s book is a reminder that carbon — despite all the problems caused by releasing too much of it into the atmosphere — is actually a gift. The goal of Carbon isn’t to map out a plan for saving the Earth, but to rekindle a sense of relationship with it. Where Hawken lives in California, his community recently restored a salmon stream, breaking down a concrete barrier under a bridge that had blocked the fish on their final journey up the stream to spawn. “The core of it is about care, and kindness, and connection, and compassion, and generosity,” Hawken said. “That’s where regeneration starts.” A message from Grist is the only award-winning newsroom focused on exploring equitable solutions to climate change.

Title: BlackRock thinks Bitcoin could thrive in a recession – Will it?

Market sentiment on Bitcoin’s ability to hedge against economic pressure remains mixed. Bitcoin [BTC], at the time of writing, was trading at $85,387, up 2.30% in the last 24 hours. However, market sentiment remains divided. In fact, inflows have dropped by 54%, from 58.6K BTC/day to 26.9K BTC/day. Despite this, Blackrock’s Robbie Mitchnick believes Bitcoin could thrive, even in a recession. He pointed out that Bitcoin benefits from fiscal stimulus, lower interest rates, and monetary easing – All common during economic downturns. Additionally, fears of social unrest may push more people towards Bitcoin as a hedge. As Q2 unfolds, Bitcoin’s role as a safe haven will be put to the ultimate test. Will it prove its resilience? Through its iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT), Blackrock has established itself as a major institutional player in the Bitcoin market, holding 570,582 BTC in its treasury. This includes a notable addition of 22,076 BTC this year alone. In a recent interview, Robbie Mitchnick, Blackrock’s Head of Digital Assets, attributed Bitcoin’s decline below $80k on 10 March to “premature expectations” around the economic outlook. Source: TradingView (BTC/USDT) According to AMBCrypto, key factors include early rate cut speculation, Bitcoin’s evolving role as a strategic reserve, and insufficient awareness of the U.S debt crisis. Further compounding these pressures are Trump’s strict tariff plans. While the short-term market reaction led to the sharp “dip,” Blackrock’s $218.10 million in inflows – its monthly high – has reinforced Mitchnick’s thesis. The likelihood of a U.S recession has returned to the forefront after the FOMC meeting, with Chairman Jerome Powell adopting a “wait-and-see” stance. Essentially, the possibility of a recession cannot be entirely ruled out just yet. A key bullish signal during a recession is economic slowdown. Weak labor data dampens aggregate demand, prompting the Federal Reserve to inject liquidity via interest rate cuts. This liquidity influx often supports risk assets like Bitcoin in the medium term. However, while Blackrock maintains a bullish position, a recession typically unfolds through a brief cycle of declining demand, rising unemployment, and market corrections. This could put Bitcoin’s safe-haven narrative to the test. Bitcoin’s 22% decline from its all-time high of $109k could potentially signal the onset of a larger market correction, with more volatility ahead. This, unless Trump’s economic retest triggers a shift in market conditions. In February, inflation saw a month-on-month decline of 0.2%, dipping from 3% in January. Source: Trading Economics This easing inflationary pressure has led the Fed to halt rate hikes, though the possibility of further hikes remains on the horizon. Blackrock’s bullish thesis hinges on a more pronounced market flush-out – A sign that a deeper correction may be required before a bull market can truly materialize.

Title: The stablecoin trap: How financial surveillance is already here

The current U.S. financial system already operates as a digital control grid, with 92% of dollars existing only in databases, transactions monitored without warrants, and access to money revocable at any time. Government agencies like the IRS, NSA and Treasury collect and analyze financial data with minimal oversight. Stablecoins, such as Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC), are not decentralized but controlled by major financial institutions. Proposed legislation like the STABLE Act and GENIUS Act enshrine financial surveillance, requiring strict KYC tracking on all transactions. A total ofÂ 134 countries, representing 98% of global GDP, are exploring Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). The European Central Bank plans to launch a digital euro by 2025, while Canadaâs leadership aligns with the World Economic Forum to advance a digital Canadian dollar. The ultimate goal is to tokenize all assets â stocks, bonds, real estate and commodities â under a global ledger, enabling governments to monitor and program transactions for compliance with policies like carbon limits or social credit scores. Privacy-focused cryptocurrencies like Monero (XMR) and Zano (ZANO) offer resistance to censorship and untraceable transactions. The fight for financial sovereignty is not about preventing future CBDCs but confronting the existing surveillance system and reclaiming privacy.

Privacy-focused cryptocurrencies like Monero (XMR) and Zano (ZANO) offer resistance to censorship and untraceable transactions. The fight for financial sovereignty is not about preventing future CBDCs but confronting the existing surveillance system and reclaiming privacy. The debate over Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) has dominated headlines, with fears of a dystopian future where governments monitor and control every financial transaction. But what if the dystopia is already here? A closer look at the current financial system reveals that the surveillance state isnât coming â itâs already in place. The rise of stablecoins â cryptocurrencies pegged to traditional assets like the U.S. dollar â has been hailed as a bridge between the volatile world of crypto and the stability of fiat currency. However, beneath the surface, these digital assets are becoming a backdoor to total financial control, enabling governments and corporations to monitor, restrict and even revoke access to money with the click of a button. The illusion of financial freedom The U.S. financial system is already a digital control grid. According to Patrick Wood, Editor at the Brownstone Institute, âThe battle isnât about stopping a future CBDCâitâs about recognizing the financial surveillance system that already exists. Your financial sovereignty is already under attack, and the last off-ramps are disappearing.â Consider these facts: 92% of all U.S. dollars exist only as entries in databases. Your transactions are monitored by government agenciesâwithout warrants. Your access to money can be revoked at any time with a keystroke. The Federal Reserve processes over $4 trillion daily through its Oracle database system, while commercial banks impose programmable restrictions on what you can buy and how you can spend your own money. The IRS, NSA and Treasury Department collect and analyze financial data without meaningful oversight, weaponizing money as a tool of control. The stablecoin Trojan Horse While President Trumpâs Executive Order 14178 ostensibly bans CBDCs, his administration is quietly advancing stablecoin legislation that would hand digital currency control to the same banking cartel that owns the Federal Reserve. The STABLE Act and GENIUS Act donât protect financial privacyâthey enshrine financial surveillance into law, requiring strict Know Your Customer (KYC) tracking on every transaction. âThis isnât defeating digital tyranny â itâs rebranding it,â warns Aaron Day, author of "The Stablecoin Trap: The Backdoor to Total Financial Control." Stablecoins like Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC) are already under the control of major financial institutions. Tether, with a $140 billion market cap, is managed by Tether Limited, with reserves held by Cantor Fitzgerald. USDC, the second-largest stablecoin, is issued by Circle Internet Financial and backed by Goldman Sachs and BlackRock. These stablecoins are not decentralized; they are corporate-controlled assets that can be frozen, blacklisted, or seized at any moment. The global push for digital control The U.S. is not alone in its pursuit of financial surveillance. Globally, 134 countries are actively exploring CBDCs, representing 98% of global GDP. Even with Trumpâs ban on CBDCs, the global race for digital currencies is accelerating. In the European Union, the European Central Bank (ECB) is pressing forward with its digital euro, targeting a rollout by October 2025. ECB President Christine Lagarde has stated, âWe are on track to introduce the digital euro by October this year, offering a secure and programmable complement to cash that ensures financial inclusion while maintaining privacy standards.â Meanwhile, Canadaâs new Prime Minister, Mark Carney, a former Governor of the Bank of England, is pushing for a digital Canadian dollar.

The endgame: A global digital ledger The ultimate goal is not just to digitize money but to tokenize all assetsâstocks, bonds, real estate and even commoditiesâunder a global ledger. This system, known as a Regulated Liability Network (RLN), would enable governments and central banks to monitor and program every financial transaction, ensuring compliance with policies like carbon limits or social credit scores. âThe endgame isnât just controlling our money â itâs digitizing all our assets under a global ledger with the same tracking and programmability as CBDCs,â says Day. The time to act is now The battle for financial privacy and autonomy is not about stopping a future CBDCâitâs about confronting the surveillance system already in place. Privacy coins like Monero (XMR) and Zano (ZANO) offer a way out, providing untraceable transactions and resistance to censorship. âPrivacy isnât a luxuryâitâs a tool for self-reliance,â says Day. âWithout privacy coins, every payment and asset risks being tracked or restricted.â As the walls close in on financial freedom, the time for complacency has passed.

The STABLE Act and GENIUS Act donât protect financial privacyâthey enshrine financial surveillance into law, requiring strict Know Your Customer (KYC) tracking on every transaction. âThis isnât defeating digital tyranny â itâs rebranding it,â warns Aaron Day, author of "The Stablecoin Trap: The Backdoor to Total Financial Control." Stablecoins like Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC) are already under the control of major financial institutions. Tether, with a $140 billion market cap, is managed by Tether Limited, with reserves held by Cantor Fitzgerald. USDC, the second-largest stablecoin, is issued by Circle Internet Financial and backed by Goldman Sachs and BlackRock. These stablecoins are not decentralized; they are corporate-controlled assets that can be frozen, blacklisted, or seized at any moment. The global push for digital control The U.S. is not alone in its pursuit of financial surveillance. Globally, 134 countries are actively exploring CBDCs, representing 98% of global GDP. Even with Trumpâs ban on CBDCs, the global race for digital currencies is accelerating. In the European Union, the European Central Bank (ECB) is pressing forward with its digital euro, targeting a rollout by October 2025. ECB President Christine Lagarde has stated, âWe are on track to introduce the digital euro by October this year, offering a secure and programmable complement to cash that ensures financial inclusion while maintaining privacy standards.â Meanwhile, Canadaâs new Prime Minister, Mark Carney, a former Governor of the Bank of England, is pushing for a digital Canadian dollar. Carneyâs alignment with the World Economic Forum (WEF) underscores his support for CBDCs as tools for financial innovation and control. The endgame: A global digital ledger The ultimate goal is not just to digitize money but to tokenize all assetsâstocks, bonds, real estate and even commoditiesâunder a global ledger. This system, known as a Regulated Liability Network (RLN), would enable governments and central banks to monitor and program every financial transaction, ensuring compliance with policies like carbon limits or social credit scores. âThe endgame isnât just controlling our money â itâs digitizing all our assets under a global ledger with the same tracking and programmability as CBDCs,â says Day. The time to act is now The battle for financial privacy and autonomy is not about stopping a future CBDCâitâs about confronting the surveillance system already in place.

Business FILE PHOTO: The entrance of the Balboa Port is pictured after Hong Kong's CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd 0001.HK agreed to sell its interests in a key Panama Canal port operator to a BlackRock Inc-backed consortium, amid pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to curb China's influence in the region, in Panama City, Panama, March 4, 2025. REUTERS/Enea Lebrun/File Photo HONG KONG :Shares of CK Hutchison fell on Friday after the telecoms-to-retail conglomerate reported weak earnings and dividends and said its operating environment would be volatile. Underlying profit for the group, which is having to contend with displeasure from Beijing over the sale of its ports business, slid 11 per cent of HK$20.8 billion ($2.7 billion) last year, slightly short of expectations. Its final dividend was cut to HK$1.514 per share from HK$1.775 for 2023. Shares in the company lost 1.9 per cent in early Hong Kong trade. The company has agreed to sell its ports business to a BlackRock-led consortium, including assets near the strategically important Panama Canal. The deal is expected to garner the firm more than $19 billion in cash but has been criticised by Beijing. CK Hutchison made no mention of the ports deal in its earnings statement, although it said "geopolitical and trade tensions have ... risen significantly." "The operating environment for the Group's businesses is expected to be both volatile and unpredictable," it said in the statement. It added that it will constrain capital spending and new investment and focus on stringent cash flow management.

More Info Donald Trump’s second presidency has unquestionably upended the energy world—and the energy investment world. With the IRA in deep freeze and rollbacks of various climate change-related regulation, some of the biggest players in financial markets are feeling the heat. Hedge funds with a focus on energy have found themselves in a juggling act on a tightrope. Bloomberg wrote this week that a lot of money managers were scrambling to strike the right balance between investors who were still insistent that emission-cutting commitments were priority number one and those who are accepting energy reality for what it is and seeking to replace those commitments with profits. Some pension funds in northern Europe, for instance, were discussing a pullout from the United States because of the Trump administration’s dismissal of the climate change fight, which those pension funds’ managements see as ignoring a substantial future investment risk, Bloomberg reported. Interestingly, British funds are doing the opposite, riding the wave of reprioritization to keep those investors who are in the game to make money rather than save the planet. Some specific examples provided by Bloomberg include a Dutch pension fund, DME, that is reviewing a $5-billion mandate with Blackrock because its management feels the U.S. financial giant has stopped taking its transition ambitions seriously, jeopardizing the Dutch pensioners’ money. As the fund put it, “BlackRock’s diminishing ambitions in responsible and sustainable investing” were threatening the $5 billion. Related: Chinese EVs Surge in Global Markets Interestingly, BlackRock is also the central character of another investment review noted by Bloomberg, this time for its too big of a focus on the energy transition, as perceived by the investment fund—the state pension fund of Indiana. Because of that perception, which is the exact opposite of DME’s perception of the same investment bank, the pension fund of Indiana pulled its money out of BlackRock and put it in State Street. The Bloomberg report comes days after the founder of a hedge fund specifically set up to invest in the energy transition declared the transition dead, “for now.” Speaking to Bloomberg again, Nishant Gupta, founder of Kanou Capital, said that “The whole sector — solar, wind, hydrogen, fuel cells — anything clean is dead for now,” adding that the fundamentals in the energy transition space were “very poor.” Another recent report, this time by the Financial Times, strengthens the perception that not all is well with the transition and maybe the investment entities shifting their focus have a point. In that report, the FT said that green energy stocks had slumped to the lowest in five years despite an improving interest rate environment and continued strong government support for all things transition. “Companies that we hold in the decarbonization sector have seen strong growth and stable returns, but they have underperformed in terms of share price,” the FT cited the chief of sustainable equity at Ninety One, Deirdre Cooper, as saying. “I have never seen such bearishness in terms of the valuation for companies with structural growth . . . The market is assuming no growth for decarbonisation [ie the sector],” Cooper added. In the latest sign that a shift is underway in the energy investment world, Aviva Investors, a division of French insurance giant Aviva, revised plans to divest from companies that are, according to Aviva, not doing enough to decarbonize. The investment arm of the insurer cited a “very different macro backdrop” and the fact that “Concerns over energy security and economic recovery have come to the fore, which in turn has had an impact on the regulatory environment and trajectory of national decarbonisation plans.” The energy transition was supposed to be strong, unstoppable, and accelerating. Instead, it is slowing down, despite the massive government support, and returns, where there were any, are down, too. As one executive from a French climate NGO told Bloomberg, “Financial institutions will need to pick a side.” Indeed they will—the choice would be between the side that makes money and the side that loses it.

Title: Hapag-Lloyd CEO Foresees ‘Considerable’ Changes to USTR Port Fee Proposal
URL: https://sourcingjournal.com/topics/logistics/hapag-lloyd-ceo-port-fees-proposal-ocean-carriers-container-shipping-1234741300/
Time Published: 2025-03-20T20:54:25Z
Full Content:
By Glenn Taylor Hapag-Lloyd CEO Rolf Habben Jansen expects the proposed U.S. port fees on Chinese ships to add “considerable” additional costs to U.S. consumers, and “make life a lot more difficult” for American exporters. However, the CEO is optimistic the proposal will look different once industry and public feedback rolls in. After the March 24 hearing on the port fees takes place, Habben Jansen expects there will be considerable changes to the current proposal. Under the U.S. Trade Representative’s current recommendation, Chinese ships could be paying as much as $1.5 million to dock at an American port. “Once something comes out, we will need to decide how to react,” Habben Jansen said, comparing the current scenario to when the Ocean Shipping Reform Act was signed into law in 2022. That law expanded the powers of the Federal Maritime Commission, enabling the government agency to more heavily scrutinize ocean carriers and terminal operators for perceived unfair practices like imposing detention and demurrage fees, or refusing to honor contracts with shippers. “Initially, the very first ideas about what should be done were quite difficult and very complex, and not particularly well thought through,” Habben Jansen said. “Then there was this similar consultation process and in the end, the final ruling that came out was actually very workable and also reasonable and in my opinion also suited for purpose. We hope that something similar will happen now.” Related Stories Topics Maersk Shareholders Vote Against Halting Military Equipment Shipments to Israel Topics Red Sea Risks Re-Escalate as US Hits Houthis with Airstrikes Habben Jansen made the comments early Thursday during Hapag-Lloyd’s earnings call, which saw the ocean carrier’s revenue jump 6 percent to $5.3 billion on a net income on profits that dipped 19 percent to $754 million. Like Gemini Cooperation partner Maersk, the timing of the return of container ships to the Red Sea will do some heavy lifting in shaping how much profit Hapag-Lloyd will generate in 2025. Group earnings before interest and taxes is projected to be in the range of $0 to $1.5 billion for the year, putting the top end at nearly half of 2024’s EBIT of $2.8 billion. The earnings expectations assume that the Red Sea passages will be gradually resumed in the second half of 2025. But the recent breaking of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire and new U.S. attacks on Houthi targets in Yemen both make conditions tougher for ocean carriers to consider bringing vessels back through the Suez Canal. Hapag-Lloyd’s 2025 projections also account for the impact of U.S.-levied tariffs and potential counter measures, although the company’s annual report indicates that the situation “could not be reliably assessed.” The guidance didn’t impress shareholders, with Hapag-Lloyd stock falling nearly 8 percent in Thursday trading. According to Habben Jansen, cargo volumes for the new fiscal year are expected to increase more than 10 percent for the Germany-based container shipping giant due to the Gemini Cooperation launch with Maersk, alongside a higher mix of long-term contracts in its larger book of business than compared to last year. “That has been a conscious choice because we believe that we need that in order to get to that 10 percent growth,” Habben Jansen said. “That gives us some protection against fluctuations in the spot market because a bigger chunk of our volume will not fluctuate with those rates. But in fairness, we are still vulnerable if spot rates go down too much.” The company acknowledged that geopolitical disputes, especially an escalation of the Middle East conflicts, could negatively influence volume development. Hapag-Lloyd anticipates a moderate decline in average freight rate compared to last year, which saw extended volatility due to the Red Sea concerns and capacity constraints. As of Thursday, Drewry’s World Container Index lists average ocean spot freight rates at $2,264 per container, down 4 percent from the week prior and down 42 percent since the start of the year. Habben Jansen also gave insight into the early stages of the Gemini Cooperation vessel-sharing alliance, which now has 46 of its 57 services up and running. More than half of the ships have been phased into the network, he said. The CEO said the company’s schedule reliability is hovering around roughly 90 percent, meeting the goal both Hapag-Lloyd and Maersk agreed upon last year. However, container shipping database EeSea said this week that the reliability metrics have been on a recent downward trend since the beginning of February. Since Feb. 24, Gemini arrivals have had a weekly on-time performance of 87 percent, 84 percent and 83 percent, respectively. The Germany-based shipping company isn’t sweating the recent slippage. “There is certainly quite a lot of fine-tuning to do left, right and center, but we also still see many things that we can do better. Of anything, I’m probably more confident now than I was six or eight weeks ago that we will be able to deliver that 90 percent schedule reliability consistently,” Habben Jansen said. “If we fast forward three or six months, then I’m fairly sure that a lot of many of our customers, analysts and others in the market will also be able to determine that there is indeed a material difference based on all the data that is available.” Beyond adjusting its Maersk partnership, Hapag-Lloyd is building up its terminal portfolio, with aims to expand its current slate from 21 terminals to over 30 by 2030. The planned expansion reflects a wider trend among operators like Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC)—which scooped up 43 ports as part of the BlackRock-led consortium that also acquired both Panama Canal-adjacent ports—to gain greater control over their supply chains.

(ABC North Queensland: Georgia Loney) Rainfall is easing in north Queensland but some heavy falls are still possible. Multiple flood warnings are in place in north Queensland. North Queensland residents and businesses are dealing with the impact of their second flood in as many months. Heavy rainfall may be easing in some areas in north Queensland, but the impact of a days-long deluge is still being felt. Areas around Townsville, like Ingham, are dealing with the fallout of their second flood in as many months. "Grounds are very saturated and rivers are already swollen, so additional rainfall has simply nowhere to go," Senior Meteorologist Miriam Bradbury said. "We are expecting showers and thunderstorms across northern and western parts of the state. "Higher falls are also possible about the north-east tropical coast between Cairns and Townsville, associated with those days of heavy rain and flooding." The rain has caused further damage to the Sooning Street Bridge on Magnetic Island. (Supplied) A major flood warning is in place for the Herbert River, with minor flood warnings current for the Tully, Ross, Bohle, and Haughton Rivers. The Bureau of Meteorology said the next couple of days will see the risk of heavy falls along the stretch of coast between Townsville and Cairns easing back. "We've got significant moisture streaming off the Gulf of Carpentaria and feeding into a likely thunderstorm risk across parts of the Peninsula, the Gulf country and the North-West districts," Ms Bradbury said. Cane growers say the latest deluge of wet weather could delay this year's cane crush. Canegrowers are concerned more rain will delay crushing. (ABC North Qld: Georgia Loney) Some towns in north Queensland have seen 24-hour rainfall totals of more than 400 millimetres this week as the region cleans up from February floods. Growers are still reeling from damage caused earlier in the wet season. Leah Russo is a Grower Director on the Canegrowers Herbert River Board says there are concerns with more wet weather on the way. "It is possible that if the rain continues, which forecasters are saying that maybe towards the end of next week, we could be in for more significant rain, " she said. There are roads in north Queensland that are still closed due to damage caused by the February floods. Residents in the holiday town of Paluma, about 90 kilometres from Townsville, say they are completely isolated again. Paluma residents must take a two-hour detour to avoid landslips on Mount Spec Road. (Supplied: Department of Transport and Main Roads) Tourism operator Kurt Harlow said they had been told by Transport and Main Roads that Mount Spec Road would be open by the end of April, but to locals only. "We've had two major tourism organisations that have had to cancel their bookings for the rest of the year," he said. "We can't do that … we'll be broke." Frustration is brewing for people in north Queensland impacted by ongoing road closures. Mechanic Jaxon Kaupilla got stuck in Ingham yesterday after driving in from Blackrock to work. Jaxon Kaupilla says he was stranded in Ingham on Thursday. (ABC North Qld: Georgia Loney) "I wish we could somehow improve our road systems so this happens less."

Title: Exclusive Poll: Majority of Americans Oppose ESG as State Financial Officers Fight Against It
URL: https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/03/20/exclusive-poll-majority-americans-oppose-esg-state-financial-officers-fight-against-it/
Time Published: 2025-03-20T18:53:40Z
Full Content:
A majority of Americans oppose controversial environment, social, and governance (ESG) policies, which state financial officers across the nation have committed to fighting, Breitbart News has learned exclusively. A survey conducted by TargetPoint, exclusively obtained by Breitbart News, found that 56 percent of Americans agree that “ESG is a highly subjective, politically charged idea that is forcing progressive policies on everyday Americans resulting in higher prices for nearly everything.” In contrast, 27 percent disagreed with that statement, and 17 percent did not know enough to register an opinion. Eighty-eight percent agreed that the government should focus more on protecting individual rights so that Americans can achieve prosperity, and 86 percent agreed that open debate and civil discourse should be encouraged to find solutions to financial and policy challenges. ESG has become the latest vector through which Wall Street asset managers such as BlackRock, Vanguard, State Street, Baillie Gifford & Company, and others push companies to adopt leftist policies they otherwise would not back. Asset managers often push companies to adopt policies intended to fight climate change, diversity requirements, and other policies advocating for racial justice. O.J. Oleka, the CEO of the State Financial Officers Foundation (SFOF), said in a statement to Breitbart News that the poll reveals that Americans are increasingly tired of corporations becoming politicized. He said: When asked who they might trust most to make the right decisions on fiscal and financial matters, 47 percent pointed to state financial officers, 31 percent said governors, and 22 percent said congressional lawmakers. Americans trust state financial officers more than governors, attorneys general, and legislators when it comes managing a state’s finances, overseeing state investments, ensuring taxpayer dollars are efficiently spent, and ensuring financial transparency. Many large asset managers such as BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street have infamously pushed controversial policies through proxy voting. Here are some of BlackRock and Baillie Gifford’s most egregious proxy votes: State financial officers have fought back against this sort of leftist encroachment in corporate America. The same year, Oklahoma State Treasurer Todd Russ (R) blacklisted 13 financial institutions deemed to be boycotting the energy industry. In 2022, Glenn Hegar, the Texas state comptroller, banned BlackRock and nine other finance firms from working with the Lone Star State after they declared their hostility to fossil fuels. “The environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) movement has produced an opaque and perverse system in which some financial companies no longer make decisions in the best interest of their shareholders or their clients, but instead use their financial clout to push a social and political agenda shrouded in secrecy,” Hegar said in a statement at the time. The strong pushback against ESG, in part from state financial officers, led BlackRock CEO Larry Fink in 2023 to lament that he no longer uses the term “ESG” as it has been “weaponized.” “We have a mandate to keep fighting to protect the American people’s money from the disaster that is woke political ideology,” Oleka concluded. Utah State Treasurer Marlo Oaks, the State Financial Officers Foundation national chairman, told Breitbart News, “These results are certainly encouraging, but not surprising. Families in Utah and nationwide care deeply about their financial security, not just for themselves but for future generations,” he said. “They see radical forces and ideologies being financed with their dollars and rightly expect us to push back. That’s what every SFOF member is doing.” “We won’t rest until these political movements are no longer threatening Americans with our own money to put far-left politics over retirement profits,” he vowed.

Posted on 03/20/2025 11:23:29 AM PDT by zeestephen American households are allocating so much money to U.S. stocks that the valuation of the whole market is now dependent on their appetite, according to JPMorgan...This record level of ownership creates a lockstep movement between the price-earnings ratio of the S&P 500 and the retail flow into the market. (Excerpt) Read more at cnbc.com ... But how much of that is controlled by Blackrock, etc.? Are households owning individual stocks or stocks in an ETF/mutual fund. How they own stocks makes a difference. if a majority of the investors are prone to panic sell, the market may reflect that... but not for long. Can’t have the proletariat making money like our rulers. yup....left wing media: Americans not saving money??? Bad Americans investing int he stock market? Bad bttt The article is referring to individual accounts. BlackRock has no authority to buy, sell, or vote the stock shares of individual accounts, unless the individual has contracted with BlackRock to manage the account. BlackRock has no authority to buy, sell, or vote the stock shares of individual accounts, unless the individual has contracted with BlackRock to manage the account. “Can’t have the proletariat making money like our rulers.” ___________________________________________________________ The regular “household” investor is supposed to be the patsy. As long as the post WW2 inflationary market holds up, the index fund investors who have held their holdings throughout numerous economic storms should perform nicely. The wildcard, which I don’t forsee happening anytime soon, would be the type of deflationary pressure that hit in the mid 1920’s and continued throughout the 1930’s. In that environment, you would want to hold dividend paying companies that held up their valuations the best, as well as holding a strong cash position and protecting your money in Treasuries. I have bought more stock in the last month than all of last year. Ladies and Gentlemen I give you GAMESTOP and the Robinhood rip off. To The Moon!!! Who reads the article? ;-) U.S. households are more invested in stocks than ever and it’s distorting market valuation, says JPMorgan Didn’t she once flash her boobs on The Gong Show? A majority of USA investors hold some or all their money in ETFs and Funds. Regardless, that still impacts the P/E Ratio of the individual stocks in the ETFs and Funds. Regardless, that still impacts the P/E Ratio of the individual stocks in the ETFs and Funds. We’ve been taught over the last 40 years that the only thing that beats inflation is stocks. Don’t blame the people for drawing the only sane conclusion. JP Morgan thinks ordinary Americans are saving and investing too much money? Maybe it’s time for JPMorgan to exit the equities markets and switch to bitcoin, fine art (Hunter Biden paintings are at a discount right now), and politicians’ futures. Buying and owning politicians is still out of reach for rank and file Americans, but for JPMorgan, it’s a natural. Real estate used to be a sound investment for the little guys, and in some places it still is, but in blue cities and states, it puts a “tax me” sign on people’s backs. JPMorgan is big enough to hedge on Ukrainian farmground, especially given its ability to play the politicians futures markets, but that is beyond most of us. Where does JPMorgan suggest middle class Americans park their retirement savings? Passbook savings accounts? This is why I’m 74% in T-Bills and a few Bonds. Stock/Bond account is right at a record high though, so that’s good. I hold 7 stocks, 5 of which pay good dividends. Slow and steady is fine at my age, I don’t even touch any of this money, it’s for the heirs if I don’t blow it. In other words, only the elites should get to control the stock market.

Stock and other traditional financial asset traders across the world are wanting to be able to buy and sell assets around the clock, resulting in two of the biggest stock markets in the U.S., Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) making moves to offer round-the-clock trading soon. “We definitely see that this is where the markets are moving,” said Giang Bui, Nasdaq’s head of U.S. Equities & Exchange-Traded Products, speaking at the Digital Asset Summit in New York on Thursday. “There's a lot of demand globally for U.S. stocks and people want to trade within the hours that they're typically awake, and I think a lot of it is because people are used to trading crypto 24/7.” Both Nasdaq and the NYSE are in the process of receiving approval to open their venues 24 hours a day, for five or even seven days a week. Nasdaq recently announced that it had begun engaging with regulators about the change while the NYSE has already received the green light. Round-the-clock trading can have several advantages for markets, including increased volume and market liquidity as traders aren’t tied to specific time zones. Currently, the U.S. stock market opens for trading at 9:30 a.m. ET and closes at 4 p.m. ET. “We're hearing it across the board from global broker dealers, clients who they're servicing, even within the U.S., there's a number of U.S. brokers that already are offering overnight trading because their customers are used to trading crypto in those hours,” Bui added. Nasdaq lists a number of crypto-related products, including the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), the spot ETF issued by BlackRock, which saw the most successful ETF debut in the history of U.S. ETF launches. Earlier today, the exchange listed two Solana (SOL) futures ETFs issued by Volatility Shares.

However, Lamar Advertising also paid dividends during these 10 years. Lamar Advertising's dividend yield is currently 5.46%. Over the last 10 years, it has paid about $40.28 in dividends per share, which means you could have made $6,820 from dividends alone.
