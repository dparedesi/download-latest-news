February 11, 2025 | 8 min read Listen to article 4 min Climate Transition Plans will become crucial for comms teams thanks to the EU’s directive on ESG, says Olly Lawder at Revolt. See these plans as an opportunity to align company values and let the world – and your investors – know about the great work you do. Climate Transition Plans (CTPs) allow companies to creatively communicate their roadmap to net zero, says Lawder / Explore with Joshua via Unsplash The Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) has raised the bar on Environment, Social, and Governance (ESG) reporting. It’s estimated that 50,000 companies with a presence in the EU will have to comply with the directive, which requires companies to share information on their monitoring of many ESG issues. The directive is purposefully technical, and this complexity can create a hurdle for communication and engagement. But an opportunity does exist in the shape of the Climate Transition Plan (CTP). The CTP is a mandatory part of the reporting and offers companies an opportunity to creatively communicate their roadmap to net zero. And while marketers may not be creating CTPs, they will certainly be communicating them. The CTP translates sometimes intangible and distant net zero goals into a credible, granular, and powerful business strategy to show to stakeholders. As a mandatory part of CSRD, businesses shouldn’t view the CTP as simply a compliance exercise but as an opportunity to stand out and deliver. Knowing that businesses will be heavily focused on CTPs this year with CSRD coming into force, Revolt conducted quantitative research with over 400 marketing and PR leaders in the US who work at companies with offices in the EU. The aim was to find out just how much marketers know about the directive and whether they will embrace the creative opportunities that CTPs present in their marketing and communications. Reassuringly, we found that nearly 96% of marketeers are aware of CTPs. Given the importance and ramifications of CSRD, we were not surprised by this. However, 30% report that they are either unaware if their company has a CTP or that their company is not developing one. This is a worryingly high percentage, and clearly more needs to be done to ensure that all companies are aware of their climate transition responsibilities. The good news is that all respondents agree – either strongly or somewhat – that CTPs represent good comms opportunities. But when asked about the extent of communications planning around CTPs for the next 12 months, only a third of respondents said they have a specific plan for communicating transition plans. Additionally, 65% reported that CTP communication was not in the broader communications plan, and 71% said they hadn’t budgeted for CTP communications. So, while there is a good understanding of the marketing opportunity with CTPs, there is a real gap in terms of actually making it happen. When we addressed this with respondents, we found a variety of reasons for the slow or lacking movement in communicating CTPs. Concern about accidentally greenwashing is the number one barrier to creatively engaging on climate transition plans. This was followed by a perceived difficulty in engaging audiences in what some consider a ‘depressing topic,’ as well as audiences lacking interest in the subject matter. Other reasons included the complexity of the issues and marketers feeling out of their comfort zone with the topic. However, these barriers can and should be overcome. I believe that there are three things marketers and corporate affairs teams should keep in mind to ensure effective communication of transition plans. Advertisement Climate change isn’t a future concern; it’s already upon us – and investors are looking to invest in businesses that build resilience to climate risks and are ready to take on climate opportunities. Almost 99% of leading global insurance companies have now set a low-carbon transition objective within their investment portfolios, according to Blackrock. While CTPs existed before CSRD, they lacked granularity. The new directive will create a groundswell of information that investors will look at, including the disclosure of climate-related risks, transition-related opportunities, investment plans for low-carbon technologies, impacts on staff, scenario-planning, and financial allocation for activity. The CTP is an opportunity to translate your net-zero strategy into a powerful investment story – a story of resilience, adaptability, and competitive advantage that only your business can offer investors. It forms part of an ongoing dialogue and is a way to update investors on your transition progress. Advertisement Every stakeholder plays a role in delivering on your CTP, but none is as important as your employees. Employees are potential champions and crucial implementers of your transition strategies. Employees play a role across all three principles of the CTP – Ambition, Action, and Accountability – and they act as change agents who can ensure the CTP does not just live in a document. Showcasing how individual roles directly contribute to broader goals creates a compelling narrative that will help retain talent who see sustainability as a personal mission rather than a corporate imperative. To transition successfully, businesses will need people with the right skill sets and CTP comms that hero employees – and show that measurable impact can help to attract future talent who value sustainability.

Stay up to date with a curated digest of the most important marketing stories and expert insights from our global team. Learn how to pitch to our editors and get published on The Drum. For effective transition planning, businesses must engage their value chain because, in most cases, Scope 3 emissions (all indirect emissions relating to business activity, excluding utilities) represent the largest portion of a business’s carbon footprint. So, while CTPs are individual to each business, they can only be achieved with systemic change across suppliers and geographies. It’s important that CTPs deliver and communicate a detailed and quantifiable picture of the value chain, including its most opaque areas. View the CTP not as a supplier compliance checklist but rather a communication device to highlight a shared purpose between your business and your value chain. Move toward storytelling that demonstrates genuine partnership and success stories, collaborative decarbonization efforts, and, in turn, acts as a confidence-builder for other stakeholders too, including investors. CTPs will become a critical element of the comms suite around reporting going forward, and with the first CSRD disclosures being made in 2025, the time to engage is now. Plans will be scrutinized, so get ready to be vocal and to defend and uphold them, but do not see your comms solely as a form of defense. Instead, engaging and ambitious comms are your opportunity to inspire stakeholders, catalyze investment and innovation, and ensure your plans progress into reality. Revolt The world is on fire. There’s no time to watch from the sidelines. The most successful brands of tomorrow will be the ones that take a stand today. It’s time...

Title: Why is the United States economy so much stronger than Europe’s?
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2025/02/11/why-is-the-united-states-economy-so-much-stronger-than-europes/

Forget about Donald Trump for a moment and consider why the US economy is so much stronger than Europe’s. Most agencies earmark growth of 2.5-3 per cent for the US economy this year against 1 per cent in Europe. And that 1 per cent looks shaky. It may also be revised down if US tariffs against the EU materialise. [ Trump tariffs threaten Ireland’s service economy too ] Without a significant boost in investment – particularly in infrastructure and green technologies – Europe risks falling further behind the US and the global economy, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is warning. There are several reasons for Europe’s flagging performance and the US’s better-than-expected one. Europe has been more impacted by the energy crisis for one (higher energy costs have dented manufacturing output in Europe’s largest economy Germany, which has also been impacted by weaker Chinese demand). The prospect of tax cuts and less regulation in the US appears to be having an equal and opposite effect on the other side of Atlantic. But these potentially short-term trends aside, there is an endemic productivity gap between the US and Europe. Productivity is one of those glaze-over economic phenomena, but it underpins performance and explains better than any other the reason why the US leads much of the world when it comes to technology. At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last month, the head of the IMF, Kristalina Georgieva, gave perhaps the most cogent explanation for the productivity gap between the US and Europe. “The US is marching ahead with high productivity because capital markets allocate money to dynamic firms ... because technology turns into business investment and grows into companies fast and because the US has an abundance of cheap energy,” she said. Her point was echoed by Larry Fink, chief executive of investment giant BlackRock. “Any entrepreneur, any small company, any large company can find capital and that foundation of capital – raising allows much more entrepreneurialism, much more creativity,” he said. The strength of the US’s capital markets allows the US to modify, rebuild itself, change direction faster than any other economy, he said.

Title: Bitcoin And Politics Merge: Florida Moves Toward State Crypto Investment

The American state of Florida could be one of the pioneering local governments that allows a percentage of its state funds for cryptocurrency investments, particularly Bitcoin. Florida Senator Joe Gruters has filed a bill that would permit the US state to use 10% of its funds to buy Bitcoin. This political backing could entice other American states to build their own cryptocurrency investments. My state of Florida introduces a Bitcoin investment bill! 💪 If passed Florida’s CFO may allocate up to 10% of public funds to invest in $BTC or other digital assets. Thank you Senator Joe Gruters 🫡 pic.twitter.com/nF0SoTbT96 — Lucidvein (@Lucidvein) February 8, 2025 Gruters introduced a legislative measure that would allow Florida to invest in Bitcoin using state funds to combat inflation. The senator said that Senate Bill 550 proposed to permit Florida’s chief financial officer to use up to 10% of its funds to buy Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The bill aims to incorporate Bitcoin into state financial planning in the US, a legislative action that could reshape state authorities’ investment funds strategy and lead to other states adopting crypto. Gruters eyes that the proposed bill would help financial planners of Florida to hedge against inflation. “Inflation has eroded the purchasing power of assets held in state funds managed by the Chief Financial Officer, and this erosion diminishes the value of the state’s reserves, affecting the financial stability and economic security of this state, its taxpayers, and its residents,” Gruters said. The senator explained in the bill that inflation has “eroded the purchasing power of assets” managed by the state’s chief financial officer, adding that the state is responsible for safeguarding “Florida’s financial resources” against inflation and economic uncertainties. Hence, the American senator explained that Florida should have access to tools like Bitcoin to protect state funds from inflation. Once Gruter’s proposed legislation was enacted, it would be beneficial to the state in several ways. Analysts said that investing in Bitcoin would diversify Florida’s state assets, adding that the state would incorporate in its portfolio an asset that historically provides high returns but with significant volatility. Market observers added that this crypto legislation would help turn Florida into a blockchain hub that promotes cryptocurrency innovation, further establishing Florida as a crypto-friendly state. Florida might become the model state for adopting Bitcoin in state financial planning, making BTC adoption in government finance a reality. Crypto analysts also see that Florida’s success could encourage other states to follow its lead and start incorporating digital assets into their financial systems.

Title: A Trump executive order reportedly has ended a racial discrimination probe at Tesla

Featured Shows MSNBC TV More Follow msnbc More Brands More Shows By Ja'han Jones Policy proposals from the new administration — and the seemingly unmatched power granted to Elon Musk and his allies — sure do suggest that Donald Trump is trying to serve his megarich benefactor more than nearly anyone else. Whether it’s punishing South Africa for attempting to stem the impact of apartheid racism or giving bigoted white men unfettered access to the upper echelon of the U.S. government, it seems Trump and his allies are ensuring that Musk gets ample returns on the multimillion-dollar investment he made in Trump’s campaign. And the apparent benefits to Musk could also include the suspension of a federal probe into allegations of racial discrimination at his company Tesla. An executive order Trump signed Jan. 21 as part of his crusade against diversity required the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, which is part of the Department of Labor and investigates discrimination allegations, to immediately halt “[p]romoting ‘diversity’” and “[h]olding Federal contractors and subcontractors responsible for taking ‘affirmative action.’” According to The San Francisco Standard, the order essentially required the compliance office to stop an audit of Tesla over allegations of discrimination at one of its automobile factories. The Standard reported: The Department of Labor’s Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs enforced equal employment laws for federal contractors. The office’s employees now have little to do besides notifying companies that they will no longer be audited for potential discrimination — and, in some cases, that they won’t have to pay outstanding fines. The Standard reported that Tesla was recently notified that the discrimination probe had been halted. Other large corporations were made aware of dropped investigations into their workplaces, too: The OFCCP sent Tesla a letter last week stating that its review had stopped. “We had to mail the companies we audit to tell them they no longer have to comply with our rules or regulations,” said Aliyah Levin, president of the American Federation of Government Employees Local 2391, which represents 1,200 federal workers in San Francisco and eight Western states. Tesla’s letter was one among dozens in California alone, according to Levin. OFCCP investigators were set to review the practices of more than 2,000 U.S. companies this year, including 211 in California, according to federal data that is no longer online. Investigations have been canceled at the San Francisco offices of Google, Meta, Blackrock, Sony, and PG&E, among others. According to The Standard, a federal lawsuit against Tesla from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission is ongoing. When the lawsuit was announced in 2023, the EEOC said: “Black employees regularly encountered graffiti, including variations of the N-word, swastikas, threats, and nooses, on desks and other equipment, in bathroom stalls, within elevators, and even on new vehicles rolling off the production line.” The EEOC also said that “those who raised objections to racial hostility suffered various forms of retaliation, including terminations, changes in job duties, transfers, and other adverse employment actions.” Tesla has called the allegations “a false narrative that ignores Tesla’s track record of equal employment opportunity.” It’s unclear how the lawsuit progresses from here. Trump’s acting EEOC chair, Andrea Lucas, has already gotten to work pursuing his priorities of rolling back protections for transgender and nonbinary people. How she’ll approach a discrimination suit against one of Trump’s closest allies remains an open question. Ja’han Jones is The ReidOut Blog writer.

Title: Gold Hits New Record: Trump's Tariffs, Inflation Fears Drive Safe Haven Surge

Gold prices rose to yet another record high Monday, extending a yearslong rally for the precious metal accelerated in recent weeks as President Donald Trump’s tariffs upend global trade policy, and investors and central banks search for safety in the evolving global economy. Gold is on a remarkable hot streak. Spot gold rose to as high as $2,938 per troy ounce on the New York Mercantile Exchange, rising as much as 1.7%. Monday’s rally tied to Trump’s imposition of a blanket 25% tariff on all aluminum and tariff imports, the latest in a scorching stretch for gold. Up 44% over the last year, gold has been by far the best-performer across a basket of 12 leading global asset classes over the period, according to the BlackRock Investment Institute, most notably trouncing the 22% return for the S&P 500 over the last year, including reinvested dividends. And Wall Street largely believes the gains will continue: JPMorgan Chase maintains a $2.950 end-of-2025 price target for gold, Goldman Sachs holds a $3,000 target by the middle of 2026 and Citigroup has a $3,000 target by the end of this year. Gold breaking $3,000, which would only require a less than 3% rally from Monday’s prices, would be the latest milestone for a roaring 2020s for gold, which only crossed $1,000 for the first time during 2008’s great financial crisis and $2,000 for the first time during 2020’s COVID-19 pandemic. It’s rare for gold to have such a strong performance during a time of economic strength globally, especially in the U.S., which has many of the hallmarks of an economy far from recession with a resilient labor market, stock market highs and relatively stable inflation. Though long-held concerns about inflation and geopolitical tensions such as the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine and diminished interest rate cut prospects weigh on the minds of gold investors, experts mostly tie the recent gold rally to Trump’s tariffs. Gold “clearly would benefit from universal tariffs,” according to JPMorgan’s head of cross asset strategy Fabio Bassi, while Goldman commodities strategist Lina Thomas wrote of gold’s “potentially persistent boost from elevated US policy uncertainty.” And there’s a continued undercurrent of historic gold purchasing from central banks globally, as those institutions bought more than 1,000 tonnes of gold in 2024, the third consecutive year of at least 1,000 tonnes in central bank purchases after never crossing that mark prior to 2022, according to the World Gold Council. The People's Bank of China is the most notable buyer, accounting for 43% of all central bank gold purchases in November, according to Goldman. Central banks typically buy gold to safeguard against inflation or other deterioration of their home currencies. Gold has unexpectedly become one of the hottest financial assets on the market despite being one of the oldest investments in human history. Gold and other commodities do not offer the same potential for dividends or other returned shareholder value like stocks or guaranteed annual interest payments like bonds, making the metal’s rise more stark. Gold and bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency thought by some to be a new-school hedge against economic uncertainty, have gone on divergent paths since Trump announced the 25% tariffs on all Canadian and Mexican goods and a 10% additional tariffs on Chinese imports (the Canadian and Mexican levies were later delayed). Gold prices are up 2% since Trump signed the tariff executive order Feb. 1, while bitcoin is down 6%. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

Title: Industry Expert Sees A ‘Cyclical Valhalla’ Sending Bitcoin’s Price To $700,000 While Solana Targets $1,800

Bill Barhydt, the CEO of crypto investment firm Abra Global, recently took to the X social media platform (aka Twitter) to stir the BTC community with a bold Bitcoin price prediction. Barhydt proposed that the price of Bitcoin, the world’s largest crypto by market cap, could climb all the way to $700,000 per coin during this market cycle due to an incoming gigantic liquidity injection. He foresees a “cyclical Valhalla” to begin in Q1. Abra founder Bill Barhydt believes that BTC price at a whopping $350,000 is now the “base case” scenario. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading hands at $97,466, representing a 1.2% gain in the last 24 hours. Despite having lost 2.8% of its value over the last seven days, Barhydt thinks the only way is up for the world’s flagship cryptocurrency. Besides predicting that Bitcoin is on pace to hit $700K, the BTC veteran also shared ambitious targets for Ethereum and Solana’s SOL. Specifically, he argues that ETH and SOL could reach $8,000 and $900, respectively, in a base case. “High end of the range is ~2x these values,” Barhydt added. The rationale for Abra CEO’s bullish forecast is the new U.S. government under pro-crypto president Donald Trump. “My model is simple. This administration wants interest rates much lower, and they’ll do whatever they have to achieve that,” he explained. “They also need to refinance over $7T in debt. Tax cuts are coming. All of this equates to a massive liquidity injection whether via QE or some other means.” Barhydt was referring to quantitative easing (QE) — increasing the money supply — which has historically led to a drastic increase in the price of equities and crypto. Trump admin’s proposed tax cuts could boost this liquidity surge, aligning with what he terms the “cyclical Valhalla” — a period where daring investors could earn handsomely from the market’s evolving dynamics. “Cyclical Valhalla is coming. Those with brass balls will be rewarded accordingly,” the Bitcoin OG posited, before highlighting Q1 as the possible deadline for such liquidity injections to start. Barhydt is not the only one who is bullish on Bitcoin’s chances of hitting $700,000. Last month, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink suggested that BTC could hit this lofty price point if it experienced much broader institutional adoption. Fink revealed that many people, including the operators of a sovereign wealth fund he met in Switzerland, are debating whether to have a 2% or 5% allocation to Bitcoin.

Title: ANSON FRERICKS: Let’s All Lift A Glass And Wish For This Famous Beer Company To Become American Again

Anheuser-Busch’s CEO wants to market its beer as “American made,” rather than “domestic”—the term that typically differentiates U.S. beer from “imports.” However, Anheuser-Busch isn’t really an American company. But maybe it’s time to make it one again. Anheuser-Busch hasn’t been American owned since 2008. That’s the year the 156-year-old American brewer was purchased by its Belgium-based, European rival, Inbev. The company was renamed Anheuser-Busch Inbev, and is now the largest beer company in the world, selling one in four beers globally. This globalization might have sounded good on paper, but it was a disaster for Anheuser Busch. In 2008, Anheuser-Busch produced over 100 million barrels of beer in the US and employed over 21,000 people. Today, it produces 60 million barrels and has shed thousands of jobs. The errors compounded over time. Following the takeover, Inbev imported executives from Belgium and Brazil to run sales and marketing in the US. It didn’t work. Marketing execs canceled partnerships with country music festivals and the Ultimate Fighting Championship and replaced them with techno concerts more common in Europe. Then came the forced plunge into Stakeholder Capitalism, ESG and DEI. In the U.S., companies historically operated to serve shareholders—i.e., to generate profits. The European model is different. It compels companies to serve all stakeholders, including activists, governments, the environment and non-profits. Around 2018, that started to change. Wall Street firms like BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, began foisting the stakeholder model on U.S. companies. Given its European roots, Anheuser-Busch Inbev quickly went all in. As the head of U.S. sales and distribution, I felt the changes immediately. Longstanding principles like merit disappeared. Commitments to diversity, equity and inclusion replaced them. A LGBTQ+ advocacy group called The Human Rights Campaign (HRC) monitored progress. By 2022, HRC required companies to make at least three “public commitments to the LGBTQ+ community,” including lobbying, donating to LGBTQ+ charities and favoring LGBTQ+ suppliers. If companies disobeyed, they lost their perfect HRC scores. Brands felt compelled to act. But as Bud Light soon learned, there was much more than an HRC score at stake. On April 1, 2023, the most popular beer in America, Bud Light, entered into a disastrous social media partnership with the transgender activist Dylan Mulvaney. They sent Dylan a commemorative Bud Light can to celebrate Dylan’s 365-day journey of transitioning from a biological male to a female. The reaction was explosive. Customers boycotted. Celebrities chimed in. Kid Rock was among the first to do so, posting a video of himself shooting Bud Lights with an AR-15 rifle. Anheuser-Busch’s CEO, Brendan Whitworth, fumbled the response. He neither apologized to loyal consumers for the controversial ad nor stood by Dylan Mulvaney as more progressive customers demanded. Bud Light was supposed to be “easy to drink, easy to enjoy.” It was the number one-rated beer brand because it was remarkably apolitical. Enjoyed by Democrats and Republicans alike. No more. Millions of customers ditched Bud Light. The stock price nose-dived. Forty-billion dollars of shareholder value was erased. The company still hasn’t recovered. Bud Light sales are down 40% since the controversy and it is now the number three-ranked beer brand in America. But it’s not too late for a comeback—if Bud Light returns to its roots. That means returning Bud Light to American owners. It wouldn’t be an unprecedented move. TikTok is being forced to sell in the US for similar reasons: It is owned by a foreign firm with values antithetical to the US. Is Anheuser-Busch Inbev capturing data of US citizens like TikTok? No. But has it harmed US culture and created job losses? Yes. And in this case, there’s no need for government intervention, since a sale would be in Inbev’s best interests too. Inbev clearly doesn’t know what it’s doing; a sale would allow it to recoup its losses while entrusting Anheuser-Busch’s future to someone who understands the American market. New owners could revive the American icon. A group like Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway or a consortium of private equity firms led by Stephen Schwartzman’s BlackStone could buy the US business for $30 billion to $40 billion. They could hire an American management team dedicated to making Anheuser-Busch the greatest American comeback story in corporate history. Start with a media blitz. Apologize for the failures of past management. Sell a future where beer is fun and apolitical again. Launch or acquire some healthier, non-alcohol brands to become a total beverage company. Hire brilliant marketers. Drive sales growth. Label products “American made” on menus across the country. All Americans can cheers to that.

Title: Conservatives Urge Congress to Confirm 'Strong' Antitrust Advocate Mark Meador for FTC

Conservative leaders on Monday wrote to Senate Commerce Committee Chairman Ted Cruz (R-TX), urging Congress to confirm Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Commissioner nominee Mark Meador, who will be a strong advocate for “strong, yet targeted” antitrust and consumer protection enforcement. The conservative coalition contended that President Donald Trump’s landslide election gave him a “clear mission,” which is to “take our country back from the elites, liberal mobs, and deep state directing our country towards certain disaster.” The conservatives wrote that confirming Meador, a visiting fellow at the Heritage Foundation who served as Sen. Mike Lee’s (R-UT) deputy chief counsel for antitrust and competition policy, is essential to realizing Trump’s goal of removing the malign influence of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) as well as environment, social, and governance (ESG) corporate policies from unduly influencing America’s children. Read letter here: Meador Conservative Letter by jmanship on Scribd They noted Cruz “rightly said” that “every parent with a young child or a teenager either worries about, or knows first-hand, the real harms and dangers of addicted and anxiety-inducing social media.” The coalition noted other issues the FTC urgently needs to address, including: “If we want to make any headway on any of these important issues, we need a strong FTC; these AGs [attorneys general] cannot do it alone,” the conservatives contended. The leaders include: They continued: Mr. Meador has been a long-time advocate for strong, yet targeted antitrust and consumer protection enforcement. He is a well-regarded and influential antitrust scholar. He also has the resume to back it up spanning across both antitrust agencies and as a staffer on Capitol Hill. President Trump could have not chosen a better champion to assist in him ushering in America’s golden age. “Thus, we respectfully request that the Senate Commerce Committee expedite Mr. Meador’s confirmation, so that we can get back on track,” the conservatives wrote to Cruz and the Commerce Committee.

Title: Michelin star awards 2025: Which Irish restaurants will be recognised?

Gah! Found another newly awarded Bib Gourmand lurking. In our defense it was hiding in the UK listings, whereas we consider our restaurants (and their accolades) on an all island basis. mrDeanes in Belfast is the casual dining option opened by Michael Deane in Belfast last year. Here’s what the inspectors said: “Its full name, ‘mrDeanes Bistro, Bar and Social’, paints a perfect picture of this spacious addition to Michael Deane’s ever-evolving Belfast empire. Grab a cocktail at the bar before taking your seat in a restaurant that’s bursting with vitality. The eminently appealing menu offers well-executed takes on dishes from all over the world, be it Gaeng Phed red curry or ‘entrecôte au poivre’. There’s a palpable generosity to the place too, with the food and wine both offering great value for money.” Well done mrDeanes! Ok, that’s a wrap for another year. Hungry work indeed. I’m off to check out bookings. All current holders of Michelin stars (15 one-stars and 5 two-stars) in Ireland retained their stars. Here’s the updated at-a-glance list. For details go to guide.michelin.com/en/ Two stars One star OK, we’ve ferreted out who the new Bib Gourmands (“good food at moderate prices”) in Ireland went to: Owner Zsolt Lukács was awarded the UK & Ireland Sommelier award, and with it a Bib Gourmand. They inspectors said of Daróg: “There’s a huge amount of passion channelled into this welcoming little wine bar. Hungarian-born Zsolt Lukács has an infectious enthusiasm for wine, which comes across in his carefully curated list that gravitates towards small artisan producers using organic and biodynamic methods. Accompanying the wine is a selection of sharing plates – like kingfish crudo – that are exactingly executed, deliver on flavour and provide brilliant value for money. The regularly changing artwork from local artists is on sale and is curated by co-owner Edel." Owned by chef Ahmet Dede, holder of two stars for his Dede restaurant in Baltimore, this is the more informal baby sister. Here the inspectors said: “With a name meaning ‘Baby Dede’, this second Baltimore venture from Chef Ahmet Dede is an ode to his family and comes with all the homespun charm you’d expect. Located mere feet away from his acclaimed flagship restaurant, this is a more relaxed affair but the great value sharing plates retain the older sibling’s ethos of Turkish flavours married with Irish produce. Each dish – from a unique take on oyster chowder to Ahmet’s signature ‘içli köfte’ – is bright, fresh and wholly satisfying." Well that’s good luck and good night from the Michelin Ceremony in Glasgow. How did Ireland fare? One star: Adam Nevin at the Morrison Rooms in Carton House, Maynooth, Co Kildare. Richard Picard-Edwards, Ballyfin Demesne, Mountrath Co Laois. Danny Africano, Lignum Restaurant, Loughrea, Co Galway. Sommelier of the Year: Zsolt Lukács of Daróg Wine Bar, Galway City. Awwwwwww.... that’s it. Just the one news three star which went to Moor Hall. Another year and Ireland misses out on that elusive third star. Now, the NEW THREE STARS Moor Hall, under Mark Birchall, in Aughton, England (Aughton there be one for Chapter One??? c’mon Ireland!!!) ehhhh ... that should read 40 years the Waterside Inn on the go at three stars (reasons I’m not an accountant) Waterside got its third star in 1985 – so that’s 30 years operating at that level. Alain Ducasse quite emotional. OK the biggest of the biggies now – the 3-star awards. Those retaining three stars: Fat Duck; Waterside Inn; Alain Ducasse at Dorchester, Core by Claire Smyth; Sketch, the Lecture Room and Library; Restaurant Gordon Ramsay; The Ledbury; Hélène Darroze at the Connaught. (might have missed one there, but hopefully not) Last two star to Angelo Sato to the pretty coolly named Humble Chicken in London. Verry young looking guy, of few words, except to say he didn’t have a great start in life, so this means a great deal. John looks like everybody’s lovely uncle. “I’ve waited 50 years for this. I thought we were forgotten. we carried on cooking to the best of our ability, but the experience comes with the service.” OK, now it’s the two-star awards. Will we feature? First up Hide and Fox in Kent – Susan says it’s the perrrrrfect country restaurant. I bet it is! The Ritz, London – John Williams MBE is the chef, and he’s getting a standing ovation. Green stars now. Those restaurants that can minimise their environmental footprint – sustainable gastronomy. Kai in Galway is the only holder of this award in Ireland. Quite the achievement when I don’t think they even have a kitchen garden feeding their restaurant. OK, no new gongs for Ireland in this category. Must try harder ... Interesting segment here about women chefs, first-person stories for a wide selection of women of what it’s like operating in a professional kitchen. How they have to break stereotypes re being serious about a cooking career. Head chef women are expected to do everything in their kitchens, men are usually allowed to “just cook”. Imposter syndrome is rife. The media defer to men for opinions all the time. More women need to enter competitions. general experience is that every man believes they are the best (generally when not), women have to be persuaded. And that’s it for the one-star awards – 22 new winners in total. And a glorious, delicious, well-deserved three for Ireland: Adam Nevin, Carton House; Richard Picard-Edwards, Ballyfin Demesne; Danny Africano, Lignum, Co Galway. And don’t forget Best Sommelier UK and Ireland, Zsolt Lukács of Daróg, Galway. Whoop! Whoop! It’s raining Irish stars(ish)! Great news for Ballyfin. The rumour mill had been rife, and went into overdrive when Ballyfin was awarded three Michelin Keys last year – its new award category for top quality hotels. Chef Richard Picard-Edwards joined Ballyfin in April 2023 from the Mandarin Oriental Bittescombe Lodge in the UK. Since arriving the bar has been set at Michelin-star level, served up in a stunning eight-course menu (€145). The restaurant is now open to non-residents too, so at least you don’t have to remortgage the house for an overnight with dinner. Corinna Hardgrave visited last October, when she described the Jerusalem artichoke cream as “downright dazzling”. Three years ago our restaurant critic Corinna Hardgrave said in her Lignum Review she would be “astonished” if Lignum didn’t land a star in the following year. Well dear reader, she, and many others have been disappointed every year since. Located a bit off the well-trod Michelin track in Loughrea, Co Galway, since opening in 2017 chef/proprietor Danny Africano and wife Molly Keane have been firmly in the sights of the Michelin star judges. With a focus on wood-fired cooking it offers a €145, 10-course tasting menu, showcasing seasonal Irish and Italian ingredients. Well worth a detour – in the truest Michelin sense! Danny Africano of Lignum in Loughrea, Co Galway. They’ve been at it since 2017 – recognition at last! Star for Tom Barnes of Skof in Manchester.This was hotly anticipated Star for Lyla in Edinburgh. Scotland doing verrrryyyy well. Can’t wait for them to host the ceremony in Ireland!!! Cardiff gets its first Michelin Star! Going to Tom Waters of Gorse Gary Foulkes at Cornus in London picks up a star. Adam Nevin is formerly of The Grill at The Dorchester, The Hand and Flowers and The Westbury in London. A Maynooth native he only took up the position at Carton House in September 2023. I was lucky enough to dine here a couple of months ago, and what an experience. The dining room, with Lafranchini brothers stuccowork is sensational and steeped in history, but the food is the real star of the show. The tasting menu is about €135, or you can opt for the €110 chef’s five course menu. Recently Mickael Viljanen of Chapter One sang the praises of Nevin’s informal Sunday lunch menu – high praise indeed. Read Corinna Hardgrave’s review from February 2024 here Waheyyyy!!! First Michelin star for Adam Nevin of the Morrison Rooms at Carton House. This guy is only 30, and playing a stormer!!! The people behind Daróg in Galway are husband-and-wife team Zsolt Lukács and Edel McMahon. Lukács was the sommelier at Aniar for a long time, and McMahon is a sister of JP McMahon, well known chef owner of Aniar, prolific food writer and all round food genius. Fantastic! Sommelier award goes to Zsolt Lukacs of Daróg (we knew Daróg was in there somewhere). Great win for a lovely little Irish operation - well deserved!! Service award goes to Jasmine Sherry of Fish Shop a tiny operation in Ballater in the Scottish Highlands. Mentor chef awards goes to Adam Byatt, Trinity restaurant in Clapham, London. Young chef award going to Ash Venezuela-Heeger from River Rabbit restaurant in Birmingham. 36 new bibs in total across UK and Ireland. Two for Ireland, but we don’t find out until they update the guide after the ceremony. Jeez. Not a very fun teaser - especially if you’re a hopeful chef. It’s possible Daróg is in there, but that’s speculation. More as we can confirm it... Susan is back and reminding us that the guide isn’t just about stars. This year 145 new restaurants have been added to the 3000+ in the guide. Now for the Bib Gourmands - quality food at affordable prices. Glasgow has added two new Bibs. Great. What about the Irish ones? Keep you posted. Ok, we’ve just had Mairi Gougeon, cabinet secretary fo rural affairs, land reform and islands. She makes the important point how there would be no awards without the fabulous fresh produce from our land and seas. Followed by lovely pics of Scotland. Aye, aye here comes Gwendal Poullennec international director of the Michelin Guide, getting to the meat and potatoes now. It’s the 125th anniversary of the Michelin guide, so a landmark year for the principles of culinary excellence. Next up we have councillor Susan Aitken, leader of Glasgow City Council. Delighted she is for she and the city to be hosting. Gotta say there’s a distracting and ominous background music that feels like we’ve all suddenly entered the twighlight zone. Our host is Amanda Stretton, UK motorsports racing driver and broadcaster, who tells us this is the first time the ceremony has taken place outside of England. Well this is lovely. A very atmospheric bagpipe and organ introduction - a nice reminder of our surrounds at the beautiful looking Kelvingrove Art Gallery & Museum in Glasgow, Scotland. Talk about all sound, no picture. We’re all on tenterhooks waiting for the ceremony to begin.... oh hang, on! here we go!!! Speculation has been mounting all day as to who the lucky new recipients of stars might be. Smart money at this point is on The Morrison Room at Carton House, Maynooth; Ballyfin Demesne in Laois; Library Street, Dublin 2; Lignum, Co Galway. Meanwhile there’s the eternal will we/won’t we ever attain that third Michelin Star in Ireland. In with a shout would have to be Chapter One, and then there’s always Terre at Castlemartyr, or Restaurant Patrick Guilbaud. All will soon be revealed... We may be just 5 minutes away from the awards starting and if you were ever in any doubt as to how closely Michelin holds its cards to its chest, we can tell you, pretty damn close. We don’t know who is hosting, or how the ceremony will play out, ie when will the Bib Gourmands be announced? at the beginning? at the end? Anyone’s guess. Want to know what the Michelin inspectors think of our current Michelin star restaurants, here’s what they said about each in the 2024 edition of the guide Michelin-starred restaurants in Ireland, 2024: The complete guide: As our countdown to 6pm continues, it’s worth noting that the ceremony only awards NEW stars and Bibs. If a current holder of a Michelin-star or Bib Gourmand is unlucky enough to lose its star, this will only become apparent after the ceremony when Michelin updates its listing to add new winners, and omit those who have failed to retain their award. While tonight is all about looking ahead, it’s good to remember too those that blazed the trail. Back in 1974, Declan Ryan won Ireland’s first Michelin star at the Arbutus Lodge restaurant in Cork. This week he spoke to Barry Roche about what it was like to win such an accolade back then, while Alan Betson shot some lovely video of Declan in West Cork cooking up a salmon and foraged sorrel classic. What’s all the fuss about Michelin stars anyway? The awards have a very interesting back story. They were the brainchild in 1900 of the tyre manufacturing brothers André and Edouard Michelin. There are now more than 3,000 Michelin-starred restaurants in close to 40 countries. The inspectors, who book anonymously and pay their bill in full, have been active in Ireland since 1974. There are degrees of recognition within the guide, the highest being Michelin star level. The impact and pressure of achieving and retaining a star is considerable. This article from 2023 give a nice insight to just what’s involved: Michelin stars: The power to make or break careers, businesses – and lives Put simply there are levels of inclusion in the Michelin guide which operate as follows: At the lowest level, a restaurant can simply be listed in the Guide. That’s an achievement in itself. Bib Gourmand: This is awarded for good food at moderate prices. Last year Ireland added five new Bib Gourmands, bringing its tally here to 18. Usually these are announced a week or two before the Michelin stars, but this year they will announce them tonight along with the stars. These are always of interest because realistically they are the restaurants most ordinary diners can hope to afford, and they can be very good without being too formal. Then, the stars: Good evening and welcome to the most exciting night on the fine dining restaurant calendar. Chefs, proprietors, kitchen teams, gourmets and judges are gathering in the Kelvingrove Art Gallery & Museum in Glasgow, Scotland for the annual Britain & Ireland Michelin Guide ceremony where this year’s winners of the highly coveted Michelin stars for culinary excellence will be announced. Starting at 6pm the ceremony (whose organisers swear the winners in attendance to secrecy in advance) will reveal those restaurants that have been successful in attaining (or adding) a star following visits and assessments from the judges in the last 12 months.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Best Widow and Orphan Stocks To Invest In. In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) stands against other best widow and orphan stocks to invest in. Investing in the stock market can be a prudent strategy for widows and orphans seeking financial stability and growth. Widow-and-orphan stocks are typically associated with established companies in sectors like utilities and consumer staples. These companies often provide consistent dividend payments, offering a reliable income stream. This stability is particularly valuable during economic downturns, as these stocks tend to exhibit lower volatility compared to high-growth equities. Investing in stable, dividend-paying stocks can aid in preserving and growing wealth over time. The combination of regular dividend income and potential capital appreciation makes these stocks suitable for individuals aiming for sustainable financial growth without excessive risk exposure. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. A study published in July 2024 highlights the critical role of financial literacy in investment decisions and stock market participation. The research indicates that increased financial knowledge enhances investment confidence and decision-making, underscoring the importance of targeted financial education programs to empower individuals to participate effectively in the stock market. Recent trends show that women, particularly baby boomers, are increasingly controlling significant amounts of wealth. As of January 2025, women over 60 control $8 trillion of liquid wealth assets. This shift underscores the importance of financial literacy and proactive investment strategies among women to ensure long-term financial security.

For this article, we made a list of large and mega-cap stocks with impressive dividend profiles. From this dataset, we chose companies with strong fundamentals that have shown resilience during rough macroeconomic conditions in the past. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A row of factory workers assembling bottles of sparkling soft drinks on a conveyor belt. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 69 The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) is a beverage company. In the third quarter of 2024, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) witnessed organic revenues grow by 9% despite a 1% decline in net revenues. In February, Coca-Cola Nigeria and its authorized bottler, Nigerian Bottling Company, inaugurated a new domestic packaging collection hub in Apapa, Lagos. The facility is set to bolster Nigeria’s plastics recycling infrastructure with the capacity to process up to 13,000 tonnes of plastic bottles annually. Overall, KO ranks 4th on our list of best widow and orphan stocks to invest in. While we acknowledge the potential of KO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for a stock that is more promising than KO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

(ABC Kimberley: Mya Kordic) Residents in Western Australia's north are "battening down the hatches" amid the risk of a cyclone forming in the next two days. Emergency services are conducting flood modelling and some residents and businesses are gearing up to evacuate properties if required. The Bureau of Meteorology says there is a high chance of tropical low 18U intensifying and that it could cross the Pilbara coast later this week. Residents, authorities and pastoralists in Western Australia's north are preparing for a potential cyclone to form in the next two days as a tropical low heads towards "cyclone alley". As of 9am on Monday, tropical low U18 is 320 kilometres north of Broome and travelling south-west off the Kimberley coast. The Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) said there was a high chance of it forming into a cyclone by Tuesday night and emergency services warned the community to prepare. The bureau's tracking maps indicate that the system could intensify into at least a category two cyclone and cross the Pilbara coast later in the week. A BOM map of the potential cyclone's projected path released on Monday afternoon. (Supplied: Bureau of Meteorology) Pastoralist David Stoate said preparations were underway at Anna Plains Station 250 kilometres south of Broome in "cyclone alley". "We're just battening down the hatches, tying down the buildings and making sure there's no debris or anything that can blow around the homestead," he said. "It's certainly a feature of living in this part of the world. "We do get cyclones at this time of the year … we know the drills, so we'll hopefully follow that." David Stoate is the owner of Anna Plains Station and said preparations were well underway in "cyclone alley". (ABC Kimberley: Alys Marshall) Mr Stoate said everyone in the region would be preparing in a similar fashion. "You get a little bit nervous — I mean, they can be very destructive as as we know," he said. "But the flip side is we could do with a bit of rain here. "So they do have an upside as well, but yeah, at times like this you're sweating on the updates from [the] bureau." The weather system is expected to bring heavy rainfall to Broome. (ABC Kimberley: Mya Kordic) Department of Fire and Emergency Services Superintendent Phil Brandrett said flood modelling was being conducted north of Port Hedland in the Pilbara communities of Strelley and Warralong. Reducing the impact of a cyclone on your family, your home and your animals means making a plan well before the bad weather arrives. "We're looking at what resources we'll have on hand to actually put in place and be out in those particular communities, even in Marble Bar, for example," he said. "We've had some people doing flood modelling as well as worst-case scenarios. The Hedland State Emergency Services unit opened on Sunday afternoon for public sandbag collection. Blackrock Tourist Park manager Marie Carter said there were about 140 people staying in units and 50 permanent residents at the South Hedland site, where storm preparations were underway. The Hedland SES provided sandbags to residents on Sunday afternoon. (Supplied: Department of Fire and Emergency Services) "We personally go around and speak to everyone — we've got such a diverse group of people, from single mums with babies to workers and retirees," she said. "Some stay, some leave, but caravans get strapped down and they go into one of our cyclone-rated units. "We're such a large park, we start work three days before to make sure everything is covered." The Pardoo Roadhouse in the Pilbara was flattened by Cyclone Ilsa. (ABC News: Cason Ho) Pardoo Roadhouse, which was destroyed after Cyclone Ilsa made landfall in 2023, is again preparing for the potential of extreme weather. Owner Will Batth said lessons had been taken from previous experience. "No amount of preparation is ever enough — we know that now," he said. "We are prepared to evacuate if needed. Meteorologist Jonathan How said the tropical low would strengthen over the next two to three days and could develop into a category three system. "There is a little bit of uncertainty as to what the cyclone may do," he said. "Some of the model guidance is suggesting a land crossing around De Grey area and towards Wallal Downs as soon as Wednesday or Thursday. "Other computer guidance is also suggesting that the system actually remains offshore all the way to the weekend and crosses the coast closer to western parts of the Pilbara, as a category four or five system, around Karratha and down towards Onslow."

Terenure avenged November’s loss away to neighbours St Mary’s with a deserved 27-24 win at a jam-packed Lakelands Park on Saturday in Division 1A of the Energia All-Ireland League. The bonus-point victory elevates them above their rivals into second place behind new leaders Cork Con, who beat Terenure in last season’s final. That followed Terenure’s third successive home semi-final and Saturday’s derby has been described as a semi-final on steroids. In front of a crowd of almost 4,000, Terenure were generally on top and had some standout performances in Will Hickey, Jordan Coghlan and Caspar Gabriel, Leinster’s Austrian academy outhalf, who graced the game with some eye-catching moments, including a couple of brilliant high takes. A quick-fire double toward the end of the first period by hooker Max Russell, from a lineout maul, and Coghlan put Terenure 20-14 ahead at the break. Prolific fullback Conor Hayes kept St Mary’s in touch before Coghlan’s second try effectively sealed the win. A questionable Hayes try did earn the visitors a losing bonus point. A slightly weakened Clontarf were knocked off the top following a 27-14 loss away to Young Munster. The Cookies were 12-0 up inside 10 minutes through tries by winger Ihechi Oji and Ruadhán Quinn, who returned along with fellow Munster players Evan O’Connell, Shay McCarthy and Jake O’Riordan. Quinn’s second try had the home side 19-7 up at the break and a try by Hubert Gilvarry sealed the bonus point. Con lead the table on 47 points, ahead of Terenure on 45, followed by Clontarf and St Mary’s. Clontarf, who have a game in hand, host Con next week. Lansdowne had a vital win in Ballynahinch, who led 14-5 after the first quarter before Lansdowne imposed themselves with tries by Liam Molony and a brace by South African lock Juan Beukes. Kyle Gill’s 56th-minute try put Hinch back in front but Lansdowne’s outside centre Andy Marks capped another fine performance with the match-winning, bonus-point try – his 10th of the season – 10 minutes from time. Ballynahinch are on 37 points, with Lansdowne and Young Munster, who meet next week on the Aviva back pitch, both on 36 points. Cork Con went top with a bonus-point 31-19 victory over City of Armagh, who lost both influential fullback Kyle Faloon and try scorer Matthew Hooks to potentially season-ending injuries. Con outhalf James Taylor converted tries by Rob Jermyn, Joe O’Leary, Daniel Hurley and Jack Kelleher, and landed a penalty. UCD thus moved to within two points of City of Armagh with a hugely significant 26-15 bonus-point win over Garryowen, whose 12th successive defeat leaves them 10 points adrift in 10th place. The students’ hooker Bobby Sheehan maintained the familial liking for the try line with a hat-trick. Old Belvedere took a big step toward automatic promotion from Division 1B with a 30-10 win in Highfield to move eight points clear of second-placed Nenagh after their 24-14 defeat to Queen’s. Old Wesley moved to within four points of Nenagh after sharing 14 tries in an astonishing 44-41 win at home to UCC, for whom replacement hooker Luke McAuliffe scored four second-half tries.

Title: Investors await new inflation data amid tariff concerns: What to know this week

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Stocks ended the first week of February little changed as investors digested corporate earnings from Big Tech companies, a hotter-than-expected January jobs report, and continuing updates on President Donald Trump's tariff policies. For the week, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) was roughly flat, while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) and Dow Jones Industrial Average fell about 0.4%. In the week ahead, inflation will take center stage, with the Consumer Price Index (CPI) set for release on Wednesday morning. Updates on wholesale inflation and retail sales will also be closely tracked. But investors will also be keeping a close eye on Trump's planned announcement of new 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, as well as for more details on reciprocal duties across the board. On the corporate front, 78 S&P 500 companies, including McDonald's (MCD), Coca-Cola (KO), Super Micro Computer (SMCI), and Airbnb (ABNB), are set to report earnings. The January jobs report released on Friday showed continued signs of resilience in the labor market as the unemployment rate unexpectedly fell, wages grew more than expected, and December's monthly job gains were revised higher to show the US labor market exited 2024 on an even better footing than previously reported. This prompted economists to argue the Fed likely won't be cutting interest rates anytime soon. And if anything, it puts more pressure on inflation data to show cooling before the central bank brings down borrowing costs. "The more recent data are indicative of a labor market that has regained its footing," Wells Fargo senior economist Sarah House wrote in a note on Friday. "This suggests that the tail risk of a sharp deterioration in the labor market has diminished, and as a result the FOMC can wait to see how the Q1 inflation data and economic policymaking play out before taking further action on the federal funds rate." Stocks rebounded after dropping initially on Monday as President Trump's 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada were delayed at least a month. But what exactly happens with tariffs remains an overhang on markets as investors debate the potential impact on inflation and, subsequently, monetary policy. On Sunday, Trump said he will introduce a 25% tariff on steel and aluminum imported into the US from all countries. He told reporters on Air Force One that he will announce the new metals duties on Monday, but didn't say when they would be implemented. The move puts Canada and Mexico, both top US suppliers of steel and aluminum, back in the hot seat on tariffs. Also stepping up the trade pressure, Trump said on Friday he would announce a plan on reciprocal tariffs on American imports. The comments were made during a meeting with Japan’s Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba. Trump said tariffs on Japan were an option. In a research note on Friday, BlackRock Global Fixed Income chief investment officer Rick Rieder said it would likely take two weak jobs reports to prompt discussion about the Fed resuming its interest rate cutting cycle. But he added that the risks surrounding Trump's policies, including tariffs and an immigration crackdown, muddle the outlook. "While we and the Fed are keeping our eyes focused on these payroll (and inflation) reports, we also have to closely watch the news flow, and then the reverberations around these events, to get a sense for when the Fed and market makers can feel confident in rates coming down closer to a long-run neutral level," Rieder wrote. With investors' focus now squarely back on inflation data for hints of interest rate cuts, a fresh update on the pace of price increases is slated for release on Wednesday. Wall Street economists expect January's CPI to show headline inflation of 2.9% in January, flat from the month prior. Prices are anticipated to rise 0.3% on a month-over-month basis, per economist projections, below the 0.4% increase seen in December. On a "core" basis, which strips out food and energy prices, CPI is expected to have risen 3.1% over last year in January, below the 3.2% seen in December. Monthly core price increases are anticipated to clock in at 0.3%, above the 0.2% seen the month prior. The first monthly retail sales report of 2025 is set for release on Friday. Economists estimate retail sales were flat over the prior month during January. But the control group of retail sales — which excludes several volatile categories like gasoline and feeds directly into gross domestic product (GDP) — is also expected to have risen by 0.4%, down from the 0.7% increase seen in December. With more than 62% of S&P 500 companies done reporting earnings, the year-over-year growth rate for the index keeps moving higher. As of Friday, the S&P 500 was pacing for earnings growth of 16.4% compared to the year prior. This would mark the fastest pace of growth in three years and is well above the 11.8% earnings growth analysts had expected at the start of January. While earnings have been beating expectations, macro factors have continued to create stop-and-go market action as stocks have failed to find clear direction. On Friday, stocks slipped lower after the latest University of Michigan consumer sentiment survey showed respondents' one-year inflation expectations hit their highest level since November 2023. One-year inflation expectations jumped to 4.3% in February from 3.3% last month, marking the the fifth time in 14 years that the survey reported a rise of 1 percentage point or more in year-ahead inflation expectations. The release noted that the jump in inflation expectations was "in part due to a perception that it may be too late to avoid the negative impact of tariff policy." Stocks reversed course on the news, with all three major averages flipping from green to red. And while that constitutes just a small sampling of the market action, it's a reminder that what tariffs mean for inflation is squarely in focus for markets ahead of a week that's expected to provide updates on both fronts.

Title: Ireland U20’s make light work of Scotland to take opening Six Nations win

Following the disappointment of losing out to defending champions England in the opening round, Ireland captain Eanna McCarthy believes a more clinical attacking edge was the catalyst behind his side’s victory over Scotland in the Under-20 Six Nations at the Hive Stadium on Saturday. After the hurt that was left from their 19-3 reversal at the hands of the English on home soil, Ireland were determined to get their first win of the Championship in the Edinburgh venue. Thanks to a hat-trick of first-half tries from Charlie Molony – in addition to fine finishes over the whitewash by Billy Corrigan and Oisin Minogue in either half - Neil Doak’s visitors emerged from this round two clash in the Scottish capital with a maximum tally of five points. “There was a big week’s training and a few fix-ups from last week. We had nine entries [against England] and we only converted one, whereas this week we had 15 and converted a lot more. I’m very proud of the lads, but it was a fierce physical battle with Scotland. They’re always a good team, so you never want to take them for granted,” McCarthy remarked after Saturday’s game. “We know we’re a good side. We created so many opportunities against England and we just missed out [because of] last ball here, dropped ball there. There wasn’t much getting into it. There was a bit of hurt left from it, but there wasn’t much to say to the lads. They were fairly well motivated themselves.” After spectacularly touching down with just over 90 seconds gone on the clock, Molony got on the end of a delicate crossfield kick by Sam Wisniewski for his second try of the action on 13 minutes. The hard-working Corrigan added his name to the scoresheet by rounding off an enterprising attack just shy of the first-quarter mark, before Molony wrapped up his hat-trick and an Ireland bonus point in ruthless fashion on 22 minutes. Scotland finally opened their account with a five-pointer from Fergus Watson just four minutes later and even though Ireland established a comfortable 26-5 interval lead, there were some nervous moments after Joe Roberts added a second Scottish try on the restart. Yet the introduction of Munster hopeful Minogue (nephew of the late Anthony Foley and son of former Ireland women’s international Rosie Foley) proved to be a masterstroke by Irish head coach Doak as he dived over off an intricate lineout move mere seconds after his introduction as a 59th minute replacement. A resolute Scotland dotted down once again via scrumhalf Hector Patterson inside the final quarter but while Ireland came up short in their quest for a sixth try in the closing moments, they had already done more than enough to earn an emphatic victory. After kick-starting the tournament with two games in the space of nine days, Ireland will now be able to enjoy an extended build-up to their third round encounter with Wales at Rodney Parade in Newport on February 21st. Now that they have some points on the board, McCarthy is hopeful they are in a good position to push on for the remainder of the Six Nations – albeit there will be some tough challenges ahead for the Irish. “A bonus point win is hard to get wherever you go. Five points on the table now, we just work on from here. There’s a lot of things to work on for next week now. We’ll go back and train hard next week, and the week after it we’re into Wales away then. Which will be another tough game,” McCarthy added. Scorers - Scotland: F Watson, J Roberts, H Patterson try each. Ireland: C Molony 3 tries, B Corrigan, O Minogue try each, D Green 4 cons.

Skip to comments. Posted on 02/08/2025 9:57:03 AM PST by DallasBiff Staffers and allies of Elon Musk’s U.S. DOGE Service have fanned out across Washington in recent days, seeking access to sensitive data and disrupting operations in at least 14 government agencies in pursuit of a dramatically smaller federal government. DOGE, which stands for the Department of Government Efficiency, has not disclosed the names of its staff. But The Washington Post has identified more than 30 people working for or closely with it by examining the internal directories of multiple agencies and interviewing numerous federal workers, virtually all of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation.

Title: Mutual funds eye a chunk of ₹50,000 crore tax incentive showered in Budget

Iyengar Comments READ LATER Buoyed by growing investor interest, the mutual fund industry is gearing up to attract most of the ₹50,000 crore tax sops extended by the government to the middle-class in the Budget by promoting systematic investment plans and selling the India growth story. The Budget has exempted tax on salary income of up to ₹12.75 lakh per annum through a rebate and standard deduction of ₹75,000. Sundeep Sikka, ED and CEO, Nippon India Mutual Fund, said SIP is a convenient tool for small savers over the long run and the fund house believes the potential tax savings can be channelised through this route. “Our focus has always been to be a wealth creator to every Indian and the fact that one in a third mutual fund investor invests with us is a testimony to it,” he added. It is not just the investors, about six new fund houses are expected to jump into MF business this year. Among them, Angel One and Unifi Capital have filed papers with SEBI to launch their new products even while Jio BlackRock, Capitalmind, Choice International and Cosmea Financial Holdings are waiting in the wings. Akhil Chaturvedi, ED & CBO, Motilal Oswal Asset Management Company, said the fund house’s key focus is to expand the share in SIPs even while offering unique alternative investment products. Equity investors have matured, and despite market volatility, mutual fund investments continue to gain momentum as investors seek to capitalise on the recent market downturn for long-term gains, he added. Capital market regulator SEBI has recently laid norms to halve minimum SIP limit to ₹250 a month. About 225 million investors currently invest SIP but a majority are from big cities. Introducing SIPs in sachet size would help take financial investments to smaller towns. As an added advantage, SEBI is considering to allow MFs to offer insurance cover for SIP investors. For FY25, SIPs have more than quadrupled to ₹2.10 lakh crore so far from 2016-2017, per Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI) data. Aashish Somaiyaa, CEO, WhiteOak Capital AMC, said the ‘Mutual Fund Sahi Hai’ is a household adage in today’s world with both investors and MF distributors are meritocratic. The recent market volatility has amply demonstrated relative safety and outperformance of mutual funds against the benchmark indices and more so MF performance against the direct equity holdings of retail investors, he added.

Title: Is Broadcom Inc. (AVGO) the Best Stock to Invest In for Grandchildren?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 11 Best Stocks To Invest In For Grandchildren. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against the other stocks. In an era where financial literacy is increasingly recognized as a crucial life skill, teaching children about stock market investing can provide them with a significant advantage. Studies show that early financial education leads to better money management, long-term wealth accumulation, and greater financial security in adulthood. By introducing children to investing at a young age, they can develop a mindset of patience, risk assessment, and the power of compounding—principles that can shape their financial future. A 2023 study by the National Financial Educators Council (NFEC) found that a lack of financial literacy costs the average American $1,819 per year. Teaching children about investing early can help reduce this financial gap and equip them with the necessary skills to navigate economic challenges. Introducing children to stocks helps them understand concepts like risk and reward, diversification, and market fluctuations. Learning how companies operate and grow their revenue also fosters a deeper understanding of the economy. This knowledge can prevent common financial mistakes such as emotional investing, excessive debt, and poor money management. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. One of the most compelling reasons to teach children about investing is the power of compound interest. If a child begins investing at age 10 instead of waiting until age 30, they could amass significantly more wealth by retirement, simply by starting early. Teaching children about stocks encourages critical thinking and discipline in financial decisions. Instead of seeing money as something to be spent impulsively, they learn the value of investing for the future. A study by Fidelity Investments found that 82% of parents who teach their children about finances believe it leads to greater financial independence. Additionally, teaching investment concepts through real-life experiences, such as monitoring a stock portfolio, fosters engagement and practical learning. With advancements in AI, automation, and digital finance, future generations will need financial acumen to navigate an evolving economy. Experts suggest that children who understand investing will be better prepared for retirement, homeownership, and entrepreneurship.

For this article, we scoured investing forums, analyst reports, and advice from money managers and billionaires and compiled a list of stock options that are deemed the best for a child in the modern world. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

(NASDAQ:AVGO) is a global technology firm that designs, develops, and supplies a range of semiconductors, enterprise software and security solutions. In January, the company launched its innovative Emulex Secure Fibre Channel Host Bus Adapters (HBA), setting a new industry standard. It is a cost-effective, easy-to-manage solution that encrypts all data as it moves between servers and storage. Jeff Hoogenboom, vice president and general manager of the Emulex Connectivity Division at Broadcom, stated that the Emulex Secure Host Bus Adapter would meet the needs by providing an elegantly simple solution that, once installed, encrypts all data across all applications. In the fourth quarter of 2024, the company achieved record semiconductor revenue of $30.1 billion, with $12.2 billion coming from AI. The 220% surge in AI revenue year-on-year was fueled by the company’s advanced AI XPUs and Ethernet networking solutions. Overall AVGO ranks 7th on our list of the best stocks to invest in for grandchildren. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Title: Has Friedrich Merz, the man who would be chancellor of Germany, really opened the ‘doors to hell’?
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/world/europe/2025/02/08/has-friedrich-merz-the-man-who-would-be-chancellor-of-germany-really-opened-the-doors-to-hell/

No one closes rank quite like Germany’s Christian Democratic Union (CDU). Two weeks before 59 million Germans choose a new parliament – and, most likely, start a power transfer back to the CDU – the centre-right party is anxious to send a signal of unity. Standing ovations with slow, rhythmic applause are the order of the day at each campaign appearance of CDU leader Friedrich Merz. The lanky, bespectacled lawyer will turn 70 in November. After a 36-year wait, he has never been closer to power. A fortnight from the election, however, many think Merz’s influence has more to do with polarisation than politics. Last week the CDU leader performed a taboo-breaking rightward pivot on migration and asylum in the Bundestag, relying on votes from the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD). Though the CDU migration proposals were of no concrete consequence, they were highly symbolic. [ The Irish Times view on the German election: a worrying rightward shiftOpens in new window ] Bundestag rivals accused him of “opening the doors to hell” in the vote, with echoes of conservative pacts with the Nazis that ended prewar German democracy. On Sunday 160,000 outraged protesters braved the cold to gather outside Berlin’s CDU headquarters. One sign captured the mood: “It’s beginning to look a lot like Christmas 1933”. Even former CDU chancellor Angela Merkel broke her self-imposed political silence to call the AfD-backed Merz migration motion “wrong”. A decade ago her open-border politics and “we can manage this” refugee mantra drew popular support – and attracted global praise. But Germany is in a very different place a decade later. Even back then, resistance to her strategy was palpable. The eastern state of Saxony, for instance, saw marches organised by the “patriotic” civil rights group Pegida. The Saxon AfD was the first to tap migration as a more sustainable political calling card than EU bailouts. This week the Merz campaign tour stopped in Saxony, now an AfD heartland, where the far-right captured 30.7 per cent in last September’s state election – just one point behind the CDU. Growing migration fatigue – anger at criminal asylum seekers and a fumbled state response – has shifted Germany’s political centre. Less multicultural Berlin and more conservative Saxony: Merz is hoping to catch that wave, reshaping the CDU as centre-right party with a stronger conservative, law-and-order profile. In Dresden, the Saxon capital, Merz conceded that the AfD’s rise is a reflection of others’ political shortcomings. “Me and my party carry a big part of the responsibility,” he said. Amid growing applause, he urged Saxon voters not to “waste” their vote this time around on the AfD. “I want to make sure that the politics of my party is corrected to a point where the so-called Alternative for Germany is no longer needed,” he said, to whoops and cheers. In Dresden, and other campaign appearances, he promised new rules to “limit” migration – but remains vague on whether this correction will include turning back asylum seekers at the border. [ Bundestag MPs reject migration bill by Christian Democratic Union and backed by far-right Alternative for GermanyOpens in new window ] That was a demand in last week’s nonbinding proposals backed by the AfD, which triggered a wave of protest. In Dresden, some 3,000 demonstrated near the Merz event, many carrying signs that simply read: “Disgrace.” “Many people were very unsettled by that vote, particularly those who would have voted for the CDU under the assumption they wouldn’t ally themselves with the AfD,” said Albrecht Pallas, a Saxon MP for the centre-left Social Democratic Party (SPD), which leads Germany’s ruling coalition. “People out here today are worried about the future of our democracy.” Saxon CDU voters – traditionally on the conservative end of the political spectrum – worry about democracy, but for different reasons. “It’s important that democracy survives against growing anti-democratic tendencies,” said Tilo Höhne, a 56-year-old Dresden CDU supporter. “On the other hand, you cannot exclude a quarter of voters from democratic processes indefinitely, or else they will reject democracy itself – which only survives with broad public support.” The party’s current support is steady, but not stellar, nearly three points behind Merkel’s worst election result. Last week’s rebellion of 12 CDU MPs against the migration motion, analysts suggest, reflects wider dissent. “He doesn’t have his party completely behind him,” says Prof Klaus Schubert, political scientist at the University of Münster. “The irony of all this is how Merz, a self-anointed economic expert, has trapped himself with the migration topic when the economy should be the biggest election issue.” Aware of that, Merz is working to shift attention in the last fortnight of the campaign. With Germany heading for a third year of flat growth – a postwar first – the CDU is promising a nine-point action plan for its first 100 days. It wants lower income tax and corporate tax, simplified bureaucracy and a push for higher investment in research and infrastructure – potentially with a reformed debt brake to allow greater borrowing. Critics say the plans are unfunded and lacking detail, unlike the CDU’s detailed plans to undo welfare reforms of the Olaf Scholz coalition. Merz says Germany must be “ready to take on leadership responsibility” in Europe by renewing frayed ties to Paris and Warsaw – in particular to provide a coherent EU response to the Trump administration. On the campaign trail, he has toned down his previous robust rhetoric on arms deliveries to Ukraine. Merz was born in 1955 into a Catholic family in the western Sauerland district. He battled tuberculosis aged 10, went on to study law and was a 33-year-old district court judge in 1989 when he won a seat for the CDU in the third directly elected European Parliament. After one term in Strasbourg he returned to Bonn as one of many young disciples around Helmut Kohl. When Angela Merkel snatched the CDU leadership in 2000 she appointed Merz as her deputy. Sensing his ambition, she dropped him after two years. The animosity was so great that, when she stepped out as leader in 2018, she tried to thwart – twice – his ambition to be CDU leader. [ Angela Merkel thwarted Friedrich Merz’s ambition to succeed her. Now they have buried the hatchetOpens in new window ] He succeeded on the third attempt, to ongoing despair of Merkelist CDU centrists. While Merz hopes his conservative stripes are back in fashion, rivals inside and outside his party never tire of skewering him as an ageing Tory Boy. After he was ousted by Merkel, Merz became a millionaire corporate lawyer who advised the BlackRock investment fund. He described himself as “upper middle class” in an interview, yet flies his own private jet. In the cockpit of his €1 million Austrian-built Diamond DA 62, his call name – in line with aviation rules – is “Foxtrot Mike”. Merz allies insist the rightward shift of the CDU didn’t start last week. Nor, they say, is he turning back the clock entirely. Its new party programme from last May is open to “diverse families” and multiculturalism, but has declared as unwelcome “an Islam that doesn’t share our families and rejects our free society”. The Merz campaign is high-risk and fluid: a centre-right cocktail that is being remixed on a daily basis, with no certainty it will appeal to voter tastes. German political analysts disagree on whether his migration shift was an act of madness – alienating centrist voters and complicating coalition talks – or a master stroke to pull in one third of German voters who are still undecided. For now, fears that Merz damaged the CDU with its Bundestag migration motions appear unfounded. A week on, a Thursday poll showed the CDU had gained one point to 31 per cent in polls – but so, too, had the AfD. It remains in second place on 21 per cent. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Michelin Guide 2025: Will Ireland finally get its first three-star restaurant?
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/food/restaurants/2025/02/08/michelin-guide-2025-will-ireland-finally-get-its-first-three-star-restaurant/

The Michelin Guide Great Britain & Ireland 2025 will be revealed on Monday, February 10th, at the Kelvingrove Art Gallery & Museum in Glasgow, an event that can make or break reputations overnight. While British restaurants have long secured three-star status, Ireland remains on the outside looking in. With speculation building, will this finally be the year an Irish restaurant claims the ultimate accolade? Understanding the Michelin system requires some decoding. Not every restaurant listed in the guide holds an award – many are simply included as part of Michelin’s curated selection, a recognition in itself but without the same prestige. Beyond a listing, Michelin has three key distinctions: the Bib Gourmand, the Michelin Star, and the Green Star. The Bib Gourmand, introduced in 1997, is awarded to restaurants that offer particularly good food at moderate prices. It can, on occasion be a stepping stone to a Michelin star, as was the case with Bastible in Dublin, which was awarded a Bib in 2017 and went on to secure a Michelin star in 2022, but that is the exception rather than the rule. [ Ireland’s first Michelin star: ‘It made the front page of the London Times, but only got a mention in the Examiner’Opens in new window ] Michelin stars are awarded in three tiers based solely on food. A single star denotes high-quality cooking “worth a stop”; two stars indicate excellent cooking “worth a detour”; and three stars, the most coveted award, are reserved for “exceptional cuisine worth a special journey.” These broad descriptions leave room for interpretation. Awards ignore service, decor and ambience – a food shack is as eligible as a fine-dining restaurant. The final distinction, the Green Star, introduced in 2020, highlights restaurants leading the way in sustainability. In Ireland, only Kai in Galway holds one. Michelin inspectors, working anonymously across 39 destinations, log more than 250 meals a year, documenting each in detail. They book under aliases and pay their own bills to maintain impartiality. With at least a decade of industry experience, they must possess a refined palate, assess cuisine objectively, and have deep knowledge of global culinary traditions. Restaurants are assessed based on five criteria: ingredient quality, culinary technique, flavour harmony, the chef’s personality in the dishes, and consistency across visits. Decisions are made collectively by the inspection team, ensuring uniform standards globally. Michelin stars are awarded unanimously, with additional visits conducted if opinions differ. [ Michelin-starred restaurants in Ireland, 2024: The complete guideOpens in new window ] Each year there are notable absences due to restaurant closures or significant changes. Wild Honey Inn in Co Clare, long regarded as one of Ireland’s best gastropubs, has now shut its doors and will no longer feature. Eipic in Belfast, which previously held a Michelin star, has also closed. Another possible loss is the Cliff House in Ardmore, Co Waterford, which would have required a further inspection following the departure of chef Tony Parkin, and the time frame to do this may have been too tight. Michelin is known for re-evaluating restaurants following key personnel changes, and if they find standards have slipped, the star could be removed. Lignum in Bullaun, east Galway, has been drawing increasing attention from the Michelin Guide this year, particularly for its focus on wood-fired cooking. Built around a fire-driven approach using embers from kiln-dried birch, ash, and oak, it offers a €145, 10-course tasting menu showcasing seasonal Irish and Italian ingredients. Since opening in 2017, it has been widely tipped for a Michelin star. Lignum is led by Danny Africano in the kitchen and his wife, Molly Keane, running front of house. It pairs its ambitious cooking with a beautifully designed diningroom. With Enda McEvoy’s Loam now closed, JP McMahon’s Aniar is Galway’s only remaining Michelin-starred restaurant. Galway is primed for a second one, and this could well be the year that Lignum claims the accolade. There is considerable speculation about who else might secure a Michelin star, particularly restaurants that have had a change of chef. Ballyfin received three Michelin Keys, a new award that places it among the world’s top hotels. Chef Richard Picard-Edwards, who has extensive Michelin starred experience, joined Ballyfin as executive head chef in April 2023 from the Mandarin Oriental Bittescombe Lodge, and is serving benchmark Michelin-level food on a €145, eight-course menu. When I visited, the Jerusalem artichoke cream was a standout dish, with precisely cut pickled artichoke, caviar, gold leaf, micro herbs, and croutons sitting on top of a silky cream, with umami-rich chicken jelly. [ Two Irish hotels awarded highest honours in new Michelin key awardsOpens in new window ] The listing on the Michelin website describes Ballyfin as offering an exceptional dining experience that matches its luxurious setting, highlighting the kitchen’s technical precision and consistently high standards. With polished, attentive service completing the picture, things are looking very positive for them. Another stunning restaurant and strong contender is the Morrison Room at Carton House, where Adam Nevin (ex The Grill at The Dorchester, The Hand and Flowers and The Westbury in London) delivers a textbook Michelin experience. You’ll find plenty of luxury ingredients on his €110, eight-course tasting menu. The barbecued lobster tail was a highlight when I visited. Jonathan Farrell, formerly of Bastible in Dublin, spent time at top Copenhagen restaurants – including Amass and Relæ – before working at Simon Rogan’s three-star L’Enclume in England’s Lake District. Since taking over as head chef at Gregans Castle last year, he has been firmly on Michelin’s radar. With The Wild Honey Inn now closed, there’s one star fewer in Co Clare, which could well be heading his way. However, there has been little talk of it on the guide’s social media, so maybe it won’t be this year. [ 100 great restaurants, cafes and places to eat in Ireland 2024Opens in new window ] Meanwhile, Alex Greene and Bronagh McCormick, formerly head chef and general manager of the defunct Eipic, have taken the helm at The Buck’s Head Inn in Dundrum, Co Down. With their combined expertise, they are elevating the offering, pairing Greene’s skill with top-quality local produce on an a la carte menu that reflects his talent. This is one to watch. There are a few restaurants that have been receiving increased attention from Michelin inspectors. Mae in Dublin has had multiple visits, which has speculation going, and not surprisingly, Alta, known for its focus on wood-fired cooking, has also been added to the Michelin listings. Landline at Park Hotel in Kenmare is another possibility. It was recently added to the guide. One of the biggest questions leading into this year’s announcement is whether Chapter One by Mickael Viljanen can achieve three-star status. London’s Ledbury, which had long been seen as one of the city’s best restaurants, finally secured three stars last year. Chapter One is in a similar position – highly respected, extensively visited by Michelin inspectors, and widely praised by top chefs. However, Michelin has yet to award three stars to any Irish restaurant, and whether this will be the year they break that pattern is uncertain. Last year, Michelin’s chief inspector revealed little but confirmed that Chapter One remains under close scrutiny, with inspectors closely monitoring its evolution. He hinted that once everything aligns, it will join the ranks of three-star restaurants. “To become a three-star restaurant is to basically say that this is one of the best restaurants in the world. It’s a restaurant that is going to provide an incredible experience. Not only just the sophistication and originality and personality of the cuisine, but there’s also everything else that goes with it,” he said. “So when we make these decisions – and the inspectors absolutely love seeing a new restaurant join the family of three-star restaurants – we have to be very, very sure of our decision.” [ Forget TripAdvisor and Google reviews: How leading Irish chefs find the best restaurants when travelling abroadOpens in new window ] Terre in Castlemartyr, which was awarded two stars last year, may also have its sights set on the highest accolade. Given the difficulty of making the leap from two stars to three, it may take another few years of sustained excellence before it reaches that level. Similarly, Liath and Dede, both currently at two stars, are undoubtedly aiming for the ultimate accolade. However, the bar for three stars is extraordinarily high, and securing the award requires consistently superlative cooking. While some restaurants are widely expected to receive a Michelin star, others seem to be repeatedly overlooked. Library St, Dax, Uno Mas and Forest Avenue are four of the most talked-about omissions. Many in the industry argue that if these restaurants were in London, they would already have a star. Michelin’s choices often spark debate, and if these names remain absent again this year, it will only add to the perception that certain deserving restaurants are being ignored. While the focus tends to be on new one-star recipients and potential three-star elevations, the step from one to two stars is also a significant achievement. Adare Manor and Mount Juliet are two establishments that may be in contention for a second star, though they remain outside bets. Michelin’s decisions in this category are often difficult to predict, as the criteria for moving from one to two stars involve an extra level of finesse and consistency. [ Ten restaurants around Ireland worth travelling to for a unique experienceOpens in new window ] Despite its critics, the Michelin Guide remains a powerful influence in the restaurant industry. A star, or even a listing, can drive bookings, raise a restaurant’s profile, and draw international attention. While some dismiss it as outdated, its influence is undeniable. Even those who claim indifference feel its impact – whether through a surge in reservations after an award or the frustration of being overlooked. Michelin is famously secretive about its process, and surprises are always possible. However, one thing is certain – on February 10th, the future of Irish fine dining will take another step forward, and the country’s top chefs will be watching closely to see who is in, who is out, and who has finally reached the pinnacle of culinary recognition. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Stocks to Invest in According to AI. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other stocks. The rise of artificial intelligence in finance has led many investors to question whether AI-powered tools like ChatGPT can effectively pick stocks. While ChatGPT and similar large language models (LLMs) can process vast amounts of financial data, market news, and historical trends, their ability to consistently outperform human experts or quantitative models remains debatable. Instead, investors should look towards AI-driven hedge funds, such as Renaissance Technologies and Two Sigma, that have historically outperformed the market using machine learning models. For example, the Medallion Fund of the former achieved an annualized return of 66% before fees from 1988 to 2018. These funds rely on proprietary algorithms, high-frequency trading, and massive datasets. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. One indicator of hedge funds being ahead of the curve when it comes to stocks and the broader market in general is a recent Goldman Sachs note to investors which details that top hedge funds navigated the recent tech selloff without significant losses, even managing to post nominal gains since the turn of the year despite a big dropoff in the market amid concerns over trade tariffs and an AI bubble. Per a report by news agency Reuters, US President Trump has delayed tariffs on Canada and Mexico by one month, fueling wild swings in currency, bond and share markets. Despite the turmoil, stock-picking hedge funds that take bets based on company fundamentals recorded an average 2.6% return, their best month since February 2024, given a broader market rally, the report claimed.

In late January, the firm posted earnings for the second fiscal quarter, reporting earnings per share of $3.23, beating market estimates by $0.13. The revenue over the period was close to $70 billion, up more than 12% compared to the revenue over the same period last year and beating analyst expectations by $790 million. Latest reports suggest that tech behemoth Softbank plans to invest close to $40 billion into Microsoft-backed AI startup OpenAI. The startup has become the most valuable private firm in the world and is valued at close to $350 billion. Overall MSFT ranks 2nd on our list of the best stocks to invest in according to AI. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Title: The Irish Times view on Dublin’s disappearing buses: time to banish the ghosts

The incidence of ghost buses – scheduled services that fail to show up – is a cause of understandable frustration to the travelling public and Dublin commuters. The explanations advanced to date by the two operators in the Dublin market – state-owned Dublin bus and the privately-owned Go Ahead – are plausible but don’t seem to account adequately for the extent of the long-running problem which has become acute in recent weeks. Go Ahead attributes it to a shortage of mechanics while Dublin Bus points to problems with a 15 year old real-time passenger information system which does not always provide accurate information on bus arrivals. It is to be replaced over the next two years at a cost of €68 million. The elephant in the room is traffic congestion in Dublin and its impact on buses in general, including those introduced as part of BusConnects, a multiyear project to redesign the bus network around a series of spine and radial routes. Dublin is one of the most congested cities in Europe .The consequences for bus timetables are obvious and can only be exacerbated for the long cross-city and radial routes at the heart of the BusConnects project. Delays in rolling out bus lanes are another factor. It is perhaps not a coincidence that one of the worst performing route for ghost buses is a radial route across south Dublin introduced as part of BusConnects. The S6 runs from Blackrock in South Dublin via UCD to Tallaght in West Dublin and is the most featured on an app which irate passengers use to report ghost buses. BusConnects is an important and necessary project and part of the wider effort to reach our national climate goals. The question as to whether it may have underestimated the consequences of traffic congestion is one that the Minister for Transport Darragh O’Brien could usefully bring up with the National Transport Authority when he meets them next week to discuss the issue. So is the slow progress on rolling out the whole project and the need to speed up the introduction of the new real-time information system. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: XRP ETF Launch: Ripple Bulls Eye $50 Billion Inflow As Institutions Show Massive Interest In XRP

Amidst the current positive mood in the market, a noteworthy event has sparked discussion and expectation: the potential for an exchange-traded fund (ETF) backed by Ripple’s XRP to enter the fray. The interview that Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse had with Bloomberg had become the focal point of this discussion. Throughout the interview, Garlinghouse expressed cautious optimism about the potential of an XRP ETF. He did not share specific ideas but indicated that he was receptive. Though speculation about possible partnerships has been rife, Garlinghouse didn’t acknowledge nor deny that it is in talks with significant asset management companies such as BlackRock. Remarkably, a leaked document from November 2023 raised rumors about BlackRock’s potential investment in an XRP ETF. But a later investigation refuted this rumor. SCOOP: @BlackRock has no plans for a spot $XRP ETF, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter story developing European investors can purchase XRP exchange-traded products (ETPs) from companies like CoinShares and 21 Shares; however, no XRP ETF is available in the US market. Nevertheless, the process of introducing an XRP ETF in the US is hampered by legal obstacles and market conjecture, which were made worse by the legal dispute between Ripple and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). After news about the possibility of an XRP ETF, social media platforms lit up with conversations from people from all walks of life sharing their thoughts. An exciting tweet posted by John Deaton caught attention. It’s worth noting that he announced his Senate candidacy on the same day Brad Garlinghouse broached the topic of an XRP ETF. Former Ripple director Sean McBride also shared his observations, projecting the release of an XRP ETF by 2025 in addition to a 2025 Ripple IPO outside of the United States. Amidst the excitement, a user started fabricating stories about FOMO (fear of missing out) that emphasized the alleged chances to amass cash. This tweet and others like it advise followers to stay on their assets, predicting large returns and hinting that selling now could mean losing out on future income. Such speculative claims must be carefully considered, considering the inherent dangers and uncertainties of the crypto market. Recent months have seen a rush of activity and conjecture surrounding the Ripple v. SEC legal battle, with significant developments suggesting the likelihood of a complete resolution. Notably, after a closed meeting on November 30, the SEC did not make any motions and instead remained silent, which stoked rumors of a likely settlement between the SEC and Ripple. Legal expert Fred Rispoli has drawn attention to the SEC’s absence of motions, suggesting that there may be an unwritten understanding between Ripple and the agency that might result in a settlement following the evaluation of the requested information. After ten years of development, the first Bitcoin spot ETF was finally approved in January 2024, highlighting the regulatory obstacles and cautious approach to financial products based on cryptos. The path to an XRP ETF is challenging to navigate in light of these obstacles, reflecting the larger difficulties the crypto sector faces in getting new financial products approved by regulators. Given the SEC’s attention to Ethereum ETFs, it is clear that more established assets will probably be prioritized over XRP and other options. Therefore, Ripple’s future will be shaped by the changing regulatory landscape, which will also impact broader market developments such as XRP ETFs, Ripple’s IPO, and the state of the crypto industry as a whole.

Title: RWA Tokenization Is Going to Trillions Much Faster Than You Think
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/opinion/2025/02/07/rwa-tokenization-is-going-to-trillions-much-faster-than-you-think
Time Published: 2025-02-07T18:59:25Z
Full Content:
What if I told you that the experts are wrong? Over the years several prestigious consulting firms and financial institutions have put out forecasts about the growth of tokenization by the end of the decade. It’s interesting how between all that “expertise,” their ranges vary between $2 trillion (McKinsey) and $16 trillion (BCG). Fourteen trillion dollars is a heck of a lot of spread! Since 2017, there have been trials to tokenize assets all around the world. Along the way we’ve seen almost every asset class brought on-chain. Today there are more than $50 billion in tokenized stocks, bonds and real estate, with some of the world’s biggest financial institutions, like BlackRock, Franklin Templeton and Apollo starting to invest serious resources into tokenization. Add in over $200 billion in stablecoins (or what we can call tokenized dollars) and we’ve got one quarter of a trillion dollars in RWAs. What will it look like when the faucet actually turns on? We believe it looks like going from $250 billion today to $30 trillion in 2030, all thanks to the new crypto clarity in the U.S. Whether it’s the Fed, the new Crypto Czar, both houses in Congress, or the President himself, this new administration has understood and embraced the benefits of stablecoins to further improve the dollar dominance in the world. If the U.S. dollar is the world reserve currency for the Web2 world, why not also for the Web3 world? Simply put, the more people that buy stablecoins, the majority of which are in dollars, the better it is for the U.S.A. With the right attitude on crypto, we should see market clarity on token classifications (an official taxonomy) and stablecoin market structure in new legislation coming before Congress. Passing such a bill will offer a green light for blockchain to be used in capital markets in the U.S. Previous prediction reports did not factor in this new wave of clarity and government-wide support for crypto, stablecoins, and RWAs. Stablecoins and yieldcoins (treasury backed tokens) are set to grow significantly from their current $220 billion position, potentially up to $3 to $5 trillion by 2030 if you factor in commercial adoption, digital assets growth, and the demand for yield on-chain. This RWA use case has not only found product-market fit by crypto users, but it will also become a settlement solution and payment rail for capital markets in general. All assets can now transact on a new, nearly-instantaneous financial operating system using blockchain to go in and out of any tokenized Real World Asset (RWA) or crypto asset using stablecoins. The tokenization revolution is inevitable. Which is actually what the CEOs of BlackRock and JP Morgan have been openly saying and acting on. Most critics will laugh at the notion that the over one hundred trillion in stocks or hundreds of trillions in real estate, or trillions in private companies, or trillions in commodities, or trillions in bonds and credit could all be tokenized. In a few years those critics will be saying tokenization is a necessity and that it's the innovation of the century for finance (because it is). The answer is yes, it can all be tokenized. It’s more of a question of how fast will each asset class take advantage of migrating on chain. Some assets will feel more pressure to adapt while other assets are so large it doesn’t take much to move the needle to suddenly get to trillions either via new asset issuance, tokenized asset growth, or simply legacy assets migrating on-chain. My conversations with banks, asset managers, crypto exchanges, and industry leaders tells me that there is a renewed spirit for asset tokenization with the difference being that the traditional finance sector and regulators now better understands the benefits of blockchain technology, implying that the growth of asset tokenization will happen faster than previously forecast. Here are some other reasons our forecasts are higher than previous estimates: When we look at some of the past forecasts, some of them like HSBC and Northern Trust use a methodology that relies on calculating the size of the asset class and applying a nominal percentage of adoption or in their case a range of 5-10% of total assets. Others like Standard Chartered allude to specific asset classes growing faster than others or in their case citing 14% of $30 trillion of assets by 2034 coming from trade finance. STM’s methodology breaks down the eight largest asset classes in the world and considers regulatory and government support as a key factor of growth. Imagine if California’s title registry went on-chain. That’s a residential home market of $10 trillion that could be put on a blockchain virtually overnight. Thanks to new market clarity in the U.S. and the success of stablecoins, we expect faster blockchain adoption around the world, leading to $50 trillion in RWA annual trading by the end of the decade.

Title: Large Whale Dumps 8,500 Ether Amid Surging Institutional Demand

Time Published: 2025-02-07T18:48:16Z

In a sharp turn of events, a crypto whale has sold 8,500 ETH, raising speculations about the asset’s direction. In recent weeks, sideways traders dominated crypto assets within the ETH price outlook, slipping below resistance levels. However, Ethereum bulls saw buying opportunities like most market dips, making new low entry points ahead of anticipated inflows. At the time of writing, ETH’s price crashed 3% to $2,742 in the last 24 hours, extending weekly exits above 15%. In the last 24 hours, a whale moved $23.2 million worth of Ethereum at around $2,736 per coin. This was followed by other sales from retail holders, wiping off the momentum gained the previous day. Most traders suggest that the grip on the wider market’s correction on top altcoins might be short-term. However, its impact lowered institutional demand, wiped off gains, and slowed decentralized financial (DeFi) numbers. Today, Ethereum’s trading volumes sit slightly above $30 billion after its market capitalization fell below $131 billion. The leading altcoin has struggled to replicate previous gains in recent times as sentiments move to other assets. Altcoin repositioning became glaring after spot Ethereum ETFs failed to attract inflows like Bitcoin products. Despite the milestone, ETH price struggled suggesting the asset was overbought. This led to a change in sentiments from Ethereum to XRP and Solana, altcoins now described as institutional investor favorites. Last year, SOL outpaced ETH growth without spot ETFs leading to surging optimism of the former’s products awaiting approval. XRP spiked in the same period to the third largest crypto asset by market cap. Trading above $3 at the start of the year, analysts tipped a spike to $6 during the altcoin season as funds move out of Bitcoin. However, the market’s correction led to a sharp 22% weekly decline. Amid the crippling downturn, crypto whales took advantage to ramp up ETH holdings. On Feb 6, the asset broke $2,800 after BlackRock purchased 100,535 ETH worth approximately $284 million. This large investment, alongside others, boosts trader confidence, as seen in hourly trading data. Furthermore, Donald Trump’s World Liberty Finance added to its ETH holdings following the last correction caused by U.S. trade disputes. Recent acquisitions and on-chain factors led analysts to raise projections for the assets. Renowned trader Ali Martinez wrote on X that Ethereum is gearing up for a breakout above $4,000.

Title: Ethereum Price Could Be Primed For Another 100% Move After Printing Capitulation Candle
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-primed-for-100-move/
Time Published: 2025-02-07T17:00:02Z
Full Content:
Ethereum’s price action in the past seven days has led to the creation of a capitulation candle that might send it on another surge within the next eight to twelve weeks. This capitulation candle caught the attention of crypto analyst Ted Pillows, who noted an interesting repeating capitulation pattern for Ethereum. According to technical analysis by Ted Pillows, Ethereum has printed a capitulation candle in early 2025, just as it did in the first quarter of 2024 and the third quarter of 2023. TedPillows’ analysis highlights that the Ethereum price has undergone three major capitulation events in the past two years, all of which led to substantial price rebounds. Particularly, these capitulations have taken place in the weekly candlestick timeframe, where the Ethereum price witnessed intense selling pressure throughout the week. However, historical price playout shows that these capitulations have often marked the bottom before a massive price rally. The first of such capitulations occurred in Q1 2024 and eventually led to a 100% rally over the next three months, with the Ethereum price reaching $3,950. The second capitulation took place in Q3 2024, leading to a similar upswing. With Ethereum now experiencing another capitulation moment in early 2025, the analyst suggests that the pattern is set to repeat. He believes that Ethereum is once again forming a market bottom, setting the stage for an aggressive upward move. If Ethereum follows its previous trajectory, the next eight to twelve weeks could bring a significant price increase, even as the leading altcoin currently struggles around $2,700. A 90%-100% pump after the recent capitulation would push the Ethereum price past key resistance levels and above its current all-time high. TedPillows’ analysis suggests that Ethereum’s ultimate price target following this capitulation could reach as high as $8,000. However, it is likely to encounter significant resistance near $3,950, a level that has historically triggered rejections in past capitulation cycles. Should Ethereum struggle to break through this barrier again, a temporary pullback could be on the horizon before any sustained move higher. Meanwhile, Spot Ethereum ETFs are attracting heavy inflows despite Ethereum’s price downturn. Institutional investors appear to be capitalizing on the dip and increasing their ETH holdings in anticipation of a broader market rebound. Spot Ethereum ETFs have recorded $513.8 million in inflows in the last six trading days, with BlackRock leading the charge by acquiring $424.1 million worth of ETH. This steady accumulation from institutional holders suggests growing confidence in Ethereum’s long-term potential and could lay the foundation for the projected 100% surge in the next eight to twelve months. At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $2,725, down by 4% in the past 24 hours.

It was a busy week in crypto featuring important product launches, fevered debate around Ethereum, movement on stablecoin legislation, and high-profile Congressional hearings on “debanking.” David Sacks, the Crypto and AI Czar, held a high-profile press conference with Senate leadership, as Senator Hagerty, of Tennessee, introduced a new stablecoin bill. The proposal, which outlines an oversight regime for stablecoin issuance, builds on a bill that passed the House last year but fell in the Senate. It’s more likely to pass this year, now that Republicans are in control. CoinDesk’s Jesse Hamilton had the news. The Senate also held hearings on the co-ordinated policy of institutions like the FDIC to deny financial services to crypto companies during the Biden years (aka debanking). Nathan McCauley, CEO Anchorage Digital, an institutional custodian, testified (and also wrote about his experience on CoinDesk). Consensys founder Joe Lubin said his company had been debanked twice as well, Ian Allison reported. Ondo Finance introduced a new tokenization blockchain, in readiness for an expected wave of institutional interest in RWAs. Kris Sandor and Helene Braun had the story. Trump-backed World Liberty Financial immediately bought $470,000 worth of ONDO, the platform’s governance token. Kris Sandor and Francisco Rodrigues reported on that. The week’s other big launch came from Berachain, which debuted a mainnet and a 79 million-strong airdrop, Shaurya Malwa reported. At the time of writing, BERA’s market cap was already more than $800 million. Shaurya also provided a prescient analysis of XRP price, well ahead of its decline by analyzing trading patterns. Meanwhile, Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy rebranded, dropping the “Micro” but not the commitment to purchasing as much bitcoin as possible. Soon, James Van Straten reported that BlackRock had taken a 5% ownership in the company. News around Ethereum was less rosy, as has been the case for a few months now. JPMorgan said ether has underperformed because of competition from rivals like Solana, and because it lacks a compelling narrative (like bitcoin), Will Canny reported. But Ethereum did move forward on its Pectra upgrade and its cheerleaders run deep, even on Wall Street, Margaux Nijkerk said. So better days may be ahead (Eric Trump certainly tweeted an endorsement). Bitcoin is called "digital gold" by some, but outside of it, the actual precious metal moves cryptocurrencies too. Gold's historic run has seen prices outperforming the traditional market, taking gold-backed crypto with it. Francisco Rodrigues highlighted how and why tokens like PAXG and XAUT were among the best-performing tokens this year, outperforming even the "digital gold," due to the bullion's rally. Finally, in an important case for internet privacy, Alexey Pertsev, one of the developers of Tornado Cash, an Ethereum mixer, was released from jail pending an appeal. He had been sentenced to 64 months inside last year. Happy weekend, all. Benjamin Schiller is CoinDesk's managing editor for features and opinion.
