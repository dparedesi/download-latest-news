The Federal Reserve will disappoint markets by cutting interest rates just one more time in 2024, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said. Fink said the Fed will likely cut interest rates by 25 basis points before the end of the year amid a rise in global inflation. "I think it's fair to say we're going to have at least a 25, but, that being said, I do believe we have greater embedded inflation in the world than we've ever seen," Fink said during a Tuesday panel in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The market sees two more cuts this year, pricing in a 25 basis point cut at the November and December meetings, according to CME's FedWatch tool. Investors see slimmer odds of about 30% that the Fed will leave rates unchanged in December. Fink pointed to inflationary policies in the US, which he said are changing the economy's consumer-driven nature. "We have a government and policy that is much more inflationary. Immigration — our policies of onshoring, all of this — no one is asking the question 'at what cost,'" he said. "Historically we were, I would say, a more consumer-driven economy, the cheapest products were the best and the most progressive way of politicking." His comments point to the policies aimed at bringing supply chains closer to the US and "re-shoring" domestic manufacturing jobs via spending bills like the Inflation Reduction Act and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. Those measures will likely mean inflation sticks around and prompts the Fed to pause its easing cycle, Fink suggested. "Today, I think we have governmental policies that are embedded inflationary, and, with that being said, we're not gonna see interest rates as low as people are forecasting." The latest inflation reading for September showed the consumer price index grew 2.4% year over year, down slightly from 2.5% in August, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. After Fink's comments, another panel at the conference reaffirmed his forecast. When asked to raise their hand if they expected the Fed to cut interest rates twice more before the end of the year, the CEOs of Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, State Street, and other Wall Street giants kept their hands down, according to CNBC. The central bank kicked off its easing cycle with a jumbo 50 basis point cut last month. This week will be important for the Fed's decision-making process, with a slew of data releases scheduled, including personal consumption expenditures, third-quarter GDP, and the October jobs report.

Title: Bitcoin Price Skyrockets Above $71,000: Key Reasons Explained
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-skyrockets-above-71000-key-reasons/
Time Published: 2024-10-29T16:30:50Z

The Bitcoin price has surged past the $71,000 mark today. Over the past five days, Bitcoin’s price has rallied by more than 8.5%, climbing from $65,600 to as high as $71,118 on October 29. In the last 24 hours alone, the BTC price has increased by 3.8%. This upward momentum can be attributed to four key factors: The surge in Bitcoin’s price is closely linked to substantial inflows into Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). Yesterday witnessed massive ETF flows totaling $479.4 million. BlackRock led the inflows with $315.2 million, followed by Fidelity at $44.1 million, Ark with $59.8 million, and Bitwise at $38.7 million. These significant investments coincided with Bitcoin’s price movement from $68,000 to over $71,000. Leading on-chain analyst James “Checkmate” Check highlighted a divergence between Bitcoin ETF inflows and CME Open Interest. He noted “We have a divergence between Bitcoin ETF Inflows and CME Open Interest. ETF Inflows are ticking meaningfully higher, CME Open Interest is up, but not as much GBTC outflows are also minimal. We’re seeing true directional ETF inflows, and less so cash and carry trades.” The divergence suggests that investors are favoring direct exposure to Bitcoin through ETFs rather than engaging in cash and carry trades involving futures contracts. The carry trade strategy in the context of US spot Bitcoin ETFs and CME futures involves buying the ETF (tracking the spot price of Bitcoin) and simultaneously shorting Bitcoin futures on the CME. This approach aims to capitalize on price differences when futures trade at a premium to the spot price (contango). The notable shift toward ETFs indicates a bullish sentiment among investors, anticipating further price appreciation. Political developments are also influencing Bitcoin’s recent rally. Singapore-based QCP Capital commented on the impact of former President Donald Trump’s interview on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast, which has gained over 32 million views and driven his Polymarket odds above 66%. Despite “crypto” being touted as the “Trump Trade,” Bitcoin’s correlation with Trump’s potential election victory seems to fuel the Bitcoin price rally. QCP Capital also noted that Bitcoin is up only 8% this “Uptober,” compared to an average of 21% in previous Octobers. They stated, “If spot holds at these levels, this October would mark Bitcoin’s fourth-worst performance in the past decade.” With total BTC perpetual futures open interest across exchanges standing at $27 billion—approaching this year’s peak—a breakout above $70,000 could trigger new all-time highs, especially with more leveraged longs joining in. Market data indicates a significant shorts squeeze contributing to Bitcoin’s price spike. According to Coinglass, in the past 24 hours, 65,622 traders were liquidated, with total liquidations across the entire crypto market amounting to $228.51 million. Of this, $169.47 million were short liquidations. Specifically for Bitcoin, $83.61 million in shorts were liquidated. The largest single liquidation order occurred on Binance’s BTCUSDT pair, valued at $18 million. The substantial liquidation of short positions suggests that many traders were betting on a price decline and were forced to close their positions as the market moved against them. This mass unwinding of shorts can accelerate upward price movements as traders buy back into the market to cover their positions. Large-scale investors, often referred to as “whales,” are playing a pivotal role in the current rally. CryptoQuant analyst Mignolet observed that Bitcoin’s rally continues, led by activity on the Binance exchange. He pointed out that Binance whales began significant involvement in the market two weeks ago during Asian trading hours, and recent declines in the Coinbase Premium Gap (CPG) alongside price increases are “a clear sign of Binance whales’ intervention. Mignolet emphasized that this should not be interpreted as a decline in US demand, but an even stronger buying pressure from Binance. Over the past two weeks, demand for US Bitcoin spot ETFs has surged, with a net inflow of approximately 47,000 Bitcoin. Since most ETF products use Coinbase, movements in CPG data are closely tied to ETF demand. He concluded, “The current Bitcoin price is being driven by Binance whales, with sustained inflows of US capital.” At press time, BTC traded at $71,340.

Title: ‘Economic steel’: New Zealand’s Bitcoin opportunity, according to Michael Saylor

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. Bitcoin advocate Michael Saylor says the crypto currency presents an opportunity for New Zealand investors, and suggests domestic businesses should acquire it to boost their balance sheets. “It represents an extraordinary financial opportunity for people in New Zealand, and that’s kind of why I’m pleasantly surprised that you’re here,” MicroStrategy executive chairman Saylor told Markets with Madison in Washington DC. “The people that really need it [Bitcoin] are the global investors that are not in the major cities. “Because you can buy into the most scarce, desirable, global, digital property, and you’re getting the same investment proposition as a New York billionaire. “[New Zealanders] need it more. Trust fund babies in Manhattan don’t need it, they’ve got a lot of other [investment] options.” Saylor said investors like himself – who personally owned at least US$1.1 billion ($1.8b) worth of the crypto currency – were actively attempting to drive its price higher, meaning buyers of Bitcoin would stand to benefit. His Nasdaq-listed technology company was the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, with more than 225,000 Bitcoins on its balance sheet worth more than US$16b. Saylor suggested New Zealand businesses could follow his adoption playbook and acquire Bitcoin as a Treasury asset. “If you’ve got a company that’s a low-growth company, geared to the New Zealand economy, if you start to invest your balance sheet into Bitcoin, you are now with a 1% grower in New Zealand bolted on to a 50% high-growth, Big Tech, digital monetary network. “How many companies in New Zealand grow 20% a year for 10 years in a row? The odds are just about next to none. “But what are the odds of Bitcoin going up 20% a year? That’s actually my bear case.” Saylor expected Bitcoin to reach a price of US$13 million – it was currently about US$68,000. This year, financial institutions including BlackRock launched exchange-traded funds, offering investors exposure to the crypto currency through the stock market for a low fee. He believed Bitcoin’s next big moment – more listed companies or governments adopting Bitcoin – would be driven by banks accepting it as money in accounts or as collateral for loans. “Banking is just the next logical step,” Saylor suggested. “If you want to see all the people with the money and the power in the world embrace the asset, they will do it when their vendors support the asset. That’s a rippling thing.” Some Bitcoin investors were against Saylor’s suggestion banks should become more significant custodians of the asset because it would centralise a currency popular for its decentralised nature. In the interview he defended his position, arguing it increased the safety of the asset. “I think when the Bitcoin is held by a bunch of crypto-anarchists who aren’t regulated entities who don’t acknowledge government or don’t acknowledge taxes, or don’t acknowledge reporting requirements, that increases the risk of seizure. “When you have regulated, public entities like BlackRock and Fidelity and JP Morgan and State Street bank holding the asset, well, all the lawmakers and all the law enforcement arms, they’re invested in those entities. “So, there’s no way all the senators and all the congressmen are going to seize the assets ... because that’s where all their retirement money is.” Bitcoin’s peer-to-peer network had no central power controlling it and no central point of technological failure. Speaking to the characteristics of the Bitcoin network and its invention by the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto, Saylor said it achieved scarcity and had an “immaculate conception”. “Satoshi launches it, walks away forever, disclaims beneficial ownership – it’s an immaculate conception.” The initial Bitcoin mined by Nakamoto to secure the network had not been sold, Saylor said. Bitcoin’s supply was capped at 21 million tokens, meaning it had an expected deflation rate, unlike fiat currencies issued by central banks that targeted an annual rate of inflation. While many other crypto currencies had been launched, Saylor said Bitcoin was clearly the winner. “It’s because all the smart money in the world decided that’s the winner. Did it have to be? Well, no. “It’s like, why do we speak English? Because all the rich, powerful people decided on English. Could it have been a different language? It could have been French.” Explaining why he believed Bitcoin was a superior asset, Saylor said it was “clean money”, akin to “economic steel”, compared with dirty money such as sovereign debt, which had a negative real yield after tax. “It’s like forcible chemotherapy for your healthy 14-year-old teenager,” he said of sovereign debt. “That’s the scourge, the burden of humanity that they’ve been hauling for thousands of years. “When you ask, ‘What is human progress, what elevated the civilisation?’, it’s technology.” Saylor himself was once against Bitcoin, comparing it to online gambling in a 2013 post on social media platform X (formerly Twitter). Acknowledging it, Saylor said: “Everyone’s against Bitcoin before they’re for it.” “I’m sure the first guy with fire scared a bunch of other tribesmen. No one wants to get burned. Yet without fire, we’re not better than the apes.” When asked why he bothered being so publicly bullish on Bitcoin, Saylor said he wanted to “fix the money”. “If the money is broken, all eight billion people have toxic capital. All 300 million companies have toxic capital.” Watch part one and two of Michael Saylor discussing Bitcoin and his company MicroStrategy on Markets with Madison in the videos above.

Title: Shocking statement from Musk: Artificial Intelligence has a 10-20% chance of going very badly

In a highly controversial statement, Elon Musk estimated that artificial intelligence (AI) has a 10-20% chance of developing in an extremely negative direction (for the planet). The owner of X, the automaker Tesla, and the space company SpaceX is participating as a speaker at the 8th FII conference in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. This statement carries additional weight coming from Musk, who is known for his investments in AI development and, until now, has defended its safety despite concerns about its future evolution. However, this is not the first time the billionaire entrepreneur has commented on the dangers of AI. According to Bloomberg, the conference includes executives from Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, BlackRock, and Citadel, with Musk invited via live streaming to discuss AI. “I believe that artificial intelligence poses a significant existential threat and something we need to be very cautious about,” Musk stressed. Speaking at the Future Investment Initiative in Riyadh, Musk reaffirmed predictions he made months ago, warning that AI carries the risk of “wiping out” humanity. Nonetheless, he added a more optimistic note, suggesting there is now an 80-90% chance that AI’s development could yield positive outcomes. “I think it will be capable of doing anything a human can do, possibly within the next one to two years,” Musk told the conference. He also predicted that by 2040, around 10,000 humanoid robots might be in operation.

Title: Saudi wealth fund to cut overseas investments
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/saudi-wealth-fund-to-cut-overseas-investments-3688693
Time Published: 2024-10-29T15:11:58Z

By Hadeel Al Sayegh, Iain Withers and Anousha Sakoui RIYADH/LONDON (Reuters) -Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund plans to cut its overseas investments by about a third, its governor told a conference in Riyadh on Tuesday, as the Kingdom taps into its resources to fund plans to wean the economy off oil. Speaking on a panel of business, technology and finance leaders, Public Investment Fund Governor Yasir Al-Rumayyan said the sovereign wealth fund was more focused on the domestic economy and aiming to bring the fund's international investments down to between 18% and 20% of the total from 30%. Global business, technology and financial leaders have converged on the Saudi capital for the annual Future Investment Initiative (FII) summit, an opportunity for attendees to forge relations with some of Saudi Arabia's biggest companies and its $925 billion sovereign wealth fund. This year, the event may also test investor appetite in Saudi Arabia's economic transformation at a time when there are fears of widening conflict in the Middle East. The sovereign wealth fund is the main vehicle for Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's plans to steer the Saudi economy away from oil, with investments of hundreds of billions of dollars to develop new sectors and create more sustainable revenue streams. However, the fund has been scaling back some of its flagship "giga-projects" due to rising costs. Al-Rumayyan said there had been a shift in the way the fund deploys its investments towards establishing joint ventures with both international and local companies. "Now we see a shift from people who want us to invest or take our money to invest from there to co-investments," he told the conference. The country's investment minister, Khalid-al-Falih, said on Tuesday that the number of foreign companies with regional headquarters in Saudi Arabia had reached 540, ahead of a 2030 target of 500. An example of one will be Mizuho Bank, whose CEO Masahiko Kato said: "we will establish a regional headquarter in KAFD, in Riyadh." Oil remains the mainstay of the Saudi economy and Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman told the same event that the country was committed to maintaining crude capacity at 12.3 million barrels per day. Other high-profile speakers on Tuesday included Stephane Bancel, CEO of Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) President and CIO Ruth Porat, and the CEOs of several of the biggest banks including Citi, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. Artificial intelligence, the upcoming U.S. presidential election and the economic outlook were the main topics, and there was almost no mention of wars in the region on those panels. However, economist Jeffrey Sachs of Columbia University gave a speech that was critical of the United States and Israel. "We don't need artificial intelligence in war, we need human intelligence to stop the wars," he said to applause. Sachs said Israel and the U.S. were blocking the establishment of an independent Palestinian state. "Until there is (a Palestinian state), there is going to be no peace in the region," he said speaking of wars in Gaza and Lebanon and concerns there may be a wider regional conflict. Elon Musk also joined the conference via videolink where he spoke about population decline, the need for "maximally truth seeking" artificial intelligence, and timing for sending space ships to Mars. He said he believed instead some AIs were being trained to be politically correct, with some being built with a "woke, nihilistic, in my opinion, philosophy." He estimated that by 2040, there could be billions of humanoid robots, priced between $20,000 to $25,000. That development could multiply the valuation of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), according to Musk. “Robotic taxis makes Tesla about a $5 trillion company," Musk said. "The Optimus Robot, I think, makes Tesla a $25 trillion company.” The Optimus robot is the humanoid robot under development by Tesla. U.S. ELECTION With just a week to go until America elects a new president, several panelists were asked who was more likely to win. Citadel CEO Ken Griffin said that markets expected Donald Trump to beat Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris on Nov. 5 but that the outcome remained "almost a coin toss". Blackstone (NYSE:BX) CEO Steve Schwarzman, who has endorsed Trump, initially said he wouldn't comment on the election before saying that Trump had a better understanding today of the how the presidency works than in 2016. There was also optimism about the global economy and among the bank CEOs about an increase in corporate dealmaking next year. Ted Pick, Morgan Stanley CEO, told another panel that the increase in activity would "be a global phenomenon", with bigger companies going public. Goldman boss David Solomon said he also expected more robust activity next year. Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO) CEO Marc Rowan said a Trump victory would boost merger and acquisition activity that had been dampened by the current administration and lead to investment liberalisation. Several executives also voiced concern that inflation was more embedded globally than believed, even as central banks prepare to cut interest rates further. BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) CEO Larry Fink said that the central bank policy "playbook" needed to be revisited because the transmission of higher rates to slow the economy had a greater lag as populations aged and due to changes in the housing market. "I do believe we have greater embedded inflation in the world than we've ever seen," he said.

Title: Behind the Scenes with FOX's NFL crew: How Tom Brady, team tell stories with graphics

By Richie ZyontzFOX NFL Lead Producer Editor's Note: Richie Zyontz has been an NFL producer for FOX since 1994 and is in his 23rd season as the lead producer. He has more than 40 years of experience covering the league and has produced seven Super Bowls. Throughout the 2024 NFL season, he is providing an inside look as FOX's new No. 1 NFL team, including NFL legend Tom Brady, makes its journey toward Super Bowl LIX. Read more behind-the-scenes stories from Richie Zyontz here. My first boss in sports television once described a football broadcast as consisting of three primary elements. He cited commentary from the announcers as the first category — painting a picture with words. Then came live coverage and replays — painting a picture with pictures. It was the third component that took me by surprise — painting a picture and telling a story with words and numbers plastered on the screen. [Related: More from Tom Brady | More from Richie Zyontz] It was the world of graphics, and for more than 40 years, it has been the career starting point for many successful producers, directors and executives. Once upon a time, graphics in a football game consisted of very little. Down and yardage, player names attached to rudimentary statistics, and the score only when going to commercial. By today’s standards, it was almost criminally uninformative. So, when CBS Sports began a program in 1981 to upgrade the graphics on all their events, I was fortunate to be among the first group hired. Although I’m not sure why. A love and pretty deep knowledge of sports, perhaps. But being a security guard in the CBS headquarters known as Blackrock hardly qualified me for this new adventure. The first graphics truck I worked in consisted of four people. There was the broadcast associate (me) in charge of the editorial, the technician operating the graphics machine, a statistician, and a person on a headset getting scores from other games. A cozy little group huddled in a rental trailer with three or four monitors to work with. And maybe a donut or two. Now the graphics unit numbers a dozen people, dozens of monitors, and takes up an entire truck. A broadcast graphics truck is a much busier place these days than it used to be. (Photo courtesy of Richie Zyontz) Needless to say, that third key component of a sports telecast described to me way back in 1981 has grown by leaps and bounds, changed forever when FOX entered the network picture in 1994. FOX wanted its graphics to be the industry leader, with an emphasis on making a unique visual difference to what we put on the screen. The most lasting and significant of those innovations was the Fox Box, which keeps the score on constantly and from which many other stats are triggered. Mocked at the time by other networks, it has now been copied by everyone, 30 years later. FOX LEADS THE WAY IN GRAPHICS, AND TOM BRADY IS ALL IN The explosion of graphics on your screen coincides with the explosion of information now available to us. Once upon a time, research consisted of poring through team press releases. Not anymore. We have half a dozen sources of information at our fingertips each week. Tom Brady jumps on weekly phone calls with NFL Next Gen Stats and Pro Football Focus, two outstanding sources of sophisticated data. At our first offseason meeting with Brady, he didn’t seem particularly interested in making statistics a big part of his broadcasting repertoire. That has now changed. He is clearly excited about the information available to him and enthusiastically discusses and dissects this analytic data every week. Now, certain stats have not been kind to our crew. Of the games we’ve covered, the visitors have won 7 of 8, outscoring the home team by a cumulative score of 251-154. Through 8 weeks of the NFL season, 67 games have been decided by 7 points or fewer. Our crew has only seen two of them. But there is a silver lining, especially for a new broadcaster just learning the ropes. BRADY KEEPS HIS ENERGY UP IN A BLOWOUT, WHILE SEAHAWKS FIGHT THEMSELVES Maintaining energy is crucial to anyone wearing a headset. That's easier said than done when the game proves to be less than competitive. There are Hall of Fame broadcasters who sound bored when calling bad games. As a viewer, that’s poisonous. Considering how our first eight games have played out, my money is on Brady avoiding such bad habits. On a typical rainy day in Seattle this past Sunday, we were treated to another one-sided game, as the Buffalo Bills and their electric quarterback Josh Allen dismantled the Seahawks, 31-10. The rain and wind were a huge part of the story, and played right into Tom’s wheelhouse of experience playing in bad weather. Rain and wind (and hair in his eyes) couldn't slow down Josh Allen against the Seahawks. (Photo by Steph Chambers/Getty Images) As the game got out of hand, Kevin Burkhardt and Tom had opportunities for some great anecdotal conversations. For instance, Brady took time to praise the Bills Mafia while telling a story about how that same fan base would hang him in effigy when he was with the Patriots. It was a fun story that might not have been told during a close, exciting contest. Not for a second did anyone’s energy waver. Not in our booth and not on the field, where our drenched camera people found some incredible shots. They captured Seattle teammates fighting on the field and then on the bench from multiple angles. Our cameras caught the Seahawks scuffling with each other during the game. There were also tight under the helmet shots, which have long been the signature of our fabulous camera crew. With the steady rain falling, those shots were even more dramatic. My favorite picture, courtesy of our low end zone cameraman Andy Mitchell, was an extreme closeup of a football just before the snap, wet on one half, dry on the other. Beautiful! ON TO LAMBEAU, THE NFL'S BEST GAME-DAY ENVIRONMENT So now we move on to Green Bay for an NFC battle between the Packers and the Detroit Lions. Lambeau Field is the best game-day environment in the NFL. As usual, our graphics crew will be loaded with interesting numbers. Hopefully, we get to cover a close game, but if not, there’s always a silver lining. Richie Zyontz has been an NFL producer for FOX since 1994 and is in his 23rd season as lead producer. He boasts more than 40 years of experience covering the NFL.

Title: Bitcoin Tops $71,000—A 5-Month High—As Election, Inflation Questions Swirl

Bitcoin just hit its priciest level since the spring as several market conditions, including next week’s U.S. presidential election, impact the $1.4 trillion cryptocurrency. Trump gives a keynote speech at the Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville in July. Bitcoin rose about 6% to as high as $73,544 at about 3 p.m. EDT, or 7 p.m. Greenwich Mean Time, Tuesday, the highest price for the token since March 14 (price movements in the 24/7 bitcoin market is most commonly measured in GMT). That moves bitcoin’s October gain to 13%, outstripping the leading American stock index S&P 500’s 1% advance this month. Other major digital assets rallied Tuesday, with ethereum up 4% to a 10-day high of $2.637, Binance coin up 2% to an eight-day high of $608 and Solana up 2% to a three-month high of $182. Also rallying were stocks of companies involved in bitcoin mining, the energy intensive process in which bitcoins are unlocked from the digital blockchain: Shares of Core Scientific, Marathon Digital and Riot Platforms each gained Tuesday and are up at least 15% apiece in October. The bitcoin-led crypto rally is a confluence of several factors. Investors such as hedge fund billionaire Paul Tudor Jones have called on bitcoin as a hedge against inflation as the government and presidential candidates Kamala Harris and Donald Trump support policies that economists project will add trillions of dollars to the national debt. And with the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates last month, skeptics believe monetary policy may be ill-equipped to correct inflation. Prices for the more conventional safe haven asset, gold, have also jumped, with gold up 6% since the Sept. 18 rate cut. The rise in bitcoin prices have also coincided with climbing betting market odds for a Trump victory, as the previous bitcoin skeptic Trump positions himself as the pro-bitcoin candidate, calling for a “strategic national bitcoin stockpile.” And there’s continued upward pressure from the spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds approved by U.S. regulators in January, which attracted billions of dollars of inflows from institutional investors into the digital asset, according to Bernstein research. $66 billion. That’s how much bitcoin is held by the spot bitcoin ETFs operated by legacy asset managers BlackRock and Fidelity and more digital-focused players like Grayscale, or about 5% of the global bitcoin market. Bitcoin is by far the most valuable crypto token with an aggregate market value more than four times that of the next biggest digital asset, ethereum, which in turn is more than three times larger than the third largest crypto token, Binance coin, excluding the stablecoin Tether. Bitcoin hit an all-time high of $73,750 in March, and is up more than 300% from its late 2022 nadir during the “crypto winter,” when a string of high-profile bankruptcies for one-time titans in the industry, including the exchange FTX, shook confidence.

Title: Elon Musk Fans Are Losing So Much Money to Crypto Scams

Full Content:
Elon Musk isn’t just the richest person in the world, he’s also an investor in cryptocurrency. And the fact that Musk very publicly promotes crypto means a lot of people on social media don’t find it suspicious when they see videos of the billionaire promising to make them rich with some shady crypto investment. Deepfake videos of Musk hawking crypto are incredibly common on sites like Instagram, YouTube, TikTok, Facebook, and X, leading people to lose obscene sums of money to scammers. And Gizmodo has obtained official complaints with the often shocking stories and we’re publishing them below. Gizmodo filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request with the FTC to get complaints sent to the federal agency about crypto scams that pretend to be affiliated with Musk. We obtained 247 complaints, all filed between Feb. and Oct. of this year, and they’re filled with stories of people who believed they were watching ads for authentic crypto investments sanctioned by Musk on social media. The ads sometimes featured the names of Musk’s various companies, like SpaceX, Tesla, and X, while other times they utilized Musk’s association with neo-fascist presidential candidate Donald Trump. Musk, of course, endorsed Trump over the summer and has donated over $100 million to his own super PAC to get the former president re-elected. Philadelphia district attorney Larry Krasner filed a lawsuit Monday over Musk’s attempt to buy votes with his $1 million sweepstakes, but that’s an entirely different story Some people in the complaints believed they were talking directly with Musk, a sadly common story that has popped up in news reports before. But they weren’t talking with Musk, of course. They were communicating with scammers engaging in what’s called pig butcheringâthe name for a type of fraud popularized in the mid-2010s where scammers extract as much money as possible through flattery and promises of tremendous profits if the victim just “invests” where they’re told. There’s often a romance element to pig butchering, where the scammers pretend to be interested in a romantic relationship, but that was rare in the complaints Gizmodo obtained about Musk. More often than not, the marks are simply trying to make a quick buck and are sending money into completely fraudulent systems that make the victim think their money is sitting somewhere and growing. In reality, the public-facing portal is just smoke and mirrors with a number that changes at the whims of the scam artists. How much money did people lose? It’s actually kind of shocking when you read through the FTC complaints. People report losing hundreds of thousands of dollars in a relatively short period of time. One person in Michigan who reported losing $700,000 to scammers explained they became suspicious “because I am not able to get information about the company, such as an address, email address or any other contact information except the phone number.” Another victim in Nevada who lost over $220,000 said they “saw a commercial featuring Elon Musk” that appeared “on either TikTok or Instagram” that was “asking people to join his AI trading platform.” The complaints have been redacted, striking them of any personal information, making it impossible for Gizmodo to track down the victims and verify their stories. But the sheer number of stories, and their similarities, make it worthwhile to look at even unverified claims to see what techniques scammers may be up to these days. While private information has been redacted by the FTC, there is useful information in the FOIA release that can help give context to where people are living and age ranges that help show who’s being victimized. Much like the scams we looked at on Truth Social earlier this month, most of the victims appear to be elderly. And that makes sense, if only because those people often have the most money to lose after a lifetime of saving. They’re also likely to have more access to their retirement accounts, though there is a complaint from one person in their 50s who lost over half a million dollars by draining their 401K, presumably prematurely. “This continued to happen until I depleted all my 401k that I had worked for 28 years to earn, leaving me with no nothing,” the complaint from North Carolina reads. “They continue to harass me asking me for more money saying that they have a plan to gain my money back.” There’s also the person in their 30s from Nevada who reported losing $32,000 while trying to find a YouTube video of Donald Trump doing a Fox News town hall. “I saw a video on YouTube supposedly about the Trump Town Hall with Hannity and this video of Elon Musk appeared talking about a crypto giveaway. Apparently it is a scam,” the complaint reads. The majority of the victims are from the U.S., and it’s natural that Americans would file complaints in their own country. But some of the complaints are from other parts of the world, including Canada and India. The thing they all have in common? The victims thought whatever they were investing in had Elon Musk’s seal of approval. Many of the scam website URLs have been redacted, but there are a handful that were still listed in the documents obtained by Gizmodo. One such website had been seized by the Kings County District Attorney in New York, according to the landing page, which we’ve captured below. Others were deleted entirely, but some, like elondonald.com, were still live at the time of this writing. Gizmodo is publishing some of the complaints below. Spelling and grammatical errors have been retained from the original. If you’ve been scammed on the internet and want to share your story you can email [email protected] In the end of June, 2023 I responded to Elon Musk’s day trading commercial on Instagram. I got a phone call from a person and started online trading with XT-BestSolutions. I’m dealing with one person [redacted] over the Viber phone services. He said he’s based in Barcelona, Spain. He guided me through the trading process daily on the XT-BestSolutions trading platform. He also guided me through the process of transferring my money from my US Huntington bank accountÂ through Crypto wallets to XT-BestSolutions trading platform. All transaction were made through different Sources to change US dollars to cryptocurrency. Starting on June 30, 2023 to current date, I transferred $700,000 to my XT-BestSolutions account. Through the process of online trading, XT-BestSolutions company credited me $200,000. Even though I still have more than $700,000 in my XT-BestSolutions trading platform account,Â I cannot withdraw any money back until I add $200,000 more to my XT-BestSolutions account to cover this additional credit, and after this (accordingly to what he saying) I will be able to withdraw all $900,000. Its become more suspicious to me because I am not able to get information about the company, such as an address, email address or any other contact information except the phone number and one person I communicating with. [redacted] My accountant has advised me to contact the FBI before I make anymore money transactions. [Redacted] was a victim of a crypto-currency investment scam by two scammers who identified themselves as [redacted] and Prof [redacted] in a WhatsApp chat group. He was instructed to download the WhatsApp after he click a link on Facebook that claimed to be Elon Musk looking forÂ people to invested in his AI business. The scammers instructed Henry to go on CSTT.co the online trading app and to udoBIT.com to complete several wire transfers. CSTT customer service and [redacted] instructed Henry to wire money to the Crypto.com and Cathay Bank. [redacted] completed 13 wire transfers that totaled to $618,000. Wire Transfers started on 11/29/23 through 01/03/24. [redacted] used the phone number [redacted] and Prof [redacted] used number [redacted]. I was online and saw the opportunity to invest in crypto funds, using AI algorithms and swing trading sponsored by Elon Musk in an effort to earn a few $100 a day.Â I was introduced to the Professor [redacted] and his assistant [redacted] who would be helping me in this.Â Originally, they furnished a trading account on the SILDGROUP platform with $100 to learn how to trade crypto currency with their guidance and instructions. Professor [redacted] was in charge of sending the trade signals and Assistant Sofia would explain how to trade and provide technical details. If I wanted to make more money, I was told I needed to have more in my account. I was encouraged to add more money if I wanted to reap higher profits, and in doing so I was earning more and more into my contract trading account.Â There were discussion group scenarios and we would meet at 4pm and 7pm EST each day to discuss financial scenarios going on in the US as well as in the crypto currency markets that would ultimately effect pricing. There were times of every few weeks that I would make a mistake and trade on the wrong coin, losing all the money that I had put in.Â I was given the impression that if I added money, they would help me make up what I had lost and gain more and more. This continued to happen until I depleted all my 401k that I had worked for 28 years to earn, leaving me with no nothing. They continue to harass me asking me for more money saying that they have a plan to gain my money back. We were scammed out of 233K over 4 months (From March 2024 to June 20, 2024) by organized criminal with online trading company called ICHCOIN.info leaded by: To trap investor with Elon Musk’s announcement of Quantum AI 4.0 on Facebook. Once clicked, new investor was invited to a WhatsApp school EIF Business School – Class session happened on every weekday, to teach about contract trading of crypto currency. Each student was credited $500 to trade with Quantum AI 4.0 signal when to trade and when to take profit. [redacted] and [redacted] acted as the Stock and Crypto analysis. [redacted] acted as the administrator and the Merchant acted as the customer service to match when there is wiring request from investors. They created different VIP groups to attract investors to wire money to join these VIP groups in order to get bigger benefit on each trading. They created fake crypto currency GMC, QPT and then MDV to lure investors. They force investors to borrow money from their school to buy crypto at Initial Coin Offer. when the investors sold those coins, they request to pay back that borrowed money in order to withdraw money. One I wired the money in, they won’t response to our requests and their website is no longer active. I saw a commercial featuring Elon Musk on either TikTok or Instagram asking people to join his AI trading platform. when I clicked on it I was added to a BlackRock AI smart contract trading ~79 WhatsApp group with over 200 members. I ignored it.Â I was then contacted about a week later via WhatsApp by a Lady with an accent named [redacted] at [redacted]: and she asked me to sign up atÂ https:www.globalcoinnexus.co So I started observing the text messages and one of the messages she sent was this : Warm reminder: Mr. Elon Musk has invited many professional analysts and trading experts from all over the world to participate in the Global Cryptocurrency Artificial Intelligence Trading Competition scheduled to be held in December. Steven Lee will represent BlackRocks London office in the Global Cryptocurrency Artificial Intelligence Trading Competition hosted by Elon Musk, and he needs more support and votes. Therefore, we invite you to join this discussion group, where we hope you can learn how to make money and receive your support and vote. 10/14/23, 9:33AM [redacted]: Here, Steven Lee will bring you the latest market money-making information. Findings from our financial research team are shared daily. These research results include: 1 The scope of Fed policy. How to invest in cryptocurrencies, forex, options, stocks and all financial markets amid the banking crisis and inflation 2 Which excellent companies and trading markets are worthy of our investment? Is short-term or long-term investment a better option? Whether you are a beginner ready to invest or a long-term investment friend, how to use the correct method to trade. How to achieve long-term and stable investment returns? Rest assured, as long as you stay here every day and carefully read the content shared in the discussion group, your wealth will definitely increase tremendously On 10/22/2023, I started with an initial capital of 0.03493077 BTC which was about 1061 USDT, and started trading. A couple of days later, Steven Lee introduced a special trading group called VIP Trading Group. The VIP trading group requires a min of 30,000 usdt. Gloria kept pushing me to invest more money to join. I tried and lost all my money. He introduced another Advanced VIP which required min 50,000 usdt. I tried that also and lost money. I kept adding more usdt just to recoup my losses.Â In all, I cashed out all my stock investments, and crypto, borrowed money, and took loans on my home trying to recoup my losses. I was finally able to recoup my money but when I tried to withdraw the money. They will not let me. The website is saying to wait for verification. I have contacted Gloria and Steven Lee but nobody will pickup or reply to my text messages. The tech support ignores me. I converted all the usdt back to BTC but can’t withdraw it. I need help in getting my money back to pay my creditors. I stumbled into this Crypto Futures Trading Group I April, 2024. There was an ad on Facebook, purportedly funded by Elon Musk guaranteeing to pay crypto investors $100K if they try his trading training program and are not a millionaire within 6 months. I clicked the link which ended up assigning me to a trading group named after Professor Keller. I was very wary at first but everything seemed legitimate and maybe it was. The team was very professional, Prof Keller provide two lectures daily, about 2 hours each. The trading logic seemed valid. In the beginning, [redacted], the Assistant, required me to join the trading platform, LFEX which she said was licensed to operate in Montana, where I live. The real reason was that LFEX was the platform they made all group members join, supposedly so everyone was using the same Exchange, fees and currencies would be the same, etc. Only one group trade that I participated in, led by [redacted] or [redacted], failed to earn profits. On average, trades by [redacted] earned 35 to 45, sometimes over 100. Trades by Prof K averaged maybe 60, with trades over 100 and 200 common.Â Prof K kept saying he was not 100 accurate in his trades. As training and trading progressed, whale activities in the marketplace increased. I personally was zeroed or almost zeroed by whales many times while practicing my trading. Other group members were having similar problems. Over time, the group wanted to know how to protect against whales. Prof K devised a Joint Trading Plan for us, incorporating students from his other trading groups so that essentially l, we became a special whale, each with their own account, instead of asking us to send him money so he could trade for all of us. Prof K said that once the Joint Trading Plan started which was this week, that he could 100 guarantee that we would earn massive profits trading in lower priced currencies between $100 to $500. This week, the plan officially launched. I think it was on Tuesday or Wed. when instead of 1 trade per day, Prof K decided to do 3 trades in the same day, all in the NAF currency. I myself has about $215K in my trading account at the time. By the time trading ended, because I had taken on extra risk in tradingÂ risked and maximized Open and Close times, I had in total, earned over 1,200 interest on my trades, ending up with an account total of ov $8.5M in my trading account. Apparently, some disgruntled member of the day trading group who was not included in our night trading because they did not meet the minimum funds requirement of $50K, reported our group to LFEX. Initially when LFEX froze my funds, they said I had broken trading laws as well as participated in activities to create market disruptions and control one or more currencies. They did not cite specifically what laws or Exchange rules I had broken. Later, I looked up their TermsÂ Conditions and determined I had not broken any trading laws. The market disruption rule was vaguely listed and there is no list of penalty fees or actions that will be taken if infractions occur. I notified LFEX that everything U had done as a trader in training was I believed, legal and within trading norms for the marketplace. I asked them to release my funds. They said I must first pay a 3 penalty fee using funds that are not in my trading account within 15 days or they will confiscate all of the money in my trading account. That seemed like extortion to me, since I really did nothing wrong. Butchered Fat Pigs Scam. While Attempting to research the juniper tesla model y that is due to be released In twenty twenty five. A live recording of Elon Musk at the annual crypto convention in nashville in front of an audience was stating that crypto currency in the way of the future. And that’s tesla uses this innovation within their company. They said that they had live help and websites. All you had to do was scan the q.R.Code on the screen And it would take you to the official website. Where then if you transferred euthereum doge orbitcoin, whatever you sent within ten minutes, you would have doubled back. Now, i’m an intelligent woman, at least I consider myself that to be. I am a huge fan of elon musk and tesla. I only bit into this because it did sound too good to be true. Because it was elon mask, and he was on stage and it was live, and it looked like him and it sounded like him and all his words promoting this technology was so believable and everything that I believe in. However, after I transferred my Bitcoin, which it fluctuates from day to day, but say, maybe around 80,000 sometimes it’s a 100, you know, a 100,000 it fluctuates, I realized I was being scammed and I sent my money from my wallet. I don’t know who I mean, obviously I have an address and II screenshot it the whole thing, and I have the. Re. The YouTube video, which I realized for days they were posting live. I reported over 25 videos to YouTube to shut them down and they just kept popping up. I wanna Sue YouTube. A $100,000 is a lot of money or 80000 or whatever it was at that time, one point something of Bitcoin. And I know, I’ll probably never get my money back, but I need to get this message out there that AI believe it was AI because it looked and sounded just like and it was in front of a live audience, and now I’m thinking the audience was fake, I do. I did record the video and I do have like the wallet that I sent it to the timing. I was screenshotting everything. But if someone can get back to me, I went to the state police, they took my I’ve complained, but I’ve never heard from anyone they said an investigator would reach out to me that didn’t happen. I also filed a complaint with the federal bureau. Cybercrime, haven’t heard from them either. Please someone reach out to me click on a link from Facebook that had Elon Musk introducing his new AI system for crypto investments. The link took me to 2 groups on WHATSAPP. The group was named Howard Mars Investment Group. This group introduced me to AKBCOIN fake Platform. I ended up setting up my Crypto.com account and wired money from my personal account. I then transferred tether to the fake site. The site manipulated transactions to seem as if I was trading but actually was not. I ended up transferring $80k to the site and once the site showed I made funds it wouldn’t allow the withdrawal. Then the customer service said I had to pay a take on my winnings in order to retrieve my funds. Once I sent them the funds, they still did not release the funds from the site. The group disbanded and so did the site. www.h5.akbcoin. com I watched an ad on Facebook from Elon musk. That should have been my first red flag They offered u money to learn how to trade and invest in crypto currencies Log in ctall trading platform create an account and start learning.Â So I did.Â I spoke to Caroline thru WhatsApp and in telegram.

East German. They are running an elaborate crypto trading scam, using a fake trading site disguised as CTALL platform. CTALL has an ip address listed as China. They lure you in with a fake video featuring Elon Musk. Caroline convinces you to join and wire money to your trading account. Professor Andrea publishes his daily bullshit about the crypto market and elementary trading tips for review. He then provides fake trading signals for members to follow. The trades are not real so he can make them show high profits to keep you excited. All this time, they are relentless about telling you to increase your account funds for more profits. After you have deposited a few thousand dollars cash into your trading account, they manipulate the leverage on your order to 200. Within seconds, your entire account is wiped out. They steal your money, but then pressure you to wire additional funds, saying you can make up your losses! More lies. Be careful not to get involved with these criminals. Once your money is gone it is highly unlikely you’ll get any of it back That is what I found on line It really sucks to find out you have been scammed They have a group on WhatsApp I was crypto-scammed by a phishing scammer. I went to a website where Elon Musk was talking about the coming age of cryptocurrency. It all seemed super real. Elon said he was offering a promotion. Whatever a person sent in, he would match in return. Just to help cryptocurrency establish sooner. It looked like a great opportunity, so I sent a Bitcoin. I realize now it was foolish to do so. I know now I had been conned and played emotionally. Never again. So they got my life savings. They got me for $57,000. I can’t believe it. I think many, many others were victims also of the same scam. On 8/12/24 Monday evening I was looking for the Elon Musk – Donald Trump Interview. I was brought to the phishing website trumplive.org. There, Elon Musk was discussing Cryptocurrency and the financial world to come. Truth is, it was very inspiring and well done. Then Elon offered to speed along Crypto by offering on any crypto contributed he would personally match the amount. I realize now this was a scam. I also realize now this was an AI generated Elon Musk. Caught up in the moment I seized the opportunity and sent them my .966 Bitcoin. What scams do is to sell people false-hope. Then they take advantage of you. He claimed to be the real Elon Musk. I shared personal info and financial information with him. He wanted to connect with his fans and carry them along in his career. He helped me invest in cryptocurrency to improve my financial situation.Â From his instagram profile, [redacted], where he contacted me, we then chatted on telegram, username [redacted], and most recently using the WhatsApp [redacted]. He had me purchase bitcoin through apps like cashapp, Binance, Cex.io and through a bitcoin atm. They were all sent to the company wallet id. He did trades to increase my profits. Any time I doubted him he reassured me everything was fine and he even sent me his drivers license. Any pics like that he shared would disappear after I viewed them so I was not able to save or screenshot them. I have screenshots of our conversations. When I wanted to make withdrawals from my investment account with him he required more money for different fees. This has gone on for months. He had me sign a document to be on the Tesla board, and I have a pdf of that document. He deposited a fraudulent check for 9,000 into my bank account using a previous check I had received for some work I did with horses. I have lost over 50,000 with this individual and am concerned for my safety. I am still in touch with him and he does not know I am reporting this fraud. I have been scammed by another crypto individual online involving ethereum and lost over 30,000. Elon wanted to help me recoup from that as well as that case overlapped timeframes with this one. I invested in a Scam that Elon Musk started by buying crypto currency, by 1st buying it for 300$, but before you know it I had invested 39,000$ American dollars. My 1st investment was with Delta Stock.ai. We were in close contact for a month. I had a chance to buy ( HFTs) high financial trades.the 3rd pick that they had blinking, I lost 28,000$ and the broker I had told me and my Wife that we had to come up with another,8000$ or we would lose all our investment. He blamed me for the decision that I made but he had the stock blinking and so I picked that stock. I was just wondering if there was anything that you could Help me with. Thank you for your time, please send me back an email when we can talk. Thank you I saw a video on Youtube supposedly about the Trump Town Hall with Hannity and this video of Elon Musk appeared talking about a crypto giveaway. Apparently it is a scam. trumpelon.io I sent over $30K. I am reporting this for my grandmother [redacted]. She is 77yrs old. She got on tiktok, met some person claiming to be Elon musk, convincedÂ her to start doing cryptoÂ to get some type of wallet. After that multiple people started scamming her. From tik tok, wassup app, eBay Cash app ect. She has loaded gift cards vanilla, apple, eBay. Sent money through cash app. She has gotten her socially security number stolen it’s all over the internet. She has gotten her social security check stolen. I really need help to stop these people from stealing her money she thinks all of this is real and it’s not. Please help my grandma,Â ban her from social media if you can. All her information for her scams are on her phone. Started with an ad on Instagram about investment learning that led me to join a WhatsApp group. A guru named [redacted] Vyas was guiding along with help his best student (b)(6) and assistant [redacted]). [redacted] usually provided daily inputs on stock market while [redacted] used to train people interested in Crypto and both also provided trading signals which were remarkably accurate. I only observed the guidance and signals for several weeks and realised that while stocks guidance was great the crypto profits were amazing. People were making 50 or 100 percent profits or more with each trade. I had no idea about crypto so I was initially wary of it but eventually got drawn to it. The group also eventually transformed to a crypto focussed group as more people felt the same way. This is where number of new people opened accounts in a trading app called CGL BMG on the insistence of [redacted]. [redacted] also provided information indicating how CGL BMG is reliable as it has an MSB License etc. All of this looked like a scam but a small deposit of around 200 dollars initially would limit the risk. I further went on to try withdrawal which seemed too slow but worked the first time. This brought in more trust towards the platform and my profits kept growing with some initial hiccups and increasing investment. This is also where it was understood within the group that [redacted] who is quite knowledgeable in investing and has such great accuracy using an AI based trading is actually doing some research and has partnerships with organisation’s like Elon Musk’s xAI. Of course not verified by me. This is also why crypto trading strategies kept changing each week and required higher investment for each new trading experiment. The last experiment called the Whale plan hadÂ several investment groups based on the amount of funds in USDT based on a minimum of 20k, 80k, 150k and so on. Higher profits for the higher investment slabs. I was at about 38k with my investment and profits and Aditi asked me to fund it up to 50k after which she would help me trade up to 80k so I could enjoy more profits. Now this was already difficult for me to go upto 50k as these are huge funds for me but I did and she helped me go up to a whopping 129k with a few trades. However now she suggested I add the remaining to go upto the 150k investment group instead of the 80k group. This made me strongly suspicious again and despite declining she insisted I should find a way to get there. I instead attempted to make a withdrawal of 4k, from my current total fundsÂ which are over 125k, to my Binance wallet where I had withdrawn before,but after 4 days past the withdrawal was failed. The reason was after lot of inquiry given as an anomaly in my withdrawal address which resulted in blocking the withdrawal function on my account. I was told to deposit 30 of the total funds in my account around USD 38051 to unfreeze the withdrawal mechanism. It is quite impossible for me to do this and I am now sure this is nothing but an attempt to squeeze more money out. I am helpless after investing most of my savings into this scam. Please help. I was watching a SpaceX rocket launch on YouTube with a friend.Â Elon Musk came out on the stage and began speaking to a crowd of people and said something to the effect of to celebrate today’s historic launch and to encourage the growth of crypto adoption, scan this QR code and send BTC or ETH or USDT (perhaps others but I don’t recall) to the wallet.Â We will reimburse you 2:1 any amount you send. Without checking to see if this was a scam I logged into my Kraken wallet and sent 6.5 ETH to the address.Â Almost instantaneously I realized this was fraud but could not stop the transaction. I listened to prominent individuals’ advice ( Justin Trudeau, Elon Musk etc) on line about investing in crypto currencies and I decided to invest. I was told by Maria Diaz, (who claimed that she was assigned as my accounts manager, after I refused to invest initially), that I would have a weekly income from my investment. I was given an account on line where where I was allowed to track my investment. The returns were exceptionally good, so after a while I decided that I should start retrieving income. I was then told by the aforementioned Maria Diaz that I could not. When I reminded her about our conversation about the weekly income she cut me off and closed the page on the internet. I have since been unable to get to them, as they don’t answer the phone. They have subsequently been calling me ( his name is [redacted]) from Taura Capital to help me get back my investment, but I have to send them more money to pay some fees to the person at their Accounts Dept. to do the job. I am still getting these phone calls coming in almost everyday. I clicked on an Instagram ad featuring Elon Musk discussing AI in crypto options trading. Shortly after, I was contacted by an [redacted] who introduced me to Professor [redacted] via WhatsApp. Since then, I obtained what appears to be a fake New York State driver’s license for Parker, listing the address as 143 West 57th Street, which is actually the Park Hyatt New York at 153 West 57th Street, New York, NY 10019. I deposited funds to a crypto address [redacted], which later changed to [redacted], and I suspect it will continue to change. When I tried to transfer the money back, [redacted] stopped this, claiming the only way to retrieve my funds was by joining a VIP group with a minimum investment of $50,000. I refused to do this, so I traded in the account and grew the funds to USDT 115,415.82. However, when I attempted to transfer the funds out, I was blocked again and told I couldn’t access the profits without making the additional investment, confirming my suspicions. These people need to be stopped to prevent more individuals from being scammed in the future. Here is the last part of today’s conversation 7/3/24, 18:19:51 [redacted]: You have till FridayÂ to do so then its FBI time 7/3/24, 18:21:28 [redacted]: This is my rule. I am not afraid of the FBI. You cannot withdraw funds because you have not met the conditions. So this is your own problem and has nothing to do with me. 7/3/24, 18:21:50 [redacted]: I will report everything to the FBI. 7/3/24, 18:22:44 [redacted]: Yes show me where you conveyed those conditionsÂ your not a smart as you think 7/3/24, 18:23:06 [redacted]: We will get to you in the end 7/3/24, 18:23:47 [redacted]: Therefore, the FBI will put the blame on you, saying that it is your own fault that you cannot withdraw your money. 7/3/24, 18:24:37 [redacted]: Legally you don’t have a foot you never gave the terms and conditions in writing 7/3/24, 18:24:37 [redacted]): Remember, it’s your own fault. 7/3/24, 18:25:05 [redacted]: No, you’re a fraudster 7/3/24, 18:25:23 [redacted]: OK, from now on you will no longer be able to learn and trade in my group 7/3/24, 18:25:46 [redacted]: Olivia is about to remove you from the group 7/3/24, 18:26:14 [redacted]: good your digging a deeper hole for yourself 7/3/24, 18:26:46 [redacted]: You need to add funds again before you can withdraw 7/3/24, 18:27:20 [redacted]): The tokens you trade don’t exist anywhere else and it’s impossible to trade them else where your bitcoin doesn’tÂ match the market ticker all bullshit 7/3/24, 18:27:47 [redacted]: I did not force anyone to invest or trade. Everyone&#39;s investment and trading was voluntary. 7/324, 18:28:43 [redacted]: [redacted] has removed you 7/3/24, 18:28:56 [redacted]: If i add1 Dollar ill never see it again if you are an honest person and prove to me that i can trusty you, you would let me withdraw to show good faith then I would trust you, but I can’t all you are doing is holding me to ransom 7/3/24, 18:29:30 [redacted]: I’ll say it one last time, you must add funds again to make a withdrawal 7/3/24, 18:29:48 [redacted]: Before that, don’t contact me. 7/3/24, 18:30:25 [redacted]: that’s fine it makes no difference i can’t get to the money anyway My one last time return my money and all the data will be handed over Friday I was reached out to as Elon Musk CEO on IG and later on Whats app! later on on Telegram channel under Elon Reev Musk He told me about the platform: www. starlinkmining.com His Bit CoinÂ Mining platform! I waited for 2 weeks and then saw the real Elon Musk with woads of cash in his hands from the mining platform on my iphone! I didnt understand where it was streaming from! so I contacted the website because I thought Elon Musk has approved of it! That was the only reason!!! so I invested $18000. I meant to only invest $2000 and then cash out and see if it was possible! But their pressure sell tactics over came me! They use paypal and Zell, Venmo, try to open account on ,started cash app s andÂ connected to my Bank, down loaded all crypto wallets , and block chaines to withdraw theÂ money from ! it took 2 months all together! It took over 8 -10 hours a day to be able to withdraw money from my accounts due to security measures I had placed on my accounts! They are so smooth and sophisticated thatÂ make you open your cash app accounts in front of them and follow their instructions to withdraw money money from you accounts and send it to these unknown people the miners .Â Everytime I said I don’t to invest anymore he would say Ok! you can start withdrawingÂ anytime !Â When you sign up there are 2 sites you deal with! one is the platform and the other one is you account platform. where you get a login! and once you go in you will see the amount invested and several other boxes that show how much you have made real time,also there is a chat boxÂ that answers any needs or questions. everyone has to have an account manager who leads you in how to to invest! In my case Elon Musk!!!Â When it came to withdrawing, I was told by the accounts website chat that I need to pay $15000.00 for cash out of $170000.00! when I asked what are the charges pertaining to, they said its the IRS rulesÂ that they are collecting for the IRS! I did a search the company is a UK company ! I reported to my account manager and told him this doesn’tÂ sound right! and blocked him! another week went by and the account websiteÂ emailed me and said that the IRS fee was paid by my account manager and to call him to start cashing out! eager that I was to get my own money back I contacted him on whats app and he said ok and lets cash out! I gave filled out a form onÂ the website that seemed like a regular wire form from my bank and gave them the account number to wire the money to. everything was going great until they toldÂ me you need a pin number in order to receive the money in you bank! and for me that fee was $1500. Un willing to pay a dime I declined and blocked my manager again. Later on he tried on Instagram to reach me but I blocked him there to!Â I am reporting this to letÂ you know how sophisticated these people are.Â There are lots and lots of impersonators of Elon Musk out there specially on social media X and IG forÂ sure and for people like me the victims!Â I am 60 years old and know about technology enough to follow them and I could tell how smart they are! they truly are! on Facebook, I found an ad that supposedly Elon musk and his team created quantum AI and if you join the investment club youll make money. This AI created Elon Musk even stated that if he didnt make $1 million and six months he would give you a Tesla, so I followed the link and signed up with a company called Frank Barbara, crypto trade chamber. I watched i the trading for two or three weeks before I started sending money to my crypto wallet, and then sent from the crypto wallet to the trading platform called vencoinss.com. I sent them $10,000 to their bank account in California and started trading and they sent me the $10,000 back as I was making so-called profits. I felt confident that this was OK so I sent $17,000 in USD to the trading account. I built the account up to $64,000 with my 17,000 and the rest fake profit. Then I was about to send them more money when a trade happened that I lost $69,000 that wiped out my account and I knew it was a scam because the trade was with MSH crypto which is worth less than a dollar and I lost 69,001 trade using $6500 in funds for the trade I have documentation on WhatsApp of all my trades and the so-called administrator. My name is [redacted] and my phone number is [redacted], my email address is [redacted] , I want to see this so-called company put out a business so nobody else loses any money. Elon Musk and I have been communicating through text messaging since June 2023.Â He first got me talked into investing Apple Gift Cards in the amount of $500 each.Â His promise was to pay me half of the investment accumulating interest at Crypto Currency Account in BTHÂ ETH and a new Tesla car.Â The rest was supposed to help pay for our wedding.Â At first I thought it was an imposter.Â But latter Elon sent me voice messages, several oaths of loving me and I have talked with Elon on the phone several times.Â Just to verify it was really him.Â Before I reported anything I was in wonder whether anyone would beleive me.Â But after Elon got his Billion Dollar Package deal, his demeanor changed towards me.Â He got all my SSDI check this past June and has left me owing for my July rent and withdrew all the money on his Birthday the 28th.Â Valued at over $700,000.00.Â Without wire transfering it to my account.Â He also used my ID.me account verification access codes.Â To verify my Identity and created that Cryptocurrency account using my name.Â I have screenshots on the balancees.Â To show we conversed alot and would talk for hours about our building our money up so we would have a good future together.Â Now last I seen on Facebook…hes in Dubai with some young girl.Â And Im scared Im going to end up homeless without his helps.Â I dont know what to do about it. UPDATE 07/18/2024 Consumer is calling to report that she is receiving death threats from someone. Consumer reported that she is being stalked by his girlfriend. Consumer is referred to the local police department. I answered an ad saying that they use Elon Musk AI trading recommendations. Its run by two people [redacted] and [redacted]. Its on a what’s app chat room. I deposited first a $1,000. into the ECOS account and made some money using Patrick’s recommendations. By the way the profits were over 50 almost all of the time, that was the first red flag. So [redacted] talked me into putting another $8,000 into my account so i could join the 10X Bull Market Multiplier. So with the first deposit and second one i had $9000. and the profits of $1000 i had enough to join the 10X program. [redacted] said the 10X program would return 10 times my money. The only thing was i couldn’t take any of the profits out until the program was over on February 15th plus i had to give them 10 fee and the profits couldn’t be used to pay them. This was my second red flag. I figured the profits everyone was making was about as real as the dinosaurs on Jurassic Park. I then told [redacted] I didn’t want to be in the 10X program and she removed me. At this point i wanted my money back, so i started a withdrawal from my ECOS account on 2/8/2024 in the amount of $10,785 and haven’t received it yet. The money was sent by Crypto.com to ECOS in the crypto funds of USDT. Please see that there people who have about 800 people investing with them. I figure after they get the 10 the site will go dead and nobody’s going to get there money.. Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

Title: "Tackling Obesity": NHS & Eli Lilly Announce Mounjaro Clinical Trial in UK - The HighWire

Updated 5:19 AM EDT, Tue October 29, 2024 By Tracy Beanz & Michelle Edwards Obesity is not just an epidemic in the United States. It torments those living in Great Britain, too, where the most obese patients cost the National Health Service (NHS), one of the nation’s most praiseworthy institutions, an average of $2,416 a year. The health impact of obesity in Britain is significant—it is the second largest preventable cause of cancer and costs the NHS roughly $14 billion a year. Speaking up about the growing problem, British Member of Parliament (MP) and Health Secretary Wes Streeting recently stated that “widening waistbands” burdened the NHS. But, eureka, Streeting has found a “game-changing” solution. Without question, obesity wrecks one’s health, so what is Streeting’s scheme? Lo and behold, under Streeting’s lead, NHS has partnered with Lilly—the world’s largest pharmaceutical company—in a $360 million investment deal from the drug manufacturing giant to perform real-world trials of its star obesity jab Mounjaro on the unemployed. Streeting, who also serves as a Vice President of the Local Government Association and patron of LGBT+ Labour, pleaded his case in The Telegraph on October 14, 2024. Noting that “as a country, we’re eating more, eating less healthily, and exercising less.” A month before that, citing long waits for treatment, crumbling hospitals, mental health patients in “vermin-infested cells,” and far fewer MRI scanners than comparable countries, a recent government-commissioned report declared the 75-year-old NHS is in “critical condition.” With Britain’s new prime minister Keir Starmer insisting the NHS has reached a critical “reform or die” position, Streeting wrote in The Telegraph: “Our widening waistbands are also placing significant burden on our health service, costing the NHS £11 billion a year—even more than smoking. And it’s holding back our economy. Illness caused by obesity causes people to take an extra four sick days a year on average, while many others are forced out of work altogether. For years, governments have ducked the serious, long-term policy decisions required to tackle its debilitating effects. Fears of being labeled “nanny state” have meant nothing has been done, and the problem has only gotten worse. As with most of the issues we inherited, this Government recognises that we can only do so much. It will require working in partnership with business, civil society, and all of us as citizens to make real progress – that’s what Sir Keir Starmer’s mission-driven Government is about.” What is the “mission-driven” Government described by newly anointed British Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, the leader of the democratic socialist’s Labour Party? And what does “reform or die” ultimately look like? In mid-October, in what is surely a deep-state dream come true, Starmer teamed up with King Charles, Elton John, and a Michelin chef to “woo” the world’s most powerful bosses—the CEOs of Goldman Sachs and BlackRock, along with the heads of Lloyds, HSBC, Barclays and Brookfield—to secure roughly $82 billion in foreign investment pledges. Prior to Starmer’s star-studded evening, in September, The Telegraph wrote that Starmer was preparing a raft of “nanny state” interventions on public health as he “races to save the NHS from collapse.” Indeed, the UK’s healthcare system, which provides universal health coverage to UK residents and non-residents with a European Health Insurance Card, faces numerous challenges. Funded by general taxation, the NHS is typically known for providing a high standard of care, yet it is currently “flashing red” on nearly all performance measures. Hmm, it seems like the millions from Lilly, along with the billions it is seeking from the likes of BlackRock and others, will certainly help to facilitate “reform.” Dr. Phil Banfield, chairman of the council at the British Medical Association, depicts a dreadful state of affairs at the NHS, remarking that the “crisis is now and the crunch is today,” adding, “investing in medical schools while refusing to reverse years of pay erosion is illogical.” Banfield explained that the NHS is not where it is today due to the pandemic or new economic challenges precipitated by war in Europe; instead, he insists, “we’ve been warned of catastrophe for 10 years, it’s now arrived.” According to Banfield, “this devastation has been wrought by successive UK governments.” Presently, short on clinicians, the NHS has published the first ever Long Term Workforce Plan, backed by over USD 3.1 billion in Government funding to deliver “the biggest training expansion in NHS history alongside measures to improve culture, leadership, and well-being.” Apparently, controversial and dangerous weight loss jabs like Mounjaro are part of the plan to achieve well-being. “We are calling on some of the world’s leading scientific minds and research institutions to help us succeed,” Streeting proclaimed when announcing the significant investment from Lilly to shape up Britain’s healthcare predicament. He added that the five-year real-world study Lilly will operate with its weight loss jabs could be monumental in Britain’s approach to tackling obesity, which will, in turn, help people get back to work and ease the toll obesity takes on the NHS. Specifically, the study will examine the “real-world” effectiveness of tirzepatide (Mounjaro) on weight loss, and on preventing diabetes and obesity-related complications. Researchers will also measure how the drug affects a patient’s employment status and the number of sick days they take. To get Eli Lilly’s Mounjaro weight-loss program underway, the NHS, which is also “tackling obesity” with efforts like the Soft Drinks Industry Levy, has proposed that those who need it most should get it first. Britain hopes to give the jabs to 250,000 NHS patients over the next three years. Mounjaro was approved for use in the UK last year. Still, Lilly held off on its launch until its pre-filled injection device called Kwikpen was endorsed by the country’s Medicines & Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). The product has been cleared for both type 2 diabetes and obesity patients. In yet another example of Big Pharma profiting from the destruction of public health, Lilly reported worldwide sales of Mounjaro, approved by the FDA in 2022, at $5.2 billion in 2023. Analysts project its sales will rise sharply through the rest of the decade, with sales expected to reach a staggering $34 billion by 2029. But common sense must prevail. Big Pharma isn’t the solution to fix any healthcare crisis and quite literally has no desire to be. Unsafe weight loss jabs like Mounjaro must not become the overarching anecdote to the obesity crisis that has taken hold of both Britain and the United States. Having said that, it will be interesting to see how this move, which feels eerily similar to a social credit score, plays out in Britain. Noting that the “eligible population” for the Lilly obesity study is actually in the millions, Dr. Dolly van Tulleken, obesity policy specialist at the University of Cambridge, remarked: “[There are] some serious ethical, financial and efficacy considerations with such an approach … Such as looking at people, or measuring people based on their potential economic value, rather than primarily based on their needs and their health needs. It’s incredibly important that people in the UK access healthcare based on their health need rather than their potential economic value.” Tracy Beanz is an investigative journalist with a focus on corruption.

Title: These 3 Energy Closed-End Funds Are Still On Sale

Oil pumps and graph If you’re as bullish on oil as I am, let’s look past vanilla bean favorites like Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX). Great companies but a bit pricey, as they only yield 3% to 4%. We’re better off with diversified energy funds that dish dividends up to 9%. Now we’re talking! The conditions are right for another push ahead in energy’s crash-‘n’-rally cycle. The Middle East (‘nuff said). The Federal Reserve careening towards a “no landing” scenario. And the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) joining the global money printing party. It could be high time for Texas tea’s next leg higher. To celebrate, let’s review three closed-end funds (CEFs) that yield 7% to 9% and trade at discounts up to 11%. The BlackRock Energy & Resources Trust (BGR) owns energy equities—integrated energy majors, exploration and production (E&P) firms, distribution companies and more. It’s diversified from a geographic standpoint; 70% of the fund is invested in American firms such as Exxon Mobil (XOM) and ConocoPhillips (COP), while the remaining 30% is dedicated to international energy stocks including the U.K.’s Shell (SHEL) and France’s TotalEnergies (TTE). The tight portfolio of fewer than 30 holdings isn’t surprising for an actively managed fund, but BGR is really top-heavy, with Exxon accounting for more than 20% of assets (yikes!) and Shell another 10% or so. Also, while many CEFs are happy to use debt to crank up their exposure, BGR doesn’t use a cent of leverage. But this BlackRock fund does have a few familiar CEF traits. It pays monthly distributions, which we won’t find in basic sector ETFs. It also trades at a nice 11% discount to its net asset value (NAV), which is a slightly deeper bargain than its ~10% five-year average discount. Most importantly, BGR trades options. Specifically, management uses a covered call strategy, which is how it manages to squeeze a 7% yield out of the same companies that fund the Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF’s (XLE) 3%-plus yield without debt leverage. Is it a better way to invest in energy? BGR’s primary quality is guarding against downside (thanks to the covered calls), but even then, it hasn’t delivered much protection during really precipitous drops. In the meantime, we enjoy oh so much less of the upside. Adams Natural Resources Fund (PEO) is another largely straightforward energy-sector CEF, though it’s far more established. This fund came to life in 1929, meaning it’s all of about five years away from celebrating its centennial. It also has a storied distribution history, paying its shareholders for more than 80 years (and yielding 9.1% today!). PEO has a wider portfolio than BGR, at just less than 60 holdings, and it’s chock full of energy blue chips such as Exxon, Chevron, Schlumberger (SLB) and Marathon Petroleum (MPC). Oddly, though, it also has substantial (14%) exposure to chemicals firms like Linde (LIN), and a peppering of other industries, such as metals, mining, containers/packaging and construction materials. But it’s arguably more buttoned up than the BlackRock fund. It does utilize leverage, but a trace amount of it (sub-1%). Nor does it trade options. The result is nothing to scream about, but PEO does offer occasional bursts of outperformance. PEO Outperforms, Sometimes The 11% discount to NAV is a little misleading, too. We’re buying its assets on sale, sure, but we can do better—PEO’s average discount over the past five years is above 14%. Of course, most of us know if we really want income out of the energy space, we need to forget plain-Jane integrated majors and E&P firms, and instead look toward the infrastructure providers. Specifically, master limited partnerships (MLPs). The bulk of CEFs investing in the energy space are concentrated in MLPs. Among the most interesting is ClearBridge Energy Midstream Opportunity Fund (EMO), which is happy to own midstream firms (read: pipelines, storage, terminals, etc.) in partnership and corporation form. But its portfolio is thick in MLPs, including top 10 holdings such as Energy Transfer LP (ET), MPLX LP (MPLX) and Enterprise Products Partners LP (EPD). EMO gives us plenty to digest here. The fund does what CEFs tend to do—despite a modest 6% in leverage, EMO acts like a more exaggerated version of an index fund, booming when basic MLP ETFs are up, and languishing when they’re down. As a result of its run since 2020, EMO isn’t all that cheap. Yes, its assets are trading at 90 cents on the dollar. But we can do better—it has traded at an average discount of 16% over the past five years, including a stint near that average earlier in 2024. It’s also more than meets the eye. EMO actually merged with two funds—ClearBridge MLP and Midstream Fund, and ClearBridge MLP and Midstream Total Return Fund—in early September, and a couple weeks later, the company announced that Chris Eades would step down from the portfolio management team effective as of the end of 2024. And snuck into the middle of all that? An upgrade to monthly dividends. Want an example of just how disrespected CEFs are? If we go to just about any data provider, they’ll tell us that EMO yields around 3% right now. But it doesn’t! More than a month removed from a change to the fund’s dividend policy, and they’re still calculating the new 33-cent payout on a quarterly basis (3%) rather than monthly (9%). The monthly dividend is certainly more aligned with investors’ interest, but we have to be careful here. Even plain-vanilla index funds like the InfraCap MLP ETF (AMZA) deal with dividend declines; unlike traditional companies that will maintain a specific dividend level, MLPs’ distributions tend to shift with their profits. With EMO, that dynamic is exaggerated, leaving us with larger fluctuations in payouts over time. Brett Owens is Chief Investment Strategist for Contrarian Outlook.

Title: Miami’s Tech-Leasing Boom Peaks as Projects Stall and Companies Balk

© 2024 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy The 8,300-square-foot office in Miami Beach marked Andreessen Horowitz’s latest bet. Long one of the biggest players in Silicon Valley, the venture capital firm had signed a lease at Starwood Capital Group’s swanky headquarters building in 2022. The deal showed Andreessen Horowitz’s commitment to remake the Miami region into a leading tech hub. But less than two years later, the firm, which made a name for itself with early investments in Facebook, Instagram and Airbnb, took an L on its South Florida bet. It abruptly closed the office — cutting short its lease by three years — while expanding its base on the West Coast. As the pandemic has wound down, so has the Miami region’s bid to become the next Silicon Valley, at least for now. Interest in cryptocurrency, which local leaders touted, particularly in Miami proper, has cratered. Venture capital investments in Miami have plunged. Tech leasing is down, with developers failing to land anchor tech tenants to launch new office buildings. All the while, San Francisco, despite the grumbles of top tech executives over its liberal politics and crime rate, has managed to stay on top, thanks to the emergence of the artificial intelligence industry. “Let’s just be frank about it: We were mixing the Kool-Aid without the capital,” said Miami-based venture capitalist Jeff Ransdell. “It’s like having a Ferrari in your garage with no gas.” In the beginning, though, there was no shortage of excitement. Fed up with Bay Area liberals and locked up in their houses at the onset of the pandemic, conservative tech executives wanted an alternative. Miami became the answer. Unlike California, the Magic City and its host state offered unrestricted living, sunny weather and low taxes. Miami Mayor Francis Suarez turned into an overly supportive cheerleader, coaxing tech leaders to move. As they poured in, the newly minted transplants proudly extolled the city’s benefits. Bars in Miami Beach, Wynwood and Brickell hosted tech-themed happy hours nearly every night. Altogether, the hype created something of a movement and helped put Miami on the map as a budding tech hub. “That type of community and structure brought seriousness to the Miami market,” said David Seifer, a Miami-based lawyer who runs Bilzin Sumberg’s corporate practice, specializing in tech companies. Miami made great progress. Microsoft and Apple, new-to-market tech giants, signed 50,000-square-foot leases in 2021 and 2024, respectively. Wynwood, a mural-filled neighborhood, emerged as a startup destination, attracting venture capital firms Atomic and Founders Fund, the latter of which was started by billionaire Peter Thiel, a co-founder of PayPal and an early investor in Facebook. Spotify opened a 20,000-square-foot Latin American headquarters, also in Wynwood, three years ago. Amazon remains in the market. The e-commerce heavyweight is in advanced negotiations to take between 60,000 and 80,000 square feet at L&L Holding Company and Oak Row Equities’s Wynwood Plaza development, which remains under construction, according to sources familiar with the pending deal. Miami went all in on cryptocurrency, too. The city hosted the Bitcoin 2021 conference, which drew about 12,000 attendees, making it one of the first mass gatherings in the U.S. after the COVID lockdowns. FTX, the cryptocurrency exchange run by now-imprisoned Sam Bankman-Fried, won the naming rights for the city’s waterfront NBA arena as part of a $135 million deal. The City of Miami, at the behest of its mayor, created its own digital coin. But just two years into Miami’s experiment, crypto crashed (and has only mildly recovered). The meltdown dealt a stinging blow to Miami’s mission to shed its unserious, party-centric image. Interest rates were also steadily rising, which made it difficult for startups to raise capital and grow. This year, venture capital funding for Miami-based companies is on track to plummet, having recorded only $1 billion in deals during the first six months — a far cry from the $5.5 billion raised throughout 2022, according to data from Pitchbook. Office landlords that had banked on tech tenants have taken a hit, including Brick & Timber Collective. In 2022, the San Francisco-based investor purchased the Cube Wynwd, an eight-story office building in Wynwood, for $62 million, with Blockchain.com set as the anchor tenant. But the cryptocurrency tenant never moved in to its 22,000-square-foot office. Within four months of Brick & Timber’s purchase, the leasing brokers sued the landlord to receive their commission. The lender of the nearby Gateway at Wynwood office building sued the owner, R&B Realty Group this year, after it allegedly failed to pay back $102 million in debt, despite landing notable tech tenants, such as OpenStore, a startup cofounded by Keith Rabois, a prominent Silicon Valley venture capitalist who became perhaps the loudest and proudest proponent of Miami tech. Wynwood as a whole has yet to recover. While the Biscayne corridor, which includes Wynwood, boasts some of Miami-Dade County’s highest asking rents, averaging $70.79 a square foot, it also boasts one of the county’s highest vacancy rates, hovering just shy of 20 percent, according to Cushman & Wakefield (CWK)’s latest data. So far this year, tech leasing across Miami-Dade County has slowed, generating 111,661 square feet in deals — less than half the previous year, which nabbed 227,717 feet in lease agreements, per C&W. The sluggish leasing pace has slowed the office development pipeline across town. During the height of the tech frenzy, developers were quick to announce office projects. Years later, many have yet to materialize. In perhaps the most public snafu, Stephen Ross’s Related Companies partnered with Swire Properties to develop an 80-story office skyscraper in the heart of Brickell, which could have become the city’s tallest building. So far, the joint venture has failed to secure an anchor tenant or reach a 30 percent pre-lease benchmark, typical requirements for lenders before they fund construction. “Miami is not a market that routinely signs 200,000-square-foot office leases. It’s not like New York City or Chicago,” Arnaud Karsenti, managing principal of Miami-based 13th Floor Investments, said during Commercial Observer’s annual South Florida development and investment event in Miami this month. “A big lease in Miami is 40,000 square feet.” Tech companies, especially startups, don’t always have good credit ratings. Even smaller, 150,000-square-foot office projects, spearheaded by high-profile developers Goldman Properties and Dacra, have yet to break ground, despite being announced two years ago. In the meantime, San Francisco and its surrounding region are staging a tech comeback. While still struggling with a glut of empty offices, artificial intelligence has breathed new life into the area’s tech scene and office market, accounting for more than 1.7 million square feet in leasing in the city alone since 2022. To level up, Miami is missing some key elements. For one, it doesn’t have the same breadth of tech investors as the Bay Area, according to Ransdell, who founded Miami-based Fuel Venture Capital in 2016. “You can have all the ideas in the world, but without the investor fueling that, it never happens,” the venture capitalist said. The region also lacks world-class universities. The Bay Area boasts Stanford and the University of California at Berkeley, which provide a steady pipeline of new entrepreneurs and sought-after hires. Even though the number of tech-centric jobs has grown in South Florida since 2020, companies are still struggling to fill all their open positions, making them hesitant to commit to years-long office leases, according to Alexandra Poses, an urban strategist at South Florida consulting firm The Euclid Group, who has studied tech hubs. It takes time to blossom into a tech mecca. “Silicon Valley has been around for 50 years, and Miami is only just emerging as a tech hub,” Poses added. Thanks in part to its proximity to New York, Miami’s recent quest to become the Wall Street of the South has fared better. The city landed the global headquarters of Ken Griffin’s sister companies, hedge fund Citadel and market maker Citadel Securities, from Chicago. The billionaire plans to build a 54-story headquarters tower, designed by world-famous architect Norman Foster, along Brickell’s waterfront. A slew of other high-profile financial firms also expanded their presence in Miami during the pandemic, including Goldman Sachs, BlackRock, Millennium Management and Point72 Asset Management — all of which are headquartered in New York. For others, however, these rebranding efforts, whether it be tech or finance, are nothing new for Miami. “There’s always a new fad that gets people excited. They use that to sell condos and to generate investment interest for office space,” said Peter Zalewski, a condo analyst and longtime resident of South Florida. “But, at the end of the day, it always craps out. “It’s like taking two steps forward, one step back. That’s how you progress when you’re a young community that’s 125 years old.” Julia Echikson can be reached at jechikson@commercialobserver.com.

Offers advisors the convenience and simplicity of a bond ladder within an ETF NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Today, BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) announced plans to expand its iShares ® iBonds ® ETF franchise with a suite of defined maturity bond ladder ETFs. The iShares iBonds 1-5 Year Ladder ETFs aim to offer advisors the convenience and simplicity of a bond ladder within an ETF. In 2010, BlackRock pioneered defined maturity ETFs with the introduction of iBonds ETFs, helping advisors build bond ladders and efficiently manage multiple client accounts, said Karen Veraa, Head of U.S. iShares Fixed Income Strategy at BlackRock. The iShares iBonds Ladder ETFs will be a seamless extension to the iBonds franchise, seeking to provide a turnkey solution to bond laddering while making investing easier and more affordable. This approach will simultaneously offer advisors and their clients the ability to manage interest rate risk, seek higher yields, and enhance portfolio diversification. Fund Name Index Name Ticker Exchange iShares ® iBonds ® 1-5 Year Treasury Ladder ETF BlackRock iBonds ® 1-5 Year Treasury Ladder Index LDRT NYSE Arca iShares ® iBonds ® 1-5 Year TIPS Ladder ETF BlackRock iBonds ® 1-5 Year TIPS Ladder Index LDRI NYSE Arca iShares ® iBonds ® 1-5 Year Corporate Ladder ETF BlackRock iBonds ® 1-5 Year Corporate Ladder Index LDRC NYSE Arca iShares ® iBonds ® 1-5 Year High Yield and Income Ladder ETF BlackRock iBonds ® 1-5 Year High Yield and Income Ladder Index LDRH NYSE Arca The iShares iBonds 1-5 Year Ladder ETF suite will consist of four fund of funds across U.S Treasuries, investment grade, high yield, and TIPS. The ETFs will seek to track a BlackRock index that consists of an equal 20% allocation to five iShares iBonds ETFs in their respective asset classes spanning five consecutive termination years. Each index will be reconstituted and rebalanced annually by replacing the iShares iBonds ETF that terminates in the current year with one that terminates five years forward and assigning equal weights to each constituent. With over $32 billion in assets under management, the iShares iBonds ETF franchise spans several asset classes, including U.S. Treasuries, municipals, investment grade, high yield, and TIPS. Since inception, BlackRock has launched 88 iShares iBonds ETFs, with 53 still active. 1 BlackRock manages over $1 trillion in fixed income ETFs globally, up nearly 40% since 2021.2 As of October 28, 2024, the registration statements of the Funds are effective but not yet available to trade. BlackRock intends to launch the Funds before the end of year. About BlackRock BlackRock's purpose is to help more and more people experience financial well-being. As a fiduciary to investors and a leading provider of financial technology, we help millions of people build savings that serve them throughout their lives by making investing easier and more affordable. For additional information on BlackRock, please visit www.blackrock.com/corporate | Twitter: @blackrock | LinkedIn: www.linkedin.com/company/blackrock About iShares iShares unlocks opportunity across markets to meet the evolving needs of investors. With more than twenty years of experience, a global line-up of 1400+ exchange traded funds (ETFs) and $4.2 trillion in assets under management as of September 30, 2024, iShares continues to drive progress for the financial industry. iShares funds are powered by the expert portfolio and risk management of BlackRock. Carefully consider the Funds' investment objectives, risk factors, and charges and expenses before investing. This and other information can be found in the Funds' prospectuses or, if available, the summary prospectuses, which may be obtained by visiting the iShares Fund and BlackRock Fund prospectus pages. Read the prospectus carefully before investing. Investing involves risk, including possible loss of principal. The iShares iBonds ® Laddered ETFs (the Funds) are fund of funds and seek to track the investment results of a BlackRock iBonds ® 1-5 Year Ladder Index (the Underlying Index). The Underlying Indexes are composed exclusively of underlying iShares iBonds ETFs (iBonds ETFs or Underlying Funds) (as determined by BlackRock Index Service, LLC (the Index Provider) that themselves seek investment results corresponding to their own underlying indexes. Fixed income risks include interest-rate and credit risk. Typically, when interest rates rise, there is a corresponding decline in the value of debt securities. Credit risk refers to the possibility that the debt issuer will not be able to make principal and interest payments. Non-investment-grade debt securities (high-yield/junk bonds) may be subject to greater market fluctuations, risk of default or loss of income and principal than higher-rated securities. An investment in the Fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency and its return and yield will fluctuate with market conditions. TIPS can provide investors a hedge against inflation, as the inflation adjustment feature helps preserve the purchasing power of the investment. Because of this inflation adjustment feature, inflation protected bonds typically have lower yields than conventional fixed rate bonds and will likely decline in price during periods of deflation, which could result in losses. Government backing applies only to government issued securities, and does not apply to the funds. The iShares ® iBonds ® Ladder ETFs will hold 5 iBonds ETFs (the Underlying Funds), spanning 5 consecutive maturity years. The Underlying Index is reconstituted each June such that the iBonds ETF with the nearest maturity is removed from the Underlying Index and the iBonds ETF with a five-year maturity is added. If an iBonds ETF is not available for a given maturity year within the five-year range, the Underlying Index will hold fewer iBonds ETF constituents. An investment in the Fund(s) is not guaranteed, and an investor may experience losses, including near or at the reconstitution date. Unlike a direct investment in a bond that has a level coupon payment and a fixed payment at maturity, the Fund(s) will make distributions of income that vary over time. In the final months of each Underlying Funds' operation, as the bonds it holds mature, its portfolio will transition to cash and cash-like instruments. As a result, its yield will tend to move toward prevailing money market rates, and may be lower than the yields of the bonds previously held by the Underlying Fund and lower than prevailing yields in the bond market. The Funds' distributions and liquidation proceeds are not predictable at the time of investment and the Funds do not seek to return any predetermined amount. The rate of Fund distribution payments may adversely affect the tax characterization of an investor's returns from an investment in the Fund relative to a direct investment in bonds. If the amount an investor receives as liquidation proceeds upon the Fund's termination is higher or lower than the investor's cost basis, the investor may experience a gain or loss for tax purposes. Investment in a fund of funds is subject to the risks and expenses of the underlying funds. Funds that concentrate investments in specific industries, sectors, markets or asset classes may underperform or be more volatile than other industries, sectors, markets or asset classes and than the general securities market.

Title: Vatican's first annual report on child protection calls for 'rigorous approach to reparations'

We need your help now Support from readers like you keeps The Journal open. You are visiting us because we have something you value. Independent, unbiased news that tells the truth. Advertising revenue goes some way to support our mission, but this year it has not been enough. If you've seen value in our reporting, please contribute what you can, so we can continue to produce accurate and meaningful journalism. For everyone who needs it. LAST UPDATE | 29 Oct THE VATICAN HAS published its first annual report on protecting minors in the Catholic Church. Among the recommendations of the pilot annual report is the “need for a streamlined process for discharge from office when warranted”. It also calls for the Church to “study damages and compensation policies to promote a rigorous approach to reparations, as part of the Church’s commitment to the healing journey of victims and survivors”. “Compensation in the Church is not merely reduced to financial aspects,” said the report, “but embraces a much broader spectrum of actions.” These broader actions include public apologies. The report said it will “delve into the pillar of reparations in the next edition to better represent all these needs”. “Economic reparations are particularly relevant, and the Commission will continue to offer its cooperation to key Church bodies,” said the report. The pilot report also calls for the “professionalisation of safeguarding in the Church, by providing formal academic opportunities and adequate resources for aspiring safeguarding practitioners”. The Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors presented its first report this morning. Pope Francis established the Commission, consisting of an independent panel of experts, in December 2014, amid pressure for more action to tackle clerical child sex abuse. In 2022, Pope Francis asked for an annual and “reliable account on what is presently being done and what needs to change”. Francis added that he wants a “commitment to conversion away from evil and to healing the wounded”. Pope Francis during his weekly general audience in St. Peter's square at the Vatican on 23 October, 2024 The Commission was then incorporated into the Roman Curia, the government of the Holy See which assists the pope in the day-to-day exercise of his role as the leader of the Catholic Church. In April 2022, Pope Francis called for the annual reports to have a particular focus on the care of survivors of abuse. He told the Commission: “I urge you to assist in establishing suitable centres where individuals who have experienced abuse can find acceptance and an attentive hearing, and be accompanied in a process of healing and justice.” The first annual report is described as a “first step towards a process of data gathering and reporting”, and documents “where risks remain, and where advances can be found in the Church’s efforts to protect children and vulnerable adults”. The pilot report was today launched by the commission’s president, US Cardinal Sean O’Malley, the former archbishop of Boston who has spent decades listening to abuse survivors. Advertisement Cardinal O’Malley thanked the media for their presence at the press conference launching the report and said: “We know that the role you have played in forcing the Church to confront our terrible history with abuse has been very, very important.” He acknowledged that survivors are “tired of empty words” and that nothing the Church does “will ever be enough to fully repair what has happened”. “Your suffering and wounds have opened our eyes to the fact that as a Church, we have failed to care for victims, and that we didn’t defend you, and that we resisted understanding you when you needed us most,” said O’Malley. However, O’Malley said the report will help to “ensure that these events never happen again in the Church”. The annual reports will review safeguarding policies and procedures in around 20 Episcopal conferences each year and ensure there are standardised practices in place. This will include ensuring resources are in place for universal standards in safeguarding and to create centres of reporting and assistance for survivors of clerical abuse. While between 15 and 20 Episcopal conferences, representing local churches, will be reviewed each year, it’s hoped that doing so will result in the entire Church being reviewed over a period of five to six annual reports. Each annual report will also include an analysis of select religious institutes, and the pilot report included a review of the Spiritans. The annual report will also explore the Roman Curia’s role in promoting a culture of safeguarding, which is deemed to “uniquely serve as a hub for sharing good practices in safeguarding”. The Commission also aims to create a “higher degree of transparency in the Roman Curia’s procedures and jurisprudence with regard to individual cases of clerical abuse”. The Spiritans were one of the religious institutions analysed in the pilot report. It emerged in late 2022 that following an RTÉ radio documentary that 233 people had made allegations of abuse against 77 Irish Spiritans in ministries throughout Ireland and abroad. Of those, 57 people alleged they were abused on the Blackrock College campus. The leader of the Spiritans in Ireland, Father Martin Kelly, issued an apology in November 2022 to all victims on behalf of the order. The report voiced concern that in some of the more than 60 countries where the Spiritans operate, “the safeguarding officer is designated in name only and does not have any specific ordinary functions in practice”. The Commission also noted “cultural resistance to safeguarding in members’ countries of origin and in contexts where members work, some of whom see safeguarding as an imposed Western ideology”. “This resistance highlights the challenges in bringing safeguarding guidelines to life, in changing the attitudes of the members,” said the report. It also warned that the Spiritans retain “vestiges of a culture of clericalism with some members”. The Commission will engage with the Spiritans in the revision of new guidelines, set for publication this year, “with a particular focus on building a culture of safeguarding”. Since becoming pope in March 2013, Francis has taken numerous measures to tackle clerical abuse, from opening up internal Church documents to punishing high-ranking clergy, while making it compulsory to report suspicions of sexual assault to Church authorities. In 2019, Pope Francise promised an “all-out battle” against abuse, and compared child sex abuse to human sacrifice. Related Reads Irish woman who resigned from Vatican abuse panel says new report is like 'marking your own homework' But clergy are still not required to report abuse to civil authorities, unless the laws of that country require it, while any revelations made in confession remain private. Maud de Boer Buquicchio, a Dutch lawyer and former UN special rapporteur on the sexual exploitation of children who chaired the Commission’s report, said last week it would help promote a “change of mindset in the Church that embraces accountability and transparency”. During its compilation, “we have been able to explore many of the concerns about the lack of available data”, she added. File image of Maud de Boer-Buquicchio. Alamy Stock Photo Alamy Stock Photo Speaking at today’s launch, de Boer Buquicchio said the call for “accountability and justice has gone unanswered in the Church for too long”. However, she said the first annual report “engages Church membership at the highest levels in acknowledging the urgent need to better answer that call”. She added today that the reports will ensure abuse is rare and thoroughly investigated if it does occur. Members of the abuse commission are directly appointed by the pope and are experts in fields related to safeguarding, from clinical psychology to law as well as human rights. But two members representing abuse survivors resigned in 2017, one of whom was Marie Collins, who was raped by a priest in Ireland when she was 13 years old, Collins had decried as “shameful” the lack of cooperation from Vatican officials. At today’s press conference, a journalist asked Cardinal O’Malley about Collins’s resignation. 2012 file image of Marie Collins Alamy Stock Photo Alamy Stock Photo O’Malley said “Marie Collins was one of our most beloved and valuable members of the Commission” and that he was “sorry when she decided to step away”. “We understood the reasons and all of us have felt that frustration of the slowness of change coming about, but we believe that the change is taking place, even though it’s often an uphill climb.” He added: “The fact that the commission is being embedded within the Roman Curia, and given a permanent status, will be very helpful to our work.” Last year, influential German Jesuit priest Hans Zollner also quit the Commission, complaining about “structural and practical issues”. Meanwhile, O’Malley was also asked by a journalist if “there is a link between celibacy and child sexual abuse”. O’Malley said he has “never seen any serious study” pointing to such a link and that “we are satisfied that celibacy is not the cause of paedophilia”.

Title: Bitcoin hits $71K – Will Uptober, FOMO fuel a new ATH this week?

Bitcoin could form an ATH before the end of Uptober after the recent rally fueled FOMO. Bitcoin [BTC] has been trending up this month and recently reached a 20-week high above $71,500. At press time, BTC traded at $70,900 and was only 3.7% shy of its all-time highs. Several bullish indicators currently suggest that Bitcoin could form a fresh ATH before the end of “Uptober” amid positive market sentiment. A look at the Bitcoin UTXO Realized Price for short-term holders suggests that prices could continue to rise in the short term. Per CryptoQuant, the UTXO Realized Price for wallets that have held BTC for under a month is close to surpassing that of wallets that have held Bitcoin for between three to six months. Past crossovers have often preceded significant price increases. A similar crossover is about to happen, which could strengthen the bullish narrative around BTC. Source: CryptoQuant Short-term holders usually determine the sustainability of a rally. Therefore, if new transactions start occurring at higher prices, it will boost market sentiment and pave the way to an ATH. Data from IntoTheBlock shows that 98% of BTC holders are sitting in profits while 1.26% are at a break-even point. Source: IntoTheBlock When wallet profitability increases, it boosts investor confidence as holders become more willing to hold their assets rather than sell. This scenario can also stir the fear of missing out (FOMO). As a result, new buyers could enter the market, reinforcing the uptrend. FOMO is already evident as the Fear and Greed Index sits at 72. This shows that the market is in a state of greed. On 28th October, US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recorded their highest inflows in two weeks. Per SoSoValue, inflows during the day came in at $479M, with Blackrock taking the largest share with $315M inflows. Source: SoSoValue As AMBCrypto reported, BlackRock’s BTC holdings have surpassed 400,000 coins, with the asset manager being on track to flipping Satoshi and becoming the largest Bitcoin holder. Read Bitcoin’s [BTC] Price Prediction 2024–2025 US spot Bitcoin ETFs collectively hold $68.47 billion worth of assets, which is 4.9% of Bitcoin’s supply. In just two weeks, these ETFs have recorded $3 billion in netflows. As Bitcoin attracts new interest from both retail and institutional investors, its market dominance over altcoins has continued to soar. At press time, Bitcoin’s dominance stood at 60% while the altcoin season index had dropped to 27.

Fink, whose mammoth fund oversees over $10 trillion in assets, sees one rate reduction before the end of this year, compared to the two trims that other market participants have forecast. "I think it's fair to say we're going to have at least a 25 (basis-point cut), but, that being said, I do believe we have greater embedded inflation in the world than we've ever seen," Fink said at a panel during Saudi Arabia's annual flagship investment conference, the Future Investment Initiative. "We have government and policy that is much more inflationary. Immigration — our policies of onshoring, all of this — no one is asking the question 'at what cost.' Historically we were, I would say, a more consumer-driven economy, the cheapest products were the best and the most progressive way of politicking," he noted. Fink's mention of onshoring highlighted the U.S.'s efforts in recent years — particularly in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic — to reduce dependence on foreign supply chains and to invest in domestic jobs, particularly in manufacturing. The Biden administration's legislation, such as the Inflation Reduction Act and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, have pushed those efforts forward. Those changes can contribute to increases in the price of goods, as American workers are paid more than those in many offshore manufacturing destinations like China. "Today, I think we have governmental policies that are embedded inflationary, and, with that being said, we're not gonna see interest rates as low as people are forecasting," Fink said. The Fed cut its benchmark rate by 50 basis points in September, signaling a turning point in its management of the U.S. economy and in its outlook for inflation. In late-September reports, strategists at J.P. Morgan and Fitch Ratings predicted two additional interest rate cuts by the end of 2024, and expect such reductions to continue into 2025. America's consumer price index, a key inflation gauge, was up 2.4% in September compared to the same period in 2023, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. That figure is a tick down from the 2.5% print of August, meaning that price growth slowed. The September reading was also the smallest annual one since February 2021. A group of CEOs speaking on a subsequent panel at the event — which included Wall Street hegemons such as the CEOs of Goldman Sachs, Carlyle, Morgan Stanley, Standard Chartered and State Street — were asked to raise their hand if they thought two additional rate cuts would be implemented by the Fed this year.

Title: Ireland captaincy comes at the right time for Caelan Doris
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/rugby/2024/10/29/ireland-captaincy-comes-at-the-right-time-for-caelan-doris/
Time Published: 2024-10-29T06:00:00Z
Full Content:
Timing is everything, it’s said. If it is meant to happen, it will, at the right point for the right reasons. Before last season’s Six Nations, at the start of this World Cup cycle, it was still a tad too soon to have the Irish captaincy thrust upon Caelan Doris, whereas now feels like the right point, both for him and the team. Although he captained the Blackrock College senior cup team at school in 2015-16 and also the Irish Under-20s at the 2018 Junior World Championships, Doris gave the distinct impression that on progressing into the senior ranks he was happy to stay in the trenches. It was not until New Year’s Day last season that Doris first captained Leinster against Ulster at the RDS, by which stage he was 25 and had played 72 times for the province. Just over a month later Doris led Ireland for the first time too, against Italy in the Six Nations and he wasn’t too proud to admit he had his reservations. “I’m enjoying it a lot more at this stage than when it first came about,” Doris admitted in the wake of captaining Leinster to their 24-6 win over the Lions last Saturday and on foot of being anointed by Andy Farrell as Irish captain last week. “I would have said to you guys in the first couple of weeks, the sort of self-doubt and the bit of ‘impostor syndrome’ and feeling that there’s new responsibilities and getting used to it all. “I’ve had quite a few weeks at it now and things feel a bit more comfortable, and I’m starting to enjoy it more. I’m feeling growth in the role, I’m feeling a bit of my capacity expanding a little bit, but I know there’s still a ton of room for growth. “I’m by no means the leader I want to be yet, the leader I believe I can get to, where I’ve seen the likes of Johnny [Sexton] and Pete [O’Mahony] are at that stage of their careers. It’s an enjoyable journey, I guess, and I’m enjoying the pushing through the comfort zone.” Doris needed cajoling, and the investment in him becoming captaincy material was initiated by Stuart Lancaster and Farrell. “I captained in school and at underage as well but they really pushed it out of me when it wasn’t always the comfortable thing for me, and especially as a young player. I wanted to focus more on me and get the best out of myself and was trying to get a grip on how to be a professional and how to prepare as best as possible for my game. “But while doing that, Stuart Lancaster, from quite a young age when I came into Leinster and with all young players to be fair, he was saying: ‘Find your voice, and if you have a point speak up’ etc. “So, the two of them probably pushed it out of me a little bit and I’m grateful for that now at this stage, definitely.” A run of games as Leinster captain toward the end of last season helped him further acquit himself with the role before, he led Ireland to that wonderful second Test win in Durban. Whereas Doris captained Leinster and Ireland for the first time at the age of 25, and is now 26, by comparison Brian O’Driscoll was 23 when he first captained Ireland to an 18-9 win over Australia at Lansdowne Road in November 2002, and he was 25 when made full-time captain before the 2004 Six Nations. Granted, O’Driscoll did not assume the Leinster captaincy until 2005. There is no written rule about this, and ultimately O’Driscoll relinquished the captaincy of his province in September 2008 at the age of 28. But Doris does not seem too perturbed about the dual responsibility being thrust upon him. “No, I don’t think so. I’m definitely excited by it and I’m looking forward to it. I love being in both environments and we’re looked after very well. I’ve only played three games so far this season so when I’m not playing there are other guys who are leading more that week. It’s not as relentless as it might seem. “Of course, you’re the official captain but there are so many other guys who are capable of leading, and are leading, as well. So, there’s not too much weight on my shoulders.” Akin to O’Driscoll, Doris can also lead by example. “The main message from both talking to the coaches, through the conversation of me being captain, but also when I’ve gone to the likes of Sexto or Pete, or even Garry [Ringrose] and James [Ryan], everyone’s main point is ‘the most important thing is the 80 minutes; your performance, lead through actions’. “I’ve got a pretty good process in how I prepare, and I can’t let up on that while looking after everything else or the added responsibilities. My focus is still trying to prepare myself, while also taking other things into account, but not letting up on that in order to do the others. I’m trying to do that.” A Friday night under lights against the All Blacks adds to his sense of anticipation. “Big time. I love Friday night games. I think it’s conducive to a pretty good atmosphere. I like evening games anyway. I haven’t thought about it too much yet given the start of the season with Leinster but the excitement is definitely going to build.” As to anyone who says these autumnal games are not competitive, but friendlies, he laughs and says: “Just watch the game. “They are by no means friendly encounters. There’s extreme levels of competition, there’s always something on the line. Look at any of the games we’ve played against them over the last number of years. I think there’s mutual respect built. “We’ve obviously always respected them given their legacy in rugby really but I think they’re starting to respect us more over the last five/six years, probably since 2016 really. It’s a good rivalry and I’m looking forward to getting stuck into it.” Gerry Thornley is Rugby Correspondent of The Irish Times Sign up to the Irish Times weekly rugby digest for the view from the press box with Gerry Thornley © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Bitcoin Dominates $3.4 Billion October Crypto Inflows—What’s Behind the Boom?

Investment activity in digital assets surged almost throughout October, as crypto investment products, especially that of Bitcoin, experienced substantial inflows, according to the latest data released by CoinShares. Last week alone, global crypto funds attracted $901 million in net inflows, pushing the total for the month to $3.4 billion. According to CoinShares, out of the total fund flows recorded, Bitcoin-centric investment products captured the lion’s share of inflows, with $920 million in net additions over the past week. US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recorded $997.6 million in net inflows, led largely by BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). Bitcoin’s dominance was notable, with blockchain equities and Solana-based products also seeing inflows of $12.2 million and $10.8 million, respectively. However, other Bitcoin-based products, including those outside US markets, faced some net outflows. While Bitcoin maintained strong inflows, Ethereum-based funds recorded net outflows of $34.7 million last week, signaling a decrease in investor interest. CoinShares reported that Ethereum’s price ratio to Bitcoin had fallen to its lowest point since April 2021, which could be contributing to this outflow trend. The data suggests that while Ethereum has seen gains in the past, investors are now focusing more on Bitcoin, possibly anticipating future regulatory clarity and further mainstream adoption with developments like spot ETFs. Geographically, US-based crypto funds attracted a substantial $906 million in net inflows last week. In contrast, other regions saw mixed results, with funds based in Sweden, Canada, Brazil, and Hong Kong collectively experiencing $29.1 million in net outflows. This difference highlights the United States’ growing role in shaping the global crypto investment market, especially as American firms like BlackRock and Fidelity expand their crypto offerings. According to CoinShares’ Head of Research, James Butterfill reveals that the we political climate likely influences the recent Bitcoin price movements and increase in inflows. He noted that Republican gains in the polls correlate with increased interest in Bitcoin investments. This suggests that market participants may see a shift in political power as favourable to digital assets, potentially driving anticipation of regulatory reforms or even greater crypto acceptance. CoinShares report shows that the October influx represents roughly 12% of assets under management (AUM) in digital asset funds and marks the fourth-largest month for inflows on record. This brings the year-to-date total to $27 billion, almost tripling the previous high of $10.5 billion set in 2021.

Meet Samuel Edyme, Nickname - HIM-buktu. A web3 content writer, journalist, and aspiring trader, Edyme is as versatile as they come. With a knack for words and a nose for trends, he has penned pieces for numerous industry player, including AMBCrypto, Blockchain.News, and Blockchain Reporter, among others. Edyme’s foray into the crypto universe is nothing short of cinematic. His journey began not with a triumphant investment, but with a scam. Yes, a Ponzi scheme that used crypto as payment roped him in. Rather than retreating, he emerged wiser and more determined, channeling his experience into over three years of insightful market analysis. Before becoming the voice of reason in the crypto space, Edyme was the quintessential crypto degen. He aped into anything that promised a quick buck, anything ape-able, learning the ropes the hard way. These hands-on experience through major market events—like the Terra Luna crash, the wave of bankruptcies in crypto firms, the notorious FTX collapse, and even CZ’s arrest—has honed his keen sense of market dynamics. When he isn’t crafting engaging crypto content, you’ll find Edyme backtesting charts, studying both forex and synthetic indices. His dedication to mastering the art of trading is as relentless as his pursuit of the next big story. Away from his screens, he can be found in the gym, airpods in, working out and listening to his favorite artist, NF. Or maybe he’s catching some Z’s or scrolling through Elon Musk’s very own X platform—(oops, another screen activity, my bad…) Well, being an introvert, Edyme thrives in the digital realm, preferring online interaction over offline encounters—(don’t judge, that’s just how he is built). His determination is quite unwavering to be honest, and he embodies the philosophy of continuous improvement, or “kaizen,” striving to be 1% better every day. His mantras, “God knows best” and “Everything is still on track,” reflect his resilient outlook and how he lives his life. In a nutshell, Samuel Edyme was born efficient, driven by ambition, and perhaps a touch fierce. He’s neither artistic nor unrealistic, and certainly not chauvinistic. Think of him as Bruce Willis in a train wreck—unflappable. Edyme is like trading in your car for a jet—bold. He’s the guy who’d ask his boss for a pay cut just to prove a point—(uhhh…). He is like watching your kid take his first steps. Imagine Bill Gates struggling with rent—okay, maybe that’s a stretch, but you get the idea, yeah. Unbelievable? Yes. Inconceivable? Perhaps. Edyme sees himself as a fairly reasonable guy, albeit a bit stubborn. Normal to you is not to him. He is not the one to take the easy road, and why would he? That’s just not the way he roll. He has these favorite lyrics from NF’s “Clouds” that resonate deeply with him: “What you think's probably unfeasible, I've done already a hundredfold.” PS—Edyme is HIM. HIM-buktu. Him-mulation. Him-Kardashian. Himon and Pumba. He even had his DNA tested, and guess what? He’s 100% Him-alayan. Screw it, he ate the opp. Disclaimer: The information found on NewsBTC is for educational purposes only.

Title: Bitcoin spikes to $71,500, 4% away from all-time high
URL: https://cryptobriefing.com/bitcoin-etf-inflow-surges/
Time Published: 2024-10-29T03:54:11Z

Share this article Bitcoin has rallied over 5% to $71,500 and is now within striking distance of its all-time high of $73,700. The surge comes as the US presidential election is just days away. According to data from CoinGecko, the largest crypto asset by market cap broke the $70,000 price level on Monday after a minor correction last week, mostly driven by the escalating conflict in the Middle East and alleged regulatory scrutiny over Tether. Despite a sudden drop below $66,000, Bitcoin bounced back and consolidated within the $67,000-$68,000 range over the weekend. It ultimately broke out and soared to $70,000 for the first time in over four months. According to seasoned trader Peter Brandt, the post-halving advance may have started and Bitcoin may be entering a bullish phase. “The 5-month inverted expanding triangle has now been completed. Follow through will be important. The post-halving advance may have begun. The series of lower highs and lower lows since March has come to an end,” Brandt said in a recent post on X. As Crypto Briefing previously reported, certain key metrics pointed to a potential upward trend in the price of Bitcoin. The Bollinger Bands, an indicator used to assess price volatility, are at one of their tightest points in history. This “Bollinger Squeeze” often precedes periods of low volatility, which can lead to powerful price breakouts. In addition, the Miner Position Index (MPI), which measures the flow of Bitcoin from miners to exchanges, shows that Bitcoin miners are currently in an accumulation phase, while block rewards are on the rise. The combination of a low MPI and rising block rewards suggests a bullish outlook for Bitcoin. Demand for Bitcoin ETFs remains strong. According to data tracked by Farside Investors, US-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded approximately $3 billion in net inflows in the last two weeks. These ETFs started this week on a high note, collectively drawing around $479 million in net capital with no outflows reported. BlackRock continued its Bitcoin buying spree, logging over $315 million in net buying on Monday. Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan sees reaccelerating Bitcoin ETF inflows among key factors that could propel Bitcoin to six-figure prices, together with the upcoming presidential election, increasing whale accumulation, reduced Bitcoin supply post-halving, and global monetary adjustments. Analysts at Standard Chartered project that Bitcoin could reach approximately $73,000 by Election Day on November 5. Plus, the analysts suggest that if former President Donald Trump wins the election, Bitcoin may surge to around $80,000, with a potential increase of up to $125,000 by the end of the year if Republicans secure control of Congress. Analysts at Bitfinex also anticipate that the US presidential election could serve as a catalyst for Bitcoin’s rally, potentially pushing its price beyond $73,666 due to heightened market activity and volatility surrounding the election. Meanwhile, several other experts believe that Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory remains intact regardless of the electoral outcome. Steven Lubka, head of private clients at Swan Bitcoin, anticipates that Bitcoin will hit six-figure prices due to its strong correlation with fiscal and monetary conditions rather than political leadership.

Title: FET: a pathway to endless opportunities for students
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/ireland/education/2024/10/29/fet-a-pathway-that-provides-opportunities/
Time Published: 2024-10-29T03:15:00Z

It gets less fanfare than the CAO, but further education and training (FET) offers a range of career-focused options for school-leavers – and it would be a mistake not to explore them. Over the past few years, I’ve spoken with countless students who thrived in apprenticeships, post-Leaving Cert (PLC) courses and traineeships. Some were high achievers who fell short of the points needed for their degree programme, and did a year-long PLC in a local college of further education, which opened the door to their CAO course of choice. Others wanted a vocational, work-ready qualification and found it in an apprenticeship, allowing them to earn as they learned. One student got great results in his Leaving Cert, but decided that a year in a PLC would serve as a bridge between school and college. “One in 10 adults in Ireland – around 423,000 people – were engaged in FET courses and apprenticeships last year,” says Maria Walshe, director of branding, communications and FET strategy implementation at Solas. “Fast becoming a prime destination for school-leavers, increasing numbers of students are now choosing the FET route. Last year, for example, course enrolments were up 11 per cent year on year for QQI level five and six courses, also known as PLCs.” Walshe says that not only is FET a smart choice for school-leavers in its own right, but also a pathway that provides opportunities that can take learners directly into careers, as well as offering progression routes to higher education. “For those unsure of their next step after school, FET can provide students with the option to set their own pace and to explore a subject or interest before applying to a four-year degree.” Paige Tomlin, a 19-year-old school-leaver, is doing a PLC course in computer science at Blackrock College of Further Education. “I was one of the fortunate students to be offered computer science as a Leaving Cert subject, and I really enjoyed it,” she says. “I loved the coding aspect and knew that this was an area I would like to work in. But I didn’t do well enough in my Leaving Cert to get the points. In my research, I learned that the PLC could be a gateway for computer science in TU Dublin or DCU, so I went for it. “The course involves five days a week of classes, but it’s not too intense as there are gaps between some of the lectures. It also includes work experience hours, and there’s even an opportunity to go on an eight-day course in Portugal. “There’s coding, maths, web development, databases, spreadsheets and communications – where we have had a chance to work on our CVs – on the course so, although I do want to go to college, there are also opportunities for us to go straight into the workforce.” Unlike third level, the fees are minimal, and this year Tomlin only had to pay a €50 registration fee. (It should be noted that some PLCs, particularly in art and design, may require students to buy equipment or supplies, and so can end up costing more). Tomlin says that she has really enjoyed the course. “We’ve done collaborative work in group projects, and we’ve worked solo. I’ve made friends on the course and am really glad I took it on.” The possibilities are endless with FET, says Walshe. “They take students into a diverse range of exciting careers, through courses in areas as diverse as commis chef, animal care, games production, cyber security, personal training and applied science. “The beauty of FET is that it is for everyone. Available in every county and delivered by the FET colleges under the provision of the 16 Education and Training Boards (ETBs) across the country, FET can take students into a world of careers, all without the need to travel far from home. FET courses are available in every county and delivered by the FET colleges under the provision of the 16 education and training boards (ETBs) across the country. “FET can take students into a world of careers, all without the need to travel far from home,” says Walshe. “There are many opportunities for students to discover FET courses on offer in their local community, as well as pathways from FET to university. Open days are run by FET colleges on an ongoing basis and are definitely worth checking out.” Your regular guide to the latest education news, analysis and opinion, as well as classroom resources, posters and lots more © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

The company reported about 3.8 per cent volume growth in Q2-FY25 and expects healthy growth (15 per cent+) in H2FY25, driven by both W&C businesses with focused approach to capture demand from infrastructure and emerging sectors. ICICI Bank has reported six glorious years of performance since Sandeep Bakhshi took charge as MD & CEO on October 15, 2018. The bank has consistently beaten street estimates on one or the other metric, even as the macro environment changed considerably over the years. The short-term outlook is bullish for Rainbow Children’s Medicare. The stock has begun the week by surging over 5 per cent on Monday breaking above the ₹1,450-₹1,470 resistance zone. Indeed, the stock has been moving up well since the middle of last week itself when the broader markets were falling. The region around ₹1,470 will now act as a very good resistance-turned-support. Intermediate dips are likely to get fresh buyers at lower levels. Comments BACK TO TOP Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences. They cannot be abusive or personal.

Indeed, the stock has been moving up well since the middle of last week itself when the broader markets were falling. The region around ₹1,470 will now act as a very good resistance-turned-support.

Title: Are ‘ETF Paper Bitcoins’ Suppressing BTC Prices? Analyst Provides Answers
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/etf-paper-bitcoin-suppressing-btc-prices-analyst/
Time Published: 2024-10-28T22:30:17Z

In a new YouTube video titled “There Is No ETF Paper Bitcoin,” Fred Krueger, an investor at the crypto hedge fund 2718.fund, delved into the growing concerns surrounding US spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) and their impact on the cryptocurrency’s price. Krueger aimed to dispel the fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) that have been circulating about “paper Bitcoin”—the notion that ETFs might be selling Bitcoin they do not actually possess—and to explain why Bitcoin’s price has not surged as dramatically as some might expect, despite significant ETF purchases. Krueger began his analysis by acknowledging the prevalent skepticism in the market. “There’s all this paper Bitcoin, and ETFs don’t really have the Bitcoin, and if they were buying all this Bitcoin, how come Bitcoin price is not higher?” he stated, encapsulating the core concerns of many investors. Historically, the concept of “paper Bitcoin” has been associated with exchanges that sold Bitcoin to customers without actually possessing the underlying assets. Krueger highlighted several high-profile instances where this practice led to significant losses for investors. He cited the case of Mt. Gox. Another example he provided was QuadrigaCX, a Canadian exchange that collapsed under mysterious circumstances. Founder Gerald Cotten allegedly died in India, taking with him the private keys to the exchange’s cold wallets, effectively locking away customer funds. “A lot of Canadians lost all their Bitcoin on this Quad exchange,” Krueger noted. These historical events have contributed to the current apprehension about ETFs and the possibility that they might be engaging in similar practices—selling Bitcoin they do not actually hold, thereby suppressing BTC’s price through artificial supply. However, Krueger argued that ETFs, particularly those managed by established financial institutions, operate under a fundamentally different framework compared to unregulated exchanges. Focusing on two leading ETFs—IBIT, the BlackRock ETF, and FBTC, the Fidelity ETF—Krueger emphasized the stringent regulatory oversight governing these entities. “Both of these ETFs are subject to very strict regulatory oversight, including the SEC but also other agencies in the US,” he stated. This comprehensive oversight includes requirements for complete transparency, regular audits, and the use of third-party custodians for asset verification. “They literally have to get a receipt of an asset from a third-party custodian,” Krueger added. In the case of IBIT, Coinbase serves as the third-party custodian. “Coinbase is itself a public company that is audited,” Krueger pointed out, noting that the public nature of Coinbase adds an additional layer of scrutiny and accountability. IBIT conducts audits of Coinbase, and both entities are subject to audits by the SEC and other regulatory bodies. For FBTC, custody is handled by Fidelity Digital Assets, a separate entity within Fidelity that specializes in the custody of digital assets, thereby ensuring specialized oversight and management. “The issuers of IBIT and FBTC are BlackRock and Fidelity, two of the largest and oldest financial institutions, and they have a vested interest in maintaining their reputation,” Krueger asserted. “Their reputation is at stake, and this is a big deal,” he emphasized, suggesting that these institutions would not risk their credibility by engaging in the sale of non-existent Bitcoin. Krueger contrasted BlackRock with entities like QuadrigaCX to underscore the disparity in regulatory compliance and operational scale. “BlackRock is highly regulated […] BlackRock has a robust corporate governance structure with committees for audit, risk, and compliance and very extensive internal controls,” Krueger added. Addressing the core concern about ETFs holding “paper Bitcoin,” Krueger provided specific data to refute this notion. “The reality is the ETFs have zero pure paper Bitcoin,” he stated unequivocally. He highlighted that IBIT holds approximately 403,000 actual Bitcoins, while FBTC holds about 185,000 actual Bitcoins. “Together, these two ETFs hold almost 3% of the world’s total Bitcoin, or 588,000 Bitcoins—I think it’s 2.9%,” he calculated. Krueger acknowledged that some skeptics have attempted to analyze Bitcoin movement between specific dates to challenge these holdings. However, he emphasized that the facts are clear and verifiable. “We know how much Bitcoin these ETFs have; we know that it’s accounted for, and that’s a reality,” he insisted. Turning to the question of why Bitcoin’s price has not increased more dramatically despite significant ETF inflows, Krueger offered a nuanced explanation. He noted that Bitcoin is, in fact, up by 60% since the introduction of the ETFs, translating to a $600 billion increase in market capitalization. This growth has been fueled by approximately $20 billion in net inflows into the ETFs, resulting in a price multiplier effect of about 30x. “That’s historically about normal, maybe a little on the low side but not terribly so,” he assessed. Krueger attributed the moderation in Bitcoin’s price growth to substantial selling pressures from various sources. “There’s been a bunch of selling,” he explained. He detailed that Germany sold $3 billion worth of Bitcoin as well as Mt. Gox holdings. Additionally, FTX sold its GBTC (Grayscale Bitcoin Trust) stake earlier in the year, and the Digital Currency Group (DCG) sold assets to resolve lawsuits. “We had a lot of selling,” Krueger summarized. Speculating on the potential impact absent these selling pressures, Krueger suggested that Bitcoin’s price could have been significantly higher. “We probably would be at $90k if there wasn’t any selling,” he posited. At press time, BTC traded at $68,752. Jake Simmons, a dedicated crypto journalist, has been passionate about Bitcoin since 2016 when he first learned about it.

His libertarian views reinforce his stance that just as the church was separated from the state, so too should money be freed from governmental control. For Jake, Bitcoin represents more than just an investment; it's a peaceful revolution. He envisions a future where Bitcoin fosters a sustainable and responsible financial framework for generations to come. His advocacy is not about opposition but about evolution, about laying the groundwork for a system that prioritizes transparency and equity over secrecy and inequality. As a journalist, Jake’s articles are crafted with the precision of a scholar and the passion of a true believer. He provides not only news but also thoughtful analysis that connects the dots between daily developments and larger economic theories. His work is a beacon for those lost in the technical jargon often associated with crypto discussions, illuminating the practical implications and benefits of these technologies. In summary, Jake Simmons is not just reporting on a revolution; he wants to be part of it, fully committed to enhancing public understanding and adoption of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. His work is more than just a collection of articles; it’s a resource, a guide, and a companion for anyone ready to explore the potential of this digital frontier.

Title: Poll: One in Three Say Migration Should Be Top Priority for the President's First 100 Days in 2025

Thirty-five percent of Americans say the top priority for the first 100 days of the next presidency should be migration, according to an Ipsos survey for Reuters. That one-on-three score is more than three times the 11 percent share of the second-ranked “First 100 Days” priority — income inequality. Taxes — and health care — score only a 10 percent share. The priority rankings are very different from what voters say when they are asked about the most important issues, Ipsos noted: The economy is the seen as the most important problem [for Washington, DC] for 27% of registered voters, followed by political extremism or threats to democracy (22%), and then immigration (16%). The First 100 Days answer suggests that President Kalama Harris might quickly press Congress to pass a law that would raise immigration levels under the guise of improving border security. But those survey results also suggest that a reelected President Donald Trump will face pressure to focus on curbing migration. That focus would be different from his first term when he quickly pivoted away from migration and pushed a large tax cut through Congress. That 2017 shift followed pressure from Trump’s business allies, many who still demand that government invite more economic migrants. “The U.S. economy needs immigration, and the ebb and flow of humans [across the border] is the market responding to demand,” the Wall Street Journal declared Sunday. “The Biden administration’s decision to use legal parole to accept 30,000 migrants a month from Venezuela, Cuba, Haiti, and Nicaragua is a common-sense and humane approach to managing migration,” it declared. If Trump is in the Oval Office, Democrats — and some Republicans — will resist his promise of mass deportations. But many Republicans recognize they need to fulfill campaign promises. “There’s about 4.5 million who would be the first priority for that, people who’ve already committed crimes,” House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) said on October 24. “They’re in the system now [for] shoplifting, or whatever it is … or [having] done things that are untoward or unlawful.” “We’ve got 20, 25 million illegal aliens who are here in the country. What do we do with them?” Sen. JD Vance said in his October 1 Vice Presidential debate. “I think the first thing that we do is we start with the criminal migrants. About a million of those people have committed some form of crime, in addition to crossing the border illegally.” Any debate about migration levels will likely include a debate over the damage caused to ordinary Americans’ workplace productivity and their declining family fertility. In Canada and the United Kingdom, birth rates have crashed amid wage cuts and housing spikes caused by advocates for more migration. Bloomberg reported Monday: The fertility rate in England Wales fell to a record low in 2023, as financial pressures and wider societal shifts put young people off starting a family. Women had an average of 1.44 children, the lowest figure since records began in 1938 and down sharply since 2010 when the rate was 1.94, data from the Office for National Statistics showed on Monday. In London the rate was even lower at 1.35. The figures will set off alarm bells over a worsening demographic crisis that is set to ramp up the pressure on the workforce and the public finances. The national level is well below the natural replacement rate of 2.1 In contrast, Larry Fink, the head of the $10 trillion Blackrock investment group, has urged governments to reduce the migration that is used to inflate their consumer economies and to instead raise the productivity of their nation’s citizens. “We always used to think [a] shrinking population is a cause for negative [economic] growth,” Fink said at a pro-globalist event in April hosted by the World Economic Forum in Saudi Arabia. He continued: But in my conversations with the leadership of these large, developed countries [such as China, and Japan] that have xenophobic anti-immigration policies, they don’t allow anybody to come in — [so they have] shrinking demographics — these countries will rapidly develop robotics and AI and technology … If a promise of all that transforms productivity, which most of us think it will [emphasis added] — we’ll be able to elevate the standard living in countries, the standard of living for individuals, even with shrinking populations. Canada’s government has recently trimmed its massive immigration inflow, boosting bankers’ hopes that Canadian companies will redirect funds to raise the nation’s stalled productivity. “We need to dispel the narrative that slower population growth will be bad for the economy,” said an October 24 report by Robert Kavcic, the senior economist at BMO, a major bank based in Montreal. “Real GDP per capita has been stagnant on balance since 2016 … One can argue that the surge in [migrants] has diverted resources to housing and allowed firms to lean on low-cost labour, at the expense of productivity,” Kavcic wrote.

Title: Alternative Assets Shine Amid Pre-Election Market Uncertainty
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/10/28/alternative-assets-shine-amid-pre-election-market-uncertainty/
Time Published: 2024-10-28T19:50:49Z

Investmments and asset allocation concept. Where to Invest? Newspaper and direction sign with ... [+] investment options. 3d illustration With only one week remaining before the U.S. presidential election, there’s a growing sense of uncertainty in the air. Investors are wondering how to position their money, bracing for the possibility of significant volatility and market shifts. While some hedge funds are making bold moves on so-called “Trump trades,” we at U.S. Global Investors see things differently. In fact, I share billionaire hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones’ recent outlook on gold and Bitcoin (which validates what I have been writing about for many years). Like him, we currently favor alternative assets as the smart play going forward. It’s not that we’re betting against stocks or the economy, which we believe will do well over time no matter who wins the White House next month. Nevertheless, the writing is clearly on the wall: Ballooning U.S. debt and geopolitical tensions all point to the need for a strong hedge. You won’t be surprised to read that the U.S. debt situation has spiraled out of control. Just 25 years ago, the national debt was a little under 60% of GDP. Today, that rate has doubled to 120%. According to Paul Tudor Jones, founder and CEO of Tudor Investment Corp., this puts the U.S. in a precarious position—one that’s unsustainable in the long run unless serious action is taken to rein in government spending. We all know that politicians have a knack for promising more spending (in the Democrats’ case) or tax cuts (in the Republicans’ case) to keep voters happy. It’s easy to see why Jones is concerned that either approach will only exacerbate the debt problem. As he pointed out, the U.S. is “going to be broke really quick unless we get serious about dealing with our spending issues.” That’s not just a dramatic soundbite—it’s a reality check. The federal deficit for 2024 soared above $1.8 trillion, up 8% from the previous year. Meanwhile, the debt burden, which is rapidly nearing $36 trillion, shows no signs of easing. U.S. deficit spending continues to spiral out of control When the government keeps printing money to finance its spending, the inevitable result is inflation. And in times of inflation, the purchasing power of traditional assets like bonds erodes. That’s why Jones favors assets that perform well in inflationary environments such as gold, silver, commodities and Bitcoin. I agree wholeheartedly with this assessment. Think about it: Why would you want to own fixed-income assets when interest rates are being adjusted and are likely to be lower than the inflation rate? Long-dated bonds are particularly vulnerable. U.S. banks, remember, are still dealing with billions of dollars in unrealized losses on their fixed-income positions. According to Florida Atlantic University’s bank screener, Bank of America’s unrealized losses on held-to-maturity investments in the first quarter were a staggering $110 billion, more than any other U.S. institution by far. The Fed will likely try to “inflate” its way out of this mess, meaning it will keep nominal interest rates lower than inflation to support economic growth. For investors, this means that preserving wealth will require smart positioning in alternative assets. Jones is already betting against the bond market— “I am clearly not going to own any fixed-income,” he told CNBC last week—and I believe many investors would be wise to take a similar approach. Let’s start with gold and silver. Both have been go-to haven assets for centuries, and for good reason. When geopolitical tensions have risen, when inflation has reared its ugly head and/or when there’s been uncertainty in the markets, investors have flocked to gold and silver. This year is no exception. We’ve seen gold shatter records multiple times in 2024, with prices rising more than 32% year-to-date, the metal’s best annual growth since 1979. According to data from the World Gold Council, gold has consistently outperformed both inflation and the growth rate of the world economy. From 1971 to 2023, gold’s compound annual growth rate (CAGR) was 8%, compared to 4% for the U.S. consumer price index (CPI) and 7.8% for global GDP growth. Gold has kept pace with global GDP and exceeded inflation Silver, often dubbed the “poor man’s gold,” is another asset that deserves attention. With its industrial applications, especially in the green energy sector, silver has strong potential for future growth. According to one projection, the clean energy transition could dramatically increase the demand for silver in photovoltaic (PV) technology, potentially consuming between 85% and a jaw-dropping 98% of current global silver reserves by 2050. Now, let’s talk about Bitcoin. The world’s largest digital asset has quickly become a preferred store of value for many investors, especially those looking to hedge against fiat currency depreciation. Nearly half of all traditional hedge funds currently maintain exposure to cryptos, including Bitcoin. Institutions are also backing Bitcoin with the same enthusiasm. Just look at BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF. It’s one of the fastest-growing ETFs in financial history, with assets under management now over $26 billion. That’s no small feat. Bitcoin’s decentralized nature, capped supply and growing institutional acceptance make it an attractive asset in times of uncertainty. Like gold, it’s a hedge against inflation, but it also offers the potential for significant upside as more investors and institutions recognize its value. Now, I know many of you are wondering: “What about the election? What if Trump wins? What if Harris wins?” Here’s a news flash for you: Over the long run, it may not matter as much as you think. Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, made a great point recently when he said that he’s “tired of hearing this is the biggest election in your lifetime. The reality is over time, it doesn’t matter.” While hedge funds are taking positions in “Trump trades” like private prisons and fossil fuels, we believe that trying to time the market based on election outcomes is a risky game. Yes, the election will cause short-term volatility, but if you’re in the right assets—like gold, silver and Bitcoin—I believe you’ll be well-positioned to weather the storm. One Community.

Title: Is NVIDIA (NVDA) The Best Performing Large-Cap Stock in the Last 3 Years?
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-nvda-best-performing-large-130212301.html
Time Published: 2024-10-28T13:02:12Z

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Best-Performing S&P 500 Stocks in the Last 3 Years. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other best performing S&P 500 stocks in the last year. The past three years have been a bit of a roller coaster ride for the stock market. We saw how the pandemic wrecked several industries’ balance sheets and supply chains. Following the global vaccination drive, economies around the world and in the US opened up with a vengeance, resulting in huge stimulus checks. This, along with the energy and food-price shock and disrupted supply chains, was blamed for the persistently high inflation, which peaked at 9.1% in June 2022. The Fed had already started hiking interest rates to ease inflation and work towards a soft landing, with the first hike coming in March 2022. By July 2023, the central bank had raised it to 5.25-5.50%, making borrowing all the more challenging. The tech industry had kept the momentum from 2020 lockdowns well into 2021. The largest tech companies out of the 500 biggest companies trading in the US grew by an average of 33% from the start of 2021 to the end. However, the tech industry was heavily impacted by the rate hikes that followed in 2022. This resulted in the large-cap aggregate tech indices losing nearly 29% of the gains made in the year prior, as prospects for growth became bleak. The upper percentiles of the energy industry in market cap had a similar run in 2021 but remained immune to the economic downturn that followed in 2022, posting gains of 59% for the year. The aggressive rally in the energy industry resulted from a combination of supply-chain disruptions, OPEC production cuts, the Russia-Ukraine war, and the revision of energy sourcing in Europe, directing much of the energy capital inflow to the US from the continent. Coming back to tech – the industry wouldn’t stay on the sidelines for long. The start of 2023 to the end saw the large-cap US-traded tech equity grow by 38.6%. At the core of the resurgence was the AI-led boom combined with semiconductor supply chains that had recovered substantially by then. Other factors included CHIPS and Science Act, improved efficiency in the industry, and a rate-hike slowdown. The US economy looks to be on schedule for a soft landing, according to a Financial Times’ survey of economists. This is on the back of the Fed’s rate reduction of 50 basis points in September 2024, which, as noted by the CFO of a large US bank Denis Colman, is a signal towards a soft landing. This is not a sure shot, however, since some experts remain wary and continue worrying about a recession. For instance, Piper Sandler’s Chief Global Economist Nancy Lazar noted that the “jumbo” rate cut by the Fed is reminiscent of the similar Fed policy easing of 2001 and 2007, which couldn’t avert the problem. However, according to analysts, the case for a soft landing appears to be justified given the September jobs report and other improving indicators. The September report by BLS shows that the non-farm payrolls grew by 254,000 for the month, exceeding economists’ estimates by 41%. Moreover, the July and August reports, which had spooked some economists, were also revised by a combined 72,000 new hires, which wasn’t without historical precedent. Further, grocery prices, adjusted for growth in real wages, are back to the pre-pandemic levels. It took 3.59 hours of work to afford a week’s worth of groceries in November 2019 and took 3.57 hours of work to afford them in September 2024. Moving ahead, Rob Rowe, Regional Research Director and Head of Global Strategy at a large US bank is ‘tactically bullish’ on the back of continuing tech recovery and the markets “pricing in a soft landing”. They expect at-least 25 basis-point rate cuts at each Fed meeting through year-end. With regards to tech industry, their outlook suggests selectivity. In response to a question about their outlook on the tech industry, they said: “I think we have to be selective here. We like Semis as a recovery play but we’re kind of underweight on software.” Rowe has a bearish outlook on oil, given geopolitical variables don’t change in a way that leads to oil prices shooting up. For our list, we have picked stocks from the index in question that have had the highest 3-year annualized returns and we ranked them as such, in order of their 3-year CAGR. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. 3Y CAGR: 82.08% NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), for all intents and purposes, is considered the driving force behind the AI boom, especially on the hardware side. Nvidia’s core business revolves around designing Graphic Processing Units (GPUs). The company’s biggest market is the gaming industry since GPUs are almost essential for high-performance rendering due to their parallel processing capabilities. As it turns out, GPUs are also incredibly useful for training AI models for the same reason, since AI models require a lot of matrix calculations simultaneously. It goes without saying that Nvidia isn’t the sole GPU designer but what put it at an advantage over its competitors is its proprietary parallel computing platform – CUDA. Having a GPU market share of 70.5% as of 2016, Nvidia recognized the need for a programmable architecture very early since programming parallel processing is recognized as notoriously difficult. The CUDA platform is now supported by a library of thousands of specific applications, which makes it hard to compete with Nvidia in the space of parallel programming platforms. This, coupled with the explosive demand for GPUs for training AI models, resulted in NVDA becoming the most valuable company in the world in June 2024 before Apple regained the top spot for itself. NVDA grew at an annualized rate of 82% over the past three years, and has gained nearly 212% over the past year and 184% year-to-date. Nvidia’s highly anticipated GPU – Blackwell – is expected to offer substantial inference performance gains over its previous GPUs, and is already experiencing a high level of demand from hyperscalers. The GPU will be rolled out in Q4, 2024, but has already been booked out for 12 months. This is what Stacy Rasgon, a Bernstein senior analyst, had to say about NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) in one of the latest CNBC programs: “People are getting excited about the story again as we approach earnings, year-end, and next year when the new platform with Blackwell starts to ramp up. By all indications—based on supply chain checks and everything else—demand for this product looks off the charts.” The analyst believes the stock is trading at a discount: “It’s much cheaper today than it was before the run started a year and a half ago. The stock has risen significantly, but earnings have increased even more than the stock.” Overall, NVDA ranks 2nd on our list of best performing S&P 500 stocks in the last year. While we acknowledge the potential of the best-performing S&P500 stocks in the Last 3 Years, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

BlackRock, the largest asset manager in the world, is now holding tens of billions of dollars worth of Bitcoin (BTC), the firm’s data shows. According to the asset management’s disclosures, BlackRock holds 403,725 BTC worth $26.98 billion in its iShares Bitcoin Trust exchange-traded fund (ETF). Blockchain tracking firm Lookonchain says that in the last two weeks alone, BlackRock has gobbled up 34,085 BTC worth $2.3 billion. The iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) went live on January 5th of this year and has since delivered 44.80% returns as of September 30th. In a recent report, BlackRock, a firm with over $10 trillion in assets under management, said that Bitcoin could act as a hedge against the United States’ mounting debt and other macroeconomic concerns. “While Bitcoin has shown instances of short-term co-movements with equities and other ‘risk assets,’ over the longer term its fundamental drivers are starkly different, and in many cases inverted versus most traditional investment assets. As the global investment community grapples with rising geopolitical tensions, concerns over the state of US debt and deficits and increased political instability around the world, Bitcoin may be seen as an increasingly unique diversifier against some of these fiscal, monetary and geopolitical risk factors investors may face elsewhere in their portfolio.” At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $67,735.
