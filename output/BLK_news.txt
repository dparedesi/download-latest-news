JPMorgan said Thursday it had debuted a new blockchain-based tool that streamlines distribution and servicing of alternative investment funds as the bank pushes deeper into tokenization. The platform, dubbed Kinexys Fund Flow and developed by the bank's digital asset arm Kinexys by JPMorgan, aims to give fund managers, transfer agents and distributors a shared, real-time view of investor activity while reducing manual reconciliation and cutting delays in capital movement. The first live transaction with the tool involved multiple J.P. Morgan business lines: Asset Management, the Private Bank and Kinexys Digital Assets. Fund administrator Citco also participated. This is the latest step in JPMorgan’s broader push to apply blockchain tech and tokenization for traditional finance, a trend that's gaining traction among major financial institutions. The bank has been an early mover, developing JPM Coin in 2019 and launching its blockchain unit, Onyx, in 2020. That division, now integrated under Kinexys, conducted blockchain-based repo trades, cross-border payments and tokenized asset settlements with partners including BlackRock and Siemens. The bank plans a broader rollout of Kynexis Fund Flow in early next year, according to a press release shared with CoinDesk.

Title: WisdomTree Debuts 14 Tokenized Funds on Plume Network
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/10/30/wisdomtree-launches-14-tokenized-funds-on-plume-network
Time Published: 2025-10-30T15:00:00Z

Asset manager WisdomTree has debuted 14 tokenized funds on Plume, a blockchain designed for real-world asset (RWA) finance, expanding access for institutional investors to regulated on-chain investment products. The funds, available through WisdomTree Connect, include the firm’s Government Money Market Digital Fund and CRDT Private Credit and Alternative Income Fund, allowing investors to hold, transfer, and settle positions directly on Plume’s blockchain network, according to an emailed announcement on Thursday. The listings are part of WisdomTree’s multi-chain strategy to make its regulated products accessible across multiple blockchains. As part of the rollout, Galaxy Digital said it will allocate $10 million to WisdomTree’s Government Money Market Digital Fund, underscoring early institutional participation. “WisdomTree’s tokenized funds exemplify how regulated products can thrive in a compliant, permissionless environment,” Luke Xiao, head of partnerships at Plume, said in Thursday's announcement. Unlike general-purpose blockchains such as Ethereum or Polygon, Plume integrates KYC and AML compliance directly at the protocol level, offering built-in safeguards such as wallet screening and sanctions enforcement. Plume, which recently won registration as a transfer agent with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), claims more than 276,000 RWA holders and about $600 million in tokenized assets, making it the largest blockchain by RWA participants. For WisdomTree, the move extends its onchain footprint beyond Ethereum and Stellar. The company, which manages over $100 billion in traditional assets, has about $650 million in tokenized assets under management. Its digital funds are SEC-registered 1940 Act products, allowing onchain transfers between verified wallets via soulbound NFTs that maintain AML and KYC controls. “By adding Plume, investors gain access to diversified tokenized fund strategies and more efficient settlement, while maintaining compliance standards,” said Maredith Hannon, Head of Business Development for Digital Assets at WisdomTree. The partnership also underscores growing competition among asset managers – alongside Franklin Templeton and BlackRock – to bring regulated investment vehicles onchain, as institutions explore blockchain’s potential to streamline operations and open new channels for distribution and liquidity.

Title: Who backed Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package? Here's how Tesla shareholders voted on CEO's compensation last year

Only six days are left for Tesla's Annual General Meeting and a decision on CEO Elon Musk's $1 trillion compensation package. Last month, the electric vehicle giant's board proposed a groundbreaking compensation package to motivate Musk to stay actively involved with Tesla for the next 10 years, and the shareholders are set to vote on it. However, several critics, including Democratic US state leaders and union officials, have criticised the sizable package and launched a campaign to reject the offer, Reuters reported. The shareholders are scheduled to vote on November 6. Several attempts have been made to prevent earlier record payouts to Musk, such as his $56 billion compensation plan for 2018, which investors reapproved last year despite ongoing legal challenges, it added. Here's a look at Tesla's five largest shareholders, excluding Musk, and how they voted for last year’s ratification of the CEO's 2018 pay package. Investment firm Vanguard has 251,390,681 shares and a stake worth $116 billion in Tesla as of June 30, 2025, according to Nasdaq data. The company owns 7% of Tesla, making it the biggest shareholder after Musk, who holds a 13% share. Last year, Vanguard voted for Musk's pay package despite opposing it for 2018 due to its potential size, Reuters reported. BlackRock, which reportedly has nearly 6% share in Tesla and a more than $95 billion stake, had 205,962,777 shares as of June 30, 2025. In a release last year, BlackRock said the company voted in favour of Musk's pay package. Global financial services company State Street is the third-highest shareholder of Tesla, excluding Elon Musk. The company has a stake worth $52 billion with 113,418,687 shares. State Street reportedly voted against Musk's whopping pay package in 2024, according to an X post by Sawyer Merritt, a Tesla investor. The asset manager had a nearly $29.9 million stake in Tesla and 64,767,993 shares as of June 30, 2025. Geode Capital owns nearly 1.8% stake in Tesla. Last year, the company voted for Musk's compensation. Investment bank JP Morgan Chase has 46,015,610 shares in the EV giant, worth $21.2 billion as of June 30, 2025. With a share of over 1% in Tesla, the bank voted in favour of Musk's pay package, Merritt noted. In September, Tesla's board proposed a $1 trillion compensation plan for CEO Elon Musk. The payout depends on growing the company's market capitalisation from roughly $1.1 trillion to $8.5 trillion and achieving various operational goals and targets, Reuters reported The board plans to award Musk up to 423.7 million performance-based restricted shares, which amounts to roughly 12% of the company's current shares. These will be distributed in 12 equal tranches. It further outlines 12 market capitalisation goals, including $2 trillion mark, then nine increments of $500 billion each, and concluding with two $1 trillion milestones, totalling $8.5 trillion. The EV maker has set 12 operational milestones, such as deploying robotaxis and robots, and increasing profits as measured by adjusted EBITDA. Proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) urged shareholders to vote against the plan. On October 17, ISS expressed concern over Elon Musk's split attention between his five businesses, which include Tesla and others such as Neuralink, SpaceX, the Boring Company, and xAI. Tesla denied ISS claims, with Elon Musk at the company's earnings call saying, “There needs to be enough voting control to give a strong influence, but not so much that I can’t be fired if I go insane.” Catch all the Business News , Corporate news , Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint.

Title: Why JioBlackRock’s quiet launch could shake up India’s investing future

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. Mumbai: When India’s largest company announced a big-bang joint venture (JV) with the world’s biggest asset manager to enter the country’s fast-growing mutual fund industry, it marked the coming together of two titans, and ratcheted up speculation to fever pitch. After all, this was in a sense the corporate equivalent of Sachin Tendulkar teaming up with Lionel Messi. The Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) is not known to play second fiddle in any industry it sets its sights on. And BlackRock, with assets under management of a staggering $11 trillion, is referred to as the third most important economic entity on the planet, behind only the US and China. This is BlackRock’s second innings in the Indian mutual fund arena, after its 10-year JV with DSP ended abruptly in 2018, reportedly after both partners sought full ownership of the business. After receiving all the requisite regulatory approvals by June, JioBlackRock Asset Management Company (AMC), the 50:50 JV between RIL subsidiary Jio Financial Services and BlackRock, commenced operations by launching three cash funds, followed by five index funds in August. The new fund offer (NFO) for its maiden actively managed equity product, a flexicap fund, closed earlier this month. Many industry watchers saw this as an uncharacteristically subdued start for a company with this pedigree. Initial impressions, however, have a tendency to be deceptive. In an interview with Mint, Sid Swaminathan, JioBlackRock AMC’s managing director and chief executive officer (CEO), was unambiguous about the company’s goals: “We want to be among the top five players in the industry over the next five years or so." Swaminathan smiled when asked about market expectations of the AMC making a high-voltage debut along the lines of Jio, which disrupted the telecom market in 2016 by launching zero tariff plans. His response was cautious: “The two are not comparable. These are two very different industries in terms of competition, regulations and customers." JioBlackRock, he said, had a clear cut approach: “First, growing the overall industry. Then bringing in differentiated products, differentiated value propositions and differentiated ways of getting people to access these products." Rather than one major disruption, Swaminathan said, “I would call it a series of micro disruptions. That’s how we have approached it." Whether a single earthquake or a series of tremors, one thing is beyond doubt: it would take something momentous to make a dent in India’s mutual fund market, which currently has 54 companies managing assets worth ₹75 trillion across around 2,000 schemes. It’s a tall task, but that’s where the American partner’s track record comes into the picture. Black boxJioBlackRock’s flexi cap fund marks the India debut of BlackRock’s Systematic Active Equities (SAE) framework. While this may sound awfully like just another marketing buzzword, it portends something much more significant. Systematic Active Equities is BlackRock’s famed quantitative investment unit, which uses advanced computer modelling techniques to construct portfolios. What sets it apart from most traditional quant models is that in addition to financial data, it analyses over 400 alternative data sources such as social media posts, internet searches, satellite imagery and even traffic patterns to squeeze out insights. BlackRock acquired SAE as part of its buyout of Barclays Global Investors in 2009 (the unit actually traces its roots to an investment firm set up by Wells Fargo in 1971). SAE now employs over 200 portfolio managers and researchers, many of whom are PhDs in various subjects, including physics, mathematics, computer science and engineering. The convergence of traditional and unstructured datasets has worked wonders for the SAE unit, which has assets under management of $300 billion across equities, fixed income and alternatives. An astounding 93% of SAE’s assets have outperformed their benchmarks or peer median over the past year, compared to 47% for the Fundamental Equity division, according to BlackRock’s Annual Report for 2024. Over the past three years, 89% of SAE assets have beaten the benchmark, while the figure rises to 93% for the five-year period. The Fundamental Equity division picks stocks using fundamental methods, i.e. human analysts and researchers. This SAE framework, being operated from BlackRock’s US headquarters and localised by the JV’s team in Mumbai, is now being applied to India’s chaotic equity market through the flexicap fund. “It’s a very risk controlled fund, so it will look to protect on the downside and then look to generate consistent alpha over the long term. If we are able to do that consistently over a two- to three-year period, which is what our backtests have shown us, then it is going to give you returns in line with the best ones up there," said Swaminathan, who has served in various leadership roles at BlackRock, including as its head of Index Equity, International, in London, where he oversaw assets worth $1.25 trillion. “And because of the way it is constructed, it looks, feels and behaves very differently to existing funds in the market." Explaining how the SAE framework can offer a competitive advantage, Swaminathan said, “Let’s say you are analyzing banks. You can obviously wait for the quarterly numbers. But you can also get faster information in some cases by looking at credit card swipes, for example. What’s the frequency of swipes, how is it trending compared to the sectoral averages and so on." The SAE framework, being operated from BlackRock’s US headquarters and localised by the JV’s team in Mumbai, is now being applied to India’s chaotic equity market through the flexicap fund. That intelligence, he says, enables one to form a more immediate-term view instead of waiting for the quarterly results. “And if we have a platform that is able to absorb all this data, clean that data and transform it into insights in combination with more traditional data points like valuations, profitability, PE ratio etc., then we believe there’s an opportunity to generate alpha." The other element is scale. A fund manager and his team can read and analyze a limited number of analyst reports, but a machine can read thousands of them. Thanks to artificial intelligence (AI), says Swaminathan, BlackRock is also able to generate things like tone and sentiment much more accurately from those reports. “So, you are no longer limited by human brain power capacity. If a traditional set-up using fund managers and analysts can do in-depth research on say 30-40 stocks, our models can do it for hundreds," he said. So, rather than taking concentrated positions in a handful of stocks, it enables smaller active positions on a larger universe of stocks, “which not only allows you to generate alpha but do it with lower risk". Global vs localThanks to the explosion of data in recent years, combined with the emergence of powerful tools such as artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), quant firms are engaged in an arms race with each other to extract even the tiniest additional insight. However, first-mover advantages dissipate very quickly in this cut-throat space and there’s nothing like a permanent magic wand. This makes it imperative for AMCs not just to keep hunting for new sets of data but also dynamically adjust their weightages and mathematical models in response to rapidly changing market conditions. The question is whether relying on this approach will work in a comparatively opaque market like India. “The good news is that there’s a lot of data being generated in every sector of the economy, so a data-driven approach can provide an edge in stock picking," Dhirendra Kumar, founder and CEO of Value Research, told Mint. “That said, just this cannot be your unique selling proposition. In fact, there are many quant models being used by domestic mutual funds and institutions that incorporate non-traditional datasets as well," he added. “So, BlackRock’s or anyone else’s models will have to prove themselves in the market over a sustained period." Then there is the question of adjusting for local nuances. In the US, for example, BlackRock tracks satellite imagery of car parks outside shopping centres to estimate demand, but that might not be relevant in India. Instead, the AMC uses quick commerce deliveries as one of its data signals. Swaminathan declined to share details about other datasets tracked by JioBlackRock, but said there’s an entire array of data points being collated though not all are relevant from a sector or stock perspective. In the US, BlackRock tracks satellite imagery of car parks outside shopping centres to estimate demand, but that might not be relevant in India. Instead, the AMC uses quick commerce deliveries as one of its data signals. Also making its India debut is Aladdin, BlackRock’s investment management and risk analytics platform. It stands for Asset, Liability, Debt and Derivative Investment Network. Aladdin has an India risk model built exclusively for the JV, which allows JioBlackRock’s fund managers to filter stock selections and assign appropriate weightages to data signals. But more than AI, ML and sophisticated quant models, Swaminathan insists SAE’s secret sauce for success is something else. “The key differentiator is that the technology, data, AI and humans are all integrated. Humans (fund managers and researchers) are involved in every aspect, from the first step of selecting the stock universe to subsequent processes of data analyses and insights," he said. The team, said Swaminathan, has the ability to look at the entire stock recommendation output of the models and filter out companies based on, say, corporate governance issues or other risk factors. “This is what separates SAE from other black box quant models," he emphasized. Last mileIndia’s mutual fund industry has emerged as one of the fastest-growing segments of the country’s financial landscape, with assets under management (AUM) surging more than seven-fold in just over a decade on the back of rising retail participation, mainly through systematic investment plans (SIPs). The industry is also very top-heavy, with 10 AMCs holding around 80% of the total AUM. With an AUM of over ₹11.4 trillion, SBI MF, established in 1987, is the country’s biggest asset manager, followed by ICICI Prudential AMC ( ₹9.5 trillion), HDFC AMC ( ₹8.3 trillion) and Nippon India MF ( ₹6.1 trillion). SBI MF reported a profit after tax (PAT) of ₹2,531 crore in FY25, while ICICI Prudential’s PAT was at ₹2,650 crore and HDFC AMC’s at ₹2,460 crore. On its part, JioBlackRock has racked up over ₹13,000 crore in AUM in barely three months. While that is creditable, the asset manager will be hard put to overtake SBI MF and ICICI Prudential organically the way its telecom cousin eased past Vodafone-Idea and Airtel. A conspicuous ‘micro-disruption’ has been JioBlackRock’s decision to take a digital-only approach and bypass the traditional distributor-led model used by the industry. The cost savings arising out of this, as well as use of Aladdin to construct and manage portfolios, has allowed it to offer the flexicap fund at an expense ratio (annual fee a mutual fund charges to cover its operating costs) of 0.50%, compared to the 0.60%-plus charged for similar direct funds by peers such as Parag Parikh, HDFC and ICICI Prudential. Swaminathan does not rule out physical distribution at some point down the line, but said the focus at the moment is to fully harness the “power of the phone". Bold and beautiful?The opportunity is huge, but so are the challenges. Sonam Srivastava, founder and fund manager at Wright Research PMS, said JioBlackRock’s digital-only approach is a bold experiment in a market where over 70% of mutual fund inflows still come through distributors. View Full Image In India, over 70% of mutual fund inflows are generated through distributors. (istockphoto) But it’s not entirely misplaced. India’s wealth ecosystem has changed sharply in the past five years—demat penetration has crossed 140 million, SIP accounts are rising by 20–25% annually, and over a third of new mutual fund investors are digital-first. This signals that a meaningful segment is now comfortable investing directly through platforms. However, distribution remains the backbone for scale and trust in the mutual fund industry, especially outside metros, where investor education and hand-holding are crucial. “JioBlackRock may find digital distribution efficient for cost control and urban adoption, but for deeper penetration and AUM scale, partnerships with RIAs (registered investment advisers), fintechs, or even traditional distributors might become inevitable," Srivastava added. “The future of distribution in India is hybrid, where digital channels drive discovery and onboarding, while advisors and distributors retain the role of building long-term conviction." It also helps to be part of the Jio family, which houses the country’s largest telecom operator, with 506 million subscribers as of 30 September. “We are already integrated within the Jio Finance app, which has millions of people coming every month to do their finances. We also have a presence in the MyJio app, which has hundreds of millions coming in every month for telco and other needs," said Swaminathan. In addition, the AMC has partnered with digital platforms like Paytm, Groww and Zerodha to distribute products. The early results have apparently been “more than encouraging". “We have over 630,000 investors across the life of this JV—in just a little over three months. But what’s even more encouraging to me is that more than 10% of those are first-time investors," said Swaminathan. “Our customer base already covers some 17,000 PIN codes, which is around 90% of the PIN codes in India. And we have only just begun," he added. We have over 630,000 investors across the life of this JV—in just a little over three months. —Sid Swaminathan Well begun may be half done, but the same does not always hold true for foreign asset managers in India. The list of global titans exiting the domestic mutual fund market is a long and distinguished one, and includes the likes of Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan, Deutsche Bank, and Goldman Sachs. Asked about this, Swaminathan said localised offerings and patience are crucial for success. BlackRock itself is taking a second swing at the Indian market, though Swaminathan insists the dynamics are completely different this time. The current joint venture is not between two asset managers. This is between BlackRock as the asset manager and Jio Financial Services, which brings in a deep understanding of the retail consumer along with digital distribution, he insisted. So, what are its near-term plans? Swaminathan said it would continue to have funds that cater to institutional investors as they are an important base for the AMC. “In retail, we want to have index as well as actively managed offerings," he said. Exchange traded funds and specialized investment funds are in the pipeline. For now, the market will be keenly tracking how JioBlackRock’s funds perform in the crowded space. As the JV’s foreign partner and its marquee peers will attest, it takes more than just a brand name to entice an Indian investor. Key Takeaways JioBlackRock, a JV between the financial services arm of RIL, India’s largest company, and BlackRock, the world’s biggest asset manager, is expected to shake up the MF industry In the three months since launch, JioBlackRock has racked up over ₹13,000 crore in assets under management JioBlackRock’s flexi cap fund marks the India debut of BlackRock’s Systematic Active Equities (SAE) framework SAE is BlackRock’s famed quantitative investment unit, which uses advanced computer modelling techniques to construct portfolios The framework analyses over 400 alternative data sources such as social media posts, internet searches, satellite imagery and even traffic patterns to squeeze out insights Experts say that while a data-driven approach can provide an edge in stock picking, it cannot be an AMC’s unique selling proposition.

If a traditional set-up using fund managers and analysts can do in-depth research on say 30-40 stocks, our models can do it for hundreds," he said. So, rather than taking concentrated positions in a handful of stocks, it enables smaller active positions on a larger universe of stocks, “which not only allows you to generate alpha but do it with lower risk". Global vs localThanks to the explosion of data in recent years, combined with the emergence of powerful tools such as artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), quant firms are engaged in an arms race with each other to extract even the tiniest additional insight. However, first-mover advantages dissipate very quickly in this cut-throat space and there’s nothing like a permanent magic wand. This makes it imperative for AMCs not just to keep hunting for new sets of data but also dynamically adjust their weightages and mathematical models in response to rapidly changing market conditions. The question is whether relying on this approach will work in a comparatively opaque market like India. “The good news is that there’s a lot of data being generated in every sector of the economy, so a data-driven approach can provide an edge in stock picking," Dhirendra Kumar, founder and CEO of Value Research, told Mint. “That said, just this cannot be your unique selling proposition. In fact, there are many quant models being used by domestic mutual funds and institutions that incorporate non-traditional datasets as well," he added. “So, BlackRock’s or anyone else’s models will have to prove themselves in the market over a sustained period." Then there is the question of adjusting for local nuances. In the US, for example, BlackRock tracks satellite imagery of car parks outside shopping centres to estimate demand, but that might not be relevant in India. Instead, the AMC uses quick commerce deliveries as one of its data signals. Swaminathan declined to share details about other datasets tracked by JioBlackRock, but said there’s an entire array of data points being collated though not all are relevant from a sector or stock perspective.

Instead, the AMC uses quick commerce deliveries as one of its data signals. Also making its India debut is Aladdin, BlackRock’s investment management and risk analytics platform. It stands for Asset, Liability, Debt and Derivative Investment Network. Aladdin has an India risk model built exclusively for the JV, which allows JioBlackRock’s fund managers to filter stock selections and assign appropriate weightages to data signals. But more than AI, ML and sophisticated quant models, Swaminathan insists SAE’s secret sauce for success is something else. “The key differentiator is that the technology, data, AI and humans are all integrated. Humans (fund managers and researchers) are involved in every aspect, from the first step of selecting the stock universe to subsequent processes of data analyses and insights," he said. The team, said Swaminathan, has the ability to look at the entire stock recommendation output of the models and filter out companies based on, say, corporate governance issues or other risk factors. “This is what separates SAE from other black box quant models," he emphasized. Last mileIndia’s mutual fund industry has emerged as one of the fastest-growing segments of the country’s financial landscape, with assets under management (AUM) surging more than seven-fold in just over a decade on the back of rising retail participation, mainly through systematic investment plans (SIPs). The industry is also very top-heavy, with 10 AMCs holding around 80% of the total AUM. With an AUM of over ₹11.4 trillion, SBI MF, established in 1987, is the country’s biggest asset manager, followed by ICICI Prudential AMC ( ₹9.5 trillion), HDFC AMC ( ₹8.3 trillion) and Nippon India MF ( ₹6.1 trillion). SBI MF reported a profit after tax (PAT) of ₹2,531 crore in FY25, while ICICI Prudential’s PAT was at ₹2,650 crore and HDFC AMC’s at ₹2,460 crore. On its part, JioBlackRock has racked up over ₹13,000 crore in AUM in barely three months. While that is creditable, the asset manager will be hard put to overtake SBI MF and ICICI Prudential organically the way its telecom cousin eased past Vodafone-Idea and Airtel. A conspicuous ‘micro-disruption’ has been JioBlackRock’s decision to take a digital-only approach and bypass the traditional distributor-led model used by the industry. The cost savings arising out of this, as well as use of Aladdin to construct and manage portfolios, has allowed it to offer the flexicap fund at an expense ratio (annual fee a mutual fund charges to cover its operating costs) of 0.50%, compared to the 0.60%-plus charged for similar direct funds by peers such as Parag Parikh, HDFC and ICICI Prudential.

Title: Tokenized Credit Fund: BNY Mellon Expands into CLOs
URL: https://beincrypto.com/tokenized-credit-fund-bny-mellon-expands-into-clos/
Time Published: 2025-10-30T08:04:02Z
Full Content:
Written byShigeki Mori Edited byOihyun Kim BNY Mellon is expanding its blockchain-based asset tokenization strategy by launching a collateralized loan obligation fund. This marks the latest step in the custody bank’s measured approach to bringing traditional financial products on-chain. The Securitize Tokenized AAA CLO Fund, announced on Wednesday, will provide institutional investors access to AAA-rated floating-rate collateralized loan obligations on the Ethereum network. BNY will serve as custodian while its subsidiary, Insight Investment, handles portfolio management. BNY Mellon’s approach reflects a deliberate sequencing strategy adopted by several large financial institutions entering the tokenization space. The bank partnered with Goldman Sachs three months ago to launch tokenized money market funds on Goldman’s Digital Asset Platform. This enabled institutional clients to hold blockchain-based representations of fund shares from BlackRock, Fidelity, and other asset managers. The move revealed a methodical progression from simpler to more complex instruments. Securitize announced the launch as “the first tokenized fund focused on AAA-rated CLOs, bringing institutional-grade structured credit onchain.” 6/ With over $1 trillion in global CLO issuance, this fund represents a new way for institutional credit to move onchain, reducing onboarding friction while enabling faster, programmable access. Money market funds represent a relatively straightforward tokenization use case. Their underlying assets are liquid, standardized, and subject to well-established regulatory frameworks, making them a logical entry point for institutions testing blockchain infrastructure. Collateralized loan obligations present additional complexity. CLOs bundle corporate loans into tranches with varying risk profiles. They require sophisticated monitoring of loan performance, cash flow structures, and credit quality metrics. The $1.3 trillion global CLO market involves multiple parties, including originators, servicers, trustees, and rating agencies. Each requires coordination and data access. By moving from money market funds to CLOs, BNY demonstrates confidence in managing more intricate tokenized structures. The bank maintains institutional custody and compliance standards expected by regulators and investors. Traditional financial institutions face distinct challenges when implementing blockchain technology compared to crypto-native firms. Legacy systems must integrate with new infrastructure. Regulatory frameworks designed for conventional markets must be adapted. Institutional clients require the same security standards they expect from traditional products. BNY’s structured credit tokenization approach addresses these concerns through controlled expansion. The bank maintains traditional recordkeeping systems alongside blockchain-based tokens, ensuring continuity if technical issues arise. Custody arrangements remain under established legal frameworks, providing institutional investors with familiar protections. Settlement occurs through permissioned networks rather than fully public blockchains, allowing for oversight and intervention if necessary. This approach allows banks to capture efficiency benefits—faster settlement, reduced reconciliation costs, and programmable features—while maintaining risk controls. Smart contracts can automate cash flows and corporate actions, but ultimate authority remains with regulated custodians. The model contrasts with rapid experimentation, which is common in decentralized finance. Protocols there launch with minimal barriers but face heightened security and regulatory risks. The CLO fund launch positions BNY within a broader competitive landscape around institutional tokenization. Goldman Sachs plans to eventually spin off its Digital Asset Platform as an industry-owned infrastructure. Citigroup has established itself as a tokenization agent and custodian on Switzerland’s SDX exchange. BlackRock’s tokenized Treasury fund has grown significantly across crypto-linked products. Prominent asset managers and custody banks are converging on similar tokenized credit strategies. They begin with liquid, standardized instruments, develop operational expertise, and then expand to more complex products. Carlos Domingo, chief executive of Securitize, which has issued $4.5 billion in tokenized assets, characterized the CLO fund as a step toward making high-quality credit more accessible. The company announced plans to merge with Cantor Equity Partners II at a $1.25 billion valuation this week. The news are out! @Securitize has filed to go public in Nasdaq via a merger with Cantor Equity Partners II lead by @Brandonlutnick at a $1.25B valuation 🦄🦄🦄 Boston Consulting Group and Ripple estimated the tokenized real-world asset market could reach $18.9 trillion by 2033, up from approximately $35 billion currently. However, significant challenges remain, including cross-border regulatory coordination, evolving legal frameworks, and operational risks. These include network congestion and key management security. The measured pace of institutional adoption reflects these realities. Banks pursue targeted use cases where blockchain provides clear advantages while risks remain manageable.

Image Source: Land O Lakes Co. – Flickr – Public Domain Land O’ Lakes dairy cooperative was founded in 1921 in St. Paul Minnesota by 320 small cooperative creameries. They hoped to improve the quality of butter produced in Minnesota as well as implement better marketing practices thereby improving the profitability of dairy farmers. That’s always been the goal of farmer cooperatives, by working together, groups of small farmers can get better prices for what they sell and pay lower prices for the inputs they have to buy. That was the theory, part of the cooperative thinking that made rural America a better place. Farmer cooperatives were supportive of parity pricing, introduced in Roosevelt’s 1933 Agriculture Adjustment Act– the first Farm Bill, that ensured farmers a fair price. In their early years, cooperatives truly had the best interests of their farmer members at heart. But as some cooperatives grew into national powerhouses and many small local cooperatives went out of business, farmers felt the big cooperatives looked more like corporations than the small cooperative cheese factories or local feed mills that they grew up with, growth seemed more important than the collective good of the farmers. In a recent piece in Time magazine Land O’ Lakes CEO Beth Ford voiced her concern at the continuing loss of farmers, low commodity prices and declining farm income which dropped 25% from 2022 to 2024. Estimates put median farm income for 2025 at -$328. It’s not a new phenomenon, according to USDA data, the average US dairy farm turned a profit twice between 2000 and 2021. She mentions that farmers are getting older, with more farmers over the age of 75 than under the age of 35— no wonder, not many 20 or 30 somethings would take a job knowing they would probably be working for a negative income while slowly loosing their equity. Still, kudos to Beth Ford for at least pointing out some of the problems farmers have always faced, —basically an up and down cycle of good years and bad, with luck, enough good years to keep going, but never enough good years to be consistently profitable. But, there is more to the story of Land O’ Lakes. Most agribusiness CEO’s (while collecting their seven figure salaries) and their well compensated boards of directors, move their business model towards more growth and advise farmers to adopt more “efficient farming practices” meaning a shift to fewer, but larger farms that can afford the capital investments required to stay in business as markets, credit and infrastructure favor growth. So, while lamenting the loss of so many farms and farmers, Land O’ Lakes, through their own business model of consolidation has promoted this trend. “As agricultural markets consolidate, competition lessens, meaning producers and consumers have fewer options”. “Milk producers historically organized into co-ops to counterbalance concentrated power among buyers, but today, the largest co-ops, such as Dairy Farmers of America and Land O’ Lakes, prey off of small-scale producers they’re supposed to protect and strike arrangements with massive milk processors, like Dean Foods, that result in additional wealth transfers from farmers to their own executives”. While farm income has continued to drop, one of Ms. Ford’s solutions, —robust trade, apparently hasn’t raised farm incomes either. The US has promoted liberalized international trade of agricultural commodities for over 50 years, and even more aggressively since the 1996 farm bill that wanted to “get the government out of the marketplace”, yet farmers still can’t make a living and “get big or get out” is accepted as inevitable. Despite their squashing of competition in the domestic dairy sector, Land O’ Lakes has established a “strategic partnership” with the worlds largest dairy exporter, New Zealand based Fonterra. Apparently importing New Zealand cream cheese, non-dairy butter spread etc, will help US dairy farmers? Cooperatives are supposed to work for the best interests of their farmer owners, so it’s also unclear why a CEO and the cooperative board would think that engaging in illegal activities would be in the best interests the cooperative in general, specifically, its farmers. Yet they did, resulting in the price-fixing lawsuits and the ensuing settlements in dairy and in poultry for a total of $297 million. I doubt the farmer owners voted to enter into these scandals, but they paid for them. So, as mentioned, when cooperatives get too big, they often begin to act like a corporation, not a cooperative. Ms. Ford finally notes that “As private equity firms have become financial buyers of farmland, consolidation trends are changing. In Iowa alone, 20 million of its 30 million acres of farmland are set to transition. When farms are owned by firms, not families, communities wither. Contract farming does not plant community roots”. An odd comment for someone who has held a seat on the Board of Directors of BlackRock, an investment firm with considerable holdings in US farmland, agribusiness corporations and recently in Ukrainian farmland. While she stated that she was “honored to join this impactful organization” her resignation a year later, “was not a result of any disagreement with the Company, the Company’s management or the Board”, — so, she was part of their investment strategy and apparently did not disagree with it. Money and power can corrupt and cooperatives, can become that which they sought to oppose. Jim Goodman is a dairy farmer from Wonewoc, Wisconsin.

Stablecoin leader Circle, the issuer of USDC, has officially launched its Arc testnet with VISA, Mastercard and other major partners, a new Layer-1 blockchain designed to serve as the “economic operating system for the internet.” Related Reading: Solana Price Set For Double-Digit Rally Above $230: Analyst Reveals How To Spot Next Move The testnet already counts over 100 major participants from finance, technology, and payments, including, as mentioned, Visa, Mastercard, BlackRock, Goldman Sachs, and Coinbase, all collaborating to bridge the gap between TradFi and the on-chain economy. Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire described Arc as purpose-built to connect every local market to the global economy, emphasizing its ability to facilitate lending, capital markets, foreign exchange, and global payments. Arc’s design centers on USDC as the native gas token, offering predictable dollar-based transaction fees and sub-second finality, features that make it uniquely appealing for regulated financial operations. Arc’s debut underscores a growing institutional appetite for blockchain infrastructure that balances regulatory compliance with decentralized programmability. Participants such as Apollo, BNY Mellon, and State Street join payment titans and fintech leaders in testing Arc’s capabilities. Circle has also enlisted developer partners like Alchemy, Chainlink, and Anthropic, while Coinbase and Uniswap are providing liquidity support. The network integrates optional privacy controls to ensure compliance with data-protection standards while enabling transparency for audits and settlements. This balance is crucial for large financial institutions exploring tokenized assets, real-time settlements, and programmable payments. In a significant regional development, South Korean firm BDACS announced it will issue its Korean won-backed stablecoin (KRW1) on Circle’s Arc blockchain, a move aimed at expanding South Korea’s regulated stablecoin presence on the global stage. While Circle currently oversees Arc’s testnet operations, the company plans to transition toward community-governed decentralization in the future. Compliance partners like Elliptic are already integrating monitoring tools to strengthen transparency across the ecosystem. Industry analysts view Arc as Circle’s most ambitious project yet, a move that could reshape how banks, fintechs, and enterprises conduct cross-border payments and tokenized finance.

October 29, 2025 23:00 ET | Source: Aqua Labs Investment LLC Aqua Labs Investment LLC With $20 Million Global Startup Program And Summit Leadership in Dubai DUBAI, United Arab Emirates, Oct. 30, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Aqua Labs, the emerging UAE-based Web3 investment group, has reinforced its commitment to the nation’s Economic Vision 2030 through its leadership role at the Vision 2030: Global Digital Economy and Brand Excellence Summit. The event was held from 23 to 28 October 2025, at Palazzo Versace in Dubai. Organised by MOVA, the next-generation modular blockchain for global payments, and Minax, the real-world asset (RWA) platform, the summit celebrated the convergence of technology, art, and enterprise in driving the next phase of global economic transformation. The event convened senior representatives from the UAE Ministry of Economy & Tourism, the World Bank, the Private Office of His Highness Sheikh Hamdan Bin Ahmed Al Maktoum, Bithumb and Palm Promax Investment, alongside leading investors and innovators. Speakers included Dr Peter Knez, former Chief Investment Officer of BlackRock; Dr Sara Al Mashjari; Representatives of the Promotion and Investment Center for Burkina Faso and Partners (CPIB) in the UAE; Board Members of Promax Group; and representatives from the UN headquarters of AACID - ECOSOC UN; Wael Muhalsen, CEO of MOVA; and Bobby Zhou, Founding Partner of Aqua Labs. The participation of Aqua Labs, an innovative new player, at the summit followed the recent launch of its $20 million Startup Support Program. The program was unveiled in October 2025 in Abu Dhabi and invites founders worldwide to apply for funding, mentorship, and access to Web3 infrastructure designed to accelerate real-world adoption of blockchain, AI, and digital finance technologies. The program also underscores Aqua Labs’ nascent mission to empower visionary entrepreneurs and position the UAE as a global launchpad for next-generation innovation. At the summit, Bobby Zhou, Founding Partner of Aqua Labs, said: “We are honored to have supported the Vision 2030: Global Digital Economy & Brand Excellence Summit and to have given the opening address. Vision 2030 is a celebration of the convergence of technology, art, and real-world assets. We brought together visionary leaders, pioneering brands, and innovators with a shared goal: to transform traditional industries through blockchain-powered infrastructure and global asset tokenization. “Too often, when people hear the word ‘blockchain,’ they think of volatility, speculation, or fringe technologies. That perception is outdated. Blockchain represents excellence and virtue, a framework for trust in the digital world. By embracing it, we can reimagine industries, unlock new creative potential, and enable real-world value to flow seamlessly across borders. We are not just imagining the future, we are creating it.” Aqua Labs Investment LLC recently launched in Abu Dhabi as a licensed entity under the Department of Economic Development, serving as the operational arm of the Aqua1 Foundation. Its next-generation mandate is to develop infrastructure for real-world asset tokenization, AI-powered financial systems, and compliant blockchain ecosystems that connect sovereign and institutional capital with digital finance innovation. Through partnerships with sovereign wealth funds, institutional investors, and global technology leaders, Aqua Labs is building a transparent and scalable framework for the next generation of financial systems – one capable of bringing trillions in real-world assets on-chain while fostering liquidity, resilience, and inclusion across markets.

Title: Tether now holds $135B in U.S. debt – Bigger than South Korea!

Time Published: 2025-10-29T22:00:58Z
Full Content:
Tether backs USDT with $135B in Treasuries, becoming a major player in global liquidity markets. It prompted Tether to launch USA₮, a compliant dollar-backed token tailored for U.S. regulations. Yes, but USDC is gaining ground in transaction volume and institutional adoption. The rise of stablecoins is increasingly being felt beyond the digital asset market. Tether’s USDT, the world’s largest stablecoin, now backs its token supply with approximately $135 billion in U.S. Treasury bills, according to recent disclosures. That figure makes Tether the 17th largest U.S. debt holder globally, surpassing countries such as South Korea and nearing Brazil, as noted by Tether’s CEO Paolo Ardoino. The development underscores how dollar-pegged crypto assets have evolved into meaningful participants in global liquidity flows, particularly in the short-term bond market. This comes at a time when the stablecoin market is entering a new regulatory and competitive phase, especially after U.S. President Donald Trump signed the GENIUS Act, establishing a clearer regulatory path for compliant stablecoins in the U.S. market. In response, Tether introduced USA₮, a dollar-backed token specifically designed to meet the new U.S. regulatory requirements. Rival issuer Circle, meanwhile, has been expanding partnerships and infrastructure placements, and overseas players like Japan’s JPYC are also scaling operations to tap into rising global stablecoin demand. At the transaction level, stablecoin usage remains massive. Visa’s on-chain analytics further show that stablecoins facilitated $6.4 trillion in total transfers over the past 30 days. While USDT typically leads market activity, October data illustrate a competitive shift. This is because USDC recorded approximately $669.15 billion in monthly transaction volume, slightly ahead of USDT’s $607.98 billion during the same period. The figures suggest that while USDT still dominates overall market share and circulation, USDC is gaining meaningful traction in payments and institutional pipelines. At the same time, Tether is expanding beyond stablecoins altogether. Tether Data, the company’s technology unit, recently announced the launch of QVAC Genesis I, a 41-billion-token synthetic dataset built to train science- and engineering-focused AI models. Alongside it, the firm introduced QVAC Workbench, an application that allows users to run AI models directly on local devices. However, AMBCrypto’s analysis shows USDT still leads the market with a 79% share in August 2025, but its dominance is slowly slipping as USDC gains ground. While USDC offers stronger transparency and fully liquid reserves overseen by BlackRock, USDT’s mix of assets, ranging from Treasuries to Bitcoin and commodities, raises more debate. However, the 10th October flash de-peg proved that stability isn’t just about reserve composition. This is because USDT briefly traded above $1 while USDC dipped, highlighting that trust in stablecoins now depends as much on real-world performance as the assets backing them.

Title: In Congress, Former State Treasurers Aim to Manage Budget Better

Riley Moore, R-W.Va. (Samuel Corum/Getty Images) George Caldwell / @GCaldwell_news George Caldwell is a journalism fellow at The Daily Signal. Send an email to George. Members of Congress come from all walks of life, but a number of those lawmakers have backgrounds as state financial officers—auditors and treasurers, who determine how states invest and employ their funds. Some prominent Republicans say that background of conservative money management has made them uniquely motivated to curtail Congress’ spending. On Wednesday, the State Financial Officers Foundation, a network of conservative state financial officers, gathered for a panel discussion in Washington to discuss how alumni are applying their experience on the state level toward fiscally conservative legislation in Congress. Rep. Riley Moore is a freshman in the House, but is already in a place of prominence as a member of the Appropriations Committee, which makes decisions on federal spending. Moore, a nephew of Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., told The Daily Signal that he draws on his experience as state treasurer of West Virginia in his work. “It was hugely beneficial to me when I was making my case to get on Appropriations. I’m the only freshman Republican or Democrat on Appropriations,” he told The Daily Signal. “Had I not had that state financial officer’s background, I’m not sure I’d be on that committee.” During his tenure as treasurer, Moore pursued pro-natural gas policies, such as divesting state pension funds from BlackRock for its use of environmental, social, and governance criteria in making investments. West Virginia’s economy has historically relied on coal and natural gas. He also worked with state legislators on passing legislation to blacklist financial institutions from doing business with the West Virginia government “if their policies conflicted with or boycotted the energy industry.” In Congress, Moore has left his mark on the ongoing appropriations process in a similar way, introducing an amendment into the House’s financial services funding bill to clamp down on credit-rating agencies using ESG criteria, a policy he says has negatively affected his state’s bond rating. As West Virginia’s State Treasurer, I was the first elected official in America to divest my state’s tax dollars from BlackRock that leveraged ESG policies to destroy the fossil fuel industries of my state.Today, my amendment ensures that rating agencies cannot use ESG to… pic.twitter.com/BgXR4PXLbH His amendment would require the Securities and Exchange Commission to report on which agencies use ESG criteria in order to assist Congress in addressing the negative effects on states’ finances. Moore also comes from a state that, like many others, has a balanced-budget amendment, meaning the state legislature has to make tough decisions on funding each year, and the state treasurer works within the parameters of those budgets. He says that drives him toward a fiscally conservative approach. “At a state level, obviously we’re always doing more with less. That’s what we do. Right here [in Washington], it’s kind of the opposite,” he said. “I think being able to bring that perspective to the appropriation process is certainly something that’s beneficial, not just to the committee, but I think the country as a whole.” Rep. Jimmy Patronis similarly said it has been a culture shock coming from Florida, which has a balanced-budget amendment, to Congress, which has not passed a balanced budget in a quarter of a century. Patronis was the chief financial officer of Florida before being elected to Congress in a special election to fill the seat vacated by former Rep. Matt Gaetz. “The states have been able to be more disciplined, but it’s taken constitutional amendments in those states in order to force some of those policies to be the law of the land,” Patronis told The Daily Signal. “Could we do that in Washington? It’s hard. One thing I’ve learned in Washington: People do enjoy spending money, and I come from a background being a small-business person, where I’m always trying to find ways to create profit, not to spend money,” Patronis said, adding: I’m grateful for what I’ve brought up here to Washington, what I’ve learned, and just hopefully, we can find enough like minds where we can move the needle. One of the most prominent alumni of the State Financial Officers Foundation is Rep. Ron Estes. Estes serves on the House Ways and Means Committee, where all bills related to taxation originate. He points to his time as Kansas state treasurer, working with limited resources, as a valuable experience. “I think a lot of what you look at, just from a standpoint of what’s the role of government, you look at small, limited government and being able to provide people the opportunity to do what they want to without government dictating what to do,” Estes told The Daily Signal of his experience as state treasurer. He added, “There are some functions and features that a government should do, but let’s make sure that they’re efficient and effective in terms of how we set up them up, how we make them work, how we make them apply to people.” The State Financial Officers Foundation is led by Marlo Oaks, the Utah state treasurer. Oaks told The Daily Signal that he continues to value the connections between the organization and its alumni on Capitol Hill. “It’s really nice to have folks that have been in this role who understand what we’re doing at the state now at the federal level,” said Oaks. But he added that, despite the important action in Washington, officials on the state level play a major role themselves in determining governance. “They’ve clearly played a very significant role during the Biden administration, pushing back against the whole-of-government approach. That was one of the greatest over-exercisings of power in the history of this country … to push an agenda on this country.” Today, even with President Trump’s victory, leftist elites have their tentacles in every aspect of our government. The Daily Signal’s own Tyler O’Neil exposes this leftist cabal in his new book, The Woketopus: The Dark Money Cabal Manipulating the Federal Government. In this book, O’Neil reveals how the Left’s NGO apparatus pursues its woke agenda, maneuvering like an octopus by circumventing Congress and entrenching its interests in the federal government.

Title: Northland butchers scoop sausage awards as steak prices bite

The team at Coopers Beach Butchery were the only Northland butchers to take out an overall category prize at this year's Dunninghams Great NZ Sausage Competition. Hand-crafted sausages are smoking past pricey steak as the barbecue go-to this summer – and Northland’s butchers are producing some of the best in the business. The Northern Advocate recently highlighted Omak Meats’ silver medal in the pork category of the 2025 Dunningham’s Great New Zealand Sausage Competition, but has since caught wind that several other Northland butchers also earned top honours. Mangawhai Meat Shop – also known as Klink’s Family Deli – earned two golds for its Free-range Pork and Fennel and Bolognese with Parmesan sausages, and a silver for its Chicken Carbonara. The wins bring the shop’s overall medal tally to 23, including a previous Supreme Award, over the 13 years it’s been entering the national competition. Owner Dan Klink said he was proud that a regional shop with a staff of only five could do so well in a competition that also drew entries from the country’s biggest players. “With over 800 entries from over 110 stores around New Zealand, it’s getting harder and harder to stand out from the rest, but my team and I keep focusing on quality and innovation.” He said sausages were fast becoming the new barbecue staple as meat prices soar. The butchers agreed that beef and lamb prices had increased at least 30% in the past year alone. “People are looking for value, and sausages offer that. They’re more affordable than steak, but when they’re handcrafted like ours, they’re still packed with flavour and quality.” Klink said there might even be a special Christmas snag in the works, possibly incorporating a cranberry and bacon stuffing that the store also sells. Coopers Beach Butchery was the only overall Category Champions in Northland, winning the highest accolade in the pork section – the same category in which Omak Meats won silver. Coopers Beach butcher Gavin Cameron said it was his first time entering the competition since taking ownership of the shop five years ago. However, his winning Blackrock Pork Sausage - named after his previous Auckland business - was the same recipe for which he’d won the Supreme Award back in 2007. “It’s a nod to where we came from and what we’ve built since,” Cameron said. “We’re proud of what we do, and it’s great to see Northland butchers getting the recognition they deserve.” Cameron said the value of a local butcher went far beyond the impersonal experiences of supermarket shopping or a meal kit designed by someone else. “We talk to our customers, we know what they like, and we can help them make the most of what they’re buying,” he said. Butchers could help customers plan a whole meal, still offered cuts supermarkets had long since dropped, and could custom-make products to order. This year was the toughest economically for the industry and for customers, Cameron said. A good sausage was like having a good steak, and at just over $20 kg, the price of two was usually between $5 to $6 - much more affordable than a piece of steak, Cameron said. “And, if the sausage is an award-winning one, handcrafted, you’re going to really taste the difference between it and a massively processed one," he said. Cameron also tied for a bronze medal with Webster Family Butchery in Dargaville, both being recognised for their Roast Lamb and Caramelised Onion recipe. The Dargaville business’s working-owner Kyle Webster, said sausage sales had surged since he reopened the butcher shop about four years ago. “Our sausage sales have increased, probably 50% since we started here, because they’re still affordable when steak and lamb are so expensive.” Webster said he was developing a Wild West Kumara sausage – a mix of beef, spices and kumara – which sells out weekly. While it wasn’t a placegetter in this year’s competition, Webster believed he was on to a future winner. “The problem is we’re so busy here making sausages, we don’t get enough time to actually, you know, tweak and test and add – but I’m going to make time next year," he said. Sarah Curtis is a news reporter for the Northern Advocate, focusing on a wide range of issues. She has nearly 20 years’ experience in journalism, most of which she spent court reporting in Gisborne and on the East Coast. ‘You’re going to lose the heart of NorthTec’: Staff fear support stripped back.

Title: Markets Tumble After Fed Lowers Interest Rates—But Powell Won’t Promise Another Cut

ByTy Roush, Forbes Staff. The Federal Reserve on Wednesday voted to lower interest rates for the second straight month, but the broader market reacted negatively after Fed Chair Jerome Powell suggested an additional cut may not come later this year. The Federal Open Market Committee voted 10-2 in favor of easing interest rates by a quarter-point to between 3.75% and 4%, down from the 4% to 4.25% range policymakers opted for during the FOMC’s meeting last month. Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid and Fed Governor Stephen Miran were the lone dissenting votes: Miran again pushed for a half-point reduction after dissenting in September’s vote, while Schmid preferred the Fed not lower rates at all. In its statement, the FOMC held its review of the labor market, which notes that “job gains have slowed and the unemployment rate has edged up but remained low through August.” The Fed appeared to acknowledge the ongoing federal government shutdown, adding “available indicators” suggest the U.S. economy has expanded at a moderate pace and that inflation has “moved up since earlier in the year and remains somewhat elevated.” Fed Chair Jerome Powell said in a statement that policymakers had “strongly differing views” about how to proceed in the FOMC’s last meeting in December. A further reduction to interest rates is “not a foregone conclusion,” Powell said, “Far from it.” Powell noted that while some government data has been delayed, public and private sector data that have remained available suggest employment and inflation have “not changed much” since the FOMC met last month. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (down 0.2%) and S&P 500 (0.3%) dropped on the day after Powell’s statements, paring back earlier gains on the day largely driven by Nvidia’s record-setting surge, which has held up the tech-heavy Nasdaq (up 0.1%) so far. Boeing (4.3%) headlined declines across the Dow, followed by Nike (3.1%), UnitedHealth Group (3%) and Home Depot (2%). Investors are favoring an additional quarter-point reduction to interest rates at the FOMC’s last meeting in December, potentially lowering rates to between 3.5% and 3.75%, according to CME’s FedWatch tool. In its meeting last month, Fed officials appeared to be divided over whether to cut rates for a third time this year. It’s unclear when the Fed will have insight into the U.S. economy’s health, however, as an ongoing federal government shutdown has postponed reports on inflation and unemployment. In a speech to the Council on Foreign Relations earlier this month, Fed Governor Christopher Waller said he supported the FOMC’s decision to ease monetary policy, indicating his focus had shifted to a “softening” labor market instead of inflation. Waller said that, because policymakers “don’t know which way the data will break on this conflict,” the FOMC would “need to move with care” when adjusting interest rates. Waller noted he has spoken with “business contacts” to form his outlook on the economy while a data blackout continues.

Title: Federal Reserve Lowers Interest Rates Again

ByTy Roush, Forbes Staff. The Federal Reserve on Wednesday voted to lower interest rates again, the second straight month the central bank eased monetary policy after months of pressure and criticism from President Donald Trump, who has called for steeper cuts. The Federal Open Market Committee voted 10-2 in favor of easing interest rates by a quarter-point to between 3.75% and 4%, down from the 4% to 4.25% range policymakers opted for during the FOMC’s meeting last month. Investors are favoring an additional quarter-point reduction to interest rates at the FOMC’s last meeting in December, potentially lowering rates to between 3.5% and 3.75%, according to CME’s FedWatch tool. In its meeting last month, Fed officials appeared to be divided over whether to cut rates for a third time this year. It’s unclear when the Fed will have insight into the U.S. economy’s health, however, as an ongoing federal government shutdown has postponed reports on inflation and unemployment. In a speech to the Council on Foreign Relations earlier this month, Fed Governor Christopher Waller said he supported the FOMC’s decision to ease monetary policy, indicating his focus had shifted to a “softening” labor market instead of inflation. Waller said that, because policymakers “don’t know which way the data will break on this conflict,” the FOMC would “need to move with care” when adjusting interest rates. Waller noted he has spoken with “business contacts” to form his outlook on the economy while a data blackout continues. Reports released from several firms and economists in recent weeks suggest the labor market has continued to deteriorate, suggesting the FOMC could have data to support an additional cut. Whether Trump names his pick to succeed Fed Chair Jerome Powell, whose term expires in May 2026, by the end of the year.

Title: Ethereum Foundation rolls out new institution-focused site amid Wall Street’s crypto push

About us Copy link Wall Street is embracing crypto like never before. But financial institutions may struggle to know where to begin. The Ethereum Foundation is aiming to make this easier for them with the launch of a new website. On Wednesday, the organisation, which helps develop and maintain the Ethereum blockchain, launched the new online resource to help guide firms looking to integrate the blockchain into their businesses. “Clear pathways are essential as institutions build on Ethereum,” a post from the foundation said, adding that the site will help guide businesses adopting Ethereum and showcase how the ecosystem is building a new financial system. 1/ Now live: the Ethereum for Institutions siteEthereum is the neutral, secure base layer where the world's financial value is coming onchainToday, we’re launching a new site for the builders, leaders, and institutions advancing this global movement pic.twitter.com/KGNKVaPda0 1/ Now live: the Ethereum for Institutions siteEthereum is the neutral, secure base layer where the world's financial value is coming onchainToday, we’re launching a new site for the builders, leaders, and institutions advancing this global movement pic.twitter.com/KGNKVaPda0 The site highlights institutional use cases for Ethereum, including stablecoins, the tokenisation of real-world assets like bonds, and decentralised financial applications. It also contains statistics on the blockchain’s use, and information on firms like BlackRock, Visa, and eToro, who are already experimenting with Ethereum. Ethereum is the biggest blockchain for DeFi, with some $118 billion worth of deposits to more than one thousand protocols. It also hosts more than half of the $308 billion stablecoin market. But the blockchain’s stewards — namely the nonprofit Ethereum Foundation — have previously faced criticism for not doing enough to support institutional adoption on the blockchain compared to its rivals. The move comes amid a crypto land grab among the paragons of traditional finance who are looking to leverage blockchain technology following landmark legislation being approved this summer. On Tuesday, banking giant Citi announced a partnership with US crypto exchange Coinbase to foster the adoption of stablecoins. The firms plan to build stablecoin on- and off-ramps, streamline settlement, and make digital dollars flow 24/7. Over the past week, Zelle and Western Union have also revealed plans to integrate stablecoins into their operations. Seeing the growing institutional interest, the Ethereum Foundation has sought to make the blockchain more attractive for financial firms looking to integrate the technology. Last year, the foundation, along with Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, funded research into Wall Street’s interest in Ethereum through Etherealize, a startup focused on integrating traditional finance with the blockchain. “Institutions need someone to be the face of the organisation that is representing Ethereum,” Tomasz Stańczak, one of the Ethereum Foundation’s co-directors, told DL News in July. Etherealize has bold plans for adoption. In September, CEO Vivek Raman told DL News of his ambition to onboard the $16 trillion mortgage market to Ethereum. “The whole fixed income space of really esoteric objects, such as mortgages, is a huge design space to tokenise those natively,” Raman said. In addition to courting institutions, representatives from Etherealize met with the Securities and Exchange Commission’s crypto task force in May to discuss how the regulator could accommodate tokenisation of stocks and bonds on the blockchain.

Title: Family speak of their horror as two men jailed for Kieran Quilligan murder in Cork

A man whose son was beaten to death before his body was dumped in a woodland has said the murderers did not show “one bit of remorse for what they did” despite listening to “horror stories” in court during their trial. The family of Kieran Quilligan (47) delivered victim impact statements at the Central Criminal Court in Cork on Wednesday as Niall Long (33) and Luke Taylor (28) were sentenced to life imprisonment by Ms Justice Siobhán Lankford. Long, formerly of St Michael’s Close, Mahon, Cork, and Taylor, formerly of Cherry Lawn, Blackrock, Cork, pleaded not guilty to murdering Mr Quilligan on a date unknown between September 1st, 2023 and January 29th, 2024. However, a jury found them both guilty of murder. Mr Quilligan’s mother, Catherine O’Flynn, his father Stephen Quilligan, and his partner, Colette O’Driscoll, on Wednesday told the court how Mr Quilligan’s death had affected them. Ms O’Flynn said the family clung on to the hope that Kieran was still alive after he disappeared from his flat in Cork city on September 1st, 2023, and that it was all just a bad dream from which they would one day wake up. “I remember the months unfolding. How could I forget? Each day the weather conditions were getting worse – it felt like there were never so many storms. I’d stare out the windows thinking ‘God love him – he is out there in all this’, while still clinging to the hope he was still alive," she said. “We were living in a world of loss, fear and hope until January 29th, 2024 when Kieran’s skeletal remains were found. Our hearts were broken in a million pieces – our worst nightmare come true,” added Ms O’Flynn, who said that if her love could have saved her son, he would still be alive. Stephen Quilligan said they knew foul play had been involved in Kieran’s disappearance, but it was not until they sat through the murder trial and heard the evidence that they realised the full horror of what had happened. “We were shocked, angry, in disbelief that someone could do this to another person and pretend like nothing happened,” he said. “For the last three weeks we have sat here listening to horror stories about my son and the two defendants didn’t show one bit of remorse for what they did.” He thanked An Garda Síochána for not giving up when searching for Kieran and treating him “like a human being”. Ms O’Driscoll said she adored Kieran and they had been told before his disappearance that they were to be housed together. “Kieran was going to get the keys to his long-awaited castle,” she said. Det Garda Ann O’Sullivan outlined the background to the murder. She said Long and Taylor killed Mr Quilligan in retaliation for an incident earlier on September 1st, 2023 when Mr Quilligan and another man had robbed Long of drugs and cash in Cork city centre. The three men were known to each other as they were users of heroin and crack cocaine. Taylor lured Mr Quilligan from his flat on Anderson’s Quay to St Finbarr’s Place, where he was attacked by him and Long before being bundled into the boot of a Toyota Rav 4. Gardaí were able to link the vehicle to Long and tracked it driving to the Little Island area, where they dumped Mr Quilligan’s body off a farmyard. Gardaí tracked the vehicle returning there three days later, when the defendants collected and moved Mr Quilligan’s body. Garda were able to track the vehicle’s movements to Whitewell, Rostellan near Midleton. A search of the area by a cadaver dog on January 29th, 2024 led them to Mr Quilligan’s skeletal remains, which had been dumped in a gravel bag in low lying forestry. Det Garda O’Sullivan said Assistant State Pathologist Dr Margot Bolster was unable to give a cause of death because of the long interval between Mr Quilligan’s death and the postmortem. She testified that many of Mr Quilligan’s fractures were “suggestive of a blow with a blunt instrument like a hammer and there is no doubt at all they are consistent with a severe and significant assault”.

TWO MEN HAVE been sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of a man whose skeletal remains were found in a jute bag in scrubland in east Cork. A jury of ten men and two women found Luke Taylor (28) and Niall Long (33) guilty of the murder of Kieran Quilligan last week following a three-week trial at the Central Criminal Court in Cork. Kieran Quilligan (47) was missing for five months when his remains were found in a ravine at Whitewell, Rostellan on 29 January 2024. He had suffered nineteen broken bones after being attacked with fists and a hammer-like object. Gardaí had brought a PSNI cadaver dog to an area of interest to the investigation in east Cork where they discovered the remains in a one tonne gravel bag. At a sentencing hearing in Cork today, Stephen Quilligan, father of the late Kieran Quilligan, said that the two perpetrators, whom he referred to as “monsters”, would never be forgiven for what they had done. Mr Quilligan said that he knew that there was foul play involved when his son disappeared without trace on 1 September 2023. “It all started for us two years ago and it has been a nightmare of our family ever since. We want to thank the gardaí who never gave up. They said they would bring Kieran home and they did,” he said. “Due to the nature of this case, any time we asked what was going on, the gardaí could not tell us. We were told when the case would come up in court, everything would come out. “We were hearing what really went on for the first time and were shocked, angry and in disbelief that someone could do this to another person and pretend like nothing happened.” Mr Quilligan said that it was beyond difficult to listen to the “horror stories” that emerged over the course of the trial. He said that the defendants didn’t show “one bit of remorse” for murdering his son. He added that Kieran was a “loving son, brother and uncle” before thanking the gardaí and the prosecution team for treating Kieran “like a human being.” Catherine O’Flynn, the mother of Kieran Quilligan, said he was “adored” by his family. “Kieran had the biggest heart you ever seen. His birthday, 13 July 2023, was the last time I saw Kieran. If I had known what was going to happen I would never have left him leave the house,” she said. “I will never forgive them (Niall Long and Luke Taylor) for what they have put our family through.” Colette O’Driscoll, the partner of Kieran Quilligan, said that he left their home on 1 September 2023 and she never saw him again. Advertisement “Niall Long and Luke Taylor stole my future with the man I loved, adored and cherished.” She said that herself and Kieran were set to move in to their forever home when he was violently taken from this world. “Kieran was going to get the keys to his long awaited castle. Now unfortunately Kieran will never get the keys to his castle.” Whilst sentencing Luke Taylor and Niall Long to mandatory life imprisonment, Ms Justice Siobhan Lankford praised gardaí for the “exemplary” manner in which they carried out their comprehensive investigation. She said that the perpetrators might well have never been found other than for the enormous work of investigating gardaí. She also paid tribute to members of the Quilligan family for the manner in which they had conducted themselves in “difficult circumstances.” Ms Justice Lankford added that Kieran Quilligan was taken from this world in the “most egregious circumstances.” At the start of the sentencing hearing today, the coordinator of the Garda investigation, Det Garda Ann O’Sullivan of the Bridewell Garda Station in Cork, said that the two men subjected Kieran Quilligan to a “significant and sustained assault” on 1 September 2023. They then bundled him in to the boot of a car and brought him to a farmyard in Little Island. His body was then moved to the scrubland in Rostellan. She detailed the extensive harvesting of CCTV in the case which led gardaí to find the body of Kieran Quilligan and determine the identity of his killers. During the trial Prosecution senior counsel, Donal O’Sullivan, told the jury that the “instigating factor” for the murder was Kieran Quilligan stealing drugs and cash from Niall Long on 1 September 2023. Meanwhile, in the course of the trial the jurors heard evidence from Assistant State Pathologist, Dr Margaret Bolster who carried out a postmortem examination on the late Kieran Quilligan. Dr Bolster indicated that an exact cause of death could not be established because decomposition had led to the loss of organs. However, she stated that what was not at doubt was that the injuries suffered by Kieran Quilligan were consistent with a “severe assault.” Those injuries included fractures to his ribs, leg and hand bones, jaw bones and skull. Dr Bolster said whilst the remains were skeletonised there was a small piece of skin remaining which consisted of a tattoo with the word “Mother” and a date. The skull was separate from the body and there was a large amount of silt and vegetation. Father-of-two Niall Long is formerly of St Michael’s Close in Mahon in Cork, whilst Luke Taylor is previously of Cherry Lawn in Blackrock in Cork. Kieran Quilligan was living with his partner in Simon Community housing in Cork city at the time of his death.

German crypto and digital asset manager Deutsche Digital Assets (DDA) and Nordic cryptocurrency exchange Safello have announced the launch of the Safello Bittensor Staked TAO ETP. The launch comes as the crypto industry welcomes a growing number of digital asset-related products across the market, including the Bitcoin ETP by BlackRock. Meanwhile, Bittensor continues to attract attention as a top decentralized artificial intelligence (AI) project. Developments around AI, including from Big Tech giants Nvidia, Microsoft and Meta, have often pushed TAO and other AI tokens into the limelight. Frankfurt-based DDA, a pioneer in crypto exchange-traded products since 2017, announced the new product on October 29, 2025. The ETP is a collaboration with Safello and brings a physically backed Bittensor ETP to the expanding market. The product tracks the Kaiko Safello Staked Bittensor Index (KSSTAO) and is domiciled in Liechtenstein. Trading under ticker STAO (ISIN: DE000A4APQY4) on SIX is slated to commence to enhance seamless buying and selling during standard market hours. Moreover, the ETP is fully secured in cold storage by regulated custodian BitGo Europe GmbH and holds 100% physical TAO reserves. Investors are to benefit from total returns encompassing TAO’s price appreciation plus staking yields, automatically reinvested into the net asset value (NAV). With a competitive total expense ratio (TER) of 1.49%, it provides an accumulating income structure, ideal for portfolio diversification amid rising interest in AI-driven blockchain assets. Maximilian Lautenschläger, CEO and founder of DDA, emphasized the strategic fit: “We are excited to announce the launch of Safello Bittensor Staked TAO ETP through our collaboration with Safello. By leveraging DDA’s white-label ETP platform, we enable our partner to bring their innovative crypto investment strategies to market, while ensuring compliance with regulatory standards.” Bittensor (TAO) is currently trading at $425 and powers a groundbreaking peer-to-peer network, incentivizing collaborative machine learning. Participants contribute data, models, and compute power for tasks like image recognition, fraud detection, and protein structure prediction, earning TAO rewards in a proof-of-stake ecosystem. With a market cap exceeding $4.3 billion, Bittensor exemplifies the fusion of blockchain and AI, positioning it as a high-growth asset in the evolving digital economy. Safello CEO Emelie Moritz commented, “The launch of Safello Bittensor Staked TAO ETP underlines Safello’s conviction in decentralised AI. Bittensor is a prime example of how decentralized technology and AI are converging to reshape the future of value creation. Together with DDA, we’re making it possible for investors to easily access this innovation through a regulated and transparent investment vehicle.” Bittensor price reached highs of $457 on Oct. 29, but its all-time high is $767, which it hit back in April 2024.

Title: The Evolution of Capitalism: Why Markets Defy Feudal Aristocracy

In 2005, Citigroup analysts coined the term Plutonomy as an ideological provocation disguised as analysis. They argued that global growth rested disproportionately on the spending of the wealthy, especially the “top 1%.” According to this claim, the world economy follows the whims of the global elites’ demand, while the majority slips into irrelevance. The Plutonomy thesis reveals either ignorance of capitalism or ideological hostility toward it. Left-collectivist critics embrace it because it dresses capitalism as feudalism in modern clothes. But in essence, capitalism and feudalism are opposites. Feudalism chains wealth and power to the bloodline, preserving a static order. Capitalism breaks that order. It multiplies, redistributes and even annihilates wealth through innovation, entrepreneurship and competition. Plutonomy advocates point to inequality data to support their case. Yes, wealth concentration exists, but the inference those advocates draw from it is false. Capitalism’s logic is not one of privilege but freedom. Studies from Williams Group wealth consultancy show that two-thirds of wealthy families lose their fortune by the second generation, and 90% by the third. Concentration of wealth is not permanent but a phase in a cycle. The system does not malfunction when wealth clusters — it functions. Success receives reward, but failure swiftly destroys fortunes. The capitalist system rests on voluntary exchange, individual initiative and open competition. The moral principle is not “the few rule the many” but “each individual acts by right.” Critics mistake correlation for causation. Rising wealth at the top does not mean exclusion of the bottom. In fact, global data since 1980 demonstrates that while the top 1% grew richer, more than a billion people worldwide rose out of extreme poverty. China, India and much of Southeast Asia did not escape starvation because elites consumed more; they escaped because capitalism’s logic of production and trade reached their masses. The logic of capitalism undermines Plutonomy at its root. Elites may shape markets, but capitalism’s engine lies in mass participation. The wealthy do not dictate growth; they compete within a framework shaped by consumer sovereignty and entrepreneurial risk. No aristocracy ever built an industrial revolution; no plutocracy ever lifted billions from poverty. Only capitalism, driven by free exchange and broad demand, accomplished that. Capitalism treats wealth as a process, not a possession. Entrepreneurs must continually recreate wealth through production, innovation and risk-taking. Inherited fortunes erode when heirs fail to compete. Thomas Piketty claimed that capital tends to accumulate, but capitalist markets demonstrate the opposite: Unused capital dissipates. This competitive order forces every firm and every individual to justify their position anew. Aristocracy freezes history in bloodlines while capitalism accelerates history through challenge, destruction and renewal. Joseph Schumpeter identified this dynamic as creative destruction. He argued that capitalism thrives by overturning the old and replacing it with the new. Innosight data confirms this: In the 1950s, Fortune 500 companies survived on average for 60 years. Today, they survive for less than 20 years. Kodak dominated photography with 90% of the film market, yet it collapsed in 2012 because it ignored digital innovation. Canon, Sony and other firms seized Kodak’s market by betting on digital technologies. Nokia controlled 40% of the cellphone market in 1999, but its share fell below 5% by 2013 because it missed the smartphone revolution. Apple and Samsung seized Nokia’s throne. In 1980, oil and auto companies such as Exxon, GM and Ford dominated the global rankings. By 2022, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet and Tesla occupied those top positions. The World Economic Forum estimates that industries younger than 40 years generate over half of global GDP. Shifts in dominance reveal capitalism’s law: Innovators survive, complacent firms vanish. Entrepreneurial stories embody the same laws. American businessman Jeff Bezos launched Amazon in a garage in 1994 and expanded it into a trillion-dollar firm by leveraging capitalism’s infrastructure of financial markets and contract law. South African businessman Elon Musk reinvested profits from PayPal into Tesla and SpaceX, enterprises that toppled century-old automakers and state-run aerospace monopolies. American businessman Mark Zuckerberg built Facebook in a dormitory and redefined global communication. These entrepreneurs did not inherit aristocratic dynasties. They acted. Forbes reports that more than 70% of billionaires worldwide are self-made, and in China, over 80% built their fortunes as first-generation entrepreneurs. Capitalism rewards action, not birth. This dynamic reality delivers capitalism’s strongest refutation of aristocracy and Plutonomy. Aristocracy assumes permanence; capitalism enforces transience. Aristocracy passes property by bloodline; capitalism demands innovation by merit. Plutonomy imagines static classes; capitalism generates continual upheaval. In 19th-century American business life, the rise of the “inventor-businessman” type most clearly revealed capitalism’s difference from aristocracy. Andrew Carnegie, a poor immigrant from Scotland, rose to become one of the giants of the steel industry. John D. Rockefeller, starting from humble origins, founded Standard Oil and became the world’s first dollar billionaire. Rockefeller was born in 1839 in New York to a poor family. His father, William Avery Rockefeller, worked as a charlatan traveling salesman, always chasing ventures and failing to provide a steady income. His mother lived frugally and devotedly. Rockefeller grew up amidst poverty and uncertainty but absorbed discipline and thrift early on. At 16, he began working in an accounting firm. In his first years of work, he carefully tracked every dollar, saving some and donating some to charity. By his early twenties, he entered the oil business in Cleveland with his partners. At the time, oil was new and difficult to refine, yet Rockefeller turned these difficulties into advantages. Rockefeller founded Standard Oil in 1863 and quickly built it into the largest US oil company in refining, distribution and sales. He also tried to monopolize transportation by striking deals with railroad companies to gain cost advantages. This advantage lasted only until the state enacted antitrust laws. In 1911, the US Supreme Court declared Standard Oil a monopoly and ordered its breakup. Far from shrinking Rockefeller’s fortune, this ruling multiplied it, as the separated companies — Exxon, Chevron and Mobil — grew independently. The episode revealed a truth of the capitalist market: Even a monopoly, once broken, can generate more growth in a dynamic marketplace. Rockefeller also pioneered what we now call philanthropic capitalism. He donated hundreds of millions to institutions such as Harvard and the University of Chicago. The foundations he created in medicine and education still shape society today. He did not owe his wealth to the state, as state regulations tried to restrict him. He did not inherit aristocratic privilege, nor did he cling to feudal instincts of passing wealth intact to heirs. Instead, he taught his children thrift, philanthropy and entrepreneurship. Through his story, capitalism reveals its revolutionary and egalitarian nature: The son of a poor preacher left a permanent mark on world history through ability and hard work in the marketplace. The Rothschild family illustrates how intellect, numerical skill and entrepreneurship built a global banking network despite European antisemitism. Mayer Amschel Rothschild was born in 1744 in the Frankfurt ghetto, where Jews lived under restriction with scarce educational opportunities. Mayer displayed an extraordinary passion for books and numbers. As a youth, he apprenticed with a banker in Frankfurt, learning financial calculations. He then traded antiques and rare coins, building his first capital. This step gave him access to Frankfurt’s nobility. In the 1760s, Mayer achieved his breakthrough when he became financial advisor to Wilhelm IX, the Prince of Hesse-Kassel (a state within the Holy Roman Empire). He managed the prince’s wealth but showed greater genius by sending four of his five sons — Nathan Mayer, Saloman Mayer, Karl Mayer and James Mayer — to Europe’s capitals to establish a family banking network. Nathan went to London, Salomon to Vienna, Karl to Naples and James to Paris. The Rothschilds became the most influential financial family of 19th-century Europe. Their success came from superior knowledge, communication and risk management. Before the telegraph, they created networks that gave them faster access to market information. During the Napoleonic Wars, they controlled key information flows, lent money to Britain and helped finance the British army against France. The Rothschilds did not descend from a dynasty. They exemplified how a marginalized Jewish family could, despite prohibitions, become leaders in finance by investing in knowledge and commerce. The capitalist market valued their achievement, not their lineage. And although their descendants remain financially active, modern giants like BlackRock and Vanguard far surpass the influence the Rothschilds held a century ago. Their eclipse proves again that capitalism does not freeze into aristocracy but renews itself endlessly. Capitalism’s competitive nature creates a powerful resistance mechanism against the absolutization of economic power. Competition functions not as an external safeguard but as the system’s internal law, its self-regulating force. Those who claim that capitalists inevitably form cartels to seize markets misunderstand the essence of capitalism. Oligopolies may rise, and firms may dominate for a time, but such power cannot last. Knowledge flows, entrepreneurship pushes forward and innovation breaks every chain. The marketplace acts as a battlefield in which permanence is an illusion. What matters is the ability to adapt, not the possession of a temporary advantage. In the late 1980s, Microsoft commanded almost absolute dominance in global software with its Windows operating system and Office suite, which ran on over 80% of personal computers. Yet, this supremacy did not endure. Google rose by capturing the internet, Apple transformed communication through the iPhone and Linux opened doors for free software alternatives. Today, Microsoft remains powerful, yet it no longer controls the future of computing. The automobile industry reveals the same dynamic. For decades, General Motors, Ford and Chrysler ruled the US market. But Japanese firms —Toyota, Honda, Nissan — challenged them with efficient production and durable models. By the 1980s, Japanese automakers controlled nearly 30% of the US market, forcing Detroit into reform or collapse. In this century, Tesla has shattered the industry again, proving that even the giants of capitalism cannot insulate themselves from new rivals armed with better ideas. This fragility does not weaken capitalism; it strengthens it. Dynamism, not stagnation, defines its law. The rise of the East Asian Tigers — South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Hong Kong — illustrates capitalism’s transformative power. In 1960, South Korea’s GDP per capita barely reached $150; by 2020, it had risen to over $30,000. Taiwan, once an agrarian economy, became a global technology leader and now produces more than 54% of the world’s semiconductors through Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC). Singapore, a city-state without natural resources, climbed to rank among the wealthiest nations, with a GDP per capita surpassing $70,000. These countries escaped poverty not by state planning but by unleashing markets, encouraging exports, fostering education and creating an open environment for enterprise. Centrally planned economies show the opposite trajectory. The Soviet Union, despite immense resources, collapsed under inefficiency. Former supreme leader Mao Zedong’s China starved tens of millions. Only when Mao’s successor Deng Xiaoping’s reforms embraced markets in 1978 did China’s GDP begin to grow at an average of nearly 10% per year for three decades, lifting 800 million people out of extreme poverty. The real enemy of competition is not capitalism but the state. History shows that whenever governments step in to control markets, competition collapses. In the 17th century, the British Crown granted the East India Company exclusive rights to trade in Asia. Instead of innovation, this monopoly produced corruption, inefficiency and exploitation, until its collapse in the 19th century. In the 20th century, state-backed corporations in Latin America — such as Pemex in Mexico or Petrobras in Brazil — became centers of inefficiency and political patronage, draining resources without innovation. The United States itself has suffered similar distortions: The government’s antitrust case against AT&T in the 1980s reveals how state-protected dominance stalled telecommunications innovation. Once AT&T was broken up, competition flourished, giving rise to mobile telephony, the internet and the digital revolution. In the second half of the 20th century, South Korea and Taiwan embraced export-led capitalism, transforming from impoverished to high-income economies. Between 1960 and 1990, South Korea’s GDP per capita grew nearly tenfold. By contrast, North Korea, under state control, stagnated in famine and isolation. The same divide appeared in Germany: West Germany’s market economy surged after 1948, while East Germany’s socialist experiment collapsed under inefficiency and repression. Latin America shows the same truth. Venezuela — with the world’s largest proven oil reserves — nationalized industries and imposed state control. By 2020, its GDP had contracted by over 70% from the previous decade, inflation exceeded one million percent and millions fled the country in response to the economic crisis. Meanwhile, Chile liberalized markets in the 1970s and 80s. From 1990 to 2015, its poverty rate fell from 40% to under 10%, and it became Latin America’s richest nation per capita. In China, state-owned enterprises (SOEs) consume over 30% of the country’s bank credit yet generate less than 10% of GDP growth. World Bank data shows SOEs earn returns on assets less than half those of private firms. They survive on subsidies, cheap credit and political protection. By contrast, private firms — Huawei, Tencent, Alibaba and BYD — compete globally and drive breakthroughs in telecom, digital finance and electric vehicles. The difference lies in rules: SOEs live by privilege, private firms by competition. SOEs employ barely 10% of China’s workforce yet capture most corporate credit, starving small firms of capital. Productivity lags because connected giants hoard resources. Meanwhile, the private sector — responsible for 80% of urban jobs and 70% of innovation — faces crackdowns whenever it threatens state power. The West tells the story in another form. The 2008 financial crisis showed how intervention entrenches failure. US and European governments bailed out American International Group (AIG), Citigroup, Royal Bank of Scotland and others, freezing competition and rewarding recklessness. The US Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) spent $700 billion rescuing failing banks, while the Eurozone added trillions in guarantees. Instead of disciplining error, states preserved it. These bailouts created a sense of moral hazard. Banks knew governments would shield them, so accountability vanished. A decade of ultra-low rates followed, keeping “zombie companies” alive. This was not a result of capitalism failing, but capitalism blocked. The corrective force of failure capitalism provides, was replaced by political privilege. Russian-American writer and philosopher Ayn Rand foresaw it: “The difference between a welfare state and a totalitarian state is only a matter of time.” When governments protect the incompetent, they turn markets from arenas of merit into shelters of privilege. The market demands discipline. Remove that truth, and freedom vanishes. State-backed oligopolies, rent-seeking firms and politically privileged corporations represent the intrusion of non-capitalist elements into the system. Rand captured this with brutal clarity in her novel Atlas Shrugged: When you see that trading is done, not by consent, but by compulsion — when you see that in order to produce, you need permission from men who produce nothing — when you see that money is flowing to those who deal, not in goods, but in favors … you may know that your society is doomed. Her warning underscores the point: government favoritism replaces merit with power and enterprise with privilege. A genuine free market grants no actor permanent advantage. Every success must be tested, every fortune re-earned, every firm challenged. Collectivist regimes historically reveal the true nature of plutonomy. The Soviet Union gave Politburo elites privileges comparable to those of Western billionaires, while ordinary people could not access basic goods. In China, Mao’s Cultural Revolution impoverished millions, while Party cadres enjoyed privileged lives. During Deng’s reforms, the state integrated market elements but ensured that real capital accumulation still depended on Party ties. In contemporary China, the case of business magnate and investor Jack Ma illustrates this reality: after criticizing government policies, he lost public visibility, and the state restructured Alibaba (a multinational technology company), demonstrating how easily political authority can dismantle market success. The case of Venezuela illustrates the modern socialist version of plutonomy. Former Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez built his 21st-century socialism not by distributing oil revenues to the people but by concentrating them within the state apparatus and a loyal elite. Managers of Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA) enriched themselves rapidly in foreign currency, while the general population lacked access to basic food and medicine. These cases prove that plutonomy emerges not in capitalism but in collectivism. Capitalism’s stability and sustainability depend on a broad consumer base that responds to production. Economic growth and prosperity come not from the excessive wealth of the minority but from the consumption capacity of the majority. The capitalist market functions as a democratic decision-making arena. Consumers, through their daily purchasing choices, effectively cast votes in the marketplace. These votes reflect not only economic value but also preference. The market thus becomes a ballot box where products and services, not rulers, compete. Consumer behavior directly shapes economic existence. The consumer acts as capitalism’s “silent voter” — silent because the vote is cast by buying, not speaking. Yet this silence masks immense power: the collective choices of consumers decide whether a product stays on shelves, spreads or vanishes. Unlike centrally planned systems, capitalism rests on pluralism and bottom-up consent. Liberal democratic philosophy aligns with this capitalist structure. Just as political leaders rise through popular votes, entrepreneurs and producers survive only through consumer choice. No matter their capital, ventures without customers collapse. This reality highlights capitalism’s populist and majoritarian nature, not an aristocratic one. Capitalism is no elitist club but a competitive arena built on mass consent. For a product to remain in the market, it must resonate with the public. This constant need for validation keeps capitalism open to pressures from below. Broad participation is the indispensable condition of capitalist democracy. If middle- and lower-income groups cannot participate, the voting mechanism breaks down. Capitalism requires individuals not just to exist as consumers but to function effectively as consumers. The democratic nature of the market creates fairness and dynamism. Consumer choice directs supply, drives innovation, raises efficiency and prevents waste. Each purchase acts as a “yes” vote; each rejection, a “no” vote. This continuous micro-level voting process builds a coordination mechanism more precise and dynamic than any central planner could achieve. The market generates a natural order through supply and demand. Austrian-British economist and philosopher Friedrich Hayek described this as spontaneous order, where knowledge spreads through millions of free decisions, not through central authority. No ministry or planning agency can collect and process such knowledge. French diplomat, political philosopher and historian Alexis de Tocqueville highlights a fundamental tension in Democracy in America: In democratic societies, when freedom is sacrificed to equality, people become passive and consent to their own chains. The plutonomy discourse offers exactly such chains: it promises not freedom but passivity under the guise of equality. Capitalism rests on the moral principle of consent. Neither producer nor consumer, neither employer nor employee, enters the system by force. This order, built on mutual benefit, secures not only economic efficiency but also individual autonomy. Capitalist economics allow the individual to secure their place through labor, capital or ideas. In contrast, plutonomy undermines freedom by persuading individuals to believe in systemic determinism rather than their own potential. This mentality denies individual worth and responsibility, portraying success not as the product of productivity but as a matter of birth privilege. As a result, young individuals turn away from entrepreneurship, and potential inventors give way to “pseudo-opponents” who hate the system yet make no contribution.

Title: Will Ethereum Outperform Bitcoin In 2026?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/10/29/will-ethereum-outperform-bitcoin-in-2026/
Time Published: 2025-10-29T13:14:08Z

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Ethereum’s impressive 120% rise over the past six months, reaching approximately $4,000, has significantly eclipsed Bitcoin’s modest 20% increase during this timeframe. This isn’t merely a fleeting moment—various fundamental factors indicate that ETH might sustain its outperformance trajectory.​ Before we explore the specifics, if you’re interested in an upside with less volatility compared to holding a single stock or token like ETH or BTC, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has thoroughly outperformed its benchmark—a mix of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indices—and has secured returns surpassing 105% since its inception. Why is this the case? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks have delivered superior returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster experience, as seen in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Investing in a single stock or token without thorough analysis can be risky. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (a combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices), delivering robust returns for investors. Why is this the situation? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks has offered a responsive approach to maximize gains during optimistic market conditions while minimizing losses when markets decline, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics. Ethereum’s superior performance indicates genuine fundamental advantages: the adoption of institutional ETFs, upcoming technical enhancements, deflationary tokenomics, and its foundational role in the expanding DeFi ecosystem. The December Fusaka upgrade and ongoing institutional accumulation imply that this trend might continue well into 2026.​ Nevertheless, investors need to balance ETH’s higher reward potential with its elevated volatility and technical complexity.

Title: Circle Launches Arc Testnet With BlackRock, Visa, and AWS — A New Era for Stablecoin Infrastructure
URL: https://beincrypto.com/circle-launches-arc-testnet/
Time Published: 2025-10-29T13:05:46Z

Written byPaul Kim Edited byOihyun Kim Circle, the issuer of USDC, the world’s second-largest stablecoin by market capitalization, has unveiled the public testnet for its proprietary Layer 1 blockchain network, ‘Arc.’ The ambitious project has garnered significant backing, with over 100 global firms participating, including BlackRock, Visa, Goldman Sachs, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Coinbase. Circle announced the launch of the Arc testnet via a press release on Monday. Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire emphasized the network’s mission: “Arc provides an opportunity for all companies to build services atop enterprise-grade network infrastructure.” He stressed that the platform is designed to implement an “open, inclusive, and efficient global economic system on the internet.” Circle released Arc as its recently introduced native blockchain. USDC traditionally relies on public chains like Ethereum for transactions. However, these networks often create high, volatile fees and unpredictable costs, which Arc aims to resolve. Arc is unique because it utilizes USDC, the US dollar-pegged stablecoin, as its native gas token. This design offers predictable fees and an economically efficient cost structure. Circle plans for Arc to provide blockchain infrastructure that meets the stringent requirements of the financial sector, which existing public chains have struggled to satisfy. The Arc testnet allows experimentation with new functions in a secure environment using test assets. The system supports various financial applications, including lending, capital markets, foreign exchange, and global payments. To achieve this, it seamlessly integrates with Circle’s existing stablecoin platform. Regional stablecoin issuers from Japan (JPYC), Brazil (BRLA), and Canada (QCAD) are currently participating in the testnet, with plans to expand to dollar- and euro-based issuers. The testnet launch has attracted broad institutional participation. Major Wall Street firms are involved in the project, including BNY Mellon, Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), State Street, BlackRock, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, HSBC, and Standard Chartered (SC). Technology and payment giants like AWS, Mastercard, and Visa have joined, and leading cryptocurrency exchanges like Coinbase, Kraken, and Robinhood are participating. Circle stated its long-term plan is to transition the development of Arc to a decentralized governance system, expanding validator participation to establish a community-centric operational structure. As stablecoin issuers pursue control over settlement infrastructure, Circle is not alone in building its own Layer-1 blockchain while issuing stablecoins. Companies like Tether (with Stable) and Stripe (with Tempo) are following similar paths, seeking to escape dependence on external networks like Ethereum or Tron. By owning their base layer, these firms can directly embed compliance features, control transaction costs, and ensure predictable performance without competing for blockspace with unrelated activities. For instance, Tether shapes the ambitions of blockchain through Stable. The company raised $28 million in seed funding to build a dedicated Layer-1 blockchain optimized for USDT transactions. The economics make this strategy particularly compelling for large issuers. Revenue from owning the settlement layer could far exceed traditional payment processing margins. Additionally, custom chains allow implementation of KYC checks at the protocol level and enable companies to issue their own gas tokens, creating new revenue streams while reducing operational dependencies. Technical optimization provides significant advantages for stablecoin-specific use cases. General-purpose blockchains prioritize programmability and composability, not the low-fee, high-throughput requirements of payment systems. Purpose-built chains like Stable can offer sub-second block times, parallel execution, and guaranteed finality—features essential for real-world payments and remittances that mainstream adoption demands.

Today’s top news: The world’s biggest money transfer company is going on-chain. And it didn’t pick Ethereum or Bitcoin. 📌 What Happened Western Union, the 173-year-old global money transfer giant, just announced it’s launching a stablecoin on Solana. Western Union will issue a U.S. dollar stablecoin called USDPT, built on Solana, with custody provided by Anchorage Digital. The rollout begins in 2026, targeting hundreds of millions of users across LatAm, Africa, and Southeast Asia, regions where stablecoins already dominate real economic usage. The stablecoin will plug straight into Western Union’s existing licensed fiat rails and 4,500+ corridors, enabling people to move dollars across borders without banks, ACH delays, or predatory FX fees. And here’s the curveball: Western Union says it plans to keep supporting cash-in and cash-out locations, effectively becoming a global on/off ramp for Solana. 🗣️ What They’re Saying “For 175 years, we’ve been connecting people, moving $150 billion a year. Digital assets is the next evolution. We looked at alternatives, and came to the conclusion that Solana was the right choice.” - Devin McGranahan, CEO of Western Union Why is Western Union launching a stablecoin on Solana? > Here's what Devin McGranahan, CEO of Western Union, said 👇 "For 175 years, we've been connecting people, moving $150 billion a year.

This is massive for both Solana and stablecoins. Solana just got validation from a major payments player on a global scale. Payments is crypto’s biggest real-world use case today, and Solana now anchors the largest remittance migration play in history. As for stablecoins, the are clearly eating the world, and Western Union is capitulating in. Global remittances are a $860 billion market. If even 10% of those flows move to stablecoins over the next two years, that’s $86 billion in annual on-chain volume. Largely on Solana. Stablecoins are the future - and Solana is a part of that future. A really nice narrative win, on the same day that Bitwise’s Solana ETF set the record for highest volume for any new ETF launch in 2025.

UPDATED 08:00 EDT / OCTOBER 29 2025 by Duncan Riley Cybersecurity and data protection company Acronis International GmbH today announced the launch of Acronis Cyber Protect Local, a new solution that delivers natively integrated cyber resilience for on-premises, sovereign private cloud, and air-gapped information technology and operational technology environments. Cyber Protect Local is designed for organizations where cloud deployment is not an option and combines backup, recovery, cybersecurity and endpoint management in a single platform. The service delivers agile, resilient and compliant IT and OT operations while reducing costs and operational complexity. The new offering keeps data securely within the customer’s perimeter to ensure full data sovereignty and regulatory compliance, the company says. It supports legacy systems and modern hypervisors, including Windows XP, OT/ICS environments, Nutanix, Proxmox, VMware and Hyper-V, to ensure complete coverage across mixed infrastructures. Acronis says customers benefit from strong backward compatibility, one-click self-service recovery and expanded workload portability for virtual and hyperconverged environments. Acronis Cyber Protect offers natively integrated endpoint security and management and automated discovery of unmanaged devices via Acronis Device Sense that help reduce tooling complexity while enhancing operational efficiency. Physical-to-virtual, virtual-to-virtual and cross-platform recovery are simplified, with no need for separate agent installations to allow organizations to migrate workloads seamlessly while maintaining protection. Key features include unified cyber resilience, with support for backups, recovery, cybersecurity and endpoint management in a single agent and single console. There’s also data sovereignty, with management and data kept within a customer perimeter to ensure compliance, as well as comprehensive workload support, artificial intelligence-driven automation and cross-platform agility. “The systems that ensure we have access to water, electricity, technology, healthcare and transportation are vulnerable targets for cyberattacks due to their reliance on outdated software and hardware,” said President Gaidar Magdanurov. “Acronis Cyber Protect Local brings the power and innovation of our trusted cloud cyber protection platform directly on-premises, running on a dedicated management server within the customer’s internal networks to meet strict security and data location requirements.” Based in Switzerland, Acronis is a venture capital-backed startup that has raised $658 million over four rounds, including rounds of $147 million in 2019 and $250 million on a valuation north of $2.5 billion in 2021. Investors in the company include BlackRock Inc., CVC Capital Partners Ltd., Goldman Sachs Investment Partners and Insight Partners LP. In August 2024, it was announced that Swedish investment firm EQT was acquiring a majority stake in Acronis. Support our mission to keep content open and free by engaging with theCUBE community.

Title: Trump Mulls Replacing Jerome Powell As Fed Chair As Shortlist Narrows

Time Published: 2025-10-29T10:30:39Z

US President Donald Trump has announced plans to remove Jerome Powell as head of the Federal Reserve, citing incompetence. Amid the plot to remove Powell, there is a five-horse race for potential replacements for the current Fed Chair as Trump’s top choice declines the offer. US President Donald Trump has fired a new round of criticisms at Jerome Powell over his handling of the Federal Reserve, hinting at an imminent replacement. According to a report, Trump noted that plans are underway to name a new Fed Chair before the end of the year. Trump disclosed the plans during a dinner for business leaders in Tokyo as part of his week-long trip to Asia. The US President has previously railed against Powell over his refusal to cut interest rates, with the Federal Reserve headquarters fiasco fuelling more criticisms. “We have an incompetent head of the Fed. We got a bad Fed guy, but he’ll be out of there in a few months, and we will get somebody new,” said Trump. Powell’s term as Fed Chair is expected to come to an end in May 2026, bringing an end to a nearly eight-year tenure at the helm of affairs. Early in the week, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent revealed that the administration is considering five potential replacements for Powell. At the moment, the five finalists include White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett, BlackRock executive Rick Rieder, Fed Vice Chair for Supervision Michelle Bowman, former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, and current Fed Governor Christopher Waller. Bessent noted that he will do one more round of interviews on the five finalists before formally submitting their names to the White House after the Thanksgiving holiday. Meanwhile, Trump had previously tapped Bessent to replace Powell, but the Treasury Secretary declined to serve as Federal Reserve chair. “I’m thinking about him for the Fed, but he won’t take the job,” said Trump on Bessent’s refusal. “He likes being Treasury Secretary, so we’re not thinking about him really.” Despite Powell’s previous reluctance to cut interest rates, cryptocurrency markets are pricing in a rate cut in October’s FOMC meeting. Data from the FedWatch CME tool pegs the probability for a rate cut to 375-400 bps at 99.9%, potentially representing back-to-back cuts after September’s easing. At the moment, Bitcoin is trading at $113,096, while Ethereum is holding the $4,000 psychological price point. However, investors are eyeing a bullish upswing following forecasted rate cuts that are expected to push the global cryptocurrency market capitalization above $4 trillion.

Title: T. Rowe Price Wades Into the Crypto Arena

The legacy mutual fund provider has filed for a crypto index fund, bringing TradFi and DeFi one step closer together. Lilly Riddle lilly@thedailyupside.com The grass is always greener on the other side of the fence, and now T. Rowe Price’s bighorn sheep is exploring it. The $1.7 trillion asset manager wants to bring an actively managed crypto index ETF to market, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing. The behemoth firm’s willingness to enter the nascent crypto market, expanding beyond its traditional, mutual fund roots after almost two years of spot crypto approvals, marks a big step in the acceptance of decentralized finance by legacy mutual fund providers. The fund’s numerous potential holdings also makes it unique: It would hold anywhere from five to 15 coins and aim to outperform the FTSE US Listed Crypto Index. “[T. Rowe Price] follows a bunch of legacy firms that are already in [crypto], but what’s interesting about theirs is that it’s an index,” said Tyrone Ross, CEO of 401 Financial and Turnqey Labs. “It’s actively managed, you get broad exposure, and it’s from an almost 100-year-old name. That’s a big deal.” T. Rowe’s filing comes on the heels of other legacy firms launching their own funds for the first time. Tweedy, Browne, launched its first ETF, COPY, late last year, with others, including Lazard and Praxis, following suit. Meanwhile, BlackRock and Franklin Templeton continue to push for tokenization. The trend is a result of both rampant bleeding across the mutual fund class and an increasingly deregulated crypto environment, Ross said. “It’s one of those things where the regulatory skies have cleared,” he said. “A legacy name, I think that’s going to attract a lot of institutional capital.” A T. Rowe Price spokesperson declined to comment. Other traditional mutual fund providers that launched ETFs this year include: Crypto? I’ll Pass. Still, there are some notable holdouts, namely Vanguard and Charles Schwab, that have yet to launch their own crypto funds. Schwab said it plans to offer spot bitcoin trading in the first half of 2026, but Vanguard executives have for years spoken out against cryptocurrencies, with former CEO Tim Buckley telling CNBC in 2018 that Vanguard would “never” launch a bitcoin fund. But the future is less certain. “I’m in the camp that I don’t see Vanguard doing it,” Ross said. “But money is a powerful thing.” Investors who want in on Alpha Architect’s next 351 exchange ETF no longer need at least $1 million — as long as their account is at Charles Schwab. Pictet Asset Management, which oversees $800 billion, recently launched three ETFs that lean on AI, with plans to add two emerging markets strategies early next year. The Goldman Sachs MSCI World Private Equity Return Tracker ETF does its best to replicate PE performance with publicly traded stocks. Banks are writing off hundreds of millions of dollars in loan defaults, and the wind down in CLO trading may not be a bad thing. The acquisition marks one of the first major purchases of an ETF provider by a US crypto trading platform. Either one of these popular tax-advantaged strategies can help clients diversify and defer tax bills, but they can be complex as well as costly. Soon, ETF shareholders may opt for proxy policies that could support (or oppose) issues like the $1 trillion Tesla pay package for Elon Musk. Some of the largest S&P 500-based funds lost billions this year as institutional investors sought out cheaper alternatives. The rare earths industry is booming as the materials are used less in electric vehicles and more in AI data centers. Asset managers have repurposed sustainable funds amid a pullback from them in the US. This change is more substantial than most. Tokenized securities are moving closer to a reality as issuers make plans to bring more assets and funds on-chain. Even with the lights out at the SEC, it’s unlikely that ETF issuers seeking 3x and 5x funds will sail through the approval process. © 2025 The Daily Upside

Title: Top AIG Exec Has Major Fossil Fuel Ties

This article is published in partnership with the Center for Media and Democracy. At the end of July, a group of residents of Brownsville, Texas, gathered to discuss the risk of explosions from a new methane export facility—Rio Grande LNG—that is being built right next to a SpaceX rocket facility with a history of explosions. Their fear? That their communities risk being blown up due to ongoing accidents in both sectors. Indeed, just the month before, an enormous explosion rocked the SpaceX facility in Brownsville. “They’re attacking us. They’re killing us,” a resident told Telemundo, referring to the extraordinary fossil fuel infrastructure expansion in the border city. More from Matthew Cunningham-Cook Rio Grande LNG is one of the most expansive methane build-outs in the country, with the project set to cost $18 billion and handle a capacity of 17.6 million tons per year of liquefied natural gas, which would make it the second-largest methane export facility in the U.S. Its largest ownership stake is held by NextDecade, a publicly traded fossil fuel firm, but it is also backed by Global Infrastructure Partners, a private equity subsidiary of BlackRock, and TotalEnergies, a major French oil and gas firm. Construction has continued despite the project being in ongoing legal limbo, with the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals blocking its regulatory approvals last year. Despite the challenges of explosions, legal uncertainty, and the ongoing climate crisis, American International Group (AIG) is insuring Rio Grande LNG. This insurance arrangement comes as a Center for Media and Democracy (CMD) investigation shows that John G. Rice, AIG’s lead independent director, holds the exact same position at Baker Hughes, a global fossil fuel technology company that has received major contracts from both Rio Grande LNG and Calcasieu Pass LNG, which is also insured by AIG. AIG is one of the top ten insurers of fossil fuel companies in the country, and a report by Insure Our Future, a climate advocacy group, found that it collects over $500 million annually in premiums from insuring the fossil fuel industry and held $27.4 billion in fossil fuel investments as of 2022. In addition to the Rio Grande project and Calcasieu Pass LNG Phase 1 (owned by Venture Global), AIG is also insuring Cameron LNG (majority-owned by Sempra and backed by KKR, Mitsubishi, and TotalEnergies) on the Gulf Coast of Louisiana, along with historically insuring the Gulf LNG and Freeport LNG projects. The relationship between AIG and Baker Hughes has not been publicly disclosed prior to this. In its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), AIG does not disclose that the projects it is insuring give major contracts to Baker Hughes despite the fact that the relationships could be material and, as a result, compromise federal standards on director independence. AIG has only disclosed that Rice is a director at Baker Hughes, not that he is its lead independent director, which is the second-most powerful position in a company when the CEO is also the chairman of the firm, as is the case with both Baker Hughes and AIG. Yaron Nili, a professor at Duke University School of Law who has studied director independence issues, told CMD that AIG’s failure to disclose that Rice is the lead independent director as opposed to an ordinary director at Baker Hughes could be considered “problematic,” and added that there is a “requirement [by AIG] to disclose anything that materially would impact their independence.” “These industries are so intertwined, as evidenced by Rice having these dual roles,” Rick Morris, an insurance campaigner at Public Citizen, told CMD. “They’re sacrificing our ability to get property insurance … in order to continue to make short-term profits off of the very causes of climate change.” The Gulf Coast is one of the most burdened regions on the planet when it comes to fossil fuels, with 20 new or expanded export facilities currently being proposed or under construction. There are now eight functioning LNG export facilities in the U.S., but if all the proposed projects get built nationwide, that number will balloon to 31. Liquefied natural gas is mostly methane, which is 28 times more effective than CO2 at trapping heat in the atmosphere, and currently accounts for 11 percent of global emissions. In 2022, a “Banking on Climate Chaos” report estimated that if the 18 proposed new fossil fuel export facilities on the Gulf were completed, they would generate 1.5 billion tons of greenhouse gas emissions per year, equivalent to emissions from 320 million cars. With the growth of fracking and export infrastructure on the Gulf Coast—along with a monumental increase in demand from Europe in the aftermath of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022—natural gas exports have expanded rapidly, with a tripling of U.S. exports between 2019 and 2024. Subscribe for analysis that goes beyond the noise. In January 2024, the Biden administration put a pause on new LNG export approvals, citing environmental and energy security concerns. A federal judge in Louisiana then blocked that pause in June of last year, but in January of this year President Trump ordered it to be lifted on the first day he returned to office. Just before the presidential transition (in December 2024), Biden’s Energy Department also released a report warning that unfettered LNG exports could drive up prices for U.S. consumers and worsen the impacts of climate change. Trump, who campaigned on the promise to “drill, baby, drill” and push American dominance in dirty energy, has firmly rejected that approach. Instead, his administration has fast-tracked new LNG export infrastructure, allowing these exports to hit record highs as the president has tied access to U.S. markets to foreign purchases of American LNG. In the first quarter of 2025, AIG posted $460 million worth of losses from the fires in Los Angeles, which were exacerbated by climate change. Insure Our Future, which advocates for insurance industry accountability in climate change, estimated in December 2024 that $600 billion in property and casualty losses globally were due to climate change–related issues, which accounted for 38 percent of total losses in the sector. “AIG is one of the largest insurers of methane export terminals on the Gulf Coast,” Ethan Nuss, an organizing strategist at the Rainforest Action Network, told CMD. He cited a major disaster in August during dredging as part of the massive new Calcasieu Pass terminal, which will be one of the largest in the world. “There was a huge overflow of dredging sediment into public waterways and fishing grounds of the local fishing communities who have fished those waters for generations,” Nuss explained. Nuss pointed out that AIG generally seems to turn a blind eye to risks when insuring the methane build-out. At one point, the company insured Freeport LNG in Freeport, Texas (also on the Gulf Coast), which experienced a major combustion event in June 2022 that “sent flames shooting 450 feet into the air, injuring beachgoers, shaking residents’ homes and sending tons of toxic chemicals into the air,” according to Melanie Oldham, a Freeport resident, in a 2023 press release. “To this day the community has not received basic safety guarantees from the company that the problems that led to that explosion have been resolved,” Nuss said. In response to investor pressure, AIG released what it calls a “climate roadmap” last year. Yet Nuss says that the firm has continued to prioritize its relationships with the fossil fuel industry. “AIG says that they care about climate and are in the process of developing a climate action plan, but they are actively insuring and backing this very industry that we know is incompatible with a livable climate,” he said. Rice’s role at Baker Hughes shows that there is a “very clear relationship between AIG at a corporate level and their stake in the methane industry. The stakes couldn’t be [higher], not only for those … who live next to these dangerous terminals, with the risk of explosions and loss of livelihood and threats to their health. There’s also the threat to [our] shared climate. We know that if we have any hope of a livable climate we cannot afford to build new methane terminals, full stop,” Nuss said, citing research from the International Energy Agency to buttress his concerns about insurers’ complicity in exacerbating the crisis. Morris of Public Citizen draws a line between AIG’s continued underwriting of fossil fuel projects amid the escalating climate crisis to its role in the 2008 financial crisis, when the company insured complex financial products that detonated the global economy, requiring a $182 billion bailout from the U.S. government. The firm’s share price has never meaningfully recovered in the 17 years since that crisis. “In 2008, the [world] faced a financial crash caused by speculative activities by companies like AIG,” Morris noted. “Those investments caused a crisis in the housing market [that] trickled down to affect every American and just about every country on the globe. [Now] AIG continues to play fast and loose with the U.S. housing market [through] their investments in fossil fuels, spiking the rates that Americans pay for their home insurance. When people cannot afford home insurance … they cannot get a mortgage to buy a home, period. When you look at AIG’s central role in the 2008 financial crisis it is difficult not to draw stark parallels to the crisis we face today.” Morris underscored the critical role insurers play in the fossil fuel infrastructure expansion, noting that “you can’t find investors for a fossil fuel project if that project is not insured first.” AIG—and the insurance industry as a whole—“is bent on squeezing every last cent out of the American people while abandoning them at the very time that they need to rely on their insurance.” In a statement, Baker Hughes told CMD that the company “is committed to ethical business practices, transparency, and full compliance with all applicable disclosure obligations”—yet it failed to make its general counsel available for an interview.

Will the incoming payment chains shake Ethereum’s stablecoin market share? If the test is successful, the payment-focused chain could soon hit the public mainnet for everyone. It signals incoming shifts across the stablecoin payment ecosystem, and whether Ethereum will hold its ground remains to be seen. Circle, the issuer of the USDC stablecoin, is close to launching its Arc chain – A global payment-focused L1 powered by digital dollars. In a statement on 28 October, the firm said that it had begun public testing for the chain alongside key design partners. The partners include top banks, insurers, and asset managers like BlackRock, HSBC, and Absa, among others. According to Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire, the partners have billions of users and handle trillions of dollars in assets across the globe. He claimed that Arc can seamlessly allow local markets and builders to connect to the global economy. Allaire called it the “economic OS of the internet,” and added, “This geographic diversity highlights a defining strength of Arc: its purpose-built to connect every local market to the global economy.” Source: X Beyond global and agentic payments, Arc also aims to support on-chain FX (foreign exchange) and capital markets (tokenization). In fact, BlackRock’s Global Head of Digital Assets, Robert Mitchnick, underscored FX and tokenization as key interests for them in the project. He said, “Exploring Arc will provide insight into how stablecoin-denominated settlement and onchain FX capabilities might enable more efficient capital markets and unlock additional utility for onchain assets.” Arc is not the only purpose-built project seeking to rewrite payment and capital markets via on-chain rails though. Google, Stripe, and Tether have similar plans. In fact, Tether-backed Plasma [XPL] is already live and handles about $6 billion of the stablecoin supply. It’s now the fifth-largest chain for digital dollars. Source: DeFiLlama Google’s GUCL and Stripe’s Tempo are expected to launch in the near future. Collectively, the new chains could challenge Ethereum’s market share in stablecoin settlement, according to some analysts. Out of the current $305 billion in total stablecoin supply, Ethereum controls $162 billion or 53%. Tron [TRX] handles about a quarter of the overall market, while the rest is shared among other chains. However, in terms of stablecoin transfers, Ethereum’s volumes have been making record figures every month. In fact, for the first time, the stablecoin volume crossed the $2 trillion milestone on Ethereum this October. Source: The Block Even so, it remains to be seen whether Arc, Plasma, Tempo, or Google’s payment chains will grab Ethereum’s market share.

Title: Saudi Arabia could become an AI focal point

SUBSCRIBE & SAVE Less than $3 per week A state-backed AI21 project hopes to rival China and the United States China and the United States are widely seen as the top two countries making artificial intelligence advancements, but there’s another nation looking to get in the game: Saudi Arabia. The wealth of Saudi businessmen is attracting outside investors to the Gulf kingdom as it tries to entice American tech companies to expand AI operations. But many are skeptical of what Saudi Arabia’s AI push could mean for the tech world and beyond. The nation wants to expand its tech influence by using AI, as “few nations can match the kingdom’s cheap energy, deep pockets and open land,” said The New York Times. All of these things are “ingredients that tech firms need to operate the vast, power-hungry data centers that run modern AI.” The kingdom’s de facto leader, Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, is “seizing a chance to turn Saudi Arabia’s oil wealth into tech influence.” Saudi officials have been trying to woo American tech companies to the desert, with “executives from OpenAI, Google, Qualcomm, Intel and Oracle” all set to meet at an upcoming Middle Eastern investment summit, said the Times. Many of these executives “will be keen to seek out the opportunities that change tends to bring,” said Bloomberg, and will look to “divine the kingdom’s plans for the more than $200 billion it earns each year from oil exports.” The country is additionally building several AI data centers that may further entice U.S. brands.

Riyadh is also looking to strengthen its own AI development through Humain, a state-owned AI company backed by the Saudi sovereign wealth fund. The company believes it can eventually be the “third-largest AI provider in the world, behind the United States and China,” Humain CEO Tareq Amin said to CNBC. Humain is looking toward U.S. moguls in an effort to boost itself; Blackstone and BlackRock, two of the largest investment companies on Wall Street, are “already vying to invest billions of dollars with the firm,” said Bloomberg. Saudi Arabia is well on its way to building this AI groundwork, as Humain “offers AI services and products, including data centers, AI infrastructure, cloud capabilities and advanced AI models,” and is also developing a computer operating system that “enables users to speak to a computer to tell it to perform tasks,” said Reuters. But not everyone is happy about Saudi Arabia’s rapid development of AI, largely due to the country’s various human rights abuse allegations and treatment of women. Other experts don’t believe the hype around Saudi tech. Saudi Arabia has a notably “shallow pool of AI expertise,” and many “warn of a global glut in computing capacity as governments and companies race to build data centers faster than they can profit from them,” said the Times. Crown Prince bin Salman has said that Humain’s goal is to handle 6% of the global AI workload — but this could be a stretch. Tech experts “can never say never,” John Dinsdale, a senior analyst for Synergy, said to the Times. “But I can’t imagine any circumstances that would enable Saudi Arabia to achieve 6% of the world’s AI compute capacity.” A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com Justin Klawans has worked as a staff writer at The Week since 2022.

Germany’s dramatic economic collapse is dragging its geopolitical standing down with it. Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul has now learned what it means to be treated as a second-tier diplomat, receiving the red card from Beijing. A humiliation and a reprimand for Germany. The school of life can be cruel. Growing up usually means losing lofty ideals, fringe ideologies and the dreamy mindset of an inexperienced existence to the harsh reality of the world. Reality follows its own rules, unimpressed by self-delusion. That moment of maturity, the exit from the bubble of hermetically-sealed party ideology, has now arrived for Germany’s top diplomat. A Minister of Fantasies Johann Wadephul, who only recently wandered through wonderland attributing the German economic miracle to Turkish immigrants, had to cancel his first official visit to China at the last minute because Beijing saw no need to speak with a German delegation. The Christian Democrat is learning, much like his BlackRock-seasoned party colleague Friedrich Merz, that Germany’s dramatic economic decline is being followed instantly by a loss of geopolitical relevance. Wadephul’s first China trip was intended as a reset in the strained diplomatic relationship with Beijing. A high-profile business delegation was set to accompany him and help ease tensions over critical rare earth supplies. China has been threatening a complete export ban for weeks, a measure that would instantly paralyze key German industries. Suddenly Business Matters The delegation was to include representatives from the German automotive industry, Siemens Healthineers, the German Robotics Association and a leading importer of rare earth elements. Together, they were meant to relieve pressure in Beijing and secure access to the essential resources that Germany’s industrial base cannot function without. When Beijing made clear that it would not entertain additional talks beyond the mandatory meeting of foreign ministers, Wadephul was forced to cancel the trip late Friday. A last-ditch attempt to save face and limit the political damage. Perhaps Wadephul should have copied his predecessor Annalena Baerbock and focused on moral-philosophical escapism such as feminist foreign policy. It is harmless, fits the German zeitgeist, and would have earned him brownie points among left-leaning coalition partners. The Giant’s Achilles Heel Right now, Europe would desperately need a delegation that positions itself smartly in the slipstream of the Americans. Every giant has a weakness. China’s economy is caught in a self-reinforcing deflationary spiral triggered by draconian U.S. tariffs and a long-festering property crisis caused by massive state-driven capital misallocation. Deflation is fatal because China’s growth relies on the fiat-credit machine. Rising insolvencies mean shrinking loan books. The credit turbo sputters, collateral values collapse through fire sales and oversupply, especially in real estate. Then the state must intervene again, inject more government credit and weaken its currency further. It is a vicious cycle gripping nearly every modern economy. China’s answer has always been the same: a colossal export-subsidy engine, a mercantilist model built at the expense of trade partners who lost production capacity to China. Beijing’s trade surplus accounts for roughly 1 percent of global GDP. Roughly 1 trillion U.S. dollars, fueled by massive export aid. On top of that come geopolitical Trojan horses like the Belt and Road Initiative, opening markets wherever China needs raw materials. China Is Desperate for Replacement Markets Europe’s internal market has become essential for Beijing to dump excess production. The U.S. market is increasingly blocked since Donald Trump’s tariff offensive: Chinese exports to the United States have crashed by a staggering 27 percent. At the same time, Chinese exports to Germany rose 10.7 percent in the first half of the year. To prevent a labor-market meltdown at home, Beijing is flooding alternative markets with overcapacity. The Communist Party is facing a youth unemployment rate likely around 20 percent. The social explosive lies right there. This is precisely where Europe -- especially Berlin -- could apply leverage. In the escalating struggle for rare earth access, crucial for German industry and especially automakers, Europe could build real bargaining power by teaming up with the United States. Irresponsible and Stubborn It is irresponsible, considering China’s 90-percent dominance in rare-earth refining, not to side with Washington and secure strategic advantages for Europe’s own industrial survival. Ideologically rigid, strategically naive and severely weakened by its trade debacles with the U.S., EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen is stumbling from one pseudo-summit to the next like a dethroned Brussels queen. One gets the impression that the entire climate circus, the theatrical solidarity on Ukraine and the delusional green posture have become a psychological overcompensation for the visible failure of the Brussels project. Time to Seek Alliance with the United States Europe should have embraced geopolitical division of labor with Washington from the start. Especially now that the U.S., under a hyperactive foreign-policy president, is openly claiming leadership. Trump is right to point at EU protectionism, ubiquitous climate regulation and a policy increasingly hostile to markets. Washington is on the offensive: deregulation, tax cuts, junking the quasi-religious climate cult. It’s working: the U.S. economy is growing 3.8 percent, new debt fell from 6.7 to 5.8 percent. Trump is recalibrating the system while Europe tumbles in the opposite direction: higher debt, deeper recession. Wadephul and his fellow European diplomats must finally accept this reality and drop their escalating crusade over censorship laws, scrap the Digital Services Act, the Digital Markets Act and the online-surveillance regime entirely. Instead, they should seek fair trade with the U.S. without hidden climate protectionism. Europe is resource-poor and energy-dependent, importing up to 60 percent of its energy. Without Russian energy and raw materials, Europe’s prosperity model collapses. And the attack on a Eurasian rapprochement between continental Europe and resource-rich Russia did not come from Washington, despite media mantras to the contrary. It came straight from the heart of the European Union. Image: AT via Magic Studio Germany’s dramatic economic collapse is dragging its geopolitical standing down with it.
