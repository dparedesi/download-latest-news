The candidacy of BlackRock’s Rick Rieder to be the next Federal Reserve chair has gained late momentum, people familiar with the matter say, as President Donald Trump weighs congressional blowback in his bid to put a friendlier face at the head of the central bank. Trump’s interview Thursday with Rieder went well, the people said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the private deliberations. Key senators such as Republican Banking Committee member Thom Tillis have warned that Trump’s Fed picks will get more scrutiny after the Justice Department subpoenaed the Fed last week over statements by Chair Jerome Powell related to a renovation project at the bank’s headquarters. But Powell, whose term expires in May, contends the criminal probe is a pretext to punish him for not cutting rates quickly enough.

The search is now a four-man race, some of the people said, among Rieder, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, Fed Governor Christopher Waller and former governor Kevin Warsh, the people said. Read More: The Turbulent Forces Reshaping The Fed This Year Hassett was an early frontrunner and continued to be until Trump said this week he may not want to lose Hassett from his current role. It’s not clear if it was a signal of a shifting internal deliberation, or an offhand remark. “Nobody knows who President Trump will choose for the Fed, except President Trump himself. As the president recently said, he will announce his final decision soon,” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a written statement Saturday. The decision to subpoena the Fed a week ago sparked a wave of backlash, including a pledge by Tillis — who sits on the committee that would first consider a nominee — to oppose any Fed nomination until the matter is resolved. Rieder, BlackRock’s chief investment officer of global fixed income, is viewed as potentially easier to confirm, some of the people said. A spokesperson for BlackRock declined to comment on Rieder’s status. Hiring data released earlier this month suggested the labor market remained fragile at the end of the year, and the outlook for hiring is guarded. Economists see another year of limited job opportunities and cooling pay gains, likely exacerbating voters’ affordability concerns going into this year’s midterm elections. Fed officials cut rates three consecutive times at the end of 2025, but have signaled they’re in no rush to lower them again until they see more data on inflation and the labor market. Policymakers are expected to hold rates steady at their next meeting on Jan. 27-28. Rieder has called the Fed’s independence “critical,” but has also echoed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent in saying the central bank could be more “innovative” in how it uses its balance sheet.

Title: The world's rich and powerful are descending on Davos — and many are coming by private jet

Private jets are descending on the typically quiet ski town of Davos as the masters of the universe make their way to Switzerland for the World Economic Forum. Bill Gates, Nvidia's Jensen Huang, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, and JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon are among the business leaders scheduled to attend, along with world leaders like French President Emmanuel Macron, Argentina's Javier Milei, and Donald Trump. It's unlikely any of these titans will fly commercial. Last year, private aviation traffic in the region during WEF week was about five times the usual level, with more than 150 jets landing at area airports, according to JetSpy, which tracks FAA-registered aircraft. They were registered to billionaires like Michael Dell and Robert Smith, and hailed from Palm Beach and Dubai, Paris, and Doha. This weekend, corporate jets owned by Google, BlackRock, and IBM were among those that arrived in the area, according to data from JetSpy. Few WEF attendees will fly into Engadin Airport, the airport closest to Davos and the highest in Europe by altitude. "For many years, the WEF week has actually been one of the quietest weeks of the winter season for us," Christian Gorfer, the airport's chief financial officer, told Business Insider in an email. Due to airspace restrictions within a 25 nautical mile radius of Davos, all flights to and from Engadin require prior authorisation from the Swiss Air Force. "Some of our regular customers do fly in and out during that week, but WEF participants generally do not make their way to [Engadin]," Gorfer said. Instead, many private jets and government airplanes will arrive at the Zurich Airport alongside regular airlines. It's about a two-hour drive away from the Alpine town, but the wealthiest people will travel by helicopter instead. The airport estimated there will be an extra 1,000 takeoffs and landings during the conference, with some landing after its typically strict curfew of 11:30 p.m. Zurich Airport is also extending the opening hours for an observation deck for planespotters and other aviation enthusiasts. Others fly into Germany's Friedrichshafen Airport, a Jetspy spokesperson told Business Insider. The jets will be a parade of some of the most expensive on the market. Many opt for the Gulfstream G650, which costs tens of millions and was the transport of choice for attendees like Gates, Louis Bacon, and executives from BlackRock and Goldman Sachs last year. Others fly on the Bombardier Global 7500, which has been dubbed the "Ferrari of the Skies." Jump to

Title: The Panama Canal proves one lesson America needs now: never quit

Fox News correspondent Griff Jenkins unpacks which nations have control of the Panama Canal on ‘Special Report.’ I grew up in Windsor Locks, Connecticut. Our town’s name described what made us unique — we had locks on the Connecticut River. Ever since I was a kid, I have understood how locks worked, and I always wanted to see the ones that changed the world. Recently, I had that opportunity when I transited the Panama Canal. To see the locks operate just as they have for more than 110 years was thrilling. Traveling the almost 50-mile journey from the Pacific to the Atlantic was an experience I’ll never forget. The construction of the canal was the largest and most expensive project ever undertaken at that point in human history. Nothing so massive, elaborate or systematic had ever been attempted before. The financial cost, combined with the human toll of more than 25,000 lives lost, was comparable to a war. BLACKROCK INKS $23B DEAL FOR PANAMA CANAL PORTS Such a monumental achievement could never have happened without determination, perseverance, persistence and grit. The result changed the world and the global economy forever. The canal cut the distance from the Atlantic to the Pacific by 8,000 miles, resulting in three fewer weeks of travel time. Today, ships carrying as many as 11,000 containers transit through the canal. Cars, appliances and an array of other goods make their way across the world thanks to the more than 13,000 to 14,000 ships that use the Panama Canal each year. But the journey to a mid-continental canal was a long one, filled with crushed dreams, financial ruin, enormous adversity — and ultimate triumph. The French were the first to attempt building the canal. Ferdinand de Lesseps had built the Suez Canal and was certain he could build the Panama Canal too. The French created a private company to do it. They sold shares in multiple rounds of investment. Huge sums of money were raised and spent. After almost a decade of work, they quit and accepted defeat. Ferdinand de Lesseps insisted on a sea-level canal instead of one with locks, even though the two oceans have different sea levels, with tides rising 20 feet on the Pacific side but only three feet on the Atlantic. That decision was the single greatest factor in the project’s failure. BUILDING THE PANAMA CANAL: HOW TEDDY ROOSEVELT’S ALL-AMERICAN VISION MADE HISTORY More than 20,000 workers died, most from yellow fever and malaria. He would later admit that Panama was 10 times more difficult than Suez. Most unfortunate were the more than 800,000 French men and women who had invested in the project. The savings of entire families were gone. People lost everything. It was the largest and most significant financial collapse on record — a historic failure. Panama Canal lock's gates opening. (Danuta Hamlin) A decade later, America chose to build the Panama Canal. President Theodore Roosevelt asked the U.S. Senate to choose either Panama or Nicaragua for the canal. Even though a Nicaragua canal would be 135 miles longer, require more locks, and be more expensive to operate, it was the favorite. But after 14 days of debate, Panama won by a mere eight votes. America would pursue the seemingly impossible task of building the Panama Canal. It would require cutting through a jungle filled with ferocious animals, snakes and tarantulas — and carving through the sheer rock of the Continental Divide. US, PANAMA ‘TAKING BACK’ CANAL FROM ‘CHINA'S INFLUENCE,’ SAYS HEGSETH Roosevelt tapped John Wallace as chief engineer. He lasted only a year, overwhelmed by the monumental task, a brutal climate and the fear of yellow fever and malaria. John Stevens took over and proposed a lake-and-lock plan. The Panama Canal is not a simple passageway. It uses three locks to lift ships up to travel through the man-made Gatun Lake, then three more locks to lower them back down to another canal. Stevens also tasked chief Army physician William Gorgas with successfully eradicating yellow fever. But Stevens resigned three years later with no explanation.

He brought a military mindset to the work, but the demanding conditions remained. The rainy season lasts eight months in Panama, with 120 inches of annual rainfall, resulting in flooding and mudslides. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Heat and humidity were oppressive. At the bottom of Culebra Cut, the midday temperature was seldom less than 100 degrees — and often reached 120 to 130 degrees. On a typical day, more than 300 rock drills were in use, along with steam shovels and dynamite blasts. The noise was deafening and could be heard for miles. Though yellow fever and malaria were eradicated, death was omnipresent. Men were struck by flying rocks, crushed by machines or blown to bits by dynamite. More than 5,000 men died during the American construction. It was an incredible test of human endurance. But on Aug. 15, 1914, the canal opened for business — miraculously under budget and six months ahead of schedule. It was the culmination of a dream and more than 20 years of phenomenal effort and perseverance. This new year, you can see the impossible become possible in your own life — if you practice the same persistence and determination. As the English preacher Charles Spurgeon once said, "By persistence the snail reached the ark." ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER, ON NEW YEAR'S DAY, SHARES 'THE ONLY THING THAT WORKS' WHEN IT COMES TO ACHIEVING GOALS This could be the year you stick with it — no more quitting or giving up. No more excuses for why it can’t be done or is simply too difficult. The canal went from a dream to reality through grit and determination, through consistent progress in a singular direction. Panama Canal locks. (Danuta Hamlin) Maybe you are disappointed with the pace of your progress or the rate of your accomplishments. You may wish you were further along than you are. It takes time for the work to be done in our lives. It often takes longer than we expect. We can get frustrated at the slow pace of growth and wish for more. But if you have perseverance and endurance, you can see your dream become reality. You may lack money, ability or resources, but a million dollars’ worth of determination will get it done. There may be setbacks this year. Illness strikes. Loss hits. Relationships end. Time and again, in the building of the canal, there were setbacks that required restructuring. You, too, must regroup and continue your journey. Despite the failures, you must choose to persevere through disappointment and pain. CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP You can hang on far longer than you think. You may believe you can’t do it anymore. It’s hard. It’s challenging. But so was building the canal — and they overcame. You can too. Sometimes the toughest moment comes right before the breakthrough.

According to the World Economic Forum’s Report released January 2026, the upcoming meeting on the 18th will highlight instability via: Geoeconomic confrontation, state-based armed conflict, extreme weather events, and societal polarization. Economic risks are intensifying and will do so over the next two to ten years. In contrast to White House disinformation, an economic downturn and inflation are top tier. “An economic reckoning explores how, over the next two years, mounting debt sustainability concerns coupled with potential economic bubbles – in a context of rising Geoeconomic confrontation – could herald a new phase of volatility, potentially further destabilizing societies and businesses.” The Ten-Year outlook focuses on extreme weather events, biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse, critical change to earth systems. Magnetic North. The Two-Year outlook focuses mainly on Geoeconomic confrontation, societal polarization and extreme weather events.

Русский, Español, 中文, Portugues, Français, عربي, Hebrew, Deutsch, Farsi, Italiano, 日本語, 한국어, Türkçe, Српски. And 40 more languages. Geoeconomic confrontation involves such actions as tariffs, sanctions, weaponization against economic rivals as the triggers which could collapse society. Societal polarization refers to distrust in institutions, extreme societal division, and divergent sets of ‘facts’. Extreme weather could be the result of weather manipulation wherein natural systems are broken down causing extremes. However, the run of magnetic north southward is definitely in play as a natural event. Oddly, Trump is accelerating all the two- and ten-year events with instructions from the Deep State Kabbalah. How will he address these at a podium in Davos will be an interesting insight into the who, what, where and how. The latest addition to ‘mounting debt’ is Trump offering Greenland $700 billion. Without authorization of the Congress, or The People. Unconstitutional. According to Debt Clock, the countries with the lowest debt to GDP include: Russia, Ireland, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Taiwan and Turkey. All within the Eastern Hemisphere. When realizing and analyzing the global actions, the World Economic Forum Agenda, the Trump effect, the overriding question is “WHY?” We are all privy to the reality that this is all contrived. It is not coincidental. Not evolutionary. It is a created failure of the American empire, which will ripple through global economies like a ball barring hitting the Empire State Building! The ’why’ is almost as obscure as asking why don’t humans see the entire color spectrum? Why would God limit our sight and hearing? Why do we exist? Why doesn’t ANY government acknowledge UFO’s? They have been around for thousands of years. Depicted in cave art, the Minoan culture, the Aztecs, etc. In order to know and understand the WHY of the Kabbalah’s design of destruction, we would have to understand their souls, their hearts, their minds – which would likely drive a sane man to insanity. To know them, one would have to become like them. And it appears, Trump has always been a deceiver. JD Vance is considered par to worse than Trump. Graham is their openly evil jester. He speaks what they don’t say and jumps for joy at any chance to murder large swathes of humans. To understand – would mean to be like Graham. Under co-chairs Larry Fink (BlackRock) and Andre Hoffman (la Roche), the World Economic Forum has expanded quite exponentially adding 11 distinct ‘Centres’ to its foray into world domination. These Centres would operate as agencies within the context of the sphere and include cybersecurity, AI, manufacturing, energy, tech, financial & monetary, trade and the crème de la crème – Centre for The New Economy and Society! It is billed as a platform for leaders to build prosperous, resilient and inclusive societies that create opportunities for all. Heavily weighted companies associated with this Centre include the US, UAE, Netherlands, India and the UK. See this. In order to build anew, one must first destroy the entirety of the old. Much like razing Gaza but on a global level. It means a hell of a lot of people will die in order to rearrange the deck chairs. It reads like a blueprint of a monarchy. The leaders and stakeholders will need to assure a viable talented working class to create and build these initiatives because bankers and politicians don’t have skillsets. As such, they are more than willing to task education facilities to ‘re-skill via the “Revolution initiative.” In 1976, the movie Logan’s Run revealed such a society whereby productivity was considered to decline as of the age of 30 – therefore everyone attaining the age of 30 must commit their duty to be gassed – voluntarily. I see this sort of energy in the WEF’s new website Initiative for the New Economy and Society. This will be accomplished thru the Initiative — The Global Gender Parity Sprint. Without this initiative, it will take 123 years to close the gender gap. Acceleration is necessary. The means? * Click the share button below to email/forward this article.

Title: World Economic Forum Braces for Donald Trump's Return to Davos

U.S. President Donald Trump will attend the World Economic Forum (WEF) annual gathering in Davos, Switzerland, this week as he continues to challenge the established world order with a series of geopolitical victories and the promise of more to come. Since returning to the White House the president has withdrawn from numerous wasteful and unaccountable international organizations, including the U.N. climate treaty, captured Venezuela’s socialist dictator Nicolas Maduro following an attack on the capital Caracas and is now looking to annex Greenland. He has also challenged members of the NATO alliance to step up and start paying their way without relying so much on U.S. taxpayer dollars. Trump will be joined this year by more than 60 heads of state and government at the snowy confab of corporate and cultural elites. Among them are Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, Argentinian President Javier Milei, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, China’s Vice Premier He Lifeng, Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Israeli President Isaac Herzog, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and Syrian leader Ahmad al-Sharaa. DW reports Trump is leading the largest U.S. delegation ever to Davos, comprising five cabinet secretaries and other senior officials. Final preparations are underway in Davos as the town gets ready to welcome guests for the World Economic Forum on January 17, 2026 in Switzerland. The annual meeting brings together leaders from government, business and civil society to discuss major global issues. (Elena Romanova/Getty) The delegation includes Secretary of State Marco Rubio, special envoy Steve ​Witkoff and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, setting the stage for high-profile discussions on Ukraine, Venezuela, Gaza and Iran, where eyewitnesses have reported a brutal crackdown on anti-government protests, DW notes before continuing: Trump is expected to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Kyiv’s G7 allies — including leaders from Germany, Italy, France, the UK, Canada and the European Commission president — on the sidelines of the main event to seek US backing for security guarantees for Ukraine after a possible peace agreement with Russia, the Financial Times reported. The strong U.S. presence would be complemented by the first-ever “USA House” — a venue housed in a small church on the town’s main Promenade street, where US officials will host events and network with investors. Added to the list is California Governor Gavin Newsom, a determined Trump foe slated to speak one day after the president’s address. “Trump’s economic agenda betrays our nation: it is not ‘America First’ but ‘Trump First’ — rewarding the favored, punishing the dissenters, and burdening the rest,” Newsom said in a statement as reported by Politico. “At the World Economic Forum, I will forcefully confront these abuses and resolutely defend the principles to which California owes its economic strength: disciplined governance, world-leading universities, boundless innovation, and an open embrace of global cultures. This year’s meeting would be the first without WEF founder Klaus Schwab at the helm after he stepped down last year. Schwab has been succeeded by interim co-chairs Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, and Andre Hoffmann, vice chair of Swiss pharmaceuticals company Roche Holdings. President Trump will front the gathering in person on Wednesday after last year making his address remotely via via videostream. Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.

Title: More than 600 gardaí injured in line of duty last year
URL: https://www.rte.ie/news/ireland/2026/0118/1553724-garda-injuries/
Time Published: 2026-01-18T12:01:21Z
Full Content:
More than 600 gardaí were injured in the line of duty last year with more than half sustaining an injury as a result of an assault. New figures released under Freedom of Information legislation show that the number of gardaí injured at work during 2025 rose by 11% compared to the previous year. A total of 616 officers were recorded reporting some form of work-related injury last year - up from 555 in 2024. The figures include 344 gardaí who sustained injuries as the result of an assault - 56% of all injuries incurred in the line of duty. Among high-profile incidents in which gardaí were assaulted during the year were riots outside the Citywest complex in Saggart, Co Dublin in October as well as three separate incidents over a weekend in Dungarvan, Co Waterford in the same month when seven gardaí were injured. The second most common source of injury for gardaí in 2025 after assault were injuries from slips, trips and/or falls which resulted in injuries to 87 officers, followed by road traffic collisions which injured 78 gardaí. The figures show 41 gardaí suffered injuries like sprains or broken bones as a result of what is classified as "body movement", while 17 gardaí were injured from some form of contact with an animal including dog bites. Another 24 were injured from contact with something either sharp, rough or pointed and another ten suffered either a needle stick injury, a stab wound or exposure to a body fluid. The figures also reveal that 16 gardaí sustained injuries while based at the Garda College in Templemore, Co Tipperary, with approximately two-thirds of incidents at the training facility associated with slips, trips or falls. Another 15 injuries were reported among staff working at Garda HQ in Phoenix Park in Dublin. A total of eight members of the Garda Special Tactics and Operations Command were injured during 2025 including three who were assaulted. The overall level of injuries equates to around 4% of the 14,200-plus available force suffering some type of harm in the course of their work in 2025 – or one in every 25 gardaí. However, the rate can vary significantly around the country with 7% of gardaí in three garda divisions - Galway, Kerry and Wexford/Wicklow - being injured at work last year. The most number of gardaí injured in the line of duty in any of the 21 garda divisions last year was Galway with 43 out of a total workforce of 616, including 36 members who were assaulted. In contrast, the injury rate was as low as 2% in the Dublin East region, which covers areas including Blackrock, Dún Laoghaire and Dundrum, where just seven out of 377 gardaí reported a work-related injury. The Kerry division with a smaller workforce of 348 recorded more than three times that number with 25 officers being injured on duty - although the figure was a decrease on the 41 gardaí injured in Kerry in 2024. On taking up his appointment last September, Garda Commissioner Justin Kelly said the safety of gardaí was "of utmost importance and concern" for An Garda Síochána. Mr Kelly subsequently authorised the introduction of tasers for frontline gardaí on a pilot basis while the wearing of body cameras is to be unrolled nationwide among frontline staff too as measures aimed at reducing the level of injuries to gardaí. In November 2023, the government increased the maximum sentence for assaulting or threatening to assault a garda or any other on-duty emergency worker from seven to 12 years. © RTÉ 2026.

Title: Climate funding: Why PSUs are stepping in where VCs fear to tread

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. New Delhi: Neiox Eco Cycle isn’t the sort of startup you read about every day. It isn’t solving for fashion, food or grocery delivery. Rather, it is in the business of ship hulls—specifically, it is developing carbon-negative, non-toxic marine coatings for the undersides of marine vessels. There is nothing sexy about the business, which has to solve for plankton, barnacles, mussels and other such delights. It’s also not the sort of business that attracts much interest from venture capitalists (VCs), who generally prefer to focus on consumer-facing or software-as-a-service (SaaS) businesses. Despite this, Neiox Eco Cycle, founded by Akhil Raj Pottekkat, was able to obtain a tiny amount of funding in November 2024. The money didn’t come from a VC, but from Cochin Shipyard, which invested ₹30 lakh in the Kerala-based climate-tech startup. Last October, the shipbuilder followed that up with an additional ₹75 lakh investment under its maritime innovation programme. Neiox isn’t the only startup to receive backing from an unlikely investor. In November, Mahanagar Gas Ltd (MGL) invested ₹120 crore in Bengaluru-based electric vehicle (EV) startup 3ev, which builds electric cargo vehicles and battery infrastructure, for a 30.97% stake. That same month, Varaha, a climate-tech startup, received an infusion of $30.5 million from Mirova, the sustainable investing arm of French financial group Natixis. Other examples include Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd (HPCL) backing early-stage climate technologies through its Udgam innovation platform, including a ₹35-crore investment in Maraal Aerospace, which builds long-range solar-powered drones, and Oil India Ltd backing carbon and materials innovation through investments in startups such as Caliche and Carbonation India in 2025. These investments may appear disparate and unrelated on the surface. But together, they epitomize a gradual shift in how climate innovation is being funded, driven less by rapid exits and more by patient capital. India’s climate-tech story is increasingly being written by these unlikely financiers—legacy institutions, public sector firms and global capital are stepping in where venture capital has feared to tread. To be sure, these are mostly very small investments. But, like a mustard seed, the investors hope, these infusions, made with an eye on the future, will germinate into something huge. Rather than near-term returns, they are hedging against regulatory risk, future demand shifts and operational disruptions. “The traditional VC model is built for high-risk, hyper-growth businesses, while most climate technologies require patient capital and long gestation periods. That mismatch is why legacy firms, public sector undertakings (PSUs) and global investors are stepping in—they’re investing to hedge transition risk and build relevance, not to chase fast exits," said Rajan Mehta, founder, Climate Ventures Partner. This quiet realignment is unfolding against a paradoxical backdrop. India has seen 642 climate-tech startups founded in the last three years, and 492 have raised funding over that period. Yet only 61 have reached Series B or later, while 678 have shut shop since January 2023, according to data from Tracxn. What lies beneathIn shipping, what keeps a vessel afloat and profitable is often what lies unseen beneath the waterline. The hull—the lower portion of a vessel, which remains submerged—is its most critical and vulnerable component. Constant exposure to seawater and microscopic marine organisms make it prone to corrosion. Unlike engines or other mechanical systems that are routinely overhauled, hull quality largely determines a ship’s long-term value. Vessels are typically taken out of service every five years for dry docking, where hulls are inspected, repaired and repainted. View Full Image Globally, the shipping sector has pledged to reach net-zero greenhouse-gas emissions by around 2050. Current systems require the application of multiple layers—often as many as seven—with separate coatings used to prevent corrosion and to reduce biofouling (accumulation of biowaste such as barnacles on the hull). The accumulation of marine organisms on a ship’s hull increases drag, forcing vessels to burn more fuel to maintain speed, increasing emissions—most vessels still run on highly polluting fuels derived from crude oil. Existing anti-fouling paints by and large rely on biocides that kill marine organisms—an approach increasingly being frowned on by European environmental rules. For shipbuilders and repair yards, coatings are thus an unglamorous but decisive variable, shaping operating economics and emissions over decades. For ship owners, every day that a vessel sits in dock translates into idle time and lost revenue. Globally, marine hull coatings are dominated by a small club of companies such as Jotun, Hempel and Nippon Paint. These multinationals control licensing, class approvals and defence-grade specifications. While some manufacture in India, there is no Indian-origin company with an internationally approved marine coating. That gap is what drew Cochin Shipyard, India’s largest state-run shipbuilder, to back Neiox Eco Cycle. The startup upcycles industrial air pollutants into an advanced additive that can be integrated into marine paint and applied directly to ship hulls. It thus turns waste into a functional input for one of shipping’s most consequential, if least visible, layers, said Neiox’s Pottekkat. View Full Image Akhil Raj Pottekkat, founder, Neiox Eco Cycle. Neiox is positioning itself not just as a domestic alternative, but as a regulation-compliant challenger offering non-toxic, carbon-negative coatings. The company claims its technology collapses the seven-layer coating stack into a single, non-toxic application that tackles both corrosion and biofouling—cutting downtime, fuel loss and environmental risk in one stroke. For Cochin Shipyard, it checks several boxes at once. “Risk-adjusted technology exposure is often the priority (for investors such as Cochin Shipyard): small grants help create an early pipeline of tested solutions that could become relevant to future operations without committing large balance-sheet capital upfront," said Sumanta Biswas, assistant director at CUTS International, a policy research and advocacy group. Compliance with green norms is another imperative for Cochin Shipyard. Globally, the shipping sector has pledged to reach net-zero greenhouse-gas emissions by around 2050 under a revised strategy adopted by the International Maritime Organization, with interim emissions reduction targets set for 2030 and 2040. Beyond gasIn Mumbai, MGL, a stodgy, listed city gas utility. was led by the same rationale to invest in 3ev. The startup offers aftermarket services such as battery-as-a-service (BaaS), where it plans to deploy a bulk of the ₹120 crore funding from MGL, given that batteries are the most critical and fastest-degrading component in commercial EVs, making uptime, replacement and life-cycle management central to fleet economics. During its earnings call for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025-26, MGL’s management struck a careful tone: EVs, it said, are unlikely to dent compressed natural gas (CNG) demand in the near term. Yet, in the same breath, the company acknowledged investments such as 3ev as part of exploring adjacent energy transition opportunities, describing it as a long-term equity bet with limited near-term financial impact. “Mahanagar Gas’s management was actively analysing the transition to electric mobility—what it would mean for gas distribution, transportation demand… It wasn’t just an internal discussion; investors and analysts were asking the same questions," said Peter Voelkner, managing director of 3ev. View Full Image Peter Voelkner, managing director, 3ev. The move marks MGL’s first meaningful step into EV operations, though the company had earlier dipped its toe into e-mobility, including EV charging infrastructure, in collaboration with Tata Power in 2019. More recently, MGL acquired a 44% equity stake in International Battery Company India last February. “MGL’s earlier engagement with Tata Power in 2019 on EV charging infrastructure was part of nascent sector exploration. Its lead investment in 3ev represents a meaningful escalation, transitioning from collaborative pilots to capital commitments in core EV value-chain companies," said Biswas. 3ev is currently piggybacking on MGL’s footprint in Mumbai, with pilot projects placing fast-charging infrastructure at the utility’s CNG filling stations. Beyond Mumbai, the company operates independently in Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Chennai and Coimbatore. The green imperativeIf utilities and shipyards are making cautious, balance-sheet-light bets, global climate capital is moving with a different calculus. International investors and corporates, less constrained by domestic exit timelines, are increasingly backing Indian climate startups tackling longer-cycle problems such as carbon sequestration and regenerative agriculture—areas where traditional venture capital has been slow to commit. While Varaha is one example, other Indian climate-tech startups have also benefited. Arya.ag, which builds farm-gate infrastructure to reduce post-harvest losses, recently raised ₹725 crore in a Series D round led by GEF Capital Partners, a global private equity firm. “Global investors are greening their portfolios. Supporting climate projects in India helps them meet sustainability targets while accessing long-term growth," said Pradeep Singhvi, executive director, energy and climate practice, Grant Thornton Bharat, a management consultancy. Varaha’s model is simple: balance long-cycle carbon bets with faster climate and commercial returns. Flush with more than $42 million in funding, the startup last year struck a deal with Google, which agreed to purchase 100,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide removal credits from the Indian startup. A carbon removal agreement, or carbon purchase agreement (CPA), is a contract by which a company such as Google commits to buying future carbon dioxide removal credits from a supplier such as Varaha. It marked Google’s first carbon-removal agreement tied to a project in India and the largest involving biomass-based biochar—often dubbed “black gold" for soils. Varaha has since followed this up with another agreement with Microsoft last week, making it the tech company’s first carbon removal purchase in Asia. With biochar credits typically priced between $150 and $160 per tonne, a back-of-the-envelope calculation values these deals at roughly $16 million. So far, the New Delhi-based startup is the only Indian company to be listed on carbon removal standard and registry Puro.Earth. Prior to the recent infusion by Mirova, it had received funding from RTP Global, Japan’s Norinchukin Bank, Omnivore and Orios Venture Partners. Yet, interest from venture capital remains thin. Most climate-tech startups that have raised funding in India fall into adaptation-focused products—areas with clearer customers, shorter payback cycles and easier monetisation. Scale remains elusive across much of climate tech. There are around 800 viable climate-tech startups in India, but less than 3% have raised Series B or beyond. “Until carbon markets mature and pricing becomes predictable, many venture investors will remain cautious," said Singhvi. In India, venture capital funding has largely concentrated on EVs and mobility, where risks and timelines are better understood. Since 2022, roughly $6 billion has flowed into startups spanning electric vehicles, battery technology and related transition sectors, producing two mobility unicorns, Ola Electric and Ather Energy. Even so, scale remains elusive across much of climate tech. “There are around 800 viable climate-tech startups in India, but less than 3% have raised Series B or beyond—it’s a serious scaling gap," said Biswas. Large upfront capital needs, long regulatory lead times and dependence on government adoption “keep many VCs wary," he added. “Mitigation demands patient capital; adaptation offers short payback cycles and clearer business models." Total climate-tech funding fell to $657 million in 2025, down from $1.17 billion in 2024 and $1.5 billion in 2023, according to data from Tracxn. The decline has been driven largely by a sharp slowdown in EV mobility funding, which has more than halved since 2023. The contrast is sharper when set against the behaviour of large global financial institutions. In 2021, Larry Fink, chief executive of BlackRock, predicted the emergence of a new generation of climate unicorns—companies built around green hydrogen, agriculture, steel and cement rather than consumer internet. Four years on, that thesis has hardened into investment strategy. Large asset managers increasingly view climate risk as a material financial risk, not an environmental externality. BlackRock, alongside Temasek, has backed companies such as Antora Energy, which develops thermal batteries for industrial decarbonisation, and ConnectDER—signalling how private capital is gravitating toward climate infrastructure and industrial transition plays that sit beyond the comfort zone of traditional venture capital. For shipyards, utilities and global asset managers alike, climate technology is no longer an abstract ESG theme but a hedge against operational, regulatory and market risk. Whether venture capital eventually follows, or is permanently leapfrogged by patient capital with longer horizons, will shape not just how India decarbonises, but who gets to build and own that transition. In shipping, what keeps a vessel afloat and profitable is often what lies unseen beneath the waterline. The hull—the lower portion of a vessel, which remains submerged—is its most critical and vulnerable component. Constant exposure to seawater and microscopic marine organisms make it prone to corrosion. Unlike engines or other mechanical systems that are routinely overhauled, hull quality largely determines a ship’s long-term value. Vessels are typically taken out of service every five years for dry docking, where hulls are inspected, repaired and repainted. Current systems require the application of multiple layers—often as many as seven—with separate coatings used to prevent corrosion and to reduce biofouling (accumulation of biowaste such as barnacles on the hull). The accumulation of marine organisms on a ship’s hull increases drag, forcing vessels to burn more fuel to maintain speed, increasing emissions—most vessels still run on highly polluting fuels derived from crude oil. Existing anti-fouling paints by and large rely on biocides that kill marine organisms—an approach increasingly being frowned on by European environmental rules. For shipbuilders and repair yards, coatings are thus an unglamorous but decisive variable, shaping operating economics and emissions over decades. For ship owners, every day that a vessel sits in dock translates into idle time and lost revenue. Globally, marine hull coatings are dominated by a small club of companies such as Jotun, Hempel and Nippon Paint. These multinationals control licensing, class approvals and defence-grade specifications. While some manufacture in India, there is no Indian-origin company with an internationally approved marine coating. That gap is what drew Cochin Shipyard, India’s largest state-run shipbuilder, to back Neiox Eco Cycle.

Title: Davos invokes spirit of dialogue, despite bleak outlook

Full Content:
Tony Connelly Europe Editor Donald Trump's inauguration happened slap bang in the middle of last year’s World Economic Forum, his return to the White House both exciting US chief executives and worrying European leaders in equal measure. Addressing Davos invitees by videolink, the US President gave a flavour of what was to come: every global company should invest in America or face tariffs, NATO countries should spend 5% of GDP on defence, Ukraine was ready to do a peace deal, the EU had been ripping off the United States for years thanks to its trade surplus. The bitterest gripe about the EU was that it had thwarted the building of a fence at his golf links in Doonbeg, Co Clare (not true). Twelve months on, that teaser has not done justice to the wrecking ball Mr Trump has taken to global trade, to respect for territorial integrity and to presidential and legal norms. If Davos is the kumbaya citadel of global trade and togetherness, then it should represent everything MAGA hates: yet, Mr Trump is coming, with the biggest ever US delegation, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio and special envoy Steve Witkoff. Indeed, the World Economic Forum (WEF) looks like it is having a bumper year like no other, as if the collapse of normal trading relations and a rampant increase in threats to geopolitical stability have forced a displacement to the Swiss Alps out of sheer desperation. "There is historic record participation," says WEF Chief Executive Børge Brende. The truth may be more to do with changes at the top of the WEF hierarchy. For decades, the organisation’s founder Klaus Schwab was the ultimate grandee of the Davos set, cajoling the global elite to make the pilgrimage, and conducting interviews on stage in his gravely and heavily accented voice. Mr Schwab resigned in April last year, following an investigation into WEF’s workplace culture (he was later cleared by the board) and was replaced by Larry Fink, the chair and CEO of the US investment giant BlackRock. Mr Fink has turned out to be the ultimate powerbroker, reportedly singlehandedly convincing President Trump to return to Davos for the first time since 2019. He has managed to invite Jensen Huang, CEO and founder of the leading AI chip manufacturer NVIDIA (market capitalisation $5 trillion) who will make his first appearance. Mr Fink will also personally interview JPMorgan boss Jamie Dimon and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella on stage. Choppering and limo-ing their way to the ski resort will be more than 3,000 participants from 130 countries, including 64 heads of state or government (including six of the G7 leaders, and Taoiseach Micheál Martin), 1,700 business people, including 850 chief executives and chairs of leading companies. "We will have a hard look at Iran, Gaza, Ukraine, and also Latin America, and what we're seeing in Venezuela." There will be 60 ministers of finance, 30 trade ministers, more than 30 foreign ministers, and 15 EU commissioners, including Ireland’s Michael McGrath. The biggest ever delegations from the Gulf, China, Asia and Africa will also be descending on Davos. There will be 150 academics and heads of think-tanks, and 10 Nobel Prize winners. Yet, that sense of can-do collaboration to tackle global problems appears entirely at odds with the zeitgeist. The WEF’s annual global risks survey, published this week, noted that "geoeconomic confrontation" had moved to the top of the list of chief executive concerns, up eight places from last year, with just under a fifth saying economic rivalries were most likely to trigger a crisis this year. Armed conflict between states was ranked as the second-biggest threat (the survey was done before the United States attacked Venezuela, abducting President Maduro, and before Mr Trump declared he would take Greenland "the hard way" if need be). Undeterred, the WEF organisers believe the forum is needed more than ever, even when confronting the most acute crises. "We will have a hard look at Iran, Gaza, Ukraine, and also Latin America, and what we're seeing in Venezuela," Mr Brende told a pre-Davos briefing. While critics of the snowy love-in - with its weird cocktail of thought leaders, spiritual gurus, tech utopians, corporate billionaires, climate activists, trade union leaders and anti-poverty campaigners - question the merits (or even morality) of Davos, its defenders say it offers an unrivalled way of taking big-picture challenges and then throwing power, money and expertise at them. "At the core of the annual meeting programme is the notion that we operate in a new economic reality where geopolitics, exponential innovation, the concepts of economic, societal, environmental resilience are deeply intertwined, and they're also interacting with each other at a rapid clip," says WEF Managing Director Mirek Dušek. "We need to figure out how we are going to trade with each other in the future." Challenges broken down into themes This year’s challenges have been broken down into five themes: how to revive growth, geopolitical threats, AI innovation, how to invest in people and how to build resilience in the sphere of nature, water and climate. The schedule does not shy away from the harsh new realities of Trump world. Under the heading "How can we cooperate in a more contested world?" there are plenty of panel discussions on the threats to global trade, not least when tariffs are weaponised to boost domestic production and as a bargaining chip in great power geopolitics. Oil corporations are now being used as a blunt force weapon by the Trump administration in Venezuela, while sectors such as car-manufacturing, semi-conductors and pharmaceuticals are being more intimately tied to national, or even European Union sovereignty. "The heyday of globalisation is not coming back," The Economist notes in its Davos preview. "The future is likely to hold yet more state involvement. The allure of commercial riches motivated Mr Trump’s toppling of Nicolás Maduro in Venezuela and is guiding his efforts to secure a truce between Russia and Ukraine." Senior WEF figures are nothing if not optimistic (the forum’s slogan remains "Committed to Improving the State of the World", and this year’s theme is "A Spirit of Dialogue"). "We need to figure out how we are going to trade with each other in the future," says Mr Brende. "And we have seen that trade has been pretty resilient. Trade is like water. It finds its way. We collaborate differently than in the past. Is more bespoke, is more plurilateral, all this we will try to figure out in Davos." How or whether that fits in with Donald Trump’s current thinking is hard to say. For him, bespoke means divide and conquer, attempting to peel off the odd EU member state here or there with inducements, threatening other countries with eye-watering tariffs for reasons that have more to do with personal grudges than economic statecraft. His speech in Congress Hall on Wednesday afternoon will be closely watched. Having once again insulted Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky as being the "obstacle" to peace, there is still the chance that he will meet him in Davos (Kyiv has suggested both leaders could finalise a peace plan there). The Taoiseach is expected to hold bilateral meetings with senior political figures, including the Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Mustafa, as well as US tech chief executives. Nailing down his precise agenda is proving trickier than usual given the fear among corporate leaders about publicly consorting with non-US leaders in case they incur the wrath of President Trump. Despite that, IDA Ireland says they're expecting between 65 and 70 corporate leaders to attend their annual dinner in the Grischa Hotel on Wednesday evening with Micheál Martin. Last year the guest list tapered off to around 50 once it emerged that the Taoiseach was grounded in Dublin in order to form the new government. Sources suggest that this year there will be a healthy smattering of big names at the dinner, which will also be attended by Michael McGrath and Peter Burke, Minister for Enterprise, Tourism and Employment. WEF organisers, indeed, argue that the start of 2026 finds the global economy in a more resilient shape than had been predicted a year ago. Despite that, global debt and low growth remain stubborn concerns, while geopolitical fragmentation and asset bubbles continue to pose risks. As usual, there will be plenty of speakers cheerleading the potential for AI to boost growth and productivity, while also accelerating progress in scientific and health research, as well as green technology. "We’re hearing from business leaders that when it comes to the opportunity side of things, this goes well beyond artificial intelligence," says Saadia Zahidi, senior managing director of WEF. "There is opportunity when it comes to medical and healthcare services, particularly with changing demographics. There’s opportunity when it comes to advanced manufacturing, especially when that starts blending with Artificial Intelligence." But the big geopolitical crises of our time will be front and centre. European leaders will include Germany’s Friedrich Merz, French President Emmanuel Macron, Spain’s Pedro Sánchez, Finland’s Alexander Stubb, Polish President Karol Nawrocki and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte. They are likely to impress upon President Trump the need to rethink his designs on Greenland and instead restore his focus to ending the war in Ukraine. Whether or not he will listen is another matter. Either way, Davos 2026 promises to be the most keenly watched gathering ever. Europe Editor © RTÉ 2026.

Title: Malachy Clerkin: The All-Ireland club finals are precious because they are unique

Time Published: 2026-01-17T06:00:01Z
Full Content:
By far the best thing about the club finals is that they’re always unique. The mix always changes and the novelty always keeps the recipe fresh. Big clubs, small clubs, city clubs, parish clubs. Clubs that set out at the start of the year to win the All-Ireland, clubs that weren’t sure last summer if they had the beating of the hoors five miles out the road. On this weekend last year, Na Fianna supporters marched en masse from the closest club to Croke Park to take their seats for their day of days. The walk took no more than 15 minutes, assuming you didn’t get waylaid in Fagan’s halfway down. This time around, Dingle supporters have, if they’re lucky, a nine-hour round trip to make to HQ and back. With traffic, food and pit-stops, it’s probably closer to 11. Two more different clubs you couldn’t fathom. Club finals day makes kings of everyone, regardless. Dingle, from the farthest reaches of the Kerry coast. St Brigid’s from Kiltoom, a sort of sleeper parish on the Roscommon side of Athlone. Loughrea, from deep in Galway hurling country. Ballygunner, on the edge of Waterford city – or maybe that should be Waterford City on the edge of Ballygunner. That’s the foursome for 2025/26 and, like every foursome that has gone before it, it’s unique. This Sunday will see the 55th All-Ireland club hurling final followed by the 55th club football final and in all those years down through a half-century and more, never once has a line-up been duplicated. Plenty of clubs have made it back to Croke Park, some of them in alarmingly short order. But the same four teams have never shared a bill twice. Mostly, this is because repeat fixtures are so rare in either code. Ballyhale have played in more deciders than any other club in hurling or football. Yet in their 11 All-Ireland finals, they have met 11 different opponents. Same goes for Crossmaglen – seven football finals, seven different teams waiting on them when they got there. It does happen occasionally that clubs in the middle of a glorious run find their way back to meet each other. Nemo Rangers played Crossmolina in the 2001 and 2003 finals. In hurling, Birr and Dunloy ran into each other in the final twice in eight years, in 1995 and 2003. Close, but no cigar. Nemo also played two football finals against St Vincents, albeit they were a generation (or three) apart, in 2008 and 1973. And way back when, Blackrock of Cork and St Anne’s of Wexford faced off twice in three years for hurling finals in the early 1970s. But getting the two sides of the house to match up at the same time is all but impossible. There’s never been three clubs on the same bill twice, never mind four. The point is, there’s a recurrent magic to the club finals that is based solely on the fact that this day will almost certainly never happen again. The people of Dingle, Kiltoom, Ballygunner and Loughrea have never descended en masse to Croke Park before and the odds are minuscule that they ever will again. It all adds to the one-off feeling of it all. Down through the decades, 52 different hurling clubs have played in a final, while Dingle are the 54th football club to make it to the dance. In hurling, 28 clubs have been to one final in their history and have never made it back. In football, that number is 29. You better do it this weekend because it’s just so unlikely you’ll ever get the chance again. Little wonder, then, that Loughrea spent time and energy this week successfully appealing Cullen Killeen’s suspension. The Galway club knew two things. One, their only appearance in an All-Ireland final was 19 years ago. Two, Killeen is 19-years-old. This is literally a once-in-a-lifetime game so if there was a way to get him a place in it, they were duty-bound to try and find it. Denis Walsh: The GAA community has no stomach for strict enforcement of rules https://t.co/afv6wIo30s That’s the thing about the club finals. When they’re over, you slide all the way back to the bottom of the board. Neither of last year’s football finalists made it as far as their own county final this time around. Both hurling finalists won their county title but neither survived their first match in the provincial championships. So much has to fall into place for the journey to stay alive all the way to Croke Park. And so, each club lands into the club finals this weekend telling themselves stories that feel entirely their own but which are all really just versions of the same yarn. Here’s St Brigid’s, hellbent on avenging their last-kick defeat of 2024. Here’s Ballygunner, trying to replicate their last-puck win in their only final appearance in 2022. Here’s Loughrea, riding the wave of their first ever back-to-back Galway titles. Here’s Dingle, first-time winners of Munster, first-time All-Ireland finalists. Early on Friday, a clip did the rounds of a news report from 7News in Australia. It showed three of Mark O’Connor’s Geelong teammates pulling wheelie cases through Melbourne airport, on their way to Dublin to see if Dingle can win the All-Ireland club final. A trio of premiership Cats is jetting off to the other side of the globe to watch a teammate chase a lifelong dream. It's reignited calls for the return of the International Rules Series. @cleary_mitch @7AFL pic.twitter.com/WYmEaLbGb4 O’Connor’s just-one-more-boss journey through this club season has been such a glorious story, a poem to the power of love and roots and home. The unique pull of the club finals in action. A precious, precious thing.

Title: Have you any idea what this colourful fly is?

I spotted this very colourful fly in a garden centre outside Gorey some time ago. Have you any idea what it is? Michael Wade, Co Wexford This is the noonday fly – Mesembrina meridiana – which is most often seen on cow dung, sunbathing on trees, fences and walls in bright sunlight, or visiting flowers to feed on nectar. Eggs are laid in cow dung; the female lays a single egg in up to five cow pats. When they hatch the larvae are carnivorous and feed on other fly larvae within the dung. The female lays up to five eggs in a lifetime, each one in a different pat, at two-day intervals. Ruby (5), Robin (3) and Rossa (1) spotted this unusual looking fungus on a tree in Slieve Gullion Forest while visiting to give Robin’s dodies to the fairies. Robin bravely left her dodies behind, but we were wondering, what is it called and is this a fungus? Ruby, Robin and Rossa Dunworth, Blackrock, Co Louth The fairies may indeed prefer the dodies to this fungus, which is now called jelly ear or wood ear, although the Latin name Auricularia auricula-judae, remains unchanged. The ear-like fruit bodies, up to 9cm across, are tough and gelatinous when young but hard and brittle when dry and old. Larger specimens may have vein-like wrinkles on their surface, making them even more ear-like. The fungus grows on decaying wood of deciduous trees and shrubs but is most usually found on elder trees. It is widespread and common. I got off my bike to take a photo of a cormorant drying off beside the canal at Robert Emmet Bridge, Harold’s Cross. The canal is not perfectly clean but there are regular group clean-ups which help with the water quality. Róisin Sheerin, Dublin It’s hard to take a photo while riding a bike right enough. The Grand Canal has visual litter such as plastics, etc, but the water quality is good. There is enough dissolved oxygen in the water for invertebrates to thrive. These in turn are food for the fish, which are a main part of this cormorant’s diet. It used to be thought that the cormorant was drying its wings when it adopted this pose – even though it might actually be raining at the time – and the cormorant promptly dived back into the water after a short period, getting wet all over again. It is now thought that holding out their wings like this helps them to digest their recently swallowed prey. Our late friend, Mary Shackleton, gave me a present of this tree, which I suspect is unusual. It is now five metres tall and slender stemmed. What is it, please? JC Colgan, Leixlip, Co Kildare It is a poplar, a species of deciduous tree characterised by having long-stalked leaves which tremble in the slightest breeze, thus giving rise to its Irish name – an Crann creathach. This is not the native species Populus tremula (the aspen), however, which has round-toothed leaves. The leaves look more like those of the Black Italian poplar. Only males of this species are known, so see what kind of catkins grow on the tree in due course. We found this bug on the roof of our garage. We wondered, is it a kind of ladybird or another beetle? Emily (12) and Zachary (9) Freedman, Dublin Bugs are listening devices, or germs that give you the flu (unless you are speaking American). This insect is a very young adult seven-spot ladybird just recently emerged from its pupal stage. It emerges yellow and without the spots, which will appear within half a day.

Title: 25 ways to get off your screens: from analogue kits to freedom phones
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/life-style/people/2026/01/17/offline-activities-for-2026/
Time Published: 2026-01-17T06:00:00Z

Somewhat ironically, 2026 has been declared by online influencers as the year people will move their lives offline. Videos of people assembling “analogue bags” – essentially holdalls of entertainment to keep boredom at bay – have gone viral on Instagram and TikTok. People are swapping Spotify for radio, Kindles for books, and phone cameras for film. But behind the buzz is a widespread, real-world desire to return to a time before smartphones absorbed hours of every single day, before they were an extension of our bodies. There is a growing sentiment now that the way to thrive in our high-tech world is by living a low-tech life. Social media’s original promise was to enhance our lives and build community, to connect us with other people. Yet research shows the more time people spend on these platforms, the more likely they are to feel depressed and lonely. Australia’s recent ban on under-16s using social media platforms was a world-first policy designed to protect children from harm. It’s not only social media we are giving so much of our downtime to, but online shopping, gaming and random videos of random things. The internet is a never-ending supply of content, and more than 50 per cent of it is now AI generated. It can absorb so much of our attention that we can easily forget just how exciting life can be beyond our little screens. So lock away your phone, log out of Netflix and find inspiration in the ideas below to feed the mind, body and soul. Set yourself up by buying or borrowing a few items that will reduce the practical role of a smartphone in your life. Your lifestyle might require different things, but a good place to start is an alarm clock, so you can keep your phone out of your bedroom; a watch, so you can check the time without checking your phone; and a notebook, so you can jot things down to act on when you’re ready. Most things are a lot less urgent than they seem when the option to respond or act immediately isn’t there. The necessity of emails, maps and internet banking is enough to prevent many of us from making a permanent switch to a “dumb phone” that can’t connect to the internet. There are workarounds, such as removing all non-essential apps from your phone or installing controls to limit screen time. Another option is to procure an old phone, one that doesn’t have internet capabilities,. There are lots of options available for under €50, and you can get a pay-as-you-go SIM. Give the phone number to the people in your life who might need you in an emergency, or who you could call in one. Think of it as your freedom phone, the one in your pocket when you go hiking, or at the bottom of your bag when you go out with friends and just want to see where the day takes you, or when you’re cosied up at home and need a few hours or days of being entirely present with yourself and the people around you. [ No Instagram, Netflix or YouTube: Can I survive a four-week digital detox?Opens in new window ] Technology was supposed to streamline our lives, yet somehow it feels more complicated than ever. We stream music and movies, download books and save thousands of images in the cloud. But do we really own any of these things? If the internet went down, would you have anything to show for years of honing your tastes, curating and collecting? Is there a case for owning actual books, for printing out favourite photos, for finding an old Discman and listening to an album all the way through? The secret to getting back into reading is reading purely for pleasure. Page-turners, characters that stay with you, fiction or non-fiction that is so compelling you bring the book with you wherever you go. Conventionally seen as a solitary way to experience the world, reading can also be a social pursuit. “We have found that community and friendship flourish when phones are put away,” says Maeve O’Brien, co-founder of Silent Book Club Dublin, where people gather once a month in Mish Mash Café on Capel Street to read together. “While it can sometimes be difficult not to check your screen for an hour or two, we have found people start to crave it.” Taking photos with a dedicated camera rather than a phone camera might seem cumbersome, but it offers something different: a chance to slow down, look, engage and create. “Using a ‘real’ camera invites you into a more mindful, observational space where you’re not just capturing life but composing a story and creating art,” says Andrea Hunt, a photographer and tutor with the Dublin Photography School. “Many people are drawn to film photography out of curiosity or a sense of nostalgia. What often keeps them there, then, is the slower, more thoughtful way of working that it encourages. You begin to trust your eye, your understanding of light, and your own patience.” Ditch the notion that board games are only for the festive season, and instead embrace them as part of everyday life, as they have been for thousands of years, from ancient Egypt to ancient Rome. Nine Men’s Morris, a strategic board game, was so beloved by the 13th-century monks on retreat at Glendalough that it was found scratched into a flat piece of slate at the remote Temple-na-Skellig church, which is accessible only by boat. Today, charity shops are often a treasure trove for picking up a nostalgic family classic or discovering a new niche favourite. In an era where you can stream or rent almost any film instantly, going to see a movie on the silver screen retains a certain romantic quality. Cinema’s history in Ireland is storied; James Joyce first introduced cinema to Ireland in 1909 with the Volta Cinematograph Theatre on Dublin’s Mary Street. It was a short-lived venture for the writer, as Dubliners had a fairly muted reaction to his programme of European cinema. Alongside blockbuster cinemas, there are some beautiful independent options around the country with diverse programmes. Consider Dunamaise Arts Centre in Co Laois, The Dot Cinema, a tiny private cinema in Dublin 2, or Triskel Arts Centre in Cork. [ Top travel: the hottest destinations to visit in 2026Opens in new window ] Stitching, knitting, pottery throwing, printing – all manner of arts and crafts offer a chance to create rather than consume, to use your hands for flair and individuality. There is no need for perfection in the end product, but the very making and doing provides an antidote to the passive viewing of algorithmically curated content. “The tactile nature of embroidery makes it such a detox from scrolling,” says Alice Cummins, an embroiderer and tutor of the craft. “The repetitive motion of the needle and thread coming through the fabric. The “in-out-in-out” is almost like meditating. Obviously, you also get a beautiful piece of art out of it, too, but I think most people I know who stitch do it more for the process than the finished product.” One of the hooks that keeps many of us on social media is the promise of connection, with friends, strangers and potential work opportunities. Yet the number of hours spent scrolling in solitude versus the moments of actual fruitful connection does not work in our favour. Instead, try going to one in-person event a month – a talk, a lecture, a concert – and speaking to three people there. It’s fertile ground for real-world connections, based on shared experiences and interests. Learning a new language is arguably one of the most complex mental activities humans can do, but the rewards are great. It has been shown to boost memory, concentration and creativity, as well as improve communication skills and empathy. A recent study published in Nature Aging found that speaking multiple languages can slow brain ageing, the gradual decline in brain processing speed, attention and other cognitive functions. Immersion in the language is the way to maximise these benefits, so stay away from language apps on your phone. Try looking for an in-person class, or if you have a little Irish there’s likely a ciorcal comhrá, an Irish-language conversation group, in your area. As the saying goes, “Is fearr Gaeilge bhriste ná Béarla cliste”. [ Sí, oui, ja! You can learn a language late in lifeOpens in new window ] The extreme heat of a sauna makes it a perilous environment for technology and forces people to leave their phones behind. Fynn Cook, who owns the off-grid Sauna Shack in Co Tyrone, says he often hears phones pinging away in the changing space. “For once, those notifications don’t matter and can be ignored until later.” Without screens or distractions to take people out of the experience, saunas can become micro hubs of connection. “There is something about sharing conversations in a sauna that opens people up, allowing vulnerability and talking openly,” says Cook. [ Nude saunas in Ireland: ‘I realise I will soon be naked among these strangers’Opens in new window ] You don’t have to believe in a doomsday scenario to think it might be worthwhile to know how to look after yourself in the wild with no Google or ChatGPT to ask for help. There are overnight courses around Ireland where you can learn how to make fire from a spark using things such as birch bark, lichen or sap, how to sterilise stream water for drinking, and how to build a shelter. “It’s important for people to have these skills,” says Nathan Kingerlee, who runs Outdoors Ireland’s bushcraft and survival courses in Glengarriff, Co Cork. “Whether it’s for the simple enjoyment and therapeutic value of being able to head outdoors and sit beside your campfire listening to birdsong. Or the ability to survive off-grid for even a week, say in the event of a longer-term power cut or disaster, knowing you can also help and look after those around you.” Growing your own vegetables is a no-brainer if you have any space. It is cost-effective and fosters a deep appreciation of food and connection to the earth. “Any activity that forces you to be out in nature is going to have a positive impact on your mental health,” says Fergus Finlay, from Abercorn Farm in Greystones, Co Wicklow. Abercorn offers day-long courses on how to grow your own vegetables at home. “In a world of instant gratification, growing plants and vegetables is the complete opposite. It takes time, patience and care,” says Finlay. “It forces you to be fully focused on the now and what’s happening in front of you.” Go on a walk without a phone, a watch or music. Gen Z calls this absence of distraction “rawdogging”, and it’s seen as a test of endurance. It doesn’t need to be a punishment, though; it can be a time to connect to your natural surroundings. You could take note of the trees around you, see how many you can identify, and which ones mystify. Maybe learn a new one each day, so that nature is no longer one green and brown blur, but trees you know by name. Niall Mac Coitir’s book Ireland’s Trees: Myths, Legends and Folklore is the perfect accompaniment. Running as a sport is booming, with record numbers signing up for the 2026 Dublin and Cork city marathons. It’s cheap, accessible and delivers a boost of happy hormones as a reward for your efforts. Run alone or join one of the many run clubs around the country, like the Run for Palestine run club, which does a 5km loop every Sunday morning in Dublin. “The pace is very inclusive, enabling runners of all ages and abilities to come along,” says Ola Løkken Nordrum, who founded the group in 2024. “I’ve met so many brave, warm and inspirational people. It has become a space where people can come together and find strength in one another.” Somehow, cooking blogs have become part of the “enshittification” of the internet, the degradation of the online environment. Recipe websites are often so cluttered with ads and pop-ups that you’re constantly scrolling up and down. Cooking a recipe from a cookbook, on the other hand, can bring “comfort and relaxation”, says chef and bestselling author Cherie Denham. “A cookbook comes with heart and soul; a recipe from a Google search does not. I find they bring great comfort and relaxation, particularly at night-time. When I leaf through those pages, and gaze at those photos and read introductions to the recipes, it brings me to a happy place that a computer simply can’t.” [ ‘Stop saying yes’: Over 50 ways you can make your life easier in 2026Opens in new window ] There are just a few environments left in this world that are completely inhospitable to phones. Swimming pools are one of them. For child protection, phones, tablets and any device capable of photography are typically prohibited poolside. In the water, whether you’re floating, paddling or doing laps, there is total freedom from technology and from the outside world. Being in water is a chance to reset and recalibrate. Wild swimming has a similar appeal, a silky, salty release that is hard to find elsewhere. As Bonnie Tsui, the author of Why We Swim, observes, “You don’t have to be a great swimmer to appreciate the benefits of sensory solitude and the equilibrium the water can bring.” “Digital detox”, offgrid stays are on the rise, offering the opportunity for a real break and a real rest. In south Donegal, Lough Mardal Eco Lodge is one such tech and gadget-free zone. On entering, guests leave their devices in lockboxes in the lobby and “find themselves chatting to one another, rather than disappearing into their screens”, says Clare Tindal, who owns and runs Lough Mardal with her husband Marcus Tindal. “The natural environment draws us out of ourselves. You will feel your shoulders drop, your mind declutter and ultimately the immense relief to have separated yourself from your tech devices and their shallow stimulations.” Any practice where you give all of your attention to a single object or activity is a form of meditation. Research has shown that listening to live music during meditation may help focus an active mind, decrease heart rate, anxiety and pain, and guide you to a deeper relaxation. Taking all of this into account, musician Danny Forde created his piano meditation offering. He chooses cosy places in beautiful natural surroundings to play piano for groups, who can lie down and rest. “I like to call it ‘pure listening’, where you practice staying with each note as it’s played, without analysis or judgment,” Forde says. Improvised and beautiful, it is a soothing lullaby in a manic world and can be replicated at home with a CD or RTÉ’s LyricFM. The Artist’s Way is a cult book cum self-help course, passed between friends and creatives for three decades. Written by Julia Cameron, it has been credited by celebrities including Elizabeth Gilbert, Alicia Keys and Reese Witherspoon, alongside millions of others, for helping them rediscover and embrace their individual creative spark. Alongside different weekly exercises, Cameron asks that the first thing you do each morning on waking is write out three pages longhand. These are called Morning Pages. They are private, not to be shown to anyone. “There is no wrong way to do Morning Pages,” Cameron writes in The Artist’s Way, meaning you can write anything you like, nothing is too petty, too banal or too ambitious. It’s a way to start the day fresh, and although Cameron introduced the practice decades before the first smartphone, it can seamlessly replace the morning scroll. Music feeds our soul, and picking up a new instrument or rediscovering one long cast aside can be an entirely absorbing activity and open up many new doors. Rionach O’Callaghan, a retired teacher who took up the ukulele through a term of night classes in Blackrock Further Education in Dublin after the pandemic, says it lifts her spirits being able to play music in a group. “My youngest son played the ukulele when he was very small, and l always thought it sounded like a happy instrument. I played the piano in my youth, but l wanted to play an instrument that was portable and fun. Ukulele is both of these things. Playing it with a group lifts my spirits, and l try never to miss our weekly sessions or the parties.” Our time is the most valuable resource we have, so why not donate it and make a difference? The National Volunteering Database has thousands of varied opportunities across the country to get involved in, depending on your interests. There’s openings to plant native Irish trees with ReWild Wicklow, write letters to people in nursing homes, volunteer at Dublin Zoo, take part in a beach clean-up, become a court and forensic accompaniment volunteer, a driver for autism assistance dogs, or to join the Pachamama project to sew reusable period pads for girls in developing countries so they can stay in school or work. The pull of free-diving, where you dive in open water without oxygen, for many people is the opportunity for silence, to look inside yourself. It may sound extreme, but it’s building a following among swimmers and non-swimmers in Ireland. “It’s like you’re grounded and limitless at the same time,” says Julia Guziuk, who runs Freediving Aran off Inis Mór. “It’s meditation wrapped in adventure, a quiet space where the only ‘noise’ is your own mind and learning to soften that is very powerful.” Divers here can see cliff walls, kelp forests, soft corals, jellyfish and dolphins in this private slice of the Atlantic, which has depths of 20 to 30 metres for beginners to more experienced freedivers. There are more than 450 species of birds on Birdwatch Ireland’s list, and many are rare or unusual or migratory birds. Learning to identify even our most common garden birds deepens every experience of being outside. Hang a bird feeder in your garden or attach a suction feeder to your window and watch the birds come. If you want to level up your twitching, Birdwatch Ireland runs a citizen science survey open to everyone between December and February. By taking part, you can help provide information on how bird populations fare during the harsh winter months each year. One way to put pinging notifications into perspective is to look up, as far as the eye can see and farther still. Stars, planets and the mysteries of the cosmos can make the screens we spend so much time staring into seem dull. Ireland was once a leader in astronomical research, and for seven decades between 1845 and 1914, the observatory at Birr, Co Offaly, had the largest telescope in the world. Birr’s giant “Leviathan” telescope is no longer operational, but there are opportunities to stargaze through super-powerful telescopes at Ireland’s two other historical astronomical observatories at Dunsink Observatory, Dublin and Armagh Observatory, Armagh. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: XRP Social Interest Explodes To Rival The Likes Of Bitcoin – Details

XRP is in the center of crypto conversations, with social interest on X rising to levels that now rival Bitcoin. Recent data tracking the most searched cashtags on the platform shows XRP consistently appearing among the dominant assets drawing user attention. Interestingly, this surge in visibility is not happening in isolation but in tandem with a series of regulatory, institutional, and ecosystem developments within the XRP ecosystem. Data tracking the most-searched cashtags on the social media platform X shows XRP climbing alongside other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, a closer look at the data shows that XRP has received many more cashtags compared to other cryptocurrencies. This trend was revealed by Nikita Bier, head of product at X, who shared a visualization chart of recent search behavior on X. The chart data shows that XRP has consistently appeared among the most queried assets on X since December 2025. Throughout the period depicted, top cashtag traffic has been fluctuating with daily rhythm as X users scan the platform and post on X with cashtags. The share of searches attributable to $xrp slices into a larger portion of the total during days in early January 2026, which indicates extended interest. On some dates, XRP’s presence in the search mix rivals that of $btc and $eth, which are typically the dominant anchors of crypto attention on social media. The chart also shows how other tags wax and wane alongside XRP’s performance. Some days show greater fragmentation, where interest is spread across stocks such as $iren (IREN), $tesla (Tesla), $gme (GameStop), and $asts (AST SpaceMobile Inc.). Nonetheless, the trajectory for XRP in the first half of January shows a growing base of people actively getting involved in the cryptocurrency. Top Cashtags Searched On X Social interest on X is a mix of speculation and ecosystem developments, which XRP is currently sitting at the center of. Behind this spike in attention are tangible developments surrounding Ripple and the XRP ecosystem. One recent example is how Ripple secured regulatory approval from the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority, obtaining both an Electronic Money Institution license and cryptoasset registration. Ripple’s regulatory buildout is expanding across Europe, with additional approvals in Luxembourg as part of its push to operate on both sides of the continent. Interestingly, there are also indications of deeper engagement with Ripple’s ecosystem on the institutional side. Rumors and mentions on X indicate that BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has started to use Ripple’s USD-backed stablecoin (RLUSD) as collateral. However, this move is yet to be confirmed by BlackRock. These updates, combined with many others, help explain why social interest and cashtag searches for XRP have recently been on the rise on X and other social media platforms.

Title: Newly discovered JFK archive lands at De Búrca’s valued at €45,000

Former American president John F Kennedy remains a hugely iconic figure in the Irish imagination. Not just because of his Irish Catholic heritage, but also because he was the first sitting US president to visit Ireland in June 1963, a mere five months before he was assassinated in Dallas, Texas. For these reasons the newly discovered archive of signed letters, press photographs and an inscribed portrait of Kennedy, valued by De Búrca Rare Books at €45,000, should attract significant interest. “The material has remained intact and unseen on the open market until now, and is the biggest single archive of John K Kennedy we have put on the market,” says Will de Búrca. The privately owned collection – for sale now via the Blackrock seller of rare books – includes four typed letters. The letters, three of which have the John F Kennedy for President campaign letterhead, provide an insight into Kennedy’s campaign strategy as presidential contender. For example, two of the letters were sent to Charlotte Ward, who worked as a volunteer on Kennedy’s presidential campaign in 1960, thanking her for her support. “Kennedy’s personal tone reflects the campaign’s emphasis on grassroots, human-level engagement, a communications style that helped solidify the Kennedy image as charismatic, direct and youthful,” says Will de Búrca. Kennedy’s team relied heavily on enthusiastic local volunteers, especially the “Kennedy Girls”, a co-ordinated national programme designed to project glamour, energy and youth around the candidate. The archive also includes a black-and-white matte portrait of John F Kennedy, personally inscribed by him to Fionnula O’Sullivan. A complete set of six original 1964 photographs from United Press International, stamped with “For Personal Use Only/Not For Publication”, are also included. These press photographs documented Kennedy’s personal effects as they were being catalogued for transfer to the John F Kennedy Memorial Library. They include a photograph of the president’s desk, with the final day appointment calendar for Thursday, November 21st, with the last entry, Depart South Lawn for Texas. This was the trip during which he was assassinated on November 22nd, 1963. Another photograph shows JFK’s hi-fi set and his favourite Irish LPs. Another is of the handwritten doodles he was well known for making during meetings, while another is of his personal rocking chair, prescribed for his chronic back pain. “As a complement to the signed letters and inscribed photographs, these images deepen the emotional and narrative arc of the collection, moving from Kennedy during the 1960 campaign to his presidential persona to the physical remnants of his life gathered after his death,” says de Búrca. Collectors of Irish silver will have a couple of opportunities to seek out special pieces in the next week or so, with Hegarty Antiques selling the Part Two of a lifetime collection of Irish silver in their online auction on January 21st. Lisa Keane of Hegarty’s says that the Bandon auction house found 2025 to be a strong year for Irish silver – particularly provincial silver from Cork. “The majority of our buyers were from Ireland, but we did reach a worldwide market with buyers from Australia and the United States,” she says. Meanwhile, Irish silver expert Jimmy Weldon, of JW Weldon on Clarendon Street, Dublin, will be one of the stallholders at the first National Antique Fairs of 2026 at Limerick Racecourse on January 24th and 25th. Although a niche area for collectors, Irish silver with clear hallmarks made by historically significant Georgian silversmiths, still captures the attention of keen buyers. Silver made in Limerick, Waterford, Galway and Kinsale is also often of greater interest than Dublin-made silverware, because of its rarity. Weldon says prices are still very low for antique Irish silver. “It is very reasonable and underpriced,” says Weldon. His pièce de résistance at the Limerick fair will be an early 18th century Irish Queen Anne tankard for €17,500, made by David King. “King was one of the top three silver makers in Dublin and this is one of the best pieces of silver I ever bought,” says Weldon. “It would be a fine investment for someone.” Other pieces for sale will be an 18th-century silver tureen made by Dublin silver smith John Lloyd (€4,500), and an 18th-century Irish silver beer jug made by Dublin-based silversmith, Robert Calderwood (€17,500). Anyone clearing out period homes should consider bringing old hallmarked cutlery, coffee pots, candlesticks and silver trays to auctioneers for valuation, as you might be surprised by their value. For example, there is an Irish silver shell bowl soup ladle in Hegarty’s auction with an estimate of €350-€450, even though the maker’s mark is unclear. Weldon says he is always willing to value items – and even buy pieces – at antique fairs. “You never know what someone might bring along on the day,” he says. “But it must be silver. Anything that is silver-plated has little value.” hegartyantiques.com, deburcararebooks.com, weldons.ie Estimate €12,000 – €18,000 Hammer €15,000 Auction house Morgan O’Driscoll Estimate €50,000-€70,000 Hammer €44,000 Auction house Morgan O’Driscoll Estimate €1,500- €2,500 Hammer €4,200 Auction house Adam’s Estimate €500-€700 Hammer €1,900 Auction house Mullens Laurel Park © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

President Trump told Reuters on Wednesday that the "two Kevins," National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett and former Federal Reserve Governor Kevin Warsh, were his leading choices to replace Jerome Powell as Fed chairman. He may have narrowed it down to one Kevin. At a White House event Friday, Trump said he wants to keep Hassett, who regularly defends Trump's economic policies in TV appearances, in his current role, the Wall Street Journal reports. "I see Kevin's in the audience, and I just want to thank you. You were fantastic on television today. I actually want to keep you where you are, if you want ‌to know the truth," Trump said. Trump then turned to chief of staff Susie Wiles and said, "We don't want to lose him, Susie. We'll see how it all works out." Friday's remarks immediately boosted betting-market odds that Warsh will get the nod, the Journal reports. Interest-rate futures also shifted, with traders slightly dialing back expectations for a June rate cut, which would come at the first Fed meeting overseen by a new chair if one is seated right after Powell's term expires in May. Other names in circulation include Fed governor Christopher Waller and BlackRock executive Rick Rieder, with Trump saying this week he could decide within weeks. The search unfolds against the backdrop of a criminal probe into Powell, tied to whether he misled Congress about Fed building renovations. Two Republican senators say they will block any nominee until the widely criticized investigation is resolved, and Powell has called the probe part of wider efforts to pressure the Fed to cut rates. Trump has already vowed not to choose anyone who disagrees with him on lowering rates, raising concerns among lawmakers and on Wall Street that the next Fed chair could appear too closely aligned with the president. Some financial industry figures have argued Hassett is already perceived as too close to Trump to reassure bond markets, while allies of Warsh have been quietly lobbying for him. One Trump adviser tells the Journal that the favorite "sort of depends on the day." In the Reuters interview, Trump said he doesn't have any immediate plans to fire Powell because they're in a "little bit of a holding pattern with him." Asked about criticism of the investigation by senators who could block his choice for Powell's successor, he said: "I don't care. They should be loyal. That's what I say."

Title: Developers seek permission to replace Foxrock house with 10 new homes in €12m scheme

Developers are seeking permission for a €12.42 million scheme to transform a site in Foxrock that currently has a single home into a 10-house development, according to newly filed planning documents. Helnwin Ltd has applied to Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council for planning permission for the scheme that would see the seven-bed, six-bath Ashley on Hainault Road in Foxrock be demolished. It is proposed that the 430 sq m property would be replaced by 10 three-storey, detached houses. The housing will be comprised of two four-bed houses and eight three-bedroom homes. Each home would have two car parking spaces alongside electric vehicle charging points and visitors bicycle spaces. The 0.245 hectare site will have a density of 41 units per hectare, according to planning consultants John Spain Associates, with the homes being part-two, part-three storeys in height to “respond to the nature of the site and the surrounding residential dwellings”. The homes would be built in two rows leading away from the road, a site layout that the developer said was chosen to “avoid negative impacts” on neighbouring properties. The application referenced a precedent set by the approval of a similar planning application, which saw the lavish home of the late Liam Maye, Weaver’s Hall demolished and replaced by a block containing 50 apartments and a single bungalow. The house, called Ashley, sold for in the region of €2 million in February 2024, but the sale was delayed as the occupiers were seeking alternative housing following the deal. The property had been advertised as having “excellent potential” for further development in a “deservedly popular residential location”. Stephen Day of Lisney Sotheby’s International Realty in Blackrock said the property had been sold to a housing developer “with a very good track record of developing properties in South Dublin”. The sale price is included in a costing for the development attached to the planning application. The document details a total cost for the 10-home development of €12.42 million, including VAT, noting the per-unit cost of €1.24 million. Helnwin Ltd is a partnership between developer Myles Crofton and fellow property developer Bernard Doyle. Mr Crofton is the owner of the Renesca mansion on Cross Avenue, which he previously sought to demolish and replace with a series of homes. Mr Crofton built the Renesca home on the grounds of Chesterfield on Cross Avenue in Blackrock. He paid €47 million for the property in 2004, at the time making it the second most expensive Dublin home ever sold, second only to Walford, on Shrewsbury Road, which was sold for €58 million in 2005. Karin Crofton and Fionnuala Sherry are also listed as directors of the company in their filings to the Companies Registration Office (CRO). Ms Sherry is a former Eurovision winner, with the violinist winning the competition for Norway in 1995, and the wife of Mr Doyle. The developers had engaged in pre-application consultation with the council and amended the application in light of feedback from the local authority. Among the issues raised by the council was the lack of open space in the scheme. John Spain Associates noted in a report included in the application that “it is not feasible to provide good quality, accessible and usable public open space” in such a small site and suggested a contribution be paid to the council in lieu.

Title: Bitcoin sees $1.68B in weekly buys – Is BTC supply drying up?
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/?p=562149
Time Published: 2026-01-16T18:00:18Z
Full Content:
Bitcoin’s structure favors continuation as institutions tighten supply and momentum stabilizes. Institutional accumulation continues to tighten Bitcoin’s available supply. BlackRock clients recently purchased $319.7 million worth of BTC. At the same time, 635 BTC, valued at $60.53 million, moved from Coinbase to an unknown wallet. This transfer reduced exchange-side liquidity directly. Additionally, spot Bitcoin ETFs accumulated approximately 17,700 BTC, equivalent to $1.68 billion, within a single week. That level of demand absorbed a meaningful share of the circulating supply. However, the price did not react impulsively. Instead, Bitcoin consolidated above key levels. Therefore, large players appear focused on positioning rather than short-term distribution. Consequently, sell-side pressure continues to weaken structurally, supporting price stability during consolidation. At press time, Bitcoin [BTC] was trading above the accumulation range between roughly $84,600 and $94,000, a zone where buyers absorbed repeated sell-offs through December. Price rebounded sharply from the lower boundary near $84,600, confirming strong demand. Since then, Bitcoin reclaimed the $94,000 level, which now acts as immediate support. This reclaim matters because it marks a shift from absorption to expansion. Meanwhile, RSI climbed from sub-40 readings to around 63, reflecting a decisive momentum recovery without entering extreme territory. At the same time, Parabolic SAR flipped below the price near $91,800, signaling a trend shift in favor of buyers. With price pressing above $95,500 and eyeing resistance near $106,600, structure favors continuation rather than a return into consolidation. Source: TradingView At press time, the MVRV ratio stood at 1.6909, after slipping 1.23%. This reading confirms that holders remain comfortably in profit. However, it does not reflect extreme unrealized gains. Historically, heightened distribution risk emerges at much higher MVRV levels. Instead, the recent decline shows mild profit compression rather than aggressive selling. Long-term holders continue absorbing volatility. Therefore, supply pressure remains contained. Moreover, the absence of sharp MVRV spikes suggests greed has not taken control. This balance allows Bitcoin to consolidate while maintaining a constructive structure. Consequently, profitability supports stability rather than signaling exhaustion. Source: CryptoQuant At the time of writing, Funding Rates flipped decisively positive, surging by 1,047.79% to 0.002875. This rebound reflects renewed long-term confidence after prior deleveraging. However, funding remains moderate in absolute terms. Traders avoid excessive leverage. This restraint reduces liquidation risk during pullbacks. Moreover, funding adjusts quickly alongside price fluctuations. That behavior indicates disciplined positioning rather than speculative excess. At the same time, leverage rebuilds gradually, not aggressively. Therefore, derivatives activity supports continuation instead of fragility. This environment contrasts sharply with overheated rallies. It favors persistence and controlled upside. Source: CryptoQuant Binance top trader data showed 57.11% of accounts were holding long positions, while 42.89% remained short, producing a Long/Short Ratio of 1.33 at press time. This positioning reflects a clear bullish bias without crowding. Importantly, longs dominate without reaching extreme concentrations. Shorts remain active, limiting one-sided risk. However, their presence also reduces downside acceleration. Therefore, positioning stays balanced. Traders express confidence while maintaining caution. This alignment supports structural stability and lowers forced liquidation risk. Consequently, Bitcoin maintains flexibility as the price explores higher levels. Source: CoinGlass Conclusively, Bitcoin’s market structure signals strength built on control rather than speculation. Institutional accumulation continues to reduce available supply, while the price holds above key accumulation levels. Momentum indicators support upside without overheating, and leverage rebuilds in a disciplined manner. Meanwhile, top trader positioning remains constructive without crowding. If these dynamics remain intact, Bitcoin is more likely to extend its advance than revisit lower accumulation zones.

President Donald Trump on Friday said he wants to keep Kevin Hassett as his economic adviser, a remark that many interpreted as indicating he is less likely to be nominated to head the Federal Reserve. “I see Kevin is in the audience and I just want to thank you. You were fantastic on television today,” Trump said, referring to Hassett’s appearance on the Fox Business Network earlier on Friday. “I actually want to keep you where you are, if you want to know the truth.” Hassett is currently the National Economic Director, the top White House economics position. He has been considered one of the top contenders to be appointed to head the Fed when chairman Jerome Powell’s term expires this spring. The other leading contender is Kevin Warsh, a former Fed official, leading to people to speculate that Trump is likely to choose between what the president has called “the two Kevins.” The Trump administration has also interviewed Rick Rieder, the chief bond investment manager at Blackrock, and Trump-appoointed Fed governor Christopher Waller for the position. Both are considered dark horses because of their lack of a close relationship with the president. “Kevin Hassett is so good, I’m saying, ‘Wait a minute. These Fed guys, certainly the ones we have now, they don’t talk much. I would lose you. It’s a serious concern for me,” Trump said. “We don’t want to lose him Susie. So we’ll see how it all works out, okay?” Susie Wiles, Trump’s chief of staff, was also in the audience. Although Trump’s remarks elicited laughter in the room, they sent the odds of Warsh getting the nomination soaring on Polymarket. Hassetts odds fell sharply, putting him not far above Waller.

Former Federal Reserve Governor Kevin Warsh soared ahead of National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett on prediction markets betting on the next Fed chair after President Trump on Friday hinted that Hassett might be out of the running. Trump did not reveal his final choice to replace Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, but said he would like to keep Hassett in his current role. “I see Kevin’s in the audience, and I just want to thank you. You were fantastic on television today,” the president said during remarks at the White House on Friday. “I actually want to keep you where you are, if you want to know the truth.” The odds of Warsh clinching the nomination jumped to 60% on Polymarket as of Friday afternoon, while traders placed just a 17% chance that Hassett would land the job – following weeks in which markets placed better odds on Hassett. Current Fed Governor Christopher Waller, who has been considered a long shot, came in at 15%. Traders saw just a 6% chance that BlackRock exec Rick Rieder could win the role. Warsh also jumped to 59% odds on Kalshi, another prediction market. Hassett and Waller got 18% and 14% odds, respectively. Trump has not set a specific date to name his pick for the next chairman. Powell’s term at the helm expires in May, though he could choose to stay on the board through 2028. He has so far declined to comment on whether he will remain a Fed governor. On Sunday, Powell publicly shared that he’s under criminal investigation for allegedly lying during congressional testimony last summer — a stunning development that came after years of Trump blasting the chair for failing to lower interest rates quickly enough. For weeks, the president has signaled he is looking at either Warsh or Hassett to replace Powell, adding that he has ruled out Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent “because he wants to stay where he is.” Rieder and Waller have also been interviewed for the role.

While Trump said he’d like to keep Hassett in his current job, it’s not impossible for him to win the nomination. After Fed Governor Adriana Kugler unexpectedly resigned last summer, Trump tapped Stephen Miran, then a top White House economic adviser. Miran refused to fully resign from his White House role, instead taking an unpaid leave of absence. Addressing White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles on Friday, Trump said, “We don’t want to lose him [Hassett], Susie, but we’ll see how it all works out.”

© 2026 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy President Donald J. Trump’s war with the central bank of the United States, and Jerome Powell in particular, ratcheted up several DEFCONs this week. On Sunday night, Jan. 11, the Federal Reserve chairman released an extraordinary video, in which he recounted how Trump’s Department of Justice served him grand jury subpoenas and threatened a “criminal indictment” over his handling of a multibillion-dollar renovation to the Fed’s Eccles Building headquarters in Washington, D.C. Powell did not mince words or back down, and pointed the finger directly at Trump, implying the accusations surrounding the ongoing building renovations were a cover for the president’s frustrations that the Federal Reserve has not responded to Trump’s repeated desires that the benchmark Federal Funds Rate be lowered quicker from the 22-year high of the 5.25 to 5.5 percent target it reached in mid-2023. “The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the president,” said Powell. Today, the benchmark short-term interest rate stands between 3.5 percent and 3.75 percent after Powell lowered it three times in 2025 — yet clearly not low enough for Trump’s liking. And, while many voices within the world of finance have avoided wading into political flights, the action set off immediate alarm bells. “I think this is all about Trump not wanting to lose the midterms,” said Chad Carpenter, founder and CEO of Reven Capital. “What does he have to do to not lose the midterms? He needs to keep GDP up, keep employment and the stock market up, and bring costs down, and, right now, short-term interest rates are still relatively high.” But the perception that the independence of the Federal Reserve is being meddled with poses a much greater risk than an isolated political spat between a central banker and the executive branch. “An independent Fed is operating off a dual mandate set forward by Congress of price stability and full employment, and on this front, the executive branch is trying to come in and exert more influence over monetary policy,” explained Brian Bailey, who spent 14 years at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta and is now a senior researcher at commercial real estate loan servicer Trimont. “From that standpoint, you don’t want undue political interference creating additional factors that influence their decisions.” The negative reactions against Trump’s interference in Fed operations have been swift. Several top Republican senators and Trump allies have voiced their displeasure; numerous former Fed chairs and Treasury secretaries over the past 30 years signed a statement criticizing the move; and the right-leaning Wall Street Journal editorial board wrote, “In the annals of political lawfare there’s dumb, and then there’s the criminal subpoena federal prosecutors delivered to Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell.” However, across the commercial real estate spectrum, Trump does have his defenders. “Everyone knows what’s been going on: Trump has wanted an easing of monetary policy, and, frankly, that’s good for commercial real estate,” said Glen Kunofsky, founder and CEO of Surmount, an investment firm. “On the political and criminal indictment side, my view is that anything that puts pressure on the Fed to lower rates is a good thing.” Others in the industry criticized Powell’s record as Fed chair, which ironically began in 2018, when he was nominated by Trump during his first term, and continued through the 2020s after President Joe Biden kept him on to oversee the central bank coming out of the COVID pandemic. “Did Powell do such a good job? Eleven interest rate hikes in 12 months doesn’t sound rational to me,” said Adelaide Polsinelli, a vice chair at Compass. “Look at the repercussions of Federal Reserve policies: They’ve devastated the housing market and gutted real estate. How can you argue the actions of someone in his position were intelligent, or were consistent with historical analysis?” Under Powell’s watch, the Fed initiated the swiftest interest rate climb in 40 years, administered the painful medicine of quantitative tightening (whereby it reduced its $9 trillion balance sheet to less than $7 trillion, by selling short- and long-term U.S. bonds), and stood idly by as the 30-year rate on home mortgages shot up to its highest levels in two decades, mainly because of QT. Powell follows all his immediate predecessors who held the big chair in taking the blame for periodic nosedives in the economy: Janet Yellen kept interest rates too low for too long in the late 2010s; Ben Bernanke arguably responded too late to the housing bust in 2007-2008; and Alan Greenspan had the dot.com bubble explode on his watch in the early 2000s. “The Fed has a checkered history, but through it all the 10-Year [Treasury] figures out how to price itself,” said Alexander Goldfarb, senior research analyst at investment bank Piper Sandler, who noted the 10-Year Treasury has hung in the 4 percent range for much of the last year, as well as this week. “It goes up, it goes down a little, but credit spreads have been incredibly tight, debt is increasingly available across CRE capital markets,” he added. “So, yes, there’s drama at the Fed, and it provides great fodder for newspapers, but, ultimately, the market is speaking as far as access to capital.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average is actually up 0.63 percent since the Sunday night announcement of Trump’s investigation into Powell; the S&P 500 is up 0.67 percent — although this might be more due to the swift reaction from congressional Republicans in tamping down the feud before it got out of hand. Market strength aside, others in CRE argued against the move to hold a criminal indictment over Powell’s head. Carpenter defined it as “really wrong,” “baloney,” and “too strong a hand to play,” while Jon McAvoy, chief investment officer at PRP Real Assets, emphasized that Federal Reserve independence is “imperative to our nation.” “I really believe we have a mismatch in this country between short-term political appointees and elections with the need for the nation to have long-term financial stability,” he added. “And that’s what the Fed is supposed to help us with.” Historical precedent The complexities inherent in anything affecting leadership at the Federal Reserve are due to its intricate relationship between U.S. fiscal policy and monetary policy. The big fear, particularly among market watchers, is that by threatening Powell with criminal charges, Trump is setting a new precedent for how a president can act toward a Fed chair — in turn creating a situation where a nominally independent central bank can be browbeaten into action by the sitting president, particularly one presiding over nearly $40 trillion in public debt. “If there’s political pressure on the central bank without a change in the mandate, that’s problematic because it’s coming from the government having a fiscal need from the central bank,” said Juan Flores Zendejas, a professor of economics and history at the University of Geneva. “And that’s always bad news because this political pressure means you can damage the actual credibility, and even the capacity, of the central bank to succeed in doing what it’s supposed to do,” he added. Roughly $9 trillion in U.S. government debt — T-bills, T-notes, T-bonds, ranging from short-term to long-term — is scheduled to mature in 2026. But, as short-term interest rates remain higher than they were for much of the past 15 years, it becomes more expensive to refinance long-term maturing debt that was issued under the historically low interest rate regime that reigned from 2010 to 2022. For example, refinancing a portion of the national debt this year at a 2.6 percent interest rate, rather than a 3.6 percent, could potentially save the federal government hundreds of billions of dollars a year in interest payments going forward. “What [Treasury Secretary] Scott Bessent and Trump are trying to do is roll a majority of Treasury bills into short-term maturities, because they know they can control short-term, but not the long-term, interest rates,” explained Carpenter. “And the only way they can control the short-term rate is if the Fed lowers it — it’s a pure political move to apply pressure on Jerome Powell to lower rates.” The fear, of course, is that by cutting interest rates too quickly, the money supply could increase to a dangerous level, running the economy too hot and pushing consumer prices higher. “In a sense, you can artificially push rates down below the rate that the economy functions best at, and, from that standpoint, you could create inflationary pressures down the road,” said Bailey. To some economists, this play is straight out of the ancient history books, and one being initiated by Trump and Bessent by design to lower the threat of the $38 trillion national debt. “Every student of monetary policy history knows that governments want to monetize debt, and the politically easy thing to do is to inflate your way out of a debt problem,” said Christopher Thornberg, founding partner at Beacon Economics. “This has been done going back to Rome and the great inflation of the 3rd century CE. There’s nothing here that we haven’t seen before.” And then there’s the separate argument of the precedent concerning Fed independence altogether. Political pressure has been deployed in the past, and has largely been effective (although certainly not threats of imprisonment). Richard Nixon infamously pressured his friend and former White House economic adviser, Arthur Burns, after appointing him Fed chairman, even joking at Burns’s January 1970 swearing-in ceremony, “I respect his independence, however I hope that — independently — he will conclude that my views are the ones that should be followed.” Burns’s diaries, as well as the infamous recorded tapes of White House meetings, revealed that Nixon repeatedly implored Burns to “keep the money supply up!” and prioritize the president’s re-election goals over the broader economy. Lyndon B. Johnson also coerced Fed Chair William McChesney Martin in the 1960s, going so far as to shove him into a wall at his Texas Ranch. Long before there was a Federal Reserve, in the 1830s President Andrew Jackson waged (and won) an honest-to-god legal and political battle against Nicholas Biddle, president of the Second Bank of the United States, the 19th-century forerunner to the Fed, over allegations of favoritism toward wealth merchants and speculators. “We can start with there was precedence for this — Nixon, Johnson, Reagan, they all challenged and pressured their Fed chairs,” said Polsinelli. “This is not a new thing.” Others questioned the perceived need for the Fed to be an independent body to begin with. “I don’t think the Fed should be independent. I think the Fed should be hand-in-hand with the president,” said Greg Kraut, co-founder and CEO of KPG Funds. “I’ve never agreed the Fed should be an independent body. The whole idea of the Fed being independent is complete nonsense.” Polsinelli added that even if Powell and the Fed are seen as independent, it shouldn’t protect them from the consequences of poor policies. “It doesn’t mean that independence should shield Powell from review over mistakes or choices he’s made that have done harm to the economy,” she said. “Without questioning him, you have the opposite effect.” But Zendejas countered that any idea that the Fed is not democratically accountable to its dual mandate of price stability and full employment — one legally passed by Congress in 1977 — is both misconstrued and misguided. “This argument can be contested to the extent that this dual mandate is given by a government which is democratically elected, so in that regard it doesn’t mean the mandate can’t change,” he said. “But governments have given these mandates.” And no less an eminence than Jamie Dimon, chairman of J.P. Morgan Chase, said earlier this week that, “Everyone believes in Fed independence. … Anything that chips away at that is probably not a great idea, and in my view will have reverse consequences.” Uncertain times These reverse consequences that Dimon hints at have been carefully noted by financial analysts and seen in the failure of other countries. Francesco Pesole, a foreign exchange strategist at ING, the Dutch multinational banking firm, wrote a memo following news of the Powell investigation, calling the development “explosive,” and adding that any perceptions of the loss of Federal Reserve independence would fuel a “major depreciation” of the U.S. dollar. “The downside risks for the dollar from any indications of further determination to interfere with the Fed’s independence are substantial,” Pesole wrote. “A sharp steepening of the [bond] curve could take the dollar on a fall.” Aside from its impact on the dollar, higher long-term bond yields are one of the main symptoms of inflation, the horrible phenomenon of increased prices on just about everything, and these yields are unfortunately tied not just to investor sentiment toward the safety of U.S. Treasurys, but also to the fiscal responsibility of U.S. politicians to manage the nation’s annual budget deficits. Since 2020, the U.S. government, under both Trump and Biden, has averaged an increase in the budget deficit of $2.5 trillion per year. Just 17 years ago, in 2009, the entire federal debt was only $12.3 trillion. “We’re right on the edge of diving into a fiscal crisis,” said Thornberg. “It can get very ugly very quickly, and it will have massive ramifications for the global economy and for financial markets.” Even the idea of lower short-term interest rates has been criticized by some market players, especially after the emergency cuts initiated by Powell in 2020 and 2021 set the stage for price increases across the economy. Reven Capital’s Carpenter noted that “the lower the interest rate, the higher the inflation, and the perfect example of that was in 2021.” That year, interest rates were below 1 percent, and asset values shot through the roof as investors poured into hard assets like CRE to find yield that wasn’t there in fixed-income bonds, all while the economy ran hot against a dimly perceived supply-chain bottleneck. “Dropping rates inflates asset values and allows people to refinance at higher valuations (i.e. cap rates), so they’re borrowing more than normal, and it puts companies at financial leverage risk,” he said. “But, long term, you don’t want the rates super low -— you want fixed-income to make money on government debt, and you want realistic cap rates on commercial real estate.” Others in the market aren’t quite as concerned about the long-term threat of another bout of inflation stemming from artificially lower rates. “I think inflation is complete hogwash, and I think the idea of 2 percent inflation is B.S. — the standard rate should be 3 percent,” said Kraut, who said COVID and supply chains caused price spikes. “I don’t see any indication that if you lower interest rates it will lead to inflation. Lower interest rates will spur economic growth.” Kraut added that if the Federal Reserve doesn’t cut interest rates by at least 150 basis points this year, then he believes the U.S. will fall into “a major recession, almost a depression.” Even so, PRP’s McAvoy emphasized that “political manipulation of the Fed is a real concern,” and that while a risk premium for volatility is already priced into the bond market, “the question is whether this next moment [with Powell] will cause a need for that premium to have a future increase.” The more important point is the reason Fed watchers like McAvoy, Thornberg, Carpenter and even Dimon are so concerned about political manipulation of the Fed, and its impact on the strength of the dollar and bond market, is due to what has happened in other countries. In July, Rebecca Patterson, an economist who has held senior positions at J.P. Morgan Chase and Bridgewater Associates, wrote a New York Times op-ed once the first real rumblings of Trump encroaching on Powell’s independence could be heard. Patterson listed how Victor Orban in Hungary stacked the deck against his country’s central bank by adding handpicked council members to the monetary policy committee and passing laws in 2011 to strengthen his direct control over the bank. Since then, credit ratings agencies have downgraded the country’s debt to junk status, in turn raising borrowing costs across Hungary and causing its currency to weaken against the Euro. She also documented how Turkey President Recep Tayyip Erdogan issued a decree in 2018 to assume total control across the country’s central bank, and has since hired and fired numerous monetary policymakers. The results speak for themselves: The Turkish lira has lost 88 percent of its value against the dollar since 2018, and inflation in Turkey rose from 15 percent to 88 percent within seven years, while the country’s 10-year government bond yields reached as high as 30 percent. Zendejas said the most pertinent parallel to Trump’s actions with Powell come out of Argentina, where then-President Cristina Fernandez fired Martín Redrado, president of the Central Bank, in January 2010 after he rejected her public demands that he resign for refusing to use the country’s foreign currency reserves to pay down the national debt. Zendejas said the messy fight between this chief executive and her central banker immediately led to a depreciation of the peso and an increase in inflation, which was already relatively high in Argentina. “It was a mess, and had a long-term effect on both the credibility of the central bank and its capacity to manage inflation and interest rates, and the capacity for Argentina to avert capital flight and stabilize its economy,” he said. Next steps Even without opening a criminal investigation, Trump won’t have to wait long to have a new leader at the Fed: Powell’s term expires in May, and the president will get to select a successor one way or another. For now, Senate Republicans like Thom Tillis and Lisa Murkowski have expressed their willingness to block Trump’s next Federal Reserve nominee until his actions against Powell are resolved, but at some point this year the Senate will need to take up a nominee brought forward by a president who demands lower interest rates and isn’t afraid to trample over institutional norms. “Are there bulwarks? If you asked the question 15 months ago, a lot of people would’ve been quick to answer a certain way,” said McAvoy. “Right now, enough folks are questioning the norms, and the strength of the norms, that no one would want to answer that affirmatively at this moment.” The list of potential successors to Powell is relatively short, and include former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, current Fed Governor Christopher Waller, BlackRock executive Rick Rieder and current Fed Governor Stephen Miran. But the name that stands out among them is current White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett, a man widely believed to be a Trump loyalist who has been close to the president since his first term in office. Just hours after Powell released his video to push back at Trump, Hassett made a television appearance in which he stated he “would expect that the markets would be happy to see that there’s more transparency at the Fed.” “This guy? Come on, this is Mr. Dow 36,000,” scoffed Thornberg, referring to the title of Hassett’s 1999 book that predicted a Dow Jones Industrial Average of 36,000 by 2002 or 2004 — which didn’t happen for more than 20 years after publication. “I think most economists view this guy with something between contempt and disrespect. You put him in, and see what the markets think of him. But I’ve been amazed at how benign the markets have been to all this chaos.” McAvoy also pegged Hassett as the favorite, pointing to his longtime allegiance to Trump. “Some would argue there’s a benefit to him because he seems to have been able to get Trump’s ear in understanding larger economic issues,” said McAvoy. “I don’t know whether or not he will be independent, but I’m sure during the confirmation process that will be the central issue.” Regardless of who succeeds Powell, and what comes next for the U.S. economy, there’s no doubt that by opening a criminal investigation into the existing Federal Reserve chairman, Trump has forever changed the relationship that body has had with the White House. “Trump’s challenging the narrative and calling out the inconsistencies, and that’s something people should want,” said Polsinelli. “The Fed chairman is not supposed to be in an ivory tower making decisions that affect you and me and our families without challenge.” But as Thornberg noted, Trump made his fortune in the 1980s by playing fast and loose with easy money policies and the junk bond market — and he eventually catapulted into personal bankruptcy that left his many creditors holding the bag for his own fiscal mismanagement. “Trump is the original ‘pump and dump’ guy, and has been since the dawn of time,” said Thornberg. “He has no interest in the long run, or even a decade from now. All he wants is wins right now, and he’s willing to sacrifice the future to get those instantaneous wins. “I think this is a terrible precedent,” he added.

Title: Trump Officials Vow to Keep All US Coal Plants Running

Trump administration officials vowed to keep US coal power plants operating, casting it as an imperative to meet surging electricity demand and drive a revival of the nation’s industrial base. “The goal is 100% open,” said Interior Secretary Doug Burgum. “That’s the standard we’re operating against.” Burgum’s comment came during the first meeting of Trump’s newly reconstituted National Coal Council, an advisory panel that Joe Biden let lapse during his presidency. President Donald Trump, by contrast, has sought to engineer a coal resurgence in his second term, including byrequiring some power plants to keep burning the fuel. The bullish Trump administration predictions for America’s coal — and the power plants that rely on it — contrast with a more skeptical view from analysts who point to generation from natural gas and renewables. The message comes as the Trump administration addresses concerns about rising electricity prices and consumer costs, an issue that weighs heavily on Republicans’ bid to keep control of the House and Senate in November’s elections. Focusing on the existing coal fleet works better as a short-term strategy, according to Andy Blumenfeld, director of data analytics at McCloskey by Opis. While they’re generating power now, many of the plants are old and will require significant maintenance if the administration expects them to remain in service for a while. And in the meantime, utilities will be able to turn to gas and nuclear capacity that will likely become more widely available over the next several years. “We need the power, and the coal units are there now,” said Blumenfeld. “But in the long term, they’re up against an aging coal fleet.” In a move aimed at addressing some of these issues, the Energy Department is putting aside as much as $525 million to upgrade or build coal-fired power plants, a move criticized by environmental groups. Trump has moved quickly to dial back regulations and subsidies that have encouraged emissions-free renewable power. Under Trump, the Energy Department also has issued emergency orders requiring some coal plants to keep running, and the Environmental Protection Agency recently rejected a bid by Colorado to force the closing of one of its coal plants in the central part of the state. Meanwhile, the Interior Department has also moved to open more federal land for coal leasing in North Dakota, Montana and Wyoming. “Seventeen gigawatts of coal generation are open today that would not have been open,” said Energy Secretary Chris Wright, attributing some of that shift to the short-termemergency ordersforcing plants to operate. “You will not see those coal plants close during this administration.” Wright said utilities are now calling the Energy Department in a bid to keep plants running, despite some states pushing to shutter the facilities. Burgum, who leads Trump’s National Energy Dominance Council, went even further, predicting new coal plant construction — though many analysts have foreclosed the possibility. The National Coal Council meeting on Thursday included discussion of options for maintaining and growing the nation’s fleet of coal plants, as well as opportunities to expand exports of the fossil fuel. The roughly 60-member panel includes executives from some of the nation’s top coal producers, such as Peabody Energy, Warrior Met Coal Inc., Hallador Energy Co. and Nacco Industries Inc.,as well as power utilities and co-operatives such as FirstEnergy Corp. and Norfolk Southern Corp. Joe Craft, chief executive officer of Alliance Resource Partners, a Trump donor, is a member; Jim Grech, CEO of Peabody Energy is chairing the group; and Jimmy Brock, CEO of Core Natural Resources Inc., is vice-chair. US coal consumption has declined for years as utilities increasingly shift toward cheaper natural gas and renewables. Coal once accounted for more than half of the country’s electricity generation, but that share fell to about 17% in 2025 and is expected to slip to 15% this year. A boom in US electricity demand, however, has provided a near-term tailwind for coal producers. Utilities have delayed retirement of coal-fired power plants, while federal orders keep others running, supporting demand and contributing to a modest rebound in 2025. Electric generation from coal climbed 13% last year, driven largely by higher gas prices. The downward trajectory is expected to resume in 2026, according to government forecasts. During Thursday’s meeting, coal and utility executives warned about overdependence on natural gas as a US power source. Some urged doing more to protect America’s mines, others emphasized the need to keep rising electricity prices in check. Wright linked coal power to a thriving manufacturing sector, and Burgum said it’s intertwined with US efforts to win the artificial intelligence competition with China — both Trump administration goals. The immediate focus now is ensuring there’s enough electricity, especially for the data centers that are key to developing AI capabilities, said Randall Atkins, CEO of coal supplier Ramaco Resources Inc. and a member of the council who attended the meeting Thursday. “The objective is the data centers, and how we’re going to figure out how to power them,” Atkins said in an interview. Separately, Wright warned that if courts compel some of the world’s largest asset managers to divest coal-related assets, it could undermine efforts to buttress coal mining and electricity generation. That’s the potential outcome of a lawsuit alleging that BlackRock Inc., Vanguard Group Inc. and the asset management arm of State Street Corp. colluded to reduce coal output. Republican state attorneys general, led by Texas’ Ken Paxton, say the firms violated antitrust laws by using environmental, social and governance-related initiatives, including carbon-reduction alliances, to suppress production. Read More: BlackRock, State Street, Vanguard Must Face Antitrust Suit Fossil fuel advocates have criticized ESG initiatives as forcing capital away from oil, gas and coal. But former Trump Energy Secretary and Texas Governor Rick Perry has predicted that if successful, the lawsuit would take an estimated $18 billion in coal holdings off the asset managers’ books. He said that outcome would pose “a direct threat to coal companies’ ability to raise capital, finance infrastructure and support jobs.” Photo: The PacifiCorp Hunter coal-fired electrical generation plant in Castle Dale, Utah.

Title: WEF: Donald Trump set to dominate Davos 2026
URL: https://www.dw.com/en/wef-donald-trump-set-to-dominate-davos-2026/a-75509182

Weeks after attacking Venezuela, capturing its controversial leader, and reviving Greenland ambitions, the US president's presence in Davos is expected to raise the stakes at the WEF's annual meeting. The Swiss Alpine town of Davos is once again welcoming the cream of the political, economic and cultural world for the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum (WEF). The event is taking place at a time US President Donald Trump is seeking to dismantle the international order: From upending established trade rules and mass withdrawal from international organizations, including the UN climate treaty, to capturing Venezuela's Nicolas Maduro following an attack on the capital Caracas and threatening to annex Greenland from close ally Denmark. Just days before the start of the WEF meeting, Trump threatened to impose tariffs on eight NATO allies, including Germany, France and the UK, if they don't support his quest to take control of the Arctic island, eliciting a forceful rebuke from the European allies. Trump's assault on the international rules that have largely been in place since World War II, and its impact on the global peace, politics and the economy is expected to be among the key topics during the five-day event beginning January 19 under the theme A Spirit of Dialogue. "Dialogue is not a luxury in times of uncertainty; it is an urgent necessity," said Borge Brende, WEF President and CEO. "At a critical juncture for international cooperation — marked by profound geoeconomic and technological transformation — this year's annual meeting will be one of our most consequential." Donald Trump will be joined by more than 60 heads of state and government, including German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, Argentinian President Javier Milei, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, China's Vice Premier He Lifeng, Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Syrian leader Ahmad al-Sharaa. Trump is leading the largest US delegation ever to Davos, comprising five cabinet secretaries and other senior officials. The delegation includes Secretary of State Marco Rubio, special envoy Steve ​Witkoff and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, setting the stage for high-profile discussions on Ukraine, Venezuela, Gaza and Iran, where eyewitnesses have reported a brutal crackdown on anti-government protests. Trump is expected to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Kyiv's G7 allies — including leaders from Germany, Italy, France, the UK, Canada and the European Commission president — on the sidelines of the main event to seek US backing for security guarantees for Ukraine after a possible peace agreement with Russia. European leaders and officials are expected to use their meetings with the US president and his team to discuss Greenland and urge him to retract his tariff threat. The strong US presence would be complemented by the first-ever "USA House" — a venue housed in a small church on the town's main Promenade street, where US officials will host events and network with investors. While geopolitical upheavals and the ensuing uncertainty are expected to dominate discussions, policymakers and business leaders would be keen to discuss ways to deal with other challenges confronting the global economy. The global economy has been relatively resilient despite heightened trade tensions and policy uncertainty, thanks in part to massive investments related to artificial intelligence (AI) in the US, which have propped up the world's biggest economy. But the projected global growth of 3.1% in 2026 is still not ideal, especially at a time when global debt has climbed to levels not seen since World War II. The debt situation in several African countries is especially concerning, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Global trade remains under pressure as countries adopt increasingly protectionist policies, such as imposing unilateral tariffs, increasing restrictions on foreign investment and tightening supply on critical minerals. Economic confrontation between nations and its consequences topped the WEF's annual Global Risks Report released on Wednesday. Artificial intelligence is another focus this year, with several events and talks dedicated to the frontier technology, much like at recent WEF annual meetings. Top tech leaders such as Microsoft's Satya Nadella, Nvidia's Jensen Huang and Google's AI chief Demis Hassabis will be at the event. AI is already showing a lot of promise in fields such as medicine and education and has seen trillions of dollars worth of investments made or promised over the past few years, even though many companies are currently struggling to find real-world use cases for the technology that offer good value. There are concerns about the technology's impact on jobs, many of which are feared to become redundant in the next few years. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, among this year's attendees, says that AI could eliminate half of all entry-level white-collar jobs in the next one to five years, underscoring a need for massive investment in reskilling. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video AI risks worsening the existing digital divide, with poorer countries failing to capitalize on the opportunities. There are also concerns about AI models perpetuating existing biases, spreading misinformation, and generating deepfakes. Misinformation and disinformation and cybersecurity are among the top global risks, according to the WEF risks survey, underscoring the need for effective regulations. This year's meeting would be the first without WEF founder Klaus Schwab at the helm. The German-born economist resigned in April 2025, amid allegations that he and his wife used WEF funds for personal use. An independent inquiry, however, found no criminal misconduct, only minor irregularities. Schwab has been succeeded by interim co-chairs Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, and Andre Hoffmann, vice chair of Swiss pharmaceuticals company Roche Holdings. This year's strong line-up of attendees comes as a boost for the organization after a tumultuous year. The organization that's been around since 1971 to foster dialogue now faces headwinds as multilateralism wanes and free trade comes under fire. Edited by: Uwe Hessler Editor's note: The piece, originally published on January 16, has been updated to reflect Donald Trump's tariff threats against eight countries for not supporting his plans to annex Greenland.

Title: Germans should work more – Merz

Germans should put in more work to revive the country’s moribund economy, Chancellor Friedrich Merz has stated. Merz, who once chaired the supervisory board of BlackRock in Germany, has also acknowledged the country’s “strategic mistake” of abandoning nuclear power and cutting itself off from cheap Russian oil and gas, which have forced up energy prices and sent the economy into a two-year recession. In a speech on Wednesday, the chancellor lamented that “labor costs in our country are simply too high,” while the “productivity of our economy is not high enough.” He urged Germans to commit to “greater economic output… through more work.” “With work-life balance and a four-day week, the prosperity our country enjoys today cannot be maintained in the future - and that’s why we have to work more,” Merz insisted. Last August, the chancellor stated that the “welfare state as we have it today can no longer be financed with what we can economically afford.” He noted that welfare spending hit a record €47 billion ($55 billion) in 2024, and continued to rise. That same month, Merz acknowledged that the German economy had slid into a “structural crisis,” with large sectors “no longer truly competitive.” In spite of these adverse economic trends, Merz prioritized the militarization of the country, citing a perceived Russia threat. Moscow has repeatedly dismissed claims that it harbors aggressive intentions toward its Western neighbors as “nonsense.” In May, the chancellor pledged to transform the German military into the “strongest conventional army in Europe.”To this end, the German government has changed its budget rules to permit long-term defense spending beyond the €100-billion fund. Last October, Politico, citing internal government documents, claimed that Berlin was planning to shell out some €377 billion ($440 billion) for a comprehensive rearmament program, which is expected to stretch beyond the 2026 budget.

Title: BlackRock vs. Blackstone: What every would-be homebuyer needs to know

BlackRock, Blackstone – what’s the difference? It’s a question that a lot of folks – journalists included – don’t seem to be crystal clear about after President Trump made a bombshell pledge last week to crack down on big private equity firms who have bought up huge chunks of the US residential real estate market. That’s why BlackRock – the world’s biggest money manager run by Larry Fink with some $14 trillion in assets — has built a “rapid response” crisis team to, among other things, distinguish itself from Blackstone, the world’s largest private equity firm run by Steve Schwarzman, On The Money has learned. The big message: BlackRock is not the firm that’s hoovering up all the houses and allegedly creating a nationwide affordability crisis. You’re probably thinking of that other firm. On Wall Street, mind you, there’s zero confusion about who is who. BlackRock, whose voluble CEO Fink is a fixture on financial TV, is the asset-managing giant that seems to own a massive slug of just about every public company you can think of. But it’s Blackstone CEO Steve Schwarzman – who was often photographed alongside the president during Trump’s first administration – who is now in the crosshairs of the White House over his habit of scooping up single-family homes. The problem, BlackRock officials tell On The Money, is that they’ve been getting inundated with social media accusing the money manager of profiting on the backs of average Americans. And it’s not just a bunch of dudes in their mom’s basement slinging mud at the firm. Celebrities and influencers – right-wingers among them – have joined the confused BlackRock bashing, spurred by Trump’s recent calls to address the affordability crisis by ending the buying of single family homes, they tell On The Money. “You wouldn’t believe how much of our day is consumed by this bullshit,” said one executive at the big money manager. The official cited, for example, an X post from September by comedian Rob Schneider which stated “The administration must stop the single home buying hoarding monopoly and GIVE A TARIFF or TAX on the companies that are SPECULATING and turning YOUNG PEOPLE into FOREVER RENTERS; BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street.” To set things straight, BlackRock’s new crisis team has set up a social media account @BlackrockFact. Following the news from Trump, the team swung into action posting that “Other US Investment firms are buying single-family real estate – BlackRock is not one of them. We do not buy individual houses.” Yes, the trolling reached new heights last week after the president posted on his social media site, Truth Social, that he is “immediately taking steps to ban large institutional investors from buying more single-family homes, and I will be calling on Congress to codify it. People live in homes, not corporations.” Those steps have yet to materialize and, people at Blackstone tell me, they won’t make a dent in the home affordability problem — even if Trump gets congressional buy-in to do it. That’s because the buying, I am told, is taking place in markets like the Sunbelt where lack of housing stock isn’t a huge issue.

Never miss a story. Truth be told, there are good reasons why the two companies get confused. In fact, their names are similar because they were once the same company. Fink, after leaving his job as a trader at a big Wall Street bank, started BlackRock as an asset-management subsidiary of Schwarzman’s PE firm back in the late 1980s. A few years later in 1994, while BlackRock was growing, Fink decided to buy himself out. The rest is history. Schwarzman has often lamented this given the size of the business Fink ultimately created. The two have maintained a somewhat interesting rivalry, although Schwarzman clearly isn’t hurting, with a net worth of $48 billion, according to Forbes. Still, it might be time to understand the difference between a rock and a stone. Advertisement

Title: The Venezuela Technocracy Connection
URL: https://www.activistpost.com/the-venezuela-technocracy-connection/
Time Published: 2026-01-16T11:00:00Z
Full Content:
In the early morning hours of January 3, 2026, the United States military launched military strikes on Venezuela and captured President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores. Maduro and Flores have since been transported to the New York City to face charges relating to gun crimes and cocaine trafficking. The move has divided the MAGA base—and the American public more generally—with a large portion of President Donald Trump’s base viewing it as a betrayal of the principles he claimed to champion. Specifically, Trump has claimed for years he would not start new wars of aggression. While Trump has stated that taking out Maduro is not about launching new wars but instead a calculated attack to take out a man he blames for America’s fentanyl crisis, the facts tell another story. In May 2025, the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) released its 2025 National Drug Threat Assessment (NDTA). This report mentions Venezuela trafficking fentanyl to the US a total of zero times. Instead, it blames Mexican cartels for the manufacturing and trafficking of fentanyl. This should come as no surprise to anyone paying attention, as these facts are common knowledge among the US government and drug-trafficking researchers. A second key point is that although Trump and neocon Secretary of State Marco Rubio have repeatedly sought to tie Maduro to drug cartels, there remains scant evidence for the claim. The US government previously claimed Maduro was the head of the drug-trafficking group Cartel de los Soles (also known as the Cartel of the Suns). However, many skeptics have claimed the group doesn’t actually exist. During Trump’s first term, Maduro was indicted as the alleged leader of this cartel. In 2025, during his second term, Cartel de los Soles was officially designated a foreign terrorist organization. However, when Maduro was brought to NYC and officially charged, the US Department of Justice dropped the allegations from their indictment. The lack of charges relating to Cartel de los Soles is a signal that the US government does not believe it has strong enough evidence to convict Maduro in court. Instead, they have changed their tune and are now claiming Maduro was involved in cocaine trafficking. Hours after the raid and capture of Maduro, Trump held a press conference in which he made it perfectly clear that, despite official claims of targeting drug traffickers, the US government’s interest lies in gaining control over Venezuela’s oil industry. Make No Mistake – Venezuela is About Oil and Empire During a Saturday morning press conference, US President Donald Trump made it perfectly clear that despite claims of going after drug traffickers, the US government is interested in taking over the Venezuelan oil industry. pic.twitter.com/AJiyrh83j9 “We’re going to have our very large United States oil companies, the biggest anywhere in the world, go in, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure, the oil infrastructure, and start making money for the country,” Trump stated. In 2007, Venezuela nationalized oil projects, seizing assets from companies such as ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips after they refused to accept terms that would give the state-owned Petróleos de Venezuela, S.A. (PDVSA) majority control. In contrast, companies like Total, Chevron, Statoil (now Equinor), and BP agreed to the restructuring and retained minority stakes in their Venezuelan projects. Trump has claimed that these actions were a theft of American oil and that part of the US presence in Venezuela will be to take this oil. “In addition, Venezuela unilaterally seized and sold American oil, American assets, and American platforms costing us billions and billions of dollars. This constituted one of the largest thefts of American property in the history of our country. Considered the largest theft of property in the history of our country,” Trump said at the Saturday morning press conference. When pressed by journalists about his comments regarding the US “running” Venezuela, Trump responded by claiming that the oil companies would cover the costs of improvements to Venezuelan oil infrastructure. “Well, we’re gonna be running it with a group and we’re gonna make sure it’s run properly. We’re gonna rebuild the oil infrastructure, which will cost billions of dollars. It’ll be paid for by the oil companies directly.” However, Trump also appeared to suggest that US taxpayers would subsidize oil companies to rebuild the infrastructure. “They will be reimbursed for what they’re doing, but, that’s gonna be paid. And we’re gonna get the oil flowing the way it should be,” Trump claimed. In an interview with NBC News on Monday, Trump made a similar statement. “I think we can do it in less time than that, but it’ll be a lot of money,” he said. “A tremendous amount of money will have to be spent and the oil companies will spend it, and then they’ll get reimbursed by us or through revenue.” With Trump admitting that a major motivation for taking out Maduro was to benefit oil companies, it’s important to ask which companies are involved and who holds shares in them. Chevron, ExxonMobil, and ConocoPhillips were involved in Venezuela’s oil sector before the nationalization under Hugo Chávez and during the subsequent US sanctions era. BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street are the majority institutional shareholders of all three companies, typically controlling around 20-25% of the shares in each (with Vanguard and BlackRock often holding the largest stakes among institutions). Larry Fink is the co-founder, chairman, and CEO of BlackRock. He’s also the current Interim Co-Chair of the World Economic Forum. Fink also maintains a close relationship with Donald Trump, having known him for over 40 years due to both men having been involved in the Manhattan financial scene. In fact, in March 2025 it was announced that Larry Fink had consulted with Trump before he secured the purchase of two ports in the Panama Canal for BlackRock. Given Trump’s close relationship with Larry Fink, combined with BlackRock’s significant investments in major U.S. oil companies such as Chevron, ExxonMobil, and ConocoPhillips, these are more than likely influencing factors in the U.S. policy toward Venezuela’s oil sector. Fink is not the only billionaire benefiting handsomely from the capture of Maduro and the US occupation of the Venezuelan oil industry. Among the billionaires celebrating the US aggression is Paul Singer, a billionaire hedge fund manager whose firm, Elliot Investment Management, has long sought to acquire CITGO Petroleum, the US-based subsidiary of Venezuela’s state-owned oil company PDVSA. In November 2025, a U.S. judge approved a $5.9 billion bid by an Elliott affiliate (Amber Energy) to purchase shares in CITGO’s parent company (PDV Holding) through a court-organized auction aimed at satisfying creditors’ claims against Venezuela. The sale still requires final approval from the U.S. Treasury Department and other regulators. CITGO’s assets include three major oil refineries (in Louisiana, Texas, and Illinois), pipelines, terminals, and more than 4,000 CITGO-branded gas stations across the United States. With Trump relaxing sanctions on Venezuelan oil following the removal of Maduro, Singer stands to benefit to the tune of billions if the CITGO sale is eventually approved. Coincidentally, Singer was a major donor to Trump’s presidential campaigns, as well as to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC). US Representative Thomas Massie has also claimed that Singer has already spent more than $1 million in an attempt to defeat him in his upcoming reelection bid. According to Grok, Paul Singer, globalist Republican mega-donor who’s already spent $1,000,000 to defeat me in the next election, stands to make billions of dollars on his distressed CITGO investment, now that this administration has taken over Venezuela.https://t.co/hq1STlEyAq It’s quite obvious that oil is one of the major drivers behind the US kidnapping of Maduro, but drugs and oil alone do not fully explain why Trump is desperate to have control over this region. In the early 20th century, a movement emerged around a political theory known as Technocracy—a system in which government and society would be managed by technical experts, often involving technology-focused solutions. Early proponents claimed that Technocracy would lead to better management of resources and the protection of the planet. However, this system of governance by technological experts and their technology would also involve a loss of privacy, as well as centralization of power and the management of all human behavior. One of the most influential proponents of Technocracy was a man named Howard Scott, a writer and engineer who founded the Technical Alliance in New York City in 1919. Scott believed that business owners lacked the necessary skills and data to reform their industries, and thus control should be handed over to engineers and scientists. In 1932, Scott and fellow technocrat Walter Rautenstrauch established the “Committee on Technocracy” at Columbia University. The group would eventually splinter, with Scott leading Technocracy Incorporated, while technocrat Harold Loeb headed the rival Continental Committee on Technocracy. In 1938, Technocracy Incorporated released a publication that outlined its vision for a Technocracy and their plan for merging North America and parts of central America into a single continental unit which they called a “Technate”: Technocracy is the science of social engineering, the scientific operation of the entire social mechanism to produce and distribute goods and services to the entire population of this continent. For the first time in human history it will be done as a scientific, technical, engineering problem. There will be no place for Politics or Politicians, Finance or Financiers, Rackets or Racketeers. Technocracy states that price and abundance are incompatible; the greater the abundance the smaller the price. In a real abundance there can be no price at all. Only by abandoning the interfering price control and substituting a scientific method of production and distribution can an abundance be achieved. Technocracy will distribute by means of a certificate of distribution available to every citizen from birth to death. The Technate will encompass the entire American Continent from Panama to the North Pole because the natural resources and the natural boundary of this area make it an independent, self- sustaining geographical unit. [emphasis added] A 1940 map from Technocracy Inc. clearly shows this vision included Canada, the United States, Mexico, the Caribbean, and Central American countries—including Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, and Guatemala, and others. The fact that Panama was envisioned as part of the Technate should not be forgotten in light of Larry Fink’s efforts to purchase ports in the Panama Canal. The Technocrats also imagined controlling parts of Venezuela and even Colombia. The 1940 map shows portions of northern Venezuela and eastern Colombia absorbed by the Technate. Colombia’s place in the proposed Technate adds important context to Trump’s recent threats of military action in the nation. The Technocrats were not only focused on incorporating Central and South American nations into the Technate. They aimed to spread their techno-tyranny as far north as Greenland. In a July 1940 issue of Technocracy magazine, Howard Scott and Technocracy Inc. explicitly advocated for acquisition of Greenland: “The government of the United States should take immediate action to acquire these territories and others, such as Greenland and the Galapagos Islands. The acquisition of these territories should be a mandatory part of the program of Continental defense for immediate achievement—either by purchase, negotiation, or the force of arms. The original Technocrats’ plans for taking control over Greenland has repeatedly been echoed by Trump since taking office in 2025. Following the kidnapping of Maduro, Trump and allies have renewed their calls for taking the island. On Monday, Trump’s top adviser and deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller claimed that Greenland belonged to the United States and that the US military could seize the semiautonomous Danish territory. “Nobody’s going to fight the United States militarily over the future of Greenland,” Miller told Jake Tapper on CNN. “We live in a world, in the real world, Jake, that is governed by strength, that is governed by force, that is governed by power. These are the iron laws of the world since the beginning of time.” On Tuesday, the Trump White House reiterated the potential for military action against Greenland, telling Reuters: “The president and his team are discussing a range of options to pursue this important foreign policy goal, and of course, utilizing the U.S. military is always an option at the commander-in-chief’s disposal.” By Thursday, Trump was floating a plan to pay Greenlanders between $10,000 to $100,000 per person to convince them to secede from Denmark and join the United States. On January 3rd, Katie Miller—the wife of Stephen Miller—posted a meme of Greenland overlaid in American flag colors with the single word “SOON.” Notably, Katie Miller was an adviser and spokesperson for Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and then an employee of him directly before leaving to start a podcast. Katie Miller, the wife of psycho Stephen Miller, calling for taking Greenland.Trump is the perfect puppet for the Technocrats and helping fulfil the original Technocrats plan of the North American Technate which just so happens to include Greenland and Venezeula. https://t.co/L4hHT110L3 The fact that both Stephen and Katie Miller are publicly advocating for the US takeover of Greenland—given their proximity to Musk—is significant. Elon Musk’s grandfather, Joshua Haldeman, was a research director for Technocracy Incorporated of Canada and national chairman of the Social Credit Party. Musk is simply following in his grandfather’s footsteps as he and the numerous Technocrats surrounding Trump work to bring about the original vision of the American Technate. As The Last American Vagabond has been reporting for years, it has become increasing clear that we are witnessing the MAGA movement—which largely believes it is the “resistance” to the “globalist elite”—capitulate and make excuses as Trump stacks his administration with Technocrats, including members and attendees of the secretive Bilderberg Group, the World Economic Forum, and the WEF’s Young Global Leaders program. I outlined these connections in numerous articles in 2025, including Meet The Peter Thiel Acolytes in Donald Trump’s 2nd Administration, Meet the Man Whose Philosophy Has Influenced Peter Thiel and the Technocrats, and Welcome to the Palantir World Order. I highlighted the fact that under Donald Trump, two members of the steering committee of the Bilderberg Group—Peter Thiel and Alex Karp—are running Palantir and securing an increasing number of military-industrial complex contracts. This is yet another clear sign that Trump is not fighting the “deep state.” One prime example of this Technocratic deep state nexus is Michael Kratsios. Kratsios is one of dozens of Peter Thiel acolytes in the second Trump administration. He was appointed by Trump to serve as Science Adviser to the President and Director of the White House’s Office of Science and Technology Policy. Kratsios previously served in a similar role during the first Trump administration, as well as Acting Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, and policy specialist on artificial intelligence, drones, quantum computing, and cybersecurity. He also worked for two of Peter Thiel’s funds, Thiel Capital and Clarium Capital. In June 2025, Kratsios attended the Bilderberg meeting in Stockholm, Sweden. Why is @MichaelKratsios, Trump's Director of the White House Office of Science and Technology, attending Bilderberg? Remember, this is the same guy I reported has worked for two of Peter Thiel’s funds, Thiel Capital and Clarium Capital: https://t.co/toIOJG35LA pic.twitter.com/I2dEMGC7LU Kratsios is also part of Trump’s efforts to limit how states can regulate Artificial Intelligence. Speaking at the 2026 Consumer Electronics Show, he said the White House was preparing a legislative proposal to establish a national AI framework and prevent what he described as market fragmentation caused by inconsistent state rules. There is simply no denying that Donald Trump is helping usher in the Technocratic State backed by the likes of Palantir goons Peter Thiel and Alex Karp, Zionists, and modern-day Technocrats such as Elon Musk, David Sacks, and Howard Lutnick. What we are witnessing with Venezuela and Greenland is one more step in the completion of the American Technate and one step closer to the vision of a global government.

Shares are trading mixed in Asia after Wall Street broke a two-day losing streak, edging back toward record levels BANGKOK -- Asian shares were mixed Friday after Wall Street broke a two-day losing streak and edged back toward record levels, helped by advances for Big Tech companies like Nvidia. U.S. futures advanced and oil prices slipped. Tech shares regained momentum after Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., a major supplier to the industry, reported strong profits and investment plans. TSMC gained 3% early Friday and Taiwan's benchmark Taiex was up 1.9%. The frenzy around AI has sent Nvidia and other superstar stocks to dizzying heights, stirring criticism that their prices had shot too high. Nvidia rose 2.1% on Thursday after TSMC’s Chief Financial Officer Wendell Huang said it’s seeing “continued strong demand” in an encouraging signal for the entire AI industry. TSMC’s stock that trades in the United States rose 4.4% on Thursday. The gains also followed the signing of a U.S.-Taiwan trade deal involving $250 billion in new investments by Taiwan’s semiconductor and tech companies in the U.S. In exchange, the Trump administration will cut tariffs on Taiwanese goods. The deal aims to establish a strategic economic partnership and upgrade U.S. industrial infrastructure. In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 shed 0.3% to 53,936.17, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng gave up 0.6% to 26,770.56. The Shanghai Composite index lost 0.3% to 4,101.91. China is due to report its economic growth data for 2025 on Monday. Forecasts are for the economy to have expanded at about a 4.5% annual pace, slowing from earlier in the year. Elsewhere in Asia, South Korea's Kospi rose 0.9% to a record 4,840.74. The benchmark has been trading at record highs for weeks, helped by a recovery in confidence in AI-related shares. Samsung Electronics gained 3.5%. In Australia, the S&P/ASX 200 gained 0.5% to 8,903.90. India's Sensex rose 0.4%. Wall Street steadied on Thursday as stocks related to artificial-intelligence bounced back. The S&P 500 rose 0.3% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.6%. The Nasdaq composite rose 0.2% to 23,530.02. Easing oil prices also helped to calm investors' jitters. Early Friday, a barrel of benchmark U.S. crude cost $59.21, up 14 cents from a day earlier. It sank 4.6% on Thursday after Trump said he had heard “on good authority” that plans for executions in Iran had stopped amid widespread protests against the country’s leadership. Brent crude, the international standard, added 10 cents to $63.86 per barrel. It dropped 4.1% on Thursday. Financial markets took Trump's comments about Iran as a signal that tensions flaring above some of the world’s largest oil deposits could ease, which in turn could lower the possibility of disruptions to oil supplies. Earnings reporting season for big U.S. companies continued to pick up pace, meanwhile, with several more big financial companies delivering their results for the last three months of 2025. “As we dive into the heart of earnings season in the coming weeks, tech results will be scrutinized in far greater detail.,” Ipek Ozkardeskaya of Swissquote said in a commentary. “Concerns around circular AI deals, leverage and delayed returns on investment remain front of mind for investors. These are compounded by rising electricity and metals costs, higher memory-chip prices, and the risk of supply disruptions,” she said. BlackRock, the giant that’s now overseeing more than $14 trillion in investments, rose 5.9% after reporting stronger profit and revenue than analysts expected. Encouraging reports on the U.S. economy contributed to the upbeat mood. One said fewer workers applied for unemployment benefits last week in an indication layoffs may be slowing. Other reports said manufacturing was significantly stronger in the mid-Atlantic region and in New York state than economists had forecast. The stronger-than-expected data on the U.S. economy helped stocks of smaller companies to lead the market. Their profits can be tied more closely to the strength of the U.S. economy than their bigger, multinational rivals, and the Russell 2000 index rose 0.9%.

(AP Photo/Richard Drew) BANGKOK – Stocks edged a bit lower on Wall Street Friday as the first week of corporate earnings season ended with markets trading near record levels. The wobbly day for stocks closed out a week of similar movements for major indexes amid profit reports from banks and updates on inflation. Recommended Videos The S&P 500 fell 4.46 points, or 0.1%, to 6,940.01. It is sitting just below its record, which was set on Monday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 83.11 points, or 0.2%, to 49,359.33. The Nasdaq composite fell 14.63 points, or 0.1%, to 23,515.39. Each index notched weekly losses. Smaller company stocks fared better. The Russell 2000 eked out a 0.1%, while also notching a 2% gain for the week. Technology stocks were the strongest forces behind the market's moves throughout most of the day. Several big technology stocks made strong gains and helped offset losses elsewhere. Broadcom rose 2.5% and Micron Technology rose 7.8%. The semiconductor companies are among several Big Tech companies with outsized valuations that often push the market higher or lower. A handful of regional U.S. banks reported their earnings following mixed reports from their larger peers. Pittsburgh’s PNC jumped 3.8% after it beat Wall Street’s fourth-quarter targets, but Regions Financial fell 2.6% after reporting results that missed forecasts. Outside of the banking sector, transport company J.B. Hunt Transport Services fell 1% after reporting mixed quarterly financial results. The latest round of earnings updates from companies could help give Wall Street a better sense of how consumers are spending their money and how businesses are operating amid economic concerns brought on by inflation and tariffs. Results from the technology sector are being scrutinized by investors trying to figure out whether the high stock prices fueled by the craze around artificial intelligence are justified. “Despite the strong start to 2026, we would not be surprised if markets experience volatility in the coming weeks as fourth quarter earnings progress and the threat of escalating geopolitical tensions remains,” wrote Doug Beath, global equity strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, in a note to investors. Wall Street will have a broader mix of earnings to review next week, coming from airlines, industrial companies, and technology companies. United Airlines, 3M, and Intel are all scheduled to release their quarterly earnings results next week. Crude oil prices rose after dropping sharply on Thursday. The price of U.S. crude oil rose 0.4% to $59.44 and the price of Brent crude, the international standard, rose 0.6% to $64.13. Oil prices have been volatile amid widespread protests in Iran against that country’s leadership and President Donald Trump's warnings that the U.S. “will come to their rescue.” Gold prices, which have also been volatile this week, fell. Prices for the precious metal, often viewed as a safe haven amid economic and geopolitical uncertainty, fell 0.6%, but are still up more than 5% so far in January. Treasury yields moved higher in the bond market. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.23% from 4.17% late Thursday. The two-year Treasury yield, which more closely tracks expectations for what the Federal Reserve will do, rose to 3.60% from 3.57% late Thursday. The Fed's next policy meeting on interest rates is in two weeks, and Wall Street is betting that it will maintain its current benchmark interest rate. The central bank is trying to balance a slowing jobs market with stubbornly high inflation. Updates on inflation this week showed that prices remain above the Fed's 2% goal. The U.S. central bank will get one more update on inflation next week when the government releases the personal consumption expenditures price index, or PCE. It is the Fed's preferred measure for inflation. European markets fell, and markets in Asia were mixed. Taiwan's benchmark index rose 1.9% after its government signed a trade deal with the U.S. China, which claims the self-governed island as its own territory, protested the agreement. The deal with Taiwan comes amid an ongoing trade war between the U.S. and much of the world. Uncertainty over tariffs have raised concerns about inflation and economic damage because of higher costs for businesses and consumers. Canada is the latest to shift its partnerships because of the uncertainty. It has agreed to cut its 100% tariff on Chinese electric cars in return for lower tariffs on Canadian farm products as part of a break with the U.S. Tesla fell 0.2% and Rivian fell 2.3%.

Title: State Street rolls out new crypto tokenization tools

State Street said its new crypto platform would help clients build tokenized money market funds, exchange-traded funds, and products such as tokenized deposits and stablecoins. Cointelegraph in your social feed Multinational banking giant State Street has launched an institutional digital asset platform, aimed at helping businesses navigate the sector and launch a range of crypto products. State Street said on Thursday its platform aims to bridge traditional assets to crypto via tokenization and will support the creation of tokenized money market funds, exchange-traded funds, as well as products such as tokenized deposits and stablecoins. The platform will provide institutions with tokenization services, digital asset custody and access to a range of digital assets. “By pairing blockchain connectivity with robust controls and global servicing expertise, we’re enabling institutions to confidently embrace tokenization as part of their core strategy,” said Joerg Ambrosius, State Street’s president of investment services. Like other bank-led tokenization initiatives, the platform is initially targeted at institutional clients and remains subject to jurisdictional regulatory approvals Tokenization has become a key focus for traditional finance companies as they push to experiment with blockchain, which proponents say can improve liquidity.

State Street has $5.4 trillion worth of assets under management. The firm has been dipping its toes into the digital asset space for the past couple of years, with momentum growing significantly in 2025. In December, the firm teamed up with Galaxy Asset Management and Ondo Finance for a tokenized fund on Solana. The aim of the fund is to push cash sweep balance on blockchains to enable a 24/7 source of liquidity. Other finance managers, such as Fidelity, Franklin Templeton and JPMorgan, have also launched tokenized money-market funds, with many more traditional firms, including BlackRock, having also launched crypto-tied ETFs.

Title: BlackRock strengthens Bitcoin position after scooping up 6.6K BTC – Details

BlackRock’s ETF activity suggests demand is building even when the market looks quiet. BlackRock has made a major move in crypto, but not the kind most headlines suggest. When BlackRock’s IBIT ETF records a large single-day Bitcoin [BTC] purchase, many frame it as a bold corporate bet. However, in reality, BlackRock isn’t speculating with its own balance sheet. Instead, it is acting as an intermediary, pulling Bitcoin off the open market on behalf of pension funds, asset managers, and long-term institutional investors. In mid-January 2026, investor demand surged sharply. To meet that demand, BlackRock purchased nearly 6647 Bitcoin in one session. This steady accumulation has pushed BlackRock’s total Bitcoin holdings to roughly 781,000 BTC – Close to 4% of all Bitcoin currently in circulation. At this scale, BlackRock now ranks among the largest long-term holders in the world. Thus, as custodians move more of this Bitcoin into secure, offline storage, those coins have effectively exited the liquid market. Hence, fewer coins now remain available for active trading. This move is not just with Bitcoin, but also with Ethereum though. BlackRock recently added tens of thousands of Ethereum [ETH], while other large investors locked up Ethereum through staking. Staked ETH cannot move easily, further reducing supply on exchanges. Together, ETF accumulation and staking continue to tighten available supply and dampen short-term selling pressure. Despite this aggressive absorption, however, prices have not exploded upwards. In fact, at the time of writing, the altcoin was valued at close to $3,335 pn the price charts. Still, these price levels are much better than ones below $90,000 – Levels seen by BTC back in Q4 2025. Meanwhile, BlackRock’s IBIT and ETHA recorded inflows worth $648.4 million and $81.6 million, respectively. The latest surge came on the heels of another major accumulation spree by BlackRock. Over a short window, the firm quietly pulled close to $1 billion worth of cryptos off the open market. It moved 9,619 Bitcoin, valued at roughly $878 million, along with 46,851 Ethereum worth about $149 million, directly into custodial storage. All these moves, together, show that the crypto markets no longer revolve around short-term hype. Therefore, as 2026 unfolds, the real question isn’t whether institutions are involved. It’s whether enough liquid Bitcoin and Ethereum will remain on exchanges to meet their growing demand.
