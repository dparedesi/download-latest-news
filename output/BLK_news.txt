The U.S. had warned earlier that a ballistic missile strike from Iran was being prepared against the foreign ally. Later, the Iranian Mission to the United Nations said on Twitter (aka X) that Tehran's response “has been duly carried out.” Bitcoin’s price fell 3.2% to $61,300 amid the volley, hitting its lowest price in two weeks, though it has ticked back up to $62,200 as of this writing. The dip reflected a lackluster start to so-called Uptober, a period of historically seasonal strength for “risk assets” like stocks and crypto. Is the Uptober in the room with us right now? pic.twitter.com/FAzk7quFkI — Pop Punk (@PopPunkOnChain) October 1, 2024 While Bitcoin has gained traction among investors as a “store of value asset” against inflation, the coin hasn’t consistently performed well as a “flight to quality asset” during times of geopolitical conflict, Grayscale Investment’s Managing Director of Research Zach Pandl told Decrypt. “Investors who are concerned about high geopolitical risks are, for now, still reaching for the traditional instruments,” he said, pointing to physical gold and U.S. Treasury bonds. Despite Tuesday’s dip, Pandl added that Bitcoin’s correlation with risk assets could shift alongside Bitcoin’s adoption by countries in the coming years. “In the longer term, when Bitcoin is widely held around the world and a reserve asset for central banks and governments, it may also be a common flight-to-quality asset,” Pandl said. “But Bitcoin is still much earlier in its journey than treasury bonds or gold.” While bursts of geopolitical conflict have previously dented Bitcoin’s price, asset managers like BlackRock have recently highlighted Bitcoin’s ability to serve as a hedge. This month, the firm said Bitcoin can diversify against “geopolitical tensions, concerns over the state of U.S. debt and deficits, and increased political instability.” President Joe Biden said Sunday that an all-out-war in the Middle East must be avoided as Israeli airstrikes battered Lebanon, killing dozens of people, per the Associated Press. The strikes followed last week’s killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, a major blow to the Iran-backed militant group and political party in Lebanon. Bitcoin: “We’re a global reserve of value like digital gold, that you want to hold in uncertain times” Bitcoin during WWIII: *Dumps* https://t.co/vVVLXMuhYG — Adam Cochran (adamscochran.eth) (@adamscochran) October 1, 2024 The escalation between Israel and Iran caused Bitcoin to sell off “sharply,” according to André Dragosch, Bitwise’s European Head of Research. But he said on Twitter (aka X) Tuesday that Bitcoin has “historically performed relatively well following major geopolitical risk events,” adding that “geopolitical news should generally be faded.” Tuesday’s unease was reflected in crude oil prices, as WTI spiked 3.6% past $70 a barrel. Meanwhile, the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) rose 0.5%, reversing weakness seen in the dollar’s strength since mid-September. Gold jumped 1.3% to $2,670 per ounce. Stocks were down, however, alongside leading cryptocurrencies. If rising oil prices translate into rising consumer prices, Pandl said the Federal Reserve is unlikely to abandon its easing campaign. He contrasted supply shocks with the possibility of persistent demand from China’s oil-hungry economy post-stimulus. “I think it would be likely that the Fed would look through any temporary increase in inflation,” he said. “A more important consideration could be [...] the huge stimulus that we've seen from the Chinese government in the last couple of weeks.” Bitcoin’s price plunged in April alongside geopolitical conflict in the Middle East after Israel struck Iran with a barrage of missiles. The dip to $60,000 was preceded a week earlier by missile and drone strikes in the region that also rattled Bitcoin’s price. In February 2022, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine had an instantaneous impact on the crypto market. Bitcoin’s price dropped 9% to around $35,000, as $200 million was swiftly wiped away from the global market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin’s negative performance following geopolitical risk events is quite common, Bitwise's Dragosch told Decrypt in a statement. At the same time, Bitcoin’s track record suggests they have short-term impact on the asset’s price before exhibiting “significantly positive performance.” Dragosch referenced research he published with ETC Group earlier this year, which found that Bitcoin saw outsized returns following geopolitical risk events in the past, from France launching airstrikes on ISIS targets in Syria in 2017 to the aftermath of Osama bin Laden’s death in 2011. The research discussed how Bitcoin’s resistance to censorship and lack of counterparty risk align with the characteristics of safe-haven assets. Additionally, Bitcoin’s newfound scarcity with each so-called halving could bolster its performance relative to gold. “It is still a risky asset but its character will likely continue to change over the long run with every halving and increasing scarcity,” Dragosch said. “Bitcoin has evolved from a very risky asset to a safer asset over the past years.” Edited by Andrew Hayward Editor's note: This story was updated after publications with additional analyst comments and detail.

Title: BlackRock’s Larry Fink sounds off on investors expecting huge Fed rate cuts
URL: https://nypost.com/2024/10/01/business/blackrocks-larry-fink-sounds-off-on-investors-expecting-huge-fed-rate-cuts/
Time Published: 2024-10-01T18:23:35Z
Full Content:
BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said on Tuesday investors are wrong if they think the Fed will make massive interest rate cuts later this year because the billionaire money man believes the US economy will continue to grow. Fink dismissed market predictions that rates will be slashed further through the end of year after Chairman Jerome Powell lowered them by half a percentage point two weeks ago. It was the first reduction since 2020 and a bigger-than-expected cut as Western economies emerge from the aftermath of the global coronavirus pandemic. “I do believe there’s room for easing more,” the boss of the investment giant that manages at least $9 trillion of assets told Bloomberg TV in an interview. “I see more policies by more governments that tend to be more inflationary. With that in mind, it is hard for me to see another 200 basis points of a decline in short rates.” A cut of 200 basis points by Fed officials between now and the end of 2024 would amount to a reduction of two percentage points from its current level of 4.75%-5%. Economists are already pointing to Friday’s jobs report as a key piece of data that could alter the Fed’s policy path. If the unemployment rate rises noticeably or hiring stumbles, officials could consider a sharper rate cut later this year. Using a term for a slowing or stagnant economy that can eventually tip into recession, Fink added: “I don’t see any landing. “We are going to continue to grow. There are segments of the economy that are struggling. There are segments that are doing really well,” he said. “We are going to grow at 2 or 3%. Lower interest rates are aimed at making it less expensive for businesses and households to borrow and therefore spend more freely in the hope of boosting economic growth. But overly aggressive cuts can pump excessive money into the economy, potentially stoking inflation – the rise in goods and services over time – once more. Fink, the founder of the world’s largest asset manager, pointed to stronger corporate earnings as an indication that the US economy was in better shape than some commentators suggest. He also took a dig at America’s corporate titans that were still doing extensive business in China because of how Beijing was supporting Russia by buying more of its oil and gas supplies. “Ukraine is at our doorsteps here and I’m surprised that there’s not a larger questioning or demanding — you’re supporting our enemy,” the top money man told Bloomberg. “There should be a cost to that.” Fink has an estimated net worth of $1.2 billion, according to Forbes, and is a longtime Democrat Party donor. BlackRock has in recent years been a vocal cheerleader for the Biden Administration’s policies on Environmental Social Governance, more commonly known as ESG. It the practice of encouraging major firms and investors to be mindful of climate change as part of their business models, but also encourage diversity in corporate boardrooms. Fink has clashed in recent months with fellow Wall Street titan Boaz Weinstein whose Saba Capital Management has launched an activist raid on a series of BlackRock funds this year. Saba, which has acquired sizeable stakes in at least 10 of the funds, contends that BlackRock’s mismanagement is depressing the funds’ profitability. Weinstein’s investment firm has roughly $5 billion of assets under management at present.

Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Bitcoin (BTC) crashed in tandem with stock markets on Oct. 1 as tensions continued to escalate in the Middle East after Israel announced ground operations in Lebanon, which has prompted Iran to take action. The official account of Israel Defense Forces on X shared at 4:36 P.M. UTC that Iran was firing rockets at Israeli territory. Additionally, reports claim that Iran is likely to send a second wave of missiles targeting Israel in the ensuing hours. As a result, over $489 million was liquidated over the past 24 hours, with the majority of liquidations — $312 million — occurring within the past four hours, according to Coinglass data. Long liquidations accounted for $416.6 million of the total, while short liquidations amounted to roughly $73 million. According to CryptoSlate data, BTC was trading at $61,598 as of press time, down 3% over the past day. Major altcoins displayed heavier corrections following the news. Ethereum (ETH) was down 4.31% as of press time and trading at $2,490, while Solana (SOL) was down over 5.51% and trading at $146.8. Toncoin (TON) and Dogecoin (DOGE) registered the worst performance, tumbling 6.2% and 7.3%, respectively, to $5.33 and $0.1063.

Jeroen Blokland, founder of the Blokland Smart Multi-Asset Fund, stated on X that investors are “literally selling” BTC to buy gold amid the intensification of the conflict. However, he added that Bitcoin’s average return as a hedge against geopolitical events has proven to be a good decision since 2020. Citing a BlackRock report, Blokland highlighted that BTC outpaced the 60-day returns of SPX and gold during the US-Iran conflict and Covid outbreak in 2020, the deflagration of war between Russia and Ukraine in 2022, and the US banking crisis in 2023.

Title: Here’s The Actual Reason Why The World’s Second-Largest Asset Manager Vanguard Snubbed Bitcoin ETFs
URL: https://zycrypto.com/heres-the-actual-reason-why-the-worlds-second-largest-asset-manager-vanguard-snubbed-bitcoin-etfs/
Time Published: 2024-10-01T16:02:04Z
Full Content:
Back in 2017, legendary investor Jack Bogle infamously cautioned investors to “avoid Bitcoin like the plague”. Roughly seven years later, Vanguard has still ignited the ire of crypto enthusiasts by sticking to the conservative investment principles of its late founder. Despite the euphoria unleashed by chief rival BlackRock being among the issuers of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on American stock exchanges, Vanguard still won’t touch the new BTC products with a ten-foot pole. Bloomberg’s top ETF analyst Eric Balchunas has revealed why Vanguard, which currently holds approximately $7.2 trillion in assets under management, continues to shun Bitcoin spot investment vehicles, unlike its peers. According to Balchunas, the Pennsylvania-based company has traditionally steered clear of commodities, which Bogle dismissed as “total speculation” since they are “only worth what someone else will pay you.” Bogle favored assets with intrinsic cash flow over mere commodities like Bitcoin. Even as billions flowed into the newly-launched spot Bitcoin ETFs, Vanguard has maintained that it has no plans to offer its clients any crypto-related products. The Bloomberg ETF pundit described Vanguard’s paternalistic decision to block Bitcoin ETFs on its enormous trading platform as “a bit nanny state-ish.” He contends that their “highly intelligent” investors should be able to decide for themselves whether or not they want to gain direct exposure to the burgeoning crypto. Vanguard’s rejection of Bitcoin and crypto in general stands in contrast to its industry peers. BlackRock, Fidelity Investments, and Invesco have all debuted spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs this year, while major US banks like JPMorgan are serving as authorized participants for the products. Meanwhile, earlier this year, Vanguard named Salim Ramji, a former BlackRock executive who oversaw the company’s launch of its Bitcoin ETF (iShares Bitcoin Trust), as its new CEO. This move triggered chatter on social media that the asset manager might change its stance. However, despite his BTC-friendliness at BlackRock, Ramji quickly poured water on the idea that he has intentions for Vanguard to offer its clientele trading access to any of the multiple spot Bitcoin products on the market. That being said, despite the asset management behemoth eschewing Bitcoin ETFs, it still has indirect exposure in the dominant cryptocurrency by market cap as it is presently the second-biggest institutional holder of MicroStrategy — the world’s largest corporate holder of Bitcoin.

Title: Major Bitcoin Miner CEO Reveals Unveils His Plan For AI
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2024/10/01/major-bitcoin-miner-ceo-reveals-unveils-his-plan-for-ai/
Time Published: 2024-10-01T14:36:06Z
Full Content:
MARA CEO Fred Thiel thinks that retail investors are giving small competitors too much credit for artificial intelligence plays that will not pay off for years. He has a vision for his company that plays to its core strengths. Marathon CEO Fred Thiel is making a play for the AI market on his terms Fred Thiel is the Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer of MARA, bringing over 35 years of extensive experience in the technology sector. In this discussion we cover a wide range of issues including how Marathon is adapting to the wave of smaller miners gravitating towards artificial intelligence, what separates his firm from some of the other pure-play miners, and how U.S. politics and the upcoming presidential election will affect the outlook for the mining industry. Forbes: Can you give an overview of how you've tried to position Marathon Digital Holdings within the world of bitcoin mining? Fred Thiel: We look at ourselves as sitting at the point of convergence between energy transformation and digital infrastructure. From a bitcoin mining perspective, we're the largest of the publicly traded miners today, operating 13 sites across four continents. We use a variety of different technologies and we're the only one of the large bitcoin miners that has a fully vertically integrated tech stack. What that means is we operate our own mining pool, which is what orchestrates all our miners around the world and is the interface to the Bitcoin blockchain. All the other miners use third-party pools that are either Foundry, for example, or Chinese pools. We also operate our own firmware, which runs in miners and then we have developed and designed our own cooling infrastructure. We have single-phase and dual-phase liquid cooling, both of which don't use water, so that is totally water-free, and this is a really exciting area as we move into providing digital infrastructure to the AI industry because it's the exact same infrastructure that's used by both industries. The other thing that is unique is we cofounded a company called Auradine, which is the only U.S. bitcoin mining ASIC manufacturer. Their miners can support multiple chip failures and still run so they can operate in wider temperature ranges. So what does that all add up to? To me, it means as a miner we have access to technologies that not necessarily other miners do and we continue to press the envelope on deploying that technology. Our data center in Abu Dhabi, which is all liquid immersion cooling, is a preeminent site. There are two data centers, a total of 250 megawatts, that have 99.8% uptime running in a very harsh environment, which is obviously the Middle East desert next to a body of water. It's very humid so liquid cooling is the only way to go. Our strategy initially was one of being asset light. We focused on just growing rapidly by hosting with third parties. Then earlier this year we shifted to vertically integrating and we acquired 54% of our capacity’s infrastructure, and as we continue to grow in coming years that number will get closer and closer to 100%. We tripled our capacity in 2023, we'll double it again this year and we'll continue to grow at a pretty great rate. Lastly, we're the second largest holder of bitcoin of publicly traded companies in the U.S. and our strategic focus really is to amass as much bitcoin as we can. That's our core treasury asset and we do that through mining and also going into the markets and buying opportunistically when it makes sense. Forbes: What metrics do you pay the most attention to and how does the development and investment you detailed help give you a leg up on the pure bitcoin miners? Thiel: A couple of things. I talked about how we operate 13 sites on four continents. We don't have a concentration in a particular region or state. Riot Platforms is 100% concentrated in Texas today. They're trying to solve that by acquiring Bitfarms and then they've acquired another small site, I think in Kentucky. CleanSpark was heavily focused on Georgia. Now they're focusing on Kentucky as well. The challenge with being focused on just one area is you're very susceptible to your energy utility and energy market pricing in that region. In the case of Riot, they have the double whammy of two big sites in Texas and you have curtailment issues, weather issues and community issues, which in Texas are not small things. In the case of CleanSpark, they operate lots of very small sites. Operationally that is a very different issue because now you have to have people spread all over managing these disparate small sites and it may mean you don't have the opportunity to really aggregate the scale and get the benefits of scale in the same way. But Marathon is operating on different continents, so we also have the ability to avoid the risk of regulatory regime issues in the U.S. For example, in the Biden budget, there were attacks specifically on energy used by bitcoin mining. The Harris administration seems like they are befriending AI, but they are still going to be antagonistic to bitcoin mining. By the way, you can't give AI energy at one price and not give bitcoin mining energy at the same price. Not only would the industry attack that issue, but it's a type of commercial discrimination, which could be viewed as illegal. But more importantly, there is a huge symbiosis between AI and bitcoin mining because AI workloads vary just like demand on the grid varies and bitcoin miners have a unique ability to synchronize their load to AI miners loads such that you don't get this huge variance of demand on the grid. So when you marry bitcoin miners and AI operators together, you get a much better grid profile. You have the ability to stabilize the load, and you have an ability to use more of the intermittent energy—solar, wind—than AI can use. If you look at our technology piece, operating our own pool, it's very transparent to our investors; they can see every block that we win. By operating your own pool, you do a couple of things. One is you pay a pool operator a percentage of your winnings for them to operate the pool. It's 1% or 2% depending on the size of the miner; we don't have to do that. Then we have systems like Slipstream, a non-standard block submittal service that people in the Ordinals world really love. It allows us to get higher fees for submitting blocks to the network than the normal mempool would pay, so that gives us additional revenues on top of the traditional transaction fees that we get. We also have a Layer 2 called Anduro, which people are now starting to develop applications on. Forbes: Can you speak a little more about how Anduro is constructed? Thiel: It's a Bitcoin L2 that is essentially a clone of the Bitcoin network. It can process transactions much faster. It can do things that you can't really do as easily on the L1 of Bitcoin, but it anchors all its security, and it's pegged to the L1. You can, for example, do transactions in a much easier way than you can with lightning. Lightning requires you to open channels and close channels. This is a true sidechain, so you could build a digital identity network on it. You could build a MLS for real estate on it. You could build a transaction processing system for credit card remittances, whatever you may want to have. One of the applications that’s been built on it, which will be released soon, is called Alys, and Alys is a full EMV system from the Ethereum world that lets you take an application built for Ethereum and port it directly to Bitcoin. And then going back to our liquid cooling technology and the ASIC technology, we have technology advantages in that we can build miners specific to the use case. So in Finland for example, we have a small data center that heats 11,000 homes. How are we doing that? We're doing it through district heating by capturing heat from the miners. We have the ability to build custom miners for use cases. We recently made an investment in a company in San Diego, and what they do is they go in and they over-dimension solar systems for homes with solar panels and batteries and they use the excess capacity to mine bitcoin. Realize that solar energy has zero marginal cost, and so if you put 10 kilowatts of panels on a house versus six kilowatts of panels, the only difference in cost is the capital expenditure for the panels. Then all that extra energy can be used for bitcoin mining. More importantly, you can also heat water with the heat from the bitcoin miners. And what they do is they provision this and then they sell electricity to the consumer at 25% below market price. That fits into this model of the long tail of bitcoin mining, which is highly decentralized bitcoin mining, putting it out at the edge and leveraging zero-cost energy. So what you'll see from us over the next couple of years is a move towards the cost to mine being covered by services we're providing to the parties with which we’re partnered. That’s an obtuse way of saying we believe–and we're in the process of signing agreements with large partners–that people will pay us for the benefits of marrying bitcoin mining to different applications. And in doing so, our cost of energy will go towards zero. Forbes: Hash price continues to go down, and your stock price, along with other pure-play miners, has trailed that of Bitcoin and some of the other smaller miners that have made more direct overtures towards AI. What do you think of those things? Thiel: A couple of things. At the beginning of this year you started to see the shift from bitcoin miners to kind of MicroStrategy and the ETFs because of the coming halving. Any miner was suddenly going to produce half as much bitcoin, and so their costs were going to go up. Essentially, they'd be less profitable, so it's only logical to think that their market cap would be impacted. At the same time, MicroStrategy was out there buying $2 billion worth of bitcoin, and that became very attractive for people to do. The investment community–I'll go away from the retail side for a minute–the hedge funds, the volatility investors, love bitcoin mining because you get a lot more alpha than you did just by investing in bitcoin. It's the same reason Warren Buffett invested in gold miners versus gold because he likes the fact that when gold price runs up, gold miners’ cost to extract doesn't necessarily go up. The same generally holds with bitcoin miners. There's a six to nine-month lag as bitcoin price runs up before the cost to mine really starts jumping because the cost of mine is driven by either energy costs or global hash rate and the difficulty rate going up. And so if you have to go buy new capacity, buy new miners and deploy them, there's a six to nine month lag in that process. So you have this period of high profit when bitcoin price moves quickly. When bitcoin price does not move quickly, it moves sideways, buying spot bitcoin is much smarter and that also gives you an insight into our HODL strategy and why we go and buy bitcoin in the market sometimes. But MicroStrategy and Marathon and the other big miners have options that there's an options market. And so the ball players love it. They can do all sorts of very creative stuff and if you look at the stock prices, they tend to move pretty much in a pattern where they move up at the beginning of the week and down at the back half of the week. And that all has to do with selling calls and then buying back the calls after you short the stock. You can see very specific trading patterns for all the companies. The smaller guys were generally ignored previously, and now people have said the big guys are well-valued, and the smaller guys should be valued similarly on a per exhash basis. I think they're giving the small guys too much credit. Look at Cipher, they've signed up 350 megawatts of new stuff, but it's not going to come online for 12 to 18 months, yet the stock price goes up. So that's retail chasing that. Our investor makeup interestingly has changed this year in that in the first quarter we had about 39% institutional and now we're up closer to 60%. The institutional investors are seeing the value in our story because of how we position the transition to AI. I do not think that a miner like TerraWulf or Hut8 can go and build and operate a hosting center for AI very effectively. It is not the same thing as running a bitcoin mining site. Forbes: What is the investor makeup? Are these buy and hold investors? Thiel: Our single biggest shareholder today is BlackRock. They hold 13% to 14% of our shares, in both their managed and unmanaged funds. Same thing with Fidelity. You have basically BlackRock, Fidelity, Vanguard, and then some long list of others after that. But I think what we're certainly seeing when we're out talking to investors is the people who are starting to talk to us with interest are the ones who are looking at what we're doing around AI infrastructure and how that opportunity is very different from traditional bitcoin mining. Traditional bitcoin mining is a zero-sum game, and every four years, you get slapped in the face with a price increase effectively. As you start looking at digital infrastructure in the AI space, you now have the benefit of providing technology or services to these hyperscalers. The area we believe is most interesting is AI at the edge, which is all about inference. The inference marketplace is still two to three years from growing a lot because people are still busy building these LLMs [large language models]. If you read Sam Altman's white paper that he published recently, basically, his argument is you have to invest heavily in LLMs so that you have essentially something for inference to query. The way I put it is LLMs are the brain and inference is how you make money off of AI. Inference is the digital twin that is sitting in a factory, running a factory, and leveraging a model that sits up in the cloud, and the model is updated daily, sent back down to the edge, and it operates at the edge. There will be tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of these modular data centers that do inference at the edges spread all over the place. Forbes: Let’s talk more about the HODL strategy. You've hinted at some very strategic decisions that affect how you leverage your balance sheet when updating equipment and making investments versus procuring bitcoin on the spot market. Can you break that down a little more? Thiel: When you are investing in bitcoin mining, you are betting on the fact that you will be able to produce bitcoin at a lower cost than you could acquire it in the open marketplace. So if I'm going to spend $100 million dollars and buy bitcoin, I get that bitcoin tomorrow, and then I get the benefit of its price appreciation over the hold period, and let's just say I'm going to hold it for 36 months. If you assume it will go up 20%-plus a year, you have that price appreciation in the bitcoin, and your basis is today's price. If you are going to go into the mining business, your bet is I'm going to invest $100 million dollars in infrastructure that will likely go live in about 12 months on average. It could be shorter if you're buying an existing site that's running and you're just going to replace the miners. And so you need to over the following 24 months, mine not just as much bitcoin as you acquired where you bought the bitcoin today, but enough bitcoin so you're also covering your cost of power, etc., such that at the end of the period of time you end up with more dollar value of bitcoin than you did just by buying it today. What that requires is a belief in what the price of bitcoin is going to do in the long term. And so when we have access to capital, there are times when we will choose to go into the market and buy bitcoin versus invest it in adding more mining capacity because sometimes there's a lag in how long it takes for us to deploy the capital when we're adding mining capacity. Forbes: You recently met with Donald Trump. Can you share your experiences or takeaways from that round table? Thiel: Former President Trump has been very well briefed and understands the value proposition that bitcoin provides to the U.S. as a country and the opportunity that bitcoin mining provides for the U.S. to be the dominant player in processing bitcoin transactions and securing the bitcoin blockchain. It's a little bit like the gold reserves the U.S. holds. The U.S. holds 40% of the gold reserves of the world because in the event there was ever an attack on the U.S. dollar, you have the gold reserves that you can use. The U.S. also happens to have custody of the majority of other countries’ gold. As you know, Russia got on the wrong side of that with the sanctions program. Many nations have figured out that with the weaponization of the dollar, they need to be able to hold assets in something other than the dollar. So they're now evaluating holding things in amongst other things, bitcoin as well as gold and other assets. And not that they will hold all their reserves in bitcoin, but they may decide to hold somewhere between 1% to 10%, depending on the country and their risk profile. I don't think the Saudis, if you were to talk to them, would say that they consider the rupee, the ruble or some of these other currencies as good reserve assets, and so they're still going to put their faith in the dollar. But they want to have a hedge, and they want to have something that provides a risk-adjusted return potentially better than just placing their money in dollar assets because a lot of the countries today outside of the U.S. are being very cautious about their buying of Treasury bills, for example. The sixth largest buyer of Treasury bills today is Tether [according to Investopedia]. It's not a country. It's a stablecoin. So what you're starting to see is people who want to have dollar-denominated stablecoins end up being the biggest holders of Treasury bills. Then you have to look at bonds and who wants to hold those? The Chinese certainly aren't buying them anymore nor are a lot of other countries. So if a sovereign is going to hold bitcoin, then the sovereign has to be guaranteed that they can transact it. Because if all bitcoin mining happens in the U.S. or the U.S. has a significant amount of bitcoin mining going on, then the U.S., in theory, could sanction a country by forcing U.S. bitcoin miners through legal regulation to not mine certain transactions because they're on OFAC sanction lists, for example. That could restrict somebody from transacting where, let's just say you had 60% of mining in the U.S., well, six out of 10 blocks, meaning somebody would only be able to transact in four out of any 10 blocks. That happens, and if you've got enough countries in the world to go against one country, you could potentially almost block them out. So sovereigns who are going to hold bitcoin have a need to have mining in their country. Bhutan is a great example. Bhutan holds $1 billion of bitcoin. They also have a lot of mining in their country. El Salvador now has stated that they no longer need third-party debt because they mine and hold bitcoin. So the U.S. should hold bitcoin just like they hold gold, and the U.S. should ensure that a certain percentage of the global hashrate comes from the U.S. so that all the bitcoin held in the U.S. by ETFs and these other funds can be transacted if need be. Forbes: Trump has said that he would like to see all remaining bitcoin mined in the U.S. That might be just politicking more than a serious policy statement, but I'm interested in your thoughts, given what you just mentioned. Thiel: I'm not going to put words in his mouth, but I think he views it as strategic importance for the U.S. to be a dominant player in bitcoin mining. And I think sometimes when he says dominant, he'll say, we have to be the end all. He wants that in the way of bitcoin mining and in the U.S. holding bitcoin reserves just like the gold aspect. You've seen him recently talk about if the U.S. were to hold a lot of bitcoin it could potentially appreciate to a point that it could pay for part of the debt or even all the debt. Representative Paulina Luna, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. and others are all believers in these programs. We think it's certainly a very wise choice because there will only ever be 21 million bitcoin. So it's just a question of who will own them over what period of time. Being shareholders in and having cofounded the only U.S. ASIC manufacturer for bitcoin mining, we’re certainly big believers in bitcoin miners made in the USA. You could argue that Chinese companies make 75% of the bitcoin miners made in the world today. I'm not saying that they're trying to do anything bad, but it does provide them an ability to essentially somewhat control the supply and the pricing of bitcoin miners. Forbes: That concentration can be dangerous in anything. Thiel: Exactly. So that's why we're big advocates. Regardless of who wins the presidential election, there may be opportunities to do something about that from a tariff perspective. Forbes: Have you had any interactions with the Harris campaign? Thiel: We have talked with the head of the DNC. We have talked with all sorts of senators and the Harris team does not want to engage with us. They have engaged with the AI industry. My belief is that, unfortunately, Senator Warren and her anti-crypto army have a fairly strong lock on some of the policy decisions that the Harris team is evaluating. Certainly, President Biden wanted to apply a tax to bitcoin mining as part of his budget. Part of this is they just don't understand the environmental benefit that bitcoin mining brings and the fact that it does not add additional fossil fuel requirements, it actually helps subsidize the renewable energy side of the world. And if they understood that, I think they would be willing to listen. But there are many forces rallied against us for political reasons on that side of the aisle that I wish didn't exist. Forbes: When did you start imprinting “made in the USA” in the blocks that you mine and why did you do that? Thiel: It was around the 4th of July [actual date was July 31]. It's a way for people to know if that block is mined in the U.S. or if it was mined offshore. Offshore entities control the majority of bitcoin pools. We're one of the few bitcoin pools that is not. We believe some people prefer transacting and putting their transactions into blocks that are mined in the U.S. Forbes: Are you ever worried that there could be a certain premium on bitcoins mined in the U.S. versus those elsewhere? Could that potentially impact the fungibility of any of these assets? Thiel: If you filter on OFAC, that doesn't impact the fungibility because you're not filtering bitcoins; you’re filtering wallets. How to look at it is somebody's bank account is on an OFAC list. The dollars in the bank account are on the list. It's the account, so the account can't transact. It's not that the bitcoin it holds is tainted. You may remember back in 2021, when we launched our pool, it originally had OFAC filtering turned on. Forbes: You’ve mentioned in the past that mining of Kaspa is a way to diversify. How much Kaspa do you have and are you continuing to mine it? Thiel: We continue to mine kaspa. We've grown our capacity a handful of times since we first announced that we were doing it. It's dissimilar from bitcoin in that it's a much smaller market cap and pool of liquidity. And so you can't just add exahashes and grow. You have to be very careful because there isn't a lot of liquidity compared to bitcoin. We mine enough so that we are not an overwhelming amount of the hashrate on the Kaspa network, but it is more profitable to mine than bitcoin on a per kilowatt hour basis. So if I invest a kilowatt of energy towards bitcoin, my profit using S21s could be anywhere from 5 to 8 cents depending on my cost of energy per kilowatt hour. In the case of kaspa, it's anywhere from 35 cents to a dollar. I can take kaspa, I can sell it and I can buy bitcoin or hold it. Kaspa has had some very strong price appreciation lately. So we've had a HODL strategy around some of the kaspa. Forbes: I published a list of what we called crypto billion dollar zombies in the magazine in March. Kaspa was mentioned as one of them. We saw the mining and we know it's similar to bitcoin, but it's hard to ascertain real discernible use for it beyond just people mining it and then sending it back and forth. Any more thoughts about Kaspa you'd like to share? Thiel: Kaspa as a technology is very interesting. It is a webchain versus a blockchain. It's web of blocks versus a linear line of blocks, and Kaspa has a very fast transaction speed. It also has a very high emissions decline. So it goes from emitting a lot of kaspa at the front end and then that subsidy drops very rapidly down. And so kaspa mining will likely not be a long-term business, but as long as we can mine it profitably and there's a good liquid market for it, then we just view it as a great source of revenues. Forbes: Is there anything I didn't ask you that’s at the top of your mind you'd like to share? Thiel: One thing that could be of interest to readers is that one of the primary drivers for the hashrate growth has been the upgrade cycle. If you take 30 watt per terrahash machines and replace them with 15 watt per terrahash machines, you just double your hashrate. Now that the upgrade cycle is finished, we’re entering a phase where people have to add actual capacity. I think you're still going to see global hashrate inching up, but you won't see the step function change that you saw. In 2023 hashrate doubled, then we had a halving in early 2024, and then you had all this hashrate come online [later]. We‘re pushing 700 exahash today. I think if anything, what you're going to see is bitcoin is going to continue to push sideways. We're seeing an institutionalization of bitcoin–ETFs have come on board; you now can do options on ETFs; you now have Morgan Stanley's 15,000 wealth advisors soliciting for bitcoin. We're still in the early days of this and you're now going to have hopefully the repeal or the reversal or the number of exemptions to SAB121, and you're going to see banks being able to custody bitcoin in addition to BNY Mellon, which means you can then start doing leverage, etc. You're going to build a lot of liquidity. With all those, what should be demand drivers? You still see institutional buyers sniping to buy bitcoin. They're sitting on the sidelines. They wait for a dip and they buy a dip. They are not in the market hurrying up, forcing the price up. So until there is a catalyst that drives the price of bitcoin up and maybe the election is the catalyst, I don't think we're going to see bitcoin price move up dramatically. Forbes: Thank you.

India's push into semiconductors comes as more U.S. chipmakers set their sights on India. Nvidia, AMD, Micron are among the U.S. companies that have pledged to expand in the country. "I'm in touch with the Micron CEO regularly, and they are making good progress," Goyal said. Goyal added that Indian behemoth Tata and other domestic companies are working to make India's semiconductor dream a reality. It's unlikely India will manufacture the most cutting-edge chips without the expertise of companies like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and Samsung which build some of the world's most advanced chips. "It is a tough job, but we have the talent, we have the skills," said Goyal. The minister referenced a recent trip to Silicon Valley where he visited several U.S. semiconductor companies and "saw tons of Indians working on the shop floor [and] on management teams," recounts Goyal. The minister, spearheading U.S. corporation expansion efforts under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, is confident India will be able to deliver the first chip by 2026-2027. Apple has already found success in India as it has looked to diversify its supply chain away from China. Goyal says 14% of the world's iPhones are manufactured in India, with that number "expected to grow." Apple increased assembly in the country in the last two years while boosting its retail presence to attract new iPhone buyers. And according to Goyal, Indian customers are increasingly opting for the more expensive iPhones. Apple has also begun manufacturing other products, including iPads, AirPods and Apple Watches in the country. "They're increasing production," Goyal added. Apple's expansion efforts in India have brought 150,000 jobs across manufacturing facilities in India, making it the biggest employer in the country's electronics industry, according to India's Commerce department. An Apple spokesperson was not immediately available to comment. Apple's foray into India comes amid ongoing growth challenges in China. On the recent bout of optimism around China's economic story and the latest stimulus measures, Goyal suggested that India's success is not predicated on China's troubles. "India… is not dependent on China. We stand on our own competencies, on our capabilities, and we believe we an offering that is far superior to China," said Goyal. Goyal met with a few Wall Street investors on Monday including executives from BlackRock, Warburg Pincus and KKR. Goyal said almost all the U.S. private equity players are looking to build and develop data centers across the country. Google, Microsoft and Nvidia are among the tech companies that are bringing artificial intelligence expertise to India, which Modi's government has been receptive to. But analysts warn that India must continue tackling larger issues including poor infrastructure, bureaucracy and red tape that have slowed down corporate expansion plans. Got a confidential news tip?

Title: ‘Bayer’s Toxic Trails’, The Global Lobbying of an Agrochemical Giant. EU’s Reapproval of Herbicide Glyphosate
URL: https://www.globalresearch.ca/bayers-toxic-trails-safety-food-farming-system/5869053
Time Published: 2024-10-01T13:52:32Z
Full Content:
The Corporate Europe Observatory (CEO) has rendered a great public service by very recently publishing a report titled ‘Bayer’s Toxic Trails’ which reveals how the German agrochemical giant Bayer has been lobbying hard to promote glyphosate and GMOs, or trying to “capture public policy to pursue its private interests.” This report, written by Joao Camargo and Hans Van Scharen, follows Bayer’s toxic trail as “it maintains monopolistic control of the seed and pesticides markets, fights off regulatory challenges to its toxic products, tries to limit legal liability, and exercises political influence.” This CEO report tells us that German multinational Bayer is one of the biggest pharmaceutical and agricultural companies in the world, employing over 100,000 people globally. Despite facing very extensive legal actions relating to very serious health problems caused by its high hazard products, it has plans “to stay afloat in a volatile future – from pushing glyphosate and new GMOs, to claiming its agricultural model is climate smart.” . Screenshot from CEO . The CEO report says on the basis of its extensive study that “the company’s general modus operandi is to cosy up to different political regimes or carefully generate political pressure to push through its products and its monopoly model, using market power, size, financial assets and lobbying as key tools.” As the CEO report tells us, Bayer has been in the headlines again recently because of the EU’s re-approval of the controversial herbicide glyphosate for another 10 years. This has happened despite the fact that “Glyphosate has come under heavy scrutiny over the past decade, since the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC, a World Health Organization agency) classified the company’s bestselling pesticide as “probably carcinogenic to humans”. In the US Bayer has recently been ordered to pay US$2.25 billion in compensation to a single plaintiff due to cancer linked to use of the pesticide (later cut to US$400 million by a judge).” “In total, so far, Bayer has faced over 170,000 lawsuits associated with its pesticide Roundup, which glyphosate is a main ingredient of. As of 2024 the company also estimates that there are still over 60,000 pending Roundup lawsuits. According to US law firm Wisner Baum, roughly 60 per cent of lawsuits have been resolved through verdicts in individual cases worth billions, or via a collective Roundup settlement agreement worth approximately US$11 billion. As a result the company’s stock continues to fall: it has dropped 70 percent since the summer of 2018, when it acquired the giant agrochemical glyphosate producer Monsanto for €63 billion.” However, the report says, “Bayer is pursuing a business model of increasing monopoly control over chemicals and seeds. After the Bayer-Monsanto and other mergers, just four companies ended up controlling 60 percent of the world seed market. Analysis shows that Bayer is the leading company in the global seed market, with a 17 percent share. It is also a dominant player in the chemical crop protection market. As a result, it appears determined to undermine key aspects of the EU’s beleaguered Green Deal. And even where it finds obstacles, for example when its products are deemed too toxic to sell for use in Europe, it will still produce them here and instead export the banned substances to other countries around the world, including across the global south. The company has a long history of promoting a global agricultural model that creates and perpetuates addiction to its ever more expensive products.” Further the CEO report says, “Recent examples show the capability of the agrochemical giant to challenge or change policies and even laws in countries like Thailand, Mexico, and the US… Bayer’s plans promise a disturbing future for food, farmers, and communities – a future that undermines sustainable agriculture and real climate solutions in order to secure future corporate profits, whatever the environmental and health consequences.” Regarding powerful lobbying efforts , this report tells us, “Major actors in the agrochemical sector, aka ‘Big Toxics’, are currently among the biggest lobby spenders by sector at EU level, jostling for the top place with Big Tech and Big Energy. According to the EU lobby register, Bayer AG spent up between 7 to €8 million in 2023 on EU lobbying, the biggest sum declared by any individual chemical company and the highest amount ever spent by Bayer on EU lobbying. To this we should add an important caveat: these are self-declared figures in a de facto voluntary register. In the past, Monsanto hired lobby firm Fleishman-Hillard to work on its lobby campaign to secure the re-authorisation of glyphosate but did not declare the €14.5 million contract in the register. “It was in the context of this glyphosate lobby campaign that Monsanto-Bayer was exposed by the publication of the Monsanto Papers. In May 2019 Bayer acknowledged that its Monsanto unit was being investigated by French prosecutors for compiling files on journalists, politicians and other influential persons in several European countries. The inquiry was opened after a complaint was filed by newspaper Le Monde, which alleged that Monsanto had developed and maintained a file on 200 European names, including journalists and lawmakers, in hopes of influencing their position on pesticides.” . Source . US investigative journalist Carey Gillam (who has published two books on glyphosate and Monsanto) published an overview of how the company has very actively manipulated the debate on glyphosate. According to Gillam they have done this not only by “ghostwriting scientific papers and suppressing science that conflicts with corporate assertions of Roundup’s safety”, but also via cosy relationships with regulators and lawmakers, and through strategic manipulation and intimidation of the media. The CEO Report states further that in 2022 the US-based investigative group US Right to Know (USRTK) reported that the very active ‘Genetic Literacy Project’ “is an influential front group that partners with Bayer and other chemical companies to promote GMO foods and pesticides and argue for deregulation. Bayer paid the Genetic Literacy Project US$100,000 from July 2020 to June 2021 for its work “to prevent legislative overreach in genetic engineering”, according to the group’s declaration in the US regarding its lobbying there. In its first ‘Political Advocacy Transparency Report’, published in December 2023, Bayer declared spending of €49 million worldwide on lobbying (including the pharmaceutical side of its operations), as well as an extra €26 million on trade association fees. The report indicates that Bayer spent a staggering €75 million on lobbying worldwide in 2022, (of which at least €13.5 million was spent in Europe). Regarding new GMOs, in 2021 Bayer proposed “a new regulation (separate from GMOs) assessing whether the changes in the DNA of the new plant are similar to the ones that could have been obtained through conventional breeding methods or spontaneous mutation.” This would class new GMOs as essentially the same as non-GM. Bayer’s lobbying also ignores the conclusion of scientific researchers in 2022 that we have already exceeded the safe planetary boundaries of chemicals in the environment. Target Seven of the 15th Conference of Parties on the UN Convention for Biodiversity clearly outlines the imperative of “reducing the risks of pesticide use to protect a further decline of biodiversity.” Results of powerful lobbying by Bayer and others in Europe can be seen- the European Commission has proposed to deregulate new GMOs, and has re-authorised the use of the “probably carcinogenic” glyphosate for another decade, despite not having achieved the agreement of a qualified majority of member states. In the USA, “because of the avalanche of litigation unfolding as a result of the toxic nature of glyphosate and the fact that the labels of products that contain glyphosate have not warned users of its potential dangers, Bayer wants to change US law. Bayer has also been lobbying lawmakers in three US states to pass legislation which would provide legal protection for the company from future lawsuits.” As AP reported “nearly identical bills introduced in Iowa, Missouri and Idaho this year – with wording supplied by Bayer – would protect pesticide companies from claims they failed to warn that their product causes cancer.” Experts warn that this could have huge consequences – extending to US product liability laws and providing corporate immunity for lawsuits. The CEO report says, “Despite the adverse health and scientific findings, Bayer isn’t giving up one inch on maintaining its glyphosate production and market. It is simply an extremely profitable chemical, with annual market revenue of US$10 billion in 2023.” This means “ignoring and dismissing the wealth of scientific evidence and the work of the IARC on glyphosate, which has despite enormous pressure not changed its scientific findings.” This is being resisted. In September 2023, 185 US environmental organisations sent letters to the House and Senate, urging both chambers to reject these legislative proposals whose aim is to pre-empt existing state and local laws and ordinances which are in place to safeguard communities from the harmful impacts of toxic agricultural pesticides.The dubious track record of the EPA on glyphosate and other substances has already been widely documented and exposed by the publication of the Monsanto Papers. The CEO report says, “Ever since taking on Monsanto and adding glyphosate-based RoundUp to its list of troublesome products, it has taken many hits. Sales have continued to decline in its crop science and pharma segments, and a further slash in its 2023 revenue directly connected to a drop in glyphosate demand is creating pressure for change.” Bayer had announced that it would take glyphosate for residential use out of the US market in 2023, although its massive agricultural use will be retained. A class action against Bayer was opened by non-Hodgkin Lymphoma patients in Australia – over 800 people allege their cancer was caused by glyphosate and Roundup in particular, spelling more trouble on the horizon. In Missouri, the company was condemned to pay US$1.56 billion for more cancer cases connected to Roundup. The CEO report tells us further that Bayer has been looking into alternatives to glyphosate for some time. “In March 2024 the company announced that such a product would be publicly available in 2028. At the beginning of this year, in Brazil, Bayer presented two new herbicides in this vein: Icafolin and Convintro. The Convintro herbicide contains PFAS diflufenican and endocrine-disrupting metribuzim, two substances which are bound to raise serious environmental and health issues.” The CEO report adds, “An even more business-friendly and Bayer-friendly German government in 2025, such as one led by the former director of BlackRock Germany (one of Bayer’s biggest shareholders) – and current CDU leader in the Bundestag – Friedrich Merz, might improve Bayer’s prospects. With a rise in conservative and far-right elected representatives in the EU, Bayer and its toxic lobby will likely realign for new political scenarios.” Expressing shock the CEO report says, “It is astonishing to see how far Monsanto’s (subsequently Bayer’s) lobbying has sunk its teeth into public decision-making across the world. Bayer’s lobby tactics continue to capture public policy-making, and in doing so hollow out democracy. A perverse symbiosis between corporate lobby groups and decision-makers has been actively created through its economic weight and large investments in many corners of the world, and this consistently leads to crucial decisions being made in favor of industry profits, rather than public interest.” Further, this report adds, “companies like Monsanto/Bayer have for many years managed to influence, design and change national policies on the use of pesticides and biotechnology in food production, leading to significant and long-lasting environmental and health harm. But if Bayer were to now succeed in changing US law on labelling, and thus to de facto achieve immunity from further litigation related to its toxic products, that would still be a new low for democracy and for policies to improve public health and preserve biodiversity.” According to the CEO report, “Some things are really hard to change. As with the three other ‘horsemen of the agrochemical apocalypse’ – Syngenta, Corteva, and BASF – the dire climate situation of food chokepoints internationally offers the opportunity for corporations like Bayer to hold more power over governments and farmers who are subject to significant socio-economic pressures, deploying patented products, crops, and technologies controlled almost exclusively by them. These companies are privatising life and food itself, with patented seeds and the coupled use of pesticides, to maintain and further lock in an agro-industrial model that produces mainly commodities.” This report strongly asserts, “Companies such as Bayer have left a toxic trail all around the world and all through their long history. Bayer’s model of production, and many of its products, have been a past, present, and future threat to people and planet,– Bayer’s modus operandi is not to work in the public interest, but rather to capture public policy to serve its private interests and dividends of its shareholders, all while ignoring the public health and environmental impact of its activities. “In the short term, we need a firewall between decision-makers on the one side, and Bayer and its lobby representatives on the other. Much as we need toxic-free food and a toxic-free environment, we desperately also need toxic-free politics…We need to urgently kick big toxic polluters out of the places where they exercise their poisonous political influence.” * Click the share button below to email/forward this article to your friends and colleagues.

[+] poised to aggressively cut interest rates. However, Fed chair Jerome Powell played down chances of another 0.5% cut in a speech on Monday, saying officials "are not on any preset course." Meanwhile, traders have been told to "expect fireworks" by analysts David Brickell and Chris Mill, who wrote in their newsletter that they see the bitcoin price hitting fresh all-time highs this week, pointing to China's long-awaited announcement of huge stimulus measures designed to reignite its stalled economy. "The steps taken from China this week will unleash a tsunami of liquidity. Alongside the Fed more aggressively cutting and a global easing cycle, we’re pumping in anticipation of that, but against this short term liquidity drain," Mill and Brickell wrote. "They say don’t fight the Fed. Also don’t fight China. Definitely don’t fight the Fed and China together." One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

Title: Culture Wars And Unconstitutional Laws: The Threat To America's Future

Ill-advised and unconstitutional ideological crusades by conservative state legislators are infringing on the rights of American businesses and endangering America's future. Climate change, conceptual illustration. The Climate Crisis is Here… It's no secret that the accelerating impacts of climate change are being felt worldwide. 2024 is likely to be the warmest year in recorded history, and nine of the hottest years on record have all been in the last decade. To take just one example, residents of Phoenix, Arizona experienced 113 days in a row this summer with over 100-degree temperatures. With hotter days come more extreme weather events. In what was billed as a once-in-a-1000-year event, Sarasota, Florida and its environs experienced as much as ten inches of rain in just 24 hours this past June. (This followed once-in-a-millennium rainstorms in St. Louis, Kentucky, Death Valley in 2022, and Fort Lauderdale in 2023.) July saw Hurricane Beryl become the earliest-ever Category 5 hurricane to develop in the Atlantic. Last week, after another once–in–a–thousand–year rainstorm in Western NC, Hurricane Helene devastated the Southeast, bringing catastrophic flooding to Appalachian cities. As climate impacts become increasingly extreme, we are collectively racing against time to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions before we reach 1.5 degrees of warming. The good news is the global renewable energy boom is here. With costs coming down and technology improving, the world will install an estimated 593 gigawatts of solar capacity this year, nearly 30% more than in 2023 and six times more than in 2019. Here in the U.S., led by California and Texas, we now have eight times more solar power and twice as much wind power as a decade ago. Battery storage capacity is also expected to nearly double this year, meaning more renewable energy can be saved and used whenever needed. …But Texas Legislators Would Halt Our Progress Since its oil boom days, Texas has always been an energy leader, and these days are no exception – Texas now leads the country in wind power and is second only to California in solar. The clean energy transition is crucial for the Lone Star state since Texas is especially threatened by warming temperatures and hurricanes. Its statewide energy grid is also increasingly overwhelmed: Texas suffered 210 power outages between 2020 and 2023, more than any other state. So, given the urgent necessity of decarbonizing our energy grid and Texas's role as a renewable energy leader, why have its lawmakers been trying to sabotage progress against climate change? In 2021, Texas conservatives passed S.B. 13, a misguided and arguably unconstitutional law requiring all state entities, like pension funds and the K-12 education endowment, to divest any business that has moved away from supporting fossil fuels. Meant as an ideological attack against the growing move towards Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) investing, S.B. 13, according to a study by the Texas Association of Business, cost Texas nearly $700 million in lost economic activity, $181 million in annual earnings, more than 3000 full-time jobs, and more than $37 million in tax revenues in F.Y. 2022-2023. S.B. 13's ideological crusade also prompted five of the largest underwriters for municipal bonds in Texas – JP Morgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, Bank of America, and Fidelity – to exit the Texas market, meaning much higher borrowing costs for Texas cities. These five banks "used to underwrite about 35% of the debt in the market," notes Wharton Business professor Daniel Garrett, "so they've left a really big gap." The Texas public school fund also pulled $8.5 billion from Blackrock to comply with the law. Last month, supported by Democracy Forward, the American Sustainable Business Council (ASBC) filed a lawsuit against S.B. 13 and a similar law, S.B. 19, which forces state funds to divest from companies that restrict business with gunmakers. "SB-13 is not just a misguided policy," says David Levine, president and co-founder of ASBC. "It is an unconstitutional attack that stifles free speech and punishes businesses for prioritizing responsible investments." In fact, an Oklahoma District Court Judge has already struck down Oklahoma's anti-ESG law for similar reasons. As Chris Tomlinson wrote in the Houston Chronicle of this "unconstitutional, authoritarian power grab that hurts all Texans," "whether you worry about climate change or not, the real issue is whether the government should dictate any company's investment strategy. True conservatives believe elected officials should stay out of private sector decisions." It's Not Just Texas. Unfortunately, Texas lawmakers are not alone in these attempts to hamstring American businesses. Per Reuters, 2022 saw at least 44 new bills or laws in 17 red states that attempted to penalize companies for investment strategies or behaviors they deemed too progressive, up from a dozen in 2021. Among these was Florida Governor Ron DeSantis's infamous "Stop WOKE Act," which attempted to ban workplace trainings on improving race relations and which a federal judge permanently blocked in July. Similarly, the Republican-controlled House in Georgia passed a bill cutting tax breaks for Delta Airlines, the state's largest private employer, after its CEO lambasted new voting restrictions there. (The bill failed to pass the Senate.) Even more frightening, the anti-ESG push has now been taken up by the authors of Project 2025, the Heritage Foundation blueprint to supercharge a second Trump presidency. In their report, they call for Trump's Department of Labor to "remove ESG considerations from ERISA," the law setting minimum standards for pension and health plans. After deriding ESG for taking into account woke causes like "reducing greenhouse gas emissions," the Project 2025 report decrees that "DOL should prohibit investing in ERISA plans on the basis of any factors that are unrelated to investor risks and returns." However, considering the impacts of climate change is precisely the type of long-term risk that businesses and investors should be evaluating to protect their returns and financial health. Of course, the government plays an indispensable role in regulating companies, so they follow the law, do right by their workers and communities, and don't conduct business with America's enemies. But trying to force U.S. companies, by law, to uphold far-right conservative ideology is simply a bridge too far. It is, in a word, unconstitutional. And amidst a global climate crisis that threatens all Americans, especially those most vulnerable in our society, these misguided ideological crusades don't just jeopardize our future prosperity and global competitiveness—they endanger our communities, economy, and planet.

Title: Harris’s economic plan helps, but doesn’t get to the root of middle-class discontent

Time Published: 2024-10-01T09:08:13Z

Hans Taparia is a clinical professor at New York University Stern School of Business. Bruce Buchanan is the C.W. Nichols Professor of Business Ethics and professor of marketing at New York University Stern School of Business. Like any candidate seeking reelection, President Joe Biden ran on his economic record: millions of new jobs created, steady GDP growth, inflation tamed, and new legislation allocating trillions of dollars for climate technology, semiconductors, and infrastructure. Kamala Harris aims to build on this record with child tax credits, down payment assistance for first-time home buyers, tax breaks for small businesses, modest tax increases for the wealthy, and a federal ban on price gouging for groceries. Her plan certainly helps—but none of these policy proposals address the root cause of discontent among the middle class: Wealth creation in America today defies gravity and always flows to the top. Despite recent economic indicators, the quality of life for much of America has been diminishing for decades. Since 1970, the share of income held by the middle class has dropped by a third while the share of income held by the wealthy has nearly doubled. Over the same span, the minimum wage, unchanged since 2007, has lost roughly half its purchasing power. Over 39 million workers, or 23% of the working population, make less than $17 per hour. Over 50% of American households earn less than $75,000, which, based on one study, is what the average family of three in the U.S. needs to earn to cover the costs of its basic needs. Simply put, America is hurting. At the core of the problem is that over the past half-century, American society has been reorganized, both legally and culturally, to put the interests of investors above all others—a state of affairs we call “the investor monoculture.” Today, about 80% of public company stock is owned by institutional investors—the likes of Berkshire Hathaway, BlackRock, State Street, Fidelity, JPMorgan Chase, KKR, and Blackstone. In 1980, this number was just 29%. Such investors tend to operate with one objective: to seek maximum profits, regardless of the harm it may cause society. Such harm usually comes at the expense of workers, customers, and communities—and explains much of the malaise and inchoate rage that plagues America. Today’s extreme profits are being generated in two ways. The first is through cost cutting, which usually means eliminating workers, outsourcing jobs, and lowering wages. Going forward, technological advancement and the artificial intelligence revolution promise to make this worse. The second is a relentless drive for revenue growth, regardless of its effects on society or the planet. For instance, food companies have been supersizing and ultra-processing their products for decades, making a poor diet the leading cause of mortality. Suicide rates for young people are up more than 60% since 2007, but investor pressure pushes technology companies to keep users hooked to their screens for as long as possible. But none of this is the investor’s concern. The investor monoculture serves the richest 10% of households, who hold over 90% of corporate stock, and whose incomes exceed $250,000. It has been the dominant political influence in the legislative and executive branches of the U.S. government since the Reagan administration—lowering taxes on corporations and the wealthy, diminishing the social safety net, frustrating the efforts of organized labor, and pushing back on market regulation. And in recent years, it has put hundreds of pro-investor judges on the federal bench, and a supermajority of six conservative justices on the Supreme Court. The Biden-Harris administration’s attempts to correct this situation have been sincere, but don’t get to the root of the problem. The Biden CHIPS and Science Act provides tens of billions in funding and incentives for American semiconductor manufacturers. But chip manufacturers aren’t large employers, and the biggest beneficiary of these funds will be, yes, the investors in those corporations. Harris just announced a plan for $100 billion in tax credits for companies in strategic industries such as biotechnology, aerospace, blockchain, and artificial intelligence. Once again, it will be the venture capitalists and other large investors in these companies who reap most of the benefits. To materially change our country’s trajectory, a new paradigm is required. Corporations must be redesigned such that everyday people (the bottom 90%) have a more equitable stake and say in corporations. In other words, we need to shift the ownership and governance of corporations away from current investors and toward stakeholders such as employees, customers, suppliers, communities, and the planet. Here’s a set of ideas that can be implemented without any new legislation or funding. This year, the U.S. government will spend $6.5 trillion, or 23% of GDP. Much of this is transfer payments, but trillions of dollars are general expenditures. This represents formidable spending power that can be leveraged to compel corporations to share government-generated wealth more fairly with communities and stakeholders. What if the corporations receiving government funds through the CHIPS and Science Act were required to share ownership rights or profits with the communities in which they build factories? What if the government gave preference to employee-owned businesses, or stipulated profit sharing with stakeholders, for its purchases of goods and services? What if it mandated that, instead of being owned by private equity players looking to return multiples on their investments, all hospice services receiving Medicare funds be substantively owned by nonprofits or the people providing the hospice care? What would that do for the caregivers? What would it do for the care? Or imagine the pride and dedication of construction workers who share in the ownership and profits of firms building government projects. Each year, the U.S. government lends hundreds of billions of dollars to corporations through agencies such as the Small Business Administration, the USDA, and the Department of Energy. Under the Inflation Reduction Act, the Department of Energy alone will lend over $400 billion to climate technology companies. The biggest gains from these loans will go to just a few investors. The U.S. government should stipulate higher levels of ownership, profit sharing, voting, and board rights for workers, communities, or other stakeholders in companies that participate in these programs. Such requirements would spread the benefits of these loans more broadly and give stakeholders a greater sense of economic agency and civic participation. Similarly, when state-funded universities or the National Institutes of Health license new drug discoveries or technology to corporations, they should require profit distribution that flows not just to investors but also to other stakeholders such as patients and caregivers. Imagine if patients shared in the profits from sky-high drug prices. Redesigning corporations to benefit stakeholders and communities using existing market-based approaches presents endless possibilities. The force of government spending and investment applied in this way would foster hope among the 90% who are marginalized by the investor monoculture and begin a process of political healing. America is hurting. Democrats must acknowledge and address this pain. The investor monoculture is at the root of the problem—and government-encouraged corporate redesign is one viable path to recovery. We already have the tools to do this. The question is whether we have the political will.

Share this article Circle has announced plans to bring its USDC stablecoin to Australia through a partnership with venture capitalist Mark Carnegie’s MHC Digital Group, signaling an expansion into the Asia Pacific region. The collaboration aims to increase USDC distribution and explore institutional use cases in Australia and beyond. MHC Digital Group, with offices in Australia and Singapore, will provide USDC access to wholesale clients across Australia. Circle’s Chief Business Officer Kash Razzaghi highlighted the region’s potential, noting its young, mobile-first population and digital wallet readiness. The partnership could help Australian superannuation funds avoid bank fees and may lead to the creation of an Australian dollar stablecoin in the future. This expansion follows Circle’s recent moves, including relocating its headquarters to New York City’s One World Trade Center ahead of a planned IPO valued at around $5 billion. The company has also made USDC available to investors in Mexico and Brazil through the banking system and became the first global stablecoin issuer licensed to offer dollar- and euro-pegged tokens in the European Union. USDC, the second-largest stablecoin behind Tether’s USDT, currently has a market cap of $35 billion and a 24-hour trading volume of $7.87 billion. The partnership with MHC Digital Group represents another step in Circle’s global expansion strategy, potentially bringing stablecoin technology to a broader audience in the Asia Pacific region. In September, Circle partnered with Sony Block Solutions Labs to integrate USDC on Sony’s Ethereum layer-2 blockchain, Soneium, aiming to transform digital finance and entertainment transactions. Earlier this year, Circle implemented smart contract support for BlackRock BUIDL holders, enabling them to transfer shares for USDC, streamlining blockchain transactions and reducing costs. Beyond native L2s, Circle has also expanded its Web3 services to the Solana blockchain, enhancing USDC accessibility for developers and enterprises with improved on-chain transaction management and secure wallet integration.

75% of employers worldwide are struggling to find the talent they need. In Agreus Group's article 2024 predictions for the family office space, I touched upon a significant ongoing global challenge: a widespread shortage of skilled professionals. The 2023 ManpowerGroup Talent Shortage Study indicates that 75% of employers worldwide are struggling to find the talent they need. This difficulty spans several sectors, with accounting, financial services and investment roles facing some of the most pronounced shortages. Family offices must strategically contend with large corporations for this sought-after talent. Understanding the Global Talent Shortage The global job market today offers skilled professionals a plethora of career choices, presenting a challenge for those seeking to recruit the best. There is a particularly acute shortage of finance and accounting expertise. Avalara’s research reveals that 84% of Chief Financial Officers (CFOs) surveyed in the United States (U.S.) and the United Kingdom (U.K.) face a significant talent shortage within their teams. Family offices often require high-calibre talent in specialised areas such as accounting, financial services and investment, where specific expertise is essential for managing complex portfolios for Ultra-high-net-worth (UHNW) families. According to the 2023 BlackRock Global Family Office Survey, 40% of family offices see talent sourcing as a major hurdle in achieving their investment goals. Identifying and retaining top talent has become a major challenge for family offices worldwide. Strategies to Address the Talent Gap With intense competition in attracting top professionals, family offices must differentiate themselves. We recommend a well-rounded strategy to effectively tackle this talent shortage: Competitive Compensation Packages As an expert in the family office recruitment space, we know compensation plays a huge part in attracting and retaining talent. Professionals are often drawn to family offices from sectors where competitive compensation is standard. To engage and keep such talent, it is crucial to offer compensation that is on par with the industry standard, ensuring they match what these individuals may have received from their prior roles. Our 2023 Global Family Office Compensation Benchmark Report is an invaluable resource for benchmarking against other family offices and staying competitive in the market. Explore the Global Talent Pool Expanding your hiring criteria can be an effective strategy to tackle the talent shortage. One way to do this is by leveraging global recruitment and considering job seekers from other countries. With increased global mobility, family offices can have a more varied skill set from an extended talent pool. This will ultimately increase your chances of finding highly qualified candidates and filling vacancies successfully. Flexible Work Arrangements Embracing flexible work arrangements, such as remote work and flexible hours, can broaden the pool of potential candidates and improve employee satisfaction. Remote work also allows you to extend your reach beyond borders, which can help you overcome local skill gaps and save money in the process. Professional Development Opportunities Investing in employee development helps to build a positive work environment, enhances retention, and keeps your family office in the know with the latest developments. It is also a proactive approach to tackling the global talent shortage. The global talent shortage is undoubtedly a critical challenge for family offices worldwide. Family offices must implement a comprehensive strategy to effectively compete for top-tier professionals in the fierce market. By prioritising the strategies discussed above, family offices can attract and retain the skilled talent necessary to achieve their long-term goals.

Title: Open source is not a trust issue, it’s an innovation issue
URL: https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366612512/Open-source-is-not-a-trust-issue-its-an-innovation-issue

Dmitry Nikolaev - stock.adobe.co No project is smooth sailing all the way. So perhaps it was appropriate that the Open Source Summit Europe kicked off amid some of the worst storms in memory, before finishing in clear blue skies and warm autumnal sunshine. The Linux Foundation-backed conference saw a raft of product announcements and initiatives, among which was the rolling together of distributed trust projects – including blockchain, ledger, identity and cryptographic efforts – into an LF Foundation Decentralised Trust. The Linux Foundation announced general availability of Valkey 8.0, the open source in-memory database project forked from Redis earlier this year, after the eponymous company behind the in-memory database changed its licence. Meanwhile, Amazon Web Services (AWS) donated the OpenSearch project to the Linux Foundation. The cloud giant launched the OpenSearch project in response to Elastic’s licence switch on ElasticSearch back in 2021. At the same time, the Linux Foundation and its mighty offshoot the Cloud Native Computing Foundation have partnered with Unified Patents to “defend open source software from non-practising entities”, by which they mean patent trolls. But while the “ecosystem” looks in rude health, what is happening in the community? Or more to the point, how are businesses really using and benefiting from open source software? The Linux Foundation’s Open source maturity in Europe report paints a robust picture, stating that between 2022 and 2024, “more than half of the respondents each year reported seeing an increased business value from using OSS compared to the previous year”. For this year, it revealed that just under two-thirds reported a rise in business value from the year before. “This indicates a compounding effect, where the value derived from open source software grows each year. Similarly, the benefits from contributions are also on the rise, with 52% of respondents in recent surveys reporting increased benefits compared to prior years,” said the report. Those benefits include increased productivity, cited by 62%, catalysed innovation (61%) and reduced operating costs (60%). Critically, over three-quarters believed open source software to be more secure than closed source software. But the research also found that resistant organisational cultures were a brake on open source adoption, particularly “in sectors traditionally resistant to openness, such as finance”. It added: “Open source is often mistakenly viewed as merely a technical matter, when in fact, it is a cultural change – it is a change maker and needs to be approached in a multidimensional strategy.” Achieving that cultural change can be critical when it comes to dealing with an increasingly volatile world, where organisations need to constantly innovate just to survive. In a panel on lessons from vertical industries, Mercedes-Benz open source programme lead Wolfgang Gehring said a modern vehicle was a datacentre on wheels, so “innovation and software [mean] open source”, and when it comes to common problems, “you can collaborate with other companies in the industry in open source”. Before open source, he added, “that was much more difficult”. On the same panel, Karel Rietveld, Open Source Program Office lead at the Dutch Tax and Customs Administration, said motivations and inhibitions could be slightly different in the public sector, with different regulations and layers of management and compliance to be aware of. Open source might be more cost effective, a big issue for cash-strapped public entities, he added, but there was also the cost of publicly funded time and people to consider. But, of course, these are the already converted, and it might be argued that many critical sectors will continue to have an instinctive distrust of open source and be extremely unwilling to embed it in their systems. A glib response might be that few companies are not taking advantage of open source in some form anyway. That might be the CEO’s Android phone. Or it could be their use of cloud technologies or services which rely on a cloud native stack predicated on containers and Kubernetes, and open source security tools, and open source-powered developer workflows. For all the talk about community, sometimes it’s more base common interest that will drive a company or a sector to use open source. Finance is generally secretive, but increasingly is adopting open source. That’s not necessarily for any utopian ideals. Rather, banks and other financial institutions will have common problems to code for, in the shape of compliance with regulations for example, so it makes sense from an efficiency point of view to find common answers to these problems. Gabriele Columbro, who heads up both the Linux Foundation Europe and the Fintech Open Source Foundation (FINOS), said if anything, financial services are ahead of “other traditional industries in their adoption and strategic understanding of open source”. The sector is already highly tech-centric, he said, with banks potentially employing tens of thousands of developers. “And not only the big banks – we have the buy sides, Blackrock, Fidelity, five or six buy side members, and everyone in between. The clearing houses started coming in … so the whole ecosystem is starting to harmonise around open standards and open source.” The power sector is another “conservative” industry that is increasingly relying on open source as it races to rebuild its systems and infrastructure to meet the climate change challenge. This requires new ways of managing and predicting demand, and that means new tools – fast. As with finance, all operators face these problems, making cooperation easier to contemplate. Jonas van den Bogaard, open source lead at Dutch power distribution company Alliander, and a member of the technical advisory council at LF Energy, said the power distribution sector in Holland – likes its counterparts worldwide – is racing to decarbonise the grid and underpin electrification. As well as building out physical capacity, this will require much better tools for management and forecasting. “We are actively searching for collaboration and partnerships with industry players – with vendors, both academia and also cross-sector – to bundle resources, knowledge and expertise to realise these new digital integrations,” he said. “We’ve seen open source more as one of the means to make this possible, and it has been very successful for building up several capabilities.” And power is not the only critical infrastructure that will be relying on open source. Timo Perala heads up Nokia’s open source projects office, having previously worked in standards. Ultimately, he said, its customers want products and services that work – they are not necessarily concerned whether they include open source elements, just as they wouldn’t necessarily care where Nokia sourced components like buts and bolts. Moreover, open source collaboration is a form of shared research and development, where everyone needs to solve a problem without necessarily capitalising on the solution. Perala likened it to how companies agree on a handover on a mobile network. “That is something that you just can’t charge for ... it’s a basic requirement, not a competitive advantage,” he said. It’s hard to think of more conservative industries than power, finance and telecoms. But they are also industries that are facing high levels of disruption and a corresponding need to innovate quickly. If they’re building their businesses on open source, the only reason the rest of the world hasn’t is because they’re not being confronted with the same level of potential disruption. Yet. As Mercedes’ Gehring told his audience: “Innovation nowadays happens in open source. Innovation in software happens in open source. And you’re either there and you participate, or you’re not. That’s basically it.”

Title: Gerry Thornley: Corinthians find their path by putting faith in youth

All has changed, changed utterly in grassroots rugby. Few games on the opening day of the Energia All-Ireland League season last Saturday week illustrated this more than newly-promoted Corinthians’ trip to Ballymena. They come from different provinces and for much of the AIL’s 34-year history from different worlds. Ballymena’s list of grandees includes Willie John McBride, Syd Millar and Trevor Ringland, among others. They were one of the initial nine clubs in the inaugural Division 1 when the AIL was formed in 1990-91. Save for a two-year stay in Division 2, Ballymena remained a top-tier club until 2009 and were champions in 2003 when beating Clontarf in the final. They have oscillated between the second and third tiers ever since. Corinthians have had their notable past players too, including Noel Mannion and Johnny O’Connor, and technically Mack Hansen is among their number too and has illuminated Corinthians Park with his off-field presence this season. However, the Galway club began AIL life in Division 2 and lasted only one season before being relegated back to the Connacht Senior League. They rejoined an expanded AIL in Division 3 in 1993-94 but were relegated to Division 4 the following season. The two clubs remained three and two divisions apart for 14 seasons before meeting for the first time in April 2011 in 1B (the second tier) when Corinthians beat Ballymena 29-27, although that didn’t stop the latter being promoted. Like ships passing in the night, Corinthians moved a division above Ballymena in 2013-14 in 1B for one year only and the following season they rubbed shoulders a second time. Promoted Ballymena won 20-0 at Eaton Park in September 2014 and the sides drew in Corinthian Park the following December as Corinthians were relegated. And that was it until last Saturday week, on foot of Corinthians winning promotion from 2B last season via the play-offs. But the novelty value of the fixture didn’t stop there. The average age of the Corinthians match-day squad was 19 years and 11 months, yet they returned from Eaton Park with a 27-10 bonus-point win. Last Saturday, an even younger Corinthians hosted Greystones, whose alumni include the late, great Paul McNaughton, as well as Tony Ward, Nick Popplewell and more. Although Greystones soon became a Division 1 club after also starting life with Corinthians in Division 2 the two are familiar foes. Greystones won 2B a couple of seasons ago, with Corinthians second. After a small lunch hosted by club president Roy Gibson in McHugh’s across the road, on a lovely sunny afternoon near Claregalway, props Billy Bohan, Fiachna Barrett, eye-catching 19-year-old flanker Max Flynn, classy outhalf Sean Naughton and left-winger James Nicholson (himself a Greystones lad) were all released from the Connacht academy and recalled. Including centre John Devine, younger brother of scrumhalf Matthew, this quintet are also current or recent Irish under-20s, while replacement scrumhalf Tomás Farthing is another in the Connacht academy. Conceivably one of the university clubs has fielded younger sides, but Corinthians’ youthful spirit is extraordinary for a club with no university affiliations. Perhaps it’s the mature head on him, his leadership qualities seeing him become club captain in just his second season, but Mark Boyle stands out as the old man of the team. And he’s only 23. The number eight was released by the Leinster academy and, after also being rejected by Connacht, he contemplated retiring as so many of his age do if denied a path into the professional game. But, living in Galway and working for Aviva, he is loving life and rugby more than ever. His older brother Paul was a replacement in Connacht’s 36-30 comeback win over the Sharks later that night, which made for a long day in Galway for their fortunate Dublin-based dad “Pablo”. Boyle hails the attention to detail of head coach Michael Harding as well as forwards coach Pat Cunningham and backs coach JJ Hanrahan. Harding will have a detailed breakdown of every player’s performance on their phones by 8pm on match night. Hanrahan, availing of his ACL injury to make his first foray into coaching, describes working with such talented young backs as “a dream”, while they must feel likewise given his knowledge. As the watching ex-Corinthians and Connacht outhalf Ciaran Smyth puts it, making hay, and scoring tries, while the sun shines before the wet days of winter is imperative for this young side. After a break from their own 22 by their Welsh centre Tom Waters (20), Barrett finished strongly inside four minutes. Naughton also converted their second try by 19-year-old lock Bryan Walsh, who has previously been donated size 16 boots by Connacht’s Pro12-winning lock Ally Muldownwey. As well as a howitzer of a boot, Naughton is creator-in-chief, with his ability to take the ball to the line, passing range off both hands and cross kicks. Corinthians sealed a bonus point by half-time through Sean Fox and Flynn. After a rally by Greystones and a try by centre Andrew Lynch, Corinthians finished strongly, with Naughton (20) and Fox (19) combining for full-back Orin Burke (19) to score before Charlie Leonard is driven over. Corinthians’ 40-10 win leaves them in a four-way tie atop 2A alongside Barnhall, Instonians and Cashel. Early days, and they won’t always have their academy stardust. But what makes their success just as impressive is that last weekend they also fielded two under-20 sides. This is at a time when under-20 sides in Irish clubs are in alarming decline. Their under-20s “firsts” beat their Blackrock counterparts 27-17 away on Sunday to seal promotion to the Leinster first division with two long-range tries by Walsh’s younger brother Sean, another Irish under-20 international, while their seconds beat Galwegians in the Connacht under-20 final. The driving force for this depth at under-20 level is largely attributed to the work of club stalwart John “Stack” Noone. Founded in 1932, Corinthians appear to have found their niche. gerry.thornley@irishtimes.com Sign up to the Irish Times weekly rugby digest for the view from the press box with Gerry Thornley © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Title: BlackRock sees potential in spot Ethereum ETF, despite slower uptake compared to Bitcoin

Share this article BlackRock’s spot Ethereum ETF, also known as ETHA, has seen slower growth than its Bitcoin counterpart but Robert Mitchnick, the company’s head of digital assets, remains optimistic about its long-term prospects, especially considering its rapid accumulation of assets under management (AUM). “It’s very rare that you see an ETF get to a billion AUM in seven weeks, as ETHA did,” said Mitchnick, speaking at the Messari Mainnet conference in New York this week. “In most cases, it takes multiple years to never for a new ETF to get to a billion.” Launched in July following the SEC’s surprising approval, it took ETHA less than a month to reach $1 billion in net inflows. As of September 30, ETHA’s Ethereum holdings exceeded 380,601 ETH, valued at around $1 billion. Source: ishares.com Despite lagging behind BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF (IBIT), which amassed $2 billion in AUM within just 15 days of its launch, ETHA is still among the world’s top performing crypto ETFs. The stagnant performance is not entirely unexpected for BlackRock and other ETF experts. Mitchnick believes that the investment story and narrative for Ethereum are “less easy” for investors to “digest.” “So that’s a big part of why we’re so committed to the education journey that we’re on with a lot of our clients,” he explained. BlackRock’s head of digital assets said that he did not expect ETHA to ever reach the same level of flows and AUM as IBIT, but saw the current performance as a “good start.” Speaking at the Bitcoin 2024 convention in Nashville in July, Mitchnick said the company’s client base is primarily interested in Bitcoin, followed by Ethereum. There is “very little” demand for crypto ETFs beyond the two leading crypto assets, he noted. For BlackRock, Bitcoin and Ethereum offer complementary benefits, rather than competing for the same role. Mitchnick predicted that investors would allocate 20% of their crypto holdings to Ethereum and the remaining 80% to Bitcoin. Share this article Sign in to your account Don’t have an account?

Title: Powering Data Centers Is A Herculean Task
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/09/30/powering-data-centers-is-a-herculean-task/

There are numerous ways to invest in the Artificial Intelligence (AI) boom. Some high flying chip stocks like Nvidia have captured the spotlight, but there are more ways to invest in a broad wave of AI adoption than just semiconductor chips. Chips are essential, but without the infrastructure to support them they’re useless. Investors should also consider the sector powering the data centers needed for AI development. According to the Electric Power Research Institute, data centers are forecasted to consume up to 9% of US electricity generation per year by 2030, up from 4% in 2023. That doesn’t sound like much, but between replacing old power generation and turning on new power arrays, the step up is significant. The reason is AI. The energy needs for AI computing are immense. To put the energy consumption into perspective, AI queries – just asking ChatGPT to clean up that email to your boss – can require approximately ten times the electricity of traditional internet searches. Training new models and running more complicated queries suck even more power. The need for more power generation is so intense that it’s actually becoming the primary obstacle for companies looking to innovate in AI. The ideas are there, the computational chips are expensive, but they’re there, but you need to figure out how to meet the energy needs for the data center to function. As this space continues to play out, we think it’s worth exploring opportunities within energy generation where investors can benefit from partnerships between both the upstream and downstream players in the AI market. This picture taken on January 23, 2023 in Toulouse, southwestern France, shows screens displaying ... [+] the logos of OpenAI and ChatGPT. ChatGPT is a conversational artificial intelligence software application developed by OpenAI. (Photo by Lionel BONAVENTURE / AFP) (Photo by LIONEL BONAVENTURE/AFP via Getty Images) To explore the first-phase beneficiaries providing key inputs for AI advancements, it’s worth breaking down what data centers are used for when it comes to artificial intelligence. Data centers are the backbone of this AI boom as they store the hardware necessary to train AI models. As modern technology companies have grown larger and larger, and the amount of equipment needed to maintain operations and cloud services has skyrocketed, the energy demand from hyperscalers has followed suit. Hyperscalers – companies that operate cloud computing infrastructure – provide the storage and compute power necessary to train AI and are faced with the difficult task of deciding where to source the energy needed for their daily operations. Major players within this space include Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud, all of which are forming partnerships with local utilities and power providers to ensure their energy demand is met. With the sweeping transition to cloud data storage, electricity demand has turned into the biggest problem facing the industry. Hyperscalers providing infrastructure and platform services just can’t get enough of it, and the world of institutional finance is taking advantage of the opportunity. As we’ve seen recently, Blackrock teamed up with Microsoft (MSFT) and MGX (an AI fund out of The United Arab Emirates) to announce the launch of a $30 billion AI infrastructure investment fund focusing on building out data centers and energy infrastructure. While this may seem like a massive investment initially, it pales in comparison to the total investment in AI from the top 5 hyperscalers over the next few years. For context, current projections indicate the investment levels will reach a combined $1 trillion in 2027 according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. The way power is generated and sold to large hyperscale consumers is going to change. Whereas in the past many data centers may have tapped into local electrical grids, the future of data center electrification involves dedicated power construction and long term power purchase agreements (PPAs). Hyperscalers prefer PPAs over market spot pricing since they’re able to guarantee stable energy prices for an extended period, typically over ten years. This level of certainty provides a hedge against unwanted price fluctuations that would affect hyperscalers’ bottom line and put upward pressure on already substantial model training costs. Perhaps more important though is the desirability of long term contracts for developers and investors. PPAs from cash flush hyperscalers give developers the ability to secure financing for rapid construction of new power generation facilities. Knowing you have a reliable counter party allows for better profit forecasting! Furthermore, many of the power generation projects are dedicated solely to the data center and disconnected from the broader grid – a contract stipulating a minimum rate of return is essential for a project that takes years to break even and only has a single customer. Finally, it’s worth pointing out that while renewables like wind and solar are the preferred long term source of power for the data centers, the demand right now is high enough that other options are on the table too. Nuclear power is back in the spotlight and natural gas turbines offer rapid deployment. Each power source comes with pros and cons – some are more flexible and some are harder to ramp up and down with data center demand. There will be a wide variety of solutions to the power conundrum over the next several years and many solutions that start off as off grid or dedicated power supplies may eventually end up becoming part of the larger power system. NENTMANNSDORF, SAXONIA, GERMANY - 2012/09/04: Photovoltaik solar panels in a row at sunrise.. (Photo ... [+] by Frank Bienewald/LightRocket via Getty Images) The long term demand for electricity is an opportunity to accelerate the build out of clean energy solutions. The top hyperscalers have set ambitious goals to reduce their carbon footprints – renewable power is a must for them over longer time frames. Among the top names, Google is targeting to operate its data centers on carbon-free energy by 2030, and Microsoft and Amazon both hope to shift to 100% renewable energy by 2025. The massive undertaking is already underway as Microsoft (MSFT) and Brookfield Renewable Partners (BEP) signed the biggest-ever clean power deal this year for their data centers in the US and Europe, effectively penciling in 10.5 gigawatts of renewable energy capacity starting in 2026 and estimated to cost more than $10 billion. Keep in mind that 10.5 gigawatts is 3 times larger than the amount of electricity consumed by all data centers in Northern Virginia – commonly know as the data center capital of the world due to its favorable state tax incentives and best in-class access to power and internet connectivity. With the steadfast increase in renewable energy demand due to corporate mandates, there are several ways to invest. We’ve already touched on the financing side where groups like Blackrock or Brookfield are raising capital to fund the construction of new power projects. Then there’s the manufacturing side, companies that make solar panels or electrical components, or companies who build wind turbines like GE Vernova (GEV). Finally, there are the utilities who want to own and operate the power generation facitlities over the next several decades, companies like NextEra Energy (NEE) or Constellation Energy Corp. (CEG). Finally there are cutting edge innovations in the power space that are less proven. As an example, innovative nuclear technology, like small modular reactors, is progressing rapidly and has received extensive backing from the US Department of Energy. These new reactors, built by firms such as NuScale Power (SMR), are smaller than traditional reactors and don’t have to be custom-built on-site. The process of generating electricity through nuclear fission is the same, but the benefits include reduced construction time, enhanced passive safety features, greater flexibility in deployment, and more efficient fuel usage. For broad adoption with data centers in the US, we’ll need to see continued investment in generation capacity and regulatory compliance, so patience is key. CHANGJIANG, CHINA - AUGUST 10: Aerial view of the core module of China's Linglong One, the world's ... [+] first commercial small modular reactor (SMR), installed on August 10, 2023 in Changjiang Li Autonomous County, Hainan Province of China. Linglong One, which is self-developed by the China National Nuclear Corporation, was installed successfully in Hainan on August 10. (Photo by Luo Yunfei/China News Service/VCG via Getty Images) The rapid expansion of artificial intelligence and pursuing energy demand are creating significant opportunities in the energy sector. As hyperscalers like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft ramp up their AI infrastructure, the need for massive amounts of electricity will drive investments in both traditional and renewable energy sources. While fossil fuels may provide immediate solutions due to existing infrastructure, the long-term focus is shifting toward renewables, such as wind, solar, and even nuclear power to meet sustainability goals. Well-established and innovative companies in the energy sector, especially those forming strategic partnerships with hyperscalers can offer an alternative method to invest in the AI market besides buying chip companies or hyperscalers directly, even if the full societal benefits of investment end up taking years to play out. The ongoing collaboration between energy and AI firms will be crucial for supporting AI adoption and addressing challenges that lie ahead. Regardless of any short-term uncertainties, the unrelenting demand for energy remains far from being satisfied, and investors should continue to monitor the space for opportunities. One Community.

Title: BlackRock exec says new Ethereum ETF faces ‘narrative’ challenge
URL: https://fortune.com/crypto/2024/09/30/blackrock-exec-says-new-ethereum-etf-faces-narrative-challenge/
Time Published: 2024-10-01T00:13:49Z
Full Content:
The volume and inflows for BlackRock’s recently-launched Ethereum ETF are vastly lower than their Bitcoin counterparts—and the company’s head of digital assets, Robert Mitchnick, doesn’t expect that to change anytime soon. Speaking at the Messari Mainnet conference in New York, Mitchnick conceded that the performance of BlackRock’s exchange-traded fund for Ethereum—known as ETHA—has so far been “underwhelming” compared to its Bitcoin ETF. But he urged the audience to compare ETHA against ETFs overall: “It’s very rare that you see an ETF get to a billion AUM in seven weeks, as ETHA did. In most cases, it takes multiple years to never for a new ETF to get to a billion.” The world’s largest asset manager launched their Bitcoin ETF in January to wild success, as IBIT reached $2 billion in assets under management within 15 days. ETHA’s debut in July was much less lucrative, accumulating about $1 billion within a month. Today, IBIT sits at $24 billion in assets under management, while ETHA remains at around $1 billion. “With ETH, I think the investment story and narrative is a bit less easy for a lot of investors to digest, so that’s a big part of why we’re so committed to the education journey that we’re on with a lot of our clients,” Mitchnick said. “And so, you don’t expect them to ever be quite as large in terms of flows and AUM as their Bitcoin counterparts are. But it’s still a pretty good start.” BlackRock is one of the largest asset managers to embrace crypto as an integral part of its business strategy, but it’s not the only one. BlackRock began trading spot Bitcoin ETFs in January, alongside ten others approved by the SEC at once, an unprecedented and transformative decision making cryptocurrency accessible to mainstream investors. Since then, spot Bitcoin ETFs have acquired $61 billion in cumulative total new assets, according to SoSoValue data. Recently, spot Bitcoin ETFs had a monster run, pulling in $365 million in a single day. BlackRock, Fidelity and ARK Invest consistently lead the charge in spot Bitcoin ETFs. More recently, the SEC approved nine spot Ether ETFs. BlackRock, Fidelity, Bitwise and Invesco are among companies that have launched Ether ETFs. Since their launch, these ETFs have collectively grabbed about $7 billion. During the course of his Mainnet interview, Mitchnick also discussed the upcoming election, decentralized finance and tokenization. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Title: ‘National Security’ Officials Who Endorsed Harris Tied To Intel Agencies, Defense Contractors
URL: https://dailycaller.com/2024/09/30/national-security-officials-deep-state-kamala-harris-endorse/
Time Published: 2024-09-30T22:20:56Z
Full Content:
Over 700 members of National Security Leaders for America (NSL4A) signed a letter endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris last week, but many of the officials are aligned with defense contractors and organizations pushing for U.S. involvement in foreign conflict. Some of the officials voted for the U.S. invasion of Iraq – including former Secretaries of State John Kerry and Hillary Clinton – which amounted to a nearly $140 billion boon to private contractors, according to CNN. In addition to bureaucrats and veterans of the intelligence community, the list features numerous individuals affiliated with defense contractors, government-funded think tanks, and organizations partnered with arms manufacturers. The letter asserts Harris will defend democracy while former President Donald Trump will enable authoritarianism, touting her support for Ukraine. Harris recently toured a munitions factory in Pennsylvania with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The letter does not mention that Russia invaded Ukraine during the Biden-Harris administration. (RELATED: “Many People Died, And What For?”: Ukrainians Increasingly Willing To Make Peace With Russia As War Rages On) “America’s national security requires a serious and capable Commander-in-Chief. That is why 741 National Security Leaders proudly endorse @KamalaHarris for President of the United States.” #nationalsecurity #Election2024 #HarrisWalz2024 #DefeatTrumphttps://t.co/ySwJYA29ZI pic.twitter.com/DiMUn0xqMF — National Security Leaders for America (@NSLforAmerica) September 22, 2024 The NSL4A list includes officials that are formerly or presently involved with the arms industry. For example, former Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson serves on the board of directors of Lockheed Martin, according to the company’s site. NSL4A member Rear Admiral John D. Butler spent a decade at Lockheed Martin, including as Vice President for Naval Strategic Systems, according to his bio at University of Texas at Austin. Former Acting Secretary of the Navy, Buddie J. Penn, worked for Loral Federal Systems, which was acquired by Lockheed Martin in the late nineties, the Naval Historical Foundation states in his biography.

Former CIA director and Deputy Secretary of Defense, John Deutch, served as director of Raytheon, according to the EFI Foundation. Former National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Director, Letitia A. Long, was elected to Raytheon’s Board of Directors in 2015, according to PR Newswire (although she is not presently listed on Raytheon’s site). Brett B. Lambert, former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense, served as Vice President of Corporate Strategy for the defense contractor from 2015-2019, according to Stimson. (RELATED: Biden Pentagon Rolls Out $1.7 Billion Arms Package To Ukraine) If the endorsers are not directly tied to the arms industry, some are involved in organizations supported by major defense contractors — notably, think tanks that influence U.S. national security and foreign policy. Over 50 of those who signed the letter are members of the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), which publishes Foreign Affairs and is a heavyweight in the D.C. influence industry. CFR is partnered with various companies, from Blackrock to defense contractors. Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman are listed as Bronze level members of the Council. A Bronze corporate membership is at least $50,000, according to CFR. Members include former Secretary of Homeland Security and Democratic Arizona Governor Janet Napolitano, as well as former Under Secretary-General of the United Nations, Catherine Bertini. The next president will face serious foreign policy challenges.

NSL4A member and former Ambassador Stuart Eizenstat is listed as a lifetime director for the Council, according to its website. In 2022, Lockheed Martin Corporation and General Atomics both contributed at least $250,000, according to its 2022-2023 annual report. The Council also received over $1 million in contributions each from the Department of Defense (DoD) and Department of State in 2022. Notably, the Atlantic Council’s Scowcroft Center “directly shaped key US and allied strategy documents, including through private meetings with senior officials on the National Security Strategy, National Defense Strategy, and NATO’s Strategic Concept,” according to its report. Multiple members of NSL4A – including John Kerry – are also affiliated with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. That group received funding from The Boeing Company, according to its 2023 annual report. Additionally, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Open Society Foundations – the latter founded by left-wing billionaire George Soros – contributed to the organization. (RELATED: Trump Pledges To ‘Bring Peace To The World’ After ‘Very Good’ Phone Call With Zelensky) Around a dozen officials are connected to the military think tank the RAND corporation. RAND is funded by the U.S. government, according to USA spending. Over half of its nearly $200 million in government funding this past year came from the DOD, according to the database. Former Secretary of the Navy Richard Danzig is listed as a member of RAND’s Board of Trustees, along with Chuck Hagel, according to RAND’s site. A member of NSL4A’s steering committee, former Ambassador Jeff Bleich, serves on the board of RAND Australia, according to RAND. Last year, RAND published a report detailing the potential consequences of prolonging the Ukraine-Russia conflict. However, two RAND directors later wrote an article in Foreign Policy advising against a peace deal with Russia.

The group’s president, Rear Admiral Michael E. Smith, founded National Security Leaders for Biden, according to the NSL4A site. Obama administration officials including former Ambassador Susan Rice and former national security advisor and speechwriter Ben Rhodes also signed the letter. There are at least 68 members who served in the intelligence community. Democrats overwhelmingly have a positive view of intelligence agencies while Republicans are increasingly skeptical, according to a Gallup poll.

Notably, Brennan previously signed a letter that characterized the New York Post story on Hunter Biden’s laptop as “Russian disinformation.” The Post’s story was verifiably true, as the Daily Caller News Foundation confirmed. Former Director of National Intelligence Jim Clapper and Senior Counselor at Palantir Technologies Wendy R. Anderson are listed among the members. Palantir is partly funded by the CIA, according to Reuters. Former Republican Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, although not on the list, also endorsed Harris.

Title: Bitcoin: THIS key level hints at BTC’s next bull run
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/bitcoin-this-key-level-hints-at-btcs-next-bull-run/
Time Published: 2024-09-30T22:00:54Z
Full Content:
Bitcoin’s recent price performance has been quite bullish. Here is a key metric to track further bullish momentum. Bitcoin [BTC] has recently shown signs of stabilization above the $64,000 mark, although it initially surged to $66,000 in the early hours of the 30th of September. Since then, a correction has brought the asset down to $64,633, marking a slight 1.4% decline. Despite this short-term dip, a broader view reveals Bitcoin’s growth, with the asset up by 10.2% over the past two weeks. However, the question remains: when will Bitcoin start the bull run that many experts predict could push its price into six figures? To provide clarity for investors, CryptoQuant, an on-chain data provider, has shared critical metrics for tracking Bitcoin’s bullish momentum. The platform published a series of posts on X (formerly Twitter) aimed at helping investors understand where Bitcoin might be headed. They noted that Bitcoin’s strong momentum over the past three weeks—rising over 23% from $52,500 to above $65,000—has been partly fueled by increased demand for spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). Notably, combined inflows from BlackRock, Fidelity, and Ark totaled $324 million on the 26th of September, signaling heightened interest from U.S. investors. Source: CryptoQuant According to CryptoQuant, one of the key drivers for Bitcoin’s recent rally is the resurgence of short-term holders back into profit territory. These holders, defined as investors who have moved their Bitcoin within the last 155 days, have an average purchase price of around $63,000. As Bitcoin’s price hovers above this level, it could act as a strong support level, reinforcing bullish sentiment. Source: CryptoQuant The futures market also offers significant insights into Bitcoin’s price trends. CryptoQuant revealed that Bitcoin’s Open Interest was $19.1 billion at press time. Historically, surges past $18.0 billion have led to price corrections. Source: CryptoQuant This marks the seventh time such a threshold has been crossed since March 2024, prompting caution around the possibility of a short-term dip. Despite this, the overall trend of increasing futures activity reflects growing investor confidence. Another notable development is the transformation of spot Bitcoin ETF holdings into long-term holder supply. As coins surpass the 155-day holding period, they are increasingly categorized as part of the long-term supply. Source: CryptoQuant While this shift might suggest a bullish outlook, CryptoQuant warns that such movements are often observed in the later stages of a bull market, indicating potential market maturity or a transition phase in Bitcoin’s trajectory. Beyond the fundamental metrics, several analysts have shared their perspectives on where Bitcoin could head next. Javon Marks, a prominent crypto analyst, suggested that Bitcoin was nearing a critical resistance level defined by a “descending broadening wedge” pattern. Source: Javon Marks/X According to Marks, a bullish breakout past this resistance could propel Bitcoin to a target range of $99,000 to $100,000, an increase of over 51% from its current price. His outlook emphasized that Bitcoin may be gearing up for a significant move in the coming weeks. Similarly, another analyst, Captain Faibik, noted that Bitcoin bulls currently hold a strong position in the market. Read Bitcoin’s [BTC] Price Prediction 2024–2025 With Bitcoin approaching a crucial resistance level of $68,000, Faibik speculated that a successful breakout from the broadening wedge could see the cryptocurrency reach $88,000 to $90,000 by the end of December. However, he also cautions that failure to break through this resistance, or a potential fake-out, could see Bitcoin retest support zones around $57,000.

By Laura Matthews, Suzanne McGee NEW YORK (Reuters) -The Texas Stock Exchange announced a board of directors on Monday in its latest step toward building a national exchange to rival long-established platforms in New York and said it was gearing up to launch trading next year. TXSE announced in June that it plans to register with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission with backing from BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) and Citadel Securities. It said on Monday it had secured $135 million. The exchange also said on Monday that Rick Perry, a former governor of Texas and former U.S. energy secretary, will be a board member. Other directors include Rick Roberts, a former SEC commissioner, and Alex Bussandri, global head of strategy at Citadel Securities. The exchange has also drawn staff members from Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange, a division of the Intercontinental Exchange (NYSE:ICE), as well as other trading platforms, it said on Monday. "Texas Stock Exchange is pulling big names in preparation for the potential launch in 2025," said Owen Lau, a senior analyst at Oppenheimer & Co, noting that the space is competitive. Nasdaq announced last week it put in place a regional management structure for its global listings franchise and appointed Texas-native Rachel Racz, as head of listings for Texas, Southern U.S. and Latin America. It didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. James Lee, founder and chief executive of TXSE Group Inc, said the exchange plans to submit a SEC registration in the coming months. After approval, he added that TXSE will execute its first trades by the end of 2025 and launch its listing early in 2026, making Dallas "a new hub for capital markets in the United States". Texas Governor Greg Abbott said on Monday that the exchange will ensure that businesses have access to capital and that market participants have more choice. The exchange also named Cam Smith as its global head of trading and co-president. Smith began his career working for electronic trading platforms and served as president of Quantlab, an automated proprietary trading firm. Jeff Brown, a former acting general counsel at Charles Schwab (NYSE:SCHW), is serving as general counsel of TXSE Group Inc and chief regulatory officer of the exchange. Nicole Chambers, who handled the Texas market for Nasdaq, will run corporate listings. Jeff Karcher and Marc Cunningham, who covered the southeast U.S. and Texas while working at the NYSE, will serve as global managing director.

Title: What To Expect in the Stock Market in Q4

Time Published: 2024-09-30T18:57:19Z
Full Content:
Stocks defied the odds in September, ticking up to trade at record highs despite the month's reputation as a notoriously rough patch for equities. The S&P 500 rose 5.5% in the third quarter, putting the index up nearly 21% in the first three quarters, its best year-to-date performance of the 21st century. But it was a tumultuous three months. In July and August, stocks recorded some of their best and worst days in years as investors grappled with recession fears and uncertainty about interest rates. Equities were given a lift in September by the Federal Reserve, which joined the ranks of global central banks easing monetary policy when it cut interest rates—by 50 basis points—for the first time in four years. The cut, according to officials, was a preemptive step to support the labor market, which data suggests is cooling but not falling apart. The fourth quarter is historically a strong one for stocks, and analysts—despite noting the likelihood of elevated volatility—are broadly optimistic about the outlook. As in the third quarter, the economy is likely to be top of mind for investors throughout the fourth quarter. Wall Street will especially be looking at labor market data for evidence of deterioration that would worry the Fed. Initial unemployment claims will be a key data point to keep an eye on, according to analysts at Russell Investments. Claims data, which is released weekly, has less of a lag than other labor market data. "These will provide the clearest real-time guidance on whether the U.S. economy is rebalancing or drifting towards recession," they say. Initial claims sustainably above 260,000 per week would be a red flag, in their view. The four-week average as of late September stood at about 225,000. Fed officials, in their most recent economic projections, penciled in another half-percentage-point cut from interest rates this year. An uptick in unemployment coupled with job losses could spur the Fed into more aggressive action at one of its two policy meetings. That would bring interest rates more in line with market expectations, but would likely also spook investors and do some damage to stock portfolios. The consensus on Wall Street is that the Fed is likely on track to achieve the soft landing it's been chasing for years, which bodes well for stocks. As of late September, the Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow calculator estimated the U.S. economy grew at an annual rate of 3.1% in the third quarter. Six of the last 10 rate-cutting cycles coincided with recessions. In those instances, the S&P 500 fell on average in the year after the first cut. In the four cycles that coincided with soft landings, the average return was in the high teens. Conventional wisdom says that small-cap stocks should benefit most from interest-rate cuts since they are more likely to have floating-rate debt. However, BlackRock analysts found that large caps have outperformed small caps during rate-cutting cycles since 1984, and that the outperformance is most pronounced outside of recessions. At the sector level, healthcare and consumer staples have performed the best during rate cuts, while communication services and tech have been the worst performers. The S&P 500, excluding the Magnificent Seven, in the second quarter grew aggregate earnings for the first time since 2022. Third-quarter results, which companies will begin reporting in mid-October, are expected to show the profitability gap between tech mega caps and the rest of the market is continuing to narrow. The Mag 7, meanwhile, faces the challenge of convincing Wall Street that their massive investments in artificial intelligence (AI) will pay off. They struggled to do so over the summer, sparking selloffs that the group has yet to fully rebound from. These stocks could continue to face pressure if their earnings fail to live up to Wall Street's lofty expectations. Political developments are likely to amplify stock volatility through the rest of the year, even if they don’t fundamentally change the economic or business outlook. The presidential election in November is one such event that could deliver Wall Street a short-term shock. BlackRock analysis found that, more often than not, the market's knee-jerk reaction to a presidential election is not indicative of its performance over the next year. Still, the presidential candidates have staked out positions on tariffs and corporate taxes that, if enacted, would surely change the outlook for U.S. businesses. Conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine could also keep the stock market on edge as long as they threaten to disrupt global trade or roil energy markets. Experts note, however, that volatility is a two-way street that can provide canny investors with opportunities to buy stocks at attractive valuations. Heightened volatility can also turbocharge short-term returns. Since 1990, the S&P 500 has returned 16% on average in the six months after the Cboe Volatility Index has risen to 29 or higher, compared with an average return of 5% in less volatile periods. Update—Sept. 30, 2024: This story has been updated with the S&P 500's quarterly performance as of the market close on Sept. 30.

Title: Goldman Trades Billions in Thames Water Debt as Hedge Funds Buy

(Bloomberg) -- Goldman Sachs Group Inc. has executed around £3 billion ($4 billion) of trades in Thames Water’s bonds in September, as it makes a market between original investors exiting the beleaguered utility and opportunistic players scooping up the debt at a discount. Hedge funds and distressed funds are continuing to bid for the debt of the UK’s largest water provider, said dealers at the US bank in a note to clients and seen by Bloomberg on Monday. The trading comes as the company has kicked off talks with creditors as it struggles to raise equity. Worries the firm will soon run out of cash led S&P Global Inc. and Moody’s Ratings to downgrade its Class A debt — deemed the safest — by five and six notches respectively last week. They also downgraded its riskier Class B debt. “The Thames structure remains topical at GS as risk continues to change hands post downgrade,” the bank said in the note. “Selling was initially in Class B debt, but more recently we’ve been sellers of Class A risk as well.” Buyers are favoring the more illiquid and lower cash price paper, as the market difference between shorter-dated and longer-dated bonds flattens, the note added. Companies with large amounts of debt often have bonds with wildly differing cash prices because notes are issued over multiple years at different points in the rate cycle. Goldman Sachs has also been trading some of Thames’s bank debt, with £145 million changing hands via its desk since April, according to the note. A spokesperson for Goldman Sachs did not immediately respond to a request for comment. S&P sees a debt restructuring — and consequently a default — as likely in the coming 12 months. The company has said it does not expect to receive funds in the form of equity ahead of a final determination by regulator Ofwat, expected at the earliest on Dec. 19. Thames has been negotiating with a group of creditors holding £10 billion of the company’s Class A debt over options to delay a potential liquidity shortfall. The group of creditors — including investors from BlackRock Inc. and Elliott Investment Management — has been working on its own plan to address the need for new funds and the unsustainable debt pile.

Title: BlackRock closes in on purchase of Thames Water contractor Lanes

The asset management behemoth's private markets arm has seen off competition from rival bidders in a deal likely to be worth more than £300m, Sky News learns. City editor @MarkKleinmanSky Monday 30 September 2024 17:39, UK An arm of BlackRock, the world's biggest asset manager, is closing in on a takeover of a major contractor to Thames Water even as the utility teeters on the brink of collapse. Sky News has learnt that BlackRock's private markets division could strike a deal to acquire Lanes Group, which is based in Leeds, within days. City insiders said that BlackRock had seen off competition from other suitors. It was unclear on Monday how much the asset management behemoth had agreed to pay for Lanes Group, although Sky News reported last month that the contractor was valued at up to £350m. BlackRock has begun to play an increasingly active role as a bidder in processes populated by conventional private equity firms. Lanes Group provides wastewater and drainage services, and generates a significant chunk of its revenues from Thames Water alongside other major water utilities. The industry is under intense pressure from the new Labour government, industry regulator Ofwat and other stakeholders amid public anger over wastage and pollution levels. Thames Water is battling to avoid temporary nationalisation as it faces running out of money within months unless it can raise additional funding. Sky News reported at the weekend that advisers to the utility, which has about 15m customers, have added Carlyle, the private equity firm, to a list of potential rescue investors. Blackrock declined to comment.

Drive business and brand growth with winning media strategies at Mediaweek. Hear from experts at TIME, Peloton, YouTube, Google and more, October 29-30 in New York City. Register. Will it take a maximum effort for Ryan Reynolds to go public? MNTN, the connected TV advertising platform where Reynolds serves as chief creative officer, tapped Morgan Stanley to explore a potential initial public offering, Bloomberg reports. The IPO could take place as soon as early next year, according to Bloomberg, with ongoing discussions being held about matters such as its timing and whether more financial institutions will participate. MNTN provides software that enables brands to create and manage ad campaigns on CTV platforms, highlighted by its MNTN Performance TV platform, a suite of automated optimization technology, measurement, and targeting tools. After collaborating on the first two Deadpool films, Reynolds and George Dewey formed Maximum Effort Marketing in 2018, and its campaigns for another Reynolds venture, Aviation Gin, fueled the agency’s rise to prominence. In June 2021, MNTN agreed to acquire Maximum Effort, permitting it to retain its identity as a creative agency within the MNTN portfolio, retaining Dewey as Maximum Effort’s president, and naming Reynolds CCO of MNTN. Dewey told ADWEEK shortly after the deal was announced, “The biggest benefit is cultural. We wanted to grow, but not in a way where it meant adding layers and pitches and processes that can sometimes take the joy and speed out of marketing.” The company raised $119 million in a Series D financing round in 2021, according to Bloomberg, co-led by funds and accounts managed by BlackRock and Fidelity Management & Research. MNTN added three members to its board of directors in March 2023 to help it manage the company’s growth: retired accountant Joe B. Johnson, Code.org founder and CEO Hadi Partovi, and Deep Sync CEO Grant Ries. Jay Stevens joined the company in June 2023 as general manager, international, after serving as president of omnichannel media buying and media accounting software company Hudson MX. David Cohen is a freelance writer for ADWEEK, covering breaking news.
