The cryptocurrency industry has been about hitting new milestones in 2025, with the futures-based Solana and XRP ETFs (exchange-traded funds) among the latest to reach new achievements. According to the latest market data, the SOL and XRP ETFs have reached $1 billion in total capital inflows since their launch earlier. This feat comes on the back of rumors that the world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock, might look to launch a spot XRP-based exchange-traded fund. In an August 9 post on the X platform, the president of The ETF Store, Nate Geraci, revealed that the futures-based Solana and XRP ETFs have attracted over $1 billion in capital since launch. These crypto-linked investment products started trading in the United States about five months ago—around March (for SOL ETF) and April (for XRP). For context, futures-based exchange-traded funds are a type of investment product that holds the futures contracts of an asset. A futures contract is a financial instrument that allows an investor to buy an asset at a predetermined price on a predetermined date. In March 2025, Volatility Shares launched the first-ever Solana exchange-traded funds in the United States. The firm rolled out two products at the time: Volatility Shares’ Solana fund, which replicates the performance of Solana futures, and the 2x SOL ETF that offers double-leveraged exposure. While Teucrium launched the first US-based XRP ETF (a 2x leveraged fund) in April, Volatility Shares offered the first non-leveraged futures-based XRP exchange-traded fund in May. As shown in the chart below, both the SOL and XRP ETFs had posted only modest monthly performances up until July—where they each posted approximately $350 million in capital inflows. Geraci noted that these figures include REX-Osprey’s Solana staking exchange-traded fund, which boasts up to $150 million in assets under management. According to the ETF expert, this performance proves that there will be demand for spot SOL and XRP ETFs. It is worth mentioning that a slew of applications from various asset managers are awaiting approval from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch Solana and XRP ETFs. As reported by Bitcoinist, BlackRock has indicated that it currently has no plans to join the race for spot Solana and XRP ETFs. In a second post on X, Geraci reiterated his belief that BlackRock would be looking to expand its crypto ETF portfolio. “And I’m being told BlackRock doesn’t want a piece of this?” the ETF expert said, referring to the attention being enjoyed by the future-based version of the XRP exchange-traded fund.

Title: U.S. Spot XRP ETFs: Five Possible Reasons Behind BlackRock’s Hesitation to File for One

BlackRock has made bold moves into bitcoin and ether ETFs, but on Friday, the asset manager said it had no immediate plans to file for a spot XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF), dashing the community’s hopes that its entry could help extend XRP’s 2025 rally. This statement — made the day after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple Labs jointly asked an appeals court to dismiss their respective appeals, signaling an end to their nearly five-year legal battle — has left investors questioning why BlackRock remains on the sidelines. While several asset managers, including ProShares, Grayscale, and Bitwise, have filed for XRP ETFs since late 2024, BlackRock’s absence is notable, especially given its dominance in the bitcoin and ether ETF markets. Here are five reasons why BlackRock appears in no hurry to launch a spot XRP ETF, despite the XRP community’s anticipation of a demand-driven price surge. First, BlackRock has cited limited client interest in cryptocurrencies beyond BTC and ETH. Back in March 2024, Robert Mitchnick, the asset manager's head of digital assets, said that there's a misconception that BlackRock will have a "long tail" of other crypto services. "I can say that for our client base, bitcoin is overwhelmingly the No. 1 focus and a little bit ethereum," he said during a fireside chat at the inaugural Bitcoin Investor Day conference in New York on March 22. Second, BlackRock’s strategic caution around regulatory uncertainty plays a role. Although XRP sales on public exchanges are deemed non-securities, the broader regulatory framework for altcoins remains murky. BlackRock may be waiting for clearer SEC guidelines before entering the altcoin ETF space. The firm’s conservative approach contrasts with competitors like ProShares, which filed for a spot XRP ETF in January 2025 alongside leveraged and futures-based XRP ETFs, the latter tracking XRP futures contracts rather than the token’s spot price. Third, BlackRock may see diminishing returns in pursuing a spot XRP ETF given the crowded field. As of August 2025, at least seven firms, including Grayscale, Franklin Templeton and 21Shares, have a pending spot XRP ETF application. Fourth, the XRP community’s expectations of a price surge may not align with BlackRock’s data-driven strategy. Polymarket odds for the SEC approving a spot XTP ETF in 2025 stand at 77%. BlackRock's tokenized money market fund on Ethereum and Solana shows blockchain interest, but XRP’s smaller market footprint may not justify the operational costs of a new ETF. Finally, BlackRock’s global perspective prioritizes markets where XRP demand is less pronounced. While the XRP community, active on platforms like X, anticipates a spot ETF driving demand, much of XRP’s trading volume comes from Asia, where BlackRock’s ETF presence is less dominant. At press time, XRP was trading around $3.1852, down 3.92% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinDesk Data.

Title: BlackRock Says XRP And SOL ETFs Not In The Cards Despite Long-Running Ripple-SEC Case Officially Ending

The conclusive end of Ripple’s nearly five-year-long lawsuit indicated the possibility for Wall Street titans such as BlackRock to file to introduce a spot XRP exchange-traded fund. BlackRock, however, has clarified that it has no immediate plans to offer a potential XRP ETF or Solana (SOL) fund. “At this time, BlackRock does not have any plans to file an XRP or SOL ETF,” a BlackRock representative reportedly told The Block on Friday. The clarification came shortly after NovaDius Wealth President Nate Geraci suggested that BlackRock would eventually foray into the XRP ETF market as the Securities and Exchange Commission and Ripple have officially ended their five-year legal battle after jointly withdrawing their appeals in the XRP case. As ZyCrypto reported earlier, the Second Circuit Appeals Court recognized the filing, with both parties bearing their own legal fees. According to Geraci, it’s hard to justify overlooking crypto assets beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, but if BlackRock avoids issuing other crypto ETFs, they’re basically stating that only BTC and ETH are worth investing in. “Otherwise, they’re basically saying btc & eth are only ones that will ever have value. Bold,” the pundit added. Geraci noted in a follow-up post that futures-based SOL and XRP exchange-traded funds went live in March and April, respectively, and have since pulled in more than $1 billion in new investor money. While less impactful on price than a spot fund, he believes this is a sign that spot XRP and Solana ETFs, once approved, will attract “real demand.” And I’m being told BlackRock doesn’t want a piece of this?Ok. Asset managers, including ProShares, WisdomTree, 21Shares, Canary, and Bitwise, have all submitted paperwork with the SEC for a potential XRP ETF. In June, analysts at Bloomberg upped their odds of spot XRP, Dogecoin, and Cardano ETF approvals getting launched before the end of 2025 to 90%. Meanwhile, Canada is a step ahead. 3iQ’s spot XRP ETFs, XRPQ and XRPQ.U, started trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange in mid-June, swiftly accumulating roughly $50 million in assets under management, the company proclaimed in a post on X.

Title: What investing in private equity and crypto means for your 401(k)

Time Published: 2025-08-10T11:03:41Z

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Your 401(k) options could change soon. President Donald Trump signed an executive order Thursday to clear the way for Americans to invest their retirement savings in private equity, cryptocurrency, real estate and other alternative assets. It’s a big win for the asset industry — giving financial managers access to some of the $12.2 trillion in Americans’ 401(k) and related retirement plans. Private assets can also be more lucrative, and the Trump administration said they can give retirement savers more opportunities. “The theoretical benefits are that everyday Americans can invest in a broader menu of companies,” said Robert Brokamp, a financial planning expert at stock market research company The Motley Fool. But there are higher risks — and not necessarily higher rewards. Critics say it could put people in danger of losing a huge chunk of their retirement savings. “There is a lot less transparency and liquidity in private markets,” said Brokamp. “There’s not as much information about the companies, and it could be hard to sell your investments — especially during a panic and many, many investors are trying to sell at the same time.” Plus the fees are higher for private assets than for typical 401(k) investments like mutual funds and ETFs. Benjamin Schiffrin, director of securities policy at Better Markets, said target-date mutual funds holding stocks and bonds charge 0.3% — while private funds can charge 1% to 2% in management fees and up to 20% in performance fees, and interval funds charge 2% to 3%. Right now, private equity is technically allowed in retirement plans, but it’s rare — though some companies like BlackRock are planning new offerings. There are ways people can invest in crypto through their 401(k)s, too, but it’s also not common. And many 401(k) recordkeepers don’t support private equity funds yet. The executive order could change that. It directs the Department of Labor to re-examine its guidance and clarify its position on alternative assets like private market investments, real estate interests and digital assets within 180 days. And it tells the Securities and Exchange Commission to consider ways to facilitate access to alternative assets for plans like 401(k)s. “I think this is going to open the floodgates,” said Schiffrin. “I think up until now, you’ve actually seen a lot of hesitancy on the part of 401(k) plan managers to go down the road of including private market assets like private equity and private credit, things like that in the 401(k) plans.” Employers would have to decide to offer the plans — and experts anticipate many might be reluctant, as they could be held liable for losses. However, with updated guidance from the government, employers may feel more comfortable adding these alternative assets into their 401(k)s. Many experts say that might not be a good thing. SageMint Wealth managing partner Anh Tran, a certified financial planner and attorney, believes there’s a real risk that some investors will be drawn in by the allure of potentially higher returns from alternative investments without having the full picture. She said she would not advise anyone to make this kind of investment unless they fully understand the risk of losing that money entirely. “It could be detrimental to less-informed investors whose only investment account is their 401(k),” said Tran. “Without proper guardrails, such as limiting exposure to 5% to 10% of the portfolio, these investors could be exposed to unnecessary risk, misaligned expectations and potentially irreversible losses.” Knut Rostad, co-founder and president of the nonprofit Institute for the Fiduciary Standard, also fears private assets in 401(k)s could put retirement savers at risk of big losses. “I think in practice, there’ll be many fiduciaries who ignore this directive because they understand precisely what will result from it,” he said, referring to Trump’s executive order. “The result will be a massive train wreck where many people are seriously hurt. Their retirement accounts will be annihilated.” And cryptocurrencies come with their own dangers. “It’s not clear what, if any, protections investors are going to have when it comes to investing in crypto,” said Better Markets’ Schiffrin. “So that just is a whole separate category of risks that having crypto in 401(k)s opens up.” Meanwhile the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, a trade organization for broker-dealers, investment banks and asset managers, cheered the announcement as a win for retirement savers. “As more U.S. companies choose to remain non-public, private markets have developed into a more robust asset class,” Kenneth E. Bentsen Jr., president and CEO of SIFMA, said in a statement. “Access to such investments, however, has been limited primarily to institutional and high net worth investors.” He continued: “Policy changes to expand access to private markets investments — appropriately tailored under ERISA and SEC rules — could serve to improve diversification, democratize access, and offer more investment choices to the benefit of everyday retirement savers.” Experts believe it could take months to see any changes. For now, they say education and safeguards are key — especially for younger investors and people without access to professional financial advice. “There must be transparency, education and limits in place to prevent widespread harm,” said Tran. “Otherwise, we could be setting the stage for not only ﬁnancial loss, but broader economic and social consequences.” Kayla Steinberg is a producer at NBC News covering business and the economy.

Title: Bitcoin Bulls In Control: $120,000 Test Could Trigger Run Toward ATH

Bitcoin (BTC) prices are currently hovering near $118,000 after a modest price recovery in the last week resulted in a 4.17% price gain. With a new week ahead, a top market analyst with X username KillaXBT shares some technical insights on the present Bitcoin market structure and also discusses potential price developments. Related Reading: Harvard Reveals $117M BlackRock Bitcoin ETF Stake In SEC Filing – Details In an X post on August 9, KillaXBT gives a weekly analysis report of the Bitcoin price’s movement for the first week in August while also sharing future projections. In their observations, the market expert notes that Bitcoin started the month on a strong technical footing, flipping the monthly open at $115,752 into support, a move traders often interpret as a bullish signal. However, KillaXBT explains that Bitcoin historically tends to wick either up or down in a new month, forming one side of the monthly candle’s wick in a pattern sometimes referred to by traders as the “monthly open trap.” Therefore, the current setup has market watchers closely monitoring for either a sustained uptrend or a liquidity-driven retracement before continuation. In terms of liquidity, the crypto analyst has also observed that significant 2-week BTC liquidations are building above the $120,000 mark. This zone is also aligned with the previous weekly open ($119,414), creating a high-probability target should bullish structure remain intact. At present, BTC is testing a lower-timeframe (LTF) downtrend line. KillaXBT explains that a confirmed break above this trendline could pave the way for a decisive move toward $120,000 and beyond, while traders remain wary of potential liquidity hunts that could briefly push price lower before resuming the uptrend. Two main scenarios are now emerging for traders. First, BTC could maintain its bullish structure, continuing the climb toward the $120,000 liquidity pool and potentially targeting the $123,186 monthly high (ATH). This path aligns with the current technical structure, which shows no immediate signs of bearish continuation. Alternatively, Bitcoin could fail to break higher, instead forming a lower high and slipping back under $115,700. In such a case, the next major support lies in the $110,000–$112,000 range, marked by the monthly fair value gap (FVG) at $111,955. Presently, KillaXBT believes scenario one appears more likely as the market is holding bullish momentum, and with absent clear bearish signals, the analyst expects BTC to attempt higher highs in the coming days. However, traders should also expect BTC could briefly dip early in the week, particularly Monday or Tuesday, to clear overleveraged long positions before rallying. In rounding off, the market expert states a sustained pattern of higher highs and higher lows on intraday charts would further validate the bullish outlook, while a failure to hold these levels could quickly shift sentiment toward the bearish alternative. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $117,792 following a 1.11% gain in the last day. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: BlackRock Confirms No Current XRP Or Solana Spot ETF Filings

BlackRock has confirmed that the company is not currently pursuing spot ETFs for Ripple’s XRP or Solana, despite market rumors. While the XRP and SOL communities may be disappointed by the lack of immediate action, the acknowledgment from BlackRock validates their relevance in the broader crypto market. In a recent update from The Block, BlackRock has clarified that the company currently has no plans to file for spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tied to Ripple’s XRP or SOL. This aligns with BlackRock’s cautious approach, as reflected in earlier comments from executives like CEO Larry Fink and CIO Samara Cohen. Both have emphasized their focus on Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs for now. According to MartyParty, the world’s largest asset manager noted that they are actively exploring assets like SOL and XRP for potential future offerings rather than spot ETFs. However, the industry speculation, fueled by analysts like Nate Geraci, suggests that BlackRock could consider filing for SOL and XRP Ripple spot ETFs by an October 2025 deadline. This potential move is believed to be driven by mounting competitive pressures in the crypto ETF space and recent regulatory developments. These include the SEC’s approval of in-kind creation and redemption mechanisms, which enhance the efficiency of ETF operations. Furthermore, no official filings have been made yet, and any decision to proceed would likely depend on regulatory clarity. While the ongoing speculation that BlackRock could consider filing for SOL and XRP, an analyst known as Web3BPP has also revealed that Ripple has officially closed its nearly five-year legal battle with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Web3BPP stated that the court has confirmed that XRP sales on secondary markets are not securities transactions. According to the expert, this news has sent the altcoin’s price up by 11% reaching $3.33, capping off a remarkable 31% monthly gain and an impressive nearly 500% increase over the past year. Analysts are now setting their sights on $8 short-term price target for XRP, while some long-term forecasts envision prices soaring as high as $1,000 by 2030, due to their belief that BlackRock could consider filing for a spot XRP ETF by October. A move expected to bring in billions of dollars in fresh institutional capital. The expert also drew attention to Ethereum, which has gained 7% this week, reaching $3,908, driven largely by whale buying and expanding adoption by corporate treasuries. This surge reflects growing confidence in ETH as both a store of value and a strategic asset for businesses. Market experts are bullish on ETH’s future, with many projecting a price target of $5,000 by the end of the year. This rally is expected to be supported by interest in ETH-based ETFs and upcoming network upgrades designed to enhance performance and security. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: BlackRock To File For XRP ETF After Ripple-SEC Settlement? Market Expert Answers

Ripple Labs and the US SEC have finally closed the book on their high-profile lawsuit after almost five years of legal back-and-forth. According to a joint filing with the Second Circuit Court of Appeals on Thursday, both sides agreed to drop their appeals, making Judge Analisa Torres’s 2023 ruling final. The resolution has already been factored into XRP’s price surge above $3 again. It has also led to an interesting speculation from market expert Nate Geraci, who suggested that BlackRock may now look to file for an iShares XRP ETF. The end of the case immediately prompted discussion about whether BlackRock, Wall Street’s biggest asset manager, will launch a Spot XRP ETF. Geraci, president of The ETF Store, shared on X that he believes BlackRock may have been waiting for this moment before filing for an iShares XRP ETF. “Makes zero sense for them to ignore crypto assets beyond btc & eth,” he wrote. According to him, limiting exposure to just Bitcoin and Ethereum would be like saying they’re the only assets that will ever matter. That stance is very questionable given the altcoin’s price performance since last year. Given BlackRock’s success with its Spot Bitcoin and Spot Ethereum ETFs, the XRP ETF is the logical next step, as the third-largest cryptocurrency. If BlackRock were to launch an XRP ETF, it could be a game-changer for the token’s price performance. At the time of writing, BlackRock holds the largest share of assets in both Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in the US. The firm’s Spot Bitcoin ETF, iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), has dominated inflows since launch and is currently holding $86.53 billion in net assets. Furthermore, its iShares Ethereum Trust has quickly become the leader among Ethereum ETFs with $12.35 billion in net assets. Polymarket now puts the odds of an XRP ETF approval at 76%, although it reached as high as 88.7% on August 8. However, Bloomberg’s ETF analyst Eric Balchunas is leaning on the cautious side. In response to Nate Geraci’s post, Balchunas disagreed and noted that the firm is likely satisfied with its existing crypto offerings. He doesn’t expect one to be filed this year, but the longer-term outlook is harder to call. It appears BlackRock is in no rush to expand its ETF lineup for now. A BlackRock spokesperson told The Block on Friday that the company currently has no plans for a spot XRP ETF, or one for Solana. However, that doesn’t mean the door is closed forever. XRP’s price jumped more than 11% on the news of the settlement. Its price went from $3.04 and jumped to $3.36 in just a few hours after news of the settlement broke out. At the time of writing, the altcoin is trading at $3.32. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Tokens that are designed to be digital twins of stocks have subtle differences that make them less identical and more fraternal to the securities they're supposed to replicate. Tokenization was theoretical when BlackRock chief Larry Fink publicly discussed it in early 2024, but has landed in the real world via popular trading platforms including Robinhood (HOOD), Kraken and Coinbase Global (COIN). While they haven't cleared regulatory hurdles for U.S. investors' yet, rollouts of stock tokens in Europe started in June, ratcheting up the competition between trading venues that offer, or plan to offer, them to their customers. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, who unveiled the crypto exchange's tokenization ambitions in late July, quantified the business case for it: Just 3% in equities trading market share would double the current crypto market. "We've always said we're updating the system and building the bridge to bring equities on to crypto rails is the next phase of our strategy," he said. Anything can be made into tokens, from mortgage contracts representing real estate to shares in special purpose vehicles (SPVs) that reference the price of the underlying assets—whether they are publicly traded stocks or stakes in private companies, the latter of which made headlines when Robinhood unveiled OpenAI and SpaceX stock tokens. Robinhood chief Vlad Tenev, during the company's recent earnings call, said that the true opportunity in tokenization is in inaccessible assets like private market assets, according to a transcript provided by AlphaSense. He also said there was a "very positive" reception to stock tokens. "It's clear customers want this," he said. "They not only want it in Europe but they want it in the U.S. as well." OpenAI, the ChatGPT maker, has publicly said that it was not associated with the OpenAI stock tokens launched by Robinhood. The private-asset "stock tokens" weren't technically equity, but derivative contracts. Kraken, the U.S.'s oldest crypto exchange, has taken a different tack to tokenization. It partnered with a company called Backed to roll out xStocks. They trade on Solana and BNB Chain, but will likely show up on other blockchains as the so-called xStocks Alliance, a network of exchanges and decentralized finance protocols, grows. Kraken's consumer business chief Mark Greenberg, in an interview with Investopedia, said that the exchange's stock tokens aren't derivatives, but "actually backed by real stocks." As Greenberg explained it: Its partner Backed runs an SPV in New Jersey that holds stocks, and for each stock an investor buys, they mint a corresponding token, which they destroy when the underlying stock is sold, and the cash value given to the user. They are not technically equity but debt instruments that grant their holders the right to the cash value of the underlying shares, but not the shares themselves. Kraken hopes to eventually enable XStocks holders to redeem the underlying assets rather than their cash value, Greenberg said. Coinbase may come up with a whole different model, but the crypto exchange has not yet set a timeline. That said, U.S. securities regulators appear to be more receptive to them than they were in the past.

XRP, one of the best performing major cryptocurrencies over the last year with a near 500% gain, has climbed 12% this week, helping the combined crypto market top $4 trillion. “This could mark a major milestone in bringing digital assets into the mainstream financial infrastructure, opening the door to long-term adoption by everyday Americans,” Antony Agoshkov, cofounder of Marvel Capital, said in emailed comments. The order gives the Department of Labor 180 days to review rules with any changes not expected to be seen immediately in bitcoin and crypto markets. “The Trump executive order opening the door to the inclusion of crypto and private assets in 401(k) retirement plans opens the way to greater choice and gives investors more options," Katalin Tischhauser, head of research at Sygnum Bank, said via email. “It is another bullish driver for the crypto market as the relatively small market capitalisation means fund flows can have a significant impact on price." In May, the Department of Labor scrapped guidance from 2022 that urged "extreme care" before any investment companies added crypto to retirement account options. “The announcement has fueled optimism around future institutional inflows, especially given the size of the U.S. defined contribution market, which totals around $10 trillion," Joel Kruger, market strategist at LMAX Group, said in emailed comments. "A more favorable regulatory tone is taking shape in Washington. The Trump executive order follows a series of signals from lawmakers aimed at establishing clearer guardrails around digital asset classification and access.” While there is currently no prohibition on retirement plan operators adding these types of investments, the order is expected to result in a more diverse range of options for people. “This order isn’t about the government saying 'crypto belongs in 401(k)s.’ It’s about the government getting out of the way and letting people make their own decisions,” Matt Hougan, chief investment officer at Bitwise, said in an emailed note. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free newsletter for the crypto-curious The latest bullish signal out of the Trump White House—following Trump dismantling Biden-era crypto restrictions on Wall Street, Trump ordering the creation of a bitcoin strategic reserve and crypto stockpile that’s expected to include ethereum and XRP among others, and the passage of the Genius Act stablecoin bill—are helping to “shift sentiment” among traders, but have yet to translate into meaningful price moves. “Trump’s latest moves—from expanding 401(k) access to crypto, to pushing gold into the spotlight—could shift sentiment, but so far the response has been muted,” 10x Research founder Markus Thielen said in an emailed note. “Ethereum, meanwhile, is flashing record address activity and surging prices, yet much of the move appears narrative-driven rather than grounded in fundamentals. Both assets are now pressing against key technical boundaries where momentum could either accelerate or stall sharply." Bitcoin and crypto market watchers remain bullish for the rest of 2025, however, some are warning the bitcoin price and crypto market could crash next year. “My view is that once we complete the bull cycle at circa $140,000-$145,000, we will see a corrective bear market in 2026, but I am not looking for a deep correct, but likely a move to $90,000 to $100,000,” John Glover, chief investment officer of Ledn, said in emailed comments, adding: “I know this goes against the popular view that we are going to hit the extreme prognosticator’s views of $250,000, $500,000, or even $1 million in 2025 or 2026." Meanwhile, Trump also signed a separate executive order targeting the “debanking” of people and businesses on political grounds, which will “ensure that Federal regulators do not promote policies and practices that allow financial institutions to deny or restrict services based on political beliefs, religious beliefs or lawful business activities, ensuring fair access to banking for all Americans.” The "digital assets industry has also been the target of unfair debanking initiatives," according to a White House fact sheet, with Caitlin Long, the chief executive of crypto-focused Custodia Bank, cheering the addition of the Small Business Administration as an overseer of the federal banking regulators.

Title: Ethereum price forecast: ETH rockets past $4K, this ETH token is being dubbed future of payments

For those familiar with the crypto-space, it’s clear that Ethereum (ETH) holds the record as the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency. Better still, it made headlines late 2021 when it reached the ATH of $4,000, making a FOMO to set in as no one, including institutional and retail markets, wanted to be left out. Today, the ETH trades around the $4,000 mark, and many big bag holders are watching keenly as they anticipate the next move regarding Ethereum price projections. They are asking: Where is the next target for ETH? Would such moves affect other Ethereum-based tokens positively or even outperform ETH in the months to come? For instance, one token is attracting increasing attention: Remittix (RTX), an ERC-20 asset designed to address the issue of global money transfers. As Ethereum strengthens its base with spot ETF inflows, gas fee optimizations, and renewed DeFi/NFT activity, some traders believe RTX could emerge as the real breakout payment token in the Ethereum ecosystem. It’s a lot of information, but we will flesh it out together shortly. Several major tailwinds have fueled Ethereum’s climb above $4,000: What’s more, different Ethereum price projections are showing that ETH could hit a new ATH if it manages to break through the old ATH and move towards $5,500–$6,000 by Q1 2026, especially should the macro fundamentals agree. However, while ETH remains a huge part of crypto whales’ portfolios, they are also exploring and positioning themselves in other Ethereum-based tokens that could feel the impact of the big ETH bullish move that’s to come. One notable one is Remittix. Remittix (RTX) is an Ethereum-based token explicitly developed for one use case: cross-border money transfers. The platform bridges crypto and fiat through a remittance model that avoids the costly intermediaries that dominate traditional remittance routes. Here’s why traders are calling it “the future of payments” within the Ethereum ecosystem: Ethereum’s current rally is likely just the beginning. The infrastructure upgrades, ETF exposure, and global DeFi revival position ETH as a long-term winner. But for those aiming to maximize upside potential, assets like Remittix represent a unique opportunity. As the Ethereum price climbs, keep an eye on the tokens it carries with it, and don’t be surprised if RTX becomes one of the most talked-about names before the next altcoin season is over.

Title: Three Revolutions by Simon Hall: Lenin, Mao and Fidel’s biggest overseas fans came from an unexpected source

Irish people can be as susceptible as anyone to the charms of a communist dictator. Michael Collins and Éamon de Valera approved a $20,000 loan from Sinn Féin to Vladimir Lenin’s Bolsheviks. Young Bob Geldof distributed 100 copies of Mao Zedong’s Little Red Book around Blackrock College, while President Michael D Higgins paid a warm tribute to Fidel Castro when the “giant among global leaders” died in 2016. As Simon Hall shows in his lively, insightful but disjointed study of how revolutions shaped the 20st century, however, Lenin, Mao and Fidel’s biggest overseas fans came from a more unexpected source. Three American journalists played key roles in presenting these tyrants to the West as principled, charismatic and a force for good. Hall frames his episodic narrative around six gruelling journeys that led to either a coup or a scoop. In 1917 Lenin and around 30 other Russian dissidents took a train from Zurich across war-torn Germany to Petrograd’s Finland Station, where his fiery rhetoric inspired the world’s first Soviet republic. That was a cakewalk compared with Mao’s Long March, the 6,000-mile retreat from Chinese nationalist forces in 1934-5 that cost more than 80,000 lives but still established him as the Communist Party’s toughest leader. Castro ended his exile in 1956 by sailing from Mexico to Cuba on what Hall calls “a creaking, leaking leisure yacht”, escaping into the Sierra Maestra mountains and plotting a guerrilla war. The newspaper men profiled here are less familiar, but formidable characters in their own right. John Reed was a bohemian poet who watched Saint Petersburg’s Winter Palace being stormed and penned the Lenin-approved bestseller Ten Days that Shook the World. The goofy, part-Irish Edgar Snow spent three months living among Red Army troops and obediently wrote up Mao’s autobiography. Donnish veteran Herbert Matthews hiked through a dangerous wilderness to secure his star-struck interview with Castro, which caused a sensation when it appeared on the New York Times’s front page. Three Revolutions works best on a storytelling level, full of colourful human details such as Lenin drawing up rules for who could use his carriage toilet. While Hall is clear-eyed about his despotic subjects, however, he goes a little too easy on the newshounds. Journalism may be the first draft of history, but sadly the copy these naive idealists delivered has turned out to need a radical rewrite.

Title: Harvard Reveals $117M BlackRock Bitcoin ETF Stake In SEC Filing – Details

Time Published: 2025-08-09T06:30:01Z

Bitcoin continues to solidify its status as a strategic reserve asset, with growing institutional adoption fueling its long-term bullish narrative. The latest major endorsement comes from one of the world’s most prestigious universities — Harvard. In a recent SEC filing, it was revealed that Harvard University’s investment portfolio acquired $117 million worth of shares in BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF by the end of the second quarter of 2025. This move places Harvard among a growing list of influential institutions integrating Bitcoin into their long-term treasury strategies. The BlackRock spot Bitcoin ETF, now managing $84 billion in assets under management, has quickly become a dominant vehicle for institutional exposure to BTC. Harvard’s decision highlights a broader shift in capital allocation strategies, where Bitcoin is increasingly being viewed as a hedge against macroeconomic uncertainty and a high-conviction growth asset. Institutional participation at this scale not only boosts market credibility but also reinforces Bitcoin’s position as a core asset in diversified portfolios. According to Harvard University’s recent Form 13F filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), its $117 million position in BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF ranks as the institution’s fifth-largest investment. This allocation places Bitcoin just ahead of the university’s holdings in major technology giants such as Alphabet, Google’s parent company, and NVIDIA. At the end of the reporting period, Harvard held nearly $114 million worth of Alphabet stock, underscoring the significance of its Bitcoin exposure within its broader portfolio. The decision to prioritize Bitcoin over some of the most established names in global technology signals a notable shift in institutional thinking. For decades, elite endowments like Harvard’s have been known for their conservative, long-term investment approach, focusing on assets with proven resilience and growth potential. Including Bitcoin at this level shows that the university views the digital asset as not only a speculative opportunity but also as a strategic reserve holding with long-term value. Harvard’s move reflects a growing consensus among leading institutions that BTC is emerging as a core asset for diversification, inflation protection, and asymmetric upside potential. The fact that Bitcoin now sits alongside — and in some cases above — blue-chip equities in major portfolios highlights its evolution from a niche investment to a mainstream financial instrument. Bitcoin (BTC) is currently trading at $116,526, consolidating just below the key resistance zone at $122,077. The 3-day chart shows a sustained bullish structure, with price holding well above the 50-day ($101,725) and 100-day ($96,494) moving averages — both trending upward, signaling strong medium-term momentum. After reclaiming the $115,724 support level, BTC has maintained a steady upward bias, suggesting that bulls are still in control despite recent volatility. The consolidation phase just under resistance indicates market indecision, with buyers accumulating strength for a potential breakout. A decisive close above $122,077 could open the path toward retesting the all-time highs and potentially extending into price discovery. Volume remains relatively stable, but a noticeable uptick on breakout attempts would strengthen the bullish case. On the downside, failure to hold $115,724 could trigger a pullback toward the $110K–$112K range, where additional support and the 50-day moving average converge.

Title: BlackRock rules out XRP and SOL ETFs despite Ripple-SEC case closure

Time Published: 2025-08-09T05:19:29Z

Share this article With Ripple closing its long-running legal battle with the SEC, industry analysts anticipate that the resolution will make major fund managers more comfortable offering investment products tied to XRP, Ripple’s native crypto asset. Pro-XRP users, in particular, have been eyeing BlackRock, the asset management giant. But it appears BlackRock has no immediate plans to get on board. A BlackRock spokesperson recently told The Block that spot XRP and Solana (SOL) ETFs are not on the firm’s roadmap for now. The confirmation came shortly after ETF Store President Nate Geraci suggested that BlackRock would eventually enter the XRP ETF market as Ripple and the SEC wrap up their appeals. He said it’s hard to justify ignoring crypto assets apart from Bitcoin and Ethereum, but if BlackRock really stays away from other crypto ETFs, they’re essentially stating that only BTC and ETH are worth investing in. Yes, I think BlackRock was waiting to see this before filing for iShares XRP ETF… I’ll own it if I’m wrong. IMO, makes *zero* sense for them to ignore crypto assets beyond btc & eth. Otherwise, they’re basically saying btc & eth are only ones that will ever have value. Bold. pic.twitter.com/FtBqMRFpOl — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) August 8, 2025 However, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas thinks BlackRock is content with its two existing ETFs, those tied to the two largest crypto assets, and sees diminishing returns in expanding further. I just think they are happy w the two. Law of diminish returns from here on out. But again I’ve nothing to go on but my own spidey sense here. — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) August 8, 2025 The analyst is also doubtful that BlackRock will file for an index-based crypto ETF, which potentially includes major assets like XRP, later this year. Robert Mitchnick, BlackRock’s Head of Digital Assets, revealed at the Bitcoin 2024 convention that there was ‘very little’ client demand for crypto ETFs beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. Samara Cohen, BlackRock’s Chief Investment Officer of ETF and Index Investments, said in an interview with Bloomberg that the firm would not launch a Solana ETF in the near term. “We really look at the investor’s ability to see what meets the criteria, what meets the bar to be delivered in an ETF,” Cohen said. “For us right now, both between [investing] ability considerations and also what we hear from our clients… Bitcoin and Ether definitely meet that bar. I think it will be a while before we see anything else.” Share this article Sign in to your account Don’t have an account? Create one Create your account Already have an account?

Title: A beginner’s guide to orange wine – is it the new rosé?

Time Published: 2025-08-09T04:00:00Z
Full Content:
Orange wine has been fashionable in wine bars for years and now seems to be taking off elsewhere too. If you are still wondering what it is, think “white wine made like red wine”, as one producer explained it to me. White grapes are crushed and left in contact with the skins, and sometimes pips and stalks too, for a period ranging from hours to days to months. Sometimes called skin contact or amber wine, it was the traditional way to make white wine in many areas before modern technology arrived. It has been made in Georgia and neighbouring Armenia for thousands of years and still is today. More recently it has been revived by winemakers in Slovenia, Friuli and now elsewhere too. In Georgia orange wine is usually macerated, fermented and/or aged in clay amphorae or qvevri, although producers in other countries sometimes use stainless steel or wood. It runs from pale gold to deep brown in colour. Some are a little cloudy, too. Producers are now playing with different hues to create light, fruity summer wines, sometimes called sunset wines because of their pinkish, reddish orange colour. The term can also include rosé and light pale red wines that are served cool. As the juice has been in contact with the skins, orange wines can be lightly tannic, which makes them good with food. They should be served cool or at room temperature rather than chilled as this will highlight the drying tannins in the wine. Provided your fellow wine drinkers like orange wine, it is a great all-purpose party wine that will happily match with all kinds of food, from spicy Indian to grilled red and white meat to salads, pickles and dips. They make nice aperitifs, too: a little bit fruity with a touch of astringency. Fresh and floral with citrus peel, white fruits and a dry, lightly grippy finish. A great introduction to orange wine.

By John Gruber WorkOS simplifies MCP authorization with a single API built on five OAuth standards. A list of various related news items and clips from this, and recent, weeks: Apple Newsroom, on Wednesday — “Apple Increases U.S. Commitment To $600 Billion, Announces American Manufacturing Program”: Apple today announced a new $100 billion commitment to America, a significant acceleration of its U.S. investment that now totals $600 billion over the next four years. Today’s announcement includes the ambitious new American Manufacturing Program (AMP), dedicated to bringing even more of Apple’s supply chain and advanced manufacturing to the U.S. Through AMP, Apple will increase its investment across America and incentivize global companies to manufacture even more critical components in the United States. Separately, also from Apple Newsroom Wednesday — “Apple and Corning Partner to Manufacture 100 Percent of iPhone and Apple Watch Cover Glass in Kentucky”: Apple and Corning today announced a major expansion of their long-standing partnership to make precision glass for Apple products. Apple is making a new $2.5 billion commitment to produce all of the cover glass for iPhone and Apple Watch in Corning’s Harrodsburg, Kentucky, manufacturing facility. This means that 100 percent of the cover glass on iPhone and Apple Watch units sold worldwide will be made in the U.S. for the first time. Corning is creating the world’s largest and most advanced smartphone glass production line at the Harrodsburg facility. Corning will now dedicate this entire facility to manufacturing for Apple, which will help increase Corning’s manufacturing and engineering workforce in Kentucky by 50 percent. From inside the Oval Office on Wednesday afternoon, a 3.5-minute video of Trump’s introductory remarks, then Tim Cook giving Trump a trophy of sorts, with an Apple-logo top made from glass produced at the Corning facility in Kentucky, and a base made from 24-karat gold (perhaps left over from Apple’s decade ago foray into $20,000 “Edition” Apple Watches?). This video is one of the most pathetic things I’ve ever witnessed, for everyone involved. (Note Cook’s awkward laughter when Trump, after claiming that “about $17 trillion is coming into the United States” thanks to the brilliance of his economic statecraft, quips “That’s even a lot of money for you”, looking at Cook.) From the same press event in the Oval Office, a 5-minute video of Cook’s benign but obsequious prepared remarks. Apple’s stock, as I type this after the close of markets on Friday, is up 11.6 percent for the week, and jumped over 5 percent immediately after Wednesday’s announcements. Tripp Mickle, reporting for The New York Times back on May 26, under the headline “Tech’s Trump Whisperer, Tim Cook, Goes Quiet as His Influence Fades”: In the run-up to President Trump’s recent trip to the Middle East, the White House encouraged chief executives and representatives of many U.S. companies to join him. Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, declined, said two people familiar with the decision. The choice appeared to irritate Mr. Trump. As he hopscotched from Saudi Arabia to the United Arab Emirates, Mr. Trump took a number of shots at Mr. Cook. During his speech in Riyadh, Mr. Trump paused to praise Jensen Huang, the chief executive of Nvidia, for traveling to the Middle East along with the White House delegation. Then he knocked Mr. Cook. “I mean, Tim Cook isn’t here but you are,” Mr. Trump said to Mr. Huang at an event attended by chief executives like Larry Fink of the asset manager BlackRock, Sam Altman of OpenAI, Jane Fraser of Citigroup and Lisa Su of the semiconductor company AMD. Later in Qatar, Mr. Trump said he “had a little problem with Tim Cook.” The president praised Apple’s investment in the United States, then said he had told Mr. Cook, “But now I hear you’re building all over India. I don’t want you building in India.” On Friday morning, Mr. Trump caught much of his own administration and Apple’s leadership off guard with a social media post threatening tariffs of 25 percent on iPhones made anywhere except the United States. The post thrust Apple back into the administration’s cross hairs a little over a month after Mr. Cook had lobbied and won an exemption from a 145 percent tariff on iPhones assembled in China and sold in the United States. April 2018: Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman met with Tim Cook in Cupertino, including a tour of Apple Park. From a Kif Leswing report for Business Insider regarding the tour: The young prince, often referred to as MBS, was on a charm offensive, according to The New York Times. His goal was to change the Western perspective of Saudi Arabia as a conservative country dependent on oil money where women are treated as second-class people. Instead, Prince Mohammed wants Americans to see Saudi Arabia as a modern country with extensive investments in growth markets like technology. October 2018: Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi dissident and public critic of the Saudi regime, was brutally assassinated — literally chopped to pieces — inside the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul. Within weeks, the CIA concluded that Mohammed bin Salman had ordered the assassination. Tim Cook has not met with MBS since. President Trump, at the US-Saudi Investment Forum in May — one stop among several on the Middle East tour, which, per point #6 above, Tim Cook declined to attend — was effusive in his praise and admiration for bin Salman. Per ABC News: President Donald Trump spent the bulk of what was billed as a “major foreign policy address” to outline his vision for the Middle East instead touting his domestic policies and heaping praise on Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman while speaking at the U.S.-Saudi Investment Forum on Tuesday. Four years after the U.S. intelligence community report was released that concluded that the crown prince approved the assassination of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi, Trump lauded the crown prince for his leadership and friendship. “He’s your greatest representative, greatest representative. And if I didn’t like him, I’d get out of here so fast. You know that, don’t you? He knows me well. I do — I like him a lot. I like him too much. That’s why we give so much, you know? Too much. I like you too much,” Trump said while speaking in Saudi Arabia. Trump, this week, at the White House event with Tim Cook, per CNBC: “We’re going to be putting a very large tariff on chips and semiconductors,” Trump said in the Oval Office on Wednesday afternoon. “But the good news for companies like Apple is if you’re building in the United States or have committed to build, without question, committed to build in the United States, there will be no charge. So in other words, we’ll be putting a tariff on of approximately 100% on chips and semiconductors. But if you’re building in the United States of America, there’s no charge.” [...] But specifics about the plan, such as how much U.S. manufacturing a company needs to do in order to qualify for the tariff exemption, were not immediately clear. There is, of course, no need to wait for “specifics about the plan”, which almost certainly won’t ever be put in writing. We all know how to qualify for an exemption — it’s up to the whims of Trump. Thumbs up, you’re exempt. Thumbs down, you pay. So, what to make of Cook’s obsequious praise for Trump and gifting of an Apple-branded gold trophy? Your take may well be that Cook is simply now a Trump supporter. Or, your take may be that eating a big shit sandwich like this, right in the Oval Office, is simply what Cook “has to do”. My take remains somewhere in the middle, but closer to the latter than the former. Did Cook have to do this? No. Could the announcement that Apple was accelerating its investment plans for US manufacturing from $500 billion to $600 billion simply have been made via a press release on Apple Newsroom, rather than a made-for-TV press event in the Oval Office? Yes.1 But Cook, and Apple, need to pick their battles. To me, what’s obvious is the power dynamic. We’re not used to considering Apple, a $3 trillion company, as subservient in any relationship. But the US federal government dwarfs even the biggest of companies, and Trump is wielding the powers of the executive branch and the bully pulpit of the presidency in unprecedented ways. Flagrantly illegal and unethical ways, but nonetheless, he’s wielding those powers. No company, no matter how big, can stand as a check or balance to that power. It’s not even a case of “kiss the ring and receive preferential treatment”. It’s more a case of “kiss his ass or else you’ll face punishment”. Trump, like a perverted Santa Claus, keeps only two lists: naughty and nice. Cook and Apple got a taste of that after Cook declined to participate in Trump’s Middle East tour, leading Trump to reflexively declare new tariffs on iPhones assembled in India. Trump offered another taste when he announced this week, with Tim Cook in the room, the supposed 100 percent tariffs on computer chips for companies who aren’t playing ball. (I say supposed because the TACO hypothesis, thus far, has panned out.) Faulting Cook for playing ball and kissing Trump’s ring (among other things) is like faulting a local business for paying into a protection racket — one in which the cops are complicit, and the whole scam exists at the behest of a crooked mayor. Moral rectitude can feel good, but not so much when the cops are burning your store to the ground. There is no authority to appeal to for help when the highest office in the country is running the protection racket. I don’t know what would happen to Apple if they simply refused to play ball with any of this at all. Targeted spiteful tariffs, bogus investigations by the Justice Department, personal vilification in MAGA media. Could Apple weather such a storm, financially, with its head held high? Probably. But to what effect? It wouldn’t change the game. The game is currently shamelessly corrupted. Did Cook’s Oval Office display of fealty and his grotesque golden gift make you feel something? Did it engender an emotional response? Grossed out, perhaps? A little sick? Angry? Offended? Me too. But did you feel good — reassured? proud? — when Cook skipped that Middle East Trump tour in May? You know, the one that ranged from Trump singing the praises of the murderous Mohammed bin Salman (“I like you too much”) to accepting as a gift (that he claims will wind up in the possession of his post-presidential “library”) a 747 luxury jet from Qatar. If you choose to believe that Tim Cook is weak, unethical, greedy, or even — despite his long-professed heroes — secretly a MAGA supporter, there’s likely nothing I can say to disabuse you of the notion. You can’t prove a negative. But I would argue that that line of cynicism is the easy way out. That you’re taking comfort in directing your ire at Cook, and the notion that if Cook had more backbone he’d refuse to play this game. It’s comforting to believe it’s him and his ilk, greedy selfish billionaires, not us as a collective whole. It is disturbing to think that the leader of a beloved, trusted, and widely believed-to-be-ethical company like Apple has succumbed to avarice. That Tim Cook feels no qualms about — or perhaps even delights in — participating in a quid-pro-quo-driven corrupt administration in which flattery, fealty, gifts, and barely-concealed bribes are rewarded. That the United States devolving into kleptocracy suits Tim Cook just fine, because Apple’s pockets are deep enough to pay the vig. But the alternative is more disturbing. What if Tim Cook is, in fact, strong, proud, and driven by a keen sense of moral and ethical clarity? Perhaps Cook declined Trump’s invitation to join his Middle East entourage in May only because he was otherwise busy. But I believe there are bridges he will not cross — and that trip, especially its implicit and explicit praise and sanctification of the Saudi regime in general, and MBS in particular, was one of them. The whole trip was grotesque, and made a mockery of traditional American values. US manufacturing, on the other hand, is a point of genuine alignment between Trump’s desires and Apple’s interests and ethics. Emphasizing that alignment in an Oval Office event, solid gold trophy in hand, is gross, yes, but not at all a corruption of anything Cook believes to be in the genuine interests of Apple or the nation. Consider the possibility that, far from being comfortable with his gift and obsequious ring-kissing this week, Cook was as discomfited by it as anyone. That he is keenly aware that trust and reputation are only accrued slowly, but are always at risk of being squandered quickly, and that this applies both to how he is perceived personally and how Apple is perceived as an institution — a pillar of American ingenuity and industry. His life’s work. And that despite all of that, Cook concluded that debasing himself, selling some shares of his own dignity, was the best course of action — for Apple, for Apple’s customers (and, yes, shareholders), and perhaps even for the country. That ruthless practicality is necessary merely to stay afloat in a sea of abject graft, extortion, and cronyism. That’s dark. That requires considering that the problem isn’t the greed of a few billionaires and executives who ought to resist burgeoning corruption, but that Trump and his sycophants in the Republican Party have already succeeded in corrupting the system. That the corruption isn’t happening, but happened. The United States isn’t heading for existential trouble. We’re in it — and a pathway out is not yet clear. That’s not to say all is forever lost, but that we are, in our current political moment, beyond the point where the game can be played successfully on the level. You can choose to play a crooked game straight, but you can’t win. Business is competition. A loser who played above reproach is still a loser. You need to choose your battles. US manufacturing is Cook’s choice. The White House has long been called the People’s House. The embarrassment of this week’s Oval Office bending of the knee isn’t Cook’s or Apple’s alone. It’s an embarrassment for our entire nation. It’s not him. It’s not them. It’s us. Also worth noting: Apple’s investment plan for US manufacturing is largely in line with their $430 billion plan four years ago at the outset of the Biden administration, and is likely what they’d be committing under a hypothetical Harris administration or second Biden term. Apple’s strategy hasn’t wavered on this front; only the fanfare has. ↩︎ Display Preferences Copyright © 2002–2025 The Daring Fireball Company LLC.

The Harvard Management Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of the university, has a $116 million position in BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust, a 13F form filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission shows. Not one to be left out, Brown University—which first bought exposure to Bitcoin in May—upped its position in BlackRock's ETF and now holds $13 million worth of shares, a similar filing shows. Neither Brown nor Harvard immediately responded to Decrypt's request for comment. The filings are the latest examples of traditional institutions seeking exposure to the biggest cryptocurrency by market cap. Crypto ETFs like BlackRock's Bitcoin Trust—which trades as IBIT—allow investors to buy exposure to the leading cryptocurrency without having to own and store the digital coin directly. BlackRock’s IBIT is the most successful crypto ETF: The fund has received more cash than any other crypto ETF and currently has $86.3 billion in assets under management. Other major institutions have bought exposure to Bitcoin, once an arcane and obscure asset, since the January 2024 approval of the ETFs. A flood of capital has entered the crypto space since the funds started trading, with investors previously too intimidated by things like storing digital coins in crypto wallets now able to easily buy a position. Pension funds and U.S. states have all bought exposure to Bitcoin via the ETFs over the past year, along with more traditional investments like tech stocks and other U.S. equities.

August 08, 2025 16:30 ET | Source: Faraday Future Faraday Future LOS ANGELES, Aug. 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faraday Future Intelligent Electric Inc. (NASDAQ: FFAI) (“Faraday Future” or the “Company”) today announced that it plans to hold a Special Meeting of Stockholders (the “EGM”) on September 19, to seek approval for proposals aimed at supporting the Company’s strategic initiatives and long-term growth. The Company urges all stockholders to vote FOR all proposals. Proposal Highlights： 1. Share Authorization ProposalApproval of an amendment to the Company’s Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended (the “Charter”) to increase the number of authorized shares of Common Stock by 65,225,672, from 167,245,313 to 232,470,985, representing a 39% increase, and increase the number of authorized shares of the Company’s Preferred Stock, by 5,031,000 shares, from 12,900,000 to 17,931,000, so that the total number of authorized shares, including Common Stock and Preferred Stock, will increase from 180,145,313 shares to 250,401,985 shares. The proposal does not affect the current number of outstanding shares but reflects the Company’s continued adherence to a prudent, disciplined, and relatively low-percentage new share issuance strategy. Having additional authorized shares of Class A Common Stock will help the Company meet its existing obligations including the recent $105 Million financing commitment and be well-positioned to pursue future opportunities, including capital raises, acquisitions, stock dividends or splits, stock issuances under employee benefit plans, and other proper corporate purposes. This increased share capacity is also critical to funding the Company’s ongoing operations and executing its business strategy and facilitate the rapid execution of the Second Chapter of the Bridge Strategy, in alignment with its long-term vision of becoming a leader in the AI-driven EV era and demonstrating the Company’s dedication to putting stockholders first. 2. Private Placement ProposalApproval of the issuance of shares of Class A Common Stock to holders of certain convertible notes and warrants in accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(d). This measure ensures compliance with regulatory requirements while enabling the Company to honor its obligations to holders of certain of the Company’s convertible notes and common warrants, which is crucial for the Company to obtain funds to support the production of vehicles in the future. 3. Name Change ProposalApproval of an amendment to the Company’s Charter to change the Company’s name from “Faraday Future Intelligent Electric Inc.” to “Faraday Future AI Electric Vehicle Inc.” The new name aligns with the Company’s vision to lead the intelligent electric vehicle (EV) industry and highlights its commitment to innovation in AI-driven solutions and smart transportation ecosystems. Additionally, the new name aligns with the Company’s new ticker symbol, FFAI, reinforcing a unified brand identity. 4. Amended 2021 Plan ProposalApproval of an amendment to the Company’s Amended and Restated 2021 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2021 Plan”) to increase the number of shares of Class A Common Stock available for issuance under the 2021 Plan by an additional 9,500,000 shares. The proposed amendment is intended to ensure the Company can continue offering long-term equity incentives as a competitive alternative to cash compensation. This change is critical to attracting, motivating, and retaining top talent, which is essential for executing our business strategy and driving long-term stockholder value. 5. Adjournment Proposal Approval of one or more adjournments of the Special Meeting by the Company from time to time to permit further solicitation of proxies, if necessary or appropriate, if sufficient votes are not represented at the Special Meeting to approve one or more Proposals at the time of such adjournment or if otherwise determined by the chairperson of the Special Meeting to be necessary or appropriate. Recent Key Business Progress with Continued Stockholder Support Powered by ongoing stockholders' backing, our Bridge Strategy has driven comprehensive progress, strengthening both operational and capital fundamentals: "Our Bridge Strategy continues to attract global users, investors, and partners. FF's dual improvements in operational and capital fundamentals are directly attributable to stockholders' long-standing support," YT Jia, Founder and Co-CEO of FF, said. "We're now in the final phase before the year-end rollout of the first FX Super One vehicle in the U.S. market, while simultaneously implementing a major upgrade to our Bridge Strategy that positions FF for accelerated growth. At this critical moment, we've submitted key proposals to advance our business. We urge stockholders to vote FOR all proposals – your decision will determine the company's future!"

Title: AI neo-colonialism: How Big Tech is strip-mining the Global South for data

By Dr. Mathew Maavak, who researches systems science, global risks, geopolitics, strategic foresight, governance and Artificial Intelligence By Dr. Mathew Maavak, who researches systems science, global risks, geopolitics, strategic foresight, governance and Artificial Intelligence The new colonial frontier isn’t restricted to mineral-rich Congo or oil-drenched Venezuela. It’s digital, invisible, and everywhere. From the shantytowns of Nairobi to the barrios of Manila, smartphones hum with the raw material of the 21st century: data, all sorts of data. And just like spices and slaves once sailed westward in imperial galleons, metadata now travels quietly to the cloud servers of Palo Alto and Shenzhen. This isn’t development, it is digital extraction. Welcome to the age of AI colonialism. Big Tech firms from the US, and to a lesser extent China, have turned the Global South into a massive open-pit mine for behavioral data. Under the pretense of “AI for Development,” they build infrastructure, donate connectivity, and sponsor pilot programs but the returns flow in only one direction. Voice samples collected in Ghana become training fodder for Western voice assistants. Facial data gathered in Nigerian policing trials end up fine-tuning surveillance software in San Francisco, where western models have had protracted problems in identifying and tracking darker-skinned individuals. Agricultural data scraped from Filipino farmers help power predictive analytics for agribusiness conglomerates that will hardly benefit the Philippines. This is not a partnership. This is colonial pillage dressed in TED Talk lingo. AI is marketed as a miracle equalizer that will help developing nations leapfrog into the future. We were told AI would bring precision agriculture, predictive healthcare, and smart urbanism, among numerous other utopian transformations, to even the most under-resourced regions. These Davos fantasies were regurgitated for nearly two decades. But where is the proof, the showcase project or evidence that even a fraction of those promises was delivered? The only real revolution happening is the outflow of data that were supposed to power these breakthroughs. Big Tech servers abroad now function like the colonial warehouses and banks of yore. Nor are intellectual properties of individuals and SMEs in the Developing World safe from this new brand of predation. Models, patents, ideas, and profits quietly migrate north while the Global South is left with nothing but pilot programs and PowerPoint decks. Worse still, these tools are increasingly used against the very populations providing the raw material, or should I say, raw data. In Kenya, facial recognition technology was introduced as a policing tool under the guise of modernization. In practice, it has disproportionately targeted political activists who, in turn, are also resorting to AI to level the political battlefield. Who ultimately benefits from this internecine clash? Isn’t this the latest incarnation of the old imperial “divide and conquer” dictum? In India, AI-driven fraud detection systems have misclassified thousands of rural poor, unjustly cutting them off from vital government benefits. Imported algorithmic governance – often designed without regard for local context or cultural nuance – compounds the problem. Ironically, while these systems penalize the most vulnerable, India has emerged as a global hub for sophisticated online scams. It is a digital paradox where the poor are relentlessly surveilled, while the real fraudsters flourish with impunity. Nothing exemplifies AI colonialism better than the biometric boom. Tech firms, often in partnership with NGOs or global financial institutions, are racing to digitize identities across the Global South. Fingerprint scans, iris recognition, voiceprint registration have all been justified as ways to “include the unbanked” or “streamline public services.” But these efforts rarely include meaningful consent or data protection frameworks. In many cases, biometric systems have been imposed without community consultation or independent oversight. One of the most egregious examples is Worldcoin, a cryptocurrency project that offered small payments in exchange for biometric iris scans. Its largest user base? Young people in low-income African nations like Kenya who served as a convenient population to experiment on, far from the regulatory spotlights of Brussels or Washington. (Note; Worldcoin was co-founded by Sam Altman, who is also the co-founder and CEO of OpenAI, which owns ChatGPT). Once collected, this data becomes part of opaque and often proprietary AI systems whose inner workings are unknowable to the very people they affect. Local regulators are usually outgunned, underfunded or more likely, politically compromised. As a result, entire populations are subjected to surveillance and scoring regimes that they neither understand nor control. The worst culprits in this saga are not Big Tech but local politicians and “technocrats” who sell out their nations at bargain basement prices, couched under the double-speak of “best practices” and UN institutional recommendations. Silicon Valley is the global epicenter of thenew East India Companies. These entities are vested with quasi-sovereign power and backed by vast capital reserves, lobbying muscle, and a veneer of corporate benevolence. Where the original East India Company extracted tea and textiles, today’s digital extractors siphon up location metadata, online behavior, biometric identifiers, and social graph mappings. Consider Meta’s “Free Basics” initiative, which offered zero-rated internet access in dozens of developing countries. What seemed like a humanitarian gesture was, in reality, an attempt to create a captive ecosystem – one where Facebook was the internet. It was banned in India in 2016 but continues in other countries, quietly conditioning the digital habits of hundreds of millions of users. An expanded Meta Connectivity is now used by an estimated 300 million people across many countries, including Indonesia, Pakistan, and the Philippines. Critics warn that these platforms could be exploited for surveillance, IP harvesting, and geopolitical intelligence – often without the knowledge or consent of local populations. No one really knows what is happening. Besides, these services are not entirely free either. Pakistani users of Meta’s tech philanthropy were allegedly charged $1.9 million per month. India, once hailed as a rising digital superpower, now serves as a showpiece for AI neo-colonialism. Its vast IT industry, once brimming with promise, is today little more than an outsourced arm of Western conglomerates. Here is a reality check: how many individuals outside India have even one Indian-made app on their phones? There was a brief window when Indian tech seemed poised to lead. In the late ’90s, a major US tech firm allegedly commissioned two parallel teams – one in Silicon Valley, the other in an Indian city – to build a next-generation operating system to challenge Microsoft. The Indian team delivered. The US team could not. Around the same time, Indian innovators like Sabeer Bhatia gave us Hotmail, which arguably accelerated the decline of the traditional postal system. For a brief moment, the digital future seemed multipolar. That was until Big Capital arrived. Rather than reward innovation, Big Tech consolidated. Rival platforms that didn’t serve the globalist surveillance machine were quietly buried. Competition was replaced with shareholder-sanctioned “coordination,” led by the likes of BlackRock and its predecessors. From that point on, Indian IT firms would be reduced from potential innovators to mere subcontractors. And who better to manage this global digital plantation than a new class of compliant Indian C-Suite executives? These are not the disruptors. They are the taskmasters of digital “kanganis,” running the same extractive labor models once perfected by the East India Company. The dream of an “Asian Century” powered by Indian software and Chinese hardware has curdled into a reality of Chinese software, Chinese hardware, and Chinese AI. Indian tech talent has been reduced to glorified middleware, at best. For all the online chest-thumping about Indian-origin CEOs in the US, where is India’s own Jensen Huang? Where is the Indian-founded equivalent of NVIDIA, OpenAI, or even Palantir? There isn’t one. India produces engineers by the millions but owns almost none of the gilt-edged platforms. It trains the talent, but not the trillion-dollar tech. The colony codes and the empire profits. A similar theme is being played out in the US Ivy League system. But is the tide turning? Nigeria has applied brakes on foreign-backed digital ID programs. Kenya has suspended iris-scanning initiatives after massive backlash. A growing chorus of activists, lawyers, and technologists are calling for data sovereignty: the idea that countries should have the same rights over their data that they claim over oil, water, and land. A few pioneering efforts have emerged. In Brazil, the General Data Protection Law has begun to shape public discourse. In South Africa, local AI research groups are working on open, transparent models rooted in African languages and cultural norms. The African Union has even begun early-stage deliberations on a continental data governance framework. But it is an uphill fight. Western governments, in tandem with corporate lobbyists, continue to push for “data liberalization” which is nothing but a euphemism for open access-mediated exploitation. Aid packages, development grants, and tech investments are increasingly tied to these demands. It echoes the structural adjustment programs of the 1980s, where loans came with strings that hollowed out national control. Only now, the strings are coded in algorithms. The Global South needs a coordinated pushback against Silicon Valley’s digital hegemony. This would involve not just resisting predatory data practices but investment in alternative infrastructures such as sovereign cloud storage, ethical AI standards, community-owned data cooperatives, and open-source platforms. This is how a new digital non-alignment paradigm can be achieved. The Global South has been colonized before. But data, unlike oil or sugar, is invisible, infinitely replicable, and easily stolen. That makes the fight harder but also more urgent. In this new age of algorithmic empires, control over information isn’t just about profit, it is about power, freedom, and the right to define your own future.

Title: Trump Signs Executive Order to Allow Crypto into 401(k)

Time Published: 2025-08-08T19:48:36Z
Full Content:
US President Donald Trump has signed a new executive order into effect that will allow American 401(ks) to invest in digital assets and related financial instruments. This could be a massive move for the entire digital currency market, as 401(k)s, also known as retirement funds, collectively hold a massive $6.12 trillion in assets and could invest significantly in them. However, the new presidential proclamation isn’t crypto-specific but a massive overhaul of retirement plan options available to American residents. It includes private equity, real estate, and other alternative investments as well. The move has opened the way for asset managers to tap into trillions of dollars worth of potential investments. According to the wording of the executive order: “My Administration will relieve the regulatory burdens and litigation risk that impede American workers’ retirement accounts from achieving the competitive returns and asset diversification necessary to secure a dignified, comfortable retirement”. The document then tasks the Labor Secretary and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to implement this directive and make it easier for Americans to invest in these disruptive assets. It also asked federal agencies to ensure clarity in the current rules to facilitate the ownership of these assets, but stopped short of asking for specific actions in this regard. Executive orders are one of the primary tools at the disposal of the President’s office in the USA. However, they can be challenged in courts, and the latter have a long precedent of delaying and even striking down orders that don’t line up with the constitution or established precedents. The US pensions market is set to reach a whopping $10 trillion by 2030 with an annual CGR of 9%. The Trump executive order is a major deal for crypto investors in the USA, as previously, federal agencies and executive authority had heavily discouraged crypto in retirement accounts. The move was particularly welcomed by elite asset managers like BlackRock, which was reportedly behind the lobbying of this particular use of presidential power by President Trump. Users on X (formerly Twitter) also chipped in immediately, with one analyst commenting: According to Blackrock’s senior retirement asset manager, Jaime Magyera: “Expanding access to investments long out of reach will help ensure millions of Americans build stronger, more diversified portfolios designed to increase savings and address the practical considerations of DC plan fiduciaries,” The move follows years of lobbying by crypto users and asset managers to improve the process of including crypto in 401(ks). It remains to be seen just how much of a major impact it will have on Bitcoin’s price index, which is currently trading around the $117,000 valuation.

With Ethereum surpassing $4,000, prediction platforms see a bullish sentiment, forecasting potential price targets up to $60,000. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Ethereum (ETH) surged past the $4,000 mark on Aug. 8, hitting its highest level this year after a sustained market rally that saw it gain nearly 50% in the past month. Data from CryptoSlate shows the asset peaked at $4,047 during US trading hours. Notably, the last time ETH traded above $4,000 was in December 2024, when optimism around Donald Trump’s election victory fueled a wave of pro-crypto sentiment in the US. Meanwhile, CoinGlass data reveals the latest rally caught bearish traders off guard. Short positions against ETH suffered losses totaling $134 million in the past 24 hours as prices defied expectations. Ethereum’s breakout comes amid a surge in institutional interest in the digital asset for their treasury reserves. Over the past month, major firms such as SharpLink and BitMine have accumulated significant ETH holdings and announced multi-billion-dollar purchase plans. According to Strategic ETH Reserve data, these entities collectively hold over 3 million ETH—about 2.5% of the total supply—valued at more than $12 billion. BitMine leads with 833,100 ETH, worth approximately $5.2 billion. Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum, has expressed a cautious optimism regarding the increasing corporate interest in ETH. While he welcomed the adoption, Buterin cautioned firms against overleveraging their ETH holdings. According to Buterin: “If you woke me up 3 years from now and told me that treasuries led to the downfall of ETH… my guess would be that they turned into an overleveraged game.” In addition to these firms, the Ethereum network has also seen a surge in adoption via exchange-traded funds (ETFs), with a record $5 billion in inflows recorded in July. According to SoSo Value data, the trend has continued into the new month, with the nine funds registering just two days of outflows in August compared to four days of outflows experienced by their Bitcoin counterparts. Additionally, traditional financial powerhouses like BlackRock and Robinhood have expanded their activities around Ethereum, focusing on real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. Looking ahead, market optimism continues to rise along with expectations of Ethereum’s continued price growth. Crypto bettors on Polymarket, the leading decentralized prediction platform, believe there is a 60% chance that ETH will exceed $5,000 by the end of the year. Meanwhile, 36% of traders believe it could reach $6,000, and 24% predict a rise to $7,000. Notably, BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes is more bullish about Ethereum’s price hitting $10,000 by the end of the year. Meanwhile, BitMine’s projections suggest a much higher potential, estimating ETH’s implied price at $60,000. At the time of press 8:22 pm UTC on Aug. 8, 2025, Ethereum is ranked #2 by market cap and the price is up 5.63% over the past 24 hours. Ethereum has a market capitalization of $488.37 billion with a 24-hour trading volume of $46.05 billion.

(Bloomberg) -- The heavy hitters of private credit have been waiting for this moment for years. Major lenders, which often cater to companies with dented credit, talk endlessly about the opportunities in investment-grade debt and in financing the breakneck growth of artificial intelligence. They’ve done smaller deals, but this week they caught the biggest fish yet: a $29 billion financing package for Meta Platforms Inc.’s massive data center in Louisiana. That transaction, led by Pacific Investment Management Co. and Blue Owl Capital Inc., hits all the high notes: It’s a top-notch business in a hot sector. It disrupts the usual route that companies like Meta travel to get money from investors through banks. And, it’s huge. “Private credit has been itching to get into this space,” said John Medina, senior vice president on the global project and infrastructure finance team at Moody’s Ratings. “This deal is one of the first of its kind for private credit and if it is successful, we would expect to see more.” The biggest technology companies are in an AI arms race now, and they need cash to win. Elon Musk’s xAI Corp. recently told investors it plans to spend $18 billion on data centers, and is looking at raising debt backed by projects rather than at the corporate level. Others including Amazon.com Inc. and OpenAI Inc. are pursuing their own sites across the US. Morgan Stanley estimates that capital expenditures on AI could exceed $3 trillion in the next three years. For Meta, Pimco is planning to arrange $26 billion in debt and Blue Owl is providing $3 billion in equity. The debt portion is likely to be issued in the form of investment-grade bonds backed by the data center’s assets, people familiar with the matter said, adding that the final structure is still in flux. The bidding war for the financing lasted months. It was competitive because private credit firms have been all-but-begging for access to the investment-grade debt world that banks dominate. Other private credit firms that grappled for the top spot include Apollo Global Management Inc. and KKR & Co., which made it to the final round, as well as Brookfield Asset Management Ltd., Blackstone Inc. and Ares Management Corp., said the people, who were not authorized to speak publicly. Morgan Stanley advised Meta on the deal but isn’t leading the financing. It is the largest funding package related to a specific AI data center by a mile, with others involving xAI Corp. or Coreweave Inc. well below $10 billion. Microsoft Inc., BlackRock Inc. and the United Arab Emirates’ MGX investment vehicle are teaming up to raise $30 billion of private equity that can be leveraged to $100 billion, with Nvidia Corp. and xAI also joining in, but that money is for a series of data warehouses and energy infrastructure rather than an individual project. The most recent debt deal of any kind that’s even near the size of Meta’s was a $26 billion bond sale to support Mars Inc.’s purchase of rival food-maker Kellanova in March. A group of banks put together the financing, which was funneled through to their typical investors in the syndicated market. Dry Powder Private credit firms have about $450 billion of dry powder to invest, according to Preqin data, and are clamoring for this kind of business. The corporate acquisitions that often fuel private credit deals are practically at a standstill. And these firms aspire to more fully become rivals to traditional Wall Street banks — handling everything from advising companies to structuring their debt to providing some of it themselves. Expanding further into investment-grade deals could help make private credit a $40 trillion market, according to an estimate from Apollo. “This ecosystem of private investment-grade is a massive market with a huge tailwind,” Michael Zawadzki, the global chief investment officer at Blackstone’s credit and insurance unit, said last year. Representatives for Apollo, Meta, Pimco, Blue Owl, Brookfield, Blackstone, Ares and Morgan Stanley declined to comment. Those for KKR and xAI didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. KKR and Energy Capital Partners last year agreed to a $50 billion partnership to accelerate the development of infrastructure for artificial intelligence. Blue Owl CEO Marc Lipschultz has compared the AI craze to the Gold Rush: though lenders aren’t out there digging for treasure, they can provide the “picks and shovels” that technology firms need. “In this case, it takes the modern version, the data centers,” he said during a conference call on July 31. “And we are the best placed firm to help develop and to help fund those data centers.” --With assistance from Laura Benitez and Kurt Wagner.

Title: Ken Paxton Took Victory Lap Suing Woke ‘Cartel’ He Quietly Invests Fortune In

Time Published: 2025-08-08T16:37:26Z

Republican Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton is taking a victory lap for spearheading a multi-state lawsuit taking on the world’s largest asset managers, but is quietly sitting upon thousands of shares of mutual funds managed by one of the targets of his complaint, according to recent financial disclosures. Paxton cheered a Texas judge’s ruling on Aug. 1 denying a petition from the investment juggernauts — BlackRock, State Street and Vanguard — to dismiss a lawsuit brought by the attorney general and ten other Republican states. Though Paxton had then cast Vanguard as part of an “investment cartel” who works to “squeeze more money out of everyday Americans,” his holdings in five Vanguard mutual funds have largely flown under the radar. (RELATED: Trump Admin Backs Red States’ Antitrust Suit Against Financial Titans To ‘Protect Coal’) “I just secured a major win against Blackrock, Vanguard, and State Street,” Paxton wrote in an Aug. 1 post to the social media platform X — after a judge green-lit his antitrust lawsuit, arguing the money managers illegally conspired to slash coal production under the guise of a left-wing climate agenda. “These financial corporations created an investment cartel to illegally control national energy markets, and today’s victory represents an important step in holding them accountable.” Paxton is running to unseat Republican Texas Sen. John Cornyn in a primary contest that is shaping up to be one of the most brutal races of the midterms. Though Paxton has taken an early lead in polling, Cornyn — with the backing of Senate Republicans’ campaign arm and several outside spending groups — is mounting a concerted effort to close the gap. President Donald Trump, who said in April that he likes both candidates, has not yet issued an endorsement. The attorney general submitted a personal financial disclosure for his Senate run on June 16 — reporting thousands of shares in six Vanguard mutual funds valued between $1.6 million and $6.25 million. The amounts on financial disclosure forms are reported in ranges making Paxton’s net worth derived from the Vanguard shares difficult to pin down. Cornyn’s backers are criticizing Paxton’s investment holdings in Vanguard funds, noting the attorney general has repeatedly slammed the investment firm for allegedly bleeding Texans’ pocketbooks dry by illegally conspiring to drive up energy prices. “The fact that Paxton profits off the very practices he condemns shows he’s more interested in personal gain over principled leadership,” pro-Cornyn super PAC Texans for a Conservative Majority executive director Aaron Whitehead told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “If he truly believes this firm is hurting Texans why is he investing his personal money with them?” WASHINGTON, DC – AUGUST 01: Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-AL) (L) and Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX) speak in the hallway between votes at the U.S. Capitol on August 01, 2025 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) “You can always count on Crooked Ken Paxton to act unethically, dishonestly and selfishly, as he has done here. Texans can’t trust Ken Paxton, something he proves on a daily basis,” Cornyn campaign senior adviser Matt Mackowiak told the DCNF. Paxton’s investments in Vanguard, a pioneer of ultra-low cost investing, are a mixed bag of passively managed index funds and actively managed portfolios. He reported holding between 3,100 and 12,495 shares spread across five Vanguard mutual funds, according to a financial statement filed with the Texas Ethics Commission in June for the 2024 calendar year. Paxton has invested between $1 million and $5 million in Vanguard’s Institutional Index Fund (VIIIX), representing the largest investment holding on his Senate financial disclosure form. The low-cost index fund is passively managed by the firm and tracks the performance of the S&P 500 index, which seeks to mirror the performance of the nation’s largest stocks. The attorney general has also invested between $100,000 and $250,000 in Vanguard’s Primecap Fund (VPMCX), an actively managed “large-growth” fund offered by the firm, which touts outperforming the S&P 500 by an average of 2% annually. An additional Vanguard fund listed on Paxton’s disclosure is held by his wife, Texas State Senator Angela Paxton. She has invested between $50,000 and $100,000 in a Vanguard index fund that matches the performance of the overall stock market, according to Paxton’s Senate financial disclosure forms. Angela Paxton filed for divorce in July after 38 years of marriage, citing “biblical grounds.” Spokespersons for Paxton did not respond to the DCNF’s multiple requests for comment. “I will continue fighting to protect Texas and defend America’s energy independence from this unlawful conspiracy,” Paxton said regarding his lawsuit against Vanguard and other asset managers on Aug 1.

Title: XRP gains legal clarity in US after Ripple settles SEC case
URL: https://coinjournal.net/news/xrp-gains-legal-clarity-in-us-after-ripple-settles-sec-case/
Time Published: 2025-08-08T16:18:58Z

Ripple’s multi-year legal battle with the US Securities and Exchange Commission reached a decisive conclusion this week, triggering a sharp rally in XRP’s price and trading volume. The settlement confirmed that Ripple’s past programmatic and institutional sales of XRP were lawful, removing a major source of uncertainty that had weighed on the token since the lawsuit began. Within hours of the news, XRP surged 5.21% to $3.22, while trading volume climbed 164.43%, signalling renewed confidence from both retail and institutional traders. Analysts say the ruling could reshape market perceptions of XRP and potentially pave the way for future institutional products tied to the asset. Pro-XRP lawyer Bill Morgan announced that the legal dispute over Ripple’s previous programmatic and institutional XRP sales has been resolved with the SEC. The clarification confirms that these sales were compliant under US law, establishing that XRP itself is not a security. This development follows years of litigation that placed XRP under intense regulatory scrutiny, with Ripple and its community consistently challenging the SEC’s stance. The resolution has been widely interpreted as a significant turning point for the asset, particularly in the United States market. Analysts note that the combination of legal clarity and increased liquidity could drive more institutional participation in the months ahead. The latest ruling has bolstered expectations that large financial institutions may reconsider their stance on XRP. Some market commentators have even suggested that asset management giant BlackRock could explore an XRP exchange-traded fund, a move that would broaden access to the token for mainstream investors. While no official ETF filing has been made, industry experts believe XRP’s regulatory clarity gives it a competitive advantage over other digital assets still facing classification uncertainty. This could help position XRP as a viable option for both cross-border payment solutions and investment products. The settlement has reignited debates between the XRP and Bitcoin communities. Bitcoin-only advocates have continued to brand altcoins as securities, with MicroStrategy chairman Michael Saylor repeatedly asserting that only Bitcoin qualifies as a commodity. Morgan pushed back against these claims, highlighting XRP’s performance since its launch, which he calculated as exceeding 50,000% growth. He also responded to recent criticism from Bitcoin maximalists such as Adam Livingston, who alleged that Ripple could use banks to offload XRP onto retail investors. Traders are now monitoring whether XRP can sustain its upward momentum. The recent surge, combined with the removal of legal uncertainty, has given the asset a stronger market position. However, the cryptocurrency landscape remains highly competitive, and community sentiment continues to influence market moves. If institutional interest materialises, analysts expect XRP could see further demand growth, especially if new investment products are introduced. The ruling may also spark fresh regulatory conversations around the status of other digital assets, potentially influencing the broader crypto market.

August 08, 2025 11:37 ET | Source: Tevogen Bio Inc Tevogen Bio Inc WARREN, N.J., Aug. 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Tevogen (“Tevogen Bio Holdings Inc.” or “Company”) (Nasdaq: TVGN), today announced an update on institutional ownership of the Company’s outstanding common stock, as reported by institutional investment managers on Form 13F filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). As reported on March 31, 2025, institutional ownership of Tevogen common stock increased by 60% compared to the reported amount on December 31, 2024. The largest contributors to this growth were Vanguard and BlackRock, which together increased their holdings by 151%.

Title: On Independence Day, Foreign Agribusiness Will Be Told Get Out, “Quit India!”

Editor Solutions Colin Todhunter, OffGuardian On 15 August, India will celebrate its Independence Day. There will be the usual celebratory flag-waving and flypasts in Delhi along with sound bites about ‘the world’s biggest democracy’. But what has ‘independence’ come to mean? Placing an X on a ballot paper every now and then does not constitute democracy. If people are misinformed, misled and manipulated to think and act in a certain way, while backroom deals are carried out without their knowledge, then what value ‘democracy’? Then there is no freedom, no self-determination. Someone else is determining the agenda. The Quit India Movement was launched by Mahatma Gandhi and the Indian National Congress on 8 August 1942, demanding the immediate end of British rule in India. It inspired a mass civil disobedience campaign featuring strikes, demonstrations and sabotage, despite the British arresting Gandhi and many Congress leaders immediately after the movement’s start. The movement saw remarkable nationwide participation—including women, students, workers and peasants. Although it was violently suppressed by the colonial authorities, it galvanised the struggle for independence. The Quit India Movement significantly weakened British authority, promoted unity among diverse groups and set the stage for India’s eventual independence. Now, in 2025, the spirit of the Quit India Movement is being explicitly invoked by today’s farmer protests to inspire unity, resilience and a nationwide call to action. The Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM)—a coalition of 40-plus farmers’ unions across India—is at the forefront of a continuing struggle against government policies that are eroding rural livelihoods, national sovereignty and federal governance. Their concerns centre on an emerging authoritarian central government controlled by corporate interests and international finance capital, which threatens to subordinate the role of India’s states and dismantle vital protections for farmers and rural communities. SKM, alongside allied organisations such as the All India Kisan Sabha (AIKS), argues that the Union Government’s push for agricultural reforms under slogans like ‘One Nation, One Market’ jeopardises the constitutional federal structure. These reforms—including the draft National Policy Framework on Agriculture Marketing (NPFAM)—seek to unify India’s disparate agricultural marketing systems into a centralised, corporatised national market. According to the SKM, this transformation will severely diminishe the decision-making power of state governments over agriculture, land, industry and markets—domains constitutionally assigned to them. The NPFAM draft envisions a rescaling of agricultural marketing, replacing state-regulated wholesale markets (mandis) and rural haats with private, corporate-controlled entities integrated via Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) and blockchain technologies. Under this model, powerful private corporations, including conglomerates like Adani, Ambani, Tata, Cargill, Pepsi, Walmart, Bayer and Amazon, would engage directly with farmers, bypassing traditional state-regulated market structures. The consolidation of storage facilities and marketing channels under corporate control raises fears of price manipulation and diminishes farmers’ negotiating power. This change will essentially fundamentally restructure India’s agri-food sector and is aimed at integrating it deeply into global supply chains controlled by agribusiness and international finance capital. This is little more than a neocolonial strategy that would hand over India’s food security and agricultural governance to transnational corporations. In 2025, farmers are still protesting. The roots of the protests can be traced back to the three farm laws introduced and subsequently repealed in late 2021 following widespread protests. The SKM and the AIKS warn that the NPFAM is effectively a rebranded return of those laws, seeking to achieve their objectives through new policy frameworks. Key elements of the NPFAM echo the earlier laws’ intent to deregulate markets, permit private agribusiness entry and promote contract farming under conditions favourable to corporate interests. The absence of legislative guarantees for a legal Minimum Support Price (MSP) for agricultural produce and minimum wages for agricultural workers remains a still-unaddressed primary concern, as is the lack of accountability mechanisms to regulate corporate practices. Farmers face the prospect of becoming mere producers of raw materials for corporate supply chains, with prices dictated by powerful processing industries and exporters. The AIKS stresses that central government proposals, including deepening financialisation via futures and options markets, will enable global corporations and financial firms to assert dominance over the food industry, intensifying farmers’ economic vulnerabilities. The critique extends to dismantling of India’s longstanding food security frameworks: Facilitating corporate interests, the government seeks the withdrawal of state involvement in these key institutions, exposing India to volatile international markets controlled by global agribusiness, thereby undermining food sovereignty and rural welfare. In response to this proposed neoliberal shock therapy, the SKM has launched a series of coordinated protests to press their demands and safeguard farmers’ rights. On ‘Quit India” Day on 13 August, symbolically invoking the historic Quit India Movement, farmers nationwide will conduct vehicle and tractor parades, public demonstrations and the burning of effigies representing Donald Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. This protest specifically targets proposed Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) — particularly with the US — fearing they will exacerbate corporate dominance and market flooding with (GMO) cheap imports. The date, 13 August, comes two days before Independence Day celebrations. Something that may appear increasingly hollow as time marches on and we see the recolonisation of India’s economy by foreign interests. From 15 August, the campaign will include public hearings, grassroots mobilisation and awareness drives culminating in a large-scale worker-farmer protest action in Delhi and various state capitals on 26 November, marking five years since the historic farmers’ protests at Delhi’s borders. The movement’s core demands include a constitutionally or legally enforced MSP aligned with recommendations from the Swaminathan Commission, ensuring farmers receive at least 50% above the cost of production, loan waivers and financial relief tailored for farmers. Farmers also want the withdrawal of bans on using 10-year-old tractors in the National Capital Region (NCR), the restoration of fertiliser subsidies, regulation of spurious agricultural inputs. Stronger state infrastructure to maintain food security is called for along with support for small-scale producers and meaningful dialogue involving farmer organisations and state governments. Many of the key demands are long standing, but official responses to the protests and farmers’ demands have sometimes involved tear gas, water cannons and other harsh measures, reflecting attempts to suppress dissent and reassure international investors of a stable climate for foreign direct investment. In late 2021, SKM leader Rakesh Tikait noted that around 750 protesters had died in the prolonged struggle. Various officials have been recorded endorsing harsh crackdowns on demonstrators, further fuelling resentment and mistrust. This marks a broader trend of state suppression intended to clear the path for a corporate-financial takeover of the agricultural domain. The SKM and the AIKS protests and demands are well-founded. In India, as elsewhere, we are seeing the erosion of traditional diets and farming practices, resulting in an increasing reliance on ultra-processed foods and global corporate supply chains. Moreover, underinvestment in rural infrastructure and agriculture over decades has been deliberate, portraying Indian farming as backward and ripe for ‘modernisation’ that privileges corporate profit over food sovereignty. The commodification and financialisation of food and agricultural land will serve to further embed corporate influence at all levels, from seed to store (or, increasingly, e-commerce platform), paralleling a global pattern of food insecurity and corporate dominance. This corporate hijack is not unique to India. In late 2024, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer met with Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, and expressed enthusiasm for partnering with the global investment firm. Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds, in a letter, warmly welcomed this collaboration, stating that Labour looks forward to working with BlackRock to “change the face of our UK”. But what kind of “change” is being envisioned? It appears to involve making life increasingly difficult for farmers, especially through inheritance tax policies designed to push them off their land. This would pave the way for BlackRock to acquire farmland that is treated simply as an ‘asset class’, leading to industrial-scale agriculture and subsidy-driven green investments that could see vast expanses of countryside covered by solar panels. Given BlackRock’s global ambitions, Larry Fink is likely eager to replicate this strategy in India, especially as the country’s government advances development of a land market catering to international finance interests. India stands at a crossroads. The 2025 protest campaign reflects deeper battles over food sovereignty, federalism, rural livelihoods and the democratic rights of citizens. The struggle is not merely against specific trade deals or policies but against an overarching neoliberal agenda that threatens to fully disempower farmers and reshape India’s agricultural landscape to suit global capital at the expense of millions.

Bitcoin and crypto have rocketed higher this week, climbing as the market bounces back to $4 trillion from a sell-off that sparked fears of a crash. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price hit an all-time high of $123,000 per bitcoin last month, with traders betting the world’s largest asset manager BlackRock could be about to blow up up the market. Now, as legendary billionaire Ray Dalio issues a shock crypto recommendation, analysts with JPMorgan have flipped to predict the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in September—setting up a situation “eerily similar” to bitcoin’s 2024 second half price surge. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run "For [Fed chair Jerome] Powell, the risk management considerations at the next meeting may go beyond balancing employment and inflation risks," JPMorgan analyst Michael Feroli wrote in a note to clients seen by Reuters. JPMorgan predicts the Fed will cut interest rates by 25 basis points at its September meeting, pointing to labour market growth stalling and U.S. president Donald Trump’s nomination of the dovish chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, Stephen Miran, to a temporary seat on the Fed board, replacing outgoing governor Adriana Kugler. Powell has come under massive pressure from Trump this year, whose attacks over interest rates have raised the possibility that the era of Fed independence could be coming to an end. "In the off chance Miran is governor by the time of the next meeting, that could imply three dissents. That’s a lot of dissents," Feroli said, adding that if the jobs market continues to weaken it could justify a larger cut of 50 basis points. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free newsletter for the crypto-curious CME’s Fed Watch tool is now showing the market is pricing in an around 90% chance of an interest rate cut in September, creating a situation that mirrors the 2024 September rate cut that took market off-guard and spurred the bitcoin price to a record-breaking rally. "Last year’s August growth scare spurred the Fed into a ‘catch-up rate cut rush’ from September to December 2024, doubling bitcoin’s price in the process," Presto Research’s Peter Chung and Min Jung wrote in a note this week. “The current setup feels eerily similar.”

Title: XRP ETF odds surge to 80% after SEC-Ripple legal settlement

Analysts are split on whether BlackRock will file for spot XRP ETF. Analysts are split on whether BlackRock will file for a spot XRP ETF. But the latest regulatory update could be a positive catalyst for it to make the move, per Nate Geraci. BlackRock may apply for a spot Ripple[XRP] ETF after the U.S SEC and Ripple Labs ended their appeals. This was a bold projection by Nate Geraci of ETF Institute, adding that, “Yes, I think BlackRock was waiting to see this before filing for iShares XRP ETF…” He said that it would make ‘zero sense’ for the firm not to explore beyond Bitcoin [BTC] and Ethereum [ETH]. If it sticks to only BTC and ETH, then it would mean that only the two assets have value, Geraci wrote. As of press time, the asset manager had not applied for both XRP and Solana [SOL] ETFs. This made it the only potential issuer with BTC and ETH ETF offerings that was yet to make that move. Last year, Samara Cohen, CIO at BlackRock, noted that institutional investors were only focused on BTC and ETH. Hence, at that time, she added that they may not apply for other crypto ETFs in the near term. However, Geraci believes that BlackRock could file for SOL and XRP ETFs before the October approval deadline. For his part, Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas opined that the firm may just stick to the two top crypto assets, citing ‘diminished returns’ beyond ETH. Source: X Meanwhile, the approval odds for spot XRP ETF surged to nearly 80% after the SEC and Ripple Labs opted to end their appeals. Source: Polymarket Interestingly, the chances had dropped to 66% on the 7th of August. This followed revelations of alleged blockage of crypto ETFs by Democrat SEC Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw. But Balchunas noted that the commissioner was ‘outnumbered’ and could not prevent the products from going live, maintaining 95% of approval. “She’s outnumbered = we haven’t changed our odds, still at 95%.” On the market front, over $6 billion XRP has been offloaded in the past few days, flipping whale demand to negative. While this was a threat to the $3 support, the latest update on the dismissal of the SEC and Ripple Labs appeals triggered an 11% upswing to $3.3. However, Options traders were still heavily hedging against further downside risks despite the relief rally. Per Laevitas’ data, there was a premium for short-dated put options (bearish bets). Also, the 25 Delta Skew turned negative and dropped across the 1-day, 1-week, and 3-month tenors, illustrating weakening sentiment. Source: Laevitas Notably, traders bought over 1.8 billion XRP at each of the $2.70–$2.80 and $2.40–$2.50 zones, reinforcing these levels as key support areas. These zones now serve as potential floors in the event of a short-term pullback.

Mike Novogratz, chief executive of Galaxy Digital, told CNBC that a new executive order from US President Donald Trump could make it easier for retirement plans to include cryptocurrencies. According to reports, the order asks the Labor Department to review ERISA rules so alternatives such as crypto, private equity, and real estate can be offered inside 401(k) plans. That’s a policy signal that could matter to many savers, but it will not instantly change how plans operate. Based on reports, Americans hold about $8.7 trillion in 401(k) assets, so even small allocations would add up. Novogratz said that if companies like Fidelity, BlackRock or T. Rowe Price package crypto in retirement-friendly vehicles, mainstream access would increase. That could let ordinary savers get exposure through tax-advantaged accounts they already use. Plan sponsors and record-keepers remain subject to ERISA responsibilities and questions of duty of care. Those responsibilities mandate fiduciaries to act in a prudent way for participants, and introducing volatile assets creates genuine legal and compliance concerns. Thus, though the executive order reflects a change, regulators and plan providers must sort through operational realities before numerous retirement accounts hold significant crypto positions. Plan administrators will need custody solutions, audit trails, and low-cost product structures to make crypto fit with defined contribution plans. Many crypto vehicles carry lockups or higher fees, and that clashes with how 401(k) menus are usually set up. Litigation risk also remains: a sharp drop in value could lead to scrutiny from participants or courts. Regulators will likely balance investor protection against widening access, and asset managers will balance demand with legal caution. Market moves show the headline effect in action. Based on reports, Bitcoin traded at $116,500, up 3.0% in the past day, while Ethereum traded at $3,810, a 6% rise in the same timeframe. Novogratz has pointed to institutional products such as BlackRock’s Bitcoin Trust as evidence of growing demand. Those products help create familiar entry points for big money and retail investors alike. Don’t expect an instant tidal wave. Product teams at major managers will likely pilot custody and compliance setups before offering broad access. Plan sponsors may start with small, optional allocations or specialized windows rather than adding crypto to default funds. Small percentages across many accounts could still add up to large dollar flows if given time. In short, based on reports and Novogratz’s remarks, the executive order is a major political signal that could encourage more retirement capital toward crypto over time after Trump gives the EO its final seal of approval.

Title: Ripple and SEC settle, sparking XRP’s 10% rally and BlackRock ETF speculation

The legal certainty from Ripple's SEC settlement sparks speculation of a potential BlackRock XRP ETF project. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Ripple and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have agreed to formally end their appeals in the high-profile lawsuit that has dragged on for nearly four years. In a joint filing on Aug. 7, both parties confirmed they will withdraw their appeals following a Commission vote. Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer, Stuart Alderoty, said the agreement marks the close of a dispute that began in December 2020. Under the settlement terms, XRP will not be classified as a security, and each side will cover its own legal costs. This outcome is seen as a major win for Ripple, placing it alongside other crypto firms like Coinbase that have resolved conflicts with the SEC. Following the news, the XRP token price jumped by more than 10% to $3.33 as of press time, according to CryptoSlate’s data. The settlement has fueled speculation about a potential spot XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) from BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager. The firm already issues leading ETF products tied to Bitcoin and Ethereum. Nate Geraci, president of NovaDius Wealth, suggested BlackRock may have been waiting for legal clarity before considering an XRP product under its iShares brand. He argued that ignoring assets beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum could imply that no other cryptocurrencies have long-term value. However, he stressed that his views are speculative, saying: “I’ll own it if I’m wrong.” Meanwhile, not everyone shares Geraci’s optimistic outlook about a potential BlackRock XRP ETF. Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas expressed skepticism, saying he believes BlackRock is content with its two existing crypto ETFs. He cited the “law of diminishing returns” for adding more products, though he admitted his opinion was based more on intuition than concrete evidence. Despite his doubts about BlackRock pursuing an XRP ETF, Balchunas remains optimistic about the broader regulatory environment. He estimated a 95% chance of an XRP ETF receiving approval before the end of the year. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

Title: ‘Disaster in the Making’: Trump to Open 401(k)s to Crypto, Private Equity Vultures

Yves here. Private equity has been trying for many years to get their products sold to retail investors. Trump has greatly lowered the bar with his executive order. However (and I do not want to sound like a Pollyanna) but if the private equity part was as easy as a Presidential stroke of a pen, it would have happened already. Selling a financial product to retail investors requires considerably more financial reporting and compliance. That involves another layer of fees and costs when private equity is already pulling out so much in fees and costs as to make private equity less attractive on a risk-return basis than stocks. That is not to say that the new SEC chair won’t try to bend the rules. See our May post: New SEC Chief on Board with Letting Retail Chumps Invest in Private Equity Even as Pros Like Kuwait Sovereign Wealth Fund Sound Red Alert But see some of our many posts on private equity’s overstated performance, and the fact that many investors are finally waking up: Private Equity Pummeled by Higher Interest Rates as Portfolio Companies and Credit Funds Struggle; Use of PIK Loans Now Recalls Late 1980s LBO Crisis Billionaire Blasts Private Equity’s Continued Grifting as Performance Falls Further Private Equity Becomes Roach Motel as Public Pension Funds and Other Investors Borrow As Funds Remain Tied Up Private Equity Seeks to Foist Companies It Can’t Sell on Employees As CalPERS Doubles Down on Private Equity, New Analysis Finds CalPERS’ Private Equity Returns “Based on a Mirage;” Another Study Reaffirms that Private Equity Drags Down Performance And that’s before getting to how private equity rentierism is destructive to the public. There is plenty where this came from: Private Equity on Campus: Why College Students Are Sleeping in Cars Buy and Bust: Collapse of Private Equity-Backed Rural Hospitals Mired Employees in Medical Bills Fed Hawkishness, Crypto Implosion, and Private Equity Subscription Lines of Credit Imperil Silicon Valley Bank and Freak Out Bank Stock Investors Plunder: Private Equity’s Plan to Pillage America But it seems inevitable that retail retirement assets will become the last chumps for both PE and crypto. The only question is to what degree. By Jake Johnson, staff writer for Common Dreams. Originally published at Common Dreams U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to sign an executive order on Thursday that would allow private equity and cryptocurrencies into Americans’ 401(k)s, appeasing corporate interests that lobbied for the change and disregarding warnings about the risks it poses to retirement accounts. Citing an unnamed senior White House official, CNN reported that “the order calls for the Labor Department and Securities and Exchange Commission to issue guidance to employers about providing access to those alternative investments in their retirement accounts.” The private equity industry has been working for years to gain access to a portion of the roughly $12 trillion that Americans have saved in workplace retirement plans. “This is the holy grail for private equity,” Axios reported Thursday, noting that federal rules currently bar most defined-contribution plans from investing in private equity and crypto. Both industries spent big on the 2024 election; the investment management behemoth BlackRock, whose CEO has advocated opening 401(k)s to private equity, donated to Trump’s inaugural committee. James Baratta and Whitney Curry Wimbish noted in The American Prospect earlier this year that “there was added desperation from the industry” for access to 401(k)s “because of their dire need for cash amid weakening performance and fewer deals.” “Some firms have begun mortgaging their own funds for money to pay out limited partners,” they added. “Retail investors represented trillions in untapped potential.” Helaine Olen, managing editor at the American Economic Liberties Project and a longtime personal finance columnist, said in a statement Thursday that “stuffing private equity, crypto, and other ‘alternative assets’ into 401(k)s is about propping up scams and bailing out an industry that’s run out of buyers—and it’s being done at the expense of Americans’ retirements everywhere.” “There’s a reason most employers didn’t bite when Trump tried this the first time and why the private investments industry has put on such a thick lobbying campaign,” said Olen. “These funds are high-fee, risky, and opaque. Private equity consistently underperforms the S&P 500. This is a windfall for billionaire fund managers and a disaster in the making for regular Americans trying to save for retirement.” Last week, the Americans for Financial Reform Education Fund and American Federation of Teachers released a report warning that if private equity is given a foothold in 401(k)s, “millions of workers saving for retirement would be exposed to higher risks and steep fees in products that lack basic investor protections and transparency requirements.” The report found that private equity profitability “has been in a year-over-year decline” for the past two decades and that “fee structures—paid directly by investors or indirectly through portfolio companies—are prone to extensive manipulation.” Lisa Donner, co-executive director at Americans for Financial Reform Education Fund, said that “private equity executives have enriched themselves by the billions, taking high fees and other charges from working people’s hard-earned retirement savings in pension funds.” “Now they want fees from the trillions of dollars in individual retirement accounts,” Donner added, “putting millions of more people at risk.” Perhaps the US economy is replicating what happens to snakes under stress? I think it is inevitable, but how to protect ourselves, other than the old fashioned hard work of reading the prospectus and calling the 1-800 line to harangue the advisors? My biggest nightmare is that this crap ends up in target date funds. The sheep will be sheared. What if the 800 line is staffed overseas or even worse, supplemented with a Q&A guided response built on the best AI offerings? Hey dear consumer, please invest your life savings and hold it with “diamond hands!”. \sarc Employers just found a use case for hiring young whippersnapper lawyers fresh from law school. Write some safe harbor language that puts a wide legal moat as possible, and include in all our detailed retirement planning disclosures. Employers all shifted away from defined benefit pensions and that was no accident, unfortunately for mine, ours and future generations. It will be … I had to move my entire IRA holdings, save a few shekels out of Vanguard, for this very reason. The phone customer service deteriorated to the point where it took hours to get through to an overseas call center, none of whom had any authority to do much other than tell me balance info. Welcome to the Motel Crypto Hell … you can check in anytime you want … “It’s a lovely place…” We’re considering this for our IRAs (401(k)s with Fidelity for me, 457(b) 2ith WA PERS for the LHG). Where did you move your funds to? Of course this is all a test run for the real White House objective – privatizing Social Security to Wall Street so that it can be pillaged by them. That is the ultimate aim. Where is a blue dress when you need one? Ask Jeffrey Epstein’s friend. The bubble for crypto is being inflated to incredible levels. Bitcoin is now at $130,000, there are Bitcoin credit cards and now Bitcoin is going to be in 401k funds. I don’t know where this will stop. But in the short term, it’s a rational investment as it’s certain to go up wildly in the next few months at least. I wonder if Bitcoin will reach 1,000,000 before it crashes. Unlike tulips, it has a committed, international, user base. It certainly has more uses then tulips. What’s trending now is using Bitcoin as collateral and never selling it. Obv it will go down at some point but as long as you don’t get liquidated by having a low LTV you’d be fine $4.01k update: This is what everybody was hoping for-legitimacy of packaged air cleverly disguised as cryptos, Bitcoin in particular. Now to come up with appropriate nicknames… Green(screen)backs ” Everybody” ? Which “everybodies”? How many “everybodies”? I understand the regret in missing out on not having a one-figure investment in Bitcoin, some skin in the game. Its never too late and they’re still making 1’s & 0’s~ Which one will they run out of first? I invested in cans of canned fish in cans. I am slowly eating them down. If crypto crashes back to truth-value zero before I have eaten all my cans of canned fish, the fish inside the cans of canned fish that I will still have at that time will still be safely inside of their cans. So whoever might be regretting not having bought Bitco at the start, it isn’t me. I have been true to my pledge, the No Crypto pledge. I pledge, on my honor, that I will neither use crypto nor invest in crypto. And I will not tolerate those who do. The linked AFT/AFREF/AAUP report From Public Pensions to Private Fortunes on how Private Equity morphed from its 1980’s leveraged looting model into a fee-driven billionaire factory is well worth downloading and reading. My only criticism of the report is that it fails to emphasize how campaign cash and outright graft have destroyed the democratic process that should have caused regulators, legislators, and fiduciary boards to rein-in this devastating looting of the commons. Trump’s proposal is nakedly transactional, like everything he does.

It seems, in this day and age, the latest and greatest digital invention 10 years ago, becomes obsolete with the passage of time. Devil’s Own Advocate: What if Bitcoin et al was the stalking horse that Wall*Street pinned the tale on, when things come a cropper? When things come a cropper, the canned fish inside my cans of canned fish in cans will still be inside my cans of canned fish in cans. Those who can invest in Reality and Survival should do so rather than investing in munny or sekyooriteez or stokz or bahndz or such, to the extent that they are able. Those who are only a little bit able can still invest a little bit in a little bit of Reality and Survival. Sardines perhaps? But would they be eating sardines or trading sardines? https://novelinvestor.com/happy-hour-trading-sardines/ Sardines are wonderful. They are low on the food chain so they accumulate least-feasible contanimants. They last for several years inside the cans so you can eat them at leisure. And the cans themselves can be saved for arts-and-crafts purposes around the home. I must confess, I had never heard of the concept of trading sardines till now. It makes a fine apocryphal tale. If you are speculating on trading sardines, why would you ever bother to worry about what is in the can? Till you are hungry and have to liquidate your speculative investment one can at a time.

Title: BlackRock Rumored to Dump $664M in Bitcoin and Ethereum—What Happens if Trust Breaks?
URL: https://partner.cryptopolitan.com/blackrock-rumored-to-dump-664m-in-bitcoin-and-ethereum-what-happens-if-trust-breaks/
Time Published: 2025-08-08T06:44:00Z
Full Content:
New reports suggest that BlackRock may be preparing to offload over $664 million in Bitcoin and Ethereum, as ETF-linked wallet data shows potential movement across key custody addresses. According to blockchain analytics firm Arkham Intelligence, four wallets tied to BlackRock’s IBIT and ETHA ETFs appear to have shifted large reserves in recent days – raising alarms among market watchers about whether a major liquidation event is on the horizon. The total holdings in question—11,400 BTC and 26,000 ETH—represent one of the largest aggregated positions by a single asset manager. While no official confirmation has come from BlackRock, analysts are warning that even the rumor of such a dump could be enough to destabilize market sentiment in the short term. And if investor confidence is shaken, it could lead to capital fleeing toward more nimble, high-growth crypto plays—especially emerging tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE that offer early-stage upside and no institutional overhang. Why a BlackRock sell-off could shift the narrative The speculation has ignited concerns about centralized influence over crypto markets. If BlackRock, seen as a trusted bridge between Wall Street and blockchain, begins unloading assets, it could signal broader doubt in current valuations – or even pre-positioning for a deeper macro pullback. Either way, such a move risks breaking trust among retail and institutional investors alike, particularly those who bought into ETFs expecting long-term holding strategies. Historically, market shocks like this have led to surges in interest for smaller, decentralized, community-backed tokens. And with sentiment this fragile, even a partial dump could redirect billions in retail flow toward early-stage opportunities tokens not yet tied to institutional risk or old-cycle baggage. $5,000 could deliver $550,000 once MAGACOIN FINANCE hits major exchanges That’s precisely why MAGACOIN FINANCE is now emerging as a top pick among early-mover investors. Still in its early phase, this politically charged coin has already outperformed expectations in terms of engagement, wallet sign-ups, and on-chain activity. But it’s the projected upside that’s turning heads: analysts now believe that a $5,000 investment at today’s rate could grow into $550,000 once MAGACOIN FINANCE gets listed on major exchanges and becomes globally accessible. What sets it apart? MAGACOIN FINANCE is blending virality with calculated rollout mechanics and a built-in ideological movement – attracting both hype traders and long-term ecosystem builders. Its rounds are closing fast, and the token has already surpassed early momentum levels seen in SHIBA INU and DOGE’s initial phases. Unlike assets weighed down by ETF custody issues or legacy reputation, MAGACOIN is clean, nimble, and built for exponential scaling. And in a post-BlackRock trust shake-up, MAGACOIN FINANCE could offer the kind of fresh start and narrative clarity the market desperately needs. As institutions wobble, early-stage plays surge While large asset managers like BlackRock have brought credibility to the crypto space, they’ve also introduced traditional finance behaviors – like strategic selling, liquidity protection, and risk management – that don’t always align with crypto’s ethos. If retail begins to feel burned by centralized exits, expect a mass migration to new, decentralized alternatives, particularly those not yet influenced by ETF politics or institutional pacing. Projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE, which have no legacy exposure and are just entering their growth phase, stand to capture the fallout from any broken trust in the top-tier token space. Conclusion: Institutions may sell – early movers will seek the next frontier Whether or not BlackRock executes a full sell-off, the market is clearly watching. And in moments like these, capital tends to flow fast toward uncorrelated opportunities. With MAGACOIN FINANCE offering projected 110x upside and gaining global traction ahead of its major listings, it’s no surprise that analysts are calling it the top altcoin bet in a post-ETF correction world.

Title: XRP price jumps 11% as SEC and Ripple formally dismiss appeals

About us Copy link After nearly five years of courtroom combat, the US Securities and Exchange Commission and Ripple Labs are putting away their swords. The two sides jointly agreed to dismiss their respective appeals in the XRP securities case, officially ending one of crypto’s largest legal battles and sending the token up 11% on Thursday. “Following the Commission’s vote today, the SEC and Ripple formally filed directly with the Second Circuit to dismiss their appeals,” Ripple chief legal officer Stuart Alderoty wrote on X, “The end, and now back to business.” According to the SEC, the joint stipulation covers Ripple Labs, CEO Brad Garlinghouse, and co-founder Christian Larsen. The dismissal resolves the agency’s civil enforcement action, leaving in place a final judgment imposing a $125,035,150 penalty on Ripple and a permanent injunction against violating the registration provisions of the Securities Act of 1933. Ripple had sought to cut that figure to $50 million as part of a conditional settlement, but Judge Analisa Torres rejected the proposal in June, ruling that neither side had “come close” to justifying a change to her final judgment. ETFStore president Nate Geraci said the truce “clears the way” for spot XRP exchange-traded funds, with Bloomberg analysts putting approval odds at 95% ahead of an October deadline. “I think BlackRock was waiting to see this before filing for iShares XRP ETF,” Geraci added, arguing it makes “zero sense” for issuers to ignore crypto assets beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. XRP is currently trading for $3.31. Kyle Baird is DL News’ Weekend Editor. Got a tip? Email at kbaird@dlnews.com.

Title: Ireland women’s rugby coach defends capping two ex-England players in World Cup prep

Time Published: 2025-08-08T05:00:01Z

Ireland head coach Scott Bemand has defended the inclusion of two new players in Ireland’s World Cup preparation. It comes after former England international Ellena Perry was named to make her debut off the bench in Saturday’s warm-up match against Canada in Belfast. Perry, who earned the last of her 11 England caps in 2020 and therefore satisfies World Rugby’s stand down rules for switching nations, qualifies through an Irish grandparent. She was brought into the set-up a few weeks ago but, with tighthead prop Christy Haney struggling to make the World Cup squad due to a hamstring injury, Bemand has decided to play Perry as loosehead cover on the bench. Perry is the second new player from outside the Irish system given a debut in as many weeks. Last weekend, Exeter centre Nancy McGillivray, who has been named in England squads without ever being capped, debuted after qualifying through her Irish-born father. She has been on Ireland’s radar for some time, but only became available after her England contract expired in June. Both Perry and McGillivray are expected to be named in the final World Cup squad, to be announced on Monday. Perry is likely to come in for the injured Haney, while McGillivray is not expected to oust any of Eve Higgins, Aoife Dalton or Enya Breen, Ireland’s centres from the Six Nations. Instead, an outside back is likely to make way. Ahead of Saturday’s game in Belfast, Bemand was asked if introducing players from outside the system so close to the competition risked upsetting the squad dynamic. “If done incorrectly [yes],” he said. “But with Christy [Haney] picking up the hamstring niggle we needed to bring in and supplement front row. So actually, everything has been done well, in my opinion. [ Former England prop Ellena Perry in line to make Ireland debut against CanadaOpens in new window ] “Elle [Perry] is a good player, and she’s a really good person, having worked with her before. She’s known to a good few of the girls [Perry is teammates of Neve Jones and Sam Monaghan at Gloucester] and they would endorse that.” While the new caps can be explained by injury and waiting for contracts to expire, that Ireland looked externally may send a message that the current development pathways don’t have World Cup-ready players. Uncapped Ulster and Railway prop Sophie Barrett was one name overlooked by the inclusion of Perry. Yet, other inclusions, such as the potential World Cup place for Under-20 forward Beth Buttimer, would push back against that narrative, one which Bemand is keen to dispel. “If you look at the number of players now coming through from the women’s national talent squad, in girls that are getting touch points through Sevens, through Celtic Challenge, through the Under-20s, our depth is night and day to how it looked two years ago. “Sophie’s [Barrett] nearly ready and if we had to call Sophie up, we’d be confident in what Sophie’s capabilities are. She also hasn’t played Test match rugby yet. “Ivana Kiripati, Ailish Quinn, Jemima Adams Verde ... we’ve got three players that have had touch points with the 20s in the near recent past. Ailish came on and got a first cap last week against Scotland. “So girls coming through the pathway, through the Under-20s is significant. It’s brilliant. I’m excited for the future.” IRELAND (v Canada, World cup-warm-up, Affidea Stadium, Belfast, Saturday, 12pm): Stacey Flood (Railway Union/Leinster); Béibhinn Parsons (Blackrock College/Connacht), Aoife Dalton (Old Belvedere/Leinster), Enya Breen (Blackrock College/Munster), Anna McGann (Railway Union); Dannah O’Brien (Old Belvedere/Leinster), Aoibheann Reilly (Blackrock College/Connacht); Niamh O’Dowd (Old Belvedere/Leinster), Neve Jones (Gloucester Hartpury), Linda Djougang (Old Belvedere/Leinster); Ruth Campbell (Old Belvedere/Leinster), Fiona Tuite (Old Belvedere/Ulster); Grace Moore (Trailfinders/IQ Rugby), Ivana Kiripati (Creggs/Connacht), Brittany Hogan (Old Belvedere/Ulster).

Title: Transport authority approves settlement of Swords BusConnects corridor legal action

The board of the National Transport Authority (NTA) has approved a proposed settlement to halt legal action taken against its planned BusConnects corridor from Swords to Dublin city centre. The NTA would not disclose the terms of the settlement, but the board’s approval raises hopes judicial review proceedings will be dropped to allow construction of the 12km route granted planning permission more than a year ago. The Swords corridor is one of 12 segregated bus routes to be built as part of the €4 billion scheme to transform the capital’s bus services. The planned route runs from the south side of Swords town in north Dublin, past Dublin Airport and through Santry along the Swords Road, then along the Drumcondra Road and Dorset Street to the top of O’Connell Street and Parnell Square. The NTA secured permission from An Bord Pleanála for the route in June of last year, but judicial review proceedings against the board’s decision were initiated in August by two separate parties: owners of a business park near the airport and a veterinary practice south of Swords. The cases have not yet been heard in the High Court but in their submissions to An Bord Pleanála both Brendan Collins, of Collinstown Business Park, and Conor O’Scanaill, of O’Scanaill Veterinary Surgeons, raised concerns about the effect the bus corridor would have on their properties. Minutes of a recent NTA board meeting show details of a “settlement proposal” were presented to the board by interim NTA chief executive Hugh Creegan. “Following the overview provided, the board approved the terms of the proposed agreement to settle the particular judicial reviews proceedings being taken in relation to the Swords to City Centre Core Bus Corridor scheme,” the minutes state. This is the first settlement approved by the board in an effort to bring an end to legal action taken against one of the bus corridor schemes. Of the 12 corridors, judicial review proceedings have been taken in relation to seven, the corridors from Swords, Clongriffin, Belfield/Blackrock, Blanchardstown, Templeogue/Rathfarnham, Bray and Kimmage. The other five now have “full” planning permission as the time frame by which they could be challenged in the courts has expired. These are the routes from Ballymun/Finglas, Liffey Valley, Ringsend, Tallaght/Clondalkin and Lucan. [ BusConnects route will come in ‘on time, on budget’, says Darragh O’BrienOpens in new window ] Green Party transport spokesman Feljin Jose said the delays caused by the judicial reviews were extremely concerning. “The NTA has to build three of these at the same time over the next four to five years to get this done this side of 2035. Seven out of the 12 approved corridors in judicial review is not a good return rate and will add at least a year, maybe up to two years, delay.” The settlement of the Swords cases would be a win for Dubliners, he said. “Without knowing the details of the settlement I can only say it’s good news if the cases are dropped and the quicker we can get this done and have bus priority and improved cycling and pedestrian infrastructure.” The plaintiffs and their legal representatives declined to comment on the settlement agreement. A spokeswoman for the NTA said it could not comment on the details of the proposed agreement “other than to acknowledge that the board approved the terms of the agreement at the June board” meeting. Construction of the first core bus corridor from Liffey Valley to the city centre is due to begin next month.

Title: Rugby’s next generation: Meet the rising stars of Leinster, Ulster, Connacht and Munster
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/rugby/2025/08/08/irelands-next-gen-whos-who-in-the-four-provincial-rugby-academies/
Time Published: 2025-08-08T05:00:00Z
Full Content:
Connacht academy manager Eric Elwood knows the value of a good young ‘un having led the Ireland Under-20s to a Grand Slam in 2007. So it’s no surprise that the province’s first-year intake for next season includes three players – flanker Bobby Power, hooker Mikey Yarr and secondrow David Walsh – from Neil Doak’s national age-grade squad. Another, number eight Aaron O’Brien, would have played but for injury. Connacht welcome eight players into the academy – five from Leinster in Yarr, Walsh, Dan Ryan, an Ireland Under-19 international wing educated at St Michael’s College, and outhalf Conor O’Shaughnessy, who played All-Ireland League for Blackrock College last season having made the short journey to Stradbrook from the school. O’Brien was a standout schools player at St Mary’s College and also in underage representative rugby with Leinster and Ireland. They join Power, fellow Galway man Seán Walsh, a centre who has represented Ireland at Under-19 international level, and backrow Diarmuid O’Connell from Carrick-on-Shannon. Elwood’s decision to recruit outside the province is sensible and underlines that he is looking to attract the best young players into the pathway. Newbridge-born prop Billy Bohan is in his second year, while wing James Nicholson (Wicklow) and hooker Matthew Victory (Dublin) are in their final year. Connacht are not alone in this respect as Ulster and Munster also have players born in Leinster in their respective academies, hardly a surprise given the numbers game, not least population size. Ulster have persuaded Balbriggan-born wing Aitzol Arenzana-King, a former Irish 20s Grand Slam winner, to make the journey to Belfast where he will join Dubliners Sam Berman and Tom Brigg, along with South African-born centre Wilhelm de Klerk, who came to Dublin as a 10-year-old and played rugby in St Michael’s. Richie Murphy’s Grand Slam and World Cup exploits with the Irish 20s was a facilitator in attracting some top young players to Ulster from outside the province. Hooker Connor Magee, prop Flynn Longstaff, promising outhalf Daniel Green and wing Josh Gibson join Arenzana-King as the five new faces in the academy. Props George Hadden, from Gorey, and Ronan Foxe from Rahugh near Tullamore are in their final year in the Munster academy. The first-year intake of five players includes two, Oisín Minogue and Tom Wood, fought their way into starting positions with the Irish 20s despite being a year young for the grade. Openside flanker Minogue got better with every opportunity through the Six Nations and then the World Championship in Italy, while Wood also demonstrated impressive composure and a tidy skill set to eventually claim the number 10 jersey in the maelstrom of a difficult season for the squad. They are joined by secondrow Conor Kennelly, prop Emmet Calvey and centre Eoghan Smyth. Five of Leinster’s nine strong first-year intake played for the Irish 20s last season – centres Connor Fahy and Ciarán Mangan, wing Páidí Farrell, prop Alex Mullan and secondrow Mahon Ronan. Todd Lawlor would have but for injury. Six of the newbies are backs.

Title: Trump opens the door for crypto and private equity in your 401(k) plan

Watch CBS News August 7, 2025 / 7:48 PM EDT / CBS/AP President Trump on Thursday signed an executive order that could allow millions of Americans saving for retirement through 401(k) accounts to invest in higher-risk private equity and cryptocurrency assets. The executive order doesn't immediately change how people will invest for retirement through their employer-sponsored accounts, as federal agencies would need to rewrite regulations to allow expanded investment choices. That's a process that experts say could take months, or longer, to complete. But once done, employers could offer a broader array of mutual funds and investments to workers, according to the White House. New plans could invest in alternative assets, particularly private equity, cryptocurrencies and real estate. The move comes as the 401(k) has become the primary vehicle for American workers to save for retirement, with most employers offering a menu of investment choices among major asset classes, such as stock-based mutual funds. The $5 trillion private equity industry, which makes investments into private businesses rather than publicly traded stocks, has for decades wanted to compete for a role in retirement plans. At the same time, the cryptocurrency industry, whose executives strongly supported Trump's 2024 campaign, has aimed for more mainstream acceptance among Americans. "It was inevitable that bitcoin would make its way into American 401(k)'s," said Cory Klippsten, the CEO of Swan Bitcoin. "As fiduciaries realize bitcoin's risk-adjusted upside over the long term, we'll see growing allocations, especially from younger, tech-savvy workers who want hard money, not melting ice cubes." The EO could give private equity and crypto firms long-sought access to a pool of funds worth trillions. Investment companies applauded Mr. Trump's executive order, with TIAA, which manages the retirement assets of teachers, professors and other academics, and investing giant BlackRock saying they support the measure for providing a broader number of investment strategies to workers. "We believe end investors can benefit from the advantages that private investments can offer when embedded within professionally managed vehicles like target date funds or through guaranteed annuity products," TIAA said in a statement emailed to CBS MoneyWatch. The president's order directs the Labor Department and other agencies to redefine what would be considered a qualified asset under 401(k) retirement rules. Americans' retirement plans are governed by a law known as the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, better known as ERISA. Employers are required by law to offer retirement options that are in the best interest of their employees, not Wall Street. Most retirement plans for Americans are made up of stock and bond investments, and to a much lesser extent, cash and heavily traded commodities such as gold. Even after the regulations are written, it will take time for the major retirement plan companies such as Fidelity, Vanguard, T. Rowe Price and others, to develop appropriate funds for employers to use. Employers are not likely to revise their retirement plan options quickly as well, so it may take several years before crypto and private equity investments are mainstream in an individual's retirement plan. The price of bitcoin was up 2% on Thursday to $116,542 and has nearly doubled since Trump was elected. Under Democratic President Joe Biden, federal regulators were to treat cryptocurrency investments with "extreme care" because of the extreme volatility of crypto. It is not uncommon for bitcoin, ethereum and other big cryptocurrencies to move up or down 10% in a single day, whereas a 2% or 3% single-day move in the stock market would be considered historic. For cryptocurrency companies, which donated millions to Trump's campaign as well as his inauguration, one goal was to get their industry qualified under ERISA. Coinbase, one of the largest crypto companies in the United States, was also a major donor toward Trump's military parade in Washington this summer. Under Trump, the Securities and Exchange Commission dropped its lawsuit against Coinbase, where the Biden administration said crypto should be treated as a security. Crypto is particularly popular among young Americans. While volatile, bitcoin has generally moved upward since it was created by an anonymous programmer nearly 20 years ago. Private equity firms rely heavily on high-net-worth individuals and state and private pension plans, which have extremely long investment timelines. But having access to Americans' retirement assets would open up a deep pool of cash. Blackstone CEO Steve Schwarzman has told investors going back to at least 2017 that it was a "dream" of his and the industry to be able to draw upon these retirement assets. Previous administrations, Republican and Democrat alike, had agreed that private equity investments, which can be riskier, more expensive and less liquid than traditional stock and bond market mutual funds, should not be included in 401(k) plans. © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

Title: JUST IN – Trump Executive Order To Expand 401(k) Investment Options, Including Crypto

US President Donald Trump is preparing to sign an executive order this Thursday that could shake up how Americans invest for retirement. The move would allow 401(k) plans to include a wider range of assets — like private equity, real estate, and yes, even cryptocurrency. The order, as reported by Bloomberg News, tells the Labor Department to take another look at the current rules under ERISA — that’s the Employee Retirement Income Security Act — and figure out how to give retirement plan administrators more room to include less traditional, higher-risk investments. Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer has been tasked with working alongside the Treasury, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and other federal agencies to make this happen. The main goal? Give plan sponsors a clearer roadmap to offer more diverse investment options, without falling foul of the law. Donald Trump will sign an executive order that aims to allow private equity, real estate, cryptocurrency and other alternative assets in 401(k)s https://t.co/IXetIBnTzL — Bloomberg (@business) August 7, 2025 Right now, most of the $12 trillion sitting in 401(k)s is invested in good old-fashioned stocks and bonds. But with this new push, savers might soon get the option to invest in assets that were once out of reach. That said, it’s not as simple as just adding a few new buttons on a retirement dashboard. Offering private equity or crypto means plan administrators will have to show that they’ve done their homework — that the managers are qualified, the fees are fair, and that everything lines up with fiduciary standards. Supporters of the move argue that expanding into private markets could lead to better long-term returns, especially in times when public markets are lagging. Critics, however, worry about the downsides — like high fees, limited access to funds, and the risks that come with less liquid investments. Big players like Blackstone, Apollo, and KKR could benefit big-time from the change. In fact, BlackRock is already planning to roll out a new 401(k) fund with private investments in 2026. Empower Retirement is expected to launch similar offerings later this year. What really stands out in this executive order is its nod to crypto. It’s the latest in a series of moves that show Trump warming up to digital assets. Just this past summer, the White House hosted “Crypto Week,” discussed new rules for stablecoins, and even floated the idea of a national Bitcoin reserve. The new order reportedly asks the SEC to loosen restrictions that have kept crypto out of most retirement plans. If successful, this could open the door for Bitcoin, stablecoins, and other digital assets to become part of Americans’ retirement portfolios.

Skip to comments. Posted on 08/07/2025 3:19:37 PM PDT by JSM_Liberty U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Thursday that aims to allow private equity, real estate, cryptocurrency, and other alternative assets in 401(k) retirement accounts. The order smoothes the way for private equity and other fund managers to tap into trillions of dollars of Americans' retirement savings. It could open up a vast new funding source to managers of alternative assets outside of stocks, bonds, and cash, though critics say it also could bring too much risk into retirement investments. "The Securities and Exchange Commission must consider ways to facilitate access to alternative asset investments by participants in defined-contribution retirement plans," ... the White House said. It directs the Labor Secretary to consult with her counterparts at the Treasury Department, the SEC, and other federal regulators, and to "re-examine" previous guidance. Such a move could be a boon for big alternative asset managers such as Blackstone , KKR , and Apollo Global Management , by opening the $12-trillion market for retirement funds, known as defined contribution plans, to their investments. Some of those firms have already struck partnerships with asset managers who run those plans. The world's largest asset manager, BlackRock (BK.N) , plans to launch its own retirement fund that includes private equity and private credit assets next year. Proponents argue that younger savers can benefit from potentially higher returns on riskier investments in funds that get more conservative as they approach retirement. "On the asset manager side, it's a $12-trillion retirement market that they have previously not had access to. For them, there's certainly a lot of opportunity," said Morningstar analyst Jason Kephart. "From the individual investor standpoint, though, that's where it's less clear after all the additional fees, the additional complexity, and less transparency," Kephart added.
