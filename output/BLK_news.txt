As we bring down the curtain on 2024 with our final newsfeed of the year, this countdown of our 40 most-read news stories highlights an industry hyper-focused on threats, opportunities and money. Amazon Prime’s The Rings of Power failed to halt job losses at the streamer I’ll be honest, dear reader, sometimes you guys break my heart. That exclusive we spent weeks on, that story we fought with the lawyers over, that line we spent months double sourcing, that saucy bit of industry gossip we worked so hard to stand up… then I pull up our most read stories at the end of the year and proudly top of the pile is a news brief about a Turkish drama being renewed for a sixth season. That is, thankfully, not the case for 2024. In fact, this year’s top 40 countdown of our most read news stories re-affirms our editorial priorities when we sit down every morning at 06.30 (slightly later if QPR have won the night before) and start putting together our daily newsfeed. Those priorities, other than ‘have we got this exclusively?’, can most simply be categorised into one of three piles: Is this a threat? Is this an opportunity? Is this about money? Just about every one of the stories on our top 40 countdown this year fits one of those categories. The most clear and obvious threat, all year, was job losses. We started the year in New Orleans listening to factual producers talking “Survive to 25” and, sure enough, it’s been a bloodbath out there. “Amazon axing ‘several hundred’ jobs across Prime Video and MGM Studios” at number one, “500 more jobs to go at BBC as BBCS sales suffer in a ‘challenging’ market” at number 10, Paramount’s ongoing cuts and merger chat at 12, and 19, myriad crises in Canada (30), and New Zealand (40). There were late year entries for the looming spectre of AI, most notably OpenAI’s Sora launch at Content London and the subsequent fall out which saw Simon Mirren label the tech “the greatest IP theft in history” (7) and the outright panic among natural history filmmakers in particular at WildScreen the month before (6). AI continued to make the headlines in 2024 AI could of course be an opportunity as well. Embattled, skint production companies able to save huge amounts of time, resource and money on the wage bill by having the tech do the dog work. Minority voices may also be more empowered to tell their stories with the boundaries of money and commissioners stripped away. Still though, individual execs moving around feature heavily in our countdown as always. Has my favourite commissioner just lost her job, and what does that mean for my prospects at that network? Are they moving to a bigger, better network that I haven’t worked with before and now have an ‘in’ at? Or, perhaps you lot are just nosey, gossipy sorts. Either way André Renaud heading to Warner Bros from BBC Studios (2), Charlie Irwin stepping up as Jonno Richards leaves the forever merging/separating Fremantle labels Talkback and Thames (11), Elizabeth Randell at BBC Studios Kids & Family (14), Alexandra Finlay’s departure at A+E Networks (16), Rola Bauer’s latest movements (21), and new gigs for Channel 4 alums Carline Horlick (29) and Phil Harris (32) show this is still a people business – the machines haven’t taken over just yet. Money looms large over this list. More so than the content, which is really only represented by a handful of stories mostly about Netflix (4th, 22nd, 31st, 34th). Who’s got it, who don’t got it, and how can I get some? Problems facing studios space in the UK (5), companies like Anton/Blackrock splashing cash (24), financials at Channel 4 and Netflix (26 and 27) and the latest state of British exports and copro market (36) all rated highly. It’s the economy, stupid. Threat, opportunity, money. Your success or otherwise in 2025 will likely depend which of those three piles we find ourselves placing the majority of stories about your company… The top 40…

Title: Greystar buys Dublin student housing scheme for around €150m

Full Content:
A US-headquartered property investor has acquired the largest purpose-built student accommodation development in the Republic for around €150 million, marking the biggest residential property deal of the year. Greystar, the South Carolina-anchored property investment company, has agreed to buy the Michael O’Flynn-developed Point Campus scheme in Dublin’s docklands from German asset manager DWS. The deal marks Greystar’s first foray into the student housing market in the Republic and the €150 million price tag makes it the largest single residential property deal in the Republic in 2024. The second biggest was DWS’s €97.5 million deal for the 207-unit Hayfield apartment project in Killiney. In a statement on Friday, Greystar said the fully occupied 966-bed Point Campus development will be operated by its student housing platform Canvas, which currently operates beds in the UK, the Netherlands and Spain. Claire Solon, managing director of Greystar Ireland, said the group is “excited to enter the student accommodation market” in the Republic. “We believe the business is well positioned to benefit from strong ongoing demand from Irish and international students, given the undersupply of high quality and professionally-managed accommodation.” Originally developed by Mr O’Flynn and global fund giant BlackRock in 2016, Point Campus was acquired by Deutsche Bank subsidiary DWS in 2020, reportedly for some €172 million. In addition to the bed spaces, the building includes a cinema, a gym, a common room and a roof terrace and is adjacent to the Point Square shopping centre and the 3Arena in the north docklands. Greystar has been involved in several high-profile property deals, including its 2022 acquisition of Dalguise House in Monkstown, South Dublin for around €30 million. The firm subsequently applied for permission to build 488 apartments on the site. An Bord Pleanála approved a scaled-down scheme in February, ordering the removal of 101 units from the plan. Market dynamics in the Republic remain extremely favourable for purpose-built student accommodation investors, with Dublin alone experiencing an acute shortfall of between 25,000 and 65,000-bed spaces relative to demand, according to estimates. However, the industry voiced its concern earlier this year after the Government legislated over the summer to effectively ban the practice of large-scale student landlords offering 51-week-only leases at their properties. The new law, which means student housing operators must also offer standard 41-week leases to students, more in line with the typical academic year, followed a decision by some large-scale operators to switch to a 51-week-only lease model. The change by operators was criticised by the then-minister for higher education Simon Harris and Sinn Féin’s higher education spokeswoman Mairéad Farrell as well as student unions and the representative body for Ireland’s university sector. An amendment to the Residential Tenancies Act, effectively banning companies from offering only lengthier leases, was passed by the Dáil in July, prompting threats of legal action from some companies.

Title: PitchBook: Enterprise tech momentum in 2025 will be fueled by AI growth and crypto revival
URL: https://siliconangle.com/2024/12/20/pitchbook-enterprise-tech-momentum-2025-will-fueled-ai-growth-crypto-revival/
Time Published: 2024-12-20T05:01:45Z
Full Content:
UPDATED 00:01 EST / DECEMBER 20 2024 by Duncan Riley The enterprise technology market is set to undergo transformative changes in 2025, driven by advancements in artificial intelligence, crypto and vertical integration, according to the annual 2025 Enterprise Technology Outlook report from PitchBook Data Inc. To no one’s surprise, given the massive growth in the sector through 2024, the report leads with AI and machine learning. OpenAI set a high-water benchmark for AI startups, reaching a $157 billion valuation. 2024 also saw private companies, including ByteDance Ltd. and SpaceX, hit or surpass $100 billion valuations. PitchBook used the term “centicorn” to describe them. The report predicts that 2025 will see the rise of more “centicorns” in the AI sector, with private companies such as Anthropic PBC, CoreWeave Inc. and Databricks Inc. set to follow OpenAI’s trajectory. Anthropic, backed by Amazon Web Services Inc. and others, is on track to exceed $1 billion in revenue by leveraging its privacy-focused models to capture a significant share of the generative AI market. Likewise, CoreWeave’s hardware-centric business model is forecast to achieve a 230% revenue increase in 2025, driven by demand for inference computing. Another contender for centicorn status, Databricks, recently raised $10 billion on a $62 billion valuation and is predicted by PitchBook to be a strong candidate for a $100 billion valuation in 2025. The developments highlight the expanding market opportunities and investor confidence in AI as a key driver in enterprise innovation. On the cryptocurrency front, PitchBook forecasts a resurgence in venture capital funding, with annual investments projected to exceed $18 billion in 2025. The forecast marks a significant recovery from the more subdued levels over the last two years, when funding hovered at about $9.9 billion annually. The report attributes the revival in the cryptocurrency sector to growing institutional involvement from major players such as BlackRock Inc. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc., whose regulatory credibility and established networks are driving broader market confidence. The report also notes a shift in investment priorities within the crypto ecosystem. PitchBook believes that generalist VCs will reenter the market in 2025 with a focus on startups with clear use cases in decentralized finance, Web3 infrastructure and consumer-facing applications. The renewed interest is anticipated to result in larger funding rounds and higher valuations, especially for late-stage investments. For the enterprise software-as-a-service market in 2025, the report comes back to AI, specifically the rise of autonomous AI agents in reshaping operations and customer engagement. AI agents, autonomous systems powered by AI designed to perform specific tasks or make decisions with minimal human intervention, are expected to streamline workflows and automate complex tasks across sectors such as human resources, analytics and customer relationship management. Integrating into existing SaaS ecosystems, agents are expected to allow businesses to drive efficiency while enhancing the quality of customer interactions. PitchBook believes that AI agents will particularly disrupt customer relationship management and enterprise resource planning platforms, where AI agents are already delivering real-time, personalized support and decision-making capabilities. SaaS vendors are increasingly adopting AI agents to create tailored, industry-specific solutions that boost customer loyalty and reduce operational costs. Other trends forecast for 2025 in the report include a growing role for regulatory technology in enterprise fintech mergers and acquisitions, driven by its niche specializations despite underfunding in the sector. Consolidation in DevOps is also anticipated next year as major SaaS providers acquire startups to streamline fragmented markets and enhance competitive offerings. Additionally, insurance technology is noted as seeing increased vertical integration, with companies adopting seamless models that combine products, insurance and services to improve customer experiences and operational efficiency.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of the 10 Best Growth Stocks To Invest In Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) stands against other best growth stocks. Is a December rally in store for stocks in 2024? Some investors are expecting a surge in stocks from the 24th of December to the 3rd of January, 2025, also referred to as the Santa Claus Rally. On December 17, Ryan Detric, Chief Market Strategist at Carson Group, Joined Catalysts on Yahoo Finance to discuss whether he expects December to be a record-breaking month for the stock market. Historically, the first half of December is usually slow for the stock market, while the second half is faster, suggested Detric. He also added that compared to election years in the past, this December has been very “flattish” so far. He also suggested that the Fed is going to continue the easing cycle and with the CPI declining, the current market conditions are favorable. Detrick then added that despite macroeconomic conditions and the performance of the Dow Jones index recently, he expects to see a record surge this month and expects “Santa Claus” to make an appearance this year. Since the elections, stocks have been rallying with high hopes for the future. On December 18, Dan Ives, Managing Director at Wedbush Securities, joined Market Domination on Yahoo Finance to discuss his outlook on Big Tech and the new administration. Ives emphasized that the autonomous robotics and disruptive technologies sectors are going to benefit strongly from the new administration and its policies, despite concerns over tariffs. He also discussed the growing relationship between the new administration and Elon Musk, and how the two parties “need each other” to thrive, suggesting that Musk’s company has solid growth potential in the coming year and AI innovation will strengthen the collaboration immensely. He also added that the environment is extremely bullish for Big Tech and expects growth in the coming year. Ives shared that while there are a few road bumps, especially from the Chinese market, the environment in retrospect is positive. Speaking of the electric vehicle market, he emphasized that new policies in the US coupled with international consolidation, especially in Europe and Asia, will benefit EV makers in the United States immensely. The expectations from growth stocks are immense as the AI revolution takes precedence. To come up with the 10 best growth stocks to invest in now, we went over multiple rankings on the internet to compile an initial list of growth stocks. We then examined the hedge fund sentiment of each stock and picked the most popular ones. Our list is in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders as of Q3 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A robotic arm holding a semiconductor chip, emphasizing the precision and quality of the company's production equipment. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 107 Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) ranks ninth on our list of the best growth stocks to invest in. The semiconductor and IT company produces accelerators that are capable of managing complex AI workloads, because of high bandwidth memory and a huge memory density. Previously in October, the company unveiled new processors to power the next generation of commercial PCs and launched high-performance computing solutions to keep up with the AI computing era. Fast forward to December 10, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) announced the expansion of its AMD Versal adaptive system-on-chip (SoC) portfolio with the new Versal RF Series. The new series offers unmatched compute performance and precise observability. In the third quarter of 2024, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) generated $6.8 billion in revenue, up by 18% year-over-year and 17% sequentially. The company attributed its strong financial results to revenue growth in data center and client segments. Overall, the company is leading the AI and technology wave with its advanced accelerators and processors and expects to deliver strong results over the next few years in data center and client segments. Overall, AMD ranks 9th on our list of the best growth stocks to invest in. While we acknowledge the potential of AMD to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

The video, which is housed on the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) ETF page on BlackRock’s website, spends three minutes walking viewers through the evolution of money and key fundamentals of Bitcoin. One of those fundamentals is Bitcoin’s 21 million fixed token supply. While the video explains the pros of Bitcoin’s fixed supply, a caption simultaneously cautions viewers with a disclaimer: “There is no guarantee Bitcoin’s 21 million supply cap will not be changed.” That’s a sore spot for Bitcoin maximalists, who hold Bitcoin’s fixed supply as a nearly sacred tenet that ensures the cryptocurrency’s status as “hard money.” The caption remains for approximately five seconds, eventually fading away as the narrator elaborates on the benefits of a fixed supply, never addressing the potential change. Most crypto observers might have missed it if not for MicroStrategy founder and massive Bitcoin bull Michael Saylor sharing the video on his X account on Tuesday. BlackRock explains #Bitcoinpic.twitter.com/X2fPl8tL2s — Michael Saylor⚡️ (@saylor) December 17, 2024 And despite being just a footnote in the video, crypto observers have now latched onto the disclaimer and raised alarms. “This is the problem with tradfi,” Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko commented on X, referring to traditional finance and Wall Street. “They see crypto as an investment into a thing external to them,” he posted. He then challenged both BlackRock and Saylor to commit to running their own full nodes—that is, the software that operates the Bitcoin network—and guarantee they would only ever support the fork that maintains a fixed 21 million supply. “They need to become the decentralized network, not be investors of it,” Yakovenko said. This is the problem with tradfi. They see crypto as an investment into a thing external to them. What blackrock and saylor needs to commit to is that their own full nodes will always guarantees 21m supply and they will only call the fork that their full nodes follow Bitcoin.… https://t.co/h4oHMQyse7 — toly 🇺🇸 (@aeyakovenko) December 19, 2024 Part of the reason this has got Bitcoiners and other crypto users so worked up is because it isn’t the first time BlackRock has made such a disclaimer. The company included a note in its June 2023 ETF filing which indicated that “a hard fork could change the source code to the Bitcoin network, including the 21 million Bitcoin supply cap.” Some of the more paranoid in crypto began speculating immediately that BlackRock might use its newfound power as one of the biggest Bitcoin holders in the world to influence changes to the network, including the BTC supply. Commenting yesterday on the new ad, author and philosopher Steve Patterson said on X: “You really think your little fucking node running on a Raspberry Pi is going to prevent Blackrock from uncapping the supply of Bitcoin?” Are these concerns unfounded? Probably, but it’s got the Bitcoin community talking, including Blockstream founder Adam Back and early dev Peter Todd (who HBO recently suggested could be Satoshi Nakamoto himself). A hard fork would require a majority of the Bitcoin miners, or those producing blocks and verifying transactions, to agree on new supply mechanics—something most in crypto suspect will never happen. Still, Todd today reminded the community that it is technically possible. “Obviously, if the community agrees to change the 21 million limit they can,” he posted on X. I wrote an entire article on tail emission: https://t.co/ChNUpifYUo Obviously, if the community agrees to change the 21 million limit they can. — Peter Todd (@peterktodd) December 19, 2024 Nevertheless, Bitcoin stakeholders agreeing to change something as fundamental to Bitcoin’s core as its fixed supply would appear to run counter to the financial incentive that exists to maintain the status quo. So why would BlackRock continue to make it an issue? Responding to criticism regarding the “silence” from Bitcoin OGs on BlackRock’s perceived misstep, Back said: “Obviously their lawyers made them write that as they sell investment products and they don’t have control.” Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2024 Decrypt Media, Inc.

Mo Shaikh, co-founder and outgoing CEO of Aptos Labs, has announced his decision to step down, marking a new chapter for the blockchain company. Shaikh, who has been deeply involved in the blockchain space since 2016, co-founded Aptos Labs three years ago with Avery Ching. Together, they aimed to create a scalable, resilient blockchain foundation to support fair and efficient products for the future. In a heartfelt post on X, Shaikh expressed his pride in what the company has achieved. Aptos has grown to become one of the most robust ecosystems in the blockchain space, trusted by over a thousand builders and innovators around the globe. The platform, which leverages the Move programming language originally developed for Facebook’s Diem project, has successfully raised $400 million in venture capital funding from top-tier investors like BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, Mastercard, Google, and PayPal. Shaikh acknowledged the contributions of early builders and partners who have helped shape the ecosystem, including Merkle Trade, Thala Labs, Kyd Labs, Econia, MyCo, and Aave, among others. He emphasized the importance of the collaboration between Web3 and Web2, which Aptos is at the forefront of driving. Reflecting on his departure, Shaikh noted his true passion for building companies from the ground up and the pride he feels in Aptos Labs’ world-class team. While stepping back from the daily operations, he will remain a strategic advisor to the company and continue to support its mission as Aptos’ most established layer-1 blockchain. Over the coming months, Shaikh plans to take time to reflect on the future of blockchain technology and explore ways to evolve financial systems to maintain Aptos’ leading role in the space. As Aptos enters its next phase of growth, Ching will take over as the CEO, a decision Shaikh says he is confident will drive the company towards even greater success. In his own post, Ching expressed excitement and determination to lead Aptos Labs into its next phase of growth. “Supporting and growing the ambitious Aptos builders and community, pushing the boundaries of innovation in Web3 technology, and high-velocity pioneering products are my immediate priorities,” Ching wrote. The start of Ching’s leadership marks a new era for Aptos, as the company aims to continue driving innovation and scaling possibilities across the ecosystem. Notably, Shaikh’s departure and Ching’s appointment come at a pivotal time for Aptos, as it remains at the cutting edge of blockchain technology, poised to shape the future of decentralized finance.

Title: Could Bitcoin Become DeFi’s Collateral of Choice? Lombard Finance Says So
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2024/12/20/could-bitcoin-become-de-fi-s-collateral-of-choice-lombard-finance-says-so
Time Published: 2024-12-19T22:12:03Z

A war for on-chain market dominance may be brewing. The question: What will be the collateral of choice in the decentralized finance (DeFi) economy? As of press time, DeFi protocols across all ecosystems have locked in almost $126 billion in value, according to DeFiLlama data, inching closer every day to their 2021 high of $175 billion. The majority of those pledged funds take the form of ether (ETH) and derivatives like yield-producing staked ether liquid tokens (stETH) and wrapped eETH (weETH), with wrapped bitcoin (wBTC) and stablecoins as a whole competing for fourth and fifth place. But the team behind Bitcoin-based DeFi protocol Lombard Finance intends to shake things up with LBTC, a new liquid bitcoin token. The idea, according to Lombard co-founder Jacob Philips, is to dethrone ETH and stETH and install bitcoin as the collateral of choice in the entire on-chain economy. “On centralized venues, bitcoin is the prime collateral. There's no question about this. Why is it not the case in DeFi?” Philips told CoinDesk in an interview. “Bitcoin only does one thing well, and it's being a rock-solid store of value. It is the perfect collateral. There's no reason that we shouldn't be building DeFi on top of bitcoin.” Bitcoin has had a formidable year, surging 124% since January 1 thanks to political tailwinds in the U.S. and the massive success of its almost year-old spot exchange-traded funds. Ether, for its part, has underperformed significantly by “only” rising 48% in the same period of time, despite being four times smaller in terms of market capitalization. With demand for bitcoin increasing by the day — and ever-increasing chatter about a potential U.S. strategic bitcoin reserve under the incoming Trump administration — it isn’t crazy to think the asset could play a bigger role on-chain. That, in turn, could transform the way DeFi as a whole operates. “Bitcoin is going to be the next big source of liquidity for every DeFi protocol, on every chain. It’s just a massive influx of net new capital,” Philips said. Noting that bitcoin has a market cap close to $1.9 trillion, he said: “Even if we only get a fraction of that, it would still put a ton of new activity into the ecosystem and make DeFi more efficient — maybe even get to the point where DeFi protocols, through passive liquidity, rival the liquidity on centralized exchanges.” A big difference between bitcoin and ether is that you can lock in the latter asset on the Ethereum network — a process called staking — to help secure the blockchain, and earn interest, paid in ETH. At press time, staked ether offers a 3.19% yield annually, according to CoinDesk's composite ether staking rate (CESR) index. The Bitcoin network doesn’t offer such capabilities, but Lombard aims to provide a yield-bearing bitcoin token through Babylon, a protocol designed to let users stake bitcoin in order to secure other blockchains. It goes like this: Users give Lombard some bitcoin, Lombard stakes these coins through Babylon, then it mints one LBTC token for each BTC staked. These LBTC tokens follow the ERC-20 standard, meaning they can be used across Ethereum and all of its protocols. That interest rate on LBTC will be paid by the blockchains secured through Babylon, or so the theory goes. Nine different projects — Corn, BOB, Cosmos Hub, Nubit, Fiamma, Manta, LayerEdge, Chakra and Pell — have started or completed integration to Babylon’s blockchain development environment, or devnet, so far, Coleman Maher, growth lead at Babylon, told CoinDesk. These integrations should go live next year, after Babylon’s own layer 1 goes live. Babylon isn’t giving out any staking rewards right now, but that hasn’t prevented the protocol from accumulating $5.4 billion in value, making it the 10th biggest protocol by value locked across all of DeFi, according to DeFiLlama. So why are people so eager to lock up their bitcoin on Babylon? Possibly because it’s running a points program, meaning that early depositors could eventually receive an airdrop. The Babylon team did not comment on whether a token would ever be issued. Out of the $6 billion staked on Babylon, over $1.4 billion was plugged through Lombard to create LBTC tokens. In the absence of Babylon-issued staking rewards, these tokens aren’t providing any yield yet. “Users aren't choosing to hold ether or bitcoin based on staking yield alone,” Philips said. “There are much broader reasons why they're choosing one or the other," such as the potential U.S. bitcoin reserve and regulators’ views towards the two assets. "And the yield is a little bit of a cherry on top.” It’s important to note that DeFi users already can use bitcoin as collateral (although without any yield) thanks to wrapped bitcoin. At press time, wBTC’s market capitalization stood at $12.9 billion. That’s only 22% away from its 2021 all-time-high, despite concerns that wBTC’s issuer, crypto custody and trading firm BitGo, is sharing custody of the underlying bitcoin with BiT Global, an entity partially owned by TRON founder Justin Sun. Sun has been accused of fraud and market manipulation in the U.S. Even so, as of December 6, wBTC only accounted for $5.7 billion worth of collateral in some of the largest DeFi protocols, per Lido data, whereas $14.5 billion in ETH was being used, and $11.1 billion worth of stETH. Even "wrapped ether," or eETH — a relatively new liquid token that allows users to benefit from EigenLayer restaking rewards at the same time as native ETH staking yield — provided $5.8 billion in collateral. In fact, stETH and weETH have been slowly eating into other coins’ market share, to the point that ARK Invest stated in a recent report that the entire DeFi economy was reorganizing itself around stETH and the benchmark yield provided by staked ETH. Other tokens — like Solana’s SOL or Avalanche’s AVAX — offer higher interest rates for staking, the implication being that these assets, being more volatile, are riskier to hold in the long run. Stablecoin lenders have also felt pressure from stETH’s ascent, ARK Invest said, with Sky (SKY) (formerly MakerDAO) increasing locked DAI’s interest rate, while rewards for lending stablecoins on Aave (AAVE) and Compound (COMP) have grown, because users would rather lend stETH and borrow stablecoins than lend stablecoins directly. Not to mention the various tokenized money market funds being developed by financial giants such as BlackRock and Franklin Templeton, which could end up allowing DeFi users to gain exposure to U.S. Treasury bills and use such tokens as collateral. So LBTC is facing tough competition. But Philips says the token can succeed where wBTC has struggled thanks to that extra little push afforded by its yield. “Staking yield will be generated in time. The LBTC yield is expected to be in the range of the ETH staking rate,” he said. “Lombard’s initial goal is just to get people to take their bitcoin out of the coldest of cold storage, and just take the most primitive step into on-chain finance. And then we'll show you the battle-tested protocols, safer than your bank, that exist out there,” Philips added. “It's possible that the yield could dry up. LBTC as an asset, producing any amount of yield, would still be an attractive asset.” The pitch has certainly been met with interest. Lombard raised $16 million this summer from a number of heavy-hitters, including Polychain Capital, Franklin Templeton and Nomad Capital. Philips said that entities already familiar with DeFi had been the most enthusiastic. “Anybody who has dabbled in crypto already, it's an easy pitch to get them onboard for bitcoin staking. Or at least they're very open to the conversation.” Tom was sucked into crypto in 2020 and is very much enjoying the ride. Now a markets reporter for CoinDesk, he previously wrote for DL News about bitcoin ETFs, the Federal Reserve, bitcoin mining and crypto adoption in Latin America.

Title: Jim Cramer on Eli Lilly and Company (LLY): ‘I See Things Going Back To Normal For Eli Lilly’

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 6 Stocks Jim Cramer Talked About This Week. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer talked about this week. Jim Cramer, host of Mad Money, recently reflected on how investors often overlook obvious opportunities, particularly with cult stocks, which in hindsight appear to be clear success stories. He discussed how, sometimes, the fundamentals that guide traditional investing can hold investors back from seizing these opportunities. Cramer acknowledged that many investors, himself included, have missed out on these types of stocks and emphasized that it’s important to examine why these opportunities were missed to avoid making the same mistake again. He mentioned that, early on, he and others mistakenly believed that fundamentals were always the key to making sound investments, only to realize that in certain situations, that’s not the case. Cramer highlighted that in the case of cult stocks, the stock price can sometimes move independently of the company’s underlying performance. These stocks can experience long-term growth due to a fiercely loyal shareholder base, and as a result, they may not follow traditional market behavior. He explained that while meme stocks might follow similar trends, cult stocks have staying power and can defy expectations. “There’s a lesson here and it is a brutal one. Sometimes conventional methods of valuation are completely worthless, and you need to embrace the dynamics of cult stocks. The trick is to recognize when we’re in one of those moments. In 2025, let’s strive to find the stocks of companies that do defy orthodoxy.” READ ALSO Jim Cramer’s Lightning Round: 7 Stocks to Watch and Jim Cramer’s Game Plan for This Week: 8 Stocks in Focus Shifting the focus to the healthcare sector, Cramer noted that although the market has seen significant gains in recent weeks, it has become increasingly difficult to find promising investment opportunities. However, he believes that healthcare could be the place to look as 2025 approaches. Cramer explained that healthcare stocks have significantly underperformed this year, trailing behind the broader market, which has created an opportunity. “Now, it's hard to bet on healthcare when the Fed's cutting rates because these are textbook slowdown stocks and thrived when the economy was not doing so hot, but the election was also a clear negative catalyst for the group.” He noted that President-elect Trump’s potential appointment of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to head the Department of Health and Human Services is a major concern for the industry, especially given Kennedy’s reputation as a vaccine skeptic. Cramer also warned that if the second Trump administration attempts to dismantle Obamacare, it could lead to many Americans losing access to affordable health insurance, which would add further risk to healthcare stocks. Despite these concerns, Cramer believes that, at some point, all the negative factors will be factored into healthcare stocks, and that moment is fast approaching. He stated that the damage done to healthcare stocks, particularly in biotech and pharmaceuticals, has been severe, but he sees an opportunity as these stocks have become too cheap relative to their long-term potential. “With so many groups hitting new highs, I think it's worth taking a step back and putting money to work in one of the most hated groups out there, healthcare. These stocks have simply gotten too cheap given its prospects, especially Eli Lilly, Vertex Pharma, and Bristol-Myers.” Our Methodology For this article, we compiled a list of 6 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the recent episode of Mad Money on December 16. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the third quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). An array of pharmaceutical pills with the company's logo on the bottle. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 106 Cramer noted that Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) is being careful with its promotion and predicted that the company will be back to its full strength soon enough. “Eli Lilly is at the top of the list. Now we own this one for the Charitable Trust and it's earned, it’s nearly [at] $740 billion market cap. But with the stock in the high $700s, it has pulled back almost 20% from its highs in late August. As recently as late October, this stock was still sitting in the low $900s. But Lilly got hit real hard after reporting a seemingly not-so-hot quarter. And then it got hit again after the election, reportedly on an idea that RFK Jr. is not a fan of GLP-1 weight loss drugs like Lilly's Mounjaro. Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY), a leading global pharmaceutical company, is recognized for its extensive range of treatments, particularly in the areas of diabetes and obesity. The company has gained significant attention for its diabetes medication Mounjaro and its companion drug for chronic weight management, Zepbound. These products have rapidly become key drivers of its growth. Reporting its third quarter, the company stated that U.S. sales of both Mounjaro and Zepbound were impacted negatively due to a reduction in inventories within the wholesaler channel. It should be noted that the sales of both drugs were still strong. Mounjaro alone was responsible for 27.3% of the total revenue, reflecting a remarkable 121% growth compared to the same quarter in the previous year. Zepbound also made a substantial impact, accounting for more than 11% of the revenue in that period. The company’s CFO, Lucas Montarce, mentioned during the earnings call that wholesalers had reduced inventories of diabetes and obesity medications, describing this as a temporary issue. Looking ahead to 2024, Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) revised its earnings forecast, expecting a non-GAAP EPS between $13.02 and $13.52, down from its prior projection of $16.10 to $16.60. This change is largely due to the acquisition of Morphic Holdings. Lastly, the company is anticipating data from late-stage trials on its experimental obesity pill, orforglipron, with results expected in April 2025, according to a top executive at the company. The pill belongs to a class of medications called incretins, which are designed to replicate the effects of the GLP-1 hormone. This hormone helps control blood sugar levels, slows the rate at which food leaves the stomach, and reduces appetite. Overall LLY ranks 2nd on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer talked about this week. While we acknowledge the potential of LLY as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Title: Micron (MU) Tumbles after Guidance Comes in Way Below the Street’s Outlook

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. The shares of Micron (MU) are sinking 16% after the company provided significantly weaker-than-expected guidance for its current quarter. Micron develops and markets computer memory products. In fiscal Q2, the company's current quarter, the company expects its adjusted earnings per share to come in at $1.33 to $1.53. Analysts' average estimate was $1.92. Similarly, Micron predicted that it would generate Q2 sales of $7.7 billion to $8.1 billion, versus the mean estimate of $9 billion. Further, it provided adjusted gross margin guidance for Q2 of 37.5%-39.5%, versus analysts' average estimate of 41.3%. Micron blamed the guidance misses on weak consumer-oriented markets. The company's chips are widely utilized in PCs and cell phones. However, CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said that the firm is "exceptionally well positioned to leverage AI-driven growth to create substantial value for all stakeholders.” For Q1, its previous quarter, Micron generated adjusted EPS of $1.79, versus analysts' mean outlook of $1.77. Additionally, its sales soared 84% year-over-year, driven by high demand for its products from data centers and the strong performance of its high-bandwidth memory offerings. However, many banks cut their price targets on MU stock in the wake of the guidance misses. Bank of America, for example, lowered its rating on the shares to Neutral from Buy and slashed its price target on the shares to $110 from $125. The bank reported that there is "downward pressure" on prices for Micron's memory products due to "weakness in PC and phone markets." While we acknowledge the potential of MU, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Title: Crypto And Digital Assets Shine At ADFW24: Abu Dhabi, the Capital Of Capital Connectors

ADFW24 Main Stage In its third iteration, Abu Dhabi Finance Week (ADFW) 2024, saw over 20,000 conference delegates, twice the number of 2023, convene from December 9 to 11 at the Abu Dhabi Global Markets (ADGM) campus at ADGM Square on Al Maryah Island in Abu Dhabi. ADFW convenes many of the world’s innovative capitalists from banking, asset management, and fintech on par with Davos or Milken’s LA Conference. The number of events running across the week covered themes like economics, capital markets, blockchain, investment, fintech, family offices, sustainable investing, and Islamic Finance, to name a few. Speakers included the chief executives of Blackrock, Morgan Stanley, HSBC, Citigroup, BNY, Lunate, First Abu Dhabi Bank (FAB) and Aldar. Monday of the conference, the first day, is a veritable who's who to rub shoulders with on the intimate ADGM campus while recovering from the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix F1 celebrations the evening before. In addition to the cadre of CEOs, legends like Ray Dalio can be found circulating alongside rising statesmen like Eric Trump, grabbing the attention of many for selfies. Trump's crisp and eloquent narrative on the utility of bitcoin as a strategic reserve to be used to pay down national debt in both open and closed door sessions also impressed many. ADFW24 saw eight global institutions, representing $635 billion announce they are setting up shop in Abu Dhabi, building on the $450 billion in commitments during last year’s ADFW23, and confirming ADGM’s status as the region’s fastest growing global financial centre. H.E. Ahmed Jasim Al Zaabi, Member of Abu Dhabi’s Executive Council & Chairman of the Abu Dhabi Department of Economic Development (ADDED) and ADGM commented, “These milestones reflect the heart of what makes Abu Dhabi so special—a shared vision of progress, partnership, and possibility. The growing number of global financial leaders and innovators choosing ADGM is a testament to the trust they place in our infrastructure, robust regulations, commitment to excellence and Abu Dhabi’s reputation as the world’s safest and most dynamic jurisdiction for asset and wealth management. "As we welcome these new partnerships, we remain dedicated to driving the growth and diversification of the ‘Falcon Economy’ and creating opportunities that resonate across industries and borders. It’s an exciting moment for ADGM, Abu Dhabi, and all those who are part of this remarkable journey.” Chris Hughes, the editor-in-chief of ADFW, and his team must take a bow again this year on another outstanding ADFW, which grows from strength to strength. Hughes kicked off the afternoon session on the first day of the conference with a video interview with Larry Fink, chairman and ceo of Blackrock, recorded for the event. On this year's growth of ADGM, Fink commented, “It's been a long journey watching how Abu Dhabi has matured as an economy. The constant innovation that I'm seeing from the economy and from the leadership. And Abu Dhabi has really positioned itself to become a leader over the next 20 years. Its psychology was different, and now it's blossoming into this magnet of opportunity. With that strength, it is now becoming a foundation for innovation.” Hughes followed with a live fireside chat with Jaap Kalkman, the group chief investment officer of ADQ, one of the Emirates three sovereign wealth funds which include Mubadala and Adia, collectively managing $1.7 trillion in assets - Abu Dhabi is ranked as the world's the top city for sovereign wealth fund capital. ADQ has launched a new report, "A New Era of Capital Flows in a Polycentric World", in collaboration with ADFW and ADGM, and with Stern at NYU Abu Dhabi serving as academic advisor. The report explores the idea that the world is on the brink of a new era of capital flows. What is clear from listening to policymakers and asset allocators at ADFW is that Abu Dhabi is positioning the hub as a connector to the world's major financial centres. Hughes, one of the most connected people in the global financial services sector, said, "2024 was quite a year. Starting with Global Roadshows to far away places like the US, China, France, Switzerland, U.K. and more, to an unprecedented influx of investors setting up in the Capital, we finished the year by producing the breakout launch edition of Abu Dhabi Business Week for 12,500 people, and the biggest ever edition of Abu Dhabi Finance Week." There were a number of announcements that caught the attention of the global blockchain community. With the Bitcoin Mena conference running at the same time down the road and CZ popping in for a visit, the prevalence of crypto and digital assets left its mark on ADFW. Many market pundits have concluded that stablecoins are the the killer app in digital assets delivering the fiat on and off ramps to Web3.0. Paxos announced it has partnered with Standard Chartered to strengthen supporting the Global Dollar (USDG) and Lift Dollar (USDL) in Singapore and the UAE. Adam Ackermann, head of treasury and portfolio management at Paxos, said: “As the stablecoin industry continues to attract the world’s leading enterprises, it’s more important than ever to ensure they have access to sophisticated, institutional-grade products. Standard Chartered’s commitment to risk management, compliance and operational efficiency across its world-class banking solutions is critical to Paxos as a regulated stablecoin issuer.“ Circle announced plans for expansion and partnership with Binance on USDC to accelerate crypto adoption and their MENA hub in Abu Dhabi. Commenting on the partnership, Dante Disparte, chief strategy officer and head of global policy at Circle, said, "The partnership demonstrates the maturation of our industry, with the world's largest crypto exchange, Binance, with 250 million end users, and USDC, the world's most trusted regulated digital dollar." ADGM Polygon Labs announced a collaboration focused on developing international disclosure standards that ensure transparency, security, and trust within the Web3 and broader blockchain ecosystem. Rebecca Rettig, Peter Kerstens, Elise Soucie Watts. and Lawrence Wintermeyer Rebecca Rettig, of Polygon Labs commented, "It's been pretty amazing to work with the government here, and see how they are thinking about things, both to have regulatory guard rails, and to have innovate companies in the space." eToro announced that has partnered with ADX, the region's stock exchange, to expand investment opportunities in the UAE. eToro’s users will be able to invest in a number of ADX-listed companies across various sectors, including energy, real estate, banking, finance, technology, and healthcare. ADX is one of the world’s fastest-growing exchanges that ranks among the top 20 globally in terms of market capitalization. Yoni Assia, co-founder and ceo at eToro, commented, “We are excited to announce our partnership with the Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange, enabling eToro users to trade ADX-listed stocks. Since our founding in 2007, we’ve built a global, multi-asset investment offering and today offer our users from 75 countries the ability to trade in equities from more than 20 stock exchanges.” Fintech.TV and Finstreet are joining forces to empower investors with the knowledge and insights necessary to navigate the complexities of today's financial markets.

Fintstreet received its ADGM green light to launch a blockchain platform for digital multilateral trading facility (MTF), central securities depository, and a private financing platform in September. Zodia Markets got the green light during ADFW24 and was granted permission to operate as a regulated virtual asset brokerage in ADGM, while the Aptos Foundation expanded into ADGM with plans to use its office as a base for expanding across the region. ADGM Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA), the progressive Emirates regulator, has recently announced new frameworks dedicated to crypto and digital assets. The FSRA is run by ceo Emmanuel Givanakis, a 10 year veteran of ADGM with a pedigree in policy and law, and an eye for innovation in conduct regulators. The FSRA's former ceo is Richard Teng, now the ceo of Binance. Givanakis commented, "We have recently released our fiat-reference token framework which is a stablecoin framework, we have a lot of firms from North America wanting to issue stablecoins from ADGM. This week, we have come out with a consultation paper for our virtual asset framework, and how we are going to enhance it.

Title: Cramer Impressed by GE Vernova (GEV) Performance Post-Spin-Off Amid Clean Energy Demand

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 14 Stocks That Jim Cramer Recently Talked About. In this article, we are going to take a look at where GE Vernova Inc. (NYSE:GEV) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer recently talked about. In his latest appearance on CNBC’s Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer continued to talk about the incoming Trump administration’s tariffs. Coupled with the Fed’s data-driven interest rates cycle, tariffs have created quite a stir on Wall Street as investors are wary of them contributing to inflationary pressures and making the central bank hesitate when it comes to reducing rates. He believes that one of the key issues surrounding tariffs is the interconnection between the US and China. Cramer shared that “I know many business people have talked to President-elect Trump and they’ve said, ‘It’s not as simple as steel. Steel’s a hundred thousand people, I mean some of these companies have three hundred, four hundred thousand people themselves. I think the problem is we’re so intertwined and a lot of people felt, you know what, when President Trump, or when he was President Trump, you basically felt you were supposed to go from China to Mexico. Seemed like a good deal. And Mexico seemed like, favored.” Since then, Cramer shared that the sentiment around Mexico has changed. According to him, the same people are now wondering “Why did we go to this country that apparently doesn’t like.” He also shed light on the relationship between China and Mexico and shared that “China and Mexico are strange bedfellows. China’s been flooding the country with autos! And, what we did was we moved all of our auto production down there! Also Germany, you go to Puebla, and it’s Volkswagen!” He added that this makes implementing tariffs tricky as “it’s just that the cars go back and forth, and back and forth, where, where do we put the tariff on? Where to we take it off?” However, while the market might be worried about the broader impact of tariffs, businesses are also excited about growing merger and acquisition activity. Cramer outlined that “very quickly, people just say, you know what, look, tariffs are so convoluted that something has to happen. But the idea that they can talk to other companies and maybe combine, they want that so badly.” Apart from his takes on stocks, some of Cramer’s most controversial views are of cryptocurrencies. While he doesn’t advocate completely shunning them, the tight-knit crypto community either panics when he’s bullish for Bitcoin due to the well-known inverse Cramer effect or wonders why he doesn’t advocate holding more crypto as part of a portfolio. In a recent episode of Mad Money, Cramer shared some of his latest thoughts about crypto: “I’ve always endorsed keeping up to 10% of your portfolio in gold as a kind of insurance against the world’s lunacy. But for years now, I’ve also been saying Bitcoin’s a fine alternative to gold for that 10% position. Why not? I think the federal budget deficit is at impossible levels. I don’t want to be wedded to a currency backed by the full faith and credit of a country that owes $36 trillion.” Cramer reiterated that there’s more to investing than simply “just owning cryptocurrencies.” In fact, he believes that buying stocks can potentially lead to an investor making more money than buying cryptocurrencies. “Bitcoin’s part of the most obviously diversified portfolio in recent history,” believes Cramer. “Buying and holding stocks can be just as lucrative as buying Bitcoin six days after Biden dropped out of the race. Or maybe, just maybe, it can make you even more money.” Another Mad Money episode saw him stress that he has held Bitcoin for years as Cramer shared: “I want to discuss Bitcoin, really. I do—not to the detriment of stocks but in addition to stocks. I come to praise Bitcoin, not buy it. First, let’s dispel the idea that I’ve never believed in Bitcoin. Now, if you search YouTube, you can see that I first bought Bitcoin on September 15, 2020, when it was at just over $10,000.” To make our list of stocks that Jim Cramer is talking about, we listed down stocks he commented on during at latest episode of CNBC’s Squawk on the Street and tweeted about. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). Copyright: bee32 / 123RF Stock Photo Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 89 GE Vernova Inc. (NYSE:GEV) is a fresh company formed after the spin-off of General Electric’s energy division earlier this year. Since the spin-off, the shares have gained 157% to make it one of the best-performing stocks of the year. Cramer referred to GE Vernova Inc. (NYSE:GEV) as part of his remarks for Honeywell as he was impressed by the firm’s performance after the split. GE Vernova Inc. (NYSE:GEV) benefits from the growing demand for clean energy, particularly from AI data centers. The firm has been focused on refocusing efforts away from its wind generation business to better cater to the rising demand for clean energy. Commenting on GE Vernova Inc. (NYSE:GEV), Cramer shared that the firm’s CEO benefited from its surprising exposure to data centers: “Well he got the break that Vernonva turned out to be data center. A data center. But then you have to go throw cold water on it.” Overall, GEV ranks 6th on our list of stocks that Jim Cramer recently talked about. While we acknowledge the potential of GEV as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GEV but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

(NASDAQ:MRNA) is the embattled biotechnology company that rose to global fame during the coronavirus pandemic. The firm’s fall from grace is the sharpest example you’ll find of the tough conditions in its industry. Pharma firms spend billions of dollars and years developing drugs. The heavy time and money investment means that their drugs have to generate value for years as well in order to recover costs and create space for developing new treatments. However, Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) has struggled since the coronavirus pandemic. It is aggressively investing in R&D, with TTM expenses being $4.8 billion. While investing in growth is good, the spending is just $200 million short of the firm’s revenue. Cramer isn’t too happy with Moderna, Inc.

We recently published a list of the 10 Best Growth Stocks To Invest In Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) stands against other best growth stocks. Is a December rally in store for stocks in 2024? Some investors are expecting a surge in stocks from the 24th of December to the 3rd of January, 2025, also referred to as the Santa Claus Rally. On December 17, Ryan Detric, Chief Market Strategist at Carson Group, Joined Catalysts on Yahoo Finance to discuss whether he expects December to be a record-breaking month for the stock market. Historically, the first half of December is usually slow for the stock market, while the second half is faster, suggested Detric. He also added that compared to election years in the past, this December has been very “flattish” so far. He also suggested that the Fed is going to continue the easing cycle and with the CPI declining, the current market conditions are favorable. Detrick then added that despite macroeconomic conditions and the performance of the Dow Jones index recently, he expects to see a record surge this month and expects “Santa Claus” to make an appearance this year. Since the elections, stocks have been rallying with high hopes for the future. On December 18, Dan Ives, Managing Director at Wedbush Securities, joined Market Domination on Yahoo Finance to discuss his outlook on Big Tech and the new administration. Ives emphasized that the autonomous robotics and disruptive technologies sectors are going to benefit strongly from the new administration and its policies, despite concerns over tariffs. He also discussed the growing relationship between the new administration and Elon Musk, and how the two parties “need each other” to thrive, suggesting that Musk’s company has solid growth potential in the coming year and AI innovation will strengthen the collaboration immensely. He also added that the environment is extremely bullish for Big Tech and expects growth in the coming year. Ives shared that while there are a few road bumps, especially from the Chinese market, the environment in retrospect is positive. Speaking of the electric vehicle market, he emphasized that new policies in the US coupled with international consolidation, especially in Europe and Asia, will benefit EV makers in the United States immensely. The expectations from growth stocks are immense as the AI revolution takes precedence. To come up with the 10 best growth stocks to invest in now, we went over multiple rankings on the internet to compile an initial list of growth stocks. We then examined the hedge fund sentiment of each stock and picked the most popular ones. Our list is in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders as of Q3 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). An engineer in a lab coat examining a state-of-the-art semiconductor chip. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 158 Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), a chip maker for technology giants like NVIDIA and AMD, attributes its revenue growth to the increasing demand for artificial intelligence. In the third quarter of 2024, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) logged revenue worth $23.7 billion (NT$759.69 billion) and net income worth $10.13 billion (NT$325.26 billion), up by 39% and 54.2% year-over-year, respectively. Its advanced microprocessors have fueled business for TSMC immensely, keeping the hopes up of investors, especially after ASML cut down guidance. On October 17, TECHnalysis Research president and chief analyst, Bob O’Donnell, appeared on Yahoo Finance to discuss the position of TSMC. He shared that ASML cutting its guidance has more to do with challenges in China and much less with the semiconductor industry. He added that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) posted a solid financial performance, emphasizing that the company beat earnings and raised its guidance for 2025, suggesting that TSMC is a “much better bellwether” of AI. Overall, TSMC expects its four-year revenue to increase by nearly 30% due to the growing demand for artificial intelligence. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) also plans to spend nearly $32 billion to $40 billion in capital expenditures in 2024 and expects revenue from AI chips to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 50% by 2027. Baron Global Advantage Fund stated the following regarding Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “We established a small position in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM). Morris Chang founded TSMC in 1987, as the world’s first dedicated semiconductor foundry. Until then, semiconductor chips were always designed and manufactured by the same company. TSMC introduced a groundbreaking new business model, in which it acted purely as a contract manufacturer, which proved to be highly successful. TSMC maintained a focus on improving its manufacturing process technology and enabled the emergence of innovative fabless design companies, including NVIDIA, Apple, and Qualcomm, who became TSMC’s key customers. Today, TSMC has a more than 60% share of the total semiconductor foundry market and over 90% share in leading-edge manufacturing. TSMC enjoys high barriers to entry given the ever-increasing cost and technological complexity of semiconductor manufacturing while benefiting from economies of scope as once leading-edge manufacturing becomes lagging edge on fully depreciated equipment. TSMC also benefits from scale– higher profits lead to higher R&D and capex investments, allowing for further technological differentiation, resulting in more profits. We believe TSMC will sustain strong double-digit earnings growth for years to come, driven by continued market share gains, strong pricing power, and structural growth in AI demand. According to C.C. Wei, TSMC’s CEO, “almost all the AI innovators are working with TSMC to address the insatiable AI-related demand.”6 Management forecasts that revenue from server AI chips, such as GPUs and other AI accelerators, will grow at a 50% CAGR from 2022 to 2028 and account for more than 20% of TSMC’s revenue by 2028. We except further long-term upside from the eventual proliferation of edge AI devices, including AI smartphones and AI PCs, which will require significantly more computing power and drive even stronger demand for TSMC’s leading-edge technology.” Overall, TSM ranks 6th on our list of the best growth stocks to invest in. While we acknowledge the potential of TSM to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than TSM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: BlackRock’s iShares ETF Makes History with Unique Blockchain-Backed Municipal Debt Deal
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/blackrocks-ishares-etf-makes-history-blockchain/
Time Published: 2024-12-19T18:30:05Z
Full Content:
On Wednesday, BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, successfully acquired municipal debt through a transaction that exclusively utilizes blockchain technology. According to a Bloomberg report, this marks the first instance of municipal bonds being purchased, settled, and held entirely on a blockchain platform. Per the report, the bonds were issued earlier this year by the city of Quincy, Massachusetts, and were underwritten by JPMorgan Chase & Co. The transaction was facilitated through an application on JPMorgan’s private, permissioned blockchain platform, known as Digital Debt Service. Interestingly, this approach not only streamlines the bond issuance process but also enhances transparency and security in municipal finance. BlackRock’s acquisition was made through its actively-managed exchange-traded fund, the iShares Short Maturity Municipal Bond Active ETF (MEAR). Since its inception in 2015, MEAR has attracted approximately $750 million in client assets. As part of this historic deal, BlackRock has taken a total position of $6.5 million in the Quincy bonds, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Pat Haskell, head of BlackRock’s municipal bond group, expressed optimism about the transaction, stating: The use of blockchain throughout the lifecycle of bonds is just one example of the potential for this technology to transform capital markets. This transaction marks a significant moment for the municipal bond market and is a testament to BlackRock’s dedication to innovation. The prospectus for MEAR was recently updated to permit the fund to invest in municipal bonds settled through JPMorgan’s blockchain application, as indicated in a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission dated December 17. However, investors are cautioned about potential risks, including lack of liquidity and the possibility of errors or limitations inherent in the underlying computer code of the application. In recent years, several issuers and underwriters have explored the feasibility of blockchain technology in the municipal bond market. Notably, the board of trustees at Michigan State University considered a deal that would have utilized a proprietary digital assets platform developed by Goldman Sachs, highlighting a growing interest in integrating blockchain solutions within traditional finance. In the realm of cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs), BlackRock has garnered significant attention, particularly due to ongoing inflows throughout the year. Notably, its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has outperformed its gold ETF in terms of assets under management (AUM). According to Ki Young Ju, CEO of the market intelligence firm CryptoQuant, it took BlackRock’s gold ETF 20 years to reach $33 billion in AUM. In contrast, the Bitcoin ETF has nearly doubled that figure in less than a year, approaching the $60 billion milestone. This development occurs amid notable volatility in Bitcoin’s price over the past 48 hours, as traders anticipated the US Federal Reserve’s decision on interest rate cuts. During this period, despite Bitcoin briefly falling below the $100,000 mark, BlackRock seized the opportunity to purchase $1 billion worth of Bitcoin. At the time of writing, despite losing the key $100,000 milestone, Bitcoin has managed to recover this level and is currently trading at $101,240. However, the market’s leading crypto still posted losses of 2.3% in the 24-hour time frame. Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Blackstone released its first satirical holiday video in 2018 as a way to liven up employees' spirits in lieu of the company-wide holiday party, a tradition that was canceled because the firm had grown too large. Now, it's a viral sensation. Eight million people have viewed last year's video featuring Blackstone executives doing their best to match the success of Taylor Swift's Eras Tour with a pop song about alternative investments. It made headlines, with the Daily Mail questioning whether it was "the most cringeworthy corporate video ever." This year, the company doubled down on the singing (and introduced line-dancing) in its most ambitious (and outlandish) holiday video yet. It also featured 200 employees, up from just 20 in 2018, a testiment to the video's popularity within the firm. Jay Gillespie, Blackstone's head of video, joked that his role in producing the video has made him a hot commodity at 345 Park Avenue. "People come up to me throughout the year, and they're like, 'My daughter is helping me rehearse so I might get a line next year,'" Gillespie told Business Insider. "People are really into lobbying to be in it." If you don't get it, don't worry. We decided to help readers save time by watching and reviewing all of the firm's videos going back to 2018. This video came out in December 2020, during the depths of the pandemic. It stuck to the theme it launched in 2018 of depicting Blackstone as a version of the NBC sitcom "The Office," but executives wore face masks and pandemic jokes featured prominently. In an early scene one Blackstone executive has a hard time recognizing a colleague with out-of-control long hair. (Remember when all the barber shops were closed?) While it was a bleak time, the video ends on an upbeat note, with Blackstone employees cutting loose to "I'm Walking on Sunshine," kicking off the tradition of holiday video songs, which have featured prominently since. Still, it's a bit stuck in the pandemic era, hence its place at No. 7. The conceit of this holiday season is fake news station "BX TV News" prompting Jon Gray to search for Blackstone's secret sauce. (It was a roundabout way for the firm to tout its plan to hit $1 trillion assets under management, which it has since achieved.) Schwarzman returns to a role he often plays in these videos as the sincere elder statesman to explain that the firm's true secret sauce is its employees. But then, he notes that there is a secret hidden in the basement, setting two executives on an Indiana-Jones-referencing journey to find the scroll with the firm's secret. This weird twist is the highlight of the video. The video successfully makes a number of self-deprecating jokes about Blackstone's love of acronyms (BCRED, anyone?) and Wall Street's notorious work hours. By 2022, however, the company has been going with "The Office" theme for four years, hence its ranking. The budget for the holiday video clearly increased this year, with a storyline about the birth of BX TV, the firm's weekly video call that Gray is incredibly enthusiastic about (and employees, less so). There are animals, special effects, and a Reese Witherspoon cameo. The key joke is a fake award ceremony where Gray receives "'Best Weekly Internal Zoom Call at an Alternative Asset Management firm." The hope is that it will convince the firm's president and chief operating officer that it's time to move on with John Finley, chief legal officer, saying, "I make one call to the FCC and they'll cancel this clown car."Employees chant "end it," and celebrate as they think Gray has decided to cancel the show after winning the award. But instead, it's clear that 2022's BX TV season is already being planned, and the internal video call is still a weekly requirement at the firm. Scranton, Pennsylvania, is a long way from Park Avenue in Midtown Manhattan, and Dunder Mifflin would be among its smallest portfolio companies, yet Blackstone successfully riffed off the NBC sitcom "The Office" for its first annual holiday video. The video begins with the theme music from the television show, and like "The Office," there is hand-held camera work and plenty of "candid" interviews with executives. There's also a Michael Scott look-alike. As with all the holiday videos that follow, this one starts with Jon Gray calling his executive assistant, Laurie Carlson. This video started it all and set the tone for Blackstone's trademark style of mixing the firm's reality with jokes. The premise of the video is that Blackstone canceled its holiday party and replaced it with a video, which actually happened. And Jon Gray really does, sometimes, act a bit like Michael Scott in his enthusiasm for wild ideas, according to people who know him. There are fewer visual gags and no Hollywood cameos, but it's a classic. The 2023's holiday video marked the first time Blackstone moved away from being a parallel version of "The Office" (only the title card remains). Instead, it's an homage to Taylor Swift and the Eras tour, with Blackstone trying to replicate her success with its own song about alternative investments. This is video that broke into the wider world, spawning more than a few mocking tabloid headlines. But for a video series that's main goal is to help the firm laugh at itself, that's a measure of success. Add that this immortal line: "Just this once, I do hope people confuse us with BlackRock." Also, you get to see Steve Schwarzman dancing while wearing some glittery fringe top. The 2019 holiday video revolves around Blackstone' absurd search for a company mascot, which turns out to be Mr. Stone, a mascot that looks like a cross of Hulk and Jon Gray. The international offices of Blackstone get cameos in this one, as does a plug for Steve Schwarzman's book, What It Takes: Lessons in the Pursuit of Excellence" Gray told BI that this was his favorite in the series because of the mascot. The firm not only hired a company to build the mascot suit, but also made dozens of bobbleheads which still show up in holiday videos, and on some people's desks. We agree that that the mascot joke works, hence its ranking. This video also ends with one of the best Steve Schwarzman gags of the series, when it's revealed that Schwarzman has been the mysterious person inside Mr. Stone the whole time. After last year's reception, leaned in to the cringe with a metaverse-like exploration of Blackstone executives as reality television stars that ends in a country song-and-dance routine. It features appearances from famous friends. Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, which was originally created within Blackstone before spinning out in the 1990s, gets in a joke about how the two firms get confused for each other. An extended "Real Housewives" bit includes some shade from Jenna Lyons, "Real Housewives of New York" star, fashion designer and executive creative director at Fundamental Co, a branding agency spun out of Blackstone last year.The highlight, however, was billionaire founder and CEO Steve Schwarzman playing Kendall Jenner attempting to cut a cucumber, which has to be one of the most mind-bending images ever put on screen. (We are still struggling to fully process it.) Gray told BI that the turn to country was inspired by Beyonce's own embrace of the genre this year on "Cowboy Carter", which came in the wake of her 2016 snub by the Country Music Awards. And just like Beyonce, some of the firm's best work comes when they don't let the critics stop them. Jump to

Title: Health Insurance Execs Should Live in Fear of Prison, Not Murder

© THE INTERCEPT ALL RIGHTS RESERVED The U.S. political system is owned by corporations despised by the American people. Luigi Mangione is the result. The murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson is a profoundly revealing moment in American politics. Not only has it opened the floodgates of public anger at health insurance companies, but it has also demonstrated just how avoidant most U.S. politicians are when it comes to acknowledging that anger or doing anything about it. The surge of online excitement surrounding the man accused of murdering Thompson, 26-year-old Luigi Mangione, is a symptom of a much larger problem: an oligarchic U.S. political system that repeatedly fails to respond to the needs of the people. In the absence of effective government, vigilante violence becomes much more likely. Mangione has found popularity precisely because the man he is accused of killing ran a company that routinely boosted profits by pushing its customers closer to illness and death. Earlier this year, a U.S. Senate committee investigated UnitedHealthcare and determined that the insurance company frequently denied nursing care to patients who were recovering from falls and strokes in order to boost its profits. Health news platform Stat reported that a UnitedHealthcare subsidiary called NaviHealth systematically denied care for seriously ill seniors. Thompson himself was facing a class-action lawsuit for insider trading amid a Department of Justice investigation. Of course, it is easy to treat UnitedHealthcare’s abuses as the actions of just one evil company run by a handful of bad men. But these companies are owned by Wall Street. Institutional investors and shareholders reward and punish corporate executives based on the profits they generate and the share prices they produce. In causing harm to so many Americans, Thompson was meeting the demands of his corporate board members and the even wealthier interests that they serve. These profits generated by denying Americans medical care are in turn converted into campaign contributions and lobbying dollars that block our political system from doing anything about it. In 2023 and 2024, UnitedHealth Group’s political action committee reported donating $2.95 million to federal campaigns and spending $16.62 million on lobbying expenses. Meanwhile, the top federal recipient of campaign contributions from UnitedHealth Group executives and employees was Kamala Harris. Perhaps this is why Harris flip-flopped on abolishing private health insurance during her first of two failed runs for president: she knew just how much money was on the table. Harris, of course, isn’t the only major recipient of campaign contributions from UnitedHealth Group employees in 2024. The Democratic National Committee received $103,022; the Republican National Committee received $207,125; and the Trump campaign took in $144,297. And UnitedHealth Group is not alone. A quick review of other major health insurance companies demonstrates that each of them has spent heavily in recent campaign cycles to maintain a political system that responds to their corporate interests, while undermining the health of the American people. Perhaps this is why prominent Democratic politicians like Pennsylvania’s Sen. John Fetterman and Gov. Josh Shapiro were so quick to condemn the murder of Thompson, while saying little or nothing about the thousands of people who have been denied coverage for their medical care by UnitedHealthcare under Thompson’s management. And perhaps this has something to do with why New York Gov. Kathy Hochul issued a statement regarding the murder of Thompson and personally joined a virtual convening of some 175 corporate representatives who were concerned about their safety, but has said nothing regarding the insurance abuses of UnitedHealthcare. With Republicans about to control all three branches of the U.S. government, any real accountability for health insurance companies, including criminalization of their abuses, is highly unlikely. But even under the best of circumstances, we shouldn’t expect much from our status quo political system. The high-water mark of health care reform in recent American history was the Affordable Care Act, or “Obamacare.” Obama’s signature achievement was originally a conservative Heritage Foundation plan previously implemented by former private equity executive Mitt Romney when he was the governor of Massachusetts. And even this market-friendly approach was later disavowed and attacked by Republicans. But despite these tremendous hurdles — or because of them — a clear public rage exists that would be foolish to ignore. For progressives seeking to reboot the Democratic Party, this is the time to turn public outrage at UnitedHealthcare into tangible pressure that breaks the back of business-as-usual. It is worth remembering just how often Republicans leverage false crises to capture the national debate. In evaluating the present moment, it is worth remembering just how often Republicans leverage false crises to capture the national debate. The hysterias over the so-called war on Christmas, transgender access to bathrooms, critical race theory, “all lives matter,” and “they’re eating the cats” are all examples of moments when conservatives have created controversies or flipped the script on real-world events to shift headlines and distract the public from the actual problems of concentrated power and wealth in America. Republicans have long been better at this than Democrats, because Republicans use their meme wars to punch down and target the powerless, while Democrats are usually too fearful to punch up and target the corporate elites who fund their campaigns while driving many of America’s ills. But unlike many Republican attacks, the problems with health insurance are real, and public concern is quite broad. A recent Economist/YouGov poll revealed that 62 percent of those polled blamed health insurance companies for problems with the health care system, and the same percentage blame corporate executives. Democrats would be foolish to let the public’s focus on UnitedHealthcare dissipate, but as the 2024 elections revealed, Democratic Party leaders have a long track record of such foolishness. Given that Republicans will soon hold a trifecta in Washington, and that many Democrats are too fearful of their paymasters to bluntly criticize the corporate classes, how can we push our political system to hold health insurers and Wall Street accountable? One answer might be found in abandoning any hope of seeking immediate redress through our legislative process. Instead we should treat health insurance companies, their dominant shareholders, and the politicians who serve them in the same way that one would treat a repressive government that one is trying to reform — or overthrow. In this context, our tools of battle become cultural delegitimization, demand radicalization, economic pressure, and (nonviolent) political war. Our goal should be to build an American political culture in which health insurance executives and their companies are viewed and treated the same way that child molesters and drug cartels are. They should be ostracized, stigmatized, and demonized. By doing so, we will shift American politics and create a more hospitable environment for pursuing the long-term accountability that health care reformers seek. This cultural delegitimization can be accomplished through a series of campaigns that target health insurance executives, demonize employment in their businesses, and create a broader negative environment in which no one wants to be associated with them. When it comes to finding opportunities to stigmatize these individuals and corporations, there are likely to be many opportunities to choose from. One recent example? Even as Thompson and UnitedHealthcare were denying sectors of the public access to valuable medical coverage, they were allowed to “sportswash” their reputations by serving as sponsors of the 2026 Special Olympics USA Games. The next time a philanthropic or community initiative unrolls a red carpet for a health insurance executive, there should be a dramatic public backlash. We must shift the Overton window far enough that legislative reforms and accountability become the moderate position in American politics. This means speaking bluntly and directly about what should happen to predatory health insurance executives, their corporations, and their enablers. Health insurance CEOs who implement denial of coverage practices to boost profits should go to jail. Health insurance companies that enable this behavior should face revocation of their corporate charters. And shareholders and investors who financially benefit from these ugly profits should be made directly and criminally liable. Finally, the thousands upon thousands of people who have been unjustly denied coverage for their medical services should be introduced to a new concept: reparations. Every entity that profits from predatory health insurance practices should be made to face economic costs. Corporate accountability campaigners and health insurance exchange experts should put their heads together to determine the best ways to undermine abusive health insurance companies’ access to new customers and policy holders. In addition, investors in UnitedHealth Group and other abusive health insurers should face direct pressure to divest from these companies. Investment funds, retirement funds, university endowments, and other major investment players should all be pushed to take their money elsewhere. As documented by Derek Seidman in Truthout, the top two shareholders of UnitedHealthcare parent company UnitedHealth Group “are the world’s two biggest asset managers, BlackRock and Vanguard,” which oversee a combined total of over $20 trillion in assets. Not only that, but BlackRock and Vanguard are also the top two shareholders of each of the top four U.S. health insurers. Both investment firms should face public demands to stop building their wealth off of the suffering of the thousands of people denied coverage for their medical needs. Finally, the days of prominent politicians taking money from UnitedHealth Group must come to an end. It’s not hard to imagine a large number of senior citizens signing on to a demand that politicians should not take money from health insurance companies that are denying older Americans health care coverage. With elections for the next Democratic National Committee chair coming up in February 2025, now is the time to push the DNC to stop taking money from UnitedHealth Group and other major health insurers. Politicians who stay silent on these demands and who refuse to bluntly criticize health insurance executives and companies should face electoral boycotts in which voters commit to voting against them. In a fairer world, Brian Thompson wouldn’t have been murdered. He would already have been put behind bars. Health insurance executives profiting off of human suffering should live in fear. But what they should fear is jail, not murder. We don’t want to live in a society where private individuals become judges, juries, and street executioners based simply on their own determinations of morality or crime. That is the world in which anti-abortion activists kill doctors and nurses. It is the world where white supremacist gunmen assume Black community members are “criminals” to be executed. In the space between illegal vigilante violence and deference to a broken political system is a vast opportunity for constructive and sustained political disruption that eliminates the “safe space” for business executives who profit from the destruction of human life. One can easily condemn the murder of Thompson while simultaneously condemning who Thompson was and what UnitedHealthcare is known to have done. Denying countless people access to the medical coverage they needed has caused significant pain and suffering, and may have even caused many unnecessary and early deaths. That it took a murder of a health insurance CEO for us to be talking about this reveals just how broken our political, legal, and media systems are. Health insurance executives, investors, and the politicians who they purchase should all fear social ostracism, financial collapse, and political defeat. This is entirely possible if the political rage of the American public is combined with a strategic road map that turns that anger into action. The fundamental question is whether or not progressive leaders and health care reformers have the courage to turn this moment into something of lasting significance.

Title: Is it too late to buy bitcoin? Why some Wall Street experts say no — and 4 ways to start investing now.

If you go by some of the many cautionary investing adages — like "buy low, sell high" or Warren Buffett's "be fearful when others are greedy" — it may be tough to argue that bitcoin is a good buy right now. The days when bitcoin traded at mere fractions of a cent are long gone. The cryptocurrency's price is anything but low, at least relative to what it was, especially after a 55% rally to over $108,000 following Donald Trump's reelection. But some market experts are taking the opposite philosophy with bitcoin and believe it's a fine time to buy, thanks to favorable fundamental trends. "We believe it is the period leading up to large-scale adoption where the biggest future return potential could lie," Samara Cohen, the chief investment officer of ETFs and index investments at BlackRock, wrote about bitcoin in a recent note. Robert Cannon, a financial advisor at Experity Wealth, shares this view. "We're basically in the beginning, even though $100,000 seems like a high number," he told BI. He recommends investors allocate about 1% to 10% of their portfolios to crypto, depending on risk tolerance. Cannon has seen inklings that other governments, such as Argentina, could adopt bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset, sending the cryptocurrency's price even higher. "You want to get there before the big money is there," Cannon said. In other words, don't sit out on the bitcoin rally just because you think the ship has already sailed. Bill Miller IV, the chief investment officer and portfolio manager at Miller Value Funds, likens bitcoin to "digital gold" due to its scarce and decentralized nature. But the recent overwhelming interest in bitcoin is hardly a guarantee of its success. It's famously volatile and prone to dramatic price drops — hence why bitcoin bulls like BlackRock recommend exercising discretion and educating yourself on the risks when investing. But as institutional investors continue to pile in and talks about establishing a national bitcoin reserve swirl in Washington, it's increasingly apparent that the asset is being legitimized in the investing landscape. Luckily for investors, there's never been a more convenient time to be bitcoin-curious. As the cryptocurrency has gained steam in the past few years, mainstream brokerage firms have picked it up. You can purchase bitcoin directly through some online brokerages such as Fidelity, Robinhood, and Interactive Brokers. For those without $100,000 to drop on a bitcoin, these exchanges offer the opportunity to purchase fractional shares. However, others, like Charles Schwab and E-Trade, don't provide that option. If you want to hold bitcoin directly but can't buy it through your traditional brokerage account, fear not. There are several centralized crypto exchanges that provide a platform for buying and selling bitcoin, such as Coinbase, Kraken, and Gemini. Some bitcoin purists prefer buying on a decentralized exchange, similar to how some gold investors prefer buying bullion. "If you own bitcoin on a centralized entity, you force someone else to buy it on your behalf, but you don't actually hold the bitcoin," Miller said. Decentralized exchanges facilitate peer-to-peer trading without a broker, adding an extra layer of privacy and security. However, a decentralized exchange isn't the most beginner-friendly way to invest, as they have complex fee structures and don't permit exchanges between fiat and crypto. The first spot-bitcoin ETF debuted in the US in January 2024. A spot ETF provides investors with an accessible way of gaining exposure to bitcoin on a fully regulated traditional exchange. The funds hold bitcoins in a secure digital vault managed by registered custodians and issue shares to correspond with the number of bitcoins held. Bitcoin futures ETFs, which hold bitcoin futures contracts instead of actual bitcoins, are another investment vehicle. However, because they hold financial derivatives, these ETFs might not follow the price of bitcoin as closely as a spot ETF and can experience increased volatility due to the risks associated with futures contracts. Bitcoin ETFs are Cannon's go-to recommendation for new investors in the crypto space, as investors don't have to worry about directly holding bitcoin in a cryptocurrency wallet: "It's just like if they bought a stock," he said. He likes BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) in particular. Other examples of bitcoin ETFs include the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC), and the ProShares Bitcoin ETF (BITO). Similar to how central banks stockpile gold, some of the market's biggest companies are building up their bitcoin reserves, even if their business operations have nothing to do with bitcoin. John Haar, the managing director of the bitcoin financial services firm Swan Bitcoin, has seen investors increasing their bitcoin allocation indirectly by buying these companies' stocks. The business intelligence company Microstrategy (MSTR) is the most notable example in the market right now. Other companies adding bitcoin to their balance sheets include the biotech company Semler Scientific (SMLR) and the Japanese investment firm Metaplanet (MTPLF), Haar said. Investors can also get bitcoin exposure by going straight to the source and buying stock in bitcoin-mining companies, Haar added. As a decentralized asset, bitcoin depends on a network of users to keep a record of transactions and verify new ones. Bitcoin miners use crypto software and hardware to solve complex puzzles and confirm the addition of blocks to the public ledger. Haar pointed to two examples: Riot Platforms (RIOT) and Mara Holdings (MARA). These companies operate data centers to mine bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies and provide auxiliary cryptocurrency services.

Title: Homelessness in NZ: The Christmas reality is there’s no room at the inn for Kiwis needing help

Rotorua homeless couple Elaine Sawyer and Anaru Hauiti have been sleeping rough this year. Photo / Andrew Warner THREE KEY FACTS Central to the Christmas message is that everyone needs a home – an article of the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Yet as Christmas approaches this year, the coalition Government has announced that to meet their target for reducing Emergency Housing Special Needs Grants, the number of people in emergency housing will be reduced. Also, the availability of transitional housing will possibly be cut. It’s hard for anyone to know the number of people and families affected for sure, because they aren’t collected or reported. Moreover, the Ministry of Social Development (MSD), which manages the public housing waiting list and the Emergency Housing Special Need Grants, are placing barriers in the way of those who are urgently seeking housing. There are credible reports that to verify applicants seeking housing because they are victims of domestic violence, staff at MSD Community are encouraged to phone the abusive partner to confirm that their partner did not contribute to the violence. Community advocates report that the criteria for state housing help are becoming less and less transparent and people are increasingly having to reapply. Community providers are increasingly having to turn away applicants, who are desperate for sustainable housing, but not counted in formal statistics as in need of housing. Meanwhile the Government does not have an alternative housing policy and keeps no record of housing need. There is no plan for providing alternative state or community housing elsewhere, at the scale required. Despite its record of significantly upscaling the building of high-quality housing in sustainable communities, Kāinga Ora - Homes and Communities has been denied any further capital funding. It has been directed not to do any further developments, and to restrict its scope to being a landlord only. To the dismay of community housing providers, Housing Minister Chris Bishop made it clear at the recent Community Housing Aotearoa Conference that the Government is not going to underwrite most community housing providers to build more community housing. Their capital in most cases will need to come from private equity, perhaps overseas investors like BlackRock, which has summarily liquidated SolarZero, despite receiving a large capital injection from Government. Frontline community staff are now increasingly having to help people – both adults and children – who are homeless and living in cars, or on the streets. Homeless numbers have increased, as the recently released Severe Housing Deprivation Study, based on the 2023 Census, showed. By contrast, in a recent evaluation of The Housing First policy, it was shown to be the most effective way to help people back into stable housing. It enables them to re-enter employment, and for their children to be registered with a GP and immunised, prosper at school, keep well, and turn up less frequently at accident and emergency departments. Most dispiritingly, we have seen this cycle before: we know what the outcomes will be. When Sir Bill English was the Minister for Housing New Zealand Corporation, the precursor of Kāinga Ora from 2014-2016, he called himself “the largest slum landlord in New Zealand”. Between 2013/14 and 2016/17 the Minister began the sale of state housing, which led to about a 5000 fall in the number of state houses, without any serious consideration of the consequences. Unsurprisingly, this led to a major increase in homelessness. He established Emergency Housing, which mainly used temporary accommodation to house the growing numbers of people left homeless as a direct result of the lack of new public houses. For all too many people — children, adults, single people and families — this Christmas there is still “no room at the inn”. 'It’s a great initiative', young Hawke's Bay entrepreneur backed by Rod Drury.

Title: BlackRock Trust appoints new non-executive director

Title: Blackstone embraces country music and reality TV in its most ambitious holiday video yet. Watch it here.

Blackstone on Thursday launched its most ambitious holiday video yet on Thursday, featuring 200 employees, two cameos, and a country music song-and-line-dance routine. The video series, which has become must-see TV for Wall Street, is in its seventh year. Last year's version attracted widespread attention, resulting in 8 million views across various platforms, the company said. The videos seek to poke fun at the people behind Blackstone, which manages $1 trillion in assets, while also touting its investment prowess. This year's video ditched its usual framing around NBC's hit sitcom "The Office" in favor of reality-TV parodies and included a brief appearance by the "Real Housewives of New York" star and fashion designer Jenna Lyons. Some of Blackstone's portfolio companies, including Supergoop and Jersey Mike's, also got airtime. It kicks off with a recap of last year's video, which depicted Jon Gray, Blackstone's president and chief operating officer, compelling the firm's executives to go on tour like Taylor Swift. In a "Behind the Music"-type parody, the executives lament the poor reception they received for their "cringeworthy" song titled "The Alternatives Era." "People just stopped talking to me," Jon Korngold, the global cohead of technology investing and head of Blackstone growth, said. "CEOs, LPs, even my mom." BlackRock CEO Larry Fink makes an appearance to turn his nose up at the company. "Can you believe people confuse us with them," Fink says. The story takes a turn when Christine Anderson, the head of corporate affairs at Blackstone and one of the masterminds of the firm's holiday video tradition, decides that the next logical step is reality TV. The video, a metatextual reference to its own popularity, then hits overdrive with a series of reality television spoofs, from the "Real Housewives" to "The Bachelor." "I'm private equity's biggest asset," Joe Baratta, the head of private equity, says in a braggadocious manner while being introduced in the faux series, "The Real Executives of Park Avenue." Even the firm's international offices get in on the act with the London office starring in "Love Island Blackstone" and the Tokyo team competing in the infamous "Human Tetris" game-show stunt. Back at 345 Park Avenue, Gray's executive assistant, Laurie Carlson, throws a martini into the face of Joe Lohrer, the head of US retail sales for Blackstone's private wealth group. "Sorry, Joe, they wanted me to do something dramatic," Carlson says. The head of Blackstone's video team, Jay Gillespie, makes an appearance as a reality-television producer and calls for another martini to try the shot again. Perhaps the funniest bit is Schwarzman's appearance in a parody of "Keeping Up with the Kardashians," in which he is filmed awkwardly cutting a cucumber à la Kendall Jenner. Back in the conference room, Gray tells the firm that they're going down the wrong path. A running gag in the series is that no one wants to go along with Gray's hare-brained ideas and it seems like he's finally come to his senses. Instead, he proposes another zany idea. "Blackstone needs to go country," Gray says. The video is capped off by the firm's second original song as executives sing and dance around the office, in Midtown traffic, and on the back of a mechanical bull. The song's chorus, lip-synced by Schwarzman in the video, is "You can build. You can build with Blackstone," a reference to the firm's first television ad, which was released earlier this year.

The bitcoin price has doubled since its August lows, riding a wave of interest that's been fueled by Donald Trump's U.S. election victory and U.S. dollar collapse warnings from Tesla billionaire Elon Musk. Now, as Trump confirms he has big plans for bitcoin, BlackRock has shocked some in the bitcoin community with a bitcoin explainer video that warns there's "no guarantee" bitcoin's 21 million supply cap won't be changed in the future. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink has helped the bitcoin price surge this year. In the BlackRock video, given a boost when it was shared by MicroStrategy's Michael Saylor, bitcoin was described as having a fixed supply of 21 million—"this hard-coded rule controls supply, purchasing power and helps avoid the potential misuse of printing more and more currency." However, a disclaimer appeared alongside the description, adding: "There is no guarantee that bitcoin's 21 million supply cap will not be changed"—something that undermines bitcoin's growing reputation as a scarce digital asset comparable to gold. BlackRock's admission that bitcoin's supply cap could be changed has been taken by some as confirmation BlackRock's adoption of bitcoin will lead to it being "hijacked." "They're getting everyone used to this eventuality," Joel Valenzuela, business development lead for the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) of the cryptocurrency dash, posted to X. "When the supply cap increase happens, it will have 'always been part of the plan.' And today, in 2024, people have the audacity to say bitcoin wasn't hijacked." Bitcoin's supply is fixed at around 21 million, though the last bitcoin aren't expected to be created—via a process known as mining—until around the year 2140, over a century from now. The number of bitcoin that can be issued is part of bitcoin's code and it would require agreement among those that secure the bitcoin network in return for newly minted bitcoin, known as miners, to change that. If a majority of miners did vote to increase the supply of bitcoin, the network would split, or fork, and the minority would continue to direct their computing power toward the network that is capped at around 21 million bitcoin.

Title: Stocks tanked after the Fed signaled fewer rate cuts next year. Here's what analysts are saying.

Full Content:
The Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday to a range of 4.25% to 4.5%, bringing its decline since mid-September to 100 basis points. Wall Street usually celebrates rate cuts as lowering borrowing costs drives spending, investing, and hiring. Reducing rates also signals inflation is under control and makes risk assets like stocks relatively more attractive by trimming yields on safer assets like Treasurys. Yet stocks tanked because Fed officials projected two cuts next year, down from four previously. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones declined nearly 3%, while the Nasdaq 100 dipped nearly 4% after the meeting. The sharp drop fueled a 74% surge in VIX, better known as the stock market's fear gauge. It was its second-largest one-day jump in history. But while many market pros still urge caution amid fewer rate cuts in 2025, a number of analysts across Wall Street see Wednesday's sell-off as a "buy the dip" opportunity, with the intense reaction to the Fed meeting unlikely to derail this year's "Santa Claus" rally. Here's what investors and analysts are saying after Wednesday's brutal sell-off. Investors were "overreacting" because they knew going into the meeting that the Fed was likely to signal a pause in rate cuts, Schleif said. On top of that, the economy remains strong, which is what matters the most, she added. "Markets seemed to ignore the number of times and ways that Chair Powell noted how strong the economy is," Schleif said. "The slower pace of Fed cuts is for a good reason, which is that the economy is strong, and a strong economy is ultimately what matters most for stocks and earnings." Economists at Citi said the Fed's hawkish pivot probably wouldn't last and instead turn dovish once the labor market showed signs of weakening. With just 50 basis points of interest-rate cuts priced into the market between now and mid-2026, Hollenhorst isn't buying it. "The continued softening of the labor market is likely to become even more evident in coming months, keeping the Fed cutting at a faster pace than markets are pricing," Hollenhorst said in a note on Wednesday. "We expect a sharp dovish pivot from Powell and the committee in the next few months." Ives said the Fed's interest-rate path is not what will be the driving force for tech stocks over the next few years. "Ultimately it does not move the needle for a soft landing and bullish backdrop for risk-on assets," Ives said in a note to clients. Instead, Ives told his clients to stay laser-focused on the two biggest catalysts for tech heading into 2025: the continued development and adoption of AI and a friendlier regulatory environment that should pave the way for more mergers and acquisitions. "US markets played the part of Scrooge on Wednesday, tumbling as the Federal Reserve's hawkish tone dampened holiday cheer. "Investors should see this as a healthy spot of profit-taking rather than an end to the party, after what's been a fantastic run for markets since the US election." "This is a Fed that really has no faith in its view at any time and is willingly reactive as opposed to proactive even though its actions affect the economy with long lags. "You would have thought that between the commentary and forecast changes that the world has changed dramatically since the jumbo rate cut just three months ago. It clearly does not take much to cause this Fed to swing its view around. I can guarantee that it will shift again." "'We had a year-end inflation forecast, and it's kind of fallen apart.' "Not exactly the confidence-inspiring line you'd expect from a Fed chair. But Jerome Powell's performance at yesterday's press conference wasn't his finest hour. In what might have been the most uncomfortable showing of his tenure, Powell ceded the stage to the hawks, visibly strained as he tried to sell a strategy he didn't fully appear to endorse. "Powell flagged inflation 'moving sideways' and 'higher uncertainty' around its trajectory. These admissions reveal a central bank increasingly unsure of its footing, with rates markets now expecting just one cut for 2025 (as we do), and with no real consensus on when that final cut would arrive." "Markets have a really bad of habit of overreacting to Fed policy moves. The Fed didn't do or say anything that deviated from what the market expected — this seems more like, I'm leaving for Christmas break, so I'll sell and start up next year. "The good news is that this 10-day sell-off should lay the path for a Santa Rally leading into next week." "Santa came early and dropped a 25-bps rate cut in the market's stocking but accompanied it with a note saying that there would be coal next year. "The market is forward-looking and ignored the good news of today's rate cut and instead focused on the paucity of rate cuts for next year." "What was heard last night from the Fed as an accompaniment to the interest rate cut is a showstopper for the stock market. "The Fed is sending a clear signal that it has almost completed the phase of interest rate cuts. The year 2025 will be a significant break in the Fed's rate-cutting cycle. "The Trump blessing could quickly turn into a curse. If the market expects yields to rise further, it is unlikely that the Fed will intervene against these forces. If inflation data continues to rise in January and February, then that could be it for the interest rate cuts." "While the Fed is taking all the heat for today's sell-off, a reality check from overbought conditions, deteriorating market breadth, and rising rates was arguably overdue. "Overall, today's FOMC meeting brought back some unwanted clouds of uncertainty over monetary policy next year. At a minimum, market expectations have shifted toward a shallower- and slower-than-anticipated rate-cutting cycle. Technically, the near-term risk remains to the upside for 10-year Treasury yields, creating a likely headwind for stocks." "The Fed has poured cold water on already dwindling market hopes for generous rate cuts in 2025. "Given the risk of resurging inflation from potential trade tariffs and a slowdown in immigration that has been cooling pressure in the labor market, market expectations of only two more cuts in 2025 now seem reasonable. "We expected this policy outcome, so it doesn't change our recently upgraded view on US equities. US stocks can still benefit from AI and other mega forces, from robust economic growth and from broad earnings growth — and we see them outperforming international peers in 2025." "With an economy that's going gangbusters and an incoming president with a fiscally loose agenda, you wonder why the Fed felt it necessary to cut. "Is this to curry favor with the incoming administration or is there a bump in the road the Fed can see that the rest of us are missing." "The FOMC delivered about as hawkish a cut as they could muster up yesterday, and market participants were not particularly pleased about what they heard. "It was, though, a little perplexing to see such a violent market reaction to Powell's remarks, particularly considering how 'every man and his dog' had been expecting this sort of a pivot in the run up to the meeting. "It feels, though, as if markets have overreacted to Powell's message, and that we may have reached something of a hawkish extreme here. "Consequently, I'd be a dip buyer of equities here, as strong earnings and economic growth should see the path of least resistance continuing to lead to the upside, offsetting the fading impact of the 'Fed Put.'"

In 2009, Forbes ranked the Wealthiest Black Americans and the only billionaire on the list was Oprah Winfrey, then worth an estimated $2.7 billion. Among the 20 entrepreneurs, moguls, athletes and entertainers on that inaugural ranking was Robert Johnson, the cofounder of Black Entertainment Television (BET), then worth $550 million, Michael Jordan (then worth an estimated $525 million), Magic Johnson ($500 million) and Shaquille O’Neal ($130 million). Motown Records founder and music business icon Berry Gordy, 95, made the list with a fortune then estimated at $325 million as well as Bill Cosby (with a net worth of $450 million) and Ken Chenault, the first (and only) Black CEO of American Express, who was worth $125 million. The Wealthiest Black Americans list was powerful. It was intended to keep track of success in Black America and over the years, Forbes has remained committed to celebrating the achievements of Black entrepreneurs. In 2023, when Forbes launched the ForbesBLK platform, creating a new list of the wealthiest Black Americans was one of its main objectives—but net worth isn’t the only way to keep score of impact and influence in the community and world at large. The inaugural ForbesBLK 50 list accomplishes this mission, combining some of the richest Black Americans with pioneering entrepreneurs, activists and innovators. Many of the names from 2009 still appear on the 2024 list—including Oprah, MJ and Magic. The BLK 50 also celebrates new wealth creators such as Fawn Weaver, the founder and CEO of Uncle Nearest, an estimated $1.1 billion whiskey brand and the largest Black-owned spirits company in the country. It also honors individuals in the financial sector and clean energy, as well as top executives ranging from the CEO of a nuclear energy company to celebrities winning in business. As part of the list, ForbesBLK also curated a three-part video series about how to build wealth in three sectors: Real Estate, featuring Don Peebles, founder and CEO of the Peebles Corporation; Sustainability, with Josh Aviv, founder and CEO of mobile EV charging startup SparkCharge; and investing, with wisdom from Tracy Maitland, founder and president of Advent Capital Management. Introducing the inaugural class of the ForbesBLK 50: taylor hill/getty images Abbey is cofounder and co-CEO of Esusu, a New York fintech startup that helps renters build their credit histories and scores by reporting rent payments to credit bureaus. More than 20,000 properties currently offer Esusu’s service and some 1.8 million Americans have used Esusu to record a rent payment. The startup also recently launched a direct-to-consumer product, MyEsusu, through which consumers can build credit and monitor their credit scores. In early 2022, Esusu raised $130 million in funding at a $1 billion valuation. Before founding Esusu, Abbey, who grew up in Lagos, Nigeria, worked as a mergers and acquisitions consultant at PWC and cofounded a non-profit and a data analytics startup. Forbes Born in Saudi Arabia to Sudanese parents, Abuzeid studied to be a doctor at University College London before moving to the United States to become a healthcare consultant. In 2017, Abuzeid cofounded the healthcare hiring platform Incredible Health, which private investors valued at $1.65 billion in 2022. That propelled Abuzeid onto a small list of Black female founders of companies worth more than $1 billion. With an estimated net worth of $350 million based on her stake in Incredible Health, she also ranks among the top 100 Self-Made Women in America on Forbes’ 2024 list. al drago/bloomberg From his dorm room at Syracuse University, Aviv founded SparkCharge, a mobile electric vehicle charger designed to eliminate “range anxiety” —or the fear EV drivers have about getting stranded because the country isn't fully prepared to charge electric cars. SparkCharge raised $59 million from investors since 2017, according to PitchBook. Additionally, in 2020, it received a $1 million investment from billionaire Mark Cuban after appearing on Shark Tank. jamel toppin for forbes Awotona is the founder and CEO of the scheduling software startup Calendly, which private investors valued at $3 billion in 2021. Born in Lagos, Nigeria, Awotona moved to Atlanta when he was 15, and studied computer science at the University of Georgia before switching majors to business and management information. After working as a salesman for several tech firms and launching a few failed startups, Awotona cashed in his 401(k) in 2013 to found Calendly because he was frustrated with the number of emails it required to schedule meetings. After bootstrapping the company for several years, in 2021 Awotona raised $350 million to further scale Calendly. Today, he is worth an estimated $1.4 billion. Forbes Bradley is the founder and managing partner of 1863 Ventures, a Washington D.C.-based nonprofit business accelerator and venture capital fund focusing on women and people of color. In 2022, Bradley’s impact landed her on the Forbes 50 Over 50 list. A graduate of Georgetown, she worked as a regulator for Black banks in the Obama Administration. In 2016, she led a summit to discover 500 Black entrepreneurs in the Washington, D.C. area, which led to the formation of 1863 Ventures. By funding a new generation of entrepreneurs, and scaling their businesses, Bradley has a goal of unlocking $100 billion in wealth creation in the Black community by 2030. jamel toppin for forbes Drafted in 1975 by the Los Angeles Lakers, then traded to the Milwaukee Bucks for Basketball Hall of Famer Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Bridgeman was one of the most successful NBA sixth men. Throughout his 12-year career, his top salary was $350,000, but after retiring in 1987 he made smart investments, acquiring more than 450 fast-food franchises, including Wendy’s, Chili’s, and Pizza Hut, before acquiring a Coca-Cola bottling company in 2016 and selling nearly half of his restaurant holdings. In September, Bridgeman’s story came full circle when he acquired a 10% stake in the Bucks, a team that Forbes estimates is worth $3.7 billion (net of debt). Forbes Brown is the founder and chairman of Brown Capital Management, one of the nation’s oldest Black-owned investment firms with $8.8 billion in assets under management. Known as Baltimore-based T.

Rowe Price as a growth-stock fund manager. A decade later, he started his own firm while also becoming a regular on the PBS show Wall Street Week. Brown and his wife, Sylvia, estimate that they have donated more than $55 million to philanthropic causes throughout Baltimore. Forbes Bryant is the CEO of Atlanta-based nonprofit Operation HOPE, which helps make capitalism work for underserved communities. Raised in Los Angeles by a single mother, Bryant founded Operation HOPE in 1992 with financial literacy as its core mission. Since its inception, Operation HOPE estimates it has stimulated and directed more than $4 billion of economic activity into disadvantaged communities. In 2020, Bryant also secured a $130 million commitment from e-commerce company Shopify to help launch one million Black Businesses by 2030. To date, Operation HOPE estimates that more than 350,000 businesses have been launched through the program. jamel toppin for forbes In 2022, Butler was named the first Black president and CEO of Exelon, the nation’s largest utility company, serving more than 10 million customers in Chicago, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington, D.C. and beyond.

After a career in television, she taught herself the restaurant business using the internet and, in 2014, opened her first restaurant—a Jamaican eatery in Harlem that caught fire after two years and eventually closed. However, two years later, Cole remerged and started Slutty Vegan from her apartment in Atlanta. Slutty Vegan now has 12 franchises throughout the country.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Dogs of the Dow Dividend Stocks to Invest in. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) stands against the other dividend stocks. Dividend-focused investors are often drawn to stocks with high yields, shaping their strategies around acquiring such investments. A notable approach is the Dogs of the Dow (DOD) strategy, which involves selecting the 10 highest dividend-yielding stocks from the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) each year. This method operates on the belief that these so-called "Dogs" are either undervalued or out of favor. By targeting these stocks, investors hope to benefit from potential price appreciation while also securing a steady stream of dividend income. The strategy is based on the idea that these high-yield stocks are merely temporarily undervalued and are likely to recover shortly. Numerous financial experts have provided detailed explanations of the strategy to help investors develop a thorough understanding of it. Robert R. Johnson, professor of finance at the Heider College of Business at Creighton University, spoke about the Dogs in one of his interviews with Business Insider. Here are some comments from the analyst: “The underlying premise behind the strategy is mean reversion. The [Dogs of the Dow] is based on the theory that stocks can be over or undervalued, but over the long run those that are undervalued will 'revert to the mean.” Dow stocks are typically not inexpensive without reason. These companies rarely face the risk of going out of business, and their high yields often result from falling out of favor. According to a report by Forbes, historically, the Dogs have delivered strong long-term performance, but their recent results have been mixed. While they lagged behind the broader market in 2019, 2020, and 2021, they surged ahead in 2022, only to underperform again in 2023. Also read: 10 Best Mid-Cap Dividend Aristocrats To Buy However, over the long term, the strategy has managed to outperform its benchmark. Michael O'Higgins found that over a 26-year period, a theoretical portfolio made up of high dividend-yield stocks from the Dow Jones delivered an annualized return of 17.9%. This performance exceeded the Dow Jones Industrial Average's annualized return of 13% during the same timeframe. A study in the International Journal of Trade, Economics, and Finance analyzed various versions of the DOD strategy and found that they consistently outperformed the DJIA on a risk-adjusted basis. The research explored three DOD variations: Dow-10, Dow-5, and the "Small Dogs of the Dow," while incorporating recent market events like the 2001 dot-com bubble, the 2008 financial crisis, and the subsequent recovery. The study revealed that all three strategies delivered better investment performance than the DJIA between 1996 and 2006. Notably, the traditional Dow-10 portfolio achieved a total return of 406.6% during this time, surpassing the DJIA’s return of 355.6%. Despite the strong performance of the Dogs, analysts caution investors to approach this strategy with care. Kevin Simpson, founder and chief investment officer at Capital Wealth Planning, made the following comment in one of his interviews with CNBC: “The idea here is that just because they’re ‘Dogs of the Dow’ — some of them really are dogs — and you have to be careful and selective as a stock picker.” Our Methodology: We began with a pool of 30 stocks from the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and identified dividend-paying stocks from this selection. As a majority of the stocks in the index offer dividends, we specifically picked the 10 stocks with the highest dividend yields as of December 17. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of their dividend yields. We also considered hedge fund sentiment around each stock using Insider Monkey’s data for Q3 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). Engineers using the latest Cisco TelePresence technology to collaborate with colleagues around the world. Dividend Yield as of December 17: 2.72% Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) is a California-based digital communications tech company. In its recent quarterly earnings, the company noted that its customers are focusing on investments in critical infrastructure to support AI development, highlighting the unique advantage its broad portfolio provides in seizing this opportunity. Its revenue, gross margin, and earnings per share exceeded expectations, falling at the high end or above the guidance range and delivering strong operating leverage. The stock has surged by nearly 16% since the start of 2024. In fiscal Q1 2025, Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) reported revenue of $13.8 billion, which fell by 6% from the same period last year. However, the revenue surpassed analysts' estimates by $70.5 million. The company's net income for the quarter came in at $2.7 billion. Alongside delivering strong earnings, the company completed the acquisitions of DeepFactor, Inc., a private firm specializing in cloud-native application security, and Robust Intelligence, Inc., a private company offering AI security solutions. Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO)'s cash position makes it a solid dividend payer. In the most recent quarter, the company generated $3.7 billion in operating cash flow, up 54% from the same period last year. It ended the quarter with $18.7 billion available in cash and cash equivalents. The company also returned $1.6 billion to shareholders through dividends. Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO), one of the best Dogs of the Dow, has been growing its dividends for 17 consecutive years. The company currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.40 per share and has a dividend yield of 2.72%, as of December 17. As of the close of Q3 2024, 60 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported having stakes in Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO), compared with 61 in the previous quarter. The consolidated value of these stakes is over $3 billion. With over 11.7 million shares, Arrowstreet Capital was the company's leading stakeholder in Q3. Overall CSCO ranks 8th on our list of the best dogs of the Dow dividend stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of CSCO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

The research explored three DOD variations: Dow-10, Dow-5, and the "Small Dogs of the Dow," while incorporating recent market events like the 2001 dot-com bubble, the 2008 financial crisis, and the subsequent recovery. The study revealed that all three strategies delivered better investment performance than the DJIA between 1996 and 2006. Notably, the traditional Dow-10 portfolio achieved a total return of 406.6% during this time, surpassing the DJIA’s return of 355.6%. Despite the strong performance of the Dogs, analysts caution investors to approach this strategy with care. Kevin Simpson, founder and chief investment officer at Capital Wealth Planning, made the following comment in one of his interviews with CNBC: “The idea here is that just because they’re ‘Dogs of the Dow’ — some of them really are dogs — and you have to be careful and selective as a stock picker.” Our Methodology: We began with a pool of 30 stocks from the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and identified dividend-paying stocks from this selection. As a majority of the stocks in the index offer dividends, we specifically picked the 10 stocks with the highest dividend yields as of December 17. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of their dividend yields. We also considered hedge fund sentiment around each stock using Insider Monkey’s data for Q3 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

Dividend Yield as of December 17: 2.17% 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) is an American multinational conglomerate that operates in a wide variety of industries. Earlier this year, the company encountered significant challenges, including spinning off its healthcare business and reducing its dividend by 50%. In addition, it has been under pressure for years due to ongoing legal and regulatory issues. Despite these hurdles, the company is actively addressing these challenges and has developed a plan to manage the related expenses. Importantly, management now seems more optimistic about the future compared to their outlook at the beginning of the year. The stock is up by over 40% since the start of 2024. 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) reported strong earnings in the third quarter of 2024. The company's revenue of $6.07 billion showed a modest growth of 1% on a YoY basis. The revenue beat analysts' estimates by $10.66 million. It reported a strong operational performance, achieving a double-digit rise in adjusted earnings and robust adjusted free cash flow generation. In addition, 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) also demonstrated a solid cash position in the quarter. The company's free cash flow amounted to $1.5 billion, which allowed it $1.1 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Currently, the company offers a quarterly dividend of $0.70 per share and has a dividend yield of 2.17%, as of December 17. Before slashing its dividend earlier this year, the company maintained a 66-year streak of dividend growth. 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) was a popular buy among elite money managers during the third quarter of 2024.

Ken Griffin's Citadel Investment Group was the company's leading stakeholder in Q3. Overall MMM ranks 9th on our list of the best dogs of the Dow dividend stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of MMM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Many are keeping pace with, and even surpassing in performance, than those in the US. As such, artificial intelligence has become the “latest battleground” for China and the US. The US has been tightening its restrictions on China’s access to advanced chips used in AI because of national concerns. As a result, China has been focusing on carving its own path for boosting the appeal and performance of its AI models. This includes relying on open-source technology and developing their own super-fast software and chips. Chinese companies are developing open-source, or open-weight, LLMs. Developers can download them and build on top of them for free without having to obtain stringent licensing requirements from the inventor. “In the last year, we’ve seen the rise of open source Chinese contributions to AI with really strong performance, low cost to serve and high throughput”. In the latest innovations in artificial intelligence technology, China’s leading search engine company Baidu has launched a text-to-image generation tool for its ad clients. The company also plans to release AI glasses early next year as well as inaugurate its robotaxi service outside mainland China. Timothy Wang, chief investment officer at Monolith, predicts China’s homegrown AI-powered products and services are poised to grow in the coming year. Hedge fund manager Sean Ho, CIO of Triata Capital which manages $770 million in assets, said about Chinese advancements in AI: “We are seeing breakthroughs in AI software, such as text-to-video generation and multimodal AI…The high rankings of Chinese AI models on open-source platforms like Hugging Face reflect their ambition to lead globally, a trend that is unlikely to be derailed by ongoing tech conflicts”.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Important Stocks that Jim Cramer is Talking About. In this article, we are going to take a look at where RH (NYSE:RH) stands against the other important stocks that Jim Cramer is talking about. Jim Cramer in a latest program talked about the latest market volatility and said using too many AI algorithms, data points and correlations could be useful for short-term traders but for investors, these tools could blur your long-term vision. “I think as investors we're putting on mental shackles if we behave like this. Remember back in my hedge fund, our whole goal was day trading, was to scalp pennies from the flow. That's a lot of risk for not much reward. It's better to zero in on dollars for the big picture. That's what I want you to do.” Jim Cramer said that the market is currently oversold and this happened twice before in 2024. These moments, according to Cramer, proved to be some of the best entry points to pile into stocks in hindsight. READ ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In. For this article we watched Jim Cramer's recent programs and listed some of the stocks he commented on. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 39 Discussing home furnishing retailer RH (NYSE:RH) latest quarterly results, Jim Cramer praised the company’s CEO Gary Friedman: “I would tell you that in a market where the worst housing markets in three decades have been pulled off, there’s finally a lot of his European expansion that’s good. In America, it’s been turning well ahead of where I thought it was going to be even last quarter. My hat is off to him. There’s a gigantic short position now, some of it’s set to convert, but Gary bought so much stock, and people just felt he was rolling the dice. But Gary knew his business, and I think he’s a delight. I think he’s a competitor like none other, and congratulations.” RH (NYSE:RH) revenue in the recently reported quarter rose year over year while the company saw a 120.9% surge in adjusted operating income. During the earnings call, management disclosed that RH gained market share by 15-25 basis points in Q3 and expects to achieve another 25-45 basis points in gains during Q4. The housing market remains weak, so how was the company able to pull this off? The company is expanding to new products to support its outlet business and successfully launching new categories for baby, child, and teen products. RH anticipates that their contract, outlet, baby & child, and teen businesses will continue to drive business growth in FY25. Polen U.S. Small Company Growth Strategy stated the following regarding RH (NYSE:RH) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “We exited four positions during the quarter, including SiTime, AppFolio, RH (NYSE:RH), Doximity, and Alight. We sold our position in furniture retailer RH due to our concerns over the company’s higher-than-average leverage in an uncertain economic environment. We also see the long-term growth outlook as less clear as the U.S. market matures and international expansion is nascent. We do not believe the valuation reflected this risk and envisioned opportunities for better returns elsewhere.” Overall, RH ranks 10th on our list of the important stocks that Jim Cramer is talking about. While we acknowledge the potential of RH, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than RH but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: New judge to preside over 1MDB's US$346mil suit against Rosmah
URL: https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2024/12/19/new-judge-to-preside-over-1mdb039s-us346mil-suit-against-rosmah
Time Published: 2024-12-19T09:44:00Z
Full Content:
Thursday, 19 Dec 2024 KUALA LUMPUR: The US$346mil lawsuit filed by 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) and 10 other companies against Datin Seri Rosmah Mansor, alleging the use of misappropriated 1MDB funds to purchase luxury goods, is now under the jurisdiction of High Court Judge Wan Muhammad Amin Wan Yahya. The development was confirmed by lawyer Villasha Anbalagan, who represents all the plaintiffs, comprising 1MDB and the 10 companies. "Today was the first case management before the new judge, Justice Wan Muhammad Amin Wan Yahya. The court has fixed Feb 7 next year for the parties to update the status of the suit,” she said in a WhatsApp message following the proceedings conducted via Zoom. Last month, High Court Judge Justice Leong Wai Hong, a former partner at Messrs Skrine, recused himself from presiding over the lawsuit after granting Rosmah's application, citing his connection to the law firm. Rosmah’s recusal application raised concerns over a conflict of interest, as Skrine is representing 1MDB in a civil suit filed against her husband, former prime minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak, and several 1MDB officials. Before Justice Leong, the case was presided over by High Court Judge Justice Adlin Abdul Majid, who dismissed Rosmah’s initial recusal application on Sept 9, on the grounds stating that she failed to provide evidence of a real danger of bias. ALSO READ: New judge to hear Rosmah’s case However, Justice Adlin’s consequent transfer to the High Court’s Intellectual Property Division, led to Justice Leong taking over the case. The lawsuit, filed on May 9 this year, involves 1MDB and its five subsidiaries-1MDB Energy Holdings Limited, 1MDB Energy Limited, 1MDB Energy (Langat) Limited, Global Diversified Investment Company Limited, and SRC International Sdn Bhd. The five other companies are Affinity Equity International Partners Limited, Alsen Chance Holdings Limited, Blackrock Commodities (Global) Limited, Blackstone Asia Real Estate Partners Limited, and Brightstone Jewellery Limited. The plaintiffs have named Rosmah and a woman identified as Shabnam Naraindas Daswani, also known as Natasha Mirpuri, as the first and second defendants, respectively. They are seeking a court order demanding Rosmah pay US$346,010,489 or an amount deemed appropriate by the court. The plaintiffs are also seeking declarations that the first to sixth plaintiffs hold rightful ownership of the luxury items, which are purportedly in Rosmah’s possession.- Bernama Related stories: New judge to hear Rosmah’s caseRosmah still faces multiple court casesRosmah fails in bid to recuse judge from hearing 1MDB's RM346mil suit against herRespect court's decision to acquit Rosmah, says ZahidRosmah calls acquittal a 'meaningful birthday gift' Rosmah still faces multiple court casesRosmah fails in bid to recuse judge from hearing 1MDB's RM346mil suit against herRespect court's decision to acquit Rosmah, says ZahidRosmah calls acquittal a 'meaningful birthday gift' Rosmah fails in bid to recuse judge from hearing 1MDB's RM346mil suit against herRespect court's decision to acquit Rosmah, says ZahidRosmah calls acquittal a 'meaningful birthday gift' Respect court's decision to acquit Rosmah, says ZahidRosmah calls acquittal a 'meaningful birthday gift' Rosmah calls acquittal a 'meaningful birthday gift' Tags / Keywords: 1MDB , Wan Muhammad Amin Wan Yahya , Leong Wai Hong , recusal application , granted , Villasha Anbalagan Report it to us.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire David Einhorn. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Green Brick Partners, Inc. (NYSE:GRBK) stands against the other best stocks to buy according to Billionaire David Einhorn. The markets are broken and getting worse. That’s the stance held by billionaire investor David Einhorn, who insists we are in a secular destruction of the professional asset management community. The sentiments come against one of the longest bull runs that have resulted in valuations in the equity markets getting out of hand. While the S&P 500 is at record highs after a 30% plus gain year to date, Einhorn views the markets as fundamentally broken. Passive investors with no opinion or concern about value have been the main drivers pushing the market higher while shunning underlying fundamentals. According to Einhorn, passive investors increasingly buy into market indexes by default, propping growth stocks at the expense of value stocks. READ ALSO: Billionaire Daniel Sundheim’s Top 15 Stock Picks Heading Into 2025 and Billionaire David Tepper’s Top 10 Stock Picks Heading into 2025. Likewise, the billionaire hedge fund manager laments that value investors are increasingly marginalized. “And so effectively instead of the valuation becoming the signal, the valuation people were just noise and everybody else is sort of the signal. And this is why I think we have a structurally dysfunctional market, a bit of a broken market, and essentially a perpetual erosion of value as a strategy, as you would,” Einhorn said in an interview with CNBC. The sentiments underline the growing concerns that value stocks are becoming increasingly cheaper and cheaper relative to their underlying fundamentals. That’s in part because investors are turning their attention to indexes and growth stocks, resulting in overstretched valuations. Increased focus on growth stocks at the expense of value stocks has resulted in one of the most expensive stock markets in decades. Amid the premium valuations, David Einhorn insists there is still some value to unlock by focusing on value stocks trading at discounted valuations. By focusing on value investments, Einhorn has generated strong long-term returns through Greenlight Capital, the hedge fund he founded in 1996 with $900,000 from family and friends. Likewise, Greenlight Capital rose to prominence at the height of the financial crisis, as Einhorn sensed a window of opportunity to generate some returns by shorting the stock of Lehman brothers. Similarly, it was on the news in 2002 as it shorted Allied Capital, a transaction that was validated in 2002 by the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Since 1996, Greenlight Capital has averaged 13.1% in annual returns compared to 9.5% gains for the S&P 500. The outperformance comes from Einhorn emphasizing the balancing of long- and short-term exposure in investments. Likewise, he advocates monitoring industry risks and obtaining insurance against foreseeable macro threats. Additionally, stock picking has always been essential as one of Einhorn's key investment strategies of integrating considerable picture awareness into successful portfolio management strategies. Diversification as one of the ways of spreading risks is also Einhorn’s key investment strategies. “Having my eyes open to the big picture doesn’t mean abandoning stock picking, but it does mean managing the long-short exposure ratio more actively, worrying about what may be brewing in certain industries, and, when appropriate, buying some just-in-case insurance for foreseeable macro risks even if they are hard to time,” Einhorn said. To make the list of the best stocks to buy according to billionaire David Einhorn, we scanned Greenlight Capital’s investment portfolio. We then settled on the hedge fund’s largest holdings analyzing why they stand out and the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in them. Finally, we ranked the stocks in ascending order based on Greenlight Capital's stake value. At Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Greenlight Capital’s Stake Value: $790.72 Million Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 23 Green Brick Partners, Inc. (NYSE:GRBK) is a diversified homebuilding and land development company. It acquires land to develop residential lots transferred to controlled builders or sold to third-party homebuilders. It also provides a financial services platform, including mortgage and title services. As interest rates come down and consumer purchasing power improves, it is one of the best stocks to buy, according to billionaire David Einhorn. The stock is already up by more than 21% for the year, outperforming amid a challenging market environment hurt by high interest rates. Green Brick Partners, Inc. (NYSE:GRBK) delivered record-breaking Q3 2024 results on October 30, 2024. It logged a 25.7% increase in revenues at $523 million after delivering 956 homes at an average price of $546,900. Likewise, earnings per share were up 27% to $1.98. Green Brick Partners continues to deliver industry-leading building gross margins of 32.7%.

Green Brick Partners, Inc. (NYSE:GRBK) plans to invest $700 million in land acquisition and development and plans to introduce Green Brick Mortgage in Q1 2025. In keeping with its infill strategy, the business also intends to grow into northern Austin, Texas. The company's strategic growth plans affirm long-term prospects. Overall, GRBK ranks 1st on our list of best stocks to buy according to Billionaire David Einhorn. While we acknowledge the potential of GRBK to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Title: Can China Shield the Biggest Uninsured Economy From Floods?

The rivers and canals that meander through Hemudu in southeastern China are a vital source of life and community — they provide income for fishermen, an after-school hangout spot for kids, and define the town’s landscape. But when it rains, those waterways become a liability. “This area floods every year,” says Zheng, a long-time resident who lives less than a mile away from a river. Over the past decade and a half, Zheng has seen floodwater repeatedly threaten the ground-floor grocery store that he runs and his home above. But with his income “barely enough to make ends meet” and a grandson to look after, the 60-year-old says relocation isn’t an option. He’s tried but failed to insure his property. “Insurance companies turned us down because they said they’d have no chance to make money,” says Zheng, who asked not to be identified by his full name for fear of reprisal. “No one would take such a risk.” Zheng is one of hundreds of millions of Chinese citizens whose homes and livelihoods have grown more precarious on a rapidly warming planet. Of the 20 most climate-vulnerable regions, 16 are on Chinese soil. Yet the world’s second-largest economy is among the least insured. Only about 10% of Chinese families have a home insurance policy, according to industry estimates. That figure is nearly 90% in the US. China’s government knows it has to do something about that gap, which Swiss Re AG estimates amounted to $273 billion in uninsured losses over the last decade. Officials first started seriously discussing the need to build an insurance system after the devastating 2008 Sichuan earthquake killed almost 90,000 people and cost an estimated 845 billion yuan ($116 billion). But uptake has been slow, and now climate change is making insurance increasingly unattainable all over the world. Part of the problem is cultural. Many Chinese people have traditionally relied on the government and family members in times of trouble, rather than market-based financial products. “Insurance as a service has not been widely accepted in China,” says Tian Ling, a professor at Wuhan University’s Economics and Management School. “If it’s up to Chinese individuals, very few people would buy catastrophe insurance. That leaves the government no choice but to purchase it for their citizens.” As China’s government faces pressure from the public to show it’s taking steps to protect people from more extreme weather, the nation’s top-down economic management style is colliding with an insurance industry upended by global warming. Officials have started buying policies that cover entire cities and provinces. But local authorities are short on cash, meaning the coverage they can afford is far from what’s needed, even as rising climate risks cause premiums to surge. The decade-long initiative instead risks downplaying how exposed people really are and could even backfire by making it harder to unlock national funds in times of crisis, since these regions are ostensibly covered by the private market. In 2014, the government of Ningbo, which oversees Hemudu, stepped in to buy citywide catastrophe insurance to cover residents like Zheng. A typhoon had wreaked havoc on the city the year before, prompting thousands of people to protest what they saw as insufficient disaster relief. It was one of the first experiments in what would eventually become a nationwide trial covering tens of millions of people in 74 cities and 15 provinces. Unlike Zheng’s failed attempt to buy his own coverage, insurers found the Ningbo government was a client they couldn’t refuse. Participating providers have lowered their prices so the government can afford it because the program is too important to fail, according to people familiar with the arrangement who requested anonymity to discuss private details. Ningbo officials secured a discount of several million yuan on the annual premium for the three-year policy signed in 2021, one of the people said, even though the initial, higher price was based on the city’s growing climate risks calculated using scientific models. Catastrophe insurance is not a lucrative business in Ningbo, according to an executive at PICC Property and Casualty Co. Ltd., a top Chinese insurer that has been part of the program since 2014. “We are not after financial returns,” the executive said, asking not to be identified because they’re not authorized to speak to the media. When it comes to serving the government, “the political consideration outweighs anything else.” The Ningbo government and PICC did not respond to questions about the catastrophe insurance program. There is a potential risk for foreign investors backing the Chinese insurers that have been drawn into the programs. PICC has insured catastrophe risks for other provinces including Hebei, Sichuan and Zhejiang. China Life Insurance Co. Ltd., Asia’s biggest insurer, has sold policies to Henan’s government and Ping An Insurance Group Co of China Ltd. is among those supporting the technology hub Shenzhen. All three companies are listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange. Citigroup Inc. and BlackRock Inc., for example, hold 11% and 6% of PICC’s shares, respectively, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Chinese insurers don’t publish detailed profit breakdowns to establish how much these government deals have affected their bottom lines. But their experience in Ningbo in 2015 gives some indication. A consortium led by PICC lost about 56 million yuan due to a string of calamities that year, according to a 2022 analysis done by the insurer, Ningbo University and the local government. The disasters put the program “at risk of bankruptcy,” the authors noted, and “sounded an alarm about its future liabilities.” Yet a growing number of local authorities have struck similar deals with insurers, covering longer periods of time. Wang He, chair of the China Association of Actuaries, has spent years studying the country’s catastrophe insurance problem. The ongoing local trials aren’t sustainable without broader publicly funded mechanisms to support communities after disaster, he says. “Catastrophe risk management falls within the realm of public management,” says Wang. A lack of understanding of that “public nature” in China has led to “a simplistic approach of delegating the job to the insurance industry, which is ill-equipped to shoulder the entire responsibility.” Without a wider protection system, flood victims like Zheng don’t have much recourse. In 2015, after Ningbo started its catastrophe insurance program, the shopkeeper received the first payout of his life. It was 1,000 yuan ($140), even though the water destroyed thousands of yuan worth of bottled water, snacks and everyday essentials such as toothbrushes that he could no longer sell. Located some 150 miles south of Shanghai, Ningbo is a land of historic relics and modern skyscrapers. The 7,000-year-old city owes much of its prosperity to the East China Sea, which once helped Ningbo carve out a spot on the ancient Silk Road and continues to make it a vital trading hub. But the bustling coastal region is also a magnet for natural disasters. The city, home to nearly 10 million people, has been battered by more than 40 storms over the last two decades.While that first payout in 2015 left the insurers who sold the policy in deficit, the government was pleased with the 78 million yuan its residents received. It was almost twice what the government had spent on premiums. The apparent success convinced officials to turn the one-year pilot into a three-year deal. It also turned Ningbo into a shining example of how to deploy catastrophe insurance. Bureaucrats from all over China flocked to the city to learn how to replicate the program at home. But local governments across the country face the same dilemma as Ningbo. They’re trillions of yuan in debt and grappling with an economic slowdown that’s seen China’s government add a sweeping package of stimulus measures. There isn’t enough cash to dole out when disaster strikes; even investing in insurance policies can be a stretch. In 2021, when record rain battered Henan province in central China, killing nearly 400 people, relief spending ballooned to 100 million yuan in a matter of days. China said last year that it will issue 1 trillion yuan in special Treasury bonds to raise funds for future calamities. The central government typically allocates relief funds after an area is hit by destructive weather, but how much trickles down to individual households depends on how local authorities decide the money should be spent. China’s top leaders signaled this month that the nation will increase public borrowing and spending in 2025, but officials have so far been reluctant to directly hand out cash or significantly widen the social safety net. President Xi Jinping has warned against falling into a trap of “welfarism” or “feeding lazy people.” All that makes catastrophe insurance an appealing solution. Still, the policies are pricey because they guard against extreme risks and premiums are rising quickly as reinsurers brace for higher climate damages. The World Bank estimates that China will lose as much as 2.3% of its economic output to weather perils made worse by global warming by the end of this decade. The Ningbo Model — as the insurance program was dubbed by the Communist Party mouthpiece People’s Daily — has been held up as a win-win answer because it enlists the private sector to lessen the financial burden on the state and payments are quicker without having to deal with government red tape. But it also has some less appealing characteristics. Unlike traditional insurance, where payouts are commensurate with actual losses, Ningbo has a “parametric insurance” policy that only delivers compensation when certain thresholds are hit. A home inundated with, say, 7 inches of water might not meet the requirement for a payout if the trigger requires floodwaters to reach 7.8 inches. There’s also a cap on each payment. If their house collapses, a family only stands to receive a maximum payout of 10,000 yuan in a given year. An average house in Ningbo is worth 23,000 yuan per square meter. Since the program started, eligible households have received under 660 yuan each on average, less than 1% of the annual disposable income for the city’s residents. The insurers behind Ningbo’s program have gradually raised the upper limit for payouts, but how far they can go comes back to how much the government can afford in premiums. Ningbo is home to China’s second-busiest cargo port and a petrochemical industry worth $72 billion, helping it to weather China’s economic woes better than many of its neighbors. Even so, local officials rejected an informal proposal to turn its current three-year policy into a five-year arrangement, due in large part to concerns over the government’s ability to commit to the program long term, according to one of the people familiar with the deal. In recent years, the government has also added clauses to the policy that likely wouldn’t pass muster in the West. Starting from 2021, participating insurers are required to channel a chunk of their underwriting profits to Ningbo’s disaster relief fund if the city avoids major damages during their time of service. That, together with the push to raise compensation levels, has forced the insurers to operate on razor-thin margins, even in good years. The practice is “not widely used in commercial markets,” says Christopher Au, climate practice lead for Asia Pacific at insurance broker WTW. But because insurers can tap the relief fund under some circumstances if payouts exceed what they’ve collected in premiums, Au says the arrangement can also potentially help spread out their risk and reduce the volatility of profits and losses from year to year. To keep climate-induced losses at bay, Ningbo has improved its early-warning system for typhoons and moved some residents out of floodplains. But the insurance program is remains a cosmetic addition to the city’s arsenal of protection measures. All told, it offers a maximum coverage of 500 million yuan per year for natural catastrophes. A 2022 study published in Nature estimates that climate change will increase the frequency of super typhoons in Zhejiang province, where Ningbo sits, causing damages as high as 36 billion yuan on average every eight years by the end of the century. The intention was always for government-funded insurance to eventually translate into a more robust private market. In theory, as beneficiaries of the public program grew more familiar with the idea of insurance, they would start buying policies of their own. Yet less than 40% of Ningbo residents surveyed for the 2022 analysis expressed interest in purchasing their own catastrophe insurance. Local governments will likely remain the driving force behind any catastrophe insurance in China for the coming years, says Wang Xujin, executive director of the Insurance Society of China, an industry group. One way to keep premiums manageable for local governments is to scale up the program across the country, spreading risk over vast areas with different climate risks. That’s easier said than done. For one, some poorer local governments simply don’t have the resources to spare. It will also be extremely difficult to convince officials in lower-risk areas to split the bill with those that are more highly exposed, he says. There have been attempts within the central government to set up a national catastrophe insurance program, says Wuhan University’s Tian. But none of the talks have borne fruit. “The discussions always circle back to one issue,” she says. “Who pays?” Wang He, from the China Association of Actuaries, says he’s concluded there’s only one solution. China needs to build a “new national system” that establishes a disaster relief fund for the whole country financed by the central government and other financial instruments such as catastrophe bonds. Until then, Chinese officials are eager to point to the growing insurance program as evidence that they’re taking action. Ningbo’s government has touted it as a “shock absorber” for the economy that will help boost social stability. In Shiqiao, a canal-side suburb of Ningbo, a tailor surnamed Lin is mollified that the state is at least trying to do something about the constant flooding. Like Zheng, she also received an insurance payout of 1,000 yuan after waist-deep water inundated her home in 2022 and soaked a stockpile of new solar-powered water heaters she had planned to sell. “The 1,000 yuan is far from enough to cover my losses,” she says. “But it’s better than nothing.” Photograph: Ningbo has a parametric insurance policy that only delivers compensation when certain thresholds are hit.

By reducing costs and increasing transaction speed, BlackRock ETF’s adoption marks a pivotal step toward integrating blockchain into mainstream finance In a groundbreaking move, BlackRock’s ETF has purchased the first-ever municipal bond issued through blockchain technology. This marks a significant milestone for both traditional finance and the cryptocurrency industry. This development could reshape how bonds are issued and traded. It showcases blockchain’s growing potential in mainstream financial markets. BlackRock’s Municipal Income Bond ETF acquired the inaugural blockchain-issued bond from the Franklin Township in Ohio. The bond was created using Provenance Blockchain, an open-source platform designed for financial assets. This transaction sets a precedent for leveraging decentralized technology in municipal finance. “This transaction demonstrates the transformative potential of blockchain technology in improving efficiency and transparency in bond issuance,” said Franklin Township Treasurer, Amy Parker. The $15 million municipal bond will fund infrastructure projects within the township, including road and public works upgrades. The bond eliminates intermediaries by using blockchain, reducing issuance costs and increasing transaction speed. The acquisition by BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, highlights blockchain’s increasing adoption in institutional finance. Historically, municipal bonds were issued through traditional financial intermediaries, which often added complexity and costs. Blockchain streamlines this process by enabling direct peer-to-peer transactions. “Blockchain’s integration into municipal bonds opens the door for a more efficient and secure financial ecosystem,” said Larry Fink, BlackRock CEO. This move could encourage more institutions to explore blockchain for financial instruments, bridging the gap between traditional finance and decentralized systems. Adopting blockchain in municipal bonds could redefine the financial landscape, making it more accessible and transparent. Analysts believe this innovation could encourage smaller municipalities to consider blockchain-based bonds, especially since reduced costs make it more viable for low-budget projects. Additionally, investors stand to benefit from greater transparency. Blockchain’s immutable ledger ensures real-time tracking of bond transactions, enhancing accountability. “This technology democratizes access to investments while ensuring greater security and compliance,” noted David Treat, blockchain lead at Accenture. While this transaction is a significant step forward, adopting blockchain-based bonds will require further regulatory clarity and infrastructure development. BlackRock’s involvement provides credibility, signaling that blockchain is now integral to traditional finance rather than being confined to cryptocurrencies. Read Bitcoin’s [BTC] Price Prediction 2024–2025 As more institutional players recognize blockchain’s value, the divide between conventional finance and crypto continues to narrow. This convergence could pave the way for a future where blockchain underpins a broader range of financial products. In the words of Amy Parker, “This is just the beginning of a new era in finance where technology drives inclusivity and efficiency.” Disclaimer: AMBCrypto's content is meant to be informational in nature and should not be interpreted as investment advice.

Title: Is RingCentral (RNG) Among Billionaire Paul Singer’s Top Long-Term Stock Picks?
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ringcentral-rng-among-billionaire-paul-064219031.html
Time Published: 2024-12-19T06:42:19Z

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Billionaire Paul Singer’s Top 12 Long-Term Stock Picks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where RingCentral, Inc. (NYSE:RNG) stands against other Billionaire Paul Singer’s long-term stock picks. The world’s “most feared investor,” Paul Singer, needs no introduction. He has built a reputation on Wall Street for his aggressive and litigious tactics that often generate significant shareholder value. While the 79-year-old billionaire investor is not as flashy or public as other activist investors, he has built a reputation for exploiting weaknesses in various asset classes. Singer’s initial approach to investing was to target companies and even governments while purchasing extremely distressed debt. Therefore, he is best known as a “vulture capitalist” as a result of this tactic. Since then, he has diversified into a number of investment strategies, such as activist investing, portfolio management, and commodity trading. READ ALSO: Billionaire Daniel Sundheim’s Top 15 Stock Picks Heading Into 2025 and Billionaire David Tepper’s Top 10 Stock Picks Heading into 2025. Elliott Management is the investment firm that Singer founded in 1977 with $1.3 million. It has grown to become one of the most successful and feared activist hedge funds, with about $19 billion in portfolio value. The firm serves as the management affiliate for hedge funds Elliott Associates L.P and Elliott International Limited. The firm boasts of an annual average return of 14% since inception. Likewise, it has only lost money in the two years since its inception. Elliott Associates is one of the most tracked hedge funds and it employs an activist investment strategy. It also acquires significant though minority stakes in underperforming and distressed companies or assets with a view of unlocking long-term value. In addition, the firm strives to influence company management through strategic initiatives such as cost cuts, management changes and business sales to maximize shareholder value. Singer’s investment firm also purchased distressed sovereign debt from nations like Argentina and Peru in the 1990s. The investments resulted in multi-million dollar repayments following years of legal disputes. In 2016 Singer received a $2.4 billion payout after warring with Argentina’s government over bond payments. A 2018 article in The New Yorker magazine called him a “doomsday investor” for his strategies, including corporate debt plays in companies. Paul Singer’s investment record speaks for itself. His hedge fund, Elliott Management, returned 5.9% in 2022 as the S&P 500 went down 19%. Nevertheless, the firm underperformed in 2023, turning 4.3% compared to a 24% gain for the S&P 500. The underperformance came as Singer remained cautious amid concerns that The US economy was staring at an “extraordinarily dangerous and confusing period”. In addition to the high interest rates, the billionaire hedge fund manager raised concerns about the overstretched valuations and prospects of paltry returns in the real estate and financial services sector. Fast forward, the equity market has continued to edge higher in 2024. The S&P 500 is already up by more than 30%, with valuations in various counters getting out of hand. Nevertheless, macroeconomics shows improvement following the Federal Reserve’s bid to cut interest rates and steer the economy into a soft landing. As the Co-Chief Executive Officer and Co-Chief Investment Officer of Elliott Management, Singer has diversified his holdings as one of the ways of shrugging heightened volatility. Consequently, billionaire Paul Singer’s top 12 long-term stock picks are spread across the basic materials, services and utilities segments. There are also healthcare, energy, and financial services holdings. To make the list of billionaire Paul Singer’s top 12 long-term stock picks, we scanned Elliott Management’s investment portfolio. We then settled on stocks the hedge fund has held for two years and more. Finally, we ranked the stocks in ascending order based on Elliott Management’s stake value. At Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

(NYSE:RNG) offers cloud communications, video meetings, collaboration, and contact center software. Its main product, RingCentral Message Video Phone, unifies communication across different modes. The stock has risen 22.64% this year due to an expanding product lineup and new partnerships. RingCentral, Inc. (NYSE:RNG) has inked new alliances with Vodafone and Cox Communications. The successful introduction of new products like RingCX and strategic partnerships demonstrate RingCentral’s continued dedication to expansion and innovation in the communications industry. In addition, RingCentral, Inc. (NYSE:RNG) is also leveraging artificial intelligence to strengthen its product line, attracting more deals on the subscription front. The business unveiled new features for its AI-powered RingCX, such as sophisticated AI-based coaching insights for managers and supervisors and a real-time AI-powered assistant for agents and supervisors. The strategic partnerships and innovations catalyzed RingCentral, Inc.’s (NYSE:RNG) solid third-quarter results on November 7, 2024. Revenue was $609 million, representing a 9% year-over-year increase. The increase came as subscription revenues increased 10%. RingCentral also increased its monthly average recurring revenue by 9% to $2.48 billion. Overall, RNG ranks 7th on our list of Billionaire Paul Singer’s long-term stock picks. While we acknowledge the potential of RNG, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than RNG but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.
