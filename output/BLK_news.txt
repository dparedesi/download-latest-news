Leinster prop Thomas Clarkson could be in line for his Ireland international debut against Argentina next Friday night. Neither Tadhg Furlong or Tom O’Toole have been ruled out of the game but both must be considered doubtful, and although the 24-year-old Clarkson was initially named as one of five uncapped “training panellists”, there is no other tighthead in the squad. Clarkson was also involved in the captain’s run at the Aviva Stadium on Thursday before Friday night’s 23-13 loss against New Zealand, during which O’Toole was helped off within two minutes of coming on as a replacement for Finlay Bealham, who had to return and play until the end of the game. Bealham had started in place of the injured Furlong, who is unlikely to be risked after apparently aggravating the hamstring injury he had initially suffered on Leinster duty during Ireland’s training camp in Portugal. “You’d always hope when you’ve got a world-class tighthead that’s not fit, but we’ll see how that goes,” said Andy Farrell regarding the possibility of Furlong recovering to face Argentina, who continued their eye-catching progress under Felipe Contepomi with a 50-18 win over Italy in Udine on Saturday. “You’ve got to see how people pull up,” added Farrell. “You could see that Finlay had given his all, hadn’t he? He was pretty spent at times. There’s a few people like that so we’ll see how they pull up on Sunday.” Although O’Toole visibly staggered before being assisted off, he does not have to be stood down for a mandatory 12 days if he has no prior history of concussion. Clarkson, who began playing at Wicklow RFC and came through Blackrock College, was an ever-present in Ireland’s 2019 under-20 Grand Slam success and has accumulated 47 caps for Leinster. Allowing for this issue, it is not Farrell’s style to throw the baby out with the bathwater, not least in the wake of Ireland’s first home defeat in 3½ years. Farrell retained an unchanged team after last season’s Six Nations defeat in Twickenham as Ireland sealed back-to-back titles a week later against Scotland, albeit the head coach rejigged things when demoting Bundee Aki and Peter O’Mahony for the second Test victory in Durban last July. That victory was secured by two drop goals from Ciarán Frawley, albeit the Skerries man suffered an altogether contrasting experience last Friday night. Farrell opted to bring him on in the 58th minute for Jack Crowley despite Ireland leading at the time “just to freshen it up, give Frawls a chance”, said the Irish coach afterwards. “Sometimes it goes your way, sometimes it doesn’t.” But Farrell did intimate that he has a degree of rotation in mind over the month, with Argentina to be followed by Fiji, who had a historic 24-19 win over Wales in Cardiff on Sunday, as well as a fourth match against Joe Schmidt’s Australia, who have been buoyed by Saturday’s dramatic 42-37 win over England. “It’s a tough old month, four games back to back on the trot,” said Farrell. “So, we’ll see what the energy levels are like.” Frawley will come under consideration for his first Test start at outhalf after a contest that called into question Ireland’s game management as they adjust to life after the generational player that was Johnny Sexton. “Game-management is not just down to them, it’s down to others helping with the calls and seeing the space,” said Farrell of his inexperienced outhalves. “But, having said that, if you are playing you would expect yourself to hold on to the ball for more than a couple of phases, which we didn’t do at times.” Robbie Henshaw will come under consideration, as will Jamie Osborne, who won his third cap as a 70th-minute replacement for Garry Ringrose last Friday after performing admirably when starting both Tests in South Africa at fullback. Farrell might also look at Ireland’s starting back five in the pack and replacements in that sector, with a plethora of younger players such as Ryan Baird, Cormac Izuchukwu, Nick Timoney and Cian Prendergast itching to inject some fresh energy. Ireland’s defeat has removed them from the top of the world rankings to be published at noon on Monday, as New Zealand overtook them. What’s more, the Springboks’ 32-15 win over Scotland at Murrayfield saw them reclaim the number one spot, meaning Ireland will drop to third.

Bitcoin rallied past $80,000 for the first time on Sunday, boosted by President-elect Donald Trump’s embrace of digital assets and the prospect of a Congress featuring pro-crypto lawmakers.Trump was declared the winner in Arizona, marking a clean sweep of the seven US battleground states. His decisive victory in the US presidential election has prompted celebratory chest-thumping from the crypto industry, which spent more than $100 million backing a range of crypto-friendly candidates in the US election.“With the dust from Trump’s victory still settling down, it was only a matter of time before a run-up of some sort occurred given the perception of Trump being pro-crypto, and that’s what we’re seeing now,” said Le Shi, Hong Kong managing director at market-making firm Auros.The largest crypto token climbed as much as 4.7% to an unprecedented $80,092 before falling back to around $79,700 as of mid-morning in New York.Trump vowed on the campaign trail to put the US at the center of the digital-asset industry, including creating a strategic Bitcoin stockpile and appointing regulators enamored with digital assets.Bitcoin has added about 91% so far in 2024, helped by robust demand for dedicated US exchange-traded funds and interest-rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. The rise in the largest digital token, which scaled fresh records after the US vote, exceeds the returns from investments such as stocks and gold.The ETFs, powered by BlackRock Inc.’s $35 billion iShares Bitcoin Trust, posted a record daily net inflow of almost $1.4 billion on Thursday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Title: NVIDIA (NVDA) Stock: Ken Fisher’s AI Powerhouse with Unmatched Growth Potential

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Best Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Ken Fisher. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other best stocks to buy according to billionaire Ken Fisher. Ken Fisher is a prominent American investor and financial analyst, known for founding Fisher Investments in 1979. Born in San Francisco in 1950, he is the son of influential stock investor Philip A. Fisher. Fisher graduated from Humboldt State University with a degree in economics in 1972. He began his career in investment management and quickly made a name for himself through innovative approaches to investment theory. Under Fisher’s leadership, the firm has been recognized for its investment strategies and has consistently ranked among the top investment advisers in the U.S. For several years, Fisher Investments has been included in the Financial Times’ list of top Registered Investment Advisors. Fisher is also a best-selling author, having written multiple books on investment strategies, and he is known for popularizing concepts like the Price-to-Sales ratio as a tool for stock analysis Ken Fisher talked about the markets in a September 2024 video that was posted on his firm’s YouTube channel, Fisher Investments, and mentioned that he frequently gets asked about which sectors he believes will outperform or underperform over the next 18 months. He currently sees the market in the later stages, though not at the end, of a somewhat unusual bull market shaped by the unique challenges since COVID-19 began. As this bull market nears its two-year mark in October, he observes that while major trends may not shift significantly in the immediate future, technology stocks have consistently outperformed non-tech stocks since the market began to recover from the pandemic. Fisher noted that, when the market sees substantial movement, up or down by half a percent or more, technology stocks tend to follow that trend more intensely. Thus, if the market is expected to rise, tech stocks will likely perform well; conversely, they often lag during market downturns. Ken Fisher noted that as 2024 progressed, he expected value stocks to begin outperforming growth stocks more than they had in the past. While this expectation did not materialize in the first and second quarters, he observed that the trend started to emerge in the third quarter. However, he was surprised to see that energy stocks continued to underperform compared to most value stocks. “As 2024 progressed, and as I said in prior videos early in the year, I expected value to start doing better relative to growth than it had been before. And that didn’t really much happen in the first and second quarters. But in the third quarter of 2024, that’s largely happened, with the exception of the fact that energy, and I was completely wrong about this, energy has continued to do worse than most value.” Additionally, Fisher said that initially when the Fed began raising rates in 2022, many thought this would negatively impact growth stocks, a narrative he consistently disagreed with. Now, the sentiment is shifting again, suggesting that central bank rate cuts will benefit value stocks while adversely affecting growth stocks. This shift is logical because value stocks are more reliant on bank financing compared to growth stocks, which have various funding sources. As short-term interest rates decline relative to long-term rates and banks become more willing to lend, this scenario favors value stocks. Consequently, Fisher anticipates that the trend of value stocks narrowing the gap with growth stocks, seen in the third quarter, will continue into the fourth quarter and throughout much of the next year. Our Methodology This article explores the top ten stock holdings of Fisher Asset Management, based on 13F filings as of Q2 2024. The stocks are arranged in ascending order according to the stake of Fisher Asset Management, as of June 30, 2024. At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

The company’s positive outlook is bolstered by its leadership in the AI and machine learning sectors, where its GPUs are crucial for powering advanced applications, positioning NVIDIA to capitalize on the growing adoption of AI solutions across industries. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s data center segment is also experiencing rapid growth, fueled by the rise in AI and cloud computing as organizations migrate to these services, placing NVIDIA to capture a significant share of this expanding market. With a strong financial foundation, NVIDIA continues to invest heavily in research and development, ensuring it remains at the forefront of innovation. Its robust cash flow further enables strategic acquisitions and partnerships to drive accelerated growth. In Q3 2024, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) surpassed estimates, reporting a normalized EPS of $0.68, beating projections by $0.04, with revenue of $30.04 billion, exceeding forecasts by $1.29 billion. As NVIDIA approaches its Q4 earnings report on November 20, 2024, analysts project a normalized EPS of $0.74 and revenue of $32.94 billion. Over the last 90 days, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has received 32 upward EPS revisions, reflecting strong investor confidence in its sustained momentum and leadership within the semiconductor industry. ClearBridge Large Cap Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “This focus on consistency also guides our regular trimming of strong performers to manage stock-specific and overall portfolio risk. The quarter saw us continue to trim NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), reducing the GPU chipmaker from an active weight in the portfolio to an underweight versus the benchmark. We continue to believe in Nvidia’s 10-year trajectory as hyperscaler and enterprise customers invest in GPU architecture. However, we have reduced our Nvidia position as its valuation now more fully reflects the company’s robust growth path and as estimates have risen to levels that require a very steep growth trajectory to drive further stock appreciation.” Overall, NVDA ranks 3rd on our list of best stocks to buy according to billionaire Ken Fisher. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than the ones on our list but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Massive Day For BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF As Trading Volume Reaches Unseen Levels With $4.1 Billion Traded
URL: https://www.benzinga.com/24/11/41869353/massive-day-for-blackrocks-bitcoin-etf-as-trading-volume-reaches-unseen-levels-with-4-1-billion-traded

On Nov. 6, BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) achieved an unprecedented trading milestone, with volume spiking to $4.1 billion in a single day – its highest ever. This surge, following Donald Trump's reelection as President of the United States, signals a potent wave of institutional and potentially retail interest in cryptocurrency ETFs. Don't Miss: Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas noted on X (formerly Twitter) that this massive trading volume exceeded that of established stocks like Berkshire Hathaway, Netflix and Visa, making it an extraordinary day for Bitcoin on the ETF front. To add perspective, many Bitcoin ETFs also saw a significant uptick, trading at nearly twice their typical volume. This is reminiscent of Bitcoin ETFs’ highly volatile early days in January. Analysts attribute this remarkable performance to a mix of factors, including Bitcoin's price momentum, which saw the asset climb to a record high of $76,500. However, based on TradingView data shortly after, the asset's price dipped slightly to $75,267. Nevertheless, it remains one of the dominant assets in 2024's ETF outlook. Trending: 1 in 4 Americans own a share of Bitcoin according to NASDAQ — this platform touts returns as high as 12.5% APY and is giving $100 in welcome rewards if you sign up today. As ETF Store president Nate Geraci highlighted in an X post, Bitcoin ETFs have become some of the most successful launches this year. Additionally, Trump's return to office has sparked optimism in the crypto space, with many pointing to his pro-crypto stance and anticipated policy support as potential catalysts for Bitcoin's continued growth. As Bitcoin ETFs break new ground, the broader landscape has seen asset managers scramble to file for a range of altcoin-focused ETFs, including those for Solana, XRP and Litecoin. They've also proposed several crypto index ETFs, allowing investors to hold diversified digital assets. Balchunas previously described these filings as "call options on a Trump victory," indicating that fund managers may be banking on a favorable regulatory climate under the new administration. Should pro-crypto policies become a reality, experts believe the market may see even more significant inflows and innovations in the ETF space. See Also: Dogecoin millionaires are increasing – investors with $1M+ in DOGE revealed! However, it's not all rosy for Bitcoin purists. Some argue that the rising influence of financial giants like BlackRock could undermine Bitcoin's foundational decentralization ethos. The concern is that as these firms accumulate substantial Bitcoin holdings, they could inadvertently centralize control, threatening the independence that originally attracted many to cryptocurrency. An anonymous crypto analyst noted that while ETFs add stability to Bitcoin's market presence, they may also consolidate assets in traditional institutions' hands, potentially conflicting with the decentralized ideals that underpin the crypto space. The political climate is also adding complexity. A recent CryptoSlate report suggested that shifts in U.S. policy, especially following Trump's election, could significantly sway crypto ETF inflows. Furthermore, changes in the U.S. administration can send ripples through the market, potentially creating both opportunities and volatility. With Trump's pro-crypto stance, some analysts, like Fadi Aboualfa, head of research at Copper.co, predict that Bitcoin's price could reach $100,000 by his inauguration on January 20.

In Q3 2024, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) exceeded expectations with a normalized EPS of $3.30, beating estimates by $0.20, and reported revenue of $65.59 billion, surpassing forecasts by $1.03 billion. As the next earnings report approaches on January 23, 2025, analysts anticipate a normalized EPS of $3.14 and revenue of $68.98 billion. With 24 upward EPS revisions in the past 90 days, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) demonstrates strong momentum and sustained investor confidence in its growth potential. Generation Investment Management Global Equity Strategy stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q2 2024 investor letter: “Generative AI’s hunger for power has increased disproportionately with its intelligence. According to one estimate, OpenAI’s GPT-4 required 50 gigawatt hours (GWh) of electricity to train, much more than the 1.3 GWh needed for GPT-3.3 And then AI requires even more power when it is put to use (so called ‘inference’). Some of the latest trends worry us. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) appears to be slipping in its ESG goals, with its greenhouse gas emissions rising again last year, as it invests in becoming a big player in AI. Overall, MSFT ranks 1st on our list of best stocks to buy according to Billionaire Ken Fisher. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Title: AIL round-up: St Mary’s shine on return to Division 1A with spiky win over rivals Terenure

For St Mary’s, it was almost worth the wait or must have felt like it anyway. Caelan Doris, Dan Sheehan and Peter O’Mahony were among a boisterous and engaged crowd of about 3,500 – the biggest at Templeville Road in many years – as the home side confirmed they are back in Division 1A after a seven-year absence with a vengeance courtesy of an eventful and spiky 32-22 over local rivals Terenure on Saturday. Terenure looked well placed after recovering from a blistering start by the home side to lead 15-10 at half-time through well-worked tries by lively hooker Max Russell and classy full-back Adam La Grue. But Mary’s again stormed out of the blocks and the game pivoted on two quickfire tries by centre Myles Carey, albeit the second clearly followed a knock forward in the air from Conor Dean’s up-and-under which somehow all three officials missed. Soon after Jordan Coghlan was held up over the Mary’s line, the influential Greg Jones stole a close-range line-out and Terenure out-half Caspar Gabriel kicked a penalty to the corner dead. But there was no disputing the merits of the Mary’s win and a second try by winger Michael Silvester further rewarded their ploy of attacking ‘Nure on the edges. Whereas Terenure left pointless for the first time this season, a fifth attacking bonus point helped elevate Mary’s into second above Clontarf on points’ difference after the latter’s hard-earned 26-20 win at home to Young Munster. Ballynahinch, including Jake Flannery, Aaron Sexton and Zac Ward, underlined their title credentials when Conor Rankin’s late penalty completed a 27-25 bonus point win away to an injury-hit Lansdowne. The champions Con trailed City of Armagh by 19-7 before converted tries through Daniel Hurley, Scott Buckley and Ronán O’Sullivan in a 28-26 win, but Niall Carville burrowed over late on to earn the home side two bonus points. UCD moved above Garryowen at the foot of the table with a vital 29-19 win at Dooradoyle despite a hat-trick by home captain Donnacha Byrne. The 1B leaders Old Belvedere scored eight tries in a 57-21 win at home Highfield, while Nenagh Ormond stayed second with a 22-14 win over Queen’s as UCC and Naas lost ground. Corinthians’ young guns moved clear in 2A with a 31-14 win at Barnhall, their fifth of six wins with a bonus point, as Cashel lost at home to Navan and Instonians went second with a 35-17 at home to Old Crescent.

Skip to comments. Posted on 11/10/2024 10:57:49 AM PST by dynachrome History-making ski resort Ukraine’s gas station network OKKO Group says it’s planning to invest $1.5 billion in a new ski resort in western Ukraine in what could potentially be the country’s largest investment in history. OKKO Group has said it started construction of the Goro Mountain Resort near Slavske — the company is putting $500 million into the resort and plans to attract an additional $1 bn from external investors. The resort is set to open for skiing in the winter of 2026–2027, with plans for full completion by 2039, and is envisioned as a premium destination to rival Bukovel, Ukraine’s leading ski resort. The project was first announced eight years ago but was delayed. The resort will span 75 kilometers of ski slopes. The construction is supported by a partnership with the Ukrainian government through its "investment nanny" initiative that provides expedited land allocation and tax exemptions to enhance the project’s viability.

My reaction as well. I thought this was a country engaged in a war for its very existence, and resources are going to this kind of thing? Someone has a very clear vision of what the future of Ukraine will be, and it’s not one in which the nation has any lack of pastimes for the wealthy... ALL of it. This was always a war to drain US and allied resources. I won’t be surprised if one day soon tensions between Ukraine and Russia just evaporate and the media goes completely silent as if it never happened. Well, the BlackRock and other fat cat corporate execs and the contractors getting big checks and bonuses compliments of US taxpayers will need some R&R and a place to spend their money once the reconstruction spigot starts flowing. A ski resort sounds perfect. Seriously, do they realize how their crowing about this does not set well with beleaguered American taxpayers? taxpayers trying to figure out how to afford groceries and moved to tears seeing our homeless veterans reduced to living in on sidewalks? Obla dee Obla da life goes on BRAH la la la la life goes on. We don’t have no steenkin war, it is US forces pretending to be NATO, and the Ukes are the cannon fodder. One thing the Americans are good at is sending young boys into the grinder, ala Vietnam, Korea, Libya and Afghanistan. Hell, Veterans day weekend, and there are still POW’s left in SE Asia. You see, a Senator from AZ and President GHW Bushitter said so. In case you think I am dogging on the servicemen who train, live and die for this country, I am not. My entire family served in one war or another, sans yours truly. I am talking about a lot of people. Grandma had 3 sons, 5 daughters. I have 33 first cousins. Two brothers who served, 20 first cousins who were in Korea or Vietnam. My brother was State leader of the POW-MIA group that pushed for return. The only thing worse than war itself, is how we treat those who served, and were left behind. Citizens still in Afghanistan from Bidens “flee policy”.

Title: Alpha Metallurgical Resources, Inc. (AMR): A Bull Case Theory

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We came across a bullish thesis on Alpha Metallurgical Resources, Inc. (AMR) on The Chop Wood, Carry Water Newsletter’s Substack by Alexandru Dragut. In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on AMR. Alpha Metallurgical Resources, Inc. (AMR)'s share was trading at $239.02 as of Nov 7th. AMR’s trailing P/E was 8.76, according to Yahoo Finance. Copyright: vyacheslavsvetlichnyy / 123RF Stock Photo Alpha Metallurgical Resources (AMR) presents a compelling investment case within the metallurgical coal industry, a sector vital for steel production. With extensive reserves in Appalachia, AMR supplies premium coal to global markets, maintaining strong partnerships with steelmakers that enhance its resilience through industry cycles. In Q3 2024, AMR reported a substantial 42% increase in liquidity from the previous quarter, reaching $150.3 million in cash reserves. This liquidity enables the company to weather periods of low coal demand and price volatility without heavily relying on debt, safeguarding shareholder value while providing flexibility for reinvestment and growth. AMR’s global reach further strengthens its position, enabling it to meet increasing demand from emerging and developed markets, particularly in Asia and Europe, where steel demand is growing. Operational efficiency has been a cornerstone of AMR’s strategy, with rigorous cost controls that help maintain profitability even amid recent declines in coal prices. This focus on cost management has allowed AMR to sustain its profit margins, highlighting its adaptability to both favorable and challenging market conditions. Financially, AMR’s recent performance underscores its resilience. The company reported trailing 12-month revenue of $3.3 billion, a slight decline from last year due to lower coal demand driven by the shift towards renewable energy. AMR’s profit margin has decreased from 20% to 11%, reflecting the impact of falling coal prices on its bottom line. Despite this, AMR remains profitable, benefiting from its efficient cost structure. Its strong free cash flow margin of 15% further demonstrates effective capital management, reinforcing the company’s financial stability and operational efficiency. From a valuation perspective, AMR’s low trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 8.88 signals a potential undervaluation, especially for investors focused on earnings potential and cash generation. This low P/E suggests the market may not fully recognize AMR’s cash-generating capabilities, making it an attractive opportunity for value investors. Additionally, AMR’s minimal debt load strengthens its financial flexibility, reducing risk while allowing it to navigate economic uncertainties with confidence. The company’s strategic use of free cash flow, combined with its strong liquidity position, positions it to explore growth opportunities or sustain steady operations during downturns. Looking ahead, AMR is well-placed to benefit from the anticipated increase in global steel demand, driven by infrastructure projects and economic growth in emerging markets. As a low-cost producer with high-quality reserves, the company stands to capture this growth. However, investors should remain mindful of the cyclical risks and regulatory challenges inherent to the coal industry, including potential regulatory costs as the world pivots towards renewable energy. Despite these challenges, AMR’s disciplined financial strategy, robust liquidity, and strong market positioning offer a favorable risk/reward balance, aligning well with value-driven investment principles and providing a solid foundation for long-term growth potential. Alpha Metallurgical Resources, Inc. (AMR) is not on our list of the 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 24 hedge fund portfolios held AMR at the end of the second quarter which was 26 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the risk and potential of AMR as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMR but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) the Best Stock to Buy and Hold for 5 Years?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold For 5 Years. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other best stocks to buy and hold for 5 years. On November 7, Reuters reported that stocks in the United States were higher than usual after the Fed announced a 25 basis point rate cut, extending the rally fueled by the election results. The Fed decision came promptly after the job market showed signs of easing and inflation moved towards the Central Bank’s target of 2%. Most investors expect the new administration to ease taxes and regulations, all of which sparked all three of the major indexes. The S&P 500 and Dow, each logged their largest one-day percentage jumps in two years. Now that the elections are over, investors are keen to know how will markets perform amid election results. On November 8, Bethany McLean, contributing editor at Vanity Fair, joined Catalysts on Yahoo Finance to discuss why businesses may be optimistic as the new president takes over the White House. McLean emphasizes that investors foresee a myriad of benefits such as tax cut extensions, fewer regulations, and less aggressive antitrust oversight, all of which have sparked a surge in markets. Despite the possible benefits, she emphasizes it is difficult to predict what the administration is going to do at the moment. McLean expects the new administration to be friendlier with companies in the technology sector, however, she remains fixated on waiting to see how the policies play out. She further adds that if any future policies made by the new administration negatively impact the stock market, she expects them to “switch course.” On the flip side, some analysts maintain that the easing cycle has a greater bearing on the stock market than the elections, hinting that value names may be more important as of now. On November 7, Arup Datta, senior vice president at Mackenzie Global Quantitative, joined Wealth! on Yahoo Finance to share his market thesis as the 2024 elections come to a close. Datta shares that he is extremely positive about the market but emphasizes that the win will have little impact on financial markets in the long term. Speaking of the magnificent seven, he adds focusing on quality names with positive growth and value for his investment portfolio helps him navigate the market in such conditions. He suggests that while the magnificent seven have been the talk of the town for the past 18 to 21 months, he would like to “pivot away” from that by a little. Historically, value stocks have performed better amid an easing cycle, adds Datta. As the new administration settles in and the Fed initiates its second cut of the cycle, the near-term market will most likely remain volatile. Speaking of the future, some names happen to promise long-term growth due to their proprietary revolutionary technologies and crucial investments. To come up with the 10 best stocks to buy and hold for 5 years, we sifted through multiple similar rankings and compiled an initial list of 20 stocks. We then ranked the top 10 based on their hedge fund sentiment at the end of Q2 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Photo by Christian Wiediger on Unsplash Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 179 NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks third on our list of the best stocks to buy and hold for 5 years. NVIDIA is a leading GPU maker driving innovation in artificial intelligence, gaming, creative design, autonomous vehicles, and robotics. There is no doubt about NVIDIA’s position in the technology and AI sector. As part of its recent updates, On October 29, the company revealed Enterprise Reference Architectures. These blueprints will help the company’s partners and customers build AI factories. More recently, on November 6, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) partnered with Hugging Face to fuel open-source AI robotics research and development. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is scheduled to release earnings towards the end of this month, on November 20, 2024. In light of its awaited earning release, on October 19, Vivek Arya analyst at Bank of America, joined CNBC to defend his bullish call on NVDA. Having called the stock a “generational opportunity,” Arya emphasizes that NVDA is trading less than one times its earnings growth, much lower than other names in the magnificent seven. He suggests that NVDA celebrates a large ecosystem encompassing “end-to-end” knowledge, placing it ahead of competitors. Overall, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is on our list because of its resources and expertise in scalable AI hardware and software solutions. At the end of Q2 2024, 179 hedge funds were bullish on the stock, according to our Insider Monkey database. Ithaka Group’s Ithaka US Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter: “NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the market leader in visual computing through the production of high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs). The company targets four large and growing markets: Gaming, Professional Visualization, Data Center, and Automotive. NVIDIA’s products have the potential to lead and disrupt some of the most exciting areas of computing, including: data center acceleration, artifi cial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and autonomous driving. The reason for the stock’s appreciation in the quarter was twofold: First, the stock benefi ted from tremendous excitement surrounding the further development of generative AI and the likelihood this would necessitate the purchase of a large number of Nvidia’s products far into the future; Second, Nvidia posted another strong beat[1]and-raise quarter, where the company upped its F2Q25 revenue guidance above Street estimates, showcasing its dominant position in the buildout of today’s accelerated computing infrastructure.” Overall, NVDA ranks 3rd on our list of best stocks to buy and hold for 5 years. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Its primary offerings include memory and storage products for computers, consumer electronics, artificial intelligence use cases, servers, and automobiles. Speaking of artificial intelligence, on October 15, Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) launched a new portfolio of memory solutions that are capable of fueling the new wave of AI PCs. Its corporate vice president, Dinesh Bahal, stresses the need for a memory paradigm shift as AI takes flight.

Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) is shifting its complete focus to meeting the demands for artificial intelligence and data center customers, two of the fastest-growing industries at the moment. The company expects demand for AI servers to continue to increase, positioning it as a major player in AI. Baird Chautauqua International and Global Growth Fund stated the following regarding Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “After Micron Technology, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:MU) price appreciated 54% in 1H24, investors became anxious about potential memory weakness, less clear cyclical recovery pace, and whether competitor Samsung will act rationally with capacity expansion. We maintain our long-term positive view on the industry’s demand/supply situation. We believe Micron is well positioned in technology capability, and that its margins will continue to improve.” Overall, MU ranks 6th on our list of best stocks to buy and hold for 5 years.

Title: Bond market on risky path as traders regroup from turbulent week

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. (Bloomberg) -- The bond-market selloff unleashed by Donald Trump’s presidential victory last week ended almost as quickly as it began. Most Read from Bloomberg The Leaf Blowers Will Not Go Quietly Arizona Elections Signal Robust Immigration Enforcement Under Trump Scoring an Architectural Breakthrough in Denver’s RiNo District Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races Highlight Views on Abortion, Immigration Yet firms like BlackRock Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and TCW Group Inc. have issued a steady drumbeat of warnings that the bumpy ride is likely far from over. Trump’s coming return to the White House has significantly upended the outlook for the US Treasury market, where October’s losses had already wiped out much of this year’s gains. Less than two months after the Federal Reserve started pulling interest rates back from a more than two-decade high, the likelihood that Trump will cut taxes and throw up large tariffs is threatening to rekindle inflation by raising import costs and pouring stimulus on an already strong economy. His fiscal plans — unless offset by massive spending cuts — would also send the federal budget deficit surging. And that, in turn, has renewed doubts about whether bondholders will start demanding higher yields in return for absorbing an ever-rising supply of new Treasuries. One scenario is “the bond market instills fiscal discipline with an unpleasant rise in rates,” said Janet Rilling, senior portfolio manager and the head of the Plus Fixed Income team at Allspring Global Investments. She predicted the 10-year Treasury yield could rise back to the peak of 5% hit in late 2023, about 70 basis points above where it was Friday. That “was the cycle high and it’s a reasonable level if there is a full implementation of the proposed tariffs.” There remains considerable uncertainty about the precise policies Trump will enact, and some of the potential impact has already been priced in, since speculators started betting on his victory well ahead of the vote. While 10- and 30-year Treasury yields surged Wednesday to the highest in months, they came tumbling back down again over the next two days, ending the week lower than they began. A Bloomberg index of Treasury returns was up just 1.4% as of Friday’s close. There’s no cash Treasuries trading on Monday due to a US holiday. But the prospect that Trump’s policies will spur growth has driven traders to pare back expectations for how deeply the the Fed will cut rates next year, dashing hopes that bonds would rally as it eased policy aggressively. Economists at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Barclays Plc and JPMorgan have shifted their Fed forecasts to show fewer reductions. Swaps traders are pricing in that policymakers will reduce its benchmark rate to 4% by mid-2025, a full percentage point higher than they were predicting in September. It’s in a range of 4.5% to 4.75% now. The coming week’s economic data, particularly the latest reading on consumer and producer prices, may spark renewed volatility. Fed Chair Jerome Powell, New York Fed president John Williams and Fed Governor Christopher Waller are also set to speak, providing potentially fresh insights on their outlooks. Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis President Neel Kashkari said Sunday the US economy has remained remarkably strong as the central bank progressed in beating back inflation, though the Fed was still “not all the way home.” What Bloomberg Strategists Say ... “Election trades are set for a bit of a breather as punters looks to recalibrate risk and sweep a bit of profit off the table. This is kind of what we saw in the aftermath of the election in 2016; after a big rally the day after, the S&P moved sideways for a few days before taking off again. The rise in Treasury yields was more consistent and pronounced, but then again the Fed was on the verge of re-starting its rate-hike normalization, not in the midst of an easing cycle.” Cameron Crise, macro strategist For the full report, click here Rick Rieder, BlackRock’s chief investment officer for global fixed income, has been telling investors they shouldn’t expect bond prices to rise from here. He said the recent backup is a chance to lock in elevated yields on short-term bonds, but he remains cautious about longer-term debt given the current uncertainty. After the Fed meeting Thursday, he said in a note to clients that the previous day’s selloff had made short-term yields “extremely attractive.” But “venturing out to the wild blue yonder of longer-term interest rates,” he added, is “maybe not worth that excitement (or the volatility).” Others see risk the bond market has further room to fall. JPMorgan’s Bob Michele, the chief investment officer and head of global fixed income at its asset management arm, is among those warning that 10-year Treasury yields may eventually climb back to 5% after Trump takes office. At Amundi SA, Europe’s biggest asset manager, CIO Vincent Mortier has flagged that point too, saying it’s a “real alert level” that could ripple into the equity market by driving investors to shift cash over to bonds. After the Fed cut rates for its second straight meeting on Thursday, Powell declined to speculate on how Trump’s plans may affect the bank’s path and said it wasn’t clear that the recent rise in yields will hold. But analysts widely expect the next Trump administration to worsen the federal deficit, which has already swelled under President Joe Biden. The Committee for a Responsible Budget last month estimated Trump’s plans would increase the debt by $7.75 trillion more than what’s currently projected through fiscal year 2035. “At some point, an increasing deficit and debt servicing, all things equal, should lead to a higher yield premium,” said Ruben Hovhannisyan, fixed-income portfolio manager at TCW Group. “The question is the degree of how much more fiscal deficits will grow under this administration.” What to Watch Economic data: Nov. 12: NFIB small business optimism; Fed’s senior loan officer survey Nov. 13: MBA mortgage applications; real average earnings; Consumer Price Index; monthly budget statement Nov. 14: Producer price index; jobless claims Nov. 15: Empire manufacturing; retail sales; import and export price index; industrial production; capacity utilization; business inventories Fed calendar: Nov. 12: Fed Governor Christopher Waller; Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin; Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker Nov. 13: Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan; St. Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem; Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid Nov. 14: Barkin; Fed chair Powell; New York Fed President John Williams Auction calendar: Nov. 12: 13-, 26-week bills; 42-day CMB Nov. 13: 17-week bills Nov. 14: 4-, 8-week bills --With assistance from Julien Ponthus and Ruth Carson.

Bitcoin rallied past $80,000 (€74,621) for the first time, boosted by US president-elect Donald Trump’s embrace of digital assets and the prospect of a Congress featuring pro-crypto lawmakers. The cryptocurrency climbed as much as 4.7 per cent to an unprecedented $80,092 on Sunday. Trump vowed on the campaign trail to put the US at the centre of the digital-asset industry, including creating a strategic Bitcoin stockpile and appointing regulators enamoured with digital assets. He emerged from Tuesday’s election in a stronger position than expected – his Republican Party has control of the Senate and is on the verge of holding a narrow majority in the House. “With the dust from Trump’s victory still settling down, it was only a matter of time before a run-up of some sort occurred given the perception of Trump being pro-crypto, and that’s what we’re seeing now,” said Le Shi, Hong Kong managing director at market-making firm Auros. Bitcoin has added about 91 per cent so far in 2024, helped by robust demand for dedicated US exchange-traded funds and interest-rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. The rise in the largest digital token, which scaled fresh records after the US vote, exceeds the returns from investments such as stocks and gold. The ETFs, powered by BlackRock Inc.’s $35 billion iShares Bitcoin Trust, posted a record daily net inflow of almost $1.4 billion on Thursday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A day earlier, the iShares ETF’s trading volume jumped to an all-time peak – all signs of how Trump’s victory is reshaping crypto. Trump’s stance contrasts with a crackdown on digital assets under President Joe Biden. Securities & Exchange Commission chairman Gary Gensler repeatedly labelled the sector as rife with fraud and misconduct. The agency turned the screws on crypto following a 2022 market rout and a litany of collapses, notably the bankruptcy of Sam Bankman-Fried’s fraudulent FTX exchange. Digital-asset companies and executives spent heavily during the US election campaign to promote candidates viewed as favourable toward their interests. “Trump has promised supportive regulation, and the sweep of the House and the Senate makes the passage of crypto bills much more likely,” wrote Noelle Acheson, author of the Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter. – Bloomberg Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Wall Street Missed The Memo On These Bond Yields Up To 13%

Abstract creative stats data concept with hands typing on laptop on background. Multiexposure It’s a party on Wall Street! While the suits fawn over the hot “Trump trade” stocks, we dividend investors are going to dumpster dive. Hey, we have no shame. We’re talking about yields from 7.8% to 13.4%, paid monthly! Why the bargains? Bonds have been bloodied since the Federal Reserve cut rates. Wait, what? Let’s remember the Fed guides short-term rates. Long-term rates , on the other hand, march to the beat of their own drum: Rates Rebound We could dip into bond exchange-traded funds (ETFs)—they’ll have the same tailwind at their back. But I prefer CEFs over bland ETFs for three very simple reasons: Note the emphasis on “some.” Once it was clear a bull run in bonds was a certainty, some CEFs’ discounts vanished and haven’t returned. But fortunately for us, other CEFs are still trading for less than they’re worth—while delivering an average of 10% in monthly income, no less. Legit bargains, or cheap for a reason? Let’s explore. We’ll begin with an oddball that goes a little against the grain of our theme: the PGIM Short Duration High Yield Bond Fund (SDHY). This offering from PGIM—which is part of Prudential Investment Management—plays on the short end of the yield curve. Specifically, SDHY’s managers try to maintain a weighted average portfolio duration of three years tops, and a weighted average maturity of no more than five years. SDHY has decent-enough credit quality for a corporate junk fund, with 47% in BB-rated bonds, and another 26% in Bs. Interestingly enough, more than 10% of the portfolio is in investment-grade corporates. If this was a plain-vanilla short-duration ETF, even on the junkier side, we could expect fairly low volatility. Not so here. That’s because SDHY utilizes a fair amount of debt leverage, at more than 20% currently. That means an awfully bumpy ride during downturns, as investors found out throughout 2022. But, near the end of the year, I pointed out that SDHY “has significant potential once the Fed starts slowing its hike pace (and especially once it actually throttles back rates).” And it did! This PGIM fund trades at a smaller discount now (6%) than it did then (10%), but we’re still buying its bonds cheaper than we could on the open market, and we’re getting a nearly 8% yield, paid monthly, to boot. But unlike these other funds, SDHY needs the Fed to keep its thumb pressed down on the interest rates we can see—if there are signs the Fed’s rate-cutting cycle will take a prolonged pause, this CEF’s juice could quickly run dry. Western Asset High Income Fund II (HIX) is ostensibly a high-yield corporate fund, but it’s a little more complicated than that. For one, it’s global; however, the U.S. makes up roughly 60% of the portfolio, while all other countries are 5% or less of assets. HIX has five double-digit sectors—four of them are actual corporate market sectors (consumer cyclical, communications, energy, and finance), and the fifth is emerging-market government bonds. From a maturity perspective, it’s a mid-range fund—not as short-duration-focused as SDHY, but much of its allocation is bunched in the 5- to 10-year range. And not only does HIX utilize a heavy 30% in debt leverage, but it also puts options and derivatives to use, which is how it manages to squeeze a jaw-dropping 13% out of its otherwise ho-hum portfolio. Unfortunately, for all of its fits and starts, it can’t even pull away from basic junk funds over time, and it trails its benchmark over every meaningful time period. I don’t love turning away from a double-digit yield, but that much income has only brought HIX to par. To make matters worse, HIX has the smallest discount of all four funds here, at less than 3% currently. The last time I looked at Allspring Income Opportunities Fund (EAD), back in 2020, it traded as the Wells Fargo Income Opportunities Fund. But a year later, GTCR and Reverence Capital Partners bought up Wells Fargo Asset Management, and renamed the resultant new company Allspring Global Investments. New moniker, but the fund still has the same thrust. EAD invests in junk of all sorts—not just high-yield bonds, but also below-investment-grade loans and preferred stocks. It’s technically a global fund, but nearly 90% of the portfolio is U.S.-based; the rest is a sprinkling of mostly developed foreign markets including Canada, Germany and France. Allspring’s CEF is even more aggressive with leverage, at around 30%. That’s why, like with HIX, we’ll see wild swings compared to bare-bones junk ETFs. But over time, EAD finds itself farther and farther ahead despite deep pullbacks when the bond markets go cold. EAD will probably benefit from a tamping down of long-term rates. But I do wonder about its price right now. Its current 7% discount to NAV is only a little slimmer than its five-year average discount of 8%. But historically, we could do a lot better waiting for a wider discount. The BlackRock Credit Allocation Income Trust (BTZ) is a multisector bond fund that’s happy to dabble in just about everything. It’s heaviest in traditional fixed income–roughly 65% of the fund is allocated to investment-grade bonds (35%) and junk (29%). But it also has significant exposure to non-U.S. developed-market sovereigns and securitized products, and a smattering of bank loans and emerging-market debt. We’re also getting solid credit quality, with a roughly 60/40 split of investment-grade to junk. And BTZ is in our sweet spot on the yield curve, with a weighted average life to maturity of nearly 22 years. One reason I like looking at BTZ is it exemplifies how CEFs benefit from active management and having more tools to work with. Managers can hunt down value-priced bonds rather than just plugging in whatever an index tells them to, and they’re also able to scour the credit world for other appealing instruments at times when bonds aren’t the top play. They can also push the pedal down on leverage—BTZ is using a high 35% right now. That’s why we’ll get volatility like this, but also outperformance compared to other actively managed ETFs in the multibond space. A wild 9%-plus yield, paid monthly, further pads the case.

Title: Time to embrace ‘re-sign’ from resign

Use headhunters, advertise on social media, post it on job portals, or launch an attractive employee referral programme? How about your alumni pool? Have you observed your colleagues nostalgically reminiscing about the past when they bump into ex-colleagues? Many enterprises are taking advantage of these relationships. The recent news of Cognizant rehiring 13,000 ex-employees is a clever employer branding move. A rehiring ratio of 3-5 per cent is common in large IT services companies, given that most have lost close to 50,000 employees a year over the last four years due to attrition. But by broadcasting these rehiring numbers, Cognizant sure got the attention of its alumni. With 12-20 per cent attrition in most enterprises today, alumni are a significant proportion of trained talent in the market, working for competitors or otherwise. But is rehiring your former colleagues that easy? “I want to start the next new employee induction session with ‘How to Quit’,” said one of my CHRO — chief human resources officer — friends at a party. He was frustrated by how people were quitting in bizarre ways. He said some of his colleagues texted their resignations, they were unwilling to serve notice periods, switched off during notice periods, and even ghosted after handing in their letter. Corporates look to tread the India Way RNT: Judging a leader’s true nature Flat organisation believers: Can you imagine a world without managers? Rehiring, hence, is an emotionally charged affair in many cases, as former employees have indulged in practices that their ex-managers may deem unacceptable. Even if you want to hire them in other teams, the ex-manager’s emotions can come into play. In cases where the ex-manager seeks to rehire, someone else in the team or HR will pose obstacles like “Can they come at the old salary? We have their peers who stayed back, and we don’t want to set an example that one can quit and come back at a higher salary”. Ironically, we will be okay hiring a rank stranger at a higher salary, and further risk the recruiting experiment, over cultural- and skill-fit alumni. Once I was anchoring a leadership meeting discussing the boomerang hiring of about 10 ex-employees. The meeting turned into a war zone, with the tirade ranging from why we shouldn’t rehire anyone, to why we hire alumni without their ex-managers’ consent, and why we shouldn’t glorify employees’ return at the cost of stayers. According to attrition data in annual reports, the top eight Indian IT service bellwethers have had a staggering 17.15 lakh exits over the last five years. During this period, their collective headcount grew from 14.75 lakh to 19.85 lakh, an addition of 5 lakh employees. The top 10 Indian private banks had 2.8 lakh exits over the last five years. In that period, their collective net headcount increased from 4 lakh to 7.6 lakh, a growth of 3.6 lakh employees. The coveted FAANMG (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Microsoft, Google) cluster in India saw ⁠over 1 lakh exits in the last five years, and its combined headcount grew from 1 lakh to 1.8 lakh. With such high exits and an aggressive scale of replacement hiring, the alumni pool is a rich source of trained talent. Alumni hiring is not a new trend, however it has lacked the teeth it needed as most enterprises preferred unknown angels over known devils. A Harvard Business Review report quoted a study by human resources management services company UKG, which examined 3 million employee records from 2019 to 2022 and found that 28 per cent of “new hires” were boomerang hires who had resigned within the last 36 months. Another survey by HR consulting firm Robert Half in May 2024 found 48 per cent of people would consider returning to a previous company — up 8 per cent from 2023. The annual study of corporate alumni programmes by the University of British Columbia’s Sauder School of Business shows a boomerang hiring of 8 per cent among the companies surveyed. The study says 98 per cent of the organisations surveyed had at least one full-time equivalent (FTE) employee managing the alumni programme in 2024, 49 per cent had a team of two or more, and 60 per cent had an annual budget of at least $100,000. How many FTEs or dollars are allocated in your organisation for alumni programmes? Did you know that EA, the Enterprise Alumni platform, rates the top ten enterprise alumni networks based on rehiring percentage, number of new business opportunities generated, and mentorship and collaborative programmes or learning opportunities offered? It also rates how engaged the alumni community is. The last published list ranked Blackrock, PwC, McKinsey, EY, Marks and Spencer, and LinkedIn among the top ten. Back home, we know the Flipkart alumni have taken it to newer heights. There have been 44 startups from Flipkart alumni, and six of these have turned into unicorns with a combined valuation of $25 billion. Eight of them are backed by Flipkart founder Binny Bansal. As much as enterprises need a strategy to engage with their alumni, employees need to upskill on ‘when and how’ to resign! After all, we know it takes two to tango!

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. (Bloomberg) -- BlackRock Inc.’s Larry Fink was among headliners at Saudi Arabia’s annual Davos-style investment confab in October. Days later, he popped up on a social media post from Abu Dhabi’s $1.5 trillion man, Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan. Most Read from Bloomberg The Leaf Blowers Will Not Go Quietly Arizona Elections Signal Robust Immigration Enforcement Under Trump Scoring an Architectural Breakthrough in Denver’s RiNo District Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races Highlight Views on Abortion, Immigration The $11.5 trillion asset manager Fink runs recently received approval to set up its regional headquarters in Riyadh. It’s also teaming up with the Abu Dhabi royal on one of the largest efforts to date to bankroll the build-out of data warehouses and energy infrastructure. The biggest firms on Wall Street operate across geographies and top executives often fly to multiple countries while visiting a region. But Riyadh and Abu Dhabi, which are competing to be the Middle East’s main business hub, offer unique opportunities: The cities control over $1 trillion in sovereign wealth each, making them among the biggest pools of capital in the world. Sheikh Tahnoon — one of Abu Dhabi’s two deputy rulers, the United Arab Emirates’ national security adviser and brother to its president — had conversations with many executives who also spoke at the FII, according to posts on the royal’s X profile. That list included Morgan Stanley Chief Executive Officer Ted Pick, Blackstone Inc.’s Steve Schwarzman and Ruth Porat of Alphabet Inc., which is partnering with Saudi Arabia on an artificial intelligence hub. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. CEO David Solomon also dropped by in Abu Dhabi shortly after his firm announced its new Riyadh office, according to a person familiar with the matter. The two cities have rolled out a series of initiatives in their quest for greater global relevance. Riyadh is asking international firms to boost their local presence, or risk losing business. That’s prompted the likes of General Atlantic and Goldman to beef up their operations in the kingdom. Some others have been reluctant about making Riyadh their main hub because their employees prefer the lifestyle in the UAE. To further sweeten the deal, Abu Dhabi has also rolled out a series of perks, including a lifestyle-support program for incoming financiers. But many firms looking to raise cash or plug into dealmaking driven by ambitious diversification programs are trying to keep a foot in both camps. BlackRock, for instance, said its new Riyadh base will help the firm expand operations across the Middle East and not just in the kingdom. Goldman continues to have a significant presence in both Dubai and Abu Dhabi, and Barclays Plc, which is considering re-entering Saudi Arabia after a decade, said it intends to grow its team in the UAE as well. Meanwhile, investment bank Lazard Inc., which held sale talks with Abu Dhabi fund ADQ last year, is making a big push in Saudi Arabia, Bloomberg News has reported. While both cities have embarked on similar drives to lure the world’s biggest firms, the past couple of years have also brought into sharp relief shifting priorities for officials in Riyadh and Abu Dhabi, and the kinds of partnerships they’re seeking. For instance, Saudi Arabia, with its large and relatively young population, is prioritizing projects aimed at developing its infrastructure, which significantly lags the UAE. But with finances constrained as a result of weak oil prices, it needs to bring in more foreign capital - hence the desire to get the world’s biggest infrastructure fund managers into the country. Case in point: Brookfield Asset Management Ltd.’s new $2 billion Middle East vehicle. “People used to come to us and ask for money,” Yasir Al Rumayyan, the governor of the kingdom’s nearly $1 trillion Public Investment Fund, said on a panel at the FII last month. “We are now seeing a shift from people wanting to take our money to people wanting to co-invest.” Saudi Arabia is also becoming a regional opportunity for investment banks. The kingdom is in the midst of a vast privatization program to raise cash to fund investment plans, and that’s transformed Riyadh into a hotspot for initial public offerings. For Abu Dhabi, with energy riches outweighing the ability of the local economy to digest and which already boasts some of the best infrastructure in the region, the focus is using those assets to prepare for the post-oil economy. Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, the emirate’s $1 trillion wealth fund continues to invest predominantly outside the country. At the same time, the city has drawn some of the world’s biggest hedge funds. That’s prompted officials to start expanding the financial hub’s jurisdiction to a neighboring island, in a move that will give it 10 times as much space. Months after billionaire Alan Howard said Abu Dhabi could become a global financial center, Bloomberg News reported the hedge fund he set up manages more money from the emirate than anywhere else. Get the Mideast Money newsletter, a weekly look at the intersection of wealth and power in the region. But here too, there’s a balancing act. Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio, the face of Abu Dhabi’s push to draw hedge fund luminaries, was in Riyadh for FII. He was spotted in traditional Arab garb ahead of the event and later, on a panel, explained the reasons behind his ties to the region. The billionaire was effusive in his praise of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. “I think his Royal Highness is a great leader,” he said. “He’s almost like a Deng Xiaoping of China, in a sense, or a Lee Kuan Yew (of Singapore).” --With assistance from Silla Brush, Mark Bergen, Laura Gardner Cuesta, Ben Scent and Siddharth Philip.

SINGAPORE – Bitcoin rallied past US$81,000 for the first time, boosted by President-elect Donald Trump’s embrace of digital assets and the prospect of a Congress featuring pro-crypto lawmakers. Trump was declared the winner in Arizona in recent polls, marking a clean sweep of the seven US battleground states. His decisive victory in the presidential election has prompted celebratory chest-thumping from the digital asset industry, which spent more than US$100 million (S$132.7 million) backing a range of crypto-friendly candidates. The token climbed as much as 6.1 per cent on Nov 10. It hit an unprecedented US$81,497 early in Asia trading on Nov 11 and was changing hands at US$81,244 as at 4.48pm in Singapore. Bullish sentiment lifted smaller coins too, including a surge in Dogecoin, a meme-crowd favourite promoted by Trump supporter Elon Musk. “With the dust from Trump’s victory still settling down, it was only a matter of time before a run-up of some sort occurred, given the perception of Trump being pro-crypto, and that’s what we’re seeing now,” said Mr Le Shi, Hong Kong managing director at market-making firm Auros. Trump vowed on the campaign trail to put the US at the centre of the digital asset industry, including creating a strategic Bitcoin stockpile and appointing regulators enamoured with digital assets. Jubilant traders, for the moment, are paying little heed to questions such as the speed of likely implementation or whether a strategic stockpile is a realistic possibility. His broader agenda of stoking domestic economic growth, tax cuts and reducing red tape has fuelled a buying spree across stocks, credit and crypto. The S&P 500 stock index last week hit its 50th record in 2024. Bitcoin has added about 92 per cent so far in 2024, helped by robust demand for dedicated US exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. The rise in the largest digital token, which scaled fresh records after the US vote, exceeds the returns from investments such as stocks and gold. The ETFs, powered by BlackRock’s US$35 billion iShares Bitcoin Trust, posted a record daily net inflow of almost US$1.4 billion on Nov 7, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Title: Can a company force me to sell my shares?
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/your-money/2024/11/10/can-a-company-force-me-to-sell-my-shares/
Time Published: 2024-11-10T12:37:53Z

My 86-year-old father holds 10,000 shares in Balmoral International Land. As mentioned in your paper last month, the directors are seeking an extraordinary general meeting (EGM) to implement a forced redemption of his shares and force a significant discount on him so he does not believe the offer is a good faith offer. He believes the redemption is not in the interests of the company but is in the interests of the directors and hence he believes they cannot legally do this. He is a small investor as a hobby and does not know how he can raise his concerns. Can you offer him some help on where he might be able to get advice on this matter? Mr B.G. * The McCann family and what was originally Fyffes have always had a very close relationship. Charles McCann, grandfather of Balmoral chairman Carl McCann, first opened a grocery shop in Dundalk in 1902, becoming the first Irish agent for what was then a small London-based importer of bananas, Fyffes. The business evolved to eventually list in Dublin, initially as FII plc in 1981 and then, from 1990, as Fyffes. After what was, at times, a rollercoaster ride for the family and shareholders, Fyffes split the business up in the back end of the Celtic Tiger. The group’s property interests were spun out as Blackrock International Land in 2006, changing the name in 2010 to Balmoral International Land. The McCanns had a 40 per cent interest in this business from the start so they were always likely to have a strong say in proceedings, not least as many of the rest of the shareholders were very small in scale. A few months after the Blackrock deal, Fyffes spun out its general fresh produce supply business as Total Produce, with the McCanns again holding a double-digit stake in the new company alongside existing Fyffes shareholders. The tropical fresh produce business remains as Fyffes as it was eventually sold to Japanese giant Sumitomo in 2016. Although all three were initially listed businesses with investments held by all former Fyffes shareholders, Balmoral delisted in 2011 after its share price slumped following the property crash in Ireland. In line with recent moves by AIB and PTSB, the company has a shareholder register featuring a few large shareholders and a raft of small stakeholders. According to the circular sent to shareholders in advance of this month’s planned extraordinary general meeting (EGM), of the company’s 5,000 or so shareholders, almost 4,500 hold 500 or fewer shares in the business. To put that in context, that means each of those 4,500 investors has a stake amounting to less than 0.007 per cent of the business. Balmoral says it is receiving an increasing number of requests from shareholders looking for an exit from the investment. Given that many of the original Fyffes plc investors would now be fairly old and others are now holding shares they may have inherited but which they have no real interest in, that certainly sounds plausible. As a delisted business, there was much less liquidity in the shares which trade on the “grey” or unofficial market. There is also the reality that many very small shareholders probably do not have stockbroking accounts and the broker cost of selling the shares would more than wipe out any face value return on the transaction. Balmoral also makes the obvious point that running a small delisted public company with a large shareholder base imposes a burden in terms of cost and administration for the business that takes away from its focus on the core business. The current move to buy out smaller shareholders is not the first. The company announced a Shareholder Redemption and Liquidity Programme last year when it first moved back into a cash positive position after many years, giving it the financial muscle for such a move. Last year, the company said it would spend an initial €2 million to buy back shares – focusing on investors with fewer than 50,000 shares. In an exercise that was purely optional, it agreed to pay seven cent a share. That was higher than the 5.5 cent at which the stock had traded in advance of the offer but sharply below the net asset value of the company’s portfolio which was reported to be 17.93 cent per share, according to its annual report which was published in advance of the buyback. In the event, the company spent €2.56 million buying back 36.6 million shares from 1,344 shareholders – just under 5 per cent of the stock. That exercise brought the McCann family shareholding above 60 per cent. It also implemented a one for 100 consolidation which meant that for every 100 shares you held previously, you now hold just one. Just over one year on, the company’s cash pot has grown again and, it says, it continues to head from shareholders looking to “unlock the value” of their shares. This is in the context where there has been little or no trading in the shares since the July 2023 buyback. So the company is going again, only this time things are different. The big difference is that, now, for many shareholders, the offer is mandatory. Anyone with fewer than 25,000 ordinary shares in the business will have their shares acquired at a price of ¤10.50 a share regardless of whether they want to sell or not. Those who have more than 25,000 shares will also have their holdings acquired as a default unless they opt out of that process. The issue, again, is the price. The €10.50 a share is more than double the price at which Balmoral shares last traded post-consolidation in the “grey market” last November. Since then, stockbrokers have stopped any dealing in the paper-based shares. However, the price equates to just over half of the €18.72 net asset value per share of the company’s portfolio as of the end of June. That’s a big deal. Small shareholders might reasonably expect that in a takeover situation, they would get a premium to its net asset value, or at the very least, parity. And it is effectively a takeover. The large shareholders – led by the McCanns – are ousting smaller fellow shareholders in a company that is finally cash generating as they take it private. And it is a done deal, as holders of over 80 per cent of all shares – including the McCanns – have said they will back the move at the EGM on Thursday week, November 21st in a move that inevitably gives them an even bigger stake in the company. Those eligible for opting out must request a form to do so before 11am on Tuesday next, November 19th, and must return it completed and with any required supporting documents by 6pm on November 28th. I am not sure whether the 10,000 shares that you mention your father has is his holding pre-consolidation or post-consolidation but either way, they will be acquired compulsorily. Is there anything he can do to hold on to the shares? Shareholders do have rights in Ireland but they are limited and the bigger question, in practical terms, is whether it is worth your father – or someone on his behalf – getting involved in the battle. Under the offer price, he will get €105,000 for his shares – assuming the 10,000 shares is a post-consolidation figure. If he were able to hold out for at least 100 per cent of the net asset value, as reported in June, he would receive a total of €187,200. Clearly €82,200 is not to be sneezed at, but in terms of the potential costs involved in trying to block the compulsory purchase of his shares, it would not go very far. And he needs to remember that while shareholders have rights, so do companies in how they manage their affairs. The two ways in which shareholders exercise their rights are by voting at or forcing general meetings of shareholders, and by recourse to law arguing that their rights are being oppressed. Their precise rights in a particular business will be determined by law and by the company’s memorandum and articles of association, or constitution. As a broad rule, a company is obliged to act in the interest of the company as a whole, and not in the interests of a group of shareholders even where those shareholders may be in a majority. All shareholders, including minorities, have property rights. However, given that over 80 per cent of shareholders are backing this motion, I see no way in which your father can force a change of heart at any meeting of shareholders, even if he could find sufficient dissenters to force a special meeting or a motion to this meeting – and time is certainly against him in marshalling any such action anyway. As for the legal route, it must be shown that the act or measure complained of has as its primary motive the advancement of the interests of the majority shareholders as opposed to the interests of the company as a whole – oppression of a group of shareholders and/or disregard of their property rights. The mere fact of the offer price compared with the paper net asset value, and the compulsory nature of the buyout are not in themselves proof of that. Nor is the outcome where the McCanns may hold 80 per cent of the private company. Given the history of the company, the illiquidity of the paper-based shares, the uncertainties surrounding the commercial property market and the unlikelihood of any return to a listed market, at least in the medium term, the challenge facing your father is very significant, quite likely insurmountable. And the financial cost would be very significant. Does it look like the major shareholders and directors are playing fast and loose with the interests of small shareholders? Yes. Can you stop them? In all likelihood, no. Stock investment is a risky game at the best of times, particularly investing in individual stocks rather than exchange traded funds or other pooled investments. Investing in a company exposed entirely to the property market is riskier still. Sometimes it is better simply to cut your losses and move on. I suspect that is his best option here. Any loss that the €105,000 crystallises can be offset against profits he makes on the future sale of other assets he hopefully makes this year or into the future. Any outstanding capital losses still in place when he dies will, as with any tax-liable capital gains, die with him. * This article was edited on Monday, November 11th, 2024 Please send your queries to Dominic Coyle, Q&A, The Irish Times, 24-28 Tara Street Dublin 2, or by email to dominic.coyle@irishtimes.com with a contact phone number.

[+] soars following Donald Trump's election victory. "Excess government spending is driving America into bankruptcy," Musk posted to X, the social media platform he bought and rebranded from Twitter, adding: "This debt growth is unsustainable." Musk was replying to bitcoin-backing Kentucky senator Rand Paul, who called the "status quo of $2 trillion annual deficits unsustainable." Paul made headlines in 2015 when he began accepting bitcoin campaign donations to support his Republican White House bid—with Donald Trump and many other 2024 candidates following suit—and in 2021 said in an interview he believed crypto could replace the U.S. dollar due to a lack of confidence in the currency and increased government surveillance. U.S. national debt has skyrocketed in recent years, crossing the $34 trillion mark at the beginning of 2024, largely due to Covid and lockdown stimulus measures that sent inflation spiraling out of control and forced the Federal Reserve to hike interest rates at a historical clip. Earlier this year, Trump floated the idea he could use bitcoin to "pay off our $35 trillion—hand them a little crypto check, right? We'll hand them a little bitcoin and wipe out our $35 trillion," he said. In July, Trump promised to create a "strategic national bitcoin reserve" and predicted bitcoin could eclipse gold's $16 trillion market capitalization during an appearance at the Bitcoin 2024 conference.

Musk's campaign against excessive U.S. spending has resulted in calls for the creation of the Doge Department Of Government Efficiency, which Musk has said he believes could strip $2 trillion from U.S. spending. The Doge department is a nod to the shiba inu doge meme that's also linked to the dogecoin cryptocurrency, named by Elon Musk as his "favorite" cryptocurrency and accepted as payment by his Tesla car company. Doge's association with the dogecoin bitcoin rival has caused the dogecoin price to more than double over the last month, with billionaire Mark Cuban joking Musk could put dogecoin in the U.S. Treasury.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Undervalued Stocks to Buy Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Manulife Financial Corporation (NYSE:MFC) stands against the other best undervalued stocks. As per Evercore, the equity market rally is expected to further accelerate under the Donald Trump presidency. The S&P 500 is expected to touch 6,600 by June end. This growth in the index is expected to stem from Trump’s deregulatory agency, which should fuel corporate profits. Trump is expected to act fast to enact his policies. The investment firm went on to add that measures such as deregulation and corporate tax cuts are expected to fuel business activity and unlock significant rally in stocks. The bull market’s 2-year run stemmed from healthy growth from mega-cap technology stocks, and high valuations are expected to further rise. Evercore hinted at data demonstrating that the average bull market witnessed an increase of 152% over 50 months, while the current market saw a run-up of only 65% over the previous 25 months. After Donald Trump’s win, economists and market strategists have been assessing how his economic policies might affect the broader US economy and equity markets. While the initial reaction was positive, some experts opine that Trump’s plans might fuel inflation, which will hurt consumers hoping to get some respite from it. Trump’s tax plan revolves around extending the provisions in the TCJA. The provisions are yet to expire at 2025 end. These provisions consist of lowered tax brackets and expanded standard deduction. Trump’s campaign proposed lowering the corporate tax rate to 15% from the current rate of 21%. What will be the impact on the economy? Well, the economy might initially grow moderately under Trump’s plans. That being said, the impact might fade over time, mainly because of the effect of deporting millions of immigrants, as per Oxford Economics. As per the chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, the real GDP might grow 0.3 percentage points higher in 2026 as compared to the situation if existing policies continue. However, in 2028, the GDP growth might eventually fall to 0.6 percentage points lower in 2028 as compared to earlier projections as a result of deportations and increased tariffs. READ ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In. Consumers tend to rank inflation among their biggest economic concerns. Global economists and market strategists believe that Trump’s Presidency can reignite inflation worries. According to investing legend, Jim Rogers, Trump’s tariffs might increase domestic inflation. As a result, the US Fed will be forced to keep the interest rates high. He further added that higher tariffs on goods, commodities, and products will lead to increased global inflation. Moreover, Trump has plans to deport millions of immigrants. This can also fuel inflation as employers will experience labor crunch, resulting in higher wages. While there are some uncertainties regarding the potential impacts of Trump’s economic policies, market experts believe that investors can go long on stocks that remain undervalued despite the recent rally. To list the 10 Best Undervalued Stocks to Buy Right Now, we used a screener and sifted through several online rankings to extract the list of stocks trading at a forward P/E multiple of less than 15. Next, we selected the stocks which were popular among hedge funds. Finally, the stocks were ranked in the ascending order of their hedge fund sentiments, as of Q2 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Stocks chart Forward P/E Ratio as of 8 November: 11.00x Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 22 Manulife Financial Corporation (NYSE:MFC) offers financial products and services in the US, Canada, Asia, and internationally. Market analysts are quite optimistic about Manulife Financial Corporation (NYSE:MFC)’s EPS growth trajectory given the growth potential in Manulife’s Asia and Global Wealth and Asset Management (GWAM) segments. Manulife Financial Corporation (NYSE:MFC) continues to pursue strategic initiatives in a bid to enhance shareholder value and optimize its business portfolio. A critical development was the company’s progress in reducing its exposure to legacy risks and Alternative Long-Duration Assets (ALDA). Given Manulife Financial Corporation (NYSE:MFC)’s capital position, analysts believe that it is well-placed to pursue strategic growth opportunities, like acquisitions or investments in high-growth markets, mainly in Asia. Such investments are expected to drive long-term revenue growth and market share expansion, resulting in increased shareholder value. In Asia, Manulife Financial Corporation (NYSE:MFC) can capitalize on the region’s expanding middle class, higher life expectancy, and improved demand for insurance and wealth management products. Its established presence in key Asian markets places it well to capture a larger share of this growth potential. Manulife Financial Corporation (NYSE:MFC) has maintained its focus on pivoting to a business model with lower risk and higher ROE. Moreover, it continues to emphasize the quality and productivity of agents in Asia. The company has been expanding its customer reach with the help of strategic partnerships and new product offerings. In Global WAM, Manulife Financial Corporation (NYSE:MFC) completed the acquisition of CQS, which is a U.K.-based multi-sector alternative credit manager. Overall, MFC ranks 8th on our list of the 10 best undervalued stocks to buy right now. While we acknowledge the potential of MFC as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than MFC but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Is Starbucks Corporation (SBUX) The Best Stock Under $100 To Invest In?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Stocks Under $100 To Invest In. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) stands against the other best stocks under $100. Wall Street experts believe that mid-cap stocks might be well-placed for a strong run-up. As per Ryan Detrick (Chief Market Strategist at Carson Group), historically, midcaps outperform once the US Fed actually initiates cutting rates. According to him, the small and mid-caps are expected to surge up to 20% over the upcoming 12 months, far exceeding the large-cap counterparts. Furthermore, Goldman Sachs believes that mid-caps outperform large- and small-cap stocks over the 12 months after the first rate cut. As market experts continue to expect a soft landing, the investors might look for other options apart from the biggest companies. As per the earnings sight report from FactSet dated 1st November, the S&P 500 continues to report mixed results. The Q3 remained strong for risk assets and safe havens, with the US markets delivering an all-time closing high to finish Q3 and bonds posting positive returns, as per JPMorgan Asset Management. Overall, the S&P 500 gaining for 4th straight quarter (making 18 new highs), and the US Treasuries and corporate bonds rallying with the decline in yields dominated much of the movements in Q3 2024. The asset management firm also added that gold saw its biggest gain since Q1 2016 (thanks to the expectations of faster rate cuts) and China’s stimulus supported equity market returns. What is expected for Q4 2024 now? JPM believes that positive expected earnings growth, cooling inflation, easing policies of central banks, and firm job creation should help create a strong backdrop for risk assets. Wall Street analysts believe that mid-caps might be in a position to see strong growth moving forward. READ ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In. As per BofA’s Jill Carey Hall, mid-caps can be considered as the “best hedge” for the near term. According to Hall, the mid-caps have experienced better recent guidance and revision trends and have also surpassed the small caps on average in the downturn scenarios. Mid-caps can also act as a hedge against fewer-than-expected rate cuts, considering that small caps are rate-sensitive. According to Goldman’s Jenny Ma, the start of the rate-cut cycle remains a potential source of incremental equity demand and a boost to broader investor risk sentiment. Moreover, over the short term, mid-cap performance as compared to other segments is expected to be dependent on the strength of economic growth data, along with the pace of the easing cycle. As per Wells Fargo, mid-cap growth stocks are technically oversold as of now. Despite this, these stocks have a significant scope to outperform. It also added that stability in their earnings, risk, liquidity, and balance sheet appear to be more attractive as compared to small caps. With these trends in mind, let’s take a look at the 10 Best Stocks Under $100 To Invest In. To list the 10 Best Stocks Under $100 To Invest In, we first used a screener to extract stocks trading under $100. Next, we narrowed our list by selecting the ones having high hedge fund holdings. Finally, the stocks were arranged in the ascending order of their hedge fund sentiments, as of Q2 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

Stock Price as of November 6: $96.08 Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 70 Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) operates as a roaster, marketer, and retailer of coffee. Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX)’s brand strength stems from its pricing power, attractive unit-level economics, and successful international replication. Wall Street remains optimistic about the leadership change. Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) brought in Brian Niccol as its new Chairman and CEO. Analysts opine that his experience in fueling operational efficiencies, improving marketing strategies, and fostering product innovation should be a perfect fit for the company’s current needs. Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) will continue to benefit from a healthy brand presence and customer loyalty throughout various generational cohorts. Its focus on improving throughput, enhancing digital marketing, and driving product innovation appears to be critical for maintaining and strengthening its competitive edge. Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) has been emphasizing product innovation as a critical driver of customer interest and sales growth. The company’s initiatives which are focused on streamlining operations, optimizing store formats, and leveraging technology for improved efficiency are expected to yield substantial benefits. Analysts at Morgan Stanley increased their price target on the shares of Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) from $98.00 to $115.00, giving it an “Overweight” rating on 16th October. ClearBridge Investments, an investment management company, released its Q3 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said: “Similarly, we took advantage of a business reset at Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) in the third quarter to initiate a position in the global coffee retailer. A confluence of factors, including degraded store-level operations and long consumer wait times, consumer fatigue with high prices and weakening engagement among occasional Starbucks customers has led to declining U.S. same-store sales growth. While the path ahead will likely require reinvestment back into the business, there are many merits to Starbucks’ business including its strong brand name and category leading market position. In response to recent challenges, Starbucks has appointed change-agent CEO Brian Niccol, who we know from the Strategy’s ownership of Chipotle Mexican Grill during its turnaround. Niccol has a successful track record of investing in product innovation and fixing execution issues, which we believe are the primary challenges facing Starbucks today. Starbucks represents the kind of successful playbook we have executed on historically – focusing on high-quality businesses and brands while being disciplined around the entry point into investments with attractive risk-reward opportunities.” Overall, SBUX ranks 6th on our list of the best stocks under $100 to invest in. While we acknowledge the potential of SBUX as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Title: Bitcoin on cusp of $80,000 for first time on optimism over Trump
URL: https://www.bangkokpost.com/business/investment/2899663/bitcoin-on-cusp-of-80-000-for-first-time-on-optimism-over-trump
Time Published: 2024-11-10T11:27:00Z

Bitcoin is closing in on $80,000 for the first time, boosted by President-elect Donald Trump’s embrace of digital assets and the prospect of a Congress featuring pro-crypto lawmakers. The cryptocurrency climbed as much as 4.3% to an unprecedented $79,771 on Sunday and remained near $79,000 as of 2.05pm in Singapore. Smaller tokens like Cardano and meme-crowd favourite Dogecoin also rallied. Trump vowed on the campaign trail to put the US at the centre of the digital-asset industry, including creating a strategic Bitcoin stockpile and appointing regulators enamoured with digital assets. He emerged from Tuesday’s election in a stronger position than expected — his Republican Party has control of the Senate and is on the verge of holding a narrow majority in the House. “With the dust from Trump’s victory still settling down, it was only a matter of time before a run-up of some sort occurred given the perception of Trump being pro-crypto, and that’s what we’re seeing now,” said Le Shi, Hong Kong managing director at market-making firm Auros. Bitcoin has added about 90% so far in 2024, helped by robust demand for dedicated US exchange-traded funds and interest-rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. The rise in the largest digital token, which scaled fresh records after the US vote, exceeds the returns from investments such as stocks and gold. The ETFs, powered by BlackRock Inc’s $35 billion iShares Bitcoin Trust, posted a record daily net inflow of almost $1.4 billion on Thursday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A day earlier, the iShares ETF’s trading volume jumped to an all-time peak — all signs of how Trump’s victory is reshaping crypto. Trump’s stance contrasts with a crackdown on digital assets under President Joe Biden. Securities & Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler repeatedly labelled the sector as rife with fraud and misconduct. The agency turned the screws on crypto following a 2022 market rout and a litany of collapses, notably the bankruptcy of Sam Bankman-Fried’s fraudulent FTX exchange. Digital-asset companies and executives spent heavily during the US election campaign to promote candidates viewed as favourable toward their interests. “Trump has promised supportive regulation, and the sweep of the House and the Senate makes the passage of crypto bills much more likely,” wrote Noelle Acheson, author of the Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter.

Title: Germany, Trump, and Walking the Trans-Atlantic Plank

The fallout from Project Ukraine is familiar to the average German. It’s now reaching the country’s political class where the disgraced ruling coalition heads for the exits after wrecking the country with their blind support for “trans-atlanticism” at the expense of most Germans. Don’t shed a tear for them as they’ll likely be rewarded handsomely for a job well done. They got the ball rolling with the energy/economic crisis, which now looks likely to usher in forces seeking to further empower the financial sector in Germany at the expense of the working class. One Government, Two Economies The so-called traffic light coalition of the Social Democrats (red), Free Democratic Party (yellow, and the Greens was always an odd grouping. United by their tickets on the Biden Administration-driven Project Ukraine bus, party pretenses like fiscal conservatism and minimal protections for the working class were tossed out the window on the road to Moscow. But the bus is now in a ditch, the Americans are halfway down the road and the Germans are stuck. As it became impossible to ignore the folly of the grand plan to use Ukraine to collapse Russia, the coalition began to unravel and fight among themselves after the German constitutional court slapped down an attempt to get around the country’s so-called debt brake in order to throw more money down the Ukraine pit. The government has been struggling for months to finalize a budget, and Chancellor Olaf Scholz finally threw in the towel when he fired Finance Minister Chrisitan Lindner over his renewed commitment to fiscal prudence after two years of lavishing gifts on Ukraine. Lindner’s FDP has taken on so much water that it’s currently sits below the five percent threshold to be included in the next Bundestag. The Greens, which are the most slavishly Atlanticist of the bunch, will likely pay the lowest electoral price. They might not have gotten their hands on all of Russia’s strategic minerals for the clean energy future, but Germany is on its way to becoming an agrarian society that uses less fossil fuels. Scholz, who has seen his party embarrassed in the recent European elections and a few German state votes, is hoping to hold a no-confidence vote on January 15 and then new elections in March with the hope that he could get a provisional budget through with some popular items that could attract voters back to his party. The outcry from the opposition and wider public over waiting until late Spring 2025 for a new government to be installed is now forcing Scholz to consider moving up his dates. A final brief obituary note on the worst post-WWII German government: It’s commonly assumed that the country’s vassalage explains its recent ineptness. While there’s certainly some truth to that, Berlin’s decision to go all in on the harebrained resource-grab plan makes a little more sense when looking under the hood. Germany’s economy had been sputtering for some time. There’s only so long you can rely on wage suppression and low investment. Grabbing Russian (and Ukrainian) resources could have had an immense payoff even if the Americans took the lion’s share, and there are two key points about the risk-reward calculation of the German elite: First, despite the crisis for the industrial economy of the past few years, the wealthiest Germans, the asset-owning class, is doing quite well. Unsurprisingly wealthier Germans were always the biggest backers of Project Ukraine because they did not face the consequences and this is reflected in the country’s politics and media. Second, crisis creates opportunity. As Michael Hudson summarized back in 2022: The economy is to be Thatcherized – all by riding the crest of the American anti-Russian sanctions and claiming that this creates a crisis requiring dismantling of public infrastructure and its privatization and financialization. He was right, and that trend looks set to accelerate. The Trump ‘Crisis’ Let’s first step back and take in the wreckage. I’ve been pounding this drum for a while here at NC, but going hand in hand with war against Russia is a war at home on the German working class. The German social partnership model — which rests on the lie that the interests of capital and labor can peacefully coexist — is getting the final nail in the coffin after years of feckless leadership whose main goal was putting a happy face on wage and benefit cuts. (This is probably long overdue and possibly one positive outcome of the events of the last few years.) Meanwhile, the energy outlook remains dire. The industrial economy is dying. A mixture of public housing being sold off to investors, less building, millions of immigrants, and rent freeze loopholes has the country in a severe housing crisis. Real wages are well below what they were in 2020 despite ticking upwards recently. German companies are increasingly outsourcing industrial production as a fix to Berlin’s self-imposed decline in competitiveness Subservience to the US has been cemented in Berlin, as well as Brussels. Germany and the EU are supposedly facing a myriad of crises. A closer look reveals them all to be self-inflicted or imaginary, however. Ukraine/Russia, economic/competitiveness (which is aided by austerity), and now comes Trump, which I fail to see as anything new for Berlin. Here was the German leadership class a few weeks ago throwing a party for Biden despite his role in bringing the country to its knees: US President Joe Biden has been awarded Germany’s highest honor, the Grand Cross of the Order of Merit at a ceremony in Berlin, on his farewell trip to Europe. pic.twitter.com/pNZOyos0e7 — DW Politics (@dw_politics) October 18, 2024 And they’re now up in arms about Trump potentially shoving the knife in a little deeper? Aside from upstarts like the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party on the right and the Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance (BSW) on the left, these “crises” do not lead to a call to rethink policy towards Russia or China, with which the EU is pursuing a trade war while being wholly unprepared as many products they rely on from China like certain drugs, chemicals and materials have no substitutes. Nor do they bring questioning of the sanctity of the transatlantic relationship despite the “de-risking” strategy with China and Russia making Europe more reliant on Washington: Europe now relies on the US for security, the US for (fossil) energy and the US for demand … to rephrase an old trope about Germany https://t.co/0lxEdquQCn pic.twitter.com/m2aaIiYQn5 — Brad Setser (@Brad_Setser) October 18, 2024 In other words Germany has effectively boxed itself in so that must be prepared to do whatever it takes to avoid those tariffs Trump is proposing on German exports. How about all the endless talk about Europe (primarily Germany) shouldering more of the heavy load of the “rules-based international order”? Lo and behold, we have the plutocrat-funded think tanks ready with a solution to this crisis of Trump: Henning Hoff [from the German Council on Foreign Relations] believes that it is now important for the German government to “make up for its failures.” “A much stronger signal is needed to show that the Europeans, especially the Germans, are truly prepared to shoulder a greater burden of their defense. If we continue to fumble along and argue — we have the dedicated funds (for the Bundeswehr), so the defense budget need only increase minimally — then we won’t be able to impress anyone in Washington, not now and certainly not under Trump.” What does that mean in practice? Unfortunately for Germany and the EU, that will almost certainly include pressure from the US to prop up whatever is left of Ukraine and probably making sure its bondholders are made whole. While all the reports coming out about Trump’s plans should be taken with a grain of salt due to those wily neocons and their allies in the media potentially trying to box him in, the Wall Street Journal recently reported that Trump’s plan to “freeze” the war includes European and British troops enforcing a buffer zone between the two sides. “We are not sending American men and women to uphold peace in Ukraine. And we are not paying for it. Get the Poles, Germans, British and French to do it,” one Trump staffer reportedly said. Either way, the EU is also to continue to serve as a waiting house for NATO so it must find spare change to bring Armenia, Moldova, Georgia, and who knows, Kazakhstan(?) on board as well. How to pay for all the color revolution efforts, bribes, military hardware, state aid, and everything else required by the EU’s now-openly subservient role to US imperial ambitions? The think tanks and hacks like French President Emmanuel Macron, European Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen, and economist for hire and sometimes unelected prime minister Mario Draghi say it’s common EU debt. (In theory, there could be benefits to common debt, especially for countries like Italy which face higher borrowing costs, but going down that road to pay for the US empire ain’t it.) Berlin has long been opposed, but now here comes the big bad orange man saying what many of the European elite have been saying — yet failing to act on. Europe must get serious about defense or at least pony up to keep the Americans on board. Who’s riding in to save the day for Germany? None other than [checks notes] former BlackRock board member Friedrich Merz. That’s the same BlackRock all tied up into Project Ukraine. It took $17 billion in losses on Russia exposure after the war began and has been at Zelensky’s side ever since. Step on up Herr Merz! Merz is the odds-on favorite to lead the country as his increasingly rightwing Christian Democratic Union has a comfortable lead in the polls. Aside from being a diehard neoliberal, Merz is also a trusted Atlanticist. Merz tries to appear tougher on Russia than the Scholz coalition. He’s now talking up how he will give Taurus missiles to Ukraine. That appears increasingly unlikely and wouldn’t make a difference anyways aside from potentially bringing Germany into the line of fire. It does signal he has no intention to pursue a thaw in the New Cold War or autonomy from the US, however. Merz is a supporter of the planned stationing of US medium range missiles in Germany, which will provide another impediment to repairing ties with Russia. Here’s Merz is in a conversation at Atlantic-Brucke, which succinctly sums up how a Merz government would value the transatlantic relationship and deal with Trump’s likely demands: We are in the midst of a cultural fight about the future of our liberal order. He concludes that it is really uncertain whether we will win. But there is something that makes me optimistic: when I travel to the United States, my experience is that in these complicated times, more Americans than ever before are willing to defend what we achieved over the last seven decades. Let’s preserve our freedom and our liberty… When Jean-Claude Juncker travelled to Washington, D.C. in July of 2018 and had a debate with President Trump in the Oval Office, he gave a very clear statement about trade. He could only convince the President not to implement more tariffs on European goods because he had a letter signed by 28 European heads of state backing his point. Europe has to be clearer and we have to be united. That brings me to another point: The Germans have to take on more leadership within the European Union. What could that look like for Germans? Merz wants to cut social spending, yet reform the debt brake to allow for more spending at the same time. That should tell us all we need to know. As for common EU debt, Merz has been very careful with his words. In September, Draghi unveiled his much-discussed report calling for massive amounts of spending in order for things like AI investment, other “disruptive” tech, and of course, to paper over the bloc’s ongoing energy crisis. Here was Merz on that report: “I want to say this very clearly, now and in the future, I will do everything I can to prevent this European Union from spiraling into debt.” Maybe I’m parsing his words too carefully, but it’d be easy to make the argument, as Draghi does, that the investments would help pay for themselves. And as the German economy continues to tank, it could be easier to argue that a Draghi-style plan is the answer. While Merz and the CDU look like the safe bet to lead the next German government, the biggest question is who will be their coalition partner(s). If the transatlantic asset-owning class faces any potential hurdles, it’s to be found in the AfD and BSW, but will Merz be able to keep them out of any coalition? As of now, polling indicates there would be only five parties in the Bundestag, and the CDU would be forced to side with its fellow Atlanticists, the SPD and the hated Greens, or forget the firewall against the AfD. The least likely is that Sahra Wagenknecht’s party would be included in any coalition due to her party’s opposition to the ongoing economic war against Russia and strong focus on working class issues. While the AfD and CDU increasingly see eye to eye on the issues like immigration that get the former labeled the second coming of the Nazis by media in and out of Germany, the problem is that the AfD is opposed to Atlanticism. It should be noted however that the AfD firewall in the European Parliament recently broke down. Here’s Politico: The latest example of the EPP’s flirtation with the far right, according to my colleagues Gregorio Sorgi and Max Griera, came at a vote on the EU’s 2025 budget Wednesday. The EPP, including Weber himself, tore up a deal it had made with its traditional centrist allies and backed extreme-right amendments, proposed by the Alternative for Germany (AfD), calling for EU money to be spent on border infrastructure and so-called return hubs for deporting migrants. The AfD celebrated “demolishing” Parliament’s anti-far-right firewall. *** At first glance Biden’s visit to Germany a few weeks ago to be bestowed with honors seemed to be another in a long line of gleeful celebrations of failure from our rules-based order. Take another glance and one can come to a different conclusion. Despite the economic wreckage across Germany and a body count in the millions across Ukraine and Middle East, these leaders from the Western ancien regime were truly there to toast their successes. All the blueprints provided by the plutocrat-funded think tanks on both sides of the Atlantic are coming to pass. A more financialized Germany will shoulder a heavier load of the empire. Short term thinking? Sure, but for now the country is successfully walled off from the East and prepped to be set upon by the vultures in the West. IMO, it would be infinitely more likely a coalition between CDU-Greens or CDU-SPD or the three of them than a coalition between CDU-AfD. Just look how the elites talk about far right, Trump, Orban etc. Always fully Atlanticist coalitions, that is the PMC rule. Merz has served as counsellor or board member at BlackRock and at MayerBrown in mergers ans acquisitions. Chair at that atlanticist think tank mentioned in the article (Atlantic Brucke). He must be the quintessential PMC-type German politician no wonder he despises his fellow citizens and almost certainly has a neoliberal, neoconservative, atlanticist dream at odds with German realities. So, expect the worst from him. I would not be so sure. In Austria, the ÖVP was once staunchly refusing to govern in a coalition with the FPÖ — decried as extreme right, putinist, with demonstrable links to the nazi past, led by populist politicians — until it did. I therefore do not judge an alliance between the AfD and the CDU-CSU to have such low odds. Thank you vao. Don’t you think Germany is too big or influential for those niceties? Not sure if Austria serves as a model here. I do not see Merz as likely to go with AfD though it might be the wise way to destroy AfD ‘s future. Yet, it might look bad on EU affairs. On this you are better informed of course. My guess is that the the CDU-CSU will first try to go with the SPD. After all, 1) these two parties know each other, since they have been in coalitions several times in the past (both at the level of Bund and Land); 2) the SPD is weakened but wants to keep governing, and thus the CDU-CSU has very good chances to be a dominating senior partner; 3) while nobody wants to ally with AfD and even less with BSW, the Greens are felt to be (a) a pain in the neck and (b) a discredited partner. Contra this, the SPD might not want to renew the not so good experience of the coalition with the CDU-CSU under Merkel. Your suggestion of an alliance where the CDU-CSU would embrace and choke the AfD is seductive, and it is probably in the minds of some of the CDU-CSU leaders. The issue I see is that none of these seem to me to have the calibre to succeed in such an endeavour. Let us face it: the current crop of German (and, in general, European) politicians is very mediocre, even at pure party politics. And yes, Austria is quite peculiar. But alliances of traditional conservatives with formerly unsavoury right-wing parties have taken place all over Europe (Italy, Netherlands, Sweden), including in a German-speaking country (Austria). There is no reason to assume Germany will constitute an exception. No expertise in German politics here, but as an example of ’embracing and choking’ of the AfD by CDU-CSU one can look to Mitterrand in early 1980s France. The Communist party there never really recovered. Complex reasons, for sure, but Mitterrand, in that period, was as crafty a politico as one could find anywhere. He represented an entirely different political generation. Nothing to do with what you find nowadays. Mitterand changed the voting system back and forth to suit his desired outcomes. Cannot do that in Germany plus German parties Fragment but are geographically coherent Eugyppius is a very keen observer of what’s afoot in Deutschland, and just posted a very good article along the same lines as this one, but I think has a clearer accounting of how the collapse of the traffic light coalition, the intermediate governance by CDU and Merz, the results of the snap elections, (what shakes out from that), who gains/who doesn’t, and about what sort of new coalition can be formed to make up a new govt. The Eugyppius contention is that Germany and its political dysfunction is so perversely Fubar that there’s no real alternative to some sort of reemergence of SPD++. None will tolerate an AfD role, and the remaining options among parties that survive the 5% cut off for Bundestag seats are not moving Germany forward; more of the same, but perhaps a tad more stupid and in thrall to the hegemon. https://open.substack.com/pub/eugyppius/p/how-the-german-government-collapsed?r=184ox5&utm_medium=ios SPD has been in government for 15 past 20 years. Scholz was Merkel‘s deputy. Currently Germany has an unelected Defence Minister and an unelected Finance Minister Thanks. Quickly some links: German economist Heiner Flassbeck whose expertise as an economist I can´t judge is, I believe, in favour of Trump´s alleged tariffs plan which Richard Wolff on the other hand on ConsortiumNews wholeheartedly condemned and doesn´t believe in anyway because it would ruin US companies. For that Richard Wolff: TC: 11:40 – 34:15 https://consortiumnews.com/2024/11/06/watch-cn-live-us-election-whats-next/ Flassbeck here: https://overton-magazin.de/hintergrund/wirtschaft/lindner-und-merz-gehen-bei-trump-in-lehre/ Engl. version: “Lindner and Merz learn from Trump” https://archive.is/taw0E Flassbeck before the election in a German interview didn´t really buy into the de-industrialisation drama that much. He however is extremely critical of the entirety of German bureaucrats running the Ministry for Commerce and Finance who he sees as incompetent. German only audio-Interview with Heiner Flassbeck https://overton-magazin.de/dialog/im-gespraech/heiner-flassbeck-friedrich-merz-bestand-schon-vor-25-jahren-nur-aus-sprechblasen/ Flassbeck however DOES warn of a historic recession. e.g. here: German https://www.telepolis.de/features/Hallo-aufwachen-Es-ist-Rezession-9818341.html Engl. “Hello, wake up! It’s recession!” I have been observing the German economy for almost 50 years. It has never been this bad: recession, deindustrialization and job cuts. What can we do? A column. https://archive.is/SIy0I I am not suggesting this is academic-level content but for starters. The German edition of JACOBIN had a piece about the demise of German car-manufacturers which however didn´t fully keep the promise of it´s title (as I found as layman). What it did contain were hyperlinks for a few major studies on the future of German car-manufacturing scattered across that text. “The German car industry can no longer be saved” VW is facing massive job cuts. Instead of closing factories, VW and others need to be made future-proof, is the demand from the left. But it has long been clear that others can make electric cars better. https://www.jacobin.de/artikel/autoindustrie-elektro-auto-e-mobilitaet-vw-werkschliessung Engl. version: (if it won´t work you have to put it into google-translate yourself, archive.is doesn´t preserve the translated version.) https://www-jacobin-de.translate.goog/artikel/autoindustrie-elektro-auto-e-mobilitaet-vw-werkschliessung?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=de&_x_tr_pto=wapp&_x_tr_hist=true Written by a Timo Daum, non-fiction author and guest of the research group “Digital Mobility and Social Differentiation” at the Berlin Social Science Center (WZB). p.s. gazing at those 6,7% for BSW in above poll makes me think of possibly intentionally faulty polls in the US. Thank you. On past form, Flassbeck is good. He’s traditional SPD, not neoliberal. Unfortunately the article is spot on. What could throw a spanner into the works of the Atlantacists is the growing disquiet of the German masses as well as the continuing advance of Russia in Ukraine. You need the mass media to rule but the mass media are on an incredible downward spin here in Germany. They told Germans that the Covid vaccines were adverse effects free, that Russia would lose the war, that Nordstream was blown up by Russia (that was so improbable that even the most gullible started to doubt and now it´s Ukraine) and finally that Harris was guaranteed to win. The worst part is that our ruling classes got high on their own supply. All trust is breaking down and it will be interesting to see how they can go on. My guess is that next German government will turn very unpopular. As fast as Starmer’s in the UK or faster. If this has noticeable political consequences, such as a far-right turn in both the UK and Germany is yet to be seen. The reality is that, so far, the Left has turned insignificant. > the Left has turned insignificant. Ain’t that the truth. Fully agree with what you say and the natives will get restless. When you said ‘All trust is breaking down and it will be interesting to see how they can go on.’ isn’t that what happened in the US Presidential elections? Who had trust in the Biden regime anymore by election day? Read a joke today – Zelensky was complaining to Germany how the Russians were destroying their energy infrastructure whereupon Germany replied that that is what their Greens were doing to their own energy infrastructure. It’s funny because it’s true. Also agree with Rev Kev and ignacio. We’re only five days into the shocker of Trump 2. Metaphors can run away with you, but I think mainstream German pols are desperately trying to rework their old positions to stem the disintegration of an policy/electoral ice field that is in the process of thawing. Conor and AG have already done excellent work here, but I wish we could get a better sense of how Die Linke, BSW, and left formations in the SPD are gauging their options over the next couple of months. Except it wasn’t the Greens that bombed NordStream. It wasn’t even the Greens that decided to phase out German nuclear power, that was Merkel. The Greens seemed to have been on board with the Nord Stream bombing, however. They said NOTHING (that I know of). Thank you, Tom. I worked for Germany’s biggest bank from 2016 – 21 and currently work for a Dutch bank with operations all over Germany, since 2022, and agree with and observe your comments. My colleagues see their own situations and that of clients and are alarmed. Dear Colonel Smithers. I wonder how can you stay healthy in that environment. My wife, (risk assessment in Mutual fund management) got absolutely fed up in theirs. Imagine with all those bullshit mergers after the big financial crisis. She is now retired but yesterday met a few of her former colleagues (+20years sharing workplace). One of them said that he still feels leftist. Yet, minutes after saying that, he said that “why on earth should all the Spanish pay for the catastrophe in Valencia”. I didn’t know that everyone facing up to their responsibilities was the new leftist mantra. Thank you, Ignacio. I’m fed up and want out of the City and thinking of going to Mauritius as my parents wish to return for good. The pair are 80 this month. The oceanic winds there cannot do any harm. On the contrary. Good luck for all. Thank you, Ignacio. I have noticed a shift this year. Some children of immigrants, like me, or their children are making plans to leave. It’s not just the UK’s economic prospects, but, where I live in Buckinghamshire, and York, where a friend’s children study, there have been racist attacks. It’s dawning on us that, may be, we don’t really belong despite having been here all our lives / decades. Sorry to add a caution. Mauritius is a wonderful island, but is especially vulnerable to continued climate change and is not investing in infrastructure nearly enough to be properly self-protective. Thank you. I don’t disagree. The island hosts as many tourists as there are residents without the infrastructure. Thanks for the post, Conor. Merz is now pushing for the vote of (no) confidence already next week instead of in January (variety of news sources), which would frankly make more sense than waiting 2 months. My money would be on CDU – Greens – they are perfectly aligned on pumping money and weapons into Ukraine. Anecdotal evidence: dinner with German friends on Friday was a lot about immigration and how the only parts of the economy doing well is armaments and the refugee industry” (housing etc). Where I am near Nurnberg my impression is that the big German growth industry is the refugee industry which really has been fueled by US wars in the global south. We had Iraq, then Afghanistan, then Syria then Sub Saharan Africa and Ukraine all generating millions of refugees to Germany. And now we are seeing masses of Palestinians. Our hospital is very busy, doctors and dentists and psychologists are really busy, support staff is short. The landlords and construction companies are doing really well renovating houses for the Asylanten. The lawyers are doing well. Our local Bosch factory is on life support after massive layoffs but a lot of people are doing well. Germany has a limit on debt and it will need to be lifted. As usual the workers and native Germans will be crushed but the major parties are doing all in their power to marginalize the AFD which does not have a very redistributive economic policy anyway. Made in Germany is going away. Following Scholz’s schedule allows more time for change of the electorate’s opinion. Discontent rarely benefits the status quo. In other words, the formerly ascendant are more likely to lose ground than gain it. I’m long on popcorn. For me, the main problem with Germany is that their mainstream media and, in general, all mainstream media throughout Europe is controlled by Atlanticists to one degree or another and I see no way this will change. The average citizen in Germany and most of Europe want to follow the authorities–as is the case of most countries. We all want to be part of something and to go along to get along–this is human nature. Thus the importance of a ruling class that practices virtue. There is no sign of that in Europe since official Washington has the whip hand with its ability to intimidate and bribe officials–that’s the only way Washington can impose policies on countries like Germany. In my view we have the reversal of the iron-curtain. The Empire is walling itself off–we’ll see if Trump continues with this plan or starts to sabotage it. “…but Germany is on its way to becoming an agrarian society that uses less fossil fuels.” The Morgenthau Plan didn’t get much traction after the war, but now the screw is turning and the German’s appear to be imposing it upon themselves. This will be of little concern to BlackRock and their bloated asset managing brethren, who have developed the practice of rubbing two phennig together to make a euro into a fine art. But it’s scary to think how the German people will respond to being economically disenfranchised. On the other side of Europe, the Ukrainians are currently being reduced to the agrarian mode as well. Why do I not see the Aidar Battalion peacefully retraining as tractor drivers? And the Poles become the strongman of Europe? Next we’ll have the Swedes on the warpath. Where’s Francis Fukuyama when you need him? I brought this up before, but it’s astonishing that Germany will be led by Fred Merz, not just in name, but in spirit. What’ll Ethel think? good to see Fred still making a comedic impact. Germans getting a bit of the taste of what they did to Greece ‘eh ? Thanks to Conor for this crystal clear and concise explanation of the state of politics in Germany. You don’t see this truly helpful reporting in too many places Interesting perspective on the shifting dynamics between Germany, Trump, and the transatlantic relationship. It’s clear that geopolitical tensions are affecting traditional alliances in unexpected ways. On a lighter note, when faced with tough decisions, I often like to let randomness play a role. decide for me yes or no can be a fun way to break the deadlock. Has anyone here used decision-making tools like that in a similar context? “We are not sending American men and women to uphold peace in Ukraine. And we are not paying for it. Get the Poles, Germans, British and French to do it,” There is no way that Russia is going to agree with that – they can do all the peace-keeping themselves, if that is what is required, and EU troops in the Ukraine will be almost the same as the Ukraine joining NATO. Delusion seems still to be the default in the US. Unless Trump and his minions can do much better than that, there will be no ‘stopping the war in 24 hours’ USA could sell the peace keepers if they were Chinese, Iranian and DPRK. The funding would have to be from NATO. The Russians would be happy to guarantee a no fly zone from the Elbe to the Dneipr. The Brit EU peacekeeping plan seems like a Trojan horse. My heart pours out for Western Europe. When I see Vlad invading Youngstown Ohio or Kearney Nebraska I’ll take notice. Ohio and Nebraska are more worth invading than Western Europe. The signs were there for Germany being green with envy about finanancialization schemes when the government was defending the fraudulent Wirecard company. I guess they want more of that than industry. What is shocking is the matter of course by which media in Germany go along this every single day. Imagine a TV reporter on the Titanic´s top deck reporting how the ship is to collide with the iceberg in perfectly normal fashion: “And this is Wolf Blitzer live from the RMS Titanic somewhere in the North Atlantic Ocean. Back to Kate.” This is going to end with the economic collapse of the West. A Germany without its industry does not have the manufacturing capacity to make a large military, and certainly not without Russian natural resources. It will also mean financial ruin. We are seeing the collapse of the EU and NATO together. In some ways, this is a lot like the late USSR. The Western elite desperately want to win and retain their power, but desire and the capability to do so don’t match. Champagne ambitions on Bier money. Really enjoyed all my trips to Germany when younger and thought that if I had to settle down overseas, that Germany would be a good choice. To see a bunch of pathetic wannabes and idiots bring Germany into ruins for no benefit whatsoever is enraging. If it means having the AfD doing a lot of the heavy lifting in getting rid of them, so be it though I am hoping that Sahra Wagenknecht gets to have a big say in Germany’s reform. If the Greens have their way, then Germany will go back to being a pastoral society and they have a lot to answer for. If you had told me in the 80s that all the Greens that I was meeting would one day become a war party of maniacs I would never have believed you. And yet here we are. Even back then there were two sorts of Greens: the ones that were doing their own thing without or against the state and the ones that let themselves be corrupted. I saw it in the squatters movement in Berlin. About half signed contracts, got fantastic bonuses whereas the other half refused the money and got evicted. The ones with the bonuses are now the green uppercrust and are basically running the city. The others are leading todays antiwar movement, support Wagenknecht or even the AFD. I am part of the second cohort. What gives me hope is that we were looking to the old communists who resisted Hitler for inspiration. We managed quite a change! Now we are the old ones and there are young people who are looking at us for inspiration. Young people always question the Status Quo and they certainly don´t find any role models among todays Greens. This was good. The advantage of reading it a day late is I get all the comments. There’s little argument over Connor’s presentation of the situation and a lot of speculation over coalition. Germany, Europe, the EU and UK are all on a hard right swing. I think the CDU+CSU – AfD coalition could happen. You can coopt the AfD with coalition bribes, then domesticate it and then, like the Greens, in the next election it will be weaker. Idk. Chancellor Olaf Scholz finally threw in the towel when he fired Finance Minister Chrisitan Lindner over his renewed commitment to fiscal prudence after two years of lavishing gifts on Ukraine. That is not how i understand what happened. Lindner didn’t want to achieve financial prudence. His goal were tax reductions for the rich coupled with cuts for cities and municipalities and in social security, and cuts to the climate / green / ecological spending, possibly coupled with subsidies for the cat industry (though i’m not really sure on the later, his statements i remember seemed to bit a bit unclear about that). That’s not financial prudence, but redistribution to the really wealthy – which wouldn’t help germany at all (but certainly would help the FDP). Finacial prudence is a combination of words often used by the FDP, but for them it doesn’t mean the same as for other people. It’s commonly assumed that the country’s vassalage explains its recent ineptness. While there’s certainly some truth to that, … I think your analysis is mostly right, but i’m opposed to any explanations of the german misery which start with external factors. We are able to screw up without outside help. The dependency on exports was our own doing. The dependency on the automobile industry was our own doing. The inability to build up industry around new technologies was our doing. Our near-total inability to change is our doing. And our doom. Ukraine help, however costly, is not our greatest problem. Germany’s economy had been sputtering for some time. There’s only so long you can rely on wage suppression and low investment. Right. And low education. The German social partnership model — which rests on the lie that the interests of capital and labor can peacefully coexist — is getting the final nail in the coffin after years of feckless leadership whose main goal was putting a happy face on wage and benefit cuts. (This is probably long overdue and possibly one positive outcome of the events of the last few years.) I’m not so optimistical. The social partnership model is a relict of a long dead world, it’s architects are dead and can’t defend their brain child anymore, and so it will be kept alive with warm words at least from SDP and CDU/CSU. Why should a succesful deception be buried? trade war […] rely on from China like certain drugs, chemicals and materials have no substitutes. I think we start to realize that. A bit late, but… well, at last we do :-) Who’s riding in to save the day for Germany? None other than [checks notes] former BlackRock board member Friedrich Merz. I hate that thought, but that doesn’t mean you are wrong. Fun fact: our current, new, finance minister was Goldman Sachs co-chief of the germany austria region. One might think that the sell-out only just started. One might also think that Scholz sees no chance to survive the next election. Your email address will not be published.

Smaller cryptocurrencies—including ethereum, up 30%, dogecoin, up 50%, and cardano, up 70%—have also exploded higher. Now, as the Federal Reserve and China feed into a "perfect storm" for the bitcoin price, rumors are swirling that a country has been quietly buying up bitcoin.

[+] pulling the price of smaller cryptocurrencies with it. "There is at least one nation state that has been actively acquiring bitcoin and is now a top five holder," David Bailey, the chief executive of Bitcoin Magazine publisher Bitcoin Inc and advisor to the Trump election campaign on bitcoin strategy, posted to X. "Hopefully we hear from them soon." The top five countries currently holding bitcoin are the U.S. with just over 200,000 bitcoin, China with almost 200,000, the U.K. with 61,000, Ukraine with almost 50,000 bitcoin, Bhutan with around 13,000 and El Salvador with some 5,000. Most of the bitcoin held by countries is via seizure from criminals while Ukraine's bitcoin mostly comes from donations following Russia's 2022 invasion. Rumors and speculation that countries are buying up bitcoin have been swirling for years, fueled by El Salvador's adoption of bitcoin as legal tender and experiments in the Himalayan Kingdom of Bhutan with bitcoin mining. Earlier this year, wild speculation swept social media that Qatar had bought hundreds of billions of dollars worth of bitcoin. Donald Trump's promise during a July bitcoin conference in Nashville, Tennessee—organized by Bailey—to make the U.S. the "crypto capital of the planet" and create a bitcoin strategic reserve further stoked sky-high expectations. U.S. senator Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) introduced The Bitcoin Act to Congress in July, calling for the creation of a strategic bitcoin reserve to reduce the U.S.'s spiraling, near-$36 trillion national debt by buying 1 million bitcoin over five years.

Title: Expect a ‘huge sucking sound’ of foreign capital flooding in as U.S. dominance of global finance increases, top economist says

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Wall Street has been flying high as an expected Republican sweep in the election drives hopes for lower taxes and deregulation, and that makes U.S. financial markets more attractive to the rest of the world, a top economist said. In an interview on Bloomberg TV on Friday, Allianz chief economic advisor Mohamed El-Erian was asked if investors should expect a positive growth shock that's accompanied by more inflation. "The direction of travel is clear: More growth, slightly higher inflation, a higher public sector borrowing requirement, and a huge sucking sound where a lot of foreign capital will end up in the U.S.," he replied. The magnitudes of those trends will become more apparent when policies from the incoming Trump administration become clearer—and when the people who will carry them out become known, El-Erian added. Just days after the presidential election, talk of potential Cabinet appointments is already ramping up. On Friday, the Financial Times reported that Robert Lighthizer, who was U.S. Trade Representative during Trump's first term, was asked to fill the post again. The job of Treasury secretary will likely be offered to a financier, the FT added, with hedge fund managers Scott Bessent and John Paulson seen as possibilities. Meanwhile, the rest of the world may have more trouble coping with a period of faster growth and hotter inflation, adding to America's relative edge, El-Erian said. "This is a period in which U.S. dominance of the global system is going to increase, both for positive reasons and for negative reasons in the short term," he explained. "The rest of the world simply cannot build enough pipes around the U.S. They're trying and they've been doing it, but these pipes are very small compared to the size of the U.S." Indeed, despite fears that Trump's tax cuts, tariffs, and immigration crackdown will be inflationary and worsen deficits, bonds yields have come back down after soaring in the immediate aftermath of the election. El-Erian argued that's because U.S. bonds have become more attractive relative to those from other advanced economies. Continued demand for Treasuries would help the federal government finance what's expected to be an explosion of debt under another Trump presidency. Ahead of the election, the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimated that his policies could add $7.5 trillion to the debt and possibly as much as $15.2 trillion. But if investors, especially "bond vigilantes," balk at the enormous volumes of debt the Treasury Department auctions, they could send yields higher and raise borrowing costs across key segments of the economy, like mortgage rates. In a Wall Street Journal op-ed on Tuesday, however, BlackRock Chairman and CEO Larry Fink said faster economic growth would help make U.S. debt more manageable. "If GDP rises at an average of 3% in real terms over the next five years, the country’s debt-to-GDP ratio would stay roughly stable at a high, but reasonable, level," he wrote.

Title: 3 Reasons Why A Crypto Dollar Will Come Sooner Than Expected
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2024/11/09/3-reasons-why-a-crypto-dollar-will-come-sooner-than-expected/
Time Published: 2024-11-09T19:54:38Z
Full Content:
A crypto dollar is not as far-fetched as it might sound As the ramifications of the recent U.S. Presidential election are analyzed by financial markets and crypto investors, one underlying fact might take some crypto investors, policy advocates, and entrepreneurs by surprise. Despite, or perhaps because of, the increased interest and investment that the crypto economy and sector had received during the recent election cycle – powered in no small part by the nearly $200 million spent by crypto lobbyists – the trends toward wider adoption and utilization continue to accelerate. Such a statement might bring to mind examples such as spot ETF products, stablecoin issuers obtaining larger shares of the payment space, or even the launch of stablecoins by TradFi institutions. The above facts and trends are correct, and have driven broader and deeper integration of cryptoassets throughout the economy, but one other institution has recently published comprehensive research on the implications, opportunities, and challenges of stablecoin adoption. The October 2024 report by the U.S. Treasury to Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee - over 100 pages of quantitative analytics and tables regarding borrowing and other Treasury activities – could have reasonably been overlooked in the recent deluge of media information and discourse. That said, in that report there are over 20 pages of graphics and data analyzing the status of stablecoins, use how these stablecoins are using and connected to the U.S. Treasury market, and the benefits of tokenized Treasury activities. Put simply, these data points paint a road map for how and why the U.S. Treasury could quickly and comprehensively become a major user of tokenized payments and stablecoins; let’s take a look at a few of them. One of the more interesting data points presented in this report is that the continued growth and proliferation of stablecoins has also led to a increase in the demand for short-dated Treasuries. Citing the analytics of Tether (issuer of USDT) $68.3% of total collateral held by the organization was in the form of U.S. Treasury Bills. In addition to the direct purchase of Treasuring by stablecoin issuers to serve as collateral for the tokens themselves, the report also puts forward another way in which stablecoins are increasing the demand for Treasuries. When compared to the larger cryptoassets and products that provide exposure to bitcoin (such as spot ETFs), stablecoins are viewed as lower risk, which can funnel investor dollars into these instruments during periods of market volatility. Additionally, as the digital asset sector grows, Treasuries may serve a role as an indirect hedge against inflation and – ultimately – a low volatility on-chain alternative to stablecoins. As the dollar faces increasing competition for its role as global reserve currency, and foreign buyers of debt may reallocate funds in future, stablecoins may grow into an alternative buyer in the future. Another fact that might surprise some crypto investors is that, even after years of an ambiguous regulatory environment and antagonistic regulations, tokenized Treasuries already exist, albeit at a modest level of approximately $2 billion. For example, tokenized treasury funds are already available to investors via funds such as Blackrock’s BUIDL Fund and Franklin Templeton’s On-Chain U.S. Government Money Fund. In addition to these projects, including the one via Blackrock (also the leading player in the spot bitcoin ETF space) other options include Ondo Financial, Hashnote, and CoinShares. On top of these projects, Onyx at JP Morgan leverages tokenized Treasuries to provide intraday Treasury-backed repo solutions, with the Treasury also noting that smart contracts allow simplification and automation of Treasury transactions. In other words the U.S. Treasury, while contending with other U.S. regulators and policymakers that have pursued an antagonistic approach, is well aware of the benefits of tokenized Treasuries as well as the reality that multiple projects leveraging these benefits already exist. Improvements to current clearing and settlement processes, more efficient collateral management, and better transparency via tokenized records are all duly noted as benefits for increased tokenization of the U.S. Treasury market. Much has been written about the potential for a strategic bitcoin reserve, with the discussion around this idea only increasing with the election of Donald Trump as the 47th President of the United States. As exciting and arguably important as such a plan and strategic initiative is, it is only a partial solution to the problems and challenges facing the U.S. dollar and broader U.S. competitive interests. In order to remain competitive on a global basis, attract the talent necessary to succeed and lead the various industries of the future (including blockchain and tokenized transactions) the U.S. policy apparatus will need to embrace a multi-pronged approach to tokenization. A strategic bitcoin reserve is an excellent first step toward more comprehensive integration of tokenized transactions, but leveraging tokenization and blockchain transactions to improve the expand U.S. Treasury markets is an essential component of any U.S. oriented crypto plan. Crypto dollars are virtually guaranteed, and might reach mainstream adoption sooner than many crypto investors expect. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

Title: Joe Biden's Illegal Migrant Inflow to Hit 9 Million by January
URL: https://www.breitbart.com/economy/2024/11/09/joe-bidens-illegal-migrant-inflow-hit-nine-million-january/

President Joe Biden’s border deputies will have admitted roughly nine million inadmissible migrants at the southern border by President Trump’s Inauguration Day, according to data quietly released just before the November 5 election. The agency data shows that Biden’s pro-migration chief, Alejandro Mayorkas, registered 10.5 million illegal migrants at the border from January 2021 to June 2024. Out of that total, he blocked only 2.5 million migrants under the Title 42 epidemic rules, which he lifted in mid-2023. He also “returned” home or “removed” just 1.9 million of the 10.5 million migrants. He then released almost 5.9 million migrants into the United States to take Americans’ housing, jobs, and school slots, the federal data states. Yearly repatriations by fiscal year The Cuban-born, pro-migration border chief also stood by as roughly 2.2 million additional “gotaway” migrants sneaked past the border wall. He refused to complete or sufficiently patrol the incomplete wall. From July to October, an additional 600,000 migrants arrived, and roughly 400,000 were allowed through the border. From early November to Trump’s Inauguration Day, January 20, 2025, Mayorkas will have admitted another 300,000 migrants at current rates, with very little resistance from Biden’s deputies. That final flood will bring his inflow to almost nine million inadmissible southern migrants. But Mayorkas’s southern inflow was in addition to the massive legal inflow of roughly three million legal migrants. Biden also welcomed at least 1.5 million Indian and Chinese white-collar visa workers during Biden’s four years. The visa workers shrink Americans’ white-collar salaries, displace Americans from Fortune 500 careers and management, and allow C-Suite executives to disregard professionals‘ expertise in product innovation, service quality, technological security, and business reliability. So Mayorkas’s flood of roughly 15 million illegal, quasi-legal, legal, and temporary migrants adds up to roughly one new migrant for every American birth. His migrant wave was a massive giveaway to investors, who gained roughly $20 in the stock market for every $1 in profit from the resulting lower wages, additional purchases, and higher rents. The profits help to fund an Astroturf Empire of advocacy groups that keep editors from following the money in migration. But his tsunami also washed away Americans’ wages and salaries before they voted in the November election. “Revised labor productivity and cost data now show real (inflation-adjusted) compensation fell 0.2% last year,” a November 7 tweet from economist E.J. Antoni said. “Since ’20, real hourly compensation is down a cumulative 4.2% through ’23 – it’s no wonder why people are mad,” he added: The Biden administration built its economic strategy on Mayorkas’s migrants. For example, the migrants filled many new jobs at lower wages, helping to reduce some forms of inflation as Congress spent hundreds of billions of dollars on Biden’s Bidennomics priorities. However, the flood of migrants also inflated housing costs, leaving huge numbers of younger Americans poorer in 2023 than in 2019. For example, the Cato Institute admitted that Biden’s migrants into Springfield, Ohio, inflated the cost of housing by roughly $75,000 per house. Unsurprisingly, Trump gained a record share of votes in Springfield. Mayorkas’s flood of cheap labor also minimized the incentive for CEOs to raise the productivity of their blue-collar workers. When labor is in short supply, CEOs invest in workplace productivity to help their workers get more done each day. The technology includes “pick and place” robots, automated metal-cutting, and dairy robots, and it allows higher wages, community prosperity, and happy voters. But when labor is plentiful, CEOs can boost short-term profits by cutting investment in favor of hiring disposable, low-wage workers. The Biden-era damage to U.S. productivity has been ignored by the establishment media, but it was marked on November 7, when federal data show that labor productivity grew by less than one percent — or just 0.7 percent per year during Biden’s four years in office. Before Biden’s Extraction Migration strategy, productivity grew at 2.9 percent per year from 1994 to 2004 as U.S. companies began using desktop computers in a wide variety of jobs: Productivity actually fell in 2022 as the desperate and cheap migrant labor flooded into jobs once held by experienced and better-paid American employees. They also flooded into the jobs that could have employed the several million Americans who have fallen out of the workforce as too old, unhealthy, or alienated for busy employers to hire and train. The economic trauma of Biden’s wealth-shifting migration deeply damaged Kamala Harris’s presidential campaign and public support for the 1950s’ “Nation of Immigrants” narrative. It also put Trump and his allies back in power: Once Mayorkas is removed from office and his policies are reversed, the simultaneous rise in wages and loss of migrants will force companies to buy the productivity machinery being developed and built by Americans. For example, Grist.org reported on October 8: Detasseling corn used to be a rite of passage in the Midwest. Teenagers would wade through seas of corn, removing tassels — the bit that looks like a yellow feather duster at the top of each stalk — to prevent unwanted pollination. Extreme heat, drought, and intense rainfall have made this labor-intensive task even harder. And it’s now more often done by migrant farmworkers who sometimes put in 20-hour days to keep up. That’s why Jason Cope, co-founder of farm tech company PowerPollen, thinks it’s essential to mechanize arduous tasks like detasseling. His team created a tool a tractor can use to collect the pollen from male plants without having to remove the tassel. It can then be saved for future crops. “We can account for climate change by timing pollen perfectly as it’s delivered,” he said. “And it takes a lot of that labor that’s hard to come by out of the equation.” “We always used to think [a] shrinking population is a cause for negative [economic] growth,” BlackRock founder Larry Fink said at a pro-globalist event in April hosted by the World Economic Forum in Saudi Arabia. He continued [emphasis added]: But in my conversations with the leadership of these large, developed countries [such as China, and Japan] that have xenophobic anti-immigration policies, they don’t allow anybody to come in — [so they have] shrinking demographics — these countries will rapidly develop robotics and AI and technology … If a promise of all that transforms productivity, which most of us think it will — we’ll be able to elevate the standard living in countries, the standard of living for individuals, even with shrinking populations. When Mayorkas is gone, he will also have left a massive political bomb under the Democrats’ foundational claim to be the noble champions of underdogs, refugees, migrant children, and separated families. Mayorkas’s colonialism-adjacent economic strategy of Extraction Migration has expanded child labor in the United States, traded remittances to dictatorships in exchange for millions of workers, and accelerated the Mexican corruption that helps the cartels smuggle deadly drugs into American communities. His policy drained vital young workers from developing countries for use by Wall Street investors, separated millions of adult migrants from their left-behind wives and children, and helped kill many thousands of migrants in distant jungles, boats, snowstorms, and rivers. “There were two images of his treacherous journey north that he couldn’t get out of his head,” reporter Albinson Linares from Telemundo.com said in 2023 about a Venezuelan migrant named Johan Torres: The first was how a [migrant] person who resisted a robbery in Mexico was killed with a machete; the other happened in the [Panama] jungle, when he saw a man leave behind his young daughter, waist-deep in mud. “He left her there, lying in the mud and crying, and I couldn’t do anything because I was dying of exhaustion. But I can’t forget that,” he said with tears in his eyes. “Failure has many fathers, but Mayorkas is the first among equals,” Mark Krikorian, director of the Center for Immigration Studies, told Breitbart News.

Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds launched less than a year ago and have already been dubbed the most successful ETF launches in history. BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF, the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), just smashed another record. To be more precise, IBIT has now overtaken the asset manager’s iShares Gold ETF (IAU) in terms of assets under management — a huge milestone given that the former investment vehicle only started trading in mid-January this year. BlackRock’s IBIT now holds more assets than the Wall Street behemoth’s gold ETF despite only launching 10 months ago. The iShares Gold ETF debuted in January 2005 and has since accumulated 32.96 billion in net assets. For comparison, the IBIT has amassed an impressive $33.17 billion in assets — a milestone the president of The ETF Store, Nate Geraci, called “absolutely wild.” Bitcoin and gold are often considered comparable safe-haven assets, with most crypto industry pundits long treating BTC as “digital gold.” BlackRock Bitcoin ETF’s bullish strength was arguably boosted by Donald Trump’s U.S. presidential election victory. During his campaign, Trump loudly supported the crypto sector. The company’s Bitcoin fund registered its highest-ever trading volume of $4.1 billion on the day Trump won the presidency. As ZyCrypto covered, the trading activity even surpassed the daily volume posted by blue chip stocks like Netflix, Berkshire Hathaway, and Visa during the same timeframe — a sign of excitement among investors that the president-elect will keep all his many promises to nurture the crypto industry, replace unpopular regulators and allow crypto entrepreneurs to introduce products without fear of lawsuits or Wells Notices from agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission. Data from Farside reveals that IBIT has clocked more than $27 billion in net inflows since its debut, with a record-breaking $1.1 billion in new investor money flowing into the ETF on Thursday, an extraordinary demonstration of demand for the spot BTC product. Meanwhile, commentators believe Trump’s victory will open the door for over a half dozen proposed cryptocurrency ETFs waiting on approval from U.S. regulators. After the Bitcoin and Ethereum approvals, asset managers have submitted a slew of regulatory filings to list ETFs holding altcoins such as Solana (SOL), Ripple’s XRP, and Litecoin (LTC).

Kathleen Watkins at the InterContinental Hotel in Ballsbridge. Photo by Steve Humphreys The funeral details for broadcaster and wife of Gay Byrne, Kathleen Watkins, have been announced following her death on Thursday at the age of 90. The couple married 60 years ago, in 1964, having met in 1957. They had two daughters, Crona and Suzy. Ms Watkins was born in Saggart, Dublin, and was an acclaimed harpist and folk singer before joining RTÉ. She was the first continuity announcer to appear on screen on the opening night of Ireland’s new television station, Telefís Éireann, on New Year's Eve 1961. The couple raised their family in Howth, north Dublin, and moved southside to Sandymount in their retirement. Ms Watkins’ funeral service will depart from Howth at 11am on Tuesday, arriving for Requiem Mass at 12pm at the Church of the Sacred Heart, Donnybrook, followed by a private burial. Her funeral notice said she died “peacefully on in the wonderful care of the team at the Blackrock Clinic”. "Beloved wife and best friend of the late Gay Byrne, loving mother to Crona and Suzy, adored Nana Kit to Cian, Sadhbh, Kate, Saoirse and Harry, mother-in-law to Philip and Ronan and sister of Clare, Phil and the late Jim. Sadly missed by her family, relatives and a wide circle of treasured friends,” the notice read. Ms Watkins fell on the way to mass last year and had been attending Blackrock Clinic since. She passed away five years after her husband, whose fifth anniversary was this week. Her daughter Suzy Byrne told Joe Duffy on RTÉ Radio last week that their family is “devastated, but at the same time realise how lucky we were to have her. She was just unbelievable”. Tributes poured in for Ms Watkins from across the world of politics, media and beyond following the news of her death. President Michael D Higgins said it was with “great sorrow” that he and his wife Sabina learned of her passing. "We were among the many who had the greatest regard and affection for her,” said President Higgins in a statement. "I know that this was shared in particular by all of Kathleen’s colleagues in RTÉ. Sabina and I convey our sympathy to them, along with so many in Ireland’s cultural life to which Kathleen made such a memorable contribution. “These talents were demonstrated through her work as an artist and broadcaster, as well as a writer who was appreciated by people of all ages. “Kathleen was the beloved life partner of Gay Byrne who we remember now, recalling the joy of their unique partnership. We recall also the warmth of Kathleen’s personality, her humour and kindness – she represented the best of her generation in so many ways and during such a formative period in our country.” Join the Irish Independent WhatsApp channel Stay up to date with all the latest news

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Says These 10 Stocks Can Do Well Regardless of Who Wins. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) stands against the other stocks in Jim Cramer's current watchlist. Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, recently shared his thoughts on stocks that could perform well regardless of who ends up running the White House. On Tuesday, Cramer observed that the day’s market performance gave the impression that every stock could go higher no matter who secures the presidency. He pointed to significant gains across various sectors, including aerospace, housing, retail, and healthcare. Cramer noted that this broad-based rally resulted in strong performances on Tuesday, with the Dow climbing 427 points, the S&P rising by 1.23%, and the NASDAQ soaring by 1.43%. However, he tempered his optimism by adding that days like Tuesday might prove to be outliers in the coming weeks. READ ALSO Jim Cramer’s Latest Game Plan: 15 Stocks to Watch and Jim Cramer is Talking About These 7 Stocks Cramer took the opportunity to highlight ten stocks he believes will thrive and said: “I want to highlight ten stocks that I believe will do well under either candidate, a who’s who of acclamation, companies that almost have to do well because of seismic trends and savvy managements. Companies that no White House would get hung up on, either because they’re beneath notice or they’re perceived as good corporate citizens by both sides. Stocks in industries that neither Trump nor Harris have ever targeted in the past.” He also raised an important question for the viewers: “If you had the results of the election in hand, would you really know what to buy or sell?” According to Cramer, answering that question is far more complicated than it seems. He emphasized his list of stocks that can thrive regardless of the election outcome. These are companies that have no clear political adversaries in Washington, making them relatively safe bets. Cramer acknowledged, however, that many stocks that seem like obvious picks for one candidate or another often have hidden dynamics that don’t get enough attention. “In the end, this presidential prognostication game is meaningless until we start hearing about cabinet appointments, those will tell us a lot. Then, we can figure out really who the winners and losers are. Right now, though, there are just too many political angles to every single stock story.” Our Methodology For this article, we compiled a list of 10 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on November 5. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the second quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of more than 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A home theater with family members enjoying streaming content together. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 103 Cramer called Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) a great bargain and remarked that it will not take a hit in the coming days. “Netflix is one of the world's greatest bargains, and because they make programming for all sides of the aisle, you know that it's not gonna get hammered by whoever comes out ahead tonight or this week or next month, whatever. There's no percentage in going after Netflix.” Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) is a leading provider of entertainment services, offering a vast variety of streaming content to millions of subscribers around the world. In October, the company reported its financial results for the third quarter, showing a 15% increase in revenue compared to the same period in the previous year. This growth was accompanied by the addition of over 5 million new subscribers. Spencer Neumann, Netflix’s (NASDAQ:NFLX) Chief Financial Officer, highlighted that there are still "hundreds of millions of households that aren't members," suggesting significant untapped potential for future growth. A key factor driving this expansion has been its advertising-supported subscription tier. Management indicated that the membership for the ad-supported plan grew by 35% year-over-year in the third quarter, though there were some challenges. The company is projecting total revenue for the full year 2024 to exceed $38 billion. Its management also provided guidance for 2025, anticipating revenue to reach between $43 billion and $44 billion, which would represent an approximately 11% year-over-year increase. Overall NFLX ranks 1st on Jim Cramer's list of stocks that can do well regardless of who wins. While we acknowledge the potential of NFLX as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NFLX but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Stocks closed at record highs on Friday, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones, and Nasdaq 100 all notching their biggest weekly gain of the year. Cava (CAVA) might move higher on growing optimism about its earnings prospects, which is reflected by its upgrade to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). While there are strong investment cases for each of the "Magnificent Seven" stocks, I see one as the clear winner for long-term investors. Billionaire Bill Ackman said on Friday he would seek to delist investment firm Pershing Square Holdings and move record label Universal Music Group away from Amsterdam, following attacks on Israeli soccer fans. In a statement on X, Ackman said Pershing Square's board had already been considering the move and "events in Amsterdam during the last 24 hours provide an appropriate tipping point" to follow through. In the attacks, supporters of Israeli football club Maccabi Tel Aviv were targeted after a match, by what Amsterdam's mayor described as "antisemitic hit and run squads". Lantronix (LTRX) delivered earnings and revenue surprises of -33.33% and 7.22%, respectively, for the quarter ended September 2024. Do the numbers hold clues to what lies ahead for the stock? Zacks.com users have recently been watching NextEra Energy Partners (NEP) quite a bit. Thus, it is worth knowing the facts that could determine the stock's prospects. XPeng Inc.

We recently compiled a list of the 11 Trending AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) stands against the other trending AI stocks. The extent to which AI tech may disrupt life as we know it in the coming years is still shrouded in mystery. However, multiple organizations have been making an effort to quantize these changes for a better understanding of the evolving business landscape. For example, the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change, a London-based non-profit group, recently released a report detailing that AI may displace between 1 million to 3 million private sector jobs in the United Kingdom alone in the coming years. However, the report also stressed that the ultimate rise in unemployment will be in the low hundreds of thousands as growth in technology also creates new roles. Estimates from the non-profit suggest that at the peak of AI-led disruption, between 60,000 and 275,000 jobs will be displaced every year over a couple of decades. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. This number was put into larger context by the institute by highlighting that the average number of job losses in the European country over the past decade had been 450,000 a year. The AI-led disruption seems modest compared to these figures, per the report. The report further underlined that a common lesson was that AI was likely to increase the dynamism of the labor market by prompting more workers to leave existing jobs and start new ones. The institute noted that administrative and secretarial jobs would be the most exposed to the new technology, followed by sales and customer service, and banking and finance. The think tank research further claimed that deployment of AI could raise GDP by up to 1% over the next five years, rising to up to 6% by 2035. Read more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities. For this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.

The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

On November 6, Susquehanna analyst Mehdi Hosseini lowered the price target on the stock to $15 from $32.50 and kept a Negative rating on the shares. The advisory updated estimates based on the preliminary results and the guide. In an investor note, the advisory noted that despite a lack of a detailed financial statement and inability to file with the SEC, the updated estimates should still help investors with margin trends, the company's earnings direction, and the implied downside risk to consensus. Overall SMCI ranks 9th on our list of the trending AI stocks on latest news and ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of SMCI as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than SMCI but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: BlackRock’s IBIT sets record $1.1 billion in daily inflows

Time Published: 2024-11-08T23:05:39Z

BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) exchange-traded fund (ETF) set a new record for inflows, reaching $1.12 billion, topping its previous record of $872 million. The new record was noted on SoSoValue and comes when Bitcoin reached an all-time high of $76,677 across major exchanges on November 7. Earlier in the week, Bitcoin broke a new all-time high of $75,317 as voting results signalled a Donald Trump win for the White House. BlackRock’s IBIT net assets now account for $34.29 billion, significantly pushing it ahead of its competitors. In October, BlackRock set a new record when its total assets reached $30 billion in 293 days. Dary McGovern, COO of Bitcoin native Xapo Bank, said to CoinJournal that Bitcoin’s new record suggests a “broader shift in institutional confidence, with notable market movements such as BlackRock’s record net inflows into its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT),” adding: “The growing institutional interest underscores Bitcoin’s increasing recognition as a trusted asset class, driven by rising global demand and mainstream adoption. As more investors seek exposure to digital assets, Bitcoin’s role as a store of value and a potential hedge against inflation becomes ever clearer.” The 12 US spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a daily total net inflow of $1.38 billion, also a new record since listing in January. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas noted BlackRock’s new record in a post on X, saying: “Even I am surprised it’s that big, by far biggest one day flow of any BTC ETF ever.” Told y’all it was prob gonna be big, altho even I am surprised it’s that big, by far biggest one day flow of any btc etf ever. https://t.co/Q5MPDMrTYv — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) November 8, 2024 Balchunas later added that the spot Bitcoin ETFs have taken in a combined $6.7 billion in the past month and $25.5 billion year to date, and are 93% of the way to passing Satoshi Nakamoto’s 1.1 million Bitcoin. HOOVER CITY: Bitcoin ETFs took in a record-smashing $1.4b yesterday (the Trump effect). $IBIT alone was +$1.1b. That's +$6.7b in past mo and $25.5b YTD. All told they feasted on about 18k btc in one day (vs 450 mined) and are now 93% of the way to passing Satoshi's 1.1mil btc. pic.twitter.com/dNLoENlDB3 — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) November 8, 2024 “This confidence suggests that Bitcoin is now seen as a legitimate hedge and growth asset, particularly appealing amid traditional market uncertainties and as regulatory clarity improves,” said James Toledano, COO at Unity, a self-custody crypto wallet, to CoinJournal. “Just look at pension funds in both the UK and US investing in Bitcoin too. Sentiment has changed massively in such a short space of time.” Grayscale’s GBTC, the second-largest by net assets at $16.80 billion, saw a net inflow of $7.31 million. Fidelity’s FBTC reported $190.92 million and Ark and 21Shares saw $17.61 million.

November 08, 2024 17:34 ET | Source: BlackRock Asset Management Canada Limited (iShares) BlackRock Asset Management Canada Limited (iShares) TORONTO, Nov. 08, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BlackRock Asset Management Canada Limited (“BlackRock Canada”), an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of BlackRock, Inc. (“BlackRock”) (NYSE: BLK) today announced that it has called a special meeting of unitholders (the “Meeting”) of the iShares Premium Money Market ETF (the “iShares Fund”), to be held on or about January 22, 2025 to approve a change to the investment objective of the iShares Fund to permit investments in asset-backed commercial paper (the “Proposal”). BlackRock Canada is holding the Meeting solely as a virtual (online) meeting by way of live audio webcast. The proposed change to the iShares Fund investment objective is as follows: Following the cessation of the Canadian Dollar Offered Rate in June 2024, the bankers’ acceptance (“BA”) based lending model has largely been discontinued in Canada. The discontinuation of BAs has materially reduced the iShares Fund’s access to credit exposure, which is an important source of yield. BlackRock Canada believes that Canadian dollar denominated asset-backed commercial paper is an appropriate investment opportunity for the iShares Fund in order to continue accessing investment-grade, short-term Canadian dollar credit instruments. Credit exposure is an important tool for maximizing income while maintaining liquidity. The asset-backed commercial paper market in Canada is limited to bank-sponsored issuers and has undergone significant reform since the 2007/2008 financial crisis, resulting in enhanced investor protections. The market has continued to grow in response to the discontinuation of BAs and bank-sponsored asset-backed commercial paper is one of the primary instruments used by Canadian money market funds to obtain credit exposure. In accordance with applicable securities laws, a joint management information circular relating to the Proposal (the “Circular”) will be made available to unitholders in advance of the Meeting. Notice of the Meeting and information outlining the procedures for accessing the Circular online (or requesting a copy thereof) will be mailed on or about December 20, 2024. Unitholders of record of the iShares Fund at the close of business on December 5, 2024, will be entitled to receive notice of, and vote at, the Meeting. The Circular will also be made available on www.sedarplus.ca and www.blackrock.com/ca and will include additional details regarding the Proposal. BlackRock Canada believes that the proposed investment objective change is in the best interests of the iShares Fund. If the change to the investment objective is approved by unitholders of the iShares Fund, BlackRock Canada expects that the Proposal will be effective as of January 31, 2025. Implementation of the Proposal is subject to applicable regulatory approvals, including the approval of the Toronto Stock Exchange.
