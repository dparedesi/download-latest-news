Title: Jim Cramer on Abbott Laboratories (ABT): ‘Not Understood Very Well Because They’re Doing Tremendous Stuff When It Comes To Diabetes. People Don’t Seem To Care’

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Discusses Joe Rogan, Elon Musk, And These 13 Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) stands against the other stocks. In one of his latest appearances on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer started the morning by commenting on the latest Producer Price Index (PPI) release. The PPI, which tracks inflation upstream of the supply chain, rose by 0.2% in December and fell short of economist expectations of 0.3%. However, this didn't lead to any significant reaction in the bond market. According to Cramer, "Carl these, the bonds just don't want to react to anything good. Of course, we can immediately say, it's because we're gonna get a tough CPI number tomorrow. The fact is, is these numbers are tame. People have to start recognizing that there are some good numbers coming." He shared other factors that might be fueling the bond market's performance. "House prices coming down, food coming down, but it doesn't seem to matter," Cramer remarked. He added "What the bonds are reacting to I think is a new administration, uh, concern about what is going to be, uh, tariffs, even though it looks like they're going to be phased in. You know David, interest rates don't wanna come down here. And they don't wanna come down there's too much issuance, there's a belief that the next administration is much more inflationary. And David it doesn't seem to matter what is printed, the bonds don't want to go higher. Interest rate's not low enough." Another news that has made a lot of headlines recently is TikTok's fate in the US. Cramer believes that rather than a complete bank, there could "be a gradual diminution of the service. In other words, it's not going to be turned off. I think that this whole idea that the Chinese Communist Party is really just a gigantic private equity firm leaves me cold. I just don't think that they are in a situation to broker a deal." One person that the CNBC TV show host believes isn't discussed enough is electric vehicle billionaire Elon Musk. "I mean, Carl, it's so exciting to talk about Elon Musk. I mean we haven't talked about Elon, you know you have to wait maybe to nine o' four to talk about Elon Musk. I just say we do it at the very top," believes Cramer. He added "We have Elon Musk being the most important, well, he's, he's co-president right now which I think is a little absurd.. . . this man has become, Carl, a nation-state within. He's a state within a state." On the topic of markets, Cramer was appreciative of the fact that the market and equal-weighted benchmark S&P indexes are up identically over the last six months "Well look I, that's good news actually. We want to have broader leadership," he remarked. However, without Wall Street's favorite AI stock, Cramer believes "you have a market that's kind of ruthless. . . David, you know that this market survives on NASDAQ fuel and not on Dow fuel. And yet people still insist on talking about the Dow." Finally, Cramer has also spent quite a bit of time discussing social media CEO Mark Zuckerberg's appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast. This time around, he shared "I'll go right to Joe Rogan. I'll be five hours in Joe Rogan. One of the most jarring things about the Joe Rogan interview was that he said he had to take a bathroom break. Well, there's professionalism personified." Cramer also commented on whether 38% is too much for an interviewer to speak. Taking a mixed view, he stated "I think it is. I used to put a stopwatch to my show Kudlow & Cramer. I got to speak 38% of the time so you know what, maybe it's not so bad." Our Methodology To make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC’s Squawk on the Street aired yesterday. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 63 Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is one of the biggest healthcare and pharmaceutical companies in the world. The firm's shares are flat year-to-date and they closed 2024 just 3.8% higher. While the broader pharmaceutical industry didn't perform well last year due to interest rates and inflationary pressures, some of Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT)'s struggles were specific to the firm. The firm was ordered to pay $495 million in damages related to its infant formula in July. The stock soared by 4.6% in November after a jury cleared it of liability. Here's what Cramer said about Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT): "Abbott, not understood very well because they're doing tremendous stuff when it comes to diabetes. People don't seem to care." Overall ABT ranks 7th on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of ABT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than ABT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Abbott (ABT) has been one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com users lately. So, it is worth exploring what lies ahead for the stock. Shares of Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ: WBA) fell sharply last year as a combination of declining vaccine demand, headwinds on consumer discretionary spending, and misguided acquisitions led to a series of dismal earnings reports from the company. As a result, Walgreens was forced to cut its dividend, took a multibillion-dollar impairment charge, and lost its place in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI). Walgreens fell steadily through the first three quarters of the year as the company missed estimates and cut guidance, and Wall Street's view of the stock soured.

Title: TikTok Plans ‘Immediate’ Shutdown of App in U.S. on Jan. 19 If Supreme Court Doesn’t Block Ban: Reports
URL: https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/tiktok-immediate-shutdown-jan-19-supreme-court-ban-1236274933/

By Todd Spangler NY Digital Editor TikTok is preparing to go dark for U.S. users this Sunday if the Supreme Court does not grant its emergency appeal to halt a law that will ban the app unless Chinese parent ByteDance divests its stake, according to reports. TikTok is in danger of being banned in the U.S. under a federal law set to take effect Sunday, Jan. 19, unless the Supreme Court grants an injunction blocking it. On Wednesday, the court did not issue a ruling in the matter. At this point, TikTok plans an “immediate” shut down of the app for U.S. users unless the Supreme Court grants a reprieve, The Information reported, citing anonymous sources. Reuters also reported on TikTok’s preparations to suspend service for American users in the absence of a favorable Supreme Court ruling.

In addition, TikTok plans to give users an option to download their data, according to the report. Popular on Variety TikTok did not respond to requests for comment. In a message sent to staffers Tuesday, TikTok’s HR chief said U.S. employees will continue to have their jobs even if the app ban goes into effect, as reported by the New York Times. “Your employment, pay and benefits are secure, and our offices will remain open, even if this situation hasn’t been resolved before the January 19 deadline,” TikTok global head of HR Nicky Raghavan said in the message. “The bill is not written in a way that impacts the entities through which you are employed, only the U.S. user experience.” On Friday, Jan. 10, the Supreme Court heard arguments in TikTok’s emergency appeal seeking to block the law, with TikTok and ByteDance arguing that the law violates First Amendment rights of its 170 million U.S. users. The justices seemed to lean toward being more receptive to the government’s position — that TikTok represents a national security threat, as it falls under the jurisdiction of the Chinese Communist Party. ByteDance has said 60% of its ownership is represented by “global institutional investors” including Blackrock, General Atlantic and Susquehanna International Group. Chinese officials have been exploring the potential for ByteDance to sell its stake to tech mogul Elon Musk, Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal reported this week. A TikTok spokesperson called that “pure fiction.” The law passed Congress with bipartisan support and was signed by President Biden in April 2024. U.S. lawmakers have expressed concern about TikTok’s Chinese ownership, suggesting the Chinese communist regime could use the app to spy on Americans or use it to spread pro-China propaganda. The law, called the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, prohibits Apple and Google’s app stores and web hosting services from distributing TikTok in the U.S. unless ByteDance sells its ownership stake in the app to any party located in a country that is not designated a “foreign adversary” of the United States.

Title: In Larry Fink's 100th earnings call, the BlackRock CEO spoke about private markets and retirement — but not his own

At least one thing remains the same from when BlackRock went public a quarter of a century ago: Larry Fink's pre-earnings call dinner. Fink, speaking on his 100th earnings call Wednesday, said — despite the many changes to the firm and the world over the past 25 years — he has had a bowl of cereal with blueberries the night before each call. Now, with $11.6 trillion in assets and a record $641 billion in net inflows in 2024, BlackRock is looking toward private markets for its next evolution. "This just the beginning," Fink said. The firm hopes to close its acquisition of private credit giant HPS in the second quarter, he said and has already integrated infrastructure investor GIP. Data platform Preqin — which BlackRock is set to buy for $3.2 billion — will make the private markets more accessible, Fink said, because of its data and analytics capabilities. Altogether, the biggest opportunity for the firm is taking these strategies downmarket to individual retirement plans and managed account models. Private market players are anticipating that the incoming Trump administration, which has promised a deregulatory push, to allow private equity and credit assets into pension plans such as 401ks. The ideal portfolio blend, Fink said, is no longer the 60-40 portfolio of stocks and bonds that was the standard for so long. Alternatives are needed to diversify properly, and BlackRock plans to offer them. There's close to $10 trillion in money-market funds Fink expects will "be put to work" soon, and "income-oriented products" like private credit and infrastructure investments should be at the top of the list. While he's hoping to get private markets strategies into 401ks, Fink did not address his own potential retirement. Mark Wiedman, a potential successor to Fink, is leaving the asset manager. Fink said on the call that Wiedman's departure was discussed for months and he will stay on through the spring to help with the transition. "Rob and I are proud of the deep leadership team at BlackRock," he said, referring to firm president Rob Kapito. He said talent is "the most important thing we invest in each and every year," stating that a new generation of leaders is being developed. Those new leaders will be the ones who will determine what BlackRock's next 25 years look like and where it will grow next. They just need to be careful not to blink. "It goes by quick," said Bill Katz, TD Cowen's analyst, on the call, reminiscing about covering BlackRock's IPO. Jump to

The outcome of the shutdown would be different from that mandated by the law. The law would mandate a ban only on new TikTok downloads on Apple or Google app stores, while existing users could continue using it for some time. Under TikTok's plan, people attempting to open the app will see a pop-up message directing them to a website with information about the ban, the sources said, requesting anonymity as the matter is not public. The company also plans to give users an option to download all their data so that they can take a record of their personal information, they said. TikTok and its Chinese parent, ByteDance, did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment. The Information first reported the news. Privately held ByteDance is about 60% owned by institutional investors such as Blackrock and General Atlantic, while its founders and employees own 20% each. It has more than 7,000 employees in the United States. President Joe Biden had in April last year signed a law requiring ByteDance to sell its U.S. assets by Jan. 19, 2025, or face a nationwide ban. Last week, the U.S. Supreme Court seemed inclined to uphold the law, despite calls from President-elect Donald Trump and lawmakers to extend the deadline. Trump, whose inauguration takes place the day after the law goes into effect, has said he should have time after taking office to pursue a "political resolution" of the issue. TikTok and ByteDance have sought, at the very least, a delay in the implementation of the law, which they say violates the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment protection against government abridgment of free speech. TikTok said in a court filing last month it estimates one-third of the 170 million Americans using its app would stop accessing the platform if the ban lasts a month. Got a confidential news tip?

Business :Aligned Data Centers, which specializes in AI-related infrastructure, said on Wednesday it had completed another round of capital raise of more than $12 billion. Artificial intelligence requires enormous computing power, pushing demand for specialized data centers that enable technology companies to link thousands of chips together in clusters. The capital raise includes $5 billion of new primary equity — comprising funds managed by Macquarie Asset Management — and more than $7 billion of new debt commitments. Plano, Texas-based Aligned said that the proceeds from the capital raise will be used in the development of its planned future capacity of over 5 gigawatts across Canada, North America and Latin America. The enormous uptake of AI, both in business and personal use, has prompted a host of companies, from startups to bellwether companies like Microsoft and Blackrock, to invest in AI data centers. In September, the two companies said that they plan to launch a more than $30 billion fund to invest in AI infrastructure to build data centers and energy projects. Earlier this month, Microsoft said that it is planning to pledge about $80 billion in fiscal 2025 on developing data centers to train AI models and deploy AI and cloud-based applications. Crusoe, another AI infrastructure provider, secured $600 million in a late-stage funding round last month, valuing the startup at $2.8 billion.

01/15 update below.

Unlock over $3,000 in NFT, web3 and crypto perks — Apply now! The bitcoin price rocketed higher in the aftermath of Donald Trump's election victory in November, with Trump last month confirming he's planning to drop a bitcoin price bombshell. Now, as the Federal Reserve braces for a looming crisis, Trump, the self-styled crypto president, will reportedly issue several crypto-related executive orders on his first day back in the White House, January 20—with one predicted to spark a huge bitcoin price boom.

[+] crypto executive orders—predicted to send the bitcoin price soaring. Trump's day-one executive orders may address issues including de-banking and the repeal of a controversial crypto accounting policy requiring banks holding bitcoin and crypto to count them as liabilities on the bank's own balance sheet. "The Trump team has made it very clear that this is a priority," an anonymous source told the Washington Post. 01/15 update: Bitcoin has surged following the latest U.S. data that showed headline prices climbed as expected but core inflation, striping out food and fuel, came in slightly below predictions. The bitcoin price has rocketed toward $100,000 per bitcoin, almost entirely erasing its early January decline. The inflation data means the Federal Reserve may be more inclined than previously thought to reduce interest rates through 2025, feeding risk assets such as bitcoin with increased liquidity. "Bitcoin is also currently undergoing a local test as its price surpasses the $97,000 mark," Alex Kuptsikevich, the FxPro chief market analyst, said in comments ahead of the inflation data drop. "It is now challenging the 50-day moving average from below, a level it dropped beneath just over a week ago. The rally, with global equity indices relatively neutral, indicates a gradual recovery in risk appetite." The bitcoin price recovery from a dip last week, may now have "run its course," according to Geoff Kendrick, head of crypto research at Standard Chartered Bank, who maintained his bullish bitcoin price prediction for 2025 in an emailed note. "We would recommend accumulating longs again," Kendrick wrote. "We continue to target bitcoin at the $200,000 level by end-2025 as institutional inflows resume under the Trump administration." The mysterious, unconfirmed so-called "Operation ChokePoint 2.0"—named for a similar, 2013 U.S. Department of Justice policy to de-bank legal industries deemed to be high risk for fraud and money laundering—has weighed on crypto companies through the Biden administration, with founders and executives claiming financial regulators have pressured banks to cut off crypto companies from financial services. The issue was recently catapulted into mainstream consciousness by venture capitalist Marc Andreessen's appearance on Joe Rogan's podcast. Andreessen, who has backed many tech and crypto companies at the VC company known as a16z and is an associate of Trump's so-called crypto czar David Sacks, is reportedly working with Trump’s incoming administration behind the scenes. Meanwhile, crypto companies led by MicroStrategy's Michael Saylor have been campaigning against the policy that requires companies to report crypto as a liability, a result of a March 2022 Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) staff accounting bulletin, SAB121. The repeal of SAB121 is one of the three catalysts Saylor said would trigger a bitcoin price rally to $5 million—giving bitcoin a total market capitalization of $100 trillion.

Last year, Saylor, who has transformed his software company into a bitcoin-buying vehicle over the last five years, said during an X broadcast that the repeal of SAB121 will help "take us to $5 million a coin" as companies and financial institutions begin buying bitcoin. "The other two [catalysts named by Salyor] have already happened (spot [exchange-traded funds] ETFs and fair value accounting)," Julian Fahrer, the chief executive of bitcoin rewards company Apollo, posted to X. Last year, the world's largest asset manager BlackRock led a Wall Street rush into the newly approved spot bitcoin ETFs, with its IBIT bitcoin fund becoming one of the fastest growing ETFs of all time as traders piled in.

Title: BlackRock CEO predicts decade-long recovery from Los Angeles wildfires
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/blackrock-ceo-predicts-decadelong-recovery-from-los-angeles-wildfires-93CH-3814203
Time Published: 2025-01-15T13:28:16Z
Full Content:
Investing.com -- BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK).'s Chief Executive Officer, Larry Fink, has projected that the recovery from the recent wildfires in Los Angeles could take up to a decade. The fires, which have been active for a week and are still largely uncontrolled, have caused extensive damage, leading to a rethink of homeowners’ insurance policies over the next four years. Fink, himself a Los Angeles native, said during an interview with CNBC that these fires might necessitate a redefinition of event risk in various parts of the country. He emphasized that homeowners’ insurance is increasingly becoming a significant aspect of home ownership, especially in light of such large-scale destruction. The BlackRock CEO's comments were made public following the company's announcement of its fourth-quarter earnings on Wednesday. He pointed out that the wildfires have not only destroyed entire neighborhoods but also essential infrastructure, schools, and supermarkets. Fink stressed that the recovery from such widespread damage is not a quick fix, predicting a recovery period of five to ten years. Insurance losses from the wildfires are currently estimated to be as high as $40 billion. The National Weather Service has warned that parts of Los Angeles and Ventura counties will continue to face "extreme fire danger" at least until Wednesday afternoon local time. However, conditions are expected to improve slightly on Thursday as the winds shift. The wildfires have resulted in at least 24 fatalities and have incinerated entire neighborhoods. Describing the ongoing fires as "horrible to watch," Fink's predictions underscore the long-term implications of these devastating wildfires on homeowners and the insurance industry.

Title: AGNC Investment Corp. (AGNC): Among the Monthly Dividend Stocks With Over 5% Yield
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/agnc-investment-corp-agnc-among-130346516.html

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 12 Monthly Dividend Stocks with Over 5% Yield. In this article, we are going to take a look at where AGNC Investment Corp. (NASDAQ:AGNC) stands against the other dividend stocks. Dividend stocks have always been a go-to choice for investors, no matter how frequently they receive payouts. Companies carefully decide how often to reward their shareholders. While annual or semi-annual dividends can offer larger sums, their unpredictability can leave investors in a bit of a pickle. Most major firms stick to quarterly payouts for practical reasons, but some opt for monthly distributions, which many investors find appealing as they provide a steady flow of passive income. Monthly payouts offer immediate cash flow, helping with day-to-day financial management. Moreover, a cut in monthly dividends would have a smaller immediate impact, making them feel almost like a regular paycheck. However, history shows that while companies offering monthly dividends may offer higher yields, they sometimes fall short on maintaining consistent dividend policies. Regardless of how often they are paid, dividend stocks have delivered impressive returns over the years. Investors often aim to reduce risk in their portfolios, and dividend stocks offer a dependable way to do so. A report by S&P Dow Jones Indices underscored the growing importance of dividends as a source of personal income. Over the years, dividend income has consistently increased, rising from 2.68% in late 1980 to 7.88% by mid-2024. In contrast, interest income has declined, falling from 14.58% to 7.61% during the same timeframe. Analysts also suggest adding dividend stocks to portfolios due to the advantages they offer. Savita Subramanian, an equity and quant strategist at Bank of America Corp., also recommended that investors increase their holdings of dividend stocks. Here are some comments from the analyst: “You want to be in safe dividends — and I know this is the most boring call of all time, but sometimes boring is good. We believe that we are now in a total return world in which the contribution of dividends to total market returns could be significantly higher than it was in the last decade, a period marked by falling cash yields and lofty price returns. We advise investors to seek out companies with above-market and secure (not stretched) dividend yields.” Within dividend strategy, investors are increasingly drawn to companies that regularly boost their dividends, prompting many firms to focus on sustaining and growing these payments, even in tough economic times. This approach has proven effective, as companies with a track record of dividend growth have yielded impressive long-term returns. A report by Cohen & Steers highlighted that from 2000 to 2010, dividend-paying firms outperformed their non-paying counterparts by an annual margin of 620 basis points, while also experiencing significantly lower risk, as indicated by standard deviation. Over a 30-year period ending in 2011, the advantages of dividend-paying companies became even clearer, with those initiating or increasing dividends consistently outperforming both other dividend-payers and non-payers, delivering higher returns with less volatility. Although dividend stocks underperformed in 2024, their outlook remains promising. Analysts expect a strong rebound for these stocks, especially with the addition of several major tech companies to the dividend-paying ranks, signaling potential growth in this sector. Given this, we will take a look at some of the best dividend stocks that pay monthly dividends. Our Methodology: For this article, we looked through a list of companies that pay monthly dividends and picked those with yields above 5% as of January 14. While analysts don't usually recommend stocks with extremely high dividend yields because they may indicate financial issues, we chose companies with a consistent history of stable dividends despite their high yields. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of their dividend yields. We also considered hedge fund sentiment around each stock using Insider Monkey’s data for Q3 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

Dividend Yield as of January 14: 15.58% AGNC Investment Corp. (NASDAQ:AGNC) is an American real estate investment trust company that mainly invests in residential mortgage-backed securities. The company's net spread and dollar roll income per share, which is the key metric for assessing its profits, decreased over the past year due to a sluggish mortgage market and slower-than-expected interest rate cuts by the Fed. However, its tangible net book value per share increased year-over-year as the value of its underlying investments rose. Despite the associated risks, AGNC Investment Corp. (NASDAQ:AGNC) is still a solid investment. As a mortgage REIT, it invests in mortgages that have been packaged into bond-like securities, rather than owning properties and leasing them to tenants like most REITs. In some respects, it operates like a mutual fund, with the company's value being tied to the value of its mortgage securities portfolio. In addition, as of June 30, 2024, the company’s investment portfolio was valued at $66.0 billion. This portfolio comprised $59.7 billion in Agency MBS, $5.3 billion in net forward purchases or sales of Agency MBS in the "to-be-announced" market, and $1.0 billion in credit risk transfer (CRT) and non-Agency securities, along with other mortgage credit investments. AGNC Investment Corp. (NASDAQ:AGNC) has been making regular dividend payments to shareholders since it went public in 2008. The company shifted to monthly payments in 2014. Since 2008, it has returned $13.4 billion to shareholders through dividends. It pays a monthly dividend of $0.12 per share and has a dividend yield of 15.58%, as of January 14. AGNC Investment Corp. (NASDAQ:AGNC) was popular among elite funds in Q3 2024 with 24 hedge funds holding stakes in the company, up from 19 in the previous quarter, according to Insider Monkey's database. These stakes have a consolidated value of more than $230.3 million. With over 12 million shares, Citadel Investment Group was the company's leading stakeholder in Q3. Overall AGNC ranks 3rd on our list of the best monthly dividend stocks with over 5% yield. While we acknowledge the potential of AGNC as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AGNC but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 12 Monthly Dividend Stocks with Over 5% Yield. In this article, we are going to take a look at where PennantPark Floating Rate Capital Ltd. (NYSE:PFLT) stands against the other dividend stocks. Dividend stocks have always been a go-to choice for investors, no matter how frequently they receive payouts. Companies carefully decide how often to reward their shareholders. While annual or semi-annual dividends can offer larger sums, their unpredictability can leave investors in a bit of a pickle. Most major firms stick to quarterly payouts for practical reasons, but some opt for monthly distributions, which many investors find appealing as they provide a steady flow of passive income. Monthly payouts offer immediate cash flow, helping with day-to-day financial management. Moreover, a cut in monthly dividends would have a smaller immediate impact, making them feel almost like a regular paycheck. However, history shows that while companies offering monthly dividends may offer higher yields, they sometimes fall short on maintaining consistent dividend policies. Regardless of how often they are paid, dividend stocks have delivered impressive returns over the years. Investors often aim to reduce risk in their portfolios, and dividend stocks offer a dependable way to do so.

Title: Meta's performance-based cuts could kick off a wider trend in tech
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-mark-zuckerberg-plan-fire-low-performers-tech-trend-2025-1
Time Published: 2025-01-15T12:28:47Z
Full Content:
Hello there! Business Insider's Alistair Barr thought he was doing the right thing when he discouraged a colleague from joining a little-known startup back in 2016. Turns out he was wrong. Really wrong. The startup was OpenAI, and the former colleague, who thankfully didn't listen, is now an AI billionaire. In today's big story, Meta is looking to quickly get rid of low performers with companywide cuts as it prepares for what Mark Zuckerberg says will be an "intense year." What's on deck Markets: The saga of finding Jamie Dimon's replacement takes another twist. Tech: Microsoft employees across multiple divisions have been laid off. Business: President-elect Donald Trump announces plans for an external revenue service. But first, on the chopping block. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Tired: Move fast and break things. Wired: Move fast and get rid of underperformers. Two years after Mark Zuckerberg's famous "Year of Efficiency" the Meta CEO is ratcheting things up a notch. The tech giant announced plans to cut 5% of its workforce with a focus on the lowest performers, Business Insider's Jyoti Mann and Hugh Langley report. Based on Meta's most-recent earnings report, that would amount to about 3,600 roles. In a memo to staff, Zuckerberg said the company is entering an "intense year" and the decision was made to "move out low-performers faster." So how does Meta plan on doing that? Jyoti and Pranav Dixit got their hands on an internal memo from a human-resources executive explaining how the job cuts will work. The key is reaching a 5% non-regrettable attrition rate this year. In case you don't speak HR mumbo jumbo, that describes workers Meta wouldn't mind losing. To get there, Meta managers will need to identify 12-15% of employees with performance ratings of "Met Most Expectations" or worse. Those who receive ratings of "Met Some" and "Did not Meet" will definitely be fired while those with a "Met Most" rating will be further evaluated by a director and VP before a decision is made. They won't have a lot of time to do it. Employees based in the US will find out about the cuts by February 10. Meta employees had plenty of questions about the strategy. Some got behind the idea. One wrote on an internal message board viewed by Jyoti and Hugh that "there is a need to raise the bar and I absolutely support this." Others, however, weren't as optimistic. Some wondered how — dare I say — efficient the process would be. The process is "marginally better than 'monkey's throwing darts,'" another employee wrote. Like it or not, it might be here to stay. An internal FAQ document viewed by BI hints that performance-related layoffs could become an annual tradition at Meta. The bigger question is whether the approach catches on at other companies. You could argue Zuckerberg's 2023 efficiency push kicked off a wider trend. (Or maybe it was bound to happen anyway.) Regular performance-based cuts aren't the standard in tech like they are in other industries, but they also aren't unheard of. Amazon, in particular, has leaned on performance-improvement plans in recent years. 1. Crypto might be a lot of things, but a currency isn't one of them. For all the attention digital currencies like bitcoin have gotten over the years, the likelihood they'll replace money (as some predicted) still seems farfetched. BI's Adam Rogers writes about how crypto has just become another way for people to gamble. 2. JPMorgan and BlackRock shake-up their executive ranks. Daniel Pinto, the bank's president and COO, will step down in June and plans to retire at the end of 2026. Jennifer Piepszak, currently a co-CEO of JPMorgan's commercial and investment bank, will replace Pinto as COO. The promotion isn't about CEO Jamie Dimon grooming a successor, though. Piepszak doesn't want the top job, leading to more questions about Dimon's succession plans. Meanwhile, the race to succeed another Wall Street titan — BlackRock's Larry Fink — took a turn with the departure of Mark Wiedman, who was widely viewed as a top candidate for the job. 3. What the Los Angeles wildfires mean for the economy. AccuWeather estimates the total economic cost could reach $275 billion. Goldman Sachs says it could rank as one of the costliest natural disasters as a share of GDP in US history. However, the bank isn't concerned about higher insurance costs meaningfully impacting inflation. In the meantime, here's a rundown on who could foot the enormous bill. 1. TikTok's fate hangs in the balance. US users are flocking to the Chinese app RedNote, and TikTok Shop sellers are testing out other e-marketplaces. Selling the app to an American owner isn't out of the question, though — there are reports that Chinese officials are considering an eleventh-hour sale to Elon Musk. MuskTok? Sure, why not. 2. Apple takes a hit despite launching AI iPhones. The tech giant had a standout 2024 with the debut of Apple Intelligence and the Vision Pro. However, its global market share of smartphone sales slipped due to the iPhone losing ground to competitors and its new AI feature not being available in Greater China — one of the company's major markets. 3. Exclusive: Layoffs sweep Microsoft. Employees in security, experiences and devices, sales, and gaming faced job cuts, two people familiar with the matter told BI. The layoffs are separate from the recent cuts targeting low-performers within the company, which BI previously reported. 1. Justin Baldoni's New York Times lawsuit could hinge on an emoji. The "It Ends With Us" director accused the paper of taking his publicists' quotes out of context. He said the paper omitted an emoji — an upside-down smile — that would've made it clear his publicist was being sarcastic, not serious. 2. Trump's got tax plans, but Congress holds the strings. The president-elect vowed to create an "external revenue service" to collect tariffs and revenue from foreign nations on Day One. It's not clear how the new agency would work, but establishing it would require congressional approval. Back home, Americans could see their tax bills change this year since Trump's 2017 package is set to expire. 3. Come for the coffee, stay for the refills. Starbucks announced all its customers — not just rewards members — can get free refills of many brewed coffee and tea drinks at participating stores starting January 27. But the freebies end there, as the company is closing the door on its open-door policy that allows non-paying guests to use store facilities. Gold is one of the 'least effective' inflation hedges, according to Goldman Sachs. Here are three investments that actually protect your portfolio.

Title: Tech workers earn thousands recommending strangers for jobs
URL: https://www.techspot.com/news/106350-tech-workers-earn-thousands-recommending-strangers-jobs.html

TL;DR: A time-honored practice in corporate recruitment has been tapping into the networks of current employees for new talent. Now, a new trend is emerging, one that is shaking up this traditional approach while giving rise to an underground market where job seekers connect with anonymous company insiders willing to provide that coveted foot in the door. Why would an employee risk their reputation by participating in such a scheme? Simple. Bloomberg tells of one resourceful tech worker who, over the course of 18 months, managed to recommend more than a thousand job candidates to his employer, resulting in several successful hires and approximately $30,000 in referral bonuses. Nearly every person he endorsed was a complete stranger. It is easy to understand how this trend caught on. With job searches becoming increasingly prolonged and resumes seemingly disappearing into the void, applicants are seeking any advantage they can find. The power of a referral cannot be overstated. According to hiring platform Greenhouse, external applicants face a daunting 1 in 200 chance of being hired, while those with referrals see their odds improve significantly to 1 in 25. Internal applicants, though rare, enjoy the best odds at 1 in 5. Several platforms have emerged to facilitate these anonymous referrals. Blind, a free app used by millions of tech workers, hosts forums where job seekers can post about specific roles or companies. Verified employees can then offer to provide referrals, typically through direct messages. Glassdoor's referrals forum operates similarly, catering to finance and consulting roles in addition to tech. For those willing to pay, platforms like Refer Me and Refermarket offer more structured services. Refer Me charges $12 a month for unlimited referral requests, while Refermarket charges between $3 and $50 per request, depending on the user's plan. ReferralHub takes a different approach, allowing insiders to set their own prices. Current listings range from $10 for a ServiceNow referral to $50 for ByteDance, with companies like BlackRock, Goldman Sachs, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Spotify falling in the $20 to $25 range. The popularity of these services is evident, with Microsoft referrals on ReferralHub reportedly being sold over 200 times at $25 each. Refermarket, founded by a laid-off California tech worker in 2023, has amassed 10,000 users, with about a third opting for premium subscriptions. The platform's user base is about 60 percent based in India, with the remainder mainly based in the US. While these platforms claim their practices are legitimate and call them as "courtesy referrals," some companies disagree. Goldman Sachs explicitly stated that such unapproved referral activity violates their code of conduct. Google emphasized that referrals must be based on personal knowledge of candidates from immediate networks and are subject to the same vetting process as other applicants. Human resources professionals are taking notice. Jenny Dearborn, chief people strategy officer at BTS, recounted to Bloomberg how a previous employer simply began ignoring referrals from an employee who was submitting hundreds per quarter. Nolan Church, CEO of FairComp, warned that while job seekers have little to lose, employees risk damaging their most valuable asset: their reputation.

Assets managed by the New York-based company increased to $11.55 trillion from $10.01 trillion a year earlier and $11.48 trillion in the third quarter. Client assets were buoyed by a U.S. stock market rally after Donald Trump's presidential election victory in November, with investors betting on lower corporate taxes and deregulation. BlackRock's quarterly results complete a banner year for the asset manager, which has sought to strengthen its position in rapidly growing private markets, spending about $25 billion last year on infrastructure investment fund Global Infrastructure Partners and private credit business HPS Investment Partners. "For many companies, periods of M&A contribute to a pause in client engagement. At BlackRock, clients are instead embracing and rewarding our strategy," CEO Larry Fink said in a statement on Wednesday. Net income rose to $1.67 billion, or $10.63 per share, in the three months to Dec. 31 from $1.38 billion, or $9.15 per share, a year earlier. BlackRock registered $201 billion in long-term net inflows in the fourth quarter. Total net inflows hit $281.4 billion, up from $95.6 billion a year ago. A majority of the long-term inflows were captured by exchange-traded funds (ETFs), at $142.6 billion. Clients poured in $23.8 billion into BlackRock's fixed-income products. Assets under management mainly depend on two factors - the performance of investments, and money flowing in and out of the funds. The benchmark S&P 500 index gained 2.1% in the fourth quarter and finished the year up 23.3%, marking its second straight year of gains exceeding 20%. Elsewhere, the MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe fell 1.2% in the fourth quarter but finished up 15.7% in 2024, marking its second straight yearly gain. "Strong asset inflows this quarter contributed to a record-setting year for BLK," said Kyle Sanders, senior equity research analyst at Edward Jones. This, he said, "should boost investor confidence that the long-awaited great rotation, where investors move off the sidelines and start to 're-risk' by investing in equity and fixed income products, is beginning to materialize." Shares of the company were up 2% in premarket trading. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

By Davide Barbuscia NEW YORK (Reuters) -BlackRock posted a 21% fourth quarter jump in profit after buoyant equity markets increased income from fees and drove its assets to a record high of $11.6 trillion, the world's largest money manager said on Wednesday. Assets managed by the New York-based company increased to $11.55 trillion from $10.01 trillion a year earlier and $11.48 trillion in the third quarter. The growth was partly driven by a U.S. stock market rally after Donald Trump's presidential election victory in November prompted investors to bet on lower corporate taxes and deregulation. BlackRock (NYSE:BLK)'s quarterly results complete a banner year for the asset manager, which has sought to strengthen its position in rapidly growing private markets. It spent about $25 billion last year on infrastructure investment fund Global Infrastructure Partners and private credit business HPS Investment Partners. "For many companies, periods of M&A contribute to a pause in client engagement. At BlackRock, clients are instead embracing and rewarding our strategy," CEO Larry Fink said in a statement on Wednesday. Net income rose to $1.67 billion, or $10.63 per share, in the three months to Dec. 31 from $1.38 billion, or $9.15 per share, a year earlier. BlackRock registered $201 billion in long-term net inflows in the fourth quarter. Total (EPA:TTEF) net inflows hit $281.4 billion, up from $95.6 billion a year ago. A majority of the long-term inflows were captured by exchange-traded funds (ETFs), at $142.6 billion. Clients poured $23.8 billion into BlackRock's fixed-income products. The benchmark S&P 500 index gained 2.1% in the fourth quarter and finished the year up 23.3%, marking its second straight year of gains exceeding 20%. "Strong asset inflows this quarter contributed to a record-setting year for BLK," said Kyle Sanders, senior equity research analyst at Edward Jones. This, he said, "should boost investor confidence that the long-awaited great rotation, where investors move off the sidelines and start to 're-risk' by investing in equity and fixed income products, is beginning to materialize." Shares of the company were up nearly 4% at $1,000 in early trading on Wednesday. 'NOT FEELING ANY OLDER' BlackRock in June struck a $3.2 billion deal to acquire UK data provider Preqin as it seeks to offer indexes for private markets. Initially, BlackRock anticipated finalizing the Preqin deal by the end of 2024, but Britain's competition regulator last month launched a probe into the transaction and has set Feb. 12 as the deadline for a decision on the first leg of that review. BlackRock's Chief Financial Officer Martin Small said on Wednesday he now expected the deal to close in the first quarter of 2025, while the HPS deal should close within the first half. BlackRock's private markets buying spree may not be over, with the asset manager expected to opportunistically expand further in private credit, real estate, infrastructure, or possibly private equity, Reuters has reported. In a CNBC interview on Wednesday, though, Fink said it was unlikely the company would buy whole companies. Separately, and confirming earlier reports, Fink also said on Wednesday BlackRock senior executive Mark Wiedman, previously touted as a possible Fink successor, is leaving. Fink added many leaders were taking on new, expanded roles. Wiedman said in an email he would stay with the firm for the next few months and then work out his next move. Another executive, Salim Ramji, left BlackRock in January 2024 and went on to become the CEO of asset management company Vanguard Group. Ramji was also once touted as a potential successor to Fink, who is 72 years old. BlackRock's earnings call on Wednesday was Fink's 100th. "I can't say I feel any older," he said.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stock futures inched higher on Wednesday ahead of crucial consumer inflation data that could reset interest-rate bets, while investors waited to find out whether big bank earnings will live up to high hopes. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures (YM=F) rose roughly 0.2%, while S&P 500 futures (ES=F) nudged 0.1% higher. Contracts on the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F) added about 0.2%, on the heels of a mixed day on Wall Street. The markets are bracing for Wednesday's report on the consumer price index for December, seen as potential pivot point for stocks after wholesale inflation for the month came in cool. It will be a crucial test of whether an inflation resurgence is a risk to the US economy as investors debate the Federal Reserve's moves on interest rates in 2025.

They remain split on whether a cut will come in the back half of this year, with odds of easing in June hovering around 40%. The CPI report, due at 8:30 a.m. ET, is expected to show annual headline inflation at 2.9% and a monthly rate of 0.4%, up from November's levels. A strong reading could restart the selling in stocks and bonds that has marked the start of 2025. Meanwhile, investors are also waiting for quarterly reports from big Wall Street banks to kick off earnings season. JPMorgan Chase (JPM), the country’s largest bank, is expected to report that it notched its second straight year of record profits and show that earnings in the fourth quarter jumped. Updates from BlackRock (BLK), BNY (BK), Citi (C), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), and Wells Fargo (WFC) are also on the docket. Yours truly is getting ready to head out for another week of impactful reporting at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland — which kicks off next Monday. I will have more to say on what we will be doing there in this Sunday's Morning Brief newsletter. I will quickly note that a source familiar with the matter tells me President Trump will be speaking by video feed on Thursday, just days after his inauguration (and perhaps a flurry of executive orders). But ahead of that fun, I thought WEF's annual global risk report that dropped this morning is an interesting read. The top risk is "state-based armed conflict." Other top risks include misinformation and disinformation (good to see Zuck no longer fact-checking at Meta...), extreme weather events, societal polarization, cyber-espionage and warfare.

Title: The Right-Wing Judge on a Mission to Destroy ESG Retirement Planning
URL: https://newrepublic.com/article/190212/reed-oconnor-esg-investment-blackrock
Time Published: 2025-01-15T11:00:00Z
Full Content:
There are more than 800 federal judges in the United States. None of them create as much work for their colleagues as Reed O’Connor, a federal judge who serves in the northern district of Texas. For nearly two decades, O’Connor has delivered one ideologically driven ruling after another. No matter how many times those decisions are overturned by the appellate courts and the Supreme Court itself, he persists. In his latest haphazard ruling, O’Connor held last week that American Airlines violated its legal obligations to employees by allowing BlackRock, the company’s 401(k) manager, to consider “environmental, societal, and governance” factors when making investment decisions and casting proxy votes. If upheld on appeal, the ruling threatens to upend the entire retirement plan industry by opening 401(k) managers to litigation and penalties for using ESG factors as part of their investment strategies—something that nearly every manager has done in recent years. At issue in the case is whether the airline violated its legal obligations to employees by investing their 401(k) plans with BlackRock, one of the nation’s three largest investment managers, while the investment firm pursued environmentally and socially conscious goals. The class-action plaintiffs claimed that the airline financially harmed its 401(k) participants by not sufficiently scrutinizing BlackRock’s ESG principles when investing and casting proxy votes in shareholder meetings. BlackRock currently manages more than $10 trillion in retirement funds. Like nearly all such managers, it adopted a series of ESG policies over the last decade. Those policies led it to use its proxy voting powers on behalf of shareholders to encourage companies to adopt more socially and environmentally conscious policies. In perhaps the most famous episode, it sided with a group of activist investors in a 2021 proxy vote to put three members on ExxonMobil’s board who would push for investments in renewable energy. The plaintiffs claimed that this approach violated the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, also known as ERISA. The law sets basic standards for pensions and employee benefit and retirement plans offered by employers. Those employers have a fiduciary requirement to administer their plans on behalf of their employees to minimize risk, avoid conflicts of interest, and so on. Two of these obligations are known as the “duty of prudence” and the “duty of loyalty.” In the plaintiff’s telling, considering ESG issues when making investment decisions violates these duties because they inherently reduce the fund’s performance. “[American Airlines and its subsidiaries] have violated ERISA by selecting and retaining ESG funds that pursue nonfinancial or nonpecuniary objectives like ESG social policy objectives, rather than investment funds that have the exclusive purpose of maximizing financial returns for investors,” they argued in their complaint. American Airlines rejected that assertion and noted that it followed industry standards when offering investment products to employees via BlackRock and reviewing the managers’ actions, which it deemed to be prudent. It also denied that it acted disloyally to its employees by using BlackRock, even though it (and most other investment managers) is a shareholder in American Airlines itself, based on existing precedent. The airline further warned that adopting the plaintiffs’ approach could itself be illegal. “Acceptance of Plaintiff’s theory would compel ERISA fiduciaries to ignore actual investment performance and instead screen out investment options ‘based on non-pecuniary factors’ (i.e., the manager’s proxy voting record when the rationale for such votes is speculative at best), potentially harming participants by depriving them of access to some of the best performing, most popular, and highest rated funds in the market,” the company wrote. “Ironically, this is the exact practice that Plaintiff insists is forbidden by ERISA.” O’Connor ultimately accepted the plaintiffs’ assumption that ESG principles inherently reduced shareholder returns and sided with them. But he struggled to separate out ESG investing, which he found to be unlawful, with investment managers such as BlackRock considering environmental and social factors when deciding how to invest funds, which he found to be acceptable. “If the reason for investing in the company is because these social expenditures are viewed as reasonably reducing, for example, the material risk of government expropriation of the oil fields or mitigating against other types of impactful labor strife, this is not ESG investing because the focus is fundamentally fixed on maximizing a financial benefit,” O’Connor wrote as part of a hypothetical scenario. “But if the reason is due to the belief that the company has a responsibility to improve the society in which it operates notwithstanding the lack of or reduced economic benefit to the company,” the judge continued, “such a non-pecuniary consideration would qualify investments based on these social expenditures as a form of ESG investing.” Even accepting some of O’Connor’s assumptions, his reasoning would require litigants and judges to engage in some casual telepathy to determine a fund manager’s motives. Suppose, for example, BlackRock said that it would draw down its investments in oil and gas companies because of the risk that future climate-minded regulations would impact profits. Is that an unreasonable assumption? Or could it be attacked as a pretext to adopt ESG principles by other means? O’Connor complicated matters by only giving the plaintiffs half of what they wanted. While he ruled that American Airlines had violated its duty of loyalty by not spurning or challenging BlackRock for its ESG initiatives, he rejected the plaintiffs’ assertion that the company had violated the duty of prudence along the way. O’Connor complained that the airline had not acted imprudently when supervising employees’ retirement plans, namely by “selecting and retaining investment managers, overseeing proxy voting, and not intervening in the Exxon proxy vote.” He held that the plaintiffs had offered no evidence that the airline had gone against the industry’s best practices by continuing to rely on BlackRock, noting that no one else had removed the firm after the ExxonMobil vote, either. And while the plaintiffs pointed to the Texas legislature’s recent divestiture from BlackRock over its ESG policies, O’Connor admitted that the lawmakers’ moves, while “based on their sound view of the public interest,” weren’t bound by ERISA’s requirement to follow prevailing industry standards. The split ruling leads to a paradoxical result: In its telling, American Airlines violated ERISA by not challenging BlackRock’s ESG efforts in general and the ExxonMobil vote in particular, but would have also violated ERISA if it had imprudently dropped the management firm after the ExxonMobil vote. O’Connor tried to square the circle by describing the retirement plan industry as “oligopolist” and “cartel-like,” and claiming that “industry norms are not enough to safeguard against breaches of loyalty,” but the paradox remained. This mishmash of a ruling is par for the course with O’Connor. The judge became famous in the 2010s for habitually ruling that the Affordable Care Act was unconstitutional. In 2018, he ruled that the entire law was unconstitutional because a Republican-led Congress had zeroed out the individual mandate’s penalty. The decision was widely condemned as lawless, even by some of the ACA’s critics. In 2021, the Supreme Court nixed the lawsuit on standing grounds in a 7–2 ruling, with even Justice Clarence Thomas voting to uphold the ACA. More recently, O’Connor butchered the Indian Child Welfare Act through a series of profound misreadings of Indian law and precedent, again leading to a 7–2 reversal by the justices. O’Connor is also widely seen as an extremely friendly judge to conservative legal interests. Right-wing plaintiffs routinely file lawsuits in his division in hopes of getting them assigned to him. Elon Musk, the far-right CEO of X, updated the company’s terms of service last fall to require that any user lawsuit brought against X be filed in O’Connor’s division in Texas, even though the company is headquartered in California. It is unsurprising that the plaintiffs chose his court to file an anti-ESG lawsuit in, or that he might be interested in enforcing right-wing policy goals. Last December, for example, O’Connor threw out a proposed plea deal between the Justice Department and Boeing over its 737 MAX crashes because of a provision that would have required a federal monitor to be selected “in keeping with the [Justice] Department’s commitment to diversity and inclusion.” The judge claimed that “the parties’ DEI efforts only serve to undermine this confidence in the government and Boeing’s ethics and anti-fraud efforts.” The Supreme Court is already hearing two cases this term derived from O’Connor’s trial-court rulings. In one of them, Garland v. VanDerStok, the justices appeared poised to uphold a ghost-gun regulation that the judge had previously struck down. And the court agreed last week to review the lower court rulings in Becerra v. Braidwood Management Inc. In that case, O’Connor struck down an ACA mandate that required companies to provide coverage for preventative-care services, siding with a group of Texas employers who wanted to deny coverage for anti-HIV medications for their workers on religious grounds. If neither the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals nor the high court reverses O’Connor in the American Airlines case, it could potentially reshape how the 401(k) management industry considers risks when making investments in general, as well as severely damage ESG efforts in particular. More litigation will follow, as well as potential financial hits to major American companies themselves—O’Connor has yet to rule on the penalty for American Airlines in this case. It is usually hard to predict whether the Supreme Court will take up a particular case at this stage in the proceedings. With O’Connor, however, we can assume that the court’s intervention is more likely than not. Matt Ford is a staff writer at The New Republic.

Title: US stock futures drift higher ahead of CPI release, bank earnings on tap

Investing.com -- The S&P 500 closed sharply higher Wednesday as cooling inflation and strong quarterly earnings from Wall Street banks stoked bullish sentiment on stocks. At 4:00 p.m. ET (21:00 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 703 points, or 1.7%, the S&P 500 index added 1.8%, and the NASDAQ Composite climbed 2.5%. Sentiment has been boosted Wednesday after data showed the headline consumer price index increased by 0.4% month-on-month in December, slightly faster than a pace of 0.3% in the prior month. Compared to a year earlier, CPI gained 2.9%, up from 2.7% in November. However, the surprise came with the so-called “core” figure, which strips out volatile components like fuel and food. This rose 0.2% on a monthly basis and 3.2% year-on-year, below expectations for 0.3% and 3.3%, respectively. Still, some on Wall Street continue to see risks for inflation and reiterate expectations for just one cut this year. "Our baseline remains for just one further 25 bps cut from the FOMC, with the most likely timing being March or May. Risks remain skewed to a later date," Macquarie said in a note. Heading into the report, concerns had been swirled around nagging inflation, particularly after last week’s blockbuster employment data. President-elect Donald Trump’s plans to impose strict tariffs on allies and adversaries alike have also fueled the worries around price pressures. Markets are positioning for a much slower pace of interest rate cuts in 2025, with the Federal Reserve forecasting just two rate cuts - a trend that could bode poorly for risk-driven assets. There had been fears before this release that the Fed may actually be forced by sticky inflation to raise rates this year. In the corporate sector, a number of major banks impressed with their latest quarterly returns on Wednesday, offering a boost to the waning post-election stock market rally. JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) stock rose 2% after the investment banking giant posted record annual profit as its dealmakers and traders reaped a windfall from rebounding markets in the fourth quarter. The Wall Street bank also touted increased share buybacks. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) stock soared 6% after the investment bank’s profit more than doubled in the fourth quarter, driven by strong reading results. Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) stock gained nearly 7% after the lender reported better-than-expected results in the fourth quarter, buoyed by stronger investment banking earnings. BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK), meanwhile, climbed 5% after reporting a beat on both the top and bottom lines as its assets hit a record high in Q4. Beacon Roofing Supply Inc (NASDAQ:BECN) rose more than 7% after the building products distributor said QXO had made an deal worth $11 billion to buy the company. President Joe Biden confirmed Wednesday that Israel and Hamas reached ceasefire and hostage deal to end 15 months of war on the Gaza strip. (Ambar Warrick contributed to this article.)

Title: Futures muted with CPI, bank earnings ahead - what's moving markets
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/futures-muted-with-cpi-bank-earnings-ahead--whats-moving-markets-3813384

Investing.com - US stock futures are steady ahead of the publication of a crucial US inflation report and the release of quarterly earnings from several banking giants. Economists predict that a gauge of consumer price growth that could play into the outlook for Federal Reserve monetary policy accelerated slightly in December. Meanwhile, with a post-election stock market surge possibly easing, investors are looking to the results from JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and other lenders to help reignite the rally. 1. Futures steady US stock futures hovered around the flatline on Wednesday, as investors prepared for the release of key US inflation data and a slew of earnings from major Wall Street lenders. By 03:29 ET (08:29 GMT), the Dow futures contract, S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures were mostly unchanged. The main averages logged a mixed close following a choppy session on Tuesday, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite slipping and the 30-stock Dow Jones Industrial Average and benchmark S&P 500 ending higher. A softer-than-expected reading of US producer price growth fueled an initial rise in equities, but the report was not enough to materially impact the outlook for the Federal Reserve's interest rate path. Traders were paying particularly close attention to a jump in airfare prices, which contribute to a crucial measure of inflation favored by Fed rate-setters. 2. CPI ahead Attention now turns to the release of a gauge of consumer prices, which could provide further clarity around the state of inflation. Economists estimate that the headline consumer price index increased by 0.4% month-on-month in December, slightly faster than a pace of 0.3% in the prior month. Compared to a year earlier, CPI is seen at 2.9%, up from 2.7% in November. Stripping out items like food and fuel, the so-called “core” figure is projected to come in at 0.3% on a monthly basis and 3.3% year-on-year, matching November. Heading into the report, concerns have swirled around nagging inflation, particularly after last week’s blockbuster employment data. President-elect Donald Trump’s plans to impose strict tariffs on allies and adversaries alike have also fueled the worries around price pressures. US government bond yields have touched multi-month highs in recent days, weighing on the attractiveness of stocks, as investors have dialed back bets that the Fed will roll out interest rate cuts this year. The central bank slashed borrowing costs by a full percentage point in 2024. While bond investors may have been encouraged by the soft producer prices print, some analysts have flagged that even a CPI number in line with forecasts may not be enough to stem the bearish sentiment. 3. Bank earnings Several major lenders are due to report their latest quarterly returns on Wednesday, with investors eyeing them as a potential source of life for a waning post-election stock market rally. JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, and Citigroup (NYSE:C), as well as asset management giant BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), are set to announce their numbers prior to the opening bell on Wednesday. Investment banking and trading revenues will likely be a focal point, especially following a surge in stocks after Trump's election victory that was fueled by hopes on Wall Street for a new era of looser regulations and lower taxes. A dip in corporate borrowing costs could buoy top-line results as well. Analysts have also predicted that the Fed's rate cuts may have bolstered net interest margins, or the difference between what a lender pays out for deposits and makes from borrowing. 4. US to push TSMC, Samsung to tighten China chip supplies - Bloomberg The US is planning more regulations aimed at limiting the flow of advanced chips made by TSMC and its peers into China, Bloomberg News reported on Wednesday, adding to a flurry of restrictions imposed by the Biden administration. The proposed measures will encourage manufacturers such as TSMC (TW:2330), Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (KS:005930), and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) to more carefully scrutinize their customers for ties to blacklisted Chinese organizations, Bloomberg said. The report comes just days after the US introduced additional restrictions on the export of cutting-edge artificial intelligence chips, in a continued effort to cut China off from advances in the fast-growing technology. 5. Crude gains Oil prices advanced Wednesday, helped by a drop in US crude stockpiles as well as fears that new sanctions on Russian oil exports will disrupt global supplies. By 03:30 ET, the US crude futures (WTI) rose by 0.5% to $76.75 a barrel, while the Brent contract added 0.4% to $80.27 per barrel. Prices slipped on Tuesday after the US Energy Information Administration predicted oil would come under pressure over the next two years as supply would outpace demand. That said, the market has found some support from a report from the American Petroleum Institute late Tuesday that showed a decline in crude stockpiles in the US, the world's biggest oil consumer. Traders also continue to focus on the Russian oil sanctions, amid uncertainty around how much Russian supply will be lost in the global market and whether alternative measures can offset the shortfall.

Global elites suggest declining populations could accelerate AI and robotics adoption, offering economic advantages by replacing human labor with machines, particularly in developed nations. Critics warn of deepening global inequality, as nations with strong infrastructure and education may thrive in an automated economy, while others risk being left behind. AI and robotics are rapidly replacing both white-collar and blue-collar jobs, with no profession immune, raising alarms about widespread unemployment and societal disruption. Individuals must elevate their roles to stay relevant, as automation reshapes the workforce, with those unable to adapt potentially marginalized in a depopulated future. The debate centers on whether technological advancement should take precedence over preserving human labor, with fears of a dystopian future where inequality and joblessness escalate.

The debate centers on whether technological advancement should take precedence over preserving human labor, with fears of a dystopian future where inequality and joblessness escalate. In a startling revelation that has sparked widespread debate, global elites are openly discussing the potential benefits of depopulation as a catalyst for the rapid adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics. This controversial perspective, highlighted in a recent Brighteon Broadcast News segment by Mike Adams, suggests that countries with declining populations may have a strategic advantage in transitioning to an automated workforce. However, the ethical and social implications of this shift are raising alarms among critics, who warn of a deepening global divide between nations equipped to embrace automation and those left behind. The conversation was ignited by comments from a BlackRock executive, who argued that shrinking populations in developed countries could accelerate the replacement of human labor with machines. "Countries that have shrinking demographics will rapidly develop robotics and AI technology," the executive stated. "If the promise of these technologies transforms productivity, as most of us believe it will, it could elevate the standard of living even with declining populations." This perspective challenges the traditional view that population decline is inherently negative, instead framing it as an opportunity for economic transformation. The executive further explained that nations with restrictive immigration policies and declining birth rates would find it easier to substitute human workers with machines, avoiding the social complexities of integrating a growing labor force. "The paradigm of negative population growth is going to change," he asserted. "The social problems of replacing humans with machines will be far easier in countries with declining populations." However, this optimistic outlook is not without its critics. Opponents argue that this vision of the future risks exacerbating global inequality. Countries with robust education systems, infrastructure, and rule of law may thrive in an automated economy, while those lacking these foundations could be left further behind. "For countries with rising populations, the answer will be education and rapid development," the executive acknowledged. "But for those without a foundation of rule of law or education, they're going to be left. That's where the divide is going to get more pronounced." The debate underscores a broader ethical dilemma: should humanity prioritize technological advancement over the preservation of human labor? As AI and robotics continue to advance, the potential for job displacement across industries is becoming increasingly apparent. Mike Adams, in his broadcast, emphasized that no profession is immune. "Much of humanity is being replaced by AI systems," he warned. "AI software is replacing white-collar jobs, and AI robots are replacing blue-collar jobs, including in agriculture." Adams recounted conversations with individuals in creative fields, such as graphic design, journalism, and law, who remain skeptical about the threat of automation. "They don't get it," he said. "They describe their job processes, and I tell them, 'You just described exactly what an AI agent can do right now.'" He pointed to the rapid evolution of AI tools, which can now perform tasks like photo editing, video production, and even creative writing with minimal human input. "It's not a question of if AI will make your job obsolete," Adams asserted. "The answer for almost everybody is yes, it will." The implications of this shift are profound. As automation reshapes the workforce, individuals and societies must grapple with how to adapt. Adams urged listeners to consider how they can elevate their roles to stay relevant in an AI-driven world. "The real question is how you can position yourself to stay on top of AI automation," he said. "Otherwise, you risk being thrown into the depopulation category, which is what the globalists are doing." This provocative discussion raises critical questions about the future of work, economic equity, and the role of humanity in an increasingly automated world. While some see depopulation and automation as a pathway to prosperity, others fear it could lead to a dystopian future where human labor is rendered obsolete and global inequality reaches unprecedented levels. As the debate continues, one thing is clear: the choices made today will shape the trajectory of societies for generations to come.

"Much of humanity is being replaced by AI systems," he warned. "AI software is replacing white-collar jobs, and AI robots are replacing blue-collar jobs, including in agriculture." Adams recounted conversations with individuals in creative fields, such as graphic design, journalism, and law, who remain skeptical about the threat of automation. "They don't get it," he said. "They describe their job processes, and I tell them, 'You just described exactly what an AI agent can do right now.'" He pointed to the rapid evolution of AI tools, which can now perform tasks like photo editing, video production, and even creative writing with minimal human input. "It's not a question of if AI will make your job obsolete," Adams asserted. "The answer for almost everybody is yes, it will." The implications of this shift are profound. As automation reshapes the workforce, individuals and societies must grapple with how to adapt. Adams urged listeners to consider how they can elevate their roles to stay relevant in an AI-driven world. "The real question is how you can position yourself to stay on top of AI automation," he said. "Otherwise, you risk being thrown into the depopulation category, which is what the globalists are doing." This provocative discussion raises critical questions about the future of work, economic equity, and the role of humanity in an increasingly automated world. While some see depopulation and automation as a pathway to prosperity, others fear it could lead to a dystopian future where human labor is rendered obsolete and global inequality reaches unprecedented levels. As the debate continues, one thing is clear: the choices made today will shape the trajectory of societies for generations to come.

Sources include: Brighteon.com Triplepundit.com TheShib The executive further explained that nations with restrictive immigration policies and declining birth rates would find it easier to substitute human workers with machines, avoiding the social complexities of integrating a growing labor force. "The paradigm of negative population growth is going to change," he asserted. "The social problems of replacing humans with machines will be far easier in countries with declining populations." However, this optimistic outlook is not without its critics. Opponents argue that this vision of the future risks exacerbating global inequality. Countries with robust education systems, infrastructure, and rule of law may thrive in an automated economy, while those lacking these foundations could be left further behind. "For countries with rising populations, the answer will be education and rapid development," the executive acknowledged. "But for those without a foundation of rule of law or education, they're going to be left. That's where the divide is going to get more pronounced."

Title: Eyes on the prize with history to be made by two of the four clubs in novel All-Ireland finale
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/gaelic-games/2025/01/15/eyes-on-the-prize-with-history-to-be-made-by-two-of-the-four-clubs-in-novel-all-ireland-finale/
Time Published: 2025-01-15T06:00:00Z
Full Content:
For a change, next Sunday’s All-Ireland club finals bring a high degree of novelty. The championship has been through many changes, particularly in more recent years, but the trend towards serial success has at least temporarily come to a halt. Pre-pandemic, Corofin became in 2020 the first club to win three successive All-Irelands and, but for the pandemic, Ballyhale Shamrocks might well have emulated them in the abandoned year that followed, in 2021. This weekend, for the first time in 32 years, all four clubs are appearing at this stage for the first time. You could argue that both the Cuala footballers and Na Fianna hurlers are simply following in the footsteps of the “other code” within their clubs. The Dalkey team won back-to-back All-Ireland hurling titles in 2017 and 2018, whereas Na Fianna were football finalists in 2000. To hold that against the current teams would be nit-picking, as they will be representing the historically less-fashionable side of their respective houses. Cuala’s defeat of Kilmacud in the county final was their first football title, just as Na Fianna, who skinned the same opponents with a dying-seconds goal in their final, were collecting only a second Dublin hurling championship. Their respective opponents in Croke Park, Errigal Ciarán and Sarsfields, are uncomplicatedly first-timers. Errigal are actually Tyrone’s first contestants in the senior club final, maybe surprisingly given their success at intercounty level in the past two decades as well as the strike rate of their junior and intermediate clubs – 11 finals and four titles – at national level in the same time frame. Sarsfields didn’t even emerge from Cork as champions, having lost comprehensively to Imokilly in the final. But their opponents’ status as a divisional side – barred from provincial competition – cleared the way for them to contest Munster. Their performances stunned observers, especially in the final when they burned off regular champions Ballygunner in the early stages and maintained the heat as the match progressed. A Cork side had reached the Munster final just once in the previous 14 years and you had to go back a further seven seasons for the once-dominant county’s most recent title, Newtownshandrum in 2009. It had been eight seasons since a club from the county had even won a single match in Munster. Theirs has been a story of triumph in adversity and not just on the field. In 2023, Storm Babet brought floods that destroyed their pitch in Riverstown. For a year they had to couch-surf in neighbouring clubs, their facilities restored only a few months ago. [ Con O’Callaghan inspires Cuala to reach Croke Park deciderOpens in new window ] Should Cuala win on Sunday, they will become only the second club after St Finbarr’s to have lifted both All-Ireland trophies. Their success has been seen as the gauge of Dublin GAA’s reach into the southside suburbs in the 50 years since Kevin Heffernan revived the county as an All-Ireland force. On the eve of a first four-in-a-row in 2018, former captain and manager Tony Hanahoe made the point. “Now that Dublin have arrived and are there, there are two or three generations who won’t ever understand how far down we had gone at that stage. For one who remembers these things, the rise in the interest in the game and the success rate has been astounding. “The greatest example of that is Cuala. If, 30 or 40 years ago, you had attempted to convince me that there would be an All-Ireland winning club from out around Killiney, I’d have laughed in your face.” Na Fianna are based in more traditional territory but both come into the “super club” category, with 3,000 or more members – a reflection on how hard it is to establish a club in Dublin, which fosters outsize catchments. [ Na Fianna of Dublin and Sarsfields of Cork secure first All-Ireland club hurling final appearanceOpens in new window ] The county could become the third to win both club All-Irelands in the same year, following Cork in 1973 (Glen Rovers and Nemo Rangers) and 1979 (Blackrock and Nemo) and Galway in 2006 (Salthill and Portumna). Pride of place in the history of dual All-Ireland challenges has to go, however, to Cork’s St Finbarr’s, who in 1981 reached both finals, beating Walterstown in the football but losing the hurling to Ballyhale. It is now five years since the traditional St Patrick’s Day date went by the board for the club finals. For all the grumbling about how this calendar switch to January has undermined attendances, there were signs that the public were losing interest in the regular March fixture. Fewer than 18,000 attended in the last year of the Patrick’s Day finals and 12 months previously – not helped by arctic weather and Ireland’s rugby Grand Slam decider with England being on television at the same time – just 15,000 made their way down Jones’s Road. It was a far cry from peak crowds at the turn of the century. In 1999 for the Crossmaglen v Ballina and St Joseph’s Doora-Barefield v Rathnure double bill, a record 40,106 turned up. But with the exception of 2004′s Caltra v An Gaeltacht and Newtownshandrum v Dunloy pairing, which drew 38,500, attendances settled in the low 30,000s. The new split season has created pressures for top intercounty players, obliged to go around the clock if their clubs do well. Christmas has always been affected in successful clubs, making a calendar year attractive but, in the consensus view, impractical. On the Irish Independent sports podcast, Birr’s Michael Verney – for all of us, that most dignifying combination of All-Ireland finalist and reporter – gave the hardship argument short shrift. “You hear, isn’t it terrible that players are missing out on Christmas. I can tell you that the players who have to – in inverted commas – ‘sacrifice’ Christmas are the envy of every other club in the country. That is a fact.” By Sunday evening, that process will intensify as two of the weekend’s clubs create history. sean.moran@irishtimes.com Latest news from the world of sport, along with the best in opinion from our outstanding team of sports writers © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Head coach Neil Doak poses for a portrait during the Ireland U-20 squad announcement at PwC HQ in Spencer Dock, Dublin. Photo: Ben McShane/Sportsfile Neil Doak Ireland U-20 head coach Neil Doak has vowed to play rugby that “excites players and spectators” after he named his squad for the Six Nations today. Doak (right), who is coaching his first Six Nations, aims to build on Ireland’s extraordinary run in the competition after back-to-back Grand Slams followed by a second-place finish last year – despite winning four games and drawing one against England, losing out on bonus points. “Ultimately as a coach you have to understand the players. There is no point asking players to do things that they’re not really comfortable with and so we’ll adjust as we go along,” he said. "We'll obviously look at the other teams and see where we can exploit some avenues but from my point of view, I want to play a brand of rugby that excites the players and excites spectators. “We also know that we want to be successful as well. And what we’re got to try and do as coaching staff and as management is help the players be really good problem solvers, give them scenarios, give them a framework that they can sort build things off, make good decisions.” Ireland host England in Cork on Thursday, January 30 and Doak is not worried about the short turnaround, with just over two weeks until the opening game. “It's a short window to try and prepare a team and put it together, so there’s a decent bit of work that has to go into it beforehand. Hugely positive win against Italy pre-Christmas and played Leinster [development XV] last Saturday. "The boys did well with the chopping and changing, which is always difficult and trying to get those combinations and sort of get everybody on the same page, but the players have done very well over the three camps. "I think in the Italy game we scored two or three tries in a short window which took us away from them, but I was hugely impressed with the way that the second-half team in the Leinster development match, dealt with it. “Difficult conditions, a bit of drizzle, it wasn’t as fluid as we had hoped it would be and I thought we showed great character, got into the right areas of the field and we delivered a few times and sort of just kept us in front. It stands us in good stead, especially the back end of the games, that we can deliver points. I was hugely pleased with that 40-minutes.” Connacht academy player Éanna McCarthy was named captain and the Cork-born back-row, along with five returning players from last year’s competition, gives Doak a great leadership group for the tournament. “When we put the squad together and the management together, and tried to build what we were about, for me I’m a bit more action-orientated. I want to get in the middle. "Last week, Éanna was physical, he was direct and we’re going to need that in abundance against England first up. If he can lead from the front, we can get the rest of the squad in behind him and we’ll be in a good spot. “I think if you look at the England squad, I think they’ve maybe nine or 10 back from that World Cup winning squad. For us, that exposure and experience, I think that was good leading into the World Cup last year. "The returning players were able to sit in front of the rest of the squad and just give them an insight of what South Africa was going to be like. How intense it is, game after game after game after game. That experience stood us in good stead. "I think the returning players, they will be key parts to the squad and the success of the squad. Because the younger guys coming in can bounce things off them and get a better understanding of what it is all about.” Ireland U-20 Squad Forwards (17): Billy Bohan (Galway Corinthians RFC/Connacht); Billy Corrigan (Old Wesley RFC/Leinster); Michael Foy (UCC RFC/Munster); Conor Kennelly (Highfield RFC/Munster); Connor Magee (Banbridge RFC/Ulster); Tom McAllister (Ballynahinch RFC/Ulster); Éanna McCarthy (Galwegians RFC/Connacht) (capt); Alex Mullan (Blackrock College RFC/Leinster); Aaron O’Brien (St Mary’s College RFC/Leinster); Bobby Power (Galwegians RFC/Connacht); Mahon Ronan (Old Wesley RFC/Leinster); Alan Spicer (UCD RFC/Leinster); Alex Usanov (Clontarf FC/Leinster); Henry Walker (Queen’s University Belfast RFC/Ulster); David Walsh (Terenure College RFC/Leinster); Adam Watchorn (Old Wesley RFC/Leinster); Mikey Yarr (UCD RFC/Leinster) Backs (14): Andrew Doyle (Old Wesley RFC/Leinster); Connor Fahy (Clontarf FC/Leinster); Paidi Farrell (Old Wesley RFC/Leinster); Daniel Green (Queen’s University Belfast RFC/Ulster); Dylan Hicks (Garryowen FC/Munster); Gene O’Leary Kareem (UCC RFC/Munster); Clark Logan (Queen’s University Belfast RFC/Ulster); Ciarán Mangan (Blackrock College RFC/Leinster); Derry Moloney (Blackrock College RFC/Leinster); Charlie Molony (UCD RFC/Leinster); Andre Ryan (Old Belvedere RFC/Leinster); Eoghan Smyth (Cork Constitution FC/Munster); Sam Wisniewski (Old Belvedere RFC/Leinster); Will Wootton (Sale Sharks/IQ Rugby)

Students used the University of Otago's Bloomberg terminals to research stocks to invest in. Photo / Alex Robertson A trio of finance students at the University of Otago’s Business School technically made a profit of $101,110 from virtual share trading over a five-week period as part of a global competition. Shenjian Li, Mingxuan Yu and Junxiu Lyu invested $1 million of imaginary capital into 55 United States and Canadian listed companies, including BlackRock, Trump Media and Technology Group and an array of finance, technology, commodity and pharmaceutical-related companies. They followed an earnings-based investment strategy, holding no more than five stocks at a time and selling them for a gain or loss after those companies released their financial reports. The total payoff was equal to an annualised return of about 162%, putting them in the top 11% of the Bloomberg market trading challenge in which they competed against more than 2000 teams from universities across 46 countries. “It’s the sort of [investment] performance that professional hedge fund managers would like to obtain in their funds,” Otago Professor Emeritus of finance Timothy Falcon Crack said. The students used the University of Otago’s Bloomberg terminals to research their investments through company earnings reports, financial analyst reports and news articles. “Even though it wasn’t real money, we still had to make decisions based on real-world data and could only buy and sell stocks in the Bloomberg Lab,” student Junxiu Lyu said. Their investment returns dropped 10% in the second week of the challenge but they still held their stock positions. “Sometimes I’d wake up in the middle of the night to check [our investments], and one day I saw 15% losses,” student Shenjian Li said. They were the only New Zealand team to enter the competition and beat all the Australian teams. The team, called Otago Alpha, placed 262nd overall among 2453 teams from 383 universities. They were mentored by senior finance lecturer Dr Olena Onishchenko. Plus: The hottest stocks investors are buying.

The rupee extended its recovery for the second straight session and settled with a gain of 13 paise at 86.40 (provisional) against the US dollar on Wednesday, tracking favourable cues from domestic equity markets and softening crude oil prices. - PTI WhatsApp Image 2025-01-15 at 15.38.55.jpeg According to Motilal Oswal Private Wealth (MOPW), Indian markets are expected to remain volatile in the first half of 2025 due to several global and domestic events, including the new Trump administration’s policies, China’s measures to counter trade tariffs and its possible implications for EM currencies, and the upcoming Indian Union budget. These events are anticipated to create uncertainty in the near term. However, as these events unfold and greater clarity emerges, market volatility is expected to subside in the latter half of the year. Despite the recent slowdown in GDP, MOPW remains optimistic about India’s growth due to its macroeconomic stability, supported by significant foreign exchange reserves and a regulated twin deficit. It expects GDP growth to improve compared to the modest growth reported in Q2 FY25. Ashish Shanker, MD & CEO of MOPW says, “The post covid period has been extremely rewarding to equity investors driven by earnings growth, improving macros and domestic inflows into equities. The year 2024 has been no different with broader markets doing extremely well. The mid cap and small cap segment have outperformed the large caps. Gold has also done well as an asset class. The year 2025 will bring its share of uncertainty as the new US president gets sworn in. After years of good performance the US markets also looks tired. This calls for moderation in expectations and a sharp focus on risk management through asset allocation” After tepid corporate earnings and slow GDP growth in Q2FY25, MOPW recommends closely monitoring the upcoming earnings season and GDP growth trajectory.. We expect this trend to reverse and expect large caps to do better this year given the valuation comfort. In the longer term, earning growth and stock returns should converge. Considering this, it seems small cap stocks have run up way ahead of earnings growth in most of the segments. MOPW expects this trend to reverse and large caps to do better this year given the valuation comfort.

US producer prices rose at a slower-than-anticipated rate in December, increasing by 0.2% on a month-on-month basis, below 0.4% pace seen in November. Sticky inflation and strength in the labor market could provide the Federal Reserve more headroom to keep interest rates high. Trump’s team is preparing a plan for a gradual imposition of trade tariffs in the coming months, although it was unclear whether the President-elect will follow through on the plan. The plan will involve tariff increases of between 2% to 5% every month, and will give Washington more leverage in trade negotiations, while also preventing a sudden spike in inflation due to the duties. Despite lower PPi, dollar index continues to hold its strength hovering around its two year highs, market participants will keep an eye on the US CPI data scheduled later today. Updates regarding a ceasefire deal yesterday between Israel and Hamas capped some gains for precious metal, any further updates on the same could weigh on prices. Perspective by Ravi Hirwani, Senior Vice-President, Bhailal Amin General Hospital, Vadodara, on expectations from the upcoming Union Budget “The Indian healthcare sector is at a pivotal junction of growth. Certain measures announced by the government can further amplify it. The ecosystem needs to be re-engineered to empower rural counterparts with robust, tech-forward healthcare and medical solutions. Complex ailments like cancer and heart issues burden the ecosystem. There is a shortage of medical specialists, and the need for healthcare infrastructure development in the country’s rural counterpart. The sector needs strategic reforms from both operational and financial perspectives. We request the honorable Finance Minister to increase the allocation by 3% spending of the total GDP to the healthcare sector. Further, the removal or reduction of customs duties on medical devices and cancer-related drugs & devices. The government must consider giving the healthcare sector an infrastructure status that will help private players to reap the benefit and expand operations, especially in smaller cities. An incentivization scheme for expansion in Tier-2 and below cities and the adoption of technology will help the sector flourish in the long run. Hospitals must be allowed to avail the benefits of input tax credit that will help bring a control on treatment costs effectively, thus creating a win-win situation for both industry players and residents alike. The country must aim for dual-dimensional growth by catering for the residents as well as foreign nationals and to address this, we request the government to introduce special packages and measures for foreign nationals seeking to take treatment in India. This will further accentuate the positioning of India as one of the most sought-after destinations for medical tourism.” Smartlink Holdings Ltd has informed the exchange about sanction of the amalgamation scheme between Smartlink Holdings and Synegra EMS Ltd by the National Company Law Tribunal.

WhatsApp Image 2025-01-15 at 9.33.07 AM.jpeg The Nifty’s bounce yesterday has created a “bullish harami” formation given the Monday drop which is similar to what was seen on January 7 and means that bulls have to push the index through 23340 for a larger advance. The 17th to 23rd January time window is nearing, so support in the 22830 - 23000 area and resistance in the 23355 - 23470 zone will be watched closely. While our prop oscillators on the daily and the weekly continue to be bearish, the former has now entered oversold territory. Any extension of yesterday’s rebound needs to hold the Monday low of 23047.

The European Union is set to propose a ban on Russian primary aluminium imports in its 16th sanctions package, marking the third anniversary of the Ukraine war. This measure follows reduced Russian aluminium imports, which fell to 6% of total EU aluminium demand in 2024. While U.S. and UK bans have intensified the supply shift, the EU seeks alternatives from Middle Eastern producers like the UAE and Bahrain. The news initially pushed LME aluminium prices to a one-month high of $2,602 before settling at $2,576.50, reflecting market uncertainties. * AARTIIND * ANGELONE * BANDHANBANK * HINDCOPPER * LTFIN * RBLBANK Optiemus: Company partners Taiwan-based KunWay Technology to Drive Drone Manufacturing Localization in India.

In the US, Producer prices increased 0.2% mom (+3.3% YoY) in Dec-24, below 0.4% in November which was the biggest gain in five months, and compared to forecasts of 0.3% (+3.4% YoY). Meanwhile, the core PPI was unchanged, following a 0.2% rise (+3.5%YoY) in Nov and compared to forecasts of 0.3% (+3.8%YoY). On the fiscal front in the U.S. government posted an $87 billion budget deficit in December, reduced partly by a shift of benefit payments into November but capping a record $711 billion deficit for the first three months of the 2025 fiscal year, On the domestic front, India’s wholesale prices increased by 2.37% yoy in December 2024, accelerating from a 1.89% rise in November, slightly above forecasts of a 2.30% gain. This was due to faster rises in manufacturing prices amid a softer fall in fuel prices. Primary articles saw faster growth (6.02% vs 5.49% in Nov), and manufacturing prices accelerated to a 23-month high (2.14% vs 2.00%). In view of ongoing political crisis in Bangladesh, India aims to boost its textile and garments industry in next month’s budget with financial support, tariff cuts on key inputs and incentives to produce locally, two government sources said. The government may also raise the allocation for production-linked incentives for the textile sector to around 600 million rupees from 450 million rupees for the current fiscal year, the source said. Moreover the government is likely to forecast nominal economic growth of 10.3 per cent-10.5 per cent, according to one of the officials. That’s higher than the forecast of 9.7 per cent for the current year to end-March given by the government’s statistical department this month.

The IPO that comes out with a price band of ₹407-428 a share saw a tremendous response from non-institutional investors including retail by subscribing 16 times. The minimum lot size is 33 shares. Equity markets are expected to sustain their gains at open. Gift Nifty at 23,310 signals a marginal gain of about 50 points at open. However, analysts expect the market to remain volatile and remain under pressure given the unabated selling by foreign portfolio investors. Siddhartha Khemka, Head - Research, Wealth Management, Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd, said: positive domestic factors include a decline in retail inflation to a four-month low of 5.2 per cent, IIP growth improving in November 2024 to 5.17 per cent and the RBI Governor’s indication of a more flexible rupee policy, contributing to improved market sentiment. “While there is short-term relief in the market, overall weak global cues, a fall in the rupee, low earnings growth and FII outflows continue to weigh on sentiment, keeping the overall outlook cautious,” he added. Read more The last month of the year 2024 was quite eventful even though Indian bond yields continued to trade in a narrow range. INR was the centre of attention as it come under increasing pressure in the latter part of December on back of continuous rise in the dollar index as it surged 2.60% during the month. INR depreciated by 1.32% against the US dollar, touching a lifetime low of 85.82 on an intraday basis before a marginal pullback on RBI intervention led to monthly and yearly closing at 85.61. The dollar index climbed above 108, ending the month at 108.49. December started on an optimistic note for the bond markets as markets started to factor in a higher probability of a policy rate cut in the December 6th Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting after the much slower-than-expected Q2 FY25 GDP growth data released on 29th Nov 2024. The MPC kept all the policy rates on hold while RBI reduced the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) by 50bps. The reduction in CRR released Rs. 1.16 lac cr of liquidity in the banking system, which was struggling with tight liquidity on account of heavy RBI intervention in the FX markets along with advance tax and GST outflows. The MPC decision’s to hold policy rates was taken with a 4-2 majority with Dr. Nagesh Kumar and Professor Ram Singh voting for a 25bps cut in the policy repo rate. The monetary policy stance of “Neutral” was retained unanimously. The MPC revised both its Inflation and Growth forecast for FY25, pegging down the GDP forecast at 6.60% from 7.20% earlier and increasing the Inflation forecast to 4.80% for FY25 from 4.50% earlier. RBI remains optimistic on GDP growth in H2FY25 after the negative surprise of Q2. The tone of the policy was balanced with emphasis on durable price stability. There was change of guard at the RBI as Sanjay Malhotra, the incumbent revenue secretary took over as the 26th Governor of RBI replacing Shaktikanta Das who was at the helm for six years. CPI Inflation came in line with expectations at 5.48% with core inflation remaining stead at 3.70%. Food Inflation moderated but remained high at 8.2% YOY. WPI Inflation cooled to 1.90% in November compared to 2.40% in October led by moderation in food prices. WPI has averaged 2.10% so far in this fiscal, compared to a corresponding period average of -1.30% in FY2023. WPI “core” Inflation came in at 0.50% compared to 0.30% in October, though remined below 1% for the fourth consecutive month. Trade deficit hit an all-time high of USD 37.9 bn for November as imports led by gold imports hitting an all-time high of USD 70 bn. Couple of days after the release of the trade data , there were news reports of some error in the data and the government thinking about setting up a team to double check on the data. The current account deficit came in steady at 1.20% of GDP for QE September 24, compared to 1.10% of GDP in the quarter ending June 24. Capital account remained in surplus at USD 30 bn and the overall BOP surplus came in at USD 18.60 bn in QE September from USD 5.20 bn in the previous quarter. The current account deficit is likely to expand in the December quarter. Tax collections remains robust with the third quarter advance tax payment at Rs 3.15 lakh crore, compared with Rs 2.7 lakh crore a year ago. Net direct tax collections (net of refunds) rose 16.45% YOY to INR 15.82 lac crore, which consisted of INR 7.42 lac crore of corporate tax and INR 7.97 lac crore of non-corporate tax collection with STT collections at INR 40,000 crore. The finance ministry, in its economic review for November, expressed optimism regarding a growth rebound in H2 of FY25 by projecting a GDP growth of 6.50% for FY25. The report also mentioned that the “combination of monetary policy stance and macroprudential measures by the central bank may have contributed to the demand slowdown”. This is being seen as putting some pressure on RBI to support growth by reducing rates. Interbank liquidity remained pretty tight even after the reduction in CRR, leading to sharp uptick in money market yields of up to 1 Yr maturity. 3 month maturity CD yields were trading close to 7.40%-7.45% levels, higher by 20-25 bps, compared to the September quarter and the 1 Yr maturity CD’s were trading at 7.65%-7.70%. Bond yields inched higher by 2-3 bps across the curve, with the benchmark 10 Yr bond yield ending the month at 6.76%, up by 2 bps compared to last month’s closing of 6.74%. OIS curve steepened as the 5 Yr OIS yield was higher by 16 bps, ending the month at 6.20%. 1 Yr OIS ended the month at 6.51%, up by 10 bps on the month. FPI flows revived in December with debt flows at USD 1.40 bn, taking the total FPI flows into debt for CY2024 to USD 18 bn. Banking deposit growth has exceeded the credit growth this fiscal with the banking system deposits growing by 7.80%, compared to the credit growth of 7.00% in FY25 so far. Globally, bond remined under pressure with the US Fed delivering a hawkish rate cut as it reduced its forecast of rate cuts for 2025. The US Fed lowered its rate cut forecast for 2025 to 2 rate cuts from 4 earlier and also raised the inflation and the neutral rate forecast. BOJ stood pat on rates but it is expected that they will increase their policy rates twice in 2025. A hawkish Fed coupled with the challenging debt situation in US, sticky inflation amidst robust GDP growth has led to a sharp rise in US bond yields in the last quarter. The benchmark US 10 Yr Bond yield ended the year at 4.57%, up by almost 90 bps over the last three months. The elevated US and global bond yields along with the rise in the dollar index has put pressure on emerging market currencies and bond yields. The dollar index has surged by 6.15% in CY2024 and the INR has depreciated by 2.88% in CY2024. RBI has intervened quite aggressively to contain INR depreciation and RBI is short almost USD 60 bn in the NDF market. India’s foreign currency reserves are down by USD 43 bn from its peak. The pressure on INR due to a strengthening US dollar and expectations of a rebound in the GDP growth in H2FY25 has reduced expectations of policy rate cut from RBI but we continue to expect RBI to cut policy rates starting from February 2025 onwards as Inflation is likely to moderate further. We also expect the external situation to stabilise gradually as markets seems to have factored in a lot of negatives. Bonds will continue to be supported on expectations of monetary easing and we expect yields to continue to drift lower gradually. Retracement in yields from current levels will offer a good opportunity to investors to increase their allocation to fixed income. PGIM India MF Outlook While there are some headwinds in terms of slowing earnings growth, lacklustre capex, INR depreciation and subdued consumption, we reckon some of the above may be transient and will resolve over time. Importantly, corporate debt/GDP are at lows, banks are well capitalised, capital markets are strong and hence there is enough fuel available for long-term productive asset creation which keeps India’s growth story intact. We are mindful of geopolitical actions in terms of tariffs and rate cuts which could result in measures being taken by impacted countries and that needs to be closely monitored. We believe that despite global challenges, India continues to be the fastest-growing economy among major nations, reflecting its resilience. Factors such as sustained domestic economic growth, political stability, prudent reforms, infrastructure investment, healthy corporate finances, ample foreign reserves, controlled twin deficits, stable crude prices, and lower commodity inflation protect India from external shocks and position it for future growth. We are optimistic on investments in high-growth and good-quality companies with a medium to long-term investment horizon. The Market that was The NIFTY 50 declined 2% in December after a flattish November, but gained 8.8% in CY2024. Mid Cap and Small Cap indices outperformed the Large Cap index and were up 1.4% and 0.6% in December and 23.9% each (both Mid Cap and Small Cap indices) in CY2024. Sector-wise, healthcare and realty were the best-performing sectors in the month of December and in 2024. Power, metals and PSU indices declined 7%, 5.4% and 5.2% in December. Rupee was down 1.3% at INR 85.6 vs USD and India 10 Yr yields rose by 6 bps during the month to 6.81%. FPIs bought USD 59 mn of Indian equities in the secondary market, whereas DIIs bought USD 4 bn. FIIs net sold USD 170mn in CY24. On the other hand, DIIs have continued to remain net buyers to the tune of USD 62 bn in CY24. Within DIIs, mutual funds have been the key buyers, contributing to USD 50bn buying. On the economy front, November CPI decelerated to 5.5% YoY from 6.2% in October and back to September levels of 5.5% due to correction in food prices. Sequentially, inflation eased by -15 bps vs. 134 bps hike in the previous month. Core CPI (ex-food and fuel) remained stable at 3.8% as in the last month with sequential pace slowing to 20 bps vs. 59 bps in the last month. WPI also eased to 1.9% in November, compared to 2.4% in October. The index of industrial production (IIP) marginally improved and grew by 3.5% YoY in October vs. growth of 3.1% in September, buoyed by festival-driven demand, reversing a 0.1% contraction in August. Manufacturing/Electricity/Mining registered 4%/2%/1% YoY growth. 18/23 industries advanced YoY. Trade deficit in November further expanded to USD 38 bn (versus USD 27 bn in October and USD 20 bn in September), almost entirely led by a jump in gold imports from USD 7 bn in October to USD 16 bn in November. FY25 April-Nov’24 fiscal deficit touched 52.5% of budgeted estimates (BE) vs. 50.1% of the budgeted estimates same time last year. Direct tax collections are 12% higher YoY with personal income taxes higher by 24% YoY while corporate taxes are down 1% YoY. On the indirect tax side, collections are higher 9% YoY with higher customs growth offsetting weaker GST collections. YTD capex is only 46% of BE and -12% lower than last year. So far, capex has been concentrated in railways (67% of BE and -1% YoY), roads and transport (54% of BE and -16% YoY) while the other primary focus defence is lagging (42% of BE and -16% YoY). A monthly run rate of INR 642 bn so far and with four months to go gives a steep rate of INR 1494 bn (more than double of what has been clocked so far to achieve the budgeted estimates). System credit growth remained weak for the month of November at 10.6% YoY (Oct’24: 11.5% YoY) due to weak retail credit growth of 13.3% YoY (Oct’24: 12.9% YoY) and weak services credit growth of 13% YoY (Oct’24: 12.7% YoY). The weakness in growth is mainly due to stress in unsecured credit. Credit growth has largely converged with deposit growth which stood at 10.7% YoY driven by tightening of risk weights on unsecured loans and NBFC credit. INR4.5t Equity net inflows at record high in CY24 INR264.6b Amount garnered through SIPs at a new high INR66.9t MF industry’s AUM jumps 32% YoY According to Motilal Oswal Fund Folio Report, domestic MFs saw their equity AUM rise for the 11th consecutive year to INR33.4t (+40% YoY) in CY24. AUM growth was fueled by an uptrend in market indices (Nifty: +9% YoY) and higher equity scheme sales (at INR9,120b; +69% YoY). However, redemptions also rose 40% YoY to INR4,645b, leading to a rise in net inflows (more than double YoY) to INR4,475b in CY24 (all-time high) from INR2,063b in CY23. The MF industry’s total AUM increased 32% YoY (INR16.1t) to INR66.9t in CY24, propelled by the growth in equity funds (INR9,537b), liquid funds (INR1,727b), balanced funds (INR1,533b), other ETFs funds (INR1,424b), and income funds (INR954b). Investors continued to park their money in mutual funds, with inflows and contributions in systematic investment plans (SIPs) reaching a new high of INR264.6b in Dec’24 (up 4.5% MoM and 50.2% YoY). NFO Period: 16th January –30th January, 2025 Bengaluru, January 14, 2025: Groww Mutual Fund has introduced the Groww Nifty India Railways PSU ETF, aiming to offer retail investors the opportunity to invest in the Indian Railways ecosystem, a fundamental pillar of India’s infrastructure. The NFO period of the scheme is from 16-30 January, 2025 This ETF seeks to replicate the performance of the Nifty India Railways PSU Index -TRI, comprising Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs) essential to the railways sector, spanning infrastructure, financial services, logistics, and technology. Capitalizing on India’s Growth Story* Indian Railways is critical to the country’s transportation and logistics ecosystem, with a vast network spanning 68,584 km and over 7,325 stations. It facilitates seamless transportation for 6.7 billion passengers annually—equivalent to the world’s population—and handles 27% of India’s freight movement. The sector is undergoing a significant transformation, supported by a record ₹2.52 lakh crore in government capital expenditure for FY 2024-25. Initiatives include the transition to safer, more efficient rolling stock, station upgrades, high-speed rail projects, and the adoption of renewable energy solutions like solar installations, aligning with sustainability goals while reducing operational costs. In adherence to the Reserve Bank of India guidelines, Punjab National Bank (PNB), nation’s leading public sector bank, urges its customers to update their “Know Your Customer” (KYC) information by 23.01.2025 to ensure smooth functioning of their accounts. This is applicable only for those customers whose accounts were due for KYC updation as of 30.09.2024. As part of the KYC compliance exercise, PNB customers are requested to provide their updated information like identity proof, address proof, recent photo, PAN/Form 60, income proof, mobile number (if not available) or any other KYC information at any branch. It can also be done through PNB ONE/Internet Banking Services (IBS) or registered e-mail/post to their base branch by 23.01.2025. Failure to update KYC details within the stipulated time may result in restrictions on account operations. “The WPI inflation expectedly rose to 2.4% in December 2024 from 1.9% in November 2024, while printing slightly lower than ICRA’s estimate (+2.6%). The uptick was led by the fuel and power and primary non-food articles, which together accounted for as much as 42 bps of the 48 bps increase in the headline print between these months. The WPI food inflation remained unchanged at 8.9% in December 2024 vis-à-vis November 2024. Among food items, the inflation in vegetables and edible oils remained elevated, printing above the 25% mark in the month. The core (non-food manufacturing) WPI inflation inched up slightly to a five-month high of 0.7% in December 2024 from 0.5% in November 2024, while remaining below the 1.0%-mark for the fifth consecutive month. The prices of major vegetables, such as tomato, onion and potato, have declined quite sharply on a sequential basis in January 2025 so far. However, the relatively lower weight of vegetables in the WPI vis-à-vis the CPI, would limit the benefits on this account to the headline WPI inflation in the month. Moreover, the import duty hikes on most varieties of edible oil that were undertaken in mid-September 2024, are expected to continue to weigh on the year-on-year (YoY) WPI-food inflation print in January 2025. Consistently outperform Sensex over the past five fiscals1 New Delhi, January 14 2025: The benchmark of equity alternative investment funds (AIFs) investing in unlisted securities achieved a remarkable pooled internal rate of return (IRR) of 21.5% between fiscals 2013 and 2024, according to the second edition of the Crisil-Oister report, ‘No ifs about AIFs 2.0’. Across the past five fiscals, the benchmark outpaced the BSE Sensex Total Return Index (TRI), reaffirming the resilience and importance of private markets in India’s investment landscape. Stage-wise, the benchmark of early-stage funds generated a pooled IRR of 26.9% between fiscals 2013 and 2024, outperforming the BSE 250 Smallcap TRI by 4.29%. Similarly, the benchmark of growth and late-stage funds delivered a robust pooled IRR of 23.6% between fiscals 2015 and 2024, surpassing the BSE 200 TRI by 5.97%. IRR captures both realised and unrealised gains. The distribution to paid-in (DPI) capital ratio shows the realised gains for an investor. The benchmark belonging to the earliest vintage — fiscal 2014 — had a DPI ratio of 1.56, meaning investors received 56% more than their initial investment as of March 2024. Says Sandeep Sinha, Co-CEO, Oister, “This year’s Crisil-Oister report reinforces our long-held belief that private capital is not only participating in India’s growth story but also shaping it. In fiscal 2024, private markets once again demonstrated their ability to outperform and lead through long-term growth and sectoral innovation, setting a benchmark for resilience, scale and innovation.” Shanti Gold International Limited, a Mumbai-based manufacturer of 22kt CZ casting gold jewellery, based on installed production capacity (Source: CARE Report).

Title: Will There Be A DeFi Cycle In This Crypto Bull Run?

Photo by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images As the crypto market enters a new phase of bullish momentum, the question on everyone's mind is whether Decentralized Finance (DeFi) will once again take center stage. While the DeFi boom of 2020 catalyzed the broader blockchain ecosystem, this cycle may take a more evolved and measured approach, emphasizing utility and long-term sustainability. DeFi has transcended its experimental origins to become a cornerstone of blockchain innovation. By leveraging smart contracts and decentralized infrastructure, it has democratized access to financial services for millions of people worldwide. DeFi isn’t a fringe experiment anymore, but a proven disruptor. In 2021, an estimated 1.4 billion people were unbanked, and another billion were underbanked. DeFi offered a pathway to financial inclusion, enabling users to bypass traditional gatekeepers. Today, stablecoins anchor the market, and DeFi lending platforms, decentralized exchanges (DEXs), and staking protocols have changed how capital flows for good. To evaluate the possibility of a DeFi cycle, we need to examine the current market dynamics. The ongoing bull run has seen a resurgence in Bitcoin and large cap asset prices, with total market capitalization exceeding $3 trillion USD. However, DeFi’s growth hinges on more than just market optimism. The rise in DeFi TVL has brought on several new innovative solutions in the market. Among the emerging players shaping this next phase is Nudge, a company introducing a new primitive in the DeFi ecosystem: programmable incentive payments called “nudges.” According to Markus Maier, co-founder of Nudge, “Nudges are programmable incentive payments that allow protocols to pay users for reallocating assets, liquidity, or activity on-chain. Think of it as getting paid—or ‘nudged’—to shift your assets, change to a staking provider, or start using a new Layer 2 solution.” Nudge’s approach, termed “reallocation primitives,” represents a shift in how resources are utilized across DeFi platforms. Users can earn rewards for reallocating their assets while protocols gain measurable and scalable tools for user acquisition and retention. This concept moves beyond traditional token rewards, offering a more targeted and efficient mechanism for ecosystem growth. “The inspiration behind nudges,” Maier adds, “was the crowded landscape of protocols competing for the same pool of users and capital. By enabling users to earn from reallocating their resources, we create new incentives that align their actions with the broader ecosystem’s success.” Other rising players include Convex Finance and Tokemak. Convex Finance, built on top of Curve Finance, enhances yield opportunities for liquidity providers and Curve stakers by streamlining rewards and boosting incentives. Tokemak, on the other hand, serves as a decentralized liquidity provider, optimizing capital deployment across the ecosystem with its unique liquidity reactors. While retail-centric DeFi solutions like Nudge aim to make financial tools more accessible to individual users, there is another category of DeFi applications that focuses on institutional utilities, bridging the gap between traditional finance and decentralized systems. For example, Singapore's Project Guardian explores institutional DeFi by experimenting with tokenized bonds and deposits to assess the potential of decentralized financial infrastructures. Backed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), it aims to integrate tokenized assets with permissioned liquidity pools, providing a secure and scalable blueprint for institutional adoption. One of the critical factors influencing the future of DeFi is regulation. As governments worldwide grapple with the challenges of overseeing decentralized systems, the impact of new policies on DeFi cannot be overstated. Regulatory clarity could either propel DeFi into mainstream adoption or stifle its growth. Recent developments suggest a mixed bag for the industry. The European Union's Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA)regulation aims to create a comprehensive framework for crypto assets, including DeFi protocols. While this offers a path toward legitimacy, critics argue that overly stringent requirements could hinder innovation. In the United States, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has ramped up its scrutiny of DeFi platforms, emphasizing the need for compliance with existing securities laws. This has prompted many projects to consider decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) structures to navigate regulatory hurdles. "While regulation is necessary, it must be balanced to foster innovation," says Maier. For a more in-depth look at regulatory considerations, I recommend reviewing the Key Elements of an Effective DeFi Framework, published by the Crypto Council of Innovation in which I was a co-author. Here, we have outlined the principles for crafting policies that encourage innovation while ensuring consumer protection and financial stability. Several factors could reignite a DeFi cycle in this bull run: “The next DeFi cycle will prioritize utility over hype,” added Maier. While uncertainties around regulation and market sentiment persist, the fundamentals of DeFi remain strong. With innovative platforms like Nudge leading the way and continued advancements in blockchain technology, the stage is set for a potential DeFi resurgence in this bull run. The next few months will be crucial in determining whether DeFi can overcome its challenges and reclaim its position as a driving force in the crypto ecosystem. One Community. Many Voices.

Title: U.S. stocks close mixed as PPI data eases inflation concerns

Wednesday, 15 Jan 2025 NEW YORK, Jan. 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. stocks ended mixed on Tuesday, after the lower-than-expected U.S. producer price index (PPI) data offered temporary relief to investors concerned about persistent inflation. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 221.16 points, or 0.52 percent, to 42,518.28. The S&P 500 added 6.69 points, or 0.11 percent, to 5,842.91. The Nasdaq Composite Index shed 43.71 points, or 0.23 percent, to 19,044.39. Seven of the 11 primary S&P 500 sectors ended in green, with utilities and financials leading the gainers by adding 1.30 percent and 1.28 percent, respectively. Meanwhile, communication services and health led the laggards by dropping 0.97 percent and 0.94 percent, respectively. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' PPI for December 2024 showed a 3.3 percent year-over-year increase, up from November's 3.0 percent but below economists' projections of 3.5 percent. On a monthly basis, PPI rose 0.2 percent, coming in under the forecasted 0.4 percent gain. The core PPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose 3.5 percent year over year, edging up from November's 3.4 percent but below expectations of a 3.8 percent increase. Month over month, core prices were flat, a marked slowdown from the anticipated 0.3 percent rise and November's 0.2 percent gain. Capital Economics North America economist Thomas Ryan noted the release "seems encouraging" but it also "masks some price jumps in a few of the key components which feed directly into the Fed's preferred core PCE inflation gauge." Notably, domestic and international airfare prices -- which feed into the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index -- jumped in December. Major technology stocks continued their decline on Tuesday, with Nvidia losing 1.1 percent and Apple falling 0.5 percent. Both companies have had a sluggish start to 2025 after the significant gains in 2024. On the bond market front, the U.S. Treasury yields initially dropped following the PPI report. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield on Tuesday settled at 4.793 percent, up 0.6 basis points. Still, markets remain cautious as they await further confirmation from the consumer price index (CPI) report for December 2024, set for release Wednesday morning. Attention is also turning to the start of the fourth-quarter earnings season, with major financial institutions like JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, and BlackRock scheduled to release their results on Wednesday.
