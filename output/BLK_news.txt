Tokenization platform the BPX Exchange was added to the U.K.'s crypto register on Thursday, the first new addition since April and only the third this year, according to the Financial Conduct Authority's (FCA) website. The company, a digital securities exchange for investment funds, will now be able to reach out and offer its services to clients in the country as well as approve the promotions of "members of its wider group," the regulator's website said. It won't be able to operate a crypto exchange or offer any services to retail clients. Digital asset firms wishing to operate in the country need to be registered with the FCA and comply with its money laundering and promotion rules, which prevent unauthorized firms from reaching U.K. clients. A total of 52 firms have been approved since 2020. Crypto exchange Coinbase and asset manager BlackRock also joined the register this year. Not only has the U.K. been taking steps to be known as a crypto hub since 2022 by laying out new legislation and consulting with firms to establish new rules for the industry, the current government has also said it wants the country to be a tokenization hub. Tokenization occurs when companies create a virtual investment vehicle on the blockchain that is linked to real world assets like securities.

Title: Toncoin price spikes 13% amid major Telegram-related news
URL: https://coinjournal.net/news/toncoin-price-spikes-13-amid-major-telegram-related-news/

Toncoin (TON) price caught the crypto market’s attention on Wednesday as it rose sharply amid broader market struggles for Bitcoin and top altcoins. With 13% in price gains in the past 24 hours, Toncoin ranked among the top gainers on the day, outpacing the likes of Quant, Uniswap, and Injective among the top 100 by market cap. TON, native to The Open Network blockchain, rallied as traders raced to buy amid a series of major Telegram news. As the price of Toncoin soared by more than 13%, trading volume rose through the roof. As per data from CoinMarketCap, Toncoin recorded a 410% spike in volume, hitting $745 million. TON’s price reached highs of $3.69 before slightly retreating to $3.48 at the time of writing. Gains see TON token up by more than 10% in the past week. Before the latest gains, Toncoin price largely traded flat over the week, with no momentum after bulls gave up ground. Is this uptick thus going to push the altcoin to above $5? The price last hovered above these levels in early 2025. As noted above, the main catalyst for Toncoin’s notable price surge is a series of positive news. The vibe mostly relates to two major announcements linked to Telegram and the TON Foundation. First, the TON Foundation revealed the appointment of Nikola Plecas as its new Vice President of Payments. Plecas, a former Visa executive with deep expertise in crypto product innovation, is tasked with scaling TON’s payment infrastructure to cater to Telegram’s massive user base of over 1 billion. His focus will be on enhancing interoperability, security, and scalability—key pillars for mainstream adoption of Web3 payments. Plecas’s experience at Visa, where he shaped the company’s global crypto strategy, positions him as a pivotal figure in TON’s ambition to revolutionize payments within the Telegram ecosystem. Also fueling optimism around TON is news that Telegram plans to raise $1.5 billion through a bond sale. Notably, market reaction largely jumped as traders noted that Telegram’s initiative is backed by Wall Street heavyweights like Citadel and BlackRock. That’s not all. TON is also expanding its ecosystem, integrating Ethena’s USDe and tsUSDe stablecoins for in-app savings. Collaboration with Tether via LayerZero for a multi-chain network has also been a key development.

Bitcoin BTC$104,803.00 has mostly traded sideways since printing record highs above $110,000 last week. The loss of upward momentum is now accompanied by signs waning bullish sentiment among market participants trading options tied to BlackRock's spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). That's evident from the one-year put-call skew, which reflects how the market prices in volatility risk for put options, offering downside protection relative to calls, representing bullish bets. Negative values represent a bullish bias while positive values suggest fears of downside. IBIT's one-year skew has bounced to nearly zero from the four-month low of minus 3.8 two weeks ago, according to data source Market Chameleon. In other words, IBIT options traders are no longer chasing upside via options. Perhaps they are expecting a pullback. Similar mood is evident in Deribit-listed options where the short-term call skew has weakened, meaning calls expiring in the next two weeks are trading at par with puts, according to data source Amberdata.

Title: Telegram announces partnership with Musk

Time Published: 2025-05-29T09:47:09Z
Full Content:
Elon Musk’s startup xAI will invest $300 million and deploy its Grok AI chatbot in partnership with the messaging app Telegram, according to a statement by the app’s CEO Pavel Durov published on Wednesday. In announcing the deal, Durov said that he and Musk had agreed to a one-year partnership designed to strengthen Telegram’s financial position. “We will receive $300M in cash and equity from xAI, plus 50% of the revenue from xAI subscriptions sold via Telegram,” he said. Musk later stated on X that “no deal has been signed,” without providing any additional details, prompting Durov to clarify that the parties had reached an agreement in principle, with formalities still to be finalized. Telegram said Grok AI is set to be integrated into Telegram, with users expected to begin accessing the AI-powered features starting this summer. Users will be able to interact with Grok directly within the app, using a built-in chatbot to generate content or engage in open-ended conversations on a wide range of topics. The partnership with xAI comes amid an effort by Telegram to raise at least $1.5 billion through a new bond issuance, including from existing backers such as BlackRock and Abu Dhabi investment firm Mubadala. Telegram is reportedly expected to use the funds to buy back debt issued through an earlier bond sale. The deal signals that investors continue to support Telegram, even as its CEO faces charges in France. Durov, whose company is based in Dubai, was arrested in France in August 2024 and accused of complicity in crimes allegedly committed by Telegram users, including extremism and child abuse. He was later released on €5 million ($5.46 million) bail. Although he was allowed to travel to the UAE in March, his recent request to visit the US was denied, and he remains under restricted supervision. Telegram’s popularity continues to grow as the app maintains free services for users. In 2025, the messenger surpassed one billion monthly users and last year the app achieved over $1 billion in revenue, marking its first profitable year since introducing monetization. The company’s financial growth has reportedly been driven by a surge in Telegram Premium subscribers and strong advertising performance.

Title: Finance giants in Mumbai are coming home—to Worli

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. Mumbai: Pandurang Budhkar Marg may not roll off the tongue like ‘BKC’, but that hasn’t deterred India’s top financial firms from making a beeline to this stretch of Worli in south-central Mumbai — once a premier business address, now staging a surprise comeback. At the centre of this revival is Altimus, a 41-storey tower co-owned by K Raheja Corp and Singapore’s GIC. Over the past two years, it has quietly pulled marquee tenants away from Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC) and Lower Parel, bringing the corporate spotlight back to Worli. Its tenant list reads like a who's who of global finance: Morgan Stanley, KKR, BlackRock, Barclays, Kedaara Capital and TPG have all leased space at Altimus. Others, like Goldman Sachs, have opted for nearby Raheja projects such as Ascent. Large Indian firms — including Ultratech — are also moving in. Read this | Domestic office market surges as India becomes hub for global occupiers In the early 2000s, Worli’s Ceejay House was India’s most prestigious office address — home to Barclays, Rothschild, and Credit Suisse. But as BKC and Lower Parel powered ahead, Worli slipped out of the spotlight. That tide, it seems, is now turning — with global investors and large Indian firms returning to centrally located towers that offer top-tier infrastructure and access. The shift reflects more than a reshuffling of office addresses. As India’s financial sector expands and global firms grow their presence here, demand is surging for centrally located, premium-grade towers — just as land-constrained hubs like BKC run short on supply. According to real estate consultants Knight Frank India and Anarock Property Consultants, office vacancies in BKC have dropped to a record low of 3-4% from 13-14% four years ago, raising rents and sparking a scramble for nearby areas such as Kalina, Kurla, Worli, and Lower Parel. On average, rent has jumped from ₹300 per sq. ft to ₹400 per sq. ft in three years, Anuj Puri, chairman of Anarock, had said earlier. Maker Maxity is BKC’s costliest location, with rents crossing ₹800 per sq. ft. Average rentals in South Mumbai are less than in BKC, at ₹250-280 per sq. ft per month, according to industry experts. However, traffic bottlenecks in BKC pose challenges for many businesses, prompting some to seek more accessible locations. Speed and accessFor firms like investment management company Alta Capital, the move is about faster, easier connectivity. “The strategic location allows us to interact with all our stakeholders and partners efficiently as we are central to all the major business districts of Mumbai – BKC, Lower Parel and Nariman Point," said Sid Gupta, Alta’s founder and managing partner. The firm leased 6,000 sq. ft at TS Suites, a plug-and-play office product by managed workspace provider TableSpace, inside Altimus.

The new coastal road and sea link are sharply reducing travel times from far-flung suburbs and business nodes. Mumbai Metro's Aqua Line connected to Worli this month. For executives burned out by the BKC commute, Worli’s centrality is a major draw. “There isn’t a lot of commercial space available elsewhere," said an executive from a relocating firm, adding that the commute to BKC was a “nightmare". More firms are not just moving but scaling operations in India. “(Worli has) more convenient access, a central location, and larger space," said an executive at a tenant firm. Barclays, for instance, has taken up 65,000 sq. ft in Altimus as part of its expansion strategy in India. The bank also highlighted the building’s green design and alignment with its net-zero goals for 2050. “Mumbai is where the future of business in the country is unfolding, and ‘Altimus’ truly fits in the top commercial CBD (central business district) assets, globally benchmarked for the best representation of the new emerging India," said Vinod Rohira, CEO and MD, commercial real estate, K Raheja Corp. “Within Mumbai, Worli has emerged as a powerful new magnet, offering access, infrastructure and prestige." “From high-end tech to financial services, we are seeing global firms make long-term bets on India. This is fuelling strong demand for high-quality office spaces that can keep up with the pace and complexity of modern enterprise," Rohira added. From mills to magnatesOnce an industrial zone filled with textile mills and working-class chawls, Worli began transforming in the 1990s and 2000s as mill closures cleared the way for luxury apartments and high-rises. Yet, despite that makeover, it lagged behind the commercial boom in BKC and Lower Parel. Read this | Mint Primer: Why Delhi-NCR is India’s new flex office capital Now, that’s changing. Average office rents in Worli have caught up with top-end properties in BKC, according to JLL India. BKC still commands a premium due to its central business district status and limited supply. While Maker Maxity in BKC set a record with lease rentals, average rents in Altimus, Worli, and the top buildings in BKC hover at ₹400-450 per sq. ft, reflecting a narrowing gap as Worli’s infrastructure and appeal rise, Sodi said. “Worli had lost its sheen to Lower Parel and BKC," said Karan Singh Sodi, senior managing director, MMR and Gujarat at JLL. “Now, the new infrastructure and ready supply are playing a major role in its favour." Besides Altimus and Ascent (Raheja’s 450,000 sq. ft project now anchored by Goldman Sachs), more high-end office projects are on the anvil. One of the largest will rise on a 22-acre plot acquired by Japan’s Sumitomo Corp from Bombay Dyeing in 2023. Work on the master plan is currently on. Also read | Gen…Next…Go! Meet India’s real estate scions Raheja also has a 400,000 sq. ft development in the pipeline. The expected completion of the office project is three years or so. The commercial resurgence mirrors trends in the residential market. In 2024 alone, ten homes in Worli sold for over ₹100 crore each, up from four such transactions the year before. In total, 30 homes priced above ₹40 crore, worth ₹4,862 crore, were sold in Worli in 2023 and 2024, according to Anarock Property Consultants.

Title: Lopez: Needless lawsuits threaten energy policy

At the end of last year, 11 Republican state attorneys general filed a lawsuit that will have significant, presumably unintended, and somewhat strange consequences on the energy market. Naturally, the energy industry and the price Americans pay for that energy are balanced. Spearheaded by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, the lawsuit targets the “Big Three” financial asset managers: BlackRock, State Street and Vanguard. The principal accusation is that the managers manipulated the energy markets by limiting investment in coal. The complaint alleges that these financial firms have suppressed traditional energy sources by acquiring stockholdings and using their leverage to pressure coal companies to shut down or accommodate “green energy” goals. The supporting evidence is weak. As was reported at the time, the Big Three firms participated in environmental efforts aimed at working with businesses across various industries, curtailing greenhouse gas emissions, and creating long-term shareholder value. These three firms have since left many of the broad coalition initiatives they were previously committed to; State Street and BlackRock withdrew membership with Climate Action 100+, and Vanguard and BlackRock withdrew from the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative. These decisions gained widespread attention, with the companies citing various reasons and all affirming their commitment to providing the best investment returns for their clients. However, during their time as participants, the lawsuit claims, the defendants plotted to lower coal prices. This appears to be the fact on which the lawsuit hinges. That claim is wrong, to be charitable. In reality, coal’s decline has resulted from economic and market trends. More affordable and efficient energy options, like natural gas and renewables, have slowly but steadily taken the lead, a trend that has occurred over many years. The most economically beneficial and productive energy agenda would be allowing all energy sources to compete freely and openly so that consumers and businesses can access reliable, affordable and secure energy. An artificially disrupted energy market, like this lawsuit would lead to, can create imbalances between supply, demand and investments, which can be costly to consumers. Any effort that artificially redirects investment — whether by encouraging or discouraging specific businesses — distorts that balance and weakens our energy grid’s long-term resilience, which is already deeply in need of investment. To update America’s declining energy infrastructure and keep pace with surging energy demand, we need broad-based investment in fossil fuels or renewables, and in nuclear power and next-generation technologies. Building a resilient and prosperous energy future requires doubling down on principles that encourage diversity in energy sources and technological innovation that improves efficiency and environmental stewardship.

Title: Tether pumps $5B into U.S tech, mining, and bonds – CEO reveals bold strategy!

Anthony Pompliano hailed Tether’s leadership and “pro-America” stance. Tether, the company behind the world’s largest stablecoin USDT, recently revealed a bold investment strategy focused on fueling growth within the United States. Over the past two years, Tether has funnelled approximately $5 billion of its profits into American companies and infrastructure, signaling a strong commitment to supporting domestic innovation. In a recent announcement on X, CEO Paolo Ardoino highlighted these significant investments, describing them as part of a “pro-America” approach. Taking to X, Ardoino said, “In the last 2 years Tether Group reinvested almost 5 billion USD of its profits within the United States economy and into US based companies. Some examples: Rumble, Blackrock Neurotech, XXI and different Bitcoin mining ventures.” Notably, earlier this year, Tether acquired more than 103 million shares of Class A stock in Rumble, committing $775 million to the video platform. Additionally, through its venture arm Tether Evo, the company invested $200 million in BlackRock Neurotech in 2024, becoming the majority stakeholder in the promising brain-interface startup. Responding to this, Anthony Pompliano added, “Tether has quickly become one of the most important pro-America companies in the world. Thank you for everything that you and the team have done.” In addition to its strategic equity investments, Tether has established a substantial footprint in U.S Treasury securities, holding more than $120 billion in total exposure. This portfolio includes direct purchases, money market funds, and reverse repurchase agreements, positioning Tether as the 19th-largest global holder of U.S Treasury bills. In fact, it has also surpassed Germany’s $111.4 billion stake, according to data from the U.S Treasury Department. These U.S Treasury holdings are vital in supporting USDT’s value, helping maintain its dollar peg and market stability. A significant portion of these holdings is reportedly managed through Cantor Fitzgerald, a prominent American financial services firm. This simply underscores Tether’s reliance on trusted domestic institutions to safeguard its reserve assets. Here, it’s worth noting that in 2025, USDT has recorded figures of $2.09 trillion in transaction volume, with USDC trailing behind at $1.30 trillion, according to Visa’s on-chain analytics. Tether has also recently issued an additional $1 billion worth of USDT on the Tron (TRX) blockchain network. Despite its dominant market position, Tether faces ongoing demands for greater transparency regarding its reserve holdings. Additionally, the stablecoin has drawn criticism for its occasional use by illicit actors. However, the company maintains that it actively collaborates with law enforcement agencies to identify and address any criminal activities involving USDT. This could be a sign of its commitment to regulatory compliance amid growing scrutiny.

Title: JioBlackRock AMC to widen reach, target flows with factor-based passive funds

Capital market regulator SEBI has given permission to Reliance Industries-owned Jio Financial Services and the American multi-national investment management company BlackRock to enter the mutual fund business in six months. The combination of Reliance Jio’s vast digital reach with BlackRock’s global investment expertise, the joint venture will democratise investment opportunities by attracting first-time retail investors. The competition in the MF industry has intensified with the entry of new players especially after SEBI eased the entry barriers to allow more players to enter asset management business and attract new investors from smaller cities. In last one year, the asset under MF industry increased 23 per cent to ₹70 lakh crore while the value of assets held by individual investors in MFs increased 21 per cent to ₹42 lakh crore. In fact, it will be a re-entry after 7 years for BlackRock into the Indian MF business after it sold 40 per cent stake in DSP MF. Tanmay Shah, MD, stock broking firm SIHL said the entry of Jio BlackRock into the asset management business marks a potentially disruptive shift, given the fact that MF penetration is still low. However, he said challenges remain in building investors trust, navigating regulatory requirements and competing with well-established AMCs. On the distribution side, AMFI last year granted execution-only platform license to Jio Payment Bank, a subsidiary of Jio Financial Services. EOP is a digital or online platform, which facilitates MF transactions such as subscription, redemption and switch transactions. Sunil Subramaniam, CEO of independent think-tank Sense and Simplicity said JioBlackRock will try to target becoming the largest player in the passives space by launching multiple factor-based passive funds which tweak an index to generate higher alpha and attract investment from large institutional investors like provident funds and family offices. By bringing in variation in the passive categories, the fund house may be able to charge a slightly higher fee. Using Jio’s marketing muscle it will try to protect its margins by going direct to customers, he said. With Jio Financial focusing on marketing and customer acquisition, and BlackRock bringing in its global expertise in passives, JioBlackRock MF will attempt to disrupt the market and achieve scale in the shortest possible time, he added. The fund will also open an office in GIFT City to channel inward and outbound foreign investments to take advantage of Blackrock’s Global expertise, said Subramaniam.

Title: Bitcoin Over Gold? BlackRock Says The Case Is Clear
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-over-gold-blackrock/
Time Published: 2025-05-28T23:00:47Z
Full Content:
Speaking from the Nakamoto Stage at the Bitcoin 2025 Conference, Robert Mitchnick, Head of Digital Assets at BlackRock, made a compelling case for BTC’s unique position in global finance—suggesting that the world’s largest asset manager sees Bitcoin not only as a legitimate portfolio hedge but also as a superior alternative to gold. Mitchnick described the performance of BlackRock’s iShares BTC Trust (IBIT) as “unprecedented,” but emphasized that this was still the early stage of adoption. “It’s very early in the life cycle of an ETF,” he said. “In many instances, it takes multiple years to truly get all the cylinders firing—from education to institutional diligence to onboarding across major wealth platforms.” While IBIT has already gained massive traction in US markets, BlackRock has recently launched a similar product in Europe and sees global expansion as essential. “We’re excited,” Mitchnick said. “This has really been a global story… even if you look at IBIT’s numbers, a massive amount of that actually comes from offshore wealth channels, including Asia.” A key theme of Mitchnick’s remarks was the growing institutional normalization of BTC. He cited BlackRock’s own model portfolios—widely used by wealth managers—as a turning point. “In February of this year, just about three months ago, one of those portfolios added Bitcoin as an allocation in the 1 to 2% range,” Mitchnick said. “That was not a sudden reaction to any one thing—that was the result of multiple years of analysis and research.” These allocations, he explained, allow financial advisers to include BTC without requiring direct client demand, accelerating passive adoption across advisory networks. Mitchnick pushed back hard against the long-standing claim that BTC merely behaves like a speculative tech stock. “Through most of Bitcoin’s history, it’s had very low correlation [to equities],” he noted. While he acknowledged periods of short-term alignment—particularly among leveraged retail traders—he argued that institutional investors see BTC differently: “They view Bitcoin as a differentiator in a portfolio and a potential hedge against some of the left-tail risks that exist elsewhere in traditional assets.” He illustrated the point with a sharp anecdote: “Think back to August 5th… the market had a mini meltdown and Bitcoin got clobbered that day. It had nothing to do with Bitcoin fundamentally… but Bitcoin doubled over the next four months.” According to Mitchnick, this shows how short-term volatility often leads to accumulation by long-term holders—those who view Bitcoin not as a “risk-on asset” but as a monetary hedge. Asked directly about the ongoing gold-versus-BTC debate, Mitchnick avoided the typical zero-sum framing. “They’re both global, scarce, decentralized, fixed-supply assets,” he said. “Gold has much less volatility and a longer history. But Bitcoin is digitally native, efficient to store, and can be transferred anywhere in near real time at near-zero cost.” Then he delivered the verdict: “Bitcoin has much higher upside than gold—and lower downside.” He also addressed why this narrative isn’t more dominant. “It’s amazing to me that the industry hasn’t promoted this more effectively,” he said, criticizing financial media and research firms that still link BTC’s value to irrelevant macro headlines. “Bitcoin’s never heard of tariffs. Doesn’t know what they are.” When asked about future crypto ETFs beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, Mitchnick drew a firm line. “Bitcoin is in a category of one,” he said. “The rest of crypto competes in different lanes, with different use cases… it looks more like tech equities or venture exposure.” As a result, he expects the correlation between BTC and other digital assets to fall further. On the topic of regulation, Mitchnick welcomed the growing bipartisan interest in Washington. “It’s just a great and encouraging thing that there is such momentum behind developing a regulatory framework,” he said. “Whether we’re talking about stablecoins or market structure, there’s great momentum there—and we’re excited to see how that shakes out.” At press time, BTC traded at $108,879.

XRP is back in the spotlight, now trading hands at just under $2.30. Investors remain bullish as excitement builds over a potential U.S.-listed spot XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) going live in the near future. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is now evaluating whether a proposed XRP ETF by WisdomTree offers adequate investor protection and safeguards against manipulation. The fund would be a major step toward broader institutional access and legitimacy for the Ripple-affiliated crypto if approved. According to a May 27 notice published by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, has started reviewing the WisdomTree XRP Trust. This marks the first formal review of a U.S.-based spot XRP ETF by the Commission. The SEC now has up to 240 days to approve or reject the ETF filing that would allow investors to gain exposure to XRP without having to hold or store the token themselves. The investment vehicle would track XRP’s market price via the CME CF Ripple-Dollar Reference Rate. If greenlighted, the WisdomTree XRP Trust would be the first American spot XRP market ETF — a watershed that could unlock the door for similar vehicles based on other altcoins. The Commission is now looking for public comments on whether the ETF’s design satisfactorily addresses concerns related to market manipulation and investor protection. Besides WisdomTree, a bevy of other investment managers, including Franklin Templeton, 21Shares, Bitwise, and Grayscale, have all applied with the SEC to introduce XRP ETFs in the U.S. This comes as a new Trump-Vance administration has rolled into Washington, which has taken a more lenient approach to crypto. The SEC itself has also turned a new regulatory leaf following former SEC Chairman Gary Gensler’s departure in January, dropping most of the high-profile cases lodged during the Biden era. Bloomberg senior ETF analysts forecast an 85% chance of spot XRP ETF approval after the change in leadership at the SEC. The price of XRP is trading lower by 3.4% over the past 24 hours to $2.26. Approval of spot exchange-traded funds could unlock institutional capital, amplifying demand for XRP and potentially propelling prices toward $10. Some analysts even believe the XRP price could hit the elusive $100 threshold if prominent players like BlackRock and Fidelity jump into the ring.

The IPO would deepen the existing relationship between BlackRock and Circle, as it would constitute one of the largest single-investor stakes in the crypto company. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. BlackRock plans to acquire approximately 10% of the shares offered in Circle’s initial public offering (IPO), Bloomberg News reported on May 28. People familiar with the matter said Circle and its shareholders, including co-founder and CEO Jeremy Allaire, are seeking to raise $624 million through the offering. Orders for the offering have reportedly exceeded the number of shares available, with the pricing scheduled for June 4. BlackRock already manages the Circle Reserve Fund, a government money market fund that holds roughly 90% of the reserves backing Circle’s USDC stablecoin. The fund reported nearly $30 billion in net assets as of April 30, 2024, based on the Circle IPO filing. The investment management firm could acquire its stake directly or through an affiliated entity, although its final participation remains subject to change. As a result, the IPO would deepen the existing relationship between BlackRock and Circle, as it would constitute one of the largest single-investor stakes in the crypto company. The filing also revealed a combined interest from major institutional investors, indicating heightened demand for equity in the stablecoin issuer as it prepares to enter the public markets. Circle’s USDC ranks as the second-largest US dollar-pegged stablecoin with a $61.3 billion market cap and plays a central role in crypto transfers. The stablecoin registered a $10 trillion year-to-date transfer volume as of April 30, according to data from Artemis. Pending legislation in Congress proposes backing stablecoins with cash or government securities, a structure already in place for USDC through the Circle Reserve Fund. Circle’s decision to proceed with a US-based IPO reflects broader efforts by crypto companies to secure public market capitalization at a time when federal regulatory policy is trending toward acceptance. Kraken is also reportedly eyeing an IPO for 2026. The IPO filing formalizes Circle’s long-anticipated listing plans, which previously included a terminated Special Purpose Acquisition Company deal in 2022. With backing from institutional players and a reserve fund managed by the world’s largest asset manager, Circle is positioning itself to expand operations under a more transparent and regulated capital structure.

BlackRock Inc. is considering acquiring roughly 10% of the shares offered in Circle’s upcoming initial public offering (IPO), Bloomberg reported Wednesday, citing people familiar with the matter. The IPO filing, made public on Tuesday, lays out plans to offer 24 million Class A shares — 9.6 million from Circle and 14.4 million from existing stakeholders. According to the filing, Cathie Wood’s ARK Investment Management has expressed interest in buying up to $150 million worth of the IPO shares. The shares are expected to be priced between $24 and $26, and will be trading under the ticker 'CRCL'. BlackRock’s potential involvement, though significant, is still up in the air. Bloomberg reported that it remains unclear whether BlackRock would invest directly or via an affiliated vehicle, and that it could ultimately walk away from the deal. BlackRock didn't immediately respond to CoinDesk's request for comment. The asset management giant already maintains a close relationship with Circle. It manages the Circle Reserve Fund, a government money market fund that holds 90% of the reserves backing Circle’s USDC stablecoin. USDC is one of the largest dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies, used widely across crypto trading and DeFi protocols. If BlackRock follows through, the move would mark another major entry point for traditional finance into the digital asset space, further entrenching stablecoins like USDC in the broader financial system. The IPO would make Circle one of the few large crypto-native firms to go public in the U.S. after a long lull in public market debuts from the sector. Circle previously attempted to go public via a SPAC merger in 202, which was subsequently scrapped.

The native token of the Telegram-affiliated The Open Network, the 18th largest crypto by market value, was trading at $3.37, CoinGecko data shows. TON soared to almost $3.70 and was up about 23% at one point earlier in the morning. Telegram’s fortunes, which have risen in recent months, continued to swing upward on Wednesday. The company is preparing to raise $1.5 billion in a corporate-bond sale, The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday, citing several sources familiar with the company's plans. The messaging platform will issue five-year bonds offering a 9% yield—a raise that has invited interest from Emirati-owned investment firm Mubadala, BlackRock, and hedge-fund manager Citadel, according to The Journal. Telegram has shared with investors that it clocked $540 million in profits on $1.4 billion in revenue in 2024, people familiar with the matter told the publication—a major rebound from its lackluster performance the year prior. The app boasted one billion active users as of March 2025, according to Telegram's executives, and enrollment in its subscription services has roughly doubled over the past year or so. Separately, Telegram will deploy AI-powered chatbot Grok to its growing platform under the terms of a one-year agreement with Elon Musk's xAI, Telegram founder Pavel Durov said Wednesday in a social media post. Telegram will receive half of xAI's subscription sales made through the messaging platform, Durov tweeted. Later in the day, however, Musk pushed back on the announcement, replying on X hat "No deal has been signed." Durov replied, "True. Agreed in principle, but formalities are pending." The price of TON dipped following the exchange. Durov is still facing criminal charges in France related to alleged illegal activities hosted on Telegram, leaving the application's future somewhat uncertain. French authorities arrested Durov in August, alleging Telegram facilitated terrorism and drug trafficking enterprises, among other nefarious activities, on its platform. And earlier this month, authorities declined the founder's appeal to travel to the U.S. for "negotiations with investment funds,” POLITICO reported. Telegram created TON in 2018, but distanced itself from the network just two years later as it faced regulatory scrutiny over its role in the project. However, the messaging application began flirting with TON nearly two years later, hosting the TON Wallet App and tap-to-earn games in its application. The latter initiative helped TON garner widespread recognition last year, as viral tap-to-earn games such as Catizen and Hamster Kombat‌ amassed hundreds of millions of players on Telegram.

Title: TON jumps 16% as Telegram gets $300M plus xAI equity to integrate Grok

Telegram bags $300M in xAI deal as profits and bond bets reset trajectory. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Telegram is no longer just a privacy-first chat app for crypto bros. With a dramatic one-two punch, a $300 million alliance with Elon Musk’s xAI and a $1.5 billion high-yield bond raise, Telegram has moved from insurgent platform to profit engine. TON jumped 15% after Durov confirmed the collaboration. Yet its future, including IPO prospects, remains hostage to a legal tangle playing out in French courts. In a headline-grabbing move, Telegram announced an exclusive distribution agreement with xAI that will embed Grok, Musk’s LLM chatbot, into the platform for one year. The terms: xAI will pay $300 million in cash, as well as equity and 50% of all Grok-related subscription revenue generated through Telegram. “Together, we win ❤️📈🏆,” posted CEO Pavel Durov, celebrating what he framed as a platform-defining moment. The move marks Telegram’s first major monetisation of its 1 billion monthly active users (MAUs) – a sharp pivot from its historically donation- and debt-fuelled operations. Durov has insisted that Grok integration won’t compromise user data: “No Telegram data will be supplied for Grok training,” he wrote. The deal puts Telegram ahead of rivals like WhatsApp and Snapchat, who’ve struggled to extract revenue from AI features within messaging ecosystems. Telegram also disclosed its first-ever profit: $540 million in 2024, on revenue of $1.4 billion. This figure marks a dramatic turnaround from prior years, when the company operated at a steep loss. With 15 million paying users and organic growth of 2.5 million users per day, 2025 revenue is forecasted at $2 billion, with profit exceeding $700 million. For investors, the metrics finally validate Telegram’s long-gestating monetisation model. Along with announcing its AI deal, Telegram completed an oversubscribed $1.5 billion bond offering at a 9% yield, with major backers including BlackRock, Citadel, and Mubadala, according to WSJ. The five-year paper refinances debt from a 2021 convertible note and includes an IPO-linked conversion sweetener, an implicit bet that Telegram will go public before 2030. The bond’s success surprised some market watchers, especially given CEO Durov’s ongoing legal entanglements. But investors appear willing to price that risk as noise against Telegram’s unit economics and growth profile. Despite operational momentum, a significant cloud looms over Telegram’s prospects: founder Pavel Durov’s arrest in France in August 2024 and subsequent indictment on 12 preliminary charges, including non-cooperation with child safety investigations. Durov remains under judicial supervision and is barred from leaving France. A May 12 court ruling blocked his planned trip to the U.S. to meet investors. “We complied with all the binding legal requests we received,” Durov told the WSJ. “Up until this day, we don’t understand what we did wrong.” The legal case could delay or derail IPO ambitions, raise governance concerns, and complicate global platform operations. It also emphasizes broader regulatory questions about the liabilities of end-to-end encrypted app providers. Is Telegram now on a glide path to IPO? Possibly, but not inevitably. The bond’s conversion feature suggests that at least the option remains alive. But some analysts argue the high-yield raise could be a bridge or even a hedge, a way to lock in growth without public-market scrutiny while Durov navigates his legal peril. The one-year Grok integration, too, carries open questions: Will AI subs stick? Can xAI deliver? Will regulators scrutinise the data layer despite Durov’s assurances? And if Musk stumbles, what becomes of the promised $300 million? Still, with its platform pivot, Telegram has shed the image of a burning-money outlier. Whether it becomes a public tech titan or a cautionary tale may depend as much on courtroom outcomes as on product-market fit. Telegram’s summer surge, marked by AI monetisation and a bold debt raise, signals a company evolving into a sustainable business. But Durov’s legal cloud may prove the ultimate variable in whether Telegram becomes the next great tech IPO or a cautionary tale of platform governance in the age of encryption.

Title: Blockchain oracle RedStone brings tokenized TradFi assets to Solana in partnership with Securitize
URL: https://cryptobriefing.com/redstone-tokenized-tradfi-assets-solana/
Time Published: 2025-05-28T14:00:03Z
Full Content:
Share this article RedStone is launching its blockchain oracle services on Solana in partnership with Securitize, enabling access to tokenized traditional financial assets like US Treasuries and credit products, the company announced on Wednesday. The integration, powered by Wormhole Queries, is aimed at providing Solana builders with price feeds for both traditional and crypto assets. Developers can now incorporate real-world assets (RWAs), such as Apollo’s $ACRED or BlackRock’s $BUIDL, into dApps. Discussing the launch, RedStone co-founder Marcin Kazmierczak said the development represents a foundational shift in how tokenized RWAs are utilized on Solana. Rather than serving solely as static, tokenized instruments, RWAs can now be actively composed within DeFi protocols, enabling practical use cases that bridge traditional financial products with on-chain systems. “This is a foundational step in making RWAs not just visible but usable in DeFi on Solana,” said Kazmierczak in a statement. “It’s no longer just about tokenization — it’s about composability and unlocking use cases that merge traditional and onchain finance.” Securitize, which partners with major asset managers including Apollo, BlackRock, and VanEck, has chosen RedStone as the oracle provider for its tokenized products. The company said it has accumulated over $3.6 billion in tokenized assets under management. “We’re seeing the walls come down between TradFi and DeFi,” said Securitize’s Head of Credit and DeFi, Reid Simon. “The next evolution is about giving global institutions the tools to transact seamlessly across chains.” RedStone’s collaboration with Securitize, announced in March, helps enhance the usability of Securitize’s tokenized funds across DeFi platforms. RedStone delivers price feeds for these assets, enabling their integration into money market exchanges and collateralized DeFi platforms, with cross-chain capabilities on networks such as Ethereum, Avalanche, and Polygon. Earlier this month, RedStone’s $ACRED feed was successfully deployed in a Morpho vault on Polygon, one of the first live DeFi vaults to integrate a major RWA. The Solana expansion could enable similar products to reach a wider audience, from retail to institutional users. Share this article Sign in to your account Don’t have an account?

Instant messaging app Telegram has signed a deal with Elon Musk's xAI to integrate the Grok AI service within the app. Telegram founder Pavel Durov, revealed on X, that the two companies agreed to a 1-year partnership that would see Telegram receive $300 million in cash and equity from xAI, in addition to 50% of revenue from xAI subscriptions sold via Telegram. "Together, we win!" Durov wrote. The deal comes as Telegram looks to raise $1.5 billion via a bond offering that is being backed by the likes of BlackRock, Mubadala, and Citadel. The proceeds of the raise will be used to repurchase debt from Telegram’s earlier bond issuance in 2021. The messaging giant has 1 billion customers and reported a $540 million profit on $1.4 billion in revenue in 2024.

Share this article Telegram, the popular messaging platform, is preparing to issue at least $1.5 billion in new bonds on Wednesday, having secured commitments from both new investors, including Citadel, and established bondholders such as BlackRock and Mubadala, The Wall Street Journal reported early Wednesday. The bond will have a 5-year term at a 9% yield, according to the report. Proceeds from the bond offering will be used to buy back Telegram’s 2021 bonds, which mature in March 2026. About $400 million of that earlier debt has already been repurchased. Investors will have the option to convert their debt into shares at a discount if Telegram pursues a public offering, though an IPO appears unlikely in the near term. The deal signals that investors remain confident in Telegram’s financial trajectory and user growth, despite legal uncertainty around its founder, Pavel Durov. Durov has faced preliminary charges in France for allegedly refusing to cooperate with investigations into illegal activity on the platform. After being detained and investigated in France last year, in March, Durov was granted permission by an investigating judge to temporarily leave France. In a statement post-return to Dubai, United Arab Emirates, where Telegram’s headquarters and operations are located, he stated that Telegram has not only met but also exceeded legal expectations in moderation, cooperation, and crime prevention. Ahead of the bond offering, Telegram reported a $540 million profit in 2024, according to the Financial Times, which cited a company presentation shared with potential investors. The profit marked a sharp turnaround from a $173 million loss the previous year, with revenue soaring to $1.4 billion, driven largely by premium subscriptions, advertising, and partnerships tied to the Ton blockchain ecosystem. The announcement sparked a rally in Toncoin (TON), the crypto asset tied to The Open Network, which climbed 6% to nearly $3.2 shortly after the news, according to CoinGecko data. TON has previously shown a quick reaction to developments involving Telegram and its CEO. Last August, the token plunged 18% following Durov’s arrest, only to rebound after his release. Also on Wednesday, the TON Foundation announced it had appointed former Visa executive Nikola Plecas as vice president of payments to lead its global payments strategy. Plecas will focus on enhancing payment capabilities within The Open Network (TON) and managing partnerships, particularly involving TON and Telegram, while also overseeing compliance.

Title: 2 trades BlackRock bond chief Rick Rieder told us he's making to help generate almost 7% yield

Full Content:
It's been a particularly busy start to the year for BlackRock's bond chief, Rick Rieder — not that someone overseeing $3 trillion in assets has all that much spare time to begin with. The economic policy uncertainty that President Donald Trump has introduced has sent the bond market flailing in a way Rieder hasn't seen before. But the volatility isn't necessarily a bad thing. "There is change afoot. One of the great things about investing in this environment is it's not static," Rieder told Business Insider. "The reaction function to any piece of news can be really extreme," he added. "So markets go through these periods of illiquidity, and it just presents these great opportunities that, by the way, may only be there for 10 minutes, or an hour, or a day. But I've never seen markets move to such extremes." Rieder shared a few of those opportunities he's leaning into at the moment in his iShares Flexible Income Active ETF (BINC), which yields 6.6% and has grown to $9 billion in assets since launching in May 2023. One of them is the front end of the yield curve, or short-duration Treasurys. Yields on the two-year note had dropped from 4.3% last year to 3.6% in April as investors started to price in as many as five rate cuts from the Federal Reserve. But as rate-cut expectations have fallen, yields have risen back up to nearly 4%, making them more attractive. Front-end bonds also offer a hedge for economic volatility in the short term, allowing investors to clip a robust coupon without being locked in for too long. The long end of the curve, meanwhile, isn't acting as a recession hedge, Rieder said, with investors worried about inflation from tariffs and rising yields thanks to ballooning fiscal spending deficits. "I'd rather keep yield up and not have to worry about the volatility," Rieder said. "The long end is not a hedge," he added. "Its traditional offsetting risk function doesn't work today, and so until yields move significantly higher, I don't see any significant reason to own longer in interest rates." Long-end rates in Europe, however, are more attractive, Rieder said. He said he's betting on European B- and BB-rated high-yield bonds to deliver higher yields. This is because economic growth is slowing to a greater degree in Europe than in the US, and inflation is tamer, so the European Central Bank is likely to cut rates more aggressively. This has meant limited upside volatility for European rates. For example, while 10-year Treasury yields have surged from 3.99% to 4.43% since April 4, 10-year eurozone bond yields have been virtually flat, falling by just 3 basis points from 3.13% to 3.1%. When yields rise, bonds lose their value, and vice versa. "Taking some of your interest-rate risk in Europe versus the US — particularly versus long US — has been an exciting thing to be involved with," Rieder said. "Usually, US and European rates move together," he added. "Now you're seeing historic movements of European rates relative to the US, meaning European rates are much more stable." Plus, the dollar's weakness relative to the euro is icing on the cake. "Because of the cross-currency swap, you could buy Europe and you get a couple of percent of additional yield," Rieder said. To mitigate the downside risk of some of the higher-yield bonds in his portfolio, Rieder pairs them with high-quality assets like AAA collateralized loan obligations, he said.

Title: Tether’s 2-Year, $5 Billion Investment Blitz Fuels US Companies: CEO

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Tether, the issuer of the USDT stablecoin, has quietly funneled roughly $5 billion of its earnings into a mix of US businesses and government debt over the past two years. It’s putting money where its mouth is. According to CEO Paolo Ardoino, these moves are meant to show how tied the company is to the American economy, even as it dominates markets abroad. According to Ardoino, Tether invested $775 million in Rumble earlier this year, scooping up more than 103 million shares of Class A stock. The firm also put $200 million into BlackRock Neurotech in 2024 through Tether Evo, its venture arm. That move made Tether the majority owner of the brain‐interface startup. These aren’t small stakes. They’re big plays on what could be the next wave of tech growth in the US. In the last 2 years Tether Group reinvested almost 5 billion USD of its profits within the United States economy and into US based companies. Some examples: Rumble, Blackrock Neurotech, XXI and different Bitcoin mining ventures. (That’s on top of having more than 120 billion in… — Paolo Ardoino 🤖 (@paoloardoino) May 26, 2025 Based on reports, Tether has also built positions in several US‐based Bitcoin mining firms. It recently boosted its holding in Bitdeer to 21%, making it one of the top shareholders. On top of that, the company is routing hash power to the OCEAN pool, tying its crypto reserves even more directly to American mining operations. It’s a mix of finance and hardware. According to filings, Tether holds more than $120 billion in US Treasury bills. That makes it the 19th‐largest holder of US debt, ahead of countries like Germany ($111 billion) and the United Arab Emirates ($104 billion). These Treasury bills back most of the USDT in circulation. In a way, Tether has become a major player in the bond market, with a clear interest in keeping US fiscal matters steady. Based on statements from Ardoino, Tether plans to launch a new dollar‐backed coin for the US market once federal rules are in place. While USDT will stay active in developing nations, a fresh token could meet upcoming US stablecoin laws. With $153 billion in USDT out there—about 60% of the total stablecoin supply—Tether still leads globally. But in the US and Europe, USDT has seen some exchange delistings over MiCA compliance worries. A homegrown coin may smooth those relations. Tether’s strategy isn’t without challenges. It faces calls for more transparency on its reserves and criticism over the use of USDT by bad actors. The company insists it works closely with law enforcement when criminal funds surface.

When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. They say journalists never truly clock out. But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Title: Wall Street rallies on Trump’s EU tariff delay

Wall Street’s roller-coaster ride created by President Donald Trump’s trade policies whipped back upward on Tuesday, this time because of a delay for his tariffs on the European Union. The S&P 500 leaped 2% in its first trading since Trump said Sunday that the United States will delay a 50% tariff on goods coming from the European Union until July 9 from June 1. The European Union’s chief trade negotiator later said on Monday that he had “good calls” with Trump officials and the EU was “fully committed” to reaching a trade deal by July 9. The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 740 points, or 1.8%, and the Nasdaq composite rallied 2.5%. They more than recovered their losses from Friday, when Wall Street’s roller coaster dropped after Trump announced the tariffs on France, Germany and the other 25 countries represented by the European Union. Such talks give hopes that the United States can reach a deal with one of its largest trading partners that would keep global commerce moving and avoid a possible recession. Trump declared a similar pause on his stiff tariffs for products coming from China earlier this month, which launched an even bigger rally on Wall Street at the time. “We focus on actions over words,” Jean Boivin and other strategists at BlackRock Investment Institute said, “as economic constraints spur policy rollbacks.” Caution still remains on Wall Street, of course, even if the S&P 500 has climbed back within 3.6% of its record after falling roughly 20% below the mark last month. A worry is that all the uncertainty caused by on-again-off-again tariffs could damage the economy by pushing U.S. households and businesses to freeze their spending and investments. Surveys have already shown U.S. consumers are feeling worse about the economy’s prospects and where inflation may be heading because of tariffs. On Tuesday, though, optimism ruled. The stock market’s gains accelerated after a report released by the Conference Board said confidence among U.S. consumers improved by more in May than economists expected. It was the first increase in six months, and consumers’ expectations for income, business and the job market in the short term jumped sharply, though it still remains below the level that typically signals a recession ahead. About half the survey results came after Trump paused some of his tariffs on China. The rise in confidence was widespread, covering different age and income groups, according to the Conference Board. On Wall Street, Nvidia rallied 3.2% and was the strongest single force driving the S&P 500 higher ahead of its profit report coming on Wednesday. It’s the last to report this quarter among the “Magnificent Seven” Big Tech companies that have grown so large that their stock movements dominate the rest of the market. Nvidia has been riding a tidal wave of growth created by the frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology, but it is also facing criticism that its stock price has shot too high. Informatica climbed 6% after Salesforce said it would buy the AI-powered cloud data management company in an all-stock deal valuing it at about $8 billion. Salesforce rose 1.5%. They were part of widespread gains across the U.S. stock market, where 93% of the stocks within the S&P 500 rose. One of the outliers was AutoZone, which fell 3.7% following a mixed report on its performance for the three months through May 10. Its profit fell short of analysts’ expectations, though its growth in revenue was stronger than expected. CEO Phil Daniele said both its DIY and commercial businesses did well domestically, but shifting moves in foreign-currency values put pressure on the retailer’s operations outside the United States. All told, the S&P 500 rose 118.72 points to 5,921.54. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 740.58 to 42,343.65, and the Nasdaq composite gained 461.96 to 19,199.16. In the bond market, Treasury yields eased to take some of the pressure off the stock market. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.44% from 4.51% late Friday. It had been rising last week, in part because of worries about the U.S. government’s rapidly increasing debt. Yields had been climbing for bond markets around the developed world, particularly in Japan, where a recent auction of longer-term bonds found relatively few buyers. But analysts said worries eased a bit after Japan’s finance ministry sent a questionnaire to bond investors that they took as a signal of efforts to calm the market. In stock markets abroad, European indexes mostly rose, while Asian indexes were mixed. ___ AP Business Writers Matt Ott and Elaine Kurtenbach contributed.
