Matias Delacroix/AP hide caption UNITED NATIONS — The United States and China clashed over the Panama Canal at the United Nations on Monday, with the U.S. warning that Beijing's influence over the key waterway could threaten global trade and security and China calling U.S. accusations a pretext to take over the canal. The clash took place at a U.N. Security Council meeting where Panama's President José Raúl Mulino stressed the neutrality of the canal and his country's ownership of the waterway linking the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Panama holds the council presidency this month, and Mulino was chairing a meeting on challenges to maritime security. Interpol Secretary General Valdecy Urquiza told members these include piracy, armed robbery, transnational crime and cyber criminals weaponizing artificial intelligence to attack ports where there is "minimal cyber security, maximum exposure." U.S. President Donald Trump thrust Panama into the spotlight even before winning election last November by suggesting that his country should consider retaking control of the Panama Canal and accusing Panama of ceding influence to China. The U.S. built the canal in the early 1900s as it looked for ways to facilitate the transit of commercial and military vessels between its coasts. Control of the waterway transferred to Panama in 1999 under a treaty signed in 1977 by President Jimmy Carter. China's U.N. Ambassador Fu Cong emphasized to the council that "Panama has consistently and effectively managed the canal, making significant contributions to global shipping and trade." "China has always respected the permanent neutrality of the canal and firmly supports Panama in safeguarding its sovereignty over the canal to ensure its openness and smooth operation," he said. Acting U.S. Ambassador Dorothy Shea, who spoke afterward, went after China, expressing concern about its "outsized influence over the Panama Canal area, especially over critical infrastructure and port operations." Alluding to its claims in the South China Sea, she said, "China's expansive and unlawful maritime claims and aggressive actions demonstrate its threat to maritime security and commerce." She said the U.S. rejects these claims and supports countries opposing them. "China's influence in the canal area is not just a risk to Panama and the United States, but rather a potential threat to global trade and security," Shea said. The Trump administration has pressured China to have the Hong Kong-based operator of ports at either end of the canal sell those interests to a U.S. consortium that includes BlackRock Inc. Panama has vehemently rejected a takeover of the canal, but in April, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth visited Panama and agreed with Mulino to step up security coordination. The agreement also gives U.S. troops access to strategic air and naval facilities in the Central American nation, which sparked large protests in Panama's capital. China's Fu asked for the floor to respond to Shea's accusations after all council members spoke, this time lashing out at the Trump administration. "The United States' fabrication of lies and groundless attacks against China are nothing but a pretext for seeking control of the canal," he said. The Chinese envoy called the U.S. and its deployment of offensive weapons in the South China Sea area "the biggest disrupter of peace and stability" in the region, and he accused the administration of exacerbating risks to global maritime security. "China firmly opposes economic coercion and bullying practices and urges the United States to stop fabricating rumors, lies and creating trouble," Fu said. Murillo then responded, saying he wanted to stress Panama's sovereignty "in terms of the ownership of the canal" and the multilateral treaty governing its administration. He called the canal's neutrality "the only and the best defense" to any specific or global threats. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor

Title: All-Time High For Crypto Market: Ethereum Leads The Charge Above $4,000

On Monday, the total crypto market capitalization (TOTAL) reached an all-time high (ATH) of $4.03 trillion, driven by significant gains in leading cryptocurrencies Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), reflecting renewed optimism in the crypto space fueled by favorable regulatory developments from the US. Ethereum notably broke through the $4,000 barrier for the first time in almost nine months, closing the gap to its all-time high of $4,878, now just 13% away. This upward momentum has been attributed to growing interest in cryptocurrencies, bolstered by pro-crypto regulatory measures that have enhanced market sentiment. Notably, the US has spearheaded a new wave of pro-crypto regulations, sparking a surge in investment in the digital asset market with the passage and signing of the first crypto bill, the GENIUS Act. This new legislation aims to create a more favorable regulatory framework for stablecoins, which are dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies. Ethereum plays a key role in the stablecoin market, as a large portion of stablecoin activity occurs on its blockchain. In contrast, Bitcoin approached its current record high of $123,000 earlier in the day but ultimately fell short of the critical $120,000 mark, which is seen as essential for entering a new price discovery phase. Despite this, the overall market sentiment remains buoyant, particularly in light of recent executive orders from President Donald Trump aimed at fostering a more favorable environment for digital assets. On Thursday, Trump issued directives calling for a reevaluation of federal guidance on integrating cryptocurrencies into employer-sponsored retirement plans like 401(k)s. Analysts view this shift as a potential boom for the crypto industry, especially considering that 401(k) assets totaled $8.7 trillion in the first quarter of 2025, according to the Investment Company Institute. As such, Ethereum has outperformed many of its peers among the top ten cryptocurrencies, posting gains of just over 13% in the past week. The only token to surpass this growth has been Cronos (CRO), which saw an 18% rally during the same period. Crypto analyst Doctor Profit has weighed in on Ethereum’s performance, suggesting that breaking the $4,000 barrier signals a massive breakout from an ascending triangle pattern on the monthly chart. This pattern is considered bullish, indicating that Ethereum could continue its upward trajectory in the coming months. In a recent analysis shared on X (formerly Twitter), Doctor Profit projected that Ethereum might reach new heights, potentially hitting $8,000. If this forecast holds true, it would represent an impressive 88% increase from ETH’s current trading price of $4,250 as of late Monday.

Title: How safe is your sunscreen and how long does it last after opening?

Consumer concerns have been raised about the protection offered by sunscreens after some well known brands were found in independent studies to contain less SPF (sun protection factor) than they indicated on the label. The consumer groups Choice and Which? sent a variety of popular sunscreen brands to be tested in accredited independent laboratories to see if they met their stated SPF claims. The brands Ultra Violette and Ultrasun were found to offer much lower levels of SPF than their labels indicated. Choice found that Ultra Violette’s Lean Screen SPF50+ Mattifying Zinc Skinscreen, which retails for €39 at Space NK, returned a SPF rating of just 4 when tested. Separately, Which? revealed that the Ultrasun Family SPF30 lotion, which retails for €35 at Boots, did not meet the minimum required UVA level in their tests. Both Ultra Violette and Ultrasun strongly disputed the claims citing their own testing protocols as superior to those employed in Choice and Which?’s research. Lidl and Aldi’s own-brand products were Which?’s best value sunscreens. Aldi’s Lacura SPF50+ Sensitive Lotion and Lidl’s Cien Sun Spray SPF30, which both retail for €3.99, passed key sun safety tests and were significantly cheaper than their big brand rivals. However, Choice found that another Aldi own-brand sunscreen, Ombra Everyday Sunscreen Lotion 50+, which is not available in Ireland but is sold abroad, returned an SPF rating of just 26. We put Choice and Which?’s findings to three consultant dermatologists, each of whom say they would not be concerned by the results. “Sunscreen testing is technically complex and highly sensitive to variations in methodology,” says Prof Caitríona Ryan, consultant dermatologist at the Institute of Dermatologists and Blackrock Clinic. “In the case of the recent Choice report, several products were tested using a small sample size, which is well below the standard required for international SPF testing. Ultra Violette have since provided retesting data from accredited labs showing that their products do meet or exceed SPF 50+ claims under proper conditions.” Prof Anne-Marie Tobin, consultant dermatologist and professor of clinical medicine at Trinity College Dublin, is more concerned by lack of awareness around the exposure risks of applying expired sunscreen. “You should not use any old sun cream out of your bathroom cabinet, as it may have expired. Expired sun cream will not give you protection against UVA or UVB rays, as the active ingredient in the sun cream will have degraded,” Prof Tobin says. “You can check if your sun cream has expired by looking for a small drawing of a jar with a lid that has a number inside it, which is on every bottle of sun cream. The number tells you how many months you can use your sun cream for after you have opened it.” Prof Ryan adds that while UVB rays are primarily responsible for sunburn and direct DNA damage, UVA rays penetrate deeper into the skin, accelerating photo-ageing and increasing the long-term risk of skin cancer. “Unlike UVB, UVA levels remain constant throughout the year and can penetrate through cloud and glass. This is why choosing a sun cream that offers broad-spectrum protection, which shields against both UVA and UVB, is essential, even on cloudy days or when indoors near windows and particularly when driving,” Prof Ryan says. When it comes to the difference in protection between SPF30 and SPF50, Prof Ryan explains: “The SPF is a time-based measure, it indicates how much longer someone can stay in the sun without burning, compared to wearing no sunscreen. If you would normally burn after 10 minutes of sun exposure, an SPF30 theoretically allows you to stay protected for 300 minutes, while SPF50 would extend that to 500 minutes. SPF30 filters out around 97 per cent of UVB rays, and SPF50 filters about 98 per cent.” Prof Tobin and London-based consultant dermatologist Dr Aamna Adel agree that more people than ever are practising sun safety whether that is because people have aesthetic concerns around skin ageing or they are worried about developing skin cancer. Prof Tobin notes that while patients are very good at applying protection to their faces, they are not as good at protecting their chest, shoulders, neck and back. All three experts agreed that most skin cancers arise from cumulative UV exposure. “You can get skin cancer from being continuously exposed to low levels of UV over many years, rather than a one-off burn. It is best to turn putting on sun cream into an everyday habit like brushing your teeth. However, sun cream is only as effective as the person who applies it and most people don’t apply enough sun cream or don’t reapply their sun cream as frequently as they should,” Dr Adel says. [ Sunscreen: All you need to know to pick the best SPF for your face, scalp and bodyOpens in new window ] Prof Ryan also points to an alarming trend among younger people, using UV index data, not to avoid harm, but to maximise tanning. “Some social media influencers now promote the idea of ‘safe tanning’ during peak UV hours, but UV radiation is a Group 1 carcinogen, and tanning, even without burning, still causes cumulative DNA damage that can lead to skin cancer. There is also a common misconception that sunscreen blocks all vitamin D production, but research shows that people produce adequate vitamin D while wearing SPF.” Prof Ryan has seen an increase in the number of younger adults being diagnosed with melanomas. “Particularly women in their 20s and 30s, which is likely linked to intermittent high-intensity UV exposure from tanning beds and sun holidays.” Prof Tobin advises that most sun protection should be provided by clothing, and staying out of the sun when the UV is strongest between 12pm and 3pm. Skin cancer is the most common cancer in Ireland, with more than 11,000 people diagnosed annually according to the Irish Cancer Society. The National Skin Cancer Registry Ireland expects the number of diagnoses to double by 2040. However, Prof Tobin believes the official diagnosis statistics are actually underestimated because statisticians must verify every case and so are “likely quite behind with the figures they publish”. There are two main categories of skin cancer: melanoma and non-melanoma. Dr Adel says that the symptoms of melanoma are “a mole that is in any way changing in size, colour, texture or even if it begins to itch”. While the symptoms of non-melanoma are: “a spot or scab that is oozing, crusting over or just not healing”. Prof Tobin wants there to be greater awareness around the symptoms of non-melanoma skin cancer as it is the most common form of skin cancer. “About 1,200 people are diagnosed with melanoma skin cancers every year, the rest are all non-melanoma.” Dr Adel frequently encounters people who delay getting checked because they worry that they will be wasting the doctor’s time. “I would much rather have people come to see me with something that does not turn out to need treatment than to wait longer and potentially put themselves at risk. Early detection gives patients the best chance of making a full recovery,” Dr Adel says. [ Six of the best budget sunscreens for summer 2025Opens in new window ] In response to Choice’s SPF protection findings Ultra Violette issued this statement: “Ultra Violette is deeply committed to the health and safety of our customers and only work with reputable, TGA licensed manufacturers who perform substantial quality release testing in accordance with the strictest SPF standards in the world. We do not accept these results as even remotely accurate.” Likewise, Ultrasun disputed Which?’s findings: “Ultrasun is fully confident in our testing protocols. Our chosen testing protocol is one of the strictest available, and our UVB and UVA filters are tested both in vitro and in vivo. We conclusively support the result of our independent tests which found that the Ultrasun Family SPF30 reached a UVB-SPF in vivo of 31.4 and a UVA-PF in vitro of 13.1, which equates to a 92 per cent UVA absorbance.” © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: A US senator from Colombia emerges as a Trump link for Latin America's conservatives

U.S. Sen. Bernie Moreno has emerged as an interlocutor for conservatives in Latin America seeking to connect with the Trump administration MIAMI -- When Republican Sen. Bernie Moreno visits Colombia this week as part of a three-nation tour of Latin America, it will be something of a homecoming. Ohio’s first Latino senator, who defeated an incumbent last year with the help of Donald Trump’s endorsement, was born in the Colombian capital of Bogota, and even as he was chasing the American dream, he kept close tabs on the country through older brothers who are heavyweights in politics and business there. Moreno, 58, has emerged as an interlocutor for conservatives in Latin America seeking to connect with the Trump administration. In an interview with The Associated Press ahead of the trip, he expressed deep concern about Colombia’s direction under left-wing President Gustavo Petro and suggested that U.S. sanctions, higher tariffs or other retaliatory action might be needed to steer it straight. The recent criminal conviction of former President Alvaro Uribe, a conservative icon, was an attempt to “silence” the man who saved Colombia from guerrilla violence, Moreno said. Meanwhile, record cocaine production has left the United States less secure — and Colombia vulnerable to being decertified by the White House for failing to cooperate in the war on drugs. “The purpose of the trip is to understand all the dynamics before any decision is made,” said Moreno, who will meet with both Petro and Uribe, as well as business leaders and local officials. “But there’s nothing that’s taken off the table at this point and there’s nothing that’s directly being contemplated.” Moreno, a luxury car dealer from Cleveland, defeated incumbent Democrat Sherrod Brown last year with the help of $441 million in political ad spending — the most in U.S. Senate race history. He became Ohio’s senior senator on practically his first day in office after his close friend JD Vance resigned the Senate to become vice president. In Congress, Moreno has mimicked Trump’s rhetoric to attack top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer as a “miserable old man out of a Dickens novel,” called on the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates and threatened to subpoena California officials over their response to anti-ICE protests in Los Angeles. On Latin America, he’s been similarly outspoken, slamming Petro on social media as a “socialist dictator” and accusing Mexico of being on the path to becoming a “narco state.” He also surprised many hardliners in the GOP early on by suggesting in January that Trump should engage with Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro despite his re-election in what the U.S., European Union and other governments condemned as a rigged vote. While referring to Maduro as a “gang leader” and "terrorist," Moreno nonetheless expressed support for the Trump administration's decision last month to allow energy giant Chevron to resume drilling in Venezuela following a deal with Maduro to free 10 jailed Americans held there. “What people wanted to hear in January is that we’re going to fly F-16s into Caracas and wage war against the country and that just wasn’t going to happen,” said Moreno in the interview. “If we take actions that are too much in that direction, we end up turning Venezuela over to China.” Such comments barely register in blue-collar Ohio, but they’ve garnered attention in Latin America. That despite the fact Moreno hasn’t lived in the region for decades and doesn’t sit on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. “He’s somebody to watch,” said Michael Shifter, the former president of the Inter-American Dialogue in Washington. “He’s one of the most loyal Trump supporters in the Senate, and, given his background in Latin America, he could be influential on policy.” Moreno starts his first congressional delegation to Latin America on Monday for two days of meetings in Mexico City with officials including President Claudia Sheinbaum. Moreno, in the pre-trip interview, said that Sheinbaum has done more to combat the flow of fentanyl into the U.S. than her predecessor and mentor Andrés Manuel López Obrador, who he described as a “total disaster.” But he said more cooperation is needed, and he’d like to see Mexico allow the DEA to participate in judicial wiretaps like it has for decades in Colombia and allow it to bring back a plane used in bilateral investigations that López Obrador grounded. “The corruption becomes so pervasive, that if it’s left unchecked, it’s kind of like treating cancer,” said Moreno. “Mexico has to just come to the realization that it does not have the resources to completely wipe out the drug cartels. And it’s only going to be by asking the U.S. for help that we can actually accomplish that.” From Mexico, Moreno heads to Panama, where he’ll tour the Panama Canal with Trump’s new ambassador to the country, Kevin Marino Cabrera. In March, a Hong Kong-based conglomerate struck a deal that would have handed control of two ports on either end of the U.S.-built canal to American investment firm BlackRock Inc. The deal was heralded by Trump, who had threatened to take back the canal to curb Chinese influence. However, the deal has since drawn scrutiny from antitrust authorities in Beijing and last month the seller said it was seeking to add a strategic partner from mainland China — reportedly state-owned shipping company Cosco — to the deal. “Cosco, you might as well say, is the actual communist party,” said Moreno. “There’s no scenario in which Cosco can be part of the Panamanian ports.” On the final leg of the tour in Colombia, Moreno will be joined by another Colombian American senator: Ruben Gallego, Democrat of Arizona. In contrast to Moreno, who was born into privilege and counts among his siblings a former ambassador to the U.S., Gallego and his three sisters were raised by an immigrant single mother on a secretary’s paycheck. Despite their different upbringings, the two have made common cause in seeking to uphold the tradition of bilateral U.S. support for Colombia, for decades Washington’s staunchest ally in the region. It’s a task made harder by deepening polarization in both countries. The recent sentencing of Uribe to 12 years of house arrest in a long-running witness tampering case has jolted the nation’s politics with nine months to go before decisive presidential elections. The former president is barred from running but remains a powerful leader, and Moreno said his absence from the campaign trail could alter the playing field. He also worries that surging cocaine production could once again lead to a “narcotization” of a bilateral relationship that should be about trade, investment and mutual prosperity. “We want Colombia to be strong, we want Colombia to be healthy, we want Colombia to be prosperous and secure, and I think the people of Colombia want the exact same thing,” he added. “So, the question is, how do we get there?” ___ Smyth reported from Columbus, Ohio. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

The ETF, to be listed on NYSE Arca under the ticker B.T., will hold Bitcoin (BTC) directly and seek to track the flagship crypto’s market price. Crypto.com will act as the exclusive custodian, prime execution agent, and liquidity provider, while Yorkville America Digital will serve as the ETF’s sponsor. The ETF’s structure allocates 70% of its assets to Bitcoin, with 15% in U.S. Treasury securities and 15% in cash or cash equivalents, aiming to balance exposure to the crypto with traditional financial instruments. The launch remains subject to SEC approval of both the updated Form S-1 registration and a separate Form 19b-4 listing application. The company has not provided a specific launch date but indicated it expects the fund to go live before year-end. TMTG, parent of the Truth Social social platform, streaming service Truth+, and fintech brand Truth.Fi, said the ETF forms part of a broader Bitcoin-focused strategy. The strategy includes building a corporate Bitcoin treasury and expanding into digital asset products through its financial services division. The company has already committed substantial capital to Bitcoin acquisitions this year, positioning itself among the more aggressive corporate entrants into the sector. If approved, the Truth Social Bitcoin ETF would enter a competitive landscape dominated by heavyweight issuers such as BlackRock, whose spot Bitcoin ETF has drawn billions in inflows since the first U.S. approvals in January and set multiple records. The ETFs have attracted a mix of institutional and retail investors seeking regulated exposure to Bitcoin without the need for self-custody. The filing also highlights the political dimension of TMTG’s crypto ambitions. President Donald Trump, the company’s majority shareholder, has made digital assets a policy priority, pledging to roll back what he calls restrictive regulations and promote U.S. leadership in the crypto economy. A spot Bitcoin ETF tied to a political brand of Trump’s profile would be unprecedented in the market, potentially attracting a distinct investor base but also intensifying public and regulatory scrutiny. The timing of the filing reflects an environment where spot Bitcoin ETFs are gaining mainstream acceptance and competitive differentiation is becoming critical. While the SEC has approved multiple products this year, new entrants face the challenge of building liquidity and investor trust in a market already served by established issuers.

Title: REX Osprey Solana ETF posts zero net flows across majority of August sessions

The main reasons are likely lack of institutional interest and the complicated structure which the ETF is based on, analysts weigh in. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. REX Osprey Solana (SOL) exchange-traded fund (ETF) recorded zero trading activity on four of six trading days through August 8, according to Farside Investors data. Trading under ticker SSK, the fund posted no flows on Aug. 1, Aug. 4, Aug. 5, and Aug. 7, with minimal $6.4 million in activity on Aug. 8 and $2.7 million outflows on Aug. 6. REX Osprey’s fund is the first US-listed Solana ETF to integrate native staking mechanisms. The product operates outside standard SEC-registered spot ETF frameworks, delivering SOL exposure through indirect vehicles rather than direct crypto holdings. CoinShares flow data showed Solana products attracted $874 million in year-to-date inflows, staying behind Ethereum (ETH) and XRP among major cap altcoins despite its position as the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. The trading pattern could reflect broader institutional hesitation toward Solana-focused investment products compared to Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum alternatives. Nansen senior research analyst Jake Kennis attributed the disparity to institutional portfolio allocation strategies. He explained in a note: “ETH is seeing a lot of new activity as institutions were likely underweight ETH relative to BTC. Solana has been mostly in the backseat for this new wave of attention, but SOL ETFs would likely pick up if institutions are looking to also diversify away from BTC and ETH.” The REX Osprey fund’s design incorporates staking mechanisms and offshore ETF allocations that differentiate it from traditional spot cryptocurrency products. Stabolut founder and CEO Eneko Knörr identified these features as adoption obstacles rather than demand deficiencies. Knörr said: “SSK’s quiet tape looks more like a brand and distribution issue than a pure demand problem. Its design isn’t a simple ‘spot SOL in a wrapper’—the fund stakes SOL and can allocate a portion into other SOL ETFs/ETPs, many offshore, which adds complexity that some buyers shy away from.” The fund charges a 0.75% management fee, positioning it at the higher end of cryptocurrency ETF expense ratios. Traditional spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs from major issuers typically carry fees between 0.15% and 0.25%. Kennis, from Nansen, noted that the fee structure creates a cost-benefit analysis for institutional investors weighing direct cryptocurrency exposure against ETF convenience. He referenced Solana’s approximately 7% annual staking rewards: “The staking component seems like a major feature given the ‘passive’ yield being left on the table.” The absence of major financial institutions like BlackRock and Fidelity in the Solana ETF space contributes to limited market penetration. REX Shares operates as a smaller ETF issuer without the distribution networks and brand recognition of Wall Street’s largest asset managers. Knörr argued: “Early trading will likely remain lumpy until bigger brands enter the space. Structure, complexity, and limited shelf space are holding it back—interest in Solana exposure itself doesn’t appear to be the issue.” As of Aug. 11, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is still considering the approval of Solana ETFs under the more tax-friendly 1933 Act.

Title: Why The Trump Administration MAGA Stock Dreams For Fannie And Freddie Could Be A Windfall For Wall Street

BySergei Klebnikov BySergei Klebnikov, Forbes Staff. The Trump administration is teeing up what could be the biggest shakeup in U.S. housing finance since the 2008 crisis—a pair of IPOs that might value Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac at a combined $500 billion. The plan, which was first reported by The Wall Street Journal and is still being finalized by the administration, would see the federal government sell between 5% and 15% of each company, potentially raising about $30 billion in what would be one of the largest stock offerings in American history. Yet behind the fanfare lies a precarious gamble on institutions still tethered to taxpayer support and whose profitability is largely cushioned by an implicit government guarantee. Senior administration officials have in recent days confirmed the plans are far along, though crucial structural decisions—such as whether to list the two separately or together—remain unresolved. President Trump himself has signaled his intention to proceed with the listings this year: “I am working on TAKING THESE AMAZING COMPANIES PUBLIC, but I want to be clear, the U.S. Government will keep its implicit GUARANTEES,” he wrote on social media last week. On Saturday, he posted an edited picture of himself ringing the opening bell at the NYSE for a hypothetical, combined entity called the Great American Mortgage Corporation trading under the ticker “MAGA.” The Treasury—which currently holds the bulk of both government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) equity—could release new shares, sell existing ones, or blend both strategies to create liquidity. Wall Street heavyweights such as JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, and Bank of America have reportedly been asked to advise on pricing and structure. The history of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac is a cautionary tale. Fannie’s roots stretch back to 1938, Freddie’s to 1970; Both were designed to keep mortgage credit flowing by securitizing and guaranteeing home loans. Their business model—buying mortgages from lenders, bundling them into mortgage-backed securities and guaranteeing payment to investors—helped lower borrowing costs for generations of Americans. During the mid-2000s housing boom, both ramped up exposure to riskier loans and loosened underwriting standards, leaving them vulnerable when home prices crashed. During the housing bubble the top executives of these quasi-governmental agencies benefited from compensation packages in the tens of millions. By September 2008, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) had placed them into conservatorship after a combined $187 billion Treasury rescue, wiping out most private shareholder value. In the years since, the GSEs have returned to profitability, paying dividends that exceeded the bailout amount. Yet they have remained under government control, their retained earnings capped for much of the past decade until capital buffers were gradually rebuilt. FHFA’s 2024 Annual Report to Congress shows that by year-end, Fannie Mae’s total equity had grown $17 billion to $94.7 billion, while Freddie Mac’s climbed 24.8% to $59.6 billion. In a brief published earlier this year by Jim Parrott of the Urban Institute, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank, and Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody’s Analytics, the two highlighted the importance of keeping the implicit federal guarantee post-IPO. “Critical to the rating agencies and the Fed is not that the GSEs posed little risk, but that they enjoyed the unlimited backing of the U.S. government,” they write, warning that without that support, funding costs could climb sharply—driving up mortgage rates by 0.6 to 0.9 percentage points as well as shrinking credit access. The pair go on to caution that ending conservatorship without a clear legislative or financial framework risks delivering “no value,” and could leave the system “less liquid and stable.” “We believe it’s essential for the government to retain the explicit government guarantee if they pursue privatization, which could take years to implement,” wrote Lawrence Gillum, chief fixed income Strategist for LPL Financial. “Removing the guarantee would disrupt both markets and make housing even less affordable.” A $30 billion stock sale by the Federal government would provide a one-time boost to Treasury’s coffers but it would only represent an estimated 1.6% slice of the current fiscal year’s projected $1.9 trillion deficit. After the sale it is likely that the Federal government would still own 85% to 95% of the government sponsored mortgage companies and thus benefit from any appreciation in its share price. The windfall would also extend beyond the public purse. Hedge fund billionaires such as Bill Ackman and John Paulson, who built large positions in the mortgage giants years ago betting on their return to the market, could reap outsized rewards if the IPOs hit their targets. Ackman, who has long advocated for the privatization of the two GSEs, owns roughly 10% of the common stock of both Fannie and Freddie through his fund, Pershing Square Capital Management. Ackman’s firm first invested in Fannie and Freddie common stock in late 2013, roughly five years after they were put under government conservatorship during the financial crisis. His cost basis for each averaged just over $2 per share. Today, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae currently trade at $9 per share and $11.50 per share, respectively. According to previous filings from his firm (Pershing Square stopped disclosing these specific holdings in regular filings several years ago), he owned 115.5 million shares of Fannie and 63.5 million shares of Freddie—that stake today would be worth roughly $1.8 billion. Wall Street underwriters also stand to collect millions in advisory fees. Banks like Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase were top originators for Freddie and Fannie last year, while institutions like BlackRock and PIMCO are significant holders of mortgage backed securities. If the Trump administration pulls it off, the planned Fannie and Freddie offerings could rank among the most ambitious privatizations in modern U.S. history. Still, trying to privatize much of the nation’s mortgage infrastructure during the worst housing affordability crisis in a generation will be no easy task, as critics have pointed out. The current administration will no doubt need to be more specific and methodical than they have been so far if they want to avoid losing investor confidence and causing a shock to the financial system.

August 11, 2025 16:30 ET | Source: TheRas, Inc. (d/b/a BBOT) TheRas, Inc. (d/b/a BBOT) SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif. and BOSTON, Aug. 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BridgeBio Oncology Therapeutics, Inc. (“BBOT”) (Nasdaq: BBOT), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on RAS-pathway malignancies, today announced the closing of its previously announced business combination with Helix Acquisition Corp. II (formerly Nasdaq: HLXB) (“Helix”), a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) sponsored by affiliates of Cormorant Asset Management.

Title: SMCP Recovers 15.5% Stake From Singapore After Lengthy Legal Battle

Today's Digital Daily Today's Digital Daily The case of the "missing shares" started in 2021, and has wound its way through several jurisdictions. A takeover could be next. PARIS — SMCP, the parent company of Sandro, Maje, Claudie Pierlot, and Fursac, has regained control of a 15.5 percent stake of its capital as a result of a ruling by the Singapore High Court, following a lengthy legal battle. The group said Monday after market close that the shares — previously transferred in 2021 to Dynamic Treasure Group, a trust registered in the British Virgin Islands — have officially been returned to European TopSoho, a Luxembourg-based holding entity and former majority shareholder of SMCP. The return of the shares follows a July 4 decision by the court in Singapore, where the shares were being held. Related Articles Financial SMCP Q2 Sales Up 3% With Full-price Strategy Boosting Growth Financial SMCP Secures Singapore Court Victory in Battle Over Disputed Share Transfer “The return of the shares clarifies SMCP’s shareholding situation,” the company said in a statement. “The group remains focused on executing its profitable growth strategy, leveraging the desirability of its brands, its operational agility, and ongoing efforts in cost management.” You May Also Like The 15.5 percent stake has been at the center of a years-long shareholder dispute dating back to the financial collapse of Chinese conglomerate Shandong Ruyi, which had acquired a majority stake in SMCP in 2016 through European TopSoho ahead of the group’s 2017 initial public offering. This is the latest twist of the “missing shares” case that began in 2021, when 15.5 percent of the share capital “disappeared” from Luxembourg and reappeared in the British Virgin Islands two-and-a-half months later. They reappeared in the accounts of Dynamic Treasure Group, also controlled by European TopSoho director Chenran Qiu, the daughter of Shandong Ruyi’s founder. European TopSoho had sold them to Dynamic Treasure Group for a symbolic one euro. In the interim, European TopSoho also issued a press release denying Qiu’s involvement in Dynamic Treasure Group, misleading the market. The Singapore court ruling followed a similar decision by the English High Court in July 2024, which canceled the sale of the shares to Dynamic Treasure Group. Jurisdiction moved to Singapore, where the shares were being held in local accounts. European TopSoho, which entered bankruptcy proceedings in February 2023, is now under the control of a court-appointed administrator in Luxembourg. The return of the 15.5 percent stake won’t immediately change control of SMCP but does bring greater transparency to investors. London-based GLAS currently acts as trustee for European TopSoho’s creditors, including BlackRock, Carlyle, Anchorage, Boussard and Gavaudan, who remain SMCP’s largest shareholders. Last year, GLAS revealed its intention to offload 37 percent of the group’s shares — a move that could trigger a mandatory takeover under French law if a single buyer snaps them up. In its second-quarter financial results released July 29, SMCP posted 3.3 percent organic sales growth to 304.5 million euros, as the group doubled down on full-price sales and tighter inventory controls. Chief executive officer Isabelle Guichot’s recovery strategy continues to focus on stabilizing the business following store closures in China, while expanding in new markets including India and the Philippines, and focusing investment on its core brands Sandro and Maje.

Club: Blackrock/Leinster County: Wexford Age: 22 Position: Flanker Wafer had been an injury concern after knee surgery, but is thankfully included in the World Cup squad. She won the 2025 Six Nations Player of the Tournament, was part of the 2024 World Rugby Dream Team, and was player of the match in the victory over New Zealand at the WXV1 tournament last year. Following the World Cup, she’s set for a move to Harlequins. Club: Railway Union/Munster County: Tipperary Age: 30 Position: Winger Perhaps best known for her Sevens antics, having been part of the Ireland team at the Paris Olympics, Costigan (formerly Murphy Crowe) is the Irish record-holder for most tries and was a try-scorer against England in this year’s Six Nations. Club: Railway Union County: Westmeath Age: 26 Position: Outside centre Another Sevens recruit, McGann was unlucky to miss out on the Olympics due to injury. She came back to the 15s to score a hat-trick of tries against Italy in the Six Nations and touched down twice in the warm-up game against Canada.

Title: A US senator from Colombia emerges as a Trump link for Latin America’s conservatives
URL: https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/08/11/senate-moreno-latin-america/
Time Published: 2025-08-11T16:38:35Z
Full Content:
By JOSHUA GOODMAN and JULIE CARR SMYTH MIAMI (AP) — When Republican Sen. Bernie Moreno visits Colombia this week as part of a three-nation tour of Latin America, it will be something of a homecoming. The Ohio senator, who defeated an incumbent last year with the help of Donald Trump’s endorsement and the highest political ad spending in U.S. Senate race history, was born in Bogota and has brothers who are heavyweights in politics and business there. Moreno has emerged as an interlocutor for conservatives in Latin America seeking to connect with the Trump administration. In an interview with The Associated Press ahead of the trip, he expressed deep concern about Colombia’s direction under left-wing President Gustavo Petro and suggested that U.S. sanctions, higher tariffs or other retaliatory action might be needed to steer it straight. The recent criminal conviction of former President Alvaro Uribe, a conservative icon, was an attempt to “silence” the man who saved Colombia from guerrilla violence, Moreno said. Meanwhile, record cocaine production has left the United States less secure — and Colombia vulnerable to being decertified by the White House for failing to cooperate in the war on drugs. “The purpose of the trip is to understand all the dynamics before any decision is made,” said Moreno, who will meet with both Petro and Uribe, as well as business leaders and local officials. “But there’s nothing that’s taken off the table at this point and there’s nothing that’s directly being contemplated.” Moreno, a luxury car dealer from Cleveland, defeated incumbent Democrat Sherrod Brown last year and became Ohio’s senior senator on practically his first day in office after his close friend JD Vance resigned the Senate to become vice president. In Congress, Moreno has mimicked Trump’s rhetoric to attack top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer as a “miserable old man out of a Dickens novel,” called on the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates and threatened to subpoena California officials over their response to anti-ICE protests in Los Angeles. On Latin America, he’s been similarly outspoken, slamming Petro on social media as a “socialist dictator” and accusing Mexico of being on the path to becoming a “narco state.” Such comments barely register in blue-collar Ohio, but they’ve garnered attention in Latin America. That despite the fact Moreno hasn’t lived in the region for decades, speaks Spanish with a U.S. accent and doesn’t sit on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. “He’s somebody to watch,” said Michael Shifter, the former president of the Inter-American Dialogue in Washington. “He’s one of the most loyal Trump supporters in the senate and given his background in Latin America he could be influential on policy.” Moreno, 58, starts his first congressional delegation to Latin America on Monday for two days of meetings in Mexico City with officials including President Claudia Sheinbaum. He’ll be accompanied by Terrance Cole, the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration, who is making his first overseas trip since being confirmed by the Senate last month to head the premier federal narcotics agency. Moreno, in the pre-trip interview, said that Sheinbaum has done more to combat the flow of fentanyl into the U.S. than her predecessor and mentor Andrés Manuel López Obrador, who he described as a “total disaster.” But he said more cooperation is needed, and he’d like to see Mexico allow the DEA to participate in judicial wiretaps like it has for decades in Colombia and allow it to bring back a plane used in bilateral investigations that López Obrador grounded. “The corruption becomes so pervasive, that if it’s left unchecked, it’s kind of like treating cancer,” said Moreno. “Mexico has to just come to the realization that it does not have the resources to completely wipe out the drug cartels. And it’s only going to be by asking the U.S. for help that we can actually accomplish that.” From Mexico, Moreno heads to Panama, where he’ll tour the Panama Canal with Trump’s new ambassador to the country, Kevin Marino Cabrera. In March, a Hong Kong-based conglomerate struck a deal that would’ve handed control of two ports on either end of the U.S.-built canal to American investment firm BlackRock Inc. The deal was heralded by Trump, who had threatened to take back the canal to curb Chinese influence. However, the deal has since drawn scrutiny from antitrust authorities in Beijing and last month the seller said it was seeking to add a strategic partner from mainland China — reportedly state-owned shipping company Cosco — to the deal. “Cosco you might as well say is the actual communist party,” said Moreno. “There’s no scenario in which Cosco can be part of the Panamanian ports.” On the final leg of the tour in Colombia, Moreno will be joined by another Colombian American senator: Ruben Gallego, Democrat of Arizona. In contrast to Moreno, who was born into privilege and counts among his siblings a former ambassador to the U.S., Gallego and his three sisters were raised by an immigrant single mother on a secretary’s paycheck. Despite their different upbringings, the two have made common cause in seeking to uphold the tradition of bilateral U.S. support for Colombia, for decades Washington’s staunchest ally in the region. It’s a task made harder by deepening polarization in both countries. The recent sentencing of Uribe to 12 years of house arrest in a long-running witness tampering case has jolted the nation’s politics with nine months to go before decisive presidential elections. The former president is barred from running but remains a powerful leader, and Moreno said his absence from the campaign trail could alter the playing field. He also worries that surging cocaine production could once again lead to a “narcotization” of a bilateral relationship that should be about trade, investment and mutual prosperity. “We want Colombia to be strong, we want Colombia to be healthy, we want Colombia to be prosperous and secure, and I think the people of Colombia want the exact same thing,” he added. “So, the question is, how do we get there?” Smyth reported from Columbus, Ohio.

Title: Ethereum Bullish Fundamentals Clash With Short-Term Leverage Risks

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Ethereum reached multi-year highs, breaking decisively above the $4,300 level after several days of strong bullish momentum. This breakout marks Ethereum’s highest level since late 2021, fueled by growing institutional demand, ETF inflows, and expanding on-chain activity. However, fresh market data from CryptoQuant suggests that caution may be warranted in the short term. The all-exchange Estimated Leverage Ratio (ELR) has climbed to 0.68, approaching historical highs and signaling excessive market-wide leverage. While Binance’s ELR sits lower at 0.52, indicating more measured positioning on the world’s largest exchange, higher relative leverage on other platforms points to elevated speculative activity elsewhere. Ethereum’s price is currently testing a critical resistance zone between $4,020 and $4,060—a historically pivotal area that has often determined whether a rally accelerates or faces a sharp pullback. Adding to the short-term risk profile, Binance netflows have spiked significantly above the all-exchange average, suggesting concentrated inflows that may lead to localized sell pressure, possibly linked to liquidations or arbitrage-driven trades. According to Crypto Onchain, a CryptoQuant analyst, Ethereum’s mid-term fundamentals remain strongly bullish despite short-term caution signals. Institutional demand is surging, with US Spot Ethereum ETFs recording a record $726.6 million in daily net inflows, driven by giants like BlackRock and Fidelity. This has pushed total ETF holdings above 5 million ETH (valued at approximately $20.3 billion), a milestone that underscores Ethereum’s growing role in institutional portfolios. Beyond ETFs, major players are increasing direct exposure. Ark Invest purchased 30,755 ETH worth $108.57 million, while Fundamental Global allocated $200 million to ETH as part of its treasury strategy. This wave of accumulation reflects deepening confidence in Ethereum’s long-term utility and value proposition. On-chain metrics also paint a bullish picture. Transaction volumes are hitting new highs, and staking participation continues to expand, locking up more ETH and reducing circulating supply. Regulatory clarity—such as the SEC closing investigations into liquid staking—has further strengthened structural demand for ETH. Upcoming network upgrades, including Pectra and Fusaka, are set to boost scalability and lower costs. This will enhance Ethereum’s appeal to both developers and enterprises. In the short term, high leverage, key resistance levels, and concentrated exchange inflows pose a risk of sharp volatility. However, the mid-term outlook remains intact, supported by sustained institutional inflows, robust network growth, and technological advancements. Even if near-term corrections occur, these factors should help cap downside pressure and maintain Ethereum’s broader bullish trajectory. Ethereum’s 4-hour chart shows a strong breakout above the key resistance at $3,860, which had capped price action in late July. Following this decisive move, ETH surged past the $4,300 level, marking its highest point since November 2021. This rally was supported by strong bullish momentum, as seen in the steep incline of the 50-period SMA (blue) and the price holding well above the 100-period (green) and 200-period (red) SMAs. Currently, ETH is consolidating just below its recent peak, around $4,240, signaling a potential pause before the next move. This consolidation at elevated levels, rather than a sharp retracement, suggests that bulls remain in control. The $3,860–$3,900 zone now acts as a critical support, and a retest could provide a healthy setup for continuation. Volume spikes during the breakout indicate strong buying interest, but the reduced volume in the latest candles suggests the market is waiting for fresh catalysts. A sustained move above $4,300 could open the door toward the $4,450–$4,500 zone, while a breakdown below $3,860 would weaken the bullish structure.

Crypto exchange Bullish has raised the size of its initial public offering to $990 million from $629 million, as the company looks to take advantage of a hot market for crypto firms. CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Bullish. According to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday, Bullish is aiming to sell 30 million shares at a price of $32 to $33 each, or $990 million and a valuation of $4.8 billion at the top of the range. In a previous filing on Aug. 4, the company had planned to market 20.3 million shares at $28 to $31 each, or about $629 million and a $4.2 billion valuation at the top of the range. Bullish is one of many crypto companies hoping to take advantage of a booming IPO market in the space as the industry is starting to profit from a clearer regulatory framework and investor interest, not to mention sharply higher prices of late for leading cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether. Stablecoin issuer Circle (CRCL) was among first to go public in June and has seen its share price skyrocket 93% since. In an earlier filing with the SEC, Bullish disclosed that funds managed by BlackRock and Ark Investment Management have expressed interest to buy $200 million worth of shares of the company at the IPO price. The company, which would trade under the ticker “BLSH” also disclosed that it had posted a net income estimate of $106 million to $109 million for the second quarter after reporting losses for the first quarter and the fourth quarter of 2024.

Title: BlackRock Addresses Burning XRP ETF Question: Is A Filing Coming Or Not?

The world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock, has broken its silence on whether it intends to file for an XRP ETF. This follows months of speculation that the firm could soon file to offer this fund. A BlackRock spokesperson told The Block that they have no plans to file for an XRP ETF at this time. This ends speculations that it will join eight other asset managers who have already filed to offer this fund. The world’s largest asset manager already offers Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, and based on the statement, the firm plans to stick with only the two largest crypto assets. NovaDius Wealth President Nate Geraci was one of those who had speculated that BlackRock was going to file for an XRP ETF soon. Prior to the asset manager’s statement, Geraci opined that the firm was waiting for the Ripple SEC lawsuit to end before filing for an iShares XRP ETF. He made this prediction following Ripple and the SEC’s filing of a joint dismissal to end the XRP lawsuit. Geraci further remarked that it makes “zero” sense for BlackRock to ignore crypto assets beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. He added that if they do that, they are basically saying that BTC and ETH are the only crypto assets that will ever have value. Following BlackRock’s statement, the NovaDius Wealth president said that the firm’s decision not to file for an XRP ETF will be looked on as a mistake. Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas also weighed in on BlackRock’s decision not to file for an XRP ETF. He asked Geraci if an XRP filing is enough or if he feels the world’s largest asset manager should also file for SOL, Tron ETFs. He further questioned where exactly the line should be drawn on how many crypto ETFs asset managers should offer. Nate Geraci believes that there will be significant demand for the XRP ETFs, which is one reason why he thinks BlackRock is making a mistake by not filing for one. He noted that futures-based XRP funds have taken in over $1 billion since their launch this year. He opined that this proves that there will be “real” demand for the spot funds. Pro-XRP lawyer John Deaton is confident that BlackRock will still file for an XRP ETF. He said that he is willing to bet that this happens within a year. BlackRock’s failure to file for this ETF now and opt to do so later could prove costly since the pending applications could have the first-mover advantage. According to Bloomberg analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas, there is a 95% chance that the SEC approves these funds this year. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $3.26, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Title: Impact Accounting Has an Equity Problem (Blog)

Is water in Sweden really 25 times more valuable than water in Mauritania? Is water in Sweden really 25 times more valuable than water in Mauritania? By Andrew A. King, Ken Pucker & Jesse Colman Aug. 11, 2025 Impact accounting is the heir apparent to ESG (environmental, social, governance) accounting and investing. Where ESG investing emphasizes risks to the firm, impact accounting measures how corporate actions help or harm people and the planet. Its advocates predict impact accounting will engender a more transparent, responsible, and sustainable capitalism. Sir Ronald Cohen (a financier and leading advocate of impact accounting) and Professor George Serafeim (head of Harvard’s Impact Weighted Accounts Initiative) claim it will “redefine success, so that its measure is not just money, but the positive impact we make during our lives.” Impact accounting has attracted influential advocates. IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva describes it as “a blueprint for a hope-filled future,” while former SEC Commissioner Allison Herren Lee contends it could “ensure that those who want to make an impact will make an impact where it matters most.” Leading corporations have begun adopting impact accounting frameworks: BlackRock, Target, and Eisai have pilot-tested methodologies developed at Harvard University, while Kering—the parent company of Gucci—has created its own proprietary system for dollarizing environmental impact. But impact accounting has a dark side that makes its use dangerous. In a previous SSIR article, “Heroic Accounting,” we reviewed the potential for miscalculation and misuse of impact accounting measures. We also highlighted concerns about the feasibility and the perils of centralized, subjective pricing of externalities. There is another important problem we overlooked in that review: Impact accounting has an equity problem, because practical means for calculating impacts discriminate against poor people. This flaw is challenging to correct because it emanates from impact accounting’s core premise: that social and environmental effects can and should be priced and compared in global monetary terms. One recent example illustrates this defect in particularly stark terms. Are you enjoying this article? Read more like this, plus SSIR's full archive of content, when you subscribe. Evidence of the discriminatory tendencies inherent in impact accounting appears in a recent report by the International Foundation for Valuing Impacts (IFVI)—an organization co-founded by Sir Ronald Cohen and Tracy Palandjian (Co-founder and CEO of Social Finance). The report estimates the social cost of consuming fresh water—a resource of growing global concern—for each country. Strikingly, the IFVI assigns the lowest social cost to Mauritania, a desert nation identified by the World Resources Institute (WRI) as facing an “extremely high” risk of future water scarcity. According to the IFVI, consuming a cubic meter of groundwater in Mauritania causes only $0.13 in social harm. In contrast, Sweden—rated by the WRI as having a "low" water risk—is estimated to suffer $3.23 in social harm per cubic meter of groundwater consumed, nearly 25 times the estimate for Mauritania. These counterintuitive estimates are part of a general trend. The IFVI estimates a low cost of water consumption for other water-scarce nations, including Somalia ($0.27/m³) and South Sudan ($0.53/m³), but calculates a much higher social cost in some countries with abundant water resources. Even rain-soaked Ireland is assigned a higher social cost of water consumption ($0.74 /m3) than Mauritania, Somalia, or South Sudan. Why does the IFVI assess Mauritania, Somalia, and South Sudan as places where consuming fresh water causes minimal social harm? The answer appears to lie in their poverty. In these nations, water is primarily used to produce basic goods for local consumption, which are then sold at low prices. The IFVI’s methodology assumes that low prices reflect low social value, and consequently, it concludes that little harm is caused by sacrificing this production to divert water to other uses. By contrast, in wealthy countries like Sweden and Ireland, water is often used to produce higher-priced goods, including luxury items destined for global markets. The higher market prices of these goods are interpreted by the IFVI as indicators of higher social value, leading to greater estimated harm from water consumption. As shown in Figure 1, all countries assigned low social costs for water use by the IFVI are among the world’s poorest, while rich countries—even those with abundant water resources, such as Sweden, Ireland, and Canada—are assigned significantly higher costs. The IFVI's discriminatory estimates are not caused by a bug or error; they are an inevitable consequence of impact accounting's reason for being—the monetization of social impacts expressed in terms of a global unit of exchange. Monetization makes risky assumptions about the relationship between social value and its monetary expression—price. As scholars Garry Jacobs and Ivo Šlaus (2010) warned, "The temptation to measure all value in terms of price plays havoc with commonsense, reason, and human values." In the case of impact accounting, this temptation results in systematic bias against poor people. In Mauritania, consuming water displaces activities such as subsistence agriculture, which the IFVI methodology interprets as causing minimal social harm, even though these activities are essential for survival. Conversely, in Sweden, water extraction displaces high-priced uses like decorative landscaping and is thus mistakenly assigned higher social value despite its lower importance. As a result, impact accounting risks reinforcing global inequalities under the guise of objectivity. Sir Ronald Cohen argues “We have to be able to measure a company's performance in delivering impacts as well as profits.” But how should impact be measured? In financial accounting, price serves as a valid proxy: Managers aim to minimize the prices paid to suppliers and maximize the prices received from customers. Profit, then, reflects how effectively a firm achieves these goals. The same logic does not hold when measuring impact. Market prices do not reliably capture social and environmental outcomes and relying on price as a stand-in for value can lead to severe distortions. Consider a manager overseeing identical facilities in Sweden and Mauritania who must decide where to invest to reduce the social impact of lost work. The manager’s employees require proficiency in mathematics—and thus earn wages comparable to local math teachers: approximately $57,600 per year in Sweden and $5,000 in Mauritania. Following the IFVI’s approach, the social value of lost work is calculated as the product of wage and time, and by this logic, losing a Swedish worker imposes more than ten times the social harm of losing a Mauritanian one. Consequently, to reduce the firm’s measured impact the manager should invest much more money to reduce lost work in Sweden than in Mauritania. But this conclusion is irrational. Higher wages in Sweden reflect the country’s robust institutions and strong economy, not a greater intrinsic value of worker labor. In contrast, Mauritania’s low wages result in large part from weak governance and systemic corruption, which suppresses economic opportunity and distorts labor markets. A 2023 report estimates that at least 3 percent of Mauritanians are paid nothing at all: They are enslaved. By the IFVI’s method, their work provides no social value! The connection between good government and economic development is well established in the economics literature. “Inclusive political institutions that distribute power broadly in society and are accompanied by inclusive economic institutions create the incentives and opportunities that make a nation prosperous,” write Nobel Laureates Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson in their 2012 book, Why Nations Fail. “Institutions that lack inclusivity—where political and economic power are concentrated—tend to reproduce themselves, creating a vicious circle of deprivation and underdevelopment.” Accordingly, it is not a lack of social impact that causes a Mauritanian worker to receive a salary one-tenth the size of his Swedish counterpart; it is a consequence of his working in Mauritania. Proponents of impact accounting shrug their shoulders at such concerns and respond that any accounting of social costs, even if done inaccurately, is better than no accounting at all. For example, Sir Ronald Cohen writes, “Until now, the prevailing view has been that impact cannot be measured reliably enough to be truly useful, however, in John Maynard Keynes's words, ‘It is better to be roughly right than precisely wrong.’” Unfortunately, inaccurate information can be worse than no information at all. Impact information that directs harm to the poor and dispossessed will cause a decline in social welfare, not an increase, because income has a declining marginal influence on welfare. Depriving $1000 in income to a person in Mauritania, where the average income is $2200, may cause them to have trouble surviving. Deprive that same amount to a person in Sweden, where the average income is 22 times higher, and they may not even notice. If inaccurate information about impacts causes increased harm to poor people, social welfare will decrease. More information will not be better than no information at all. It might seem that the problem outlined above could be solved by adjusting observed prices or by using other methods to calculate impact. But such solutions are extraordinarily difficult to implement. For example, to compare the Mauritanian and Swedish teachers accurately, one would have to calculate the Mauritanian’s wage if the country were well governed and the economy booming. This requires constructing an economic model of the national economy and then simulating how it would function under better governance. Such calculations remain at the frontier of economic theory. Even the most advanced models reduce complex economies to simplified, stick-figure representations of activity. They also require extensive data and research to calibrate and are often opaque in their assumptions and outputs. Ongoing debates surrounding models of the social cost of carbon illustrate just how contested and fragile these estimates can be. Accurately determining the "true" price of every resource in every country is, in practice, impossible. What about simply weighting impacts in poor countries to match those in wealthy ones? In principle, this could work—but how should the weights be determined? One alternative is to use purchasing power parity (PPP)—a method of determining the buying power in local currencies for a basket of goods. It is thought to better capture cost-of-living differences than exchange rates. However, switching to PPP does not fully solve the problem. For example, it still leaves us with the conclusion that Swedish workers provide three times the social value of their Mauritanian counterparts, even if employed in the same job. The creators of the PPP system—the International Comparison Program—caution against using it to compare prices at the unit or industry level across countries because the appropriate valuation factor should vary by product and context. But calculating such variable factors would require building and validating comprehensive models of each national economy, and as with the previous approach, it would be prohibitively difficult to implement such a system. Limiting the scope of use for impact accounting seems to be the best option. For example, impact accounting might allow for comparisons of the impacts within the same governing institution, such as the effects of extracting water in different parts of the same U.S. state. Alternatively, impact accounting could concentrate on genuinely global effects—those that transcend national boundaries—such as the environmental impact of corporate greenhouse gas emissions or global carbon sinks, such as forests and oceanic phytoplankton. We hope our arguments will lead to significant changes in how impact is measured, but that is beyond our control. We expect the proponents of impact accounting to continue to promote it as the heir apparent to ESG. If they are successful, managers and investors may soon confront impact accounting measures. Some guidance in their use is in order: 1. Beware of claims to accuracy. Impact accounting measures present as precise and interpretable dollar values, but this is an illusion. They rest on layers and layers of approximations and assumptions. Understanding those layers is crucial. 2. Avoid cross-country comparisons. Using impact accounts to compare firms across borders—especially between rich and poor nations—risks serious misrepresentation. Impact measures are likely to discount harm to poor people. 3. Check against common sense. If impact accounting tells you water consumption is less harmful where water is scarce, ask why. Check against first principles. Scarcity should increase value, not reduce it. 4. Recognize that impact accounting may be just the latest idea for an easy fix to social and environmental problems. Over the past 40 years, many solutions have been proposed for leveraging the power of business to advance sustainability. All have come and gone, all but one: strengthened institutions. 5. Strengthen institutions. As Acemoglu and Johnston have shown, social outcomes are better where institutions are stronger. We don’t need Nobel Laureates to tell us, we know that from experience. Controlling institutions have made our air and water cleaner, our cars safer, our resources better protected, and our living standard higher. Such institutions are constantly under attack, yet they remain the best way to improve our planet. Impact accounting will likely come and go, but the effect of our institutions will remain. So, strengthen them, be it a social club, local government, national system, or international organization. Doing that will have a real impact.

Business Crypto exchange Bullish is targeting a valuation of up to $4.82 billion after upsizing its initial public offering on Monday, underscoring sustained investor interest in digital assets. Venture capitalist Peter Thiel-backed Bullish's raise, still well below its $9-billion valuation target in a failed 2021 blank-check merger, showcases the expanding role that crypto companies are playing in the momentum built by the IPO markets. "In many cases the initial price range is set well below a company's last private valuation or below what the company had originally hoped for," said Kat Liu, vice president at IPO research firm IPOX. The crypto sector's recent climb to a $4-trillion market value has boosted public market sentiment.

IRELAND HEAD COACH Scott Bemand has named a 32-player squad for the 2025 Women’s Rugby World Cup in England. Munster hooker Beth Buttimer is the one uncapped player included, having impressed in the recent U20 Summer Series. Ex-England players Ellena Perry and Nancy McGillivray, and Connacht’s Ivana Kiripati, who were all capped in the warm-up games, also make the final squad. IrishRugby TV / YouTube Christy Haney misses out with a hamstring injury, while Dorothy Wall and Erin King had previously been ruled out with long-term setbacks. Aoife Wafer is named as Ireland continue to sweat on the fitness of the 2025 Six Nations player of the championship. Co-captain Edel McMahon also makes the plane having emerged as an injury concern last week. Advertisement In all, the squad is comprised of 18 forwards and 14 backs and is captained by McMahon and Sam Monaghan. Alex Codling, Denis Fogarty, Larissa Muldoon, James Scaysbrook and Gareth Steenson make up Bemand’s coaching team. Uncapped U20 hooker Beth Buttimer. Ben Brady / INPHO Ben Brady / INPHO / INPHO “When we qualified for the Rugby World Cup in April 2024, we knew it gave us a solid amount of time to prepare for the tournament,” said Bemand. “We have used that time to build depth and cultivate our ‘Green Wave’. The majority of this squad have now been together since the start of June, and we are excited to finally get going.” Ireland face Japan in their opener on Sunday, 24 August at Franklin’s Gardens, Northampton. They also meet Spain and New Zealand in Pool A as they return to the showpiece tournament for the first time since hosting in 2017. “Missing out on the last World Cup lit a fire in all of us,” McMahon added. “Getting Ireland back on the world stage means absolutely everything, it’s something we have dreamed of and fought for ever since. We’re ready, and we are going to give it everything for our country. “The ‘Green Wave’ is more than just a slogan for us — it’s the spirit we carry onto the field. Over the coming weeks, we want to make our families proud and inspire the nation. This is a moment we’ve worked tirelessly for, and we’ll leave nothing behind.” Edel McMahon and Scott Bemand.

Title: Ireland name one uncapped player in World Cup squad
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/rugby/2025/08/11/ireland-name-one-uncapped-player-in-world-cup-squad/
Time Published: 2025-08-11T09:02:15Z

Only time will tell if Aoife Wafer’s selection by Irish women’s rugby coach Scott Bemand was a calculated risk or not. Perhaps Ireland’s most influential player, Wafer has been included among the 18 forwards and 14 backs selected ahead of the 2025 Rugby World Cup in England, which begins for Ireland in Franklin’s Garden in a few weeks. The 22-year-old, who underwent knee surgery in July after sustaining the injury against Wales, has been central to the Irish team and hopes to be fit for the World Cup Pool C opener against Japan on August 24th. An outstanding backrow, Wafer was named 2025 Six Nations Player of the Championship, but missed Ireland’s two recent warm-up games against Scotland and Canada. Clearly the Irish medics believe she can play a role at some point in the tournament. After Japan, Ireland play against Spain on August 31st and title holders New Zealand on September 7th in the remaining pool games. Japan are ranked 11th and Spain 13th to Ireland’s fifth on the world table. Defending champions New Zealand are ranked third in the world behind first placed England and Canada, who beat Ireland 26-47 last weekend in Belfast. Wafer’s power game has been a critical aspect of Ireland’s play as highlighted in scoring four tries in the Six Nations. But she missed the last game of the championship against Scotland and has been unavailable since then. Edel McMahon, who co-captain’s the squad with secondrow Sam Monaghan, is also among the 32 names. The backrow also injured her knee and did not feature against Scotland or Canada. [ Scott Bemand happy with how Ireland are shaping up for Rugby World Cup despite Canada defeatOpens in new window ] Backrows Dorothy Wall (Achilles) and the dynamic Erin King (knee) also miss out on selection due to injury as does Christy Haney. Prop Haney suffered a hamstring injury, and her place is taken by Ellena Perry, who made her debut in Saturday’s defeat to Canada. Perry won 11 caps with England but hadn’t lined out for them since 2020 and satisfies World Rugby’s stand down rules for switching nations. She is Irish-qualified via a grandparent and plays with Neve Jones and Monoghan at Gloucester. Exeter centre Nancy McGillivray, is another of the selected players, who was named in England squads in the past but was never capped, debuted after qualifying through her Irish-born father. She became available to make the switch after her England contract expired in June. Ireland will undoubtedly miss the injured players. King started at openside flanker in Ireland’s opening three Six Nations matches. Wall had involvement in all five games, playing in the secondrow and backrow, while Haney came off the bench in all the matches. Bemand has also picked one uncapped player, hooker Beth Buttimer as well as two players with one cap, Perry and McGillivray and one player with two caps, forward Ivana Kiripati. [ Ivana Kiripati: ‘I am a Samoan girl, born in New Zealand, doing life in Ireland – how cool is that?’Opens in new window ] The overall look of the side tends towards inexperience when compared to the England squad, who have a couple of players with over 100 caps and several more approaching that number. No Irish player selected has yet reached 50 caps with just five players with 30 or more. But Ireland travel with hope and some momentum, having come from behind to beat Scotland and then finished strongly in the second half of their match against Canada after trailing 33-7 at the interval. “When we qualified for the Rugby World Cup in April 2024, we knew it gave us a solid amount of time to prepare for the tournament,” said Bemand. “We have used that time to build depth and cultivate our ‘Green Wave’. The majority of this squad have now been together since the start of June, and we are excited to finally get going.” Co-captain Monaghan added that having missed out on qualification for the last World Cup in New Zealand, the energy and hope within the group remains high. “The ‘Green Wave’ is more than just a slogan for us – it’s the spirit we carry on to the field,” she said. “Over the coming weeks, we want to make our families proud and inspire the nation. This is a moment we’ve worked tirelessly for, and we’ll leave nothing behind. “Missing out on the last World Cup lit a fire in all of us. Getting Ireland back on the world stage means absolutely everything, it’s something we have dreamed of and fought forever since. We’re ready, and we are going to give it everything for our country.” In an expanded 16 team competition, countries are divided into four pools of four teams (pools A to D). Teams in each pool will play one another in a round-robin format, with the top two teams advancing to the knockout stage. Ireland are eyeing a knockout position in Pool C, which means winning the pool or finishing second. The favourites to top the pool are New Zealand.

Michael Glennon RTÉ Sport Journalist Aoife Wafer and co-captain Edel McMahon have been named in the Ireland squad for the Rugby World Cup, however, Christy Haney misses out through injury. Six Nations player of the tournament Wafer underwent knee surgery last month but the back row has been included in the 32-player squad for Pool C games against Japan, Spain and New Zealand in England, starting on 24 August. Flanker McMahon missed both of Ireland's warm-up games with a knee injury but is also included. Prop Haney suffered a hamstring injury and her place is taken by Ellena Perry, who made her debut in Saturday’s defeat to Canada in Belfast. Perry won 11 caps with England but hadn’t lined out for the Red Roses since 2020 and is Irish-qualified via a grandparent. Similarly, centre Nancy McGillivray, whose father is Irish, makes the cut having switched from the England set-up recently. The Exeter player (below) scored on her international debut against Scotland nine days ago. Flanker Ivana Kiripati, who won caps against Scotland and Canada, also makes the cut but there is no place for Deirbhile Nic a Bháird. There is one uncapped player in the squad, with Munster hooker Beth Buttimer, who impressed in the recent U20 Summer Series, getting the call-up. Forwards Erin King and Dorothy Wall had already been ruled out due to injuries picked up in the Six Nations. Head coach Scott Bemand said: "When we qualified for the Rugby World Cup in April 2024, we knew it gave us a solid amount of time to prepare for the tournament. "We have used that time to build depth and cultivate our 'Green Wave’. "The majority of this squad have now been together since the start of June, and we are excited to finally get going."

Title: Solana Price Prediction: SOL Timeline to $500 Outlined by Experts, But This Play Could Yield Superior Returns In The Interim

Solana price looks primed for a surge in the next few weeks as recent price patterns show it responding to new demand pressure. However, another project is unfolding into the spotlight with the potential to steal the shine from the Solana price prediction. Solana’s standout performance this year has attracted hundreds of whales, driving price growth that could see it at 2x this year. Whereas, while Solana price prediction suggests an incoming 2x before year-end, this other altcoin is projected for 30x in the same time frame. Here is the whole gist on why this could happen even before November. The price action indicates that the SOL price is rapidly recovering from its earlier correction a few months ago and is now poised for a significant breakout. According to the analysis, the Solana price prediction is set at around $500 this year as renewed ETF sentiment fuels institutional demand. The trending Solana price prediction sees the ongoing ETF calls as a catalyst that could see the coin double in price before the year’s end. There is an aggressive accumulation currently ongoing in the Solana ecosystem as new fundamental factors add to its visibility. New utilities such as the Solana PayPal stablecoin integration are boosting demand today. In addition, top brands like Blackrock and Fidelity keeping Solana in their reserve have further renewed hope of Solana’s continuous growth. Solana price prediction speculates a $500 growth this year as it continues to hold a position above the 200EMA. This reflects a long-term bullish momentum that could drive the SOL price to a new high by September as it reclaims old resistance. The price has maintained a position above the $165 resistance in the past few weeks, even in the face of a market drawdown. A breakout of the SOL price beyond $200 this week might see it returning to $294 as new support. Furthermore, the Solana price prediction could be achieved this year if it can hit $350b by early September. This move could fuel a new FOMO rally that can help the Solana price hit $500 as early as November. While Solana price action shows strong bullish potential, analysts say Remittix could hit 30x easily this year. This is because Remittix’s crypto-to-fiat and low-cap potential show promise to drive a strong bull run before December. The last few weeks have seen Remittix become the favourite new entry, raising $18.7 million in a short period. Analysts are saying this fast climb is showing strong market confidence in Remittix utility and could be prime for 30x before December. Remittix growth factors this year include: These catalysts have been fueling a high demand lately as anticipation grows for the Remittix breakout.

Highlights LendingClub CEO Scott Sanborn says that the personal loan market is at its highest TAM ever as consumers face rising interest rates on credit card products and rising prices on everything they buy. LendingClub is moving from lender to a comprehensive financial ecosystem amid rekindled marketing efforts. Sanborn tells Karen Webster that new products like LevelUp Checking offer cash back on essentials and loan payments, while LevelUp Savings incentivizes consistent savings behavior. LendingClub’s latest quarter showed robust originations and profit growth, and marketplace support by heavy hitters like BlackRock.

Δ LendingClub CEO Scott Sanborn said more than half of consumers don’t know the interest rates on their credit cards. Among those who claim to know their rates, half underestimate what they’re actually paying. The findings come from LendingClub’s internal research, as credit card interest rates have risen to the high-20% range while essential expenses continue to outpace income growth over the past two decades. Credit card revolving balances have reached record levels during this period. “Add in the inflationary pressure, which doesn’t seem to be going away as fast as anyone would like,” Sanborn told PYMNTS CEO Karen Webster during a Monday Conversation session. “It’s putting pressure on consumers, who are managing…but things are tight.” Sanborn said the conditions have created the largest total addressable market for personal loans that the company has seen. LendingClub estimates that 52% of Americans are currently carrying credit card debt at historically high interest rates. LendingClub began as a peer-to-peer lending platform in 2006 before acquiring Radius Bank in 2020. Sanborn said the bank acquisition was a key strategic move to empower consumers to make what he called “smart financial decisions” and transform the company’s operations into a comprehensive financial ecosystem. Following a strong second quarter reported at the end of July, the company reactivated key marketing channels that had been curtailed during interest rate shifts and the 2023 banking crisis. These channels include online advertising, display ads, paid search, and direct mail campaigns. “Our early results came in stronger than we expected,” Sanborn said, attributing the performance to the significant interest rate savings LendingClub can offer to consumers carrying high-rate credit card debt. LevelUp Checking launched just over a month ago with features designed to reward responsible financial behavior. The account offers 1% cash back on essential purchases, including gas, groceries, and pharmaceuticals, plus 1% annual percentage yield on account balances and 2% cash back for customers who make on-time loan payments. The cash back on loan payments effectively reduces the interest rate customers pay on their loans. Since the product launch, sign-ups increased sixfold compared to previous account opening rates. Approximately 60% of new checking accounts have come from existing borrowers who are setting up direct deposits and automated loan payments, indicating strong cross-selling success between LendingClub’s lending and banking operations. LevelUp Savings has attracted $2.7 billion in deposits in what Sanborn described as a short period. The savings product offers higher interest rates for customers who maintain consistent saving behavior over time. “These offerings are good for the consumer, better than the competition, and best when they’re used together,” Sanborn explained, referring to the integrated approach across checking, savings, and lending products. The banking product growth is being supported by what Sanborn called robust momentum in the company’s core lending businesses. Second-quarter loan originations rose 32% compared to the same period last year. The company attributed this growth to strong credit performance among existing loans and high demand from institutional loan buyers. LendingClub has maintained what Sanborn described as “a pretty cautious credit stance” that has contributed to more than four years of outperformance relative to competitors. The company’s current approval rates are approximately one-third lower than the levels maintained before inflation began affecting borrower finances. When the interest rate environment first shifted upward, asset management companies that had been buying loans from LendingClub’s marketplace moved to the sidelines because their cost of capital increased dramatically. “So we pivoted to banks,” Sanborn explained. “And we went upstream in terms of credit we were sourcing, because that’s what bank buyers want.” This pivot toward higher-quality borrowers proved beneficial when the 2023 banking crisis occurred. “Luckily we were ‘up’ credit at the time when inflationary pressures were also hitting borrowers,” Sanborn said. “That really benefited us and we’re selling that higher quality credit now to both banks and asset managers.” The conservative underwriting approach has enabled LendingClub to maintain strong loan performance even as economic conditions have created stress for many borrowers across the industry. In its core business of refinancing credit card debt, LendingClub directly pays off customers’ existing card balances rather than providing cash to borrowers. This process ensures the funds are used as intended for debt consolidation and prevents customers from accumulating additional debt on top of their new personal loan. “If you tell us you’re going to pay off your credit card debt, we say, great,” Sanborn explained. “Here are your cards…we will pay those directly for you.” This approach helps consumers reduce their overall cost of debt while maintaining the same total debt level, consolidating multiple credit card accounts into a single point of interaction through the LendingClub platform. LendingClub recently announced a significant partnership with BlackRock that includes a structured certificate product with an investment-grade rating from Fitch Ratings. Sanborn described BlackRock as a “blue chip counterpart” for the partnership. The BlackRock deal includes up to $1 billion in forward flow commitments for future loan purchases, initially targeting lower-cost capital sources such as insurance companies. This partnership is designed to help power LendingClub’s online marketplace for loan sales to institutional investors. Sanborn said these partnerships distinguish LendingClub from what he called “episodic entrants” in the lending market who “come in with guns blazing using inferred bureau models” without the depth of experience that comes from extended market presence. He noted that LendingClub has two decades of operating experience, dozens of internal credit models, and $100 billion in loan originations over 17 years of operations. This track record, according to Sanborn, provides advantages over newer competitors that rely primarily on standard credit bureau data and models. The company is developing what Sanborn called a proprietary “dynamic application” system that will control LendingClub’s full mobile technology stack. Unlike most banks that rely on third-party technology solutions, LendingClub’s internally controlled system is intended to enable more data-driven, customer-focused experiences. Additionally, the company is building a mobile marketing platform to support customer acquisition and engagement efforts. These technology investments are part of LendingClub’s broader strategy to differentiate its customer experience from traditional banking and lending competitors. “We’re really pleased with the progress we’re making,” Sanborn told Webster. “We’re very bullish on the future of LendingClub and we’re running ahead of our own expectations, which is great.” The company’s strong second-quarter performance and successful product launches have exceeded internal projections, according to Sanborn, positioning LendingClub for continued growth in what the CEO sees as an expanding market opportunity driven by consumer financial pressures and limited awareness of debt costs.

IRELAND’S LATEST RISING star in athletics, Conor Kelly, has confirmed he will follow in Rhasidat Adeleke’s footsteps by attending the University of Texas. Kelly collected his 400m gold medal at the European U20 championships today, having stormed to victory in yesterday’s race, clocking a new U20 national record of 45.83 seconds while he was at it. Speaking today to Athletics Ireland after stepping off the podium, Kelly said, “I couldn’t stop smiling, it was incredible. I was probably up a little later than I should’ve been. I woke up a little late, not much sleep…This is the last week before I go to Texas (for college) so I better get a good goodbye in.” Advertisement Kelly raced alongside Adeleke in the mixed 4x400m at the world relay championships in May. Today marked the final day of the championships in Tampere, Finland, with Sean Cronin (1500m) and the Irish women’s 4x100m relay team finishing eighth in their respective finals. Racing in a stacked, tactical 1500m final. Clonliffe Harriers clubman Cronin dug deep down the home straight to cross the line in 3:50.80. “I’m really proud of how I ran that race. I think I got as much out of it as I could have,” he told Athletics Ireland. “I’m delighted with the progression I’ve made this season, I think I’ve really stepped up. I’ve not just trained harder; I’ve trained smarter and done all the little things right in between.” An hour earlier, the Women’s 4x100m relay team of Fatima Amusan (Leevale AC), Molly Daly (Kilkenny City Harriers), Leila Colfer (St Laurence O’Toole AC) and Precious Akpe-Moses (Blackrock AC) clocked a time of 45.17 seconds in finishing eighth in their relay final, which was faster than their heat time. Akpe-Moses – who was racing at these championships for the eighth time, having made the finals of both the 100m and 200m – reflected on her performance and that of the team with pride. “It’s been a long championship,” she said. “We made it to the final, did what we could do, and we’re satisfied.” After a long two days of competition, Enya Silkena (Ratoath AC) finished 17th in the Women’s Heptathlon with 4693 points. Silkena was in action in the Long Jump (5.63m), Javelin Throw (39.48m) and 800m (2:30.19) today. Seamus Clarke (Moy Valley AC) was unable to finish the final of the Men’s 10,000m Race Walk due to injury.

Title: Ethereum surges with $461M ETF inflows – Will ETH break its ATH?

With BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale leading the buying spree, Ethereum’s breakout looks increasingly credible. Ethereum is gaining serious momentum as institutional ETF inflows surpass Bitcoin. Bullish metrics and rising open interest point to growing confidence in ETH, bringing it within an achievable distance of a new all-time high. Ethereum [ETH] just stole the spotlight from Bitcoin [BTC]. ETF inflows have flipped the usual script, on-chain trends are pointing up, and big players are quietly piling in. But will ETH be able to sustain this breakout and go further? ETFs are snapping up more Ethereum than Bitcoin, with a recent single-day haul of $461 million in ETH products compared to $404 million for BTC, according to Arkham Intelligence. Source: Arkham Intelligence The surge was led by institutional titans – BlackRock scooped up $250 million worth of ETH, Fidelity added $130 million, and Grayscale followed with $60 million. In fact, this was one of the strongest single-day institutional buying waves ETH has seen this year. Glassnode data revealed a sharp rise in first-time buyers and momentum traders, pushing new demand higher. Source: Glassnode Having said that, conviction buyers – those raising their cost basis despite elevated prices – also grew, signaling deeper market commitment. On top of that, this mix of fresh inflows and seasoned holder conviction could set the stage for an aggressive leg upward if buying pressure sustains. At press time, Ethereum’s derivatives market is heating up, with Futures Open Interest sitting at $51.61 billion – near a yearly high. Source: CoinGlass Price action remained strong despite a minor pullback, with ETH trading at $4,190, above its 9- and 21-day EMAs. Momentum indicators added to the bullish bias: RSI hovered just below overbought territory at 69.8, while MACD remained firmly positive. Source: TradingView With less than $700 to reclaim its $4,891 all-time high, ETH’s current structure suggests a shot at price discovery this year. Of course, profit-taking could slow the climb before any decisive breakout. Disclaimer: AMBCrypto's content is meant to be informational in nature and should not be interpreted as investment advice.

Title: Inside the mind of Lyn Alden: Bitcoin, AI, and the unstoppable deficit train

Renowned macro analyst Lyn Alden shares her views on fiscal deficits, 'sticky' inflation, Bitcoin cycles, and the remarkable 20-watt human brain. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Welcome to Slate Sundays, CryptoSlate’s new weekly feature showcasing in-depth interviews, expert analysis, and thought-provoking op-eds that go beyond the headlines to explore the ideas and voices shaping the future of crypto. Lyn Alden is an exceptional human. Broadly recognized as one of the top minds in macroeconomics, during a conversation with Lyn, you can feel some of her vast intellect rubbing off on you; I swear my IQ increased several points by the time our chat was over. Even navigating heavy topics like the fiscal deficit and the onset of AI, she does so with a smile on her face and more eloquence and poise than an Olympic gymnast executing a triple backflip. Founder of Lyn Alden Investment Strategy and general partner at venture firm Ego Death Capital, alongside other industry heavyweights like Jeff Booth and Preston Pysh, Lyn has earned her stripes over the years as one of the most respected macro analysts in the space. She’s also one of the most solicited for interviews, thanks to her razor-sharp insights and depth of market knowledge. As a prolific content creator, Lyn offers a free investing newsletter and frequents the virtual corridors of Crypto Twitter daily, amassing three-quarters of a million followers who rely on her timely commentary and finely-edged wit: beyond the undeniable words of wisdom and investment advice, Lyn’s something of a master when it comes to memes. Lyn is perhaps best known for her book Broken Money, which provides a comprehensive view of the history of money and a well-illustrated critique of the global monetary system. She’s also highly vocal about her thesis on the U.S. fiscal deficit, AKA, ‘Nothing stops this train’. Sky-high levels of U.S. spending are rising at a pace that far outstrips the government’s ability to pay for it, creating what Lyn dubs a “slow-motion runaway train.” She explains: “Large U.S. fiscal deficits are going to continue for the foreseeable future, five, 10 years, any sort of investable time horizon. There are a bunch of reasons why, and a lot of them have to do with political polarization. It’s very hard to either massively raise taxes or massively cut spending in a very polarized situation, as well as mechanically the kind of debt levels they find themselves in.” The total amount of money the U.S. government owes to its lenders currently amounts to an eye-watering $36.9 trillion, representing over 120% of GDP, and growing by around $1 trillion every quarter. Even the most highly skilled ringmaster with smoke and mirrors would struggle to obfuscate such an alarming level of federal debt. With a diminishing ability to pay it off, I wonder, if nothing stops this train, can anything slow it down? She replies: “There are plenty of things that can slow it down a little bit. Tariffs are one of the things that can slow it down because they bypass some of that polarization. Tariffs are basically really big tax hikes that go around Congress because of an emergency authorization executive order, so they temporarily bypass some of the frictions against them.” While tariffs may serve to fill the government coffers a little higher, Lyn says the numbers don’t add up enough to make a significant impact: the deficit is around $2 trillion, and the income from tariffs at the current level only equates to roughly a quarter of it at around $500 billion a year. Plus, “we’re already seeing exemptions.” She adds: “The last line for the ‘Nothing stops this train’ view is that the U.S. is very financialized, meaning that our government’s tax receipts are very correlated with asset prices. Any attempts at austerity at this point tend to fail to address the problem because you either slow down the stock market or slow down the economy. Therefore, with a lag, you weaken your other tax receipts and make deficit reduction on a sustained basis hard.” I nod, contemplating the enormity of the situation and the inevitable collision course the economy is on. She continues: “Just structurally, it’s growing above target almost without any way to stop it.” We turn the conversation to last week’s market slump following a weaker-than-expected jobs report that triggered former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes to sell off a chunk of his crypto holdings. I ask Lyn how significant the jobs report is and whether she echoes Hayes’ bearish near-term views on global liquidity. She frowns, pointing out that Hayes is more of a frequent trader than she is, however: “The jobs report was pretty significant. It was the biggest downward revision in quite a while, and it’s corroborated by other things as well. The ISM Purchasing Managers’ indices are also showing a similar directional weakness.” The ISM Manufacturing PMI is a key indicator of the state of the U.S. economy as it signals the level of demand for products by measuring the amount of ordering activity at U.S. factories. Lyn continues: “Now, whether that affects Bitcoin and broader crypto, I’m more hesitant to say. While it can slow down earnings that can impair the economy in various ways, it also generally means more Fed dovishness, which, around the margins, is good for Bitcoin and crypto.” Despite not making short-term trading decisions like Hayes, Lyn gives some credence to his outlook over the coming quarters based on a couple of parameters: Tariffs may make a dent in the deficit and serve to take the wind out of crypto’s sails (“slightly slower the train for a couple of quarters”), and the treasury is attempting to refill its general cash account (the TGA) after the debt ceiling was passed. That means sucking liquidity out of the system, which can negatively impact risk assets. Lyn explains: “Ironically, debt ceilings, when they’re an issue, are actually good for liquidity because they force all these pockets of liquidity to go back into the market, but then afterward, when they refill their cash levels, they’re pulling cash out of the system. They [the treasury] expect to do that through the rest of this quarter, to Arthur’s point, which is historically not amazing for asset prices across the board.” In contrast, Lyn isn’t too worried about a broader tightening of global liquidity. She says: “I would say liquidity’s in a middling place because the dollar is no longer falling as it was earlier this year, and the dollar is a really big variable for liquidity, generally. A falling dollar is overall good for global liquidity. At the other end of the spectrum, China’s credit impulse is on the upswing, which is good for global liquidity. So it’s kind of neutral at the current time.” While it’s not the perfect setup for a million-dollar Bitcoin, things could definitely be worse. Lyn affirms: “I don’t think this cycle’s over yet. I think we’re going to see higher highs in Bitcoin this cycle. That could be later this year. That could be early next year. There are lots of little variables that can affect that, but so far, we don’t see any indicators that look like a multi-year top.” In fact, she explains that we’re “nowhere near multi-year tops” based on various indicators that track market value compared to on-chain cost basis, a “kind of a measure of euphoria.” “I think liquidity still looks decent, maybe not great for a quarter, but it’s not an acute headwind per se, in my opinion, and going into next year, I still think we’re going to see most likely higher Bitcoin prices.” How high is that? Lyn pauses and says she has no firm view. Unlike other personalities in the space, she doesn’t win over more followers by making outlandish predictions. Instead, she simply says: “I think we’re going over $150k this cycle. Now the number could be much higher than that, but I always try to start conservatively, and it depends on market conditions at that time.” She believes that Bitcoin cycles are changing, and we should expect this one to be longer and “maybe less extreme” than previous runs. We should also prepare to see strong moves upward followed by periods of consolidation, “rather than going to the moon and collapsing.” “If you look at what used to be called FANG stocks, and now it’s the Mag7 stocks, basically large-cap U.S. tech stocks, they kept grinding up longer than people thought. Value investors were always shocked that these things just kept growing. “Sometimes they get over their skis and have a 30% correction, sometimes worse. Sometimes they have a flattish, choppy year, but then they keep grinding higher after they work out some steam. I think Bitcoin could resemble that model to some extent. Maybe it’s still more volatile than that, but I do think we should expect maybe longer and less extreme cycles on average.” For anyone who’s been flushed out by a Mt. Gox, China ban, or FTX-style black swan event that abruptly reversed most of Bitcoin’s gains, Lyn’s prediction may provide some relief. But is there any potential catalyst for the end of the cycle quietly chirping away like a canary in a coal mine? Bitcoin treasury companies, for example? Lyn points out that now that Bitcoin is a multitrillion-dollar asset, it’s inevitable that smart money flows in. She says: “There’s no world in which only individuals own Bitcoin and magically no large pools of capital want to own it. That only makes sense when Bitcoin is a tiny market.” She’s not concerned about the centralization threat to Bitcoin posed by entities like Strategy gobbling up BTC like it’s going out of style (Strategy’s BTC holdings currently stand at over 628,791, just shy of 3% of the entire supply). She simply shrugs and says it’s no different from previous cycles: “At one point, Mt. Gox supposedly had over 800,000 coins, and there were fewer coins back then. So that was a bigger percentage of coins than, say, BlackRock or Strategy has now. So while there’s always some degree of centralization concerns, it’s really not worse now than it was at periods of times in the past. So, no. I’m not really worried about that from a centralization perspective.” What is important to be on the lookout for, Lyn explains, is the amount of leverage in the system, since “any degree of euphoria and leverage is what causes the next downward cycle.” Bitcoin needs upward volatility to go from zero to trillions of dollars of value and become relevant on a global scale; and upward volatility, Lyn warns, breeds euphoria and leverage. “That’s when you get over your skis and you get consolidations and downside volatility. There are obviously other liquidations that happen from time to time, so they certainly could feed the next downturn, but I don’t view it as fundamentally different from prior cycles, and the current leverage in the treasury space is not that high. MicroStrategy has pretty low leverage relative to their Bitcoin. Metaplanet has relatively low leverage relative to their Bitcoin. We’ll see how the others come as they go. I certainly think that we’ll see a washout. We’ll see a lot of altcoin treasury companies get washed out, and some Bitcoin ones that are poorly managed are going to be at risk in the next downturn.” It was sometime during the COVID lockdowns that Lyn began discussing the persistent inflation that would stem from shuttering the world and inflating the money supply. She would later characterize the 2020s as the decade of inflation, as governments struggle to rein in rising costs. Does Lyn expect this trend to continue? “To some extent, I mean, we’re in 2025. We’re still above the way the Fed measures inflation. We’re still above their official target even though it has come down. Now, whether or not we have another dramatic spike comes partially down to whether energy is constrained or not. It’s pretty hard to have major inflation without energy suppression, so anything that keeps the supply of energy high is a way of keeping inflation down.” Unlike previous decades, she says, where we were able to print money and offset it with productivity gains from automating manufacturing, she sees the 2020s as “stickier” in terms of average inflation; unless we realize a major productivity increase through a technology such as AI, although even that won’t bring down the cost of store-of-value assets. She says: “The things that are truly scarce, like waterfront property, gold, fine art, high-quality stocks, and things like that, all go up dramatically because it’s hard to increase those things. So I think going forward, AI making, say, white collar types of services cheaper can suppress in some way CPI and certain wages and expenditures that people have. This could be offset by ongoing money printing, higher gold, higher Bitcoin, higher prestige properties, and just truly scarce things. So I do think that we’re still in a sticky inflation environment, even though it’s hard to get dramatic inflation without energy shortages.” Since she’s brought up AI for its productivity gains, I ask if she’s concerned about job losses and whether she believes it’s a net positive for humanity, being something of an AI skeptic myself. Lyn’s markedly more optimistic. Just like the runaway fiscal deficit train, she says AI is inevitable. “At this stage, if you try to ban it in one country, another will do it, and it will be open-sourced in some capacity. Like any technology, it can be disruptive when it hits; a lot of people can lose their jobs at once.” She likens AI to social media in the way the latter disrupted social interaction, and warns that it must be used carefully to avoid doing more harm than good. I recall reading an MIT study, to her point, that found AI to be a great learning tool; as long as people didn’t become so dependent on it that their intelligence drained away like blood from an open wound. Lyn continues: “It’s a good thing that we find ways to make repetitive white-collar work cheaper and more affordable because that allows those people or future generations to do other types of work, which is true for any time we automated textiles or farming with tractors and hydrocarbons and things like that. It’s the same thing except it’s quicker.” She points out that portable AI is different from data center AI and marvels at the mechanics of the human brain: our ability to process complex thoughts and emotions, “very high bandwidth senses,” and “self-healing” capability run on just 20 watts of power. She enthuses: “It’s remarkable. It’s less than an incandescent light bulb. The equivalent amount of processing in a data center runs on megawatts of power, so millions of watts of power… I don’t think we’re anywhere near the level where there’s nothing humans could do to add value over silicon. I think it’s more a case of disruption that then puts more people into doing other things.” I nod, wondering whether my metaphorical lightbulb requires as much energy as Lyn Alden’s giant brain. With persistent inflation, societal disruption, and broken money, to boot, this era bears all the hallmarks of a fourth turning, and I struggle to feel positive about where it all ends. I wonder what Lyn thinks. Is this a good time to be alive? She ponders: “I think so. Fewer people die from avoidable things than almost ever before globally. It’s not an accident that the population bubble is happening now… For the most part, I consider it good, but it goes through waves of getting too much, like when people get cut off from social connections. People have way more depression now than hunter-gatherers, even though in most capacities, we live longer and are less likely to die from something random… Technology is polarizing because, in some ways, it becomes like a winner-take-most, and to the extent that we get through this whole thing successfully, I think we have to learn to use technology in a more natural way than be so reliant on it. I think eventually that will be the case.” Lyn also believes that AI won’t continue to develop and improve ad infinitum, but will eventually hit a plateau, just like aviation did: progress within that industry has been fairly stagnant for years, following its mind-blowing takeoff in the 20th Century. She says: “We went from the Wright brothers to people on the moon in one human lifetime. But then, once we hit the 70s, we slowed down. We still don’t have a jet faster than the Blackbird. We still don’t have commercial aviation faster than the Concorde. We don’t even have that anymore… I think in time, similar things will happen to electronics where we’ll reach certain densities that are hard to keep dramatically improving on, and it will allow us more time to absorb what we already have.” Follow Lyn Alden on X or check out lynalden.com for in-depth analysis and insights.

Title: Futures-Based SOL & XRP ETFs Take In $1 Billion Capital Since Launch — Spot ETFs Next?

The cryptocurrency industry has been about hitting new milestones in 2025, with the futures-based Solana and XRP ETFs (exchange-traded funds) among the latest to reach new achievements. According to the latest market data, the SOL and XRP ETFs have reached $1 billion in total capital inflows since their launch earlier. This feat comes on the back of rumors that the world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock, might look to launch a spot XRP-based exchange-traded fund. In an August 9 post on the X platform, the president of The ETF Store, Nate Geraci, revealed that the futures-based Solana and XRP ETFs have attracted over $1 billion in capital since launch. These crypto-linked investment products started trading in the United States about five months ago—around March (for SOL ETF) and April (for XRP). For context, futures-based exchange-traded funds are a type of investment product that holds the futures contracts of an asset. A futures contract is a financial instrument that allows an investor to buy an asset at a predetermined price on a predetermined date. In March 2025, Volatility Shares launched the first-ever Solana exchange-traded funds in the United States. The firm rolled out two products at the time: Volatility Shares’ Solana fund, which replicates the performance of Solana futures, and the 2x SOL ETF that offers double-leveraged exposure. While Teucrium launched the first US-based XRP ETF (a 2x leveraged fund) in April, Volatility Shares offered the first non-leveraged futures-based XRP exchange-traded fund in May. As shown in the chart below, both the SOL and XRP ETFs had posted only modest monthly performances up until July—where they each posted approximately $350 million in capital inflows. Geraci noted that these figures include REX-Osprey’s Solana staking exchange-traded fund, which boasts up to $150 million in assets under management. According to the ETF expert, this performance proves that there will be demand for spot SOL and XRP ETFs. It is worth mentioning that a slew of applications from various asset managers are awaiting approval from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch Solana and XRP ETFs. As reported by Bitcoinist, BlackRock has indicated that it currently has no plans to join the race for spot Solana and XRP ETFs. In a second post on X, Geraci reiterated his belief that BlackRock would be looking to expand its crypto ETF portfolio. “And I’m being told BlackRock doesn’t want a piece of this?” the ETF expert said, referring to the attention being enjoyed by the future-based version of the XRP exchange-traded fund.

Title: U.S. Spot XRP ETFs: Five Possible Reasons Behind BlackRock’s Hesitation to File for One

BlackRock has made bold moves into bitcoin and ether ETFs, but on Friday, the asset manager said it had no immediate plans to file for a spot XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF), dashing the community’s hopes that its entry could help extend XRP’s 2025 rally. This statement — made the day after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple Labs jointly asked an appeals court to dismiss their respective appeals, signaling an end to their nearly five-year legal battle — has left investors questioning why BlackRock remains on the sidelines. While several asset managers, including ProShares, Grayscale, and Bitwise, have filed for XRP ETFs since late 2024, BlackRock’s absence is notable, especially given its dominance in the bitcoin and ether ETF markets. Here are five reasons why BlackRock appears in no hurry to launch a spot XRP ETF, despite the XRP community’s anticipation of a demand-driven price surge. First, BlackRock has cited limited client interest in cryptocurrencies beyond BTC and ETH. Back in March 2024, Robert Mitchnick, the asset manager's head of digital assets, said that there's a misconception that BlackRock will have a "long tail" of other crypto services. "I can say that for our client base, bitcoin is overwhelmingly the No. 1 focus and a little bit ethereum," he said during a fireside chat at the inaugural Bitcoin Investor Day conference in New York on March 22. Second, BlackRock’s strategic caution around regulatory uncertainty plays a role. Although XRP sales on public exchanges are deemed non-securities, the broader regulatory framework for altcoins remains murky. BlackRock may be waiting for clearer SEC guidelines before entering the altcoin ETF space. The firm’s conservative approach contrasts with competitors like ProShares, which filed for a spot XRP ETF in January 2025 alongside leveraged and futures-based XRP ETFs, the latter tracking XRP futures contracts rather than the token’s spot price. Third, BlackRock may see diminishing returns in pursuing a spot XRP ETF given the crowded field. As of August 2025, at least seven firms, including Grayscale, Franklin Templeton and 21Shares, have a pending spot XRP ETF application. Fourth, the XRP community’s expectations of a price surge may not align with BlackRock’s data-driven strategy. Polymarket odds for the SEC approving a spot XTP ETF in 2025 stand at 77%. BlackRock's tokenized money market fund on Ethereum and Solana shows blockchain interest, but XRP’s smaller market footprint may not justify the operational costs of a new ETF. Finally, BlackRock’s global perspective prioritizes markets where XRP demand is less pronounced. While the XRP community, active on platforms like X, anticipates a spot ETF driving demand, much of XRP’s trading volume comes from Asia, where BlackRock’s ETF presence is less dominant. At press time, XRP was trading around $3.1852, down 3.92% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinDesk Data.

Title: BlackRock Says XRP And SOL ETFs Not In The Cards Despite Long-Running Ripple-SEC Case Officially Ending

The conclusive end of Ripple’s nearly five-year-long lawsuit indicated the possibility for Wall Street titans such as BlackRock to file to introduce a spot XRP exchange-traded fund. BlackRock, however, has clarified that it has no immediate plans to offer a potential XRP ETF or Solana (SOL) fund. “At this time, BlackRock does not have any plans to file an XRP or SOL ETF,” a BlackRock representative reportedly told The Block on Friday. The clarification came shortly after NovaDius Wealth President Nate Geraci suggested that BlackRock would eventually foray into the XRP ETF market as the Securities and Exchange Commission and Ripple have officially ended their five-year legal battle after jointly withdrawing their appeals in the XRP case. As ZyCrypto reported earlier, the Second Circuit Appeals Court recognized the filing, with both parties bearing their own legal fees. According to Geraci, it’s hard to justify overlooking crypto assets beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, but if BlackRock avoids issuing other crypto ETFs, they’re basically stating that only BTC and ETH are worth investing in. “Otherwise, they’re basically saying btc & eth are only ones that will ever have value. Bold,” the pundit added. Geraci noted in a follow-up post that futures-based SOL and XRP exchange-traded funds went live in March and April, respectively, and have since pulled in more than $1 billion in new investor money. While less impactful on price than a spot fund, he believes this is a sign that spot XRP and Solana ETFs, once approved, will attract “real demand.” And I’m being told BlackRock doesn’t want a piece of this?Ok. Asset managers, including ProShares, WisdomTree, 21Shares, Canary, and Bitwise, have all submitted paperwork with the SEC for a potential XRP ETF. In June, analysts at Bloomberg upped their odds of spot XRP, Dogecoin, and Cardano ETF approvals getting launched before the end of 2025 to 90%. Meanwhile, Canada is a step ahead. 3iQ’s spot XRP ETFs, XRPQ and XRPQ.U, started trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange in mid-June, swiftly accumulating roughly $50 million in assets under management, the company proclaimed in a post on X.

Title: What investing in private equity and crypto means for your 401(k)

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Your 401(k) options could change soon. President Donald Trump signed an executive order Thursday to clear the way for Americans to invest their retirement savings in private equity, cryptocurrency, real estate and other alternative assets. It’s a big win for the asset industry — giving financial managers access to some of the $12.2 trillion in Americans’ 401(k) and related retirement plans. Private assets can also be more lucrative, and the Trump administration said they can give retirement savers more opportunities. “The theoretical benefits are that everyday Americans can invest in a broader menu of companies,” said Robert Brokamp, a financial planning expert at stock market research company The Motley Fool. But there are higher risks — and not necessarily higher rewards. Critics say it could put people in danger of losing a huge chunk of their retirement savings. “There is a lot less transparency and liquidity in private markets,” said Brokamp. “There’s not as much information about the companies, and it could be hard to sell your investments — especially during a panic and many, many investors are trying to sell at the same time.” Plus the fees are higher for private assets than for typical 401(k) investments like mutual funds and ETFs. Benjamin Schiffrin, director of securities policy at Better Markets, said target-date mutual funds holding stocks and bonds charge 0.3% — while private funds can charge 1% to 2% in management fees and up to 20% in performance fees, and interval funds charge 2% to 3%. Right now, private equity is technically allowed in retirement plans, but it’s rare — though some companies like BlackRock are planning new offerings. There are ways people can invest in crypto through their 401(k)s, too, but it’s also not common. And many 401(k) recordkeepers don’t support private equity funds yet. The executive order could change that. It directs the Department of Labor to re-examine its guidance and clarify its position on alternative assets like private market investments, real estate interests and digital assets within 180 days. And it tells the Securities and Exchange Commission to consider ways to facilitate access to alternative assets for plans like 401(k)s. “I think this is going to open the floodgates,” said Schiffrin. “I think up until now, you’ve actually seen a lot of hesitancy on the part of 401(k) plan managers to go down the road of including private market assets like private equity and private credit, things like that in the 401(k) plans.” Employers would have to decide to offer the plans — and experts anticipate many might be reluctant, as they could be held liable for losses. However, with updated guidance from the government, employers may feel more comfortable adding these alternative assets into their 401(k)s. Many experts say that might not be a good thing. SageMint Wealth managing partner Anh Tran, a certified financial planner and attorney, believes there’s a real risk that some investors will be drawn in by the allure of potentially higher returns from alternative investments without having the full picture. She said she would not advise anyone to make this kind of investment unless they fully understand the risk of losing that money entirely. “It could be detrimental to less-informed investors whose only investment account is their 401(k),” said Tran. “Without proper guardrails, such as limiting exposure to 5% to 10% of the portfolio, these investors could be exposed to unnecessary risk, misaligned expectations and potentially irreversible losses.” Knut Rostad, co-founder and president of the nonprofit Institute for the Fiduciary Standard, also fears private assets in 401(k)s could put retirement savers at risk of big losses. “I think in practice, there’ll be many fiduciaries who ignore this directive because they understand precisely what will result from it,” he said, referring to Trump’s executive order. “The result will be a massive train wreck where many people are seriously hurt. Their retirement accounts will be annihilated.” And cryptocurrencies come with their own dangers. “It’s not clear what, if any, protections investors are going to have when it comes to investing in crypto,” said Better Markets’ Schiffrin. “So that just is a whole separate category of risks that having crypto in 401(k)s opens up.” Meanwhile the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, a trade organization for broker-dealers, investment banks and asset managers, cheered the announcement as a win for retirement savers. “As more U.S. companies choose to remain non-public, private markets have developed into a more robust asset class,” Kenneth E. Bentsen Jr., president and CEO of SIFMA, said in a statement. “Access to such investments, however, has been limited primarily to institutional and high net worth investors.” He continued: “Policy changes to expand access to private markets investments — appropriately tailored under ERISA and SEC rules — could serve to improve diversification, democratize access, and offer more investment choices to the benefit of everyday retirement savers.” Experts believe it could take months to see any changes. For now, they say education and safeguards are key — especially for younger investors and people without access to professional financial advice. “There must be transparency, education and limits in place to prevent widespread harm,” said Tran. “Otherwise, we could be setting the stage for not only ﬁnancial loss, but broader economic and social consequences.” Kayla Steinberg is a producer at NBC News covering business and the economy.

Title: Bitcoin Bulls In Control: $120,000 Test Could Trigger Run Toward ATH

Bitcoin (BTC) prices are currently hovering near $118,000 after a modest price recovery in the last week resulted in a 4.17% price gain. With a new week ahead, a top market analyst with X username KillaXBT shares some technical insights on the present Bitcoin market structure and also discusses potential price developments. Related Reading: Harvard Reveals $117M BlackRock Bitcoin ETF Stake In SEC Filing – Details In an X post on August 9, KillaXBT gives a weekly analysis report of the Bitcoin price’s movement for the first week in August while also sharing future projections. In their observations, the market expert notes that Bitcoin started the month on a strong technical footing, flipping the monthly open at $115,752 into support, a move traders often interpret as a bullish signal. However, KillaXBT explains that Bitcoin historically tends to wick either up or down in a new month, forming one side of the monthly candle’s wick in a pattern sometimes referred to by traders as the “monthly open trap.” Therefore, the current setup has market watchers closely monitoring for either a sustained uptrend or a liquidity-driven retracement before continuation. In terms of liquidity, the crypto analyst has also observed that significant 2-week BTC liquidations are building above the $120,000 mark. This zone is also aligned with the previous weekly open ($119,414), creating a high-probability target should bullish structure remain intact. At present, BTC is testing a lower-timeframe (LTF) downtrend line. KillaXBT explains that a confirmed break above this trendline could pave the way for a decisive move toward $120,000 and beyond, while traders remain wary of potential liquidity hunts that could briefly push price lower before resuming the uptrend. Two main scenarios are now emerging for traders. First, BTC could maintain its bullish structure, continuing the climb toward the $120,000 liquidity pool and potentially targeting the $123,186 monthly high (ATH). This path aligns with the current technical structure, which shows no immediate signs of bearish continuation. Alternatively, Bitcoin could fail to break higher, instead forming a lower high and slipping back under $115,700. In such a case, the next major support lies in the $110,000–$112,000 range, marked by the monthly fair value gap (FVG) at $111,955. Presently, KillaXBT believes scenario one appears more likely as the market is holding bullish momentum, and with absent clear bearish signals, the analyst expects BTC to attempt higher highs in the coming days. However, traders should also expect BTC could briefly dip early in the week, particularly Monday or Tuesday, to clear overleveraged long positions before rallying. In rounding off, the market expert states a sustained pattern of higher highs and higher lows on intraday charts would further validate the bullish outlook, while a failure to hold these levels could quickly shift sentiment toward the bearish alternative. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $117,792 following a 1.11% gain in the last day. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: BlackRock Confirms No Current XRP Or Solana Spot ETF Filings

BlackRock has confirmed that the company is not currently pursuing spot ETFs for Ripple’s XRP or Solana, despite market rumors. While the XRP and SOL communities may be disappointed by the lack of immediate action, the acknowledgment from BlackRock validates their relevance in the broader crypto market. In a recent update from The Block, BlackRock has clarified that the company currently has no plans to file for spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tied to Ripple’s XRP or SOL. This aligns with BlackRock’s cautious approach, as reflected in earlier comments from executives like CEO Larry Fink and CIO Samara Cohen. Both have emphasized their focus on Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs for now. According to MartyParty, the world’s largest asset manager noted that they are actively exploring assets like SOL and XRP for potential future offerings rather than spot ETFs. However, the industry speculation, fueled by analysts like Nate Geraci, suggests that BlackRock could consider filing for SOL and XRP Ripple spot ETFs by an October 2025 deadline. This potential move is believed to be driven by mounting competitive pressures in the crypto ETF space and recent regulatory developments. These include the SEC’s approval of in-kind creation and redemption mechanisms, which enhance the efficiency of ETF operations. Furthermore, no official filings have been made yet, and any decision to proceed would likely depend on regulatory clarity. While the ongoing speculation that BlackRock could consider filing for SOL and XRP, an analyst known as Web3BPP has also revealed that Ripple has officially closed its nearly five-year legal battle with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Web3BPP stated that the court has confirmed that XRP sales on secondary markets are not securities transactions. According to the expert, this news has sent the altcoin’s price up by 11% reaching $3.33, capping off a remarkable 31% monthly gain and an impressive nearly 500% increase over the past year. Analysts are now setting their sights on $8 short-term price target for XRP, while some long-term forecasts envision prices soaring as high as $1,000 by 2030, due to their belief that BlackRock could consider filing for a spot XRP ETF by October. A move expected to bring in billions of dollars in fresh institutional capital. The expert also drew attention to Ethereum, which has gained 7% this week, reaching $3,908, driven largely by whale buying and expanding adoption by corporate treasuries. This surge reflects growing confidence in ETH as both a store of value and a strategic asset for businesses. Market experts are bullish on ETH’s future, with many projecting a price target of $5,000 by the end of the year. This rally is expected to be supported by interest in ETH-based ETFs and upcoming network upgrades designed to enhance performance and security. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: BlackRock To File For XRP ETF After Ripple-SEC Settlement? Market Expert Answers

Ripple Labs and the US SEC have finally closed the book on their high-profile lawsuit after almost five years of legal back-and-forth. According to a joint filing with the Second Circuit Court of Appeals on Thursday, both sides agreed to drop their appeals, making Judge Analisa Torres’s 2023 ruling final. The resolution has already been factored into XRP’s price surge above $3 again. It has also led to an interesting speculation from market expert Nate Geraci, who suggested that BlackRock may now look to file for an iShares XRP ETF. The end of the case immediately prompted discussion about whether BlackRock, Wall Street’s biggest asset manager, will launch a Spot XRP ETF. Geraci, president of The ETF Store, shared on X that he believes BlackRock may have been waiting for this moment before filing for an iShares XRP ETF. “Makes zero sense for them to ignore crypto assets beyond btc & eth,” he wrote. According to him, limiting exposure to just Bitcoin and Ethereum would be like saying they’re the only assets that will ever matter. That stance is very questionable given the altcoin’s price performance since last year. Given BlackRock’s success with its Spot Bitcoin and Spot Ethereum ETFs, the XRP ETF is the logical next step, as the third-largest cryptocurrency. If BlackRock were to launch an XRP ETF, it could be a game-changer for the token’s price performance. At the time of writing, BlackRock holds the largest share of assets in both Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in the US. The firm’s Spot Bitcoin ETF, iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), has dominated inflows since launch and is currently holding $86.53 billion in net assets. Furthermore, its iShares Ethereum Trust has quickly become the leader among Ethereum ETFs with $12.35 billion in net assets. Polymarket now puts the odds of an XRP ETF approval at 76%, although it reached as high as 88.7% on August 8. However, Bloomberg’s ETF analyst Eric Balchunas is leaning on the cautious side. In response to Nate Geraci’s post, Balchunas disagreed and noted that the firm is likely satisfied with its existing crypto offerings. He doesn’t expect one to be filed this year, but the longer-term outlook is harder to call. It appears BlackRock is in no rush to expand its ETF lineup for now. A BlackRock spokesperson told The Block on Friday that the company currently has no plans for a spot XRP ETF, or one for Solana. However, that doesn’t mean the door is closed forever. XRP’s price jumped more than 11% on the news of the settlement. Its price went from $3.04 and jumped to $3.36 in just a few hours after news of the settlement broke out. At the time of writing, the altcoin is trading at $3.32. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Tokens that are designed to be digital twins of stocks have subtle differences that make them less identical and more fraternal to the securities they're supposed to replicate. Tokenization was theoretical when BlackRock chief Larry Fink publicly discussed it in early 2024, but has landed in the real world via popular trading platforms including Robinhood (HOOD), Kraken and Coinbase Global (COIN). While they haven't cleared regulatory hurdles for U.S. investors' yet, rollouts of stock tokens in Europe started in June, ratcheting up the competition between trading venues that offer, or plan to offer, them to their customers. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, who unveiled the crypto exchange's tokenization ambitions in late July, quantified the business case for it: Just 3% in equities trading market share would double the current crypto market. "We've always said we're updating the system and building the bridge to bring equities on to crypto rails is the next phase of our strategy," he said. Anything can be made into tokens, from mortgage contracts representing real estate to shares in special purpose vehicles (SPVs) that reference the price of the underlying assets—whether they are publicly traded stocks or stakes in private companies, the latter of which made headlines when Robinhood unveiled OpenAI and SpaceX stock tokens. Robinhood chief Vlad Tenev, during the company's recent earnings call, said that the true opportunity in tokenization is in inaccessible assets like private market assets, according to a transcript provided by AlphaSense. He also said there was a "very positive" reception to stock tokens. "It's clear customers want this," he said. "They not only want it in Europe but they want it in the U.S. as well." OpenAI, the ChatGPT maker, has publicly said that it was not associated with the OpenAI stock tokens launched by Robinhood. The private-asset "stock tokens" weren't technically equity, but derivative contracts. Kraken, the U.S.'s oldest crypto exchange, has taken a different tack to tokenization. It partnered with a company called Backed to roll out xStocks. They trade on Solana and BNB Chain, but will likely show up on other blockchains as the so-called xStocks Alliance, a network of exchanges and decentralized finance protocols, grows. Kraken's consumer business chief Mark Greenberg, in an interview with Investopedia, said that the exchange's stock tokens aren't derivatives, but "actually backed by real stocks." As Greenberg explained it: Its partner Backed runs an SPV in New Jersey that holds stocks, and for each stock an investor buys, they mint a corresponding token, which they destroy when the underlying stock is sold, and the cash value given to the user. They are not technically equity but debt instruments that grant their holders the right to the cash value of the underlying shares, but not the shares themselves. Kraken hopes to eventually enable XStocks holders to redeem the underlying assets rather than their cash value, Greenberg said. Coinbase may come up with a whole different model, but the crypto exchange has not yet set a timeline. That said, U.S. securities regulators appear to be more receptive to them than they were in the past.

Trump signing the long-rumored order has boosted the bitcoin price, pushing it toward $120,000 per bitcoin for the first time since last month, while ethereum has surged 21% this week, breaking back above $4,000 per ether for the first time since December last year. XRP, one of the best performing major cryptocurrencies over the last year with a near 500% gain, has climbed 12% this week, helping the combined crypto market top $4 trillion. “This could mark a major milestone in bringing digital assets into the mainstream financial infrastructure, opening the door to long-term adoption by everyday Americans,” Anthony Agoshkov, cofounder of Marvel Capital, said in emailed comments. The order gives the Department of Labor 180 days to review rules with any changes not expected to be seen immediately in bitcoin and crypto markets. “The Trump executive order opening the door to the inclusion of crypto and private assets in 401(k) retirement plans opens the way to greater choice and gives investors more options," Katalin Tischhauser, head of research at Sygnum Bank, said via email. “It is another bullish driver for the crypto market as the relatively small market capitalisation means fund flows can have a significant impact on price." In May, the Department of Labor scrapped guidance from 2022 that urged "extreme care" before any investment companies added crypto to retirement account options. “The announcement has fueled optimism around future institutional inflows, especially given the size of the U.S. defined contribution market, which totals around $10 trillion," Joel Kruger, market strategist at LMAX Group, said in emailed comments. "A more favorable regulatory tone is taking shape in Washington. The Trump executive order follows a series of signals from lawmakers aimed at establishing clearer guardrails around digital asset classification and access.” While there is currently no prohibition on retirement plan operators adding these types of investments, the order is expected to result in a more diverse range of options for people. “This order isn’t about the government saying 'crypto belongs in 401(k)s.’ It’s about the government getting out of the way and letting people make their own decisions,” Matt Hougan, chief investment officer at Bitwise, said in an emailed note.

Both assets are now pressing against key technical boundaries where momentum could either accelerate or stall sharply." Bitcoin and crypto market watchers remain bullish for the rest of 2025, however, some are warning the bitcoin price and crypto market could crash next year. “My view is that once we complete the bull cycle at circa $140,000-$145,000, we will see a corrective bear market in 2026, but I am not looking for a deep correct, but likely a move to $90,000 to $100,000,” John Glover, chief investment officer of Ledn, said in emailed comments, adding: “I know this goes against the popular view that we are going to hit the extreme prognosticator’s views of $250,000, $500,000, or even $1 million in 2025 or 2026." Meanwhile, Trump also signed a separate executive order targeting the “debanking” of people and businesses on political grounds, which will “ensure that Federal regulators do not promote policies and practices that allow financial institutions to deny or restrict services based on political beliefs, religious beliefs or lawful business activities, ensuring fair access to banking for all Americans.” The "digital assets industry has also been the target of unfair debanking initiatives," according to a White House fact sheet, with Caitlin Long, the chief executive of crypto-focused Custodia Bank, cheering the addition of the Small Business Administration as an overseer of the federal banking regulators.

For those familiar with the crypto-space, it’s clear that Ethereum (ETH) holds the record as the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency. Better still, it made headlines late 2021 when it reached the ATH of $4,000, making a FOMO to set in as no one, including institutional and retail markets, wanted to be left out. Today, the ETH trades around the $4,000 mark, and many big bag holders are watching keenly as they anticipate the next move regarding Ethereum price projections. They are asking: Where is the next target for ETH? Would such moves affect other Ethereum-based tokens positively or even outperform ETH in the months to come? For instance, one token is attracting increasing attention: Remittix (RTX), an ERC-20 asset designed to address the issue of global money transfers. As Ethereum strengthens its base with spot ETF inflows, gas fee optimizations, and renewed DeFi/NFT activity, some traders believe RTX could emerge as the real breakout payment token in the Ethereum ecosystem. It’s a lot of information, but we will flesh it out together shortly. Several major tailwinds have fueled Ethereum’s climb above $4,000: What’s more, different Ethereum price projections are showing that ETH could hit a new ATH if it manages to break through the old ATH and move towards $5,500–$6,000 by Q1 2026, especially should the macro fundamentals agree. However, while ETH remains a huge part of crypto whales’ portfolios, they are also exploring and positioning themselves in other Ethereum-based tokens that could feel the impact of the big ETH bullish move that’s to come. One notable one is Remittix. Remittix (RTX) is an Ethereum-based token explicitly developed for one use case: cross-border money transfers. The platform bridges crypto and fiat through a remittance model that avoids the costly intermediaries that dominate traditional remittance routes. Here’s why traders are calling it “the future of payments” within the Ethereum ecosystem: Ethereum’s current rally is likely just the beginning. The infrastructure upgrades, ETF exposure, and global DeFi revival position ETH as a long-term winner. But for those aiming to maximize upside potential, assets like Remittix represent a unique opportunity. As the Ethereum price climbs, keep an eye on the tokens it carries with it, and don’t be surprised if RTX becomes one of the most talked-about names before the next altcoin season is over.
