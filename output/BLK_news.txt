There was drama in the top of the table clash in Division 1A of the Energia All-Ireland League as Terenure College won the D6W derby against St Mary’s College 14-12 in a tense, tactical affair at Lakelands. Tries from John McKee and Oisín McCormack, both converted by Chris Cosgrave, gave Nure just enough breathing room to survive four Mick O’Gara penalties. Defending champions Clontarf picked up a 17-3 win away to Cork Constitution at Temple Hill in a repeat of last season’s decider. Fionn Gilbert’s brace, one in each half, proved the catalyst, Conor Kelly added two conversions and a penalty. Con’s sole reply came from an Aidan Moynihan penalty deep in the first half. UCD climbed out of the drop zone with a 34-12 bonus-point win over Young Munster in Belfield. A quickfire Evan Moynihan double before half-time set the tone, and second-half tries from Michael O’Reilly, Dan Barron, and Daniel Hurley pushed the Students comfortably clear. Lansdowne surged to a 36-11 victory at Old Belvedere. Andy Marks and Bobby Sheehan both crossed twice, with George Morris adding a fifth try deep into stoppage time. Charlie Tector contributed five conversions and a penalty from the tee. Belvo stayed in sight during the first half through Daragh O’Dwyer’s penalties and an Andre Ryan try, but couldn’t contain Lansdowne in the second half. Ballynahinch impressed again in a 24-3 win away to Nenagh Ormond, scoring twice in each half with Tom McAllister, Aaron Sexton, Bradley Luney and Sam Warwick all crossing for tries In Division 1B, Garryowen produced a strong second-half push to win 29-15 away to City of Armagh, with Fionn Rowsome grabbing a clinical hat-trick. Instonians turned things around late on to defeat Highfield 17-15, while Naas overturned a half-time deficit to beat Blackrock College 32-20. Leaders Old Wesley overcame rivals Trinity 30-16, while UCC got their first win of the season, defeating Queen’s 27-12. There were narrow wins for Banbridge, MU Barnhall, and Corinthians in Division 2A, Ballymena staged a remarkable comeback from 17-0 down at the half to beat Cashel 29–23, while Shannon ground out a valuable 10–7 victory at Greystones. In 2B, Galwegians delivered an empathetic 43-21 win against UL Bohemian in their top of the table clash, Clogher Valley struck twice late on to beat Enniscorthy, while Skerries also struck late against Buccaneers to win 25-23. Malone claimed a strong 35-19 win at Sligo, while Rainey picked up a valuable 19-10 away win against Navan In 2C, Monkstown once again came out on top against Ballyclare, winning 43-34 in a high-scoring affair, Belfast Harlequins held off Midleton, Clonmel ended Thomond’s unbeaten start, Malahide recorded their first win of the season, while Bective Rangers picked up a win away to Dolphin, 20 years after their last meeting ended in defeat. In the Energia All-Ireland Junior Cup quarter-finals, Athy, Creggs and Dromore all booked their place in the semi-final, while Seapoint and Wicklow will meet in two weeks to determine who joins them, as their game was postponed due to the rainfall. In the Women’s Division, holders UL Bohemian held off a spirited Galwegians side 36-24 to move top and remain unbeaten, with Chloe Pearse crossing for a hat-trick. Blackrock continued their winning form with a 60-5 win over Tullow. Robyn O’Connor crossed for four tries as Old Belvedere defeated Ballincollig 65-7 in another statement win, while Railway Union were sharp in a 48-7 success over Wicklow, Heidi Lyons and Claire Boles crossing for braces. Ennis returned to winning ways defeating Cooke 22-19 thanks to a sensational four-try performance from Aoibhín Donnelly.

Title: More than half of low and middle-income Americans now own stocks. Here's why.

The stock market isn’t just for rich people anymore. More than half of low- and middle-income Americans now invest in capital markets, according to new research by the BlackRock Foundation and Commonwealth, a financial nonprofit. And a majority of those less-affluent investors, with household incomes ranging from $30,000 to $80,000, started investing in the past 5 years. In prior generations, owning stocks often meant you had a broker and a lot of money. Even today, the top 1% of wealthy Americans owns half of all stock, federal data shows. But technological leaps and industry shifts have dramatically lowered the bar for entering the market. Nowadays, just about anyone can buy in. “The entry barriers are lower,” said Timothy Flacke, CEO of Commonwealth. “You can start with 50 dollars or, in many cases, a dollar, and a smartphone. That matters.” Stock tips used to circulate in highbrow finance magazines and subscription newsletters as well as country-club golf courses. Today, anyone with internet access can summon an avalanche of investment advice with a simple Google search. YouTube and TikTok brim with investment influencers. And buying stock has never been easier. Online platforms allow consumers to purchase shares without the aid of brokers or the burden of fees. For the price of a coffee, you can own a piece of the market. “These days, no brokerages charge commissions, and many of them allow for fractional shares,” said Robert Brokamp, a senior retirement adviser and financial planning expert at The Motley Fool. “You can invest as little as 5 dollars, in some cases, and get a portion of a share of Nvidia or Microsoft.” The report from BlackRock Foundation and Commonwealth, published Oct. 13, draws from a nationally representative survey of more than 2,750 Americans, all from households with low or moderate incomes. It’s part of a larger initiative to study the flood of new investors into the stock market during the COVID-19 pandemic years. In 2020 and 2021 alone, individual investors opened 46 million new brokerage accounts. The pandemic inspired many Americans to try their hand at investing: They were stuck in their homes, spending less and amassing savings, partly thanks to the federal stimulus effort. “There were some folks who found themselves either with more cash or with more time,” Flacke said. For middle-class Americans, stocks and real estate have served as gateways to the American Dream, rewarding a modest investment with a lifetime of capital gains. In recent years, however, spiraling home prices and rising interest rates have pushed homeownership out of reach for many. The stock market, with no minimum investment, remains a viable alternative for building wealth. “A lot of younger people and a lot of lower-income people have not been able to buy their way into the housing market,” said Caleb Silver, editor-in-chief of the financial journalism site Investopedia. “But they have been able to build their net worth by investing in the stock market, and by owning individual stocks.” As a tool for building wealth, the stock market has done an admirable job of advertising itself. The S&P 500 rose by 261% over the past decade, climbing at an annual rate of 13.6%, according to The Motley Fool. “With a few exceptions, the market has been on an extraordinary tear over the last 10-15 years,” Brokamp said. “That just attracts more attention, and more people invest.” In time, rising stock ownership among lower-income Americans could chip away at historic wealth disparities. In the first quarter of 2025, the bottom 50% of Americans by net worth owned just 1% of all stocks, according to a Motley Fool analysis. With many more lower- and middle-income consumers owning stocks, perhaps their portfolios will eventually grow. “Americans are very good at being consumers,” Silver said. “But they’re also becoming better at being owners, owners of the companies that they’re spending money on.” Lower-income investors have much the same aspirations as higher-income Americans, according to the BlackRock report. Survey respondents cited these as their top investment goals: The survey does not include 401(k) accounts, IRAs and other tax-favored investments. It focuses on consumers investing through standard brokerage accounts. The survey found that newer investors are more likely to own individual stocks, rather than mutual funds or ETFs. That could be a problem. All stocks are volatile, and individual stocks are generally more mercurial than mutual funds and ETFs, which often mirror the performance of a stock or bond index. “My personal preference is for people to start with index funds and then move into individual stocks,” Brokamp said. “But it looks like the opposite is happening now.” The survey suggests new investors “are really hungry for information about how to diversify” their investments, said Claire Chamberlain, President of The BlackRock Foundation. “One of the things the industry can do is meet people where they are.” The financial services industry could help new investors, for example, by encouraging more households to open emergency savings accounts, Chamberlain said. A recent analysis by Investopedia found that the average American family should have at least $35,000 in emergency savings to cover unexpected expenses. Emergency savings deliver financial security. Without savings, a lower-income family is more apt to cash out an investment account if a car breaks down or the roof leaks. “One of the things that this survey revealed is the importance of having emergency savings,” Chamberlain said, “to support the investor’s ability to stay the course.”

Title: BlackRock Launches Expansion Of $2.5 Billion BUIDL Fund Into Binance And BNB Chain

Securitize and Binance have jointly announced on Friday that the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) will now be accepted as off-exchange collateral for trading on Binance. Fortune reported that the collaboration with Binance is expected to boost the popularity of BUIDL, a token launched by the world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock, last year. Since its inception, BUIDL has witnessed significant growth, with its market capitalization exceeding $2.5 billion. Functioning akin to a stablecoin, BUIDL is commonly utilized as collateral for trading cryptocurrency derivatives, catering primarily to large institutional investors like private equity firms and hedge funds that make a minimum investment of $5 million into the BlackRock BUIDL fund. What sets BUIDL apart from traditional stablecoins like Tether (USDT) and Circle (USDC) is its unique feature of distributing the yield collected from its reserves to investors. Currently offering a yield of around 4%, BlackRock imposes a management fee ranging from 0.2% to 0.5% on the token. To bring BUIDL into existence, BlackRock collaborates with Securitize, a company specializing in issuing digital assets. Securitize’s CEO, Carlos Domingo, highlighted the growing popularity of tokenized assets due to their ability to facilitate quick and efficient trade settlements. Domingo emphasized the “antiquated nature” of current capital market ledgers, often built on outdated software, contrasting this with the “agile and near-instant settlement capabilities” of blockchain technology. Catherine Chen, Binance’s Head of VIP & Institutional, noted that the addition of BUIDL was driven partly by customer demand. She noted in the statement: Integrating BUIDL with our banking triparty partners and our crypto-native custody partner, Ceffu, meets their needs and enables our clients to confidently scale allocation while meeting compliance requirements. Concurrently, BUIDL is set to introduce a new share class on the BNB Chain network, enhancing investor reach and interoperability with other blockchain financial applications. Launched in March 2024, BUIDL marked BlackRock’s inaugural tokenized fund on a public blockchain, tokenized by Securitize, offering qualified investors access to U.S. dollar yields with flexible custody, daily dividend payouts, and seamless peer-to-peer transfers. This integration builds upon BUIDL’s presence across networks like Arbitrum (ARB), Aptos (APT), Avalanche (AVAX), Ethereum (ETH), Optimism (OP), Polygon (POL), and Solana (SOL), further enhancing its accessibility and utility within the blockchain ecosystem. When writing, Binance’s native token, BNB, trades at $931.60, recording losses exceeding 20% in the past 30 days. This positions Binance Coin 32% below all-time high levels of $1,369 reached back in October of this year.

Title: After Lions tour and last Autumn Nations, Wallabies ‘now well versed with Ireland players’
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/rugby/2025/11/15/after-lions-tour-and-last-autumn-nations-wallabies-now-well-versed-with-ireland-players/

It’s 7.50am on Friday. The high-pitched whine is an audible reminder of the wind that buffets the doors of the Radisson hotel in Stillorgan, Co Dublin; the slanting rain being the second element in a two-pronged assault. A seagull seeks shelter under an awning. Joe Schmidt bids farewell to a friend in the lobby, stopping briefly for a chat. Australia will soon make the short hop to Blackrock for their Captain’s Run. Upstairs, Wallabies skipper Harry Wilson holds court, an engaging interviewee. There are no Australian journalists present, instead a couple take to the online portal. It’ll be a slow day in every respect, once the on-pitch run-though is over. Coffee and Netflix get a mention, the staples for a team confined to base. Both Wilson and Schmidt mentioned last year’s clash between the countries, a game the Wallabies led until the final eight minutes, when Ireland pilfered a 22-19 win. Andy Farrell’s side have eight survivors in the run-on team, Australia, nine, so there are enough points of difference not to get bogged down by historical reference. Wilson pointed out that between last November’s meeting and the Lions series the Wallabies have become well versed with the Ireland players. Wilson was asked about one of them, Jack Conan. “He’s a really good ball carrier, a strong ball carrier, which you definitely felt during that Lions series. He’s quite good in the lineout too, got a good jump on him, so I think he’ll definitely help their lineout,” he said. “When you have a player like Caelan Doris move to seven, they’re going to have a lot of good ball carriers in their backrow. That’s a really big point for us where our backrow is going to have to step up and try and stop them there because they’ve obviously picked quite a big one. But I think it’s always exciting when you get to go up against three quality backrows.” Three kilometres down the road at the Aviva Stadium it was a case of “right back at you” as Caelan Doris, the Ireland captain, was asked about the Aussie loose trio and in particular the indefatigable Fraser McReight. “Set piece is a big focus area,” Doris said. “Scrum and lineout, how we show up there. Breakdown-wise, I’m obviously playing seven [and] up against McReight, who’s been world-class over the last couple of years. I think he was top poacher in the Rugby Championship and contests a ton of balls. So, breakdown is going to be a big point. “He’s [McReight] extremely fit. His work-rate is almost unparalleled. We saw a clip of him, I think it was the 76th minute of a game a few weeks back. He makes a tackle, gets off the ground, chases, gets on the end of a ball and scores a try. His stats each game are very high. “He has got a good skill set as well, he’s a good footballer and has the ability to play the ball off the line. He’s not the biggest guy, but he carries pretty strongly as well. The standout thing is his work rate.” Doris is unfazed by swapping his traditional role at eight for a crack at openside flanker. He will continue to try to cause chaos at the breakdown. “The first breakdown battle off scrums and lineouts is going to be a difference. Up against McReight, it’s going to be one that I’m looking forward to and need to get right,” he said. There is a sense that both Ireland and Australia are trying to wriggle out from underneath a blanket of criticism in some quarters that decries a level of recent underperformance. The Wallabies are suffering legacy disappointment from Udine and the 26-19 defeat to Italy; Ireland from the 13-26 defeat to the All Blacks in Chicago and a failure to blossom in the opening 40-minutes against Japan. Australia are looking for energy to sustain them through the penultimate game of a long season and better discipline in a broad sense; Ireland for improved accuracy at the set piece and in handling. It’s what is missing rather than what’s there that’s generated the greater angst outside of the respective camps. The final word to Doris. “The World Cup rankings are done in December, so from that point of view it’s massively important but also in terms of continuing the belief and improvement. [To get the result] it’s got to be process-focused, performance-focused, so that is what we are putting our minds towards. It’s the consistency defensively and in what we’re doing in attack that needs to improve this weekend.” Join The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to date What’s making headlines in the rugby world?

Title: AIL preview: Big Leinster names to feature in Dublin 6W derby face off

Like never before, the Dublin 6W derby has more than just local bragging rights at stake, as second-placed Terenure College host St Mary’s College at Lakelands Park (kick off 3pm) in an Energia All-Ireland League Division 1A summit meeting. St Mary’s arrive with five wins out of five, and 23 points out of a possible 25, while Terenure have won four of their five games to lie second on 21 points. Supporters of both came from far and wide last season when the clubs traded home wins in front of huge crowds for their first AIL derbies in seven years after St Mary’s returned to the top flight. Although some big Leinster names are among those featuring in this full programme of matches – weather permitting – the pity is that Terenure’s brilliant young halfbacks, Fintan Gunne and Caspar Gabriel, were not released. They were central figures to a third successive bonus point when beating high-flying Ballynahinch 52-12 away a fortnight ago. But they have a plethora of skilful, versatile backs and Carlos Spencer moves former Leinster back Chris Cosgrave, who scored a hat-trick in Ballynahinch, to outhalf. Caolan Cooley comes in at left wing, Kiwi scrumhalf Griffin Culver returns, while Leinster have released hooker John McKee, with Oisín McCormack, Max Russell and returning captain Luke Clohessy forming a new backrow. St Mary’s have been boosted by the fitness of their captain/playmaker Conor Dean, injured in their 27-26 win over Con last time, while Mark McHugh brings in winger Aaron O’Sullivan, scrumhalf Colm Reilly and tighthead Mick McCormack as former Munster centre Dan Goggin continues at number eight. Reigning champions Clontarf sit third and travel to Cork Con in a repeat of last season’s final, with the home side in serious need of a win after three successive defeats. ‘Tarf welcome back Dylan O’Grady, Hugh Cooney and Alan Spicer. [ Joe Schmidt back on familiar ground as Wallabies face Ireland in DublinOpens in new window ] Lansdowne, in fourth, renew their age-old rivalry with Old Belvedere in Ollie Campbell Park, with Declan Fassbender’s one change from the side which beat Nenagh 62-17 being a notable one with Leinster’s Max Deegan in at number eight. Belvo make four changes, including Daragh O’Dywer at outhalf. UCD welcome Young Munster, with Andrew Osborne at fullback, while the Cookies welcomes Munster trio Shay McCarthy and halfbacks Tony Butler and Jake O’Riordan. Promoted Nenagh Ormond, still winless, host Ballynahinch after contrasting Bateman Cup outings, the latter’s ruthless 78-0 win over Sligo regaining them momentum. Among the home side’s five changes, Charlie O’Doherty start at 10 and captain Kevin O’Flaherty returns at lock. Remarkably, there are also summit meeting in 1B, where leaders Old Wesley host a resurgent Trinity; in 2A when unbeaten Barnhall travel to Dungannon; in 2B where UL Bohs host Galwegians as the only two unbeaten sides and completing a double header in UL at 5pm, there is an identical match-up in the women’s division between UL Bohs, seeking a third successive title, and surprise leaders Galwegians. Division 1A: Cork Constitution v Clontarf, Temple Hill; Nenagh Ormond v Ballynahinch, New Ormond Park; Old Belvedere v Lansdowne, Ollie Campbell Park; UCD v Young Munster, Belfield; Terenure College v St. Mary’s College, Lakelands Park, 3pm (IrishRugby+). Division 1B: City of Armagh v Garryowen, Palace Grounds; Instonians v Highfield, Shaw’s Bridge; Naas v Blackrock College, Forenaughts; Old Wesley v Dublin University, Energia Park; UCC v Queen’s, The Mardyke, 3pm.

Title: Domhnall Nugent: ‘This guy messaged to say that after I talked about addiction, he went to the GP and it saved his life’

The last time St John’s were in an Antrim county final, Domhnall Nugent went a bit viral. It was 2017 and it was the football final and the first thing to understand about it is that he wasn’t playing for St John’s. Rather, he was in the colours of Belfast rivals Lámh Dearg and neither club had won an Antrim title in the guts of a quarter-century. The second thing to understand is that Nugent was playing against not just some of his best friends and neighbours but also his family. His father Paddy was managing St John’s, his brother Pádraig was in goals. Finally, you must understand that he was 20 years old and he was an alcoholic, with all the chaos and bad decisions that entails. With 10 minutes to go and Lámh Dearg two points up, his brother Pádraig went to take a kick out for St John’s, only for Domhnall to run in and kick the ball away to waste time. It had the desired effect – Pádraig drew out and hit him, earning himself a red card. Domhnall got away with yellow for his messing and Lámh Dearg went on to see out the last 10 minutes against 14 men. He had his 15 minutes of social media infamy in the days that followed. In the eight years since, Domhnall Nugent has been to hell and back. He is six-and-a-half years sober, he has made it back to the Antrim hurling panel and won a Joe McDonagh medal, he is in a solid relationship with his girlfriend Amy and life is good. But it wasn’t until the St John’s hurlers played in the county final last month that he was able to box off that niggling page of the ledger. “I’m not gonna lie,” he says. “Lámh Deargh in 2017 against St John’s was in the middle of my madness. And honestly, there wasn’t one night I went to bed and didn’t think about that from then until the night before the county final a few weeks ago. “Honestly, I had forgiven myself for nearly everything. But not that. And I enjoyed my time with Lámh Dearg and it was good crack and there’s no bad blood or anything. It was just the way it sat for me. “My password on my old Bebo account used to be the 17.03.20 – basically, the 17th of March sometime in the 2020s. It was a way of saying I wanted to someday be in Croke Park on St Patrick’s Day in the club finals. That was always my thing. “So the relief that I got even off getting to a county final with St John’s was unbelievable. And then winning it, that was the first thing that came into my head. I get to celebrate this with everyone that I grew up with.” Nugent is 28 years old now and he is well and in a good place. Davy Fitzgerald is giving him a shot at being one of the goalkeepers on the Antrim panel over the winter, which may or may not work out but he’s up for taking it as far as he can anyway. He is also the current Down camogie manager, exercising a coaching muscle that he has been working on ever since he took a St John’s under-12 team when he was just 15. [ Davy Fitzgerald ‘more guarded’ after criticism over Antrim commentsOpens in new window ] But though he is in the planning stage with all that stuff, the here and now is about the St John’s senior hurlers. In beating Loughgiel a few weeks back, the Belfast club won their first hurling county title in 52 years. They’re more famous as a football club and sit on top of the Antrim roll of honour in the big ball code. But this is only their eighth hurling crown, five of which were won in a 12-year period in the 1960s and 70s. So when it happened, when half a century of nothing finally became something, Nugent threw off his helmet and tried to take it all in. He has a picture in his phone of the first person to reach him to celebrate – his brother Pádraig, fists clenched, mouth roared open. The circle squared. “It was just class,” Domhnall says. “But on the other side of it, a club championship like that is probably number one in most people’s things in life they want to do. But mine has to be my recovery. That’s where Amy came into it. We actually sat down before the final and we booked a flight for the Monday morning to go to Spain for 10 days. “We just got out the gap straight after the county final and that was it. Which was good. It’s good to have that support system where you’re going, ‘Right, you understand me – let’s get out of here.’ I went to St John’s for an hour after the match and then we went home and got a pizza and watched a movie. That was me, content and happy out.” Nugent has spent plenty of time talking in public about his struggles over the years. He did his first big interview with The Irish News back in 2019, a couple of months after coming out of Cuan Mhuire in Newry. He has done the rounds of national media days promoting Movember and the GPA’s mental health initiatives. And it has helped people. He knows it has. [ From the archive: Domhnall Nugent to take time from hurling to help run mental health campaignOpens in new window ] “Recently I got an email from a guy who was at the gig I did in Croke Park two years ago. I went to do the launch of the Ahead of the Game for Movember. This guy messaged me to say that the day after I talked about addiction at it, he went to the GP and it saved his life. So you just never know the impact that you can make on people’s lives. That’s what it was about.” Through it all, he hasn’t sugar-coated anything. He has talked about being homeless, about being addicted to drink and drugs, about lying to the people closest to him. Stories of blowing thousands of pounds, of being left with nothing, of scrabbling around McDonald’s late at night looking to swipe leftover chicken nuggets. He has been brave and open and unflinching. Sometimes to a fault. “I was probably naive for myself. It was the right thing to do for other people, but I’m probably not so sure it was always the right thing to do for me. One, for my recovery and two, for my hurling. “I probably got put on a pedestal and probably pigeonholed myself as someone who was in recovery, someone who was in addiction. And kind of forgot about, ‘Oh, I actually need to work on being fitter or stronger and my touch needs to be better and I need to get better finishing.’ And all these things that I probably didn’t really think about much. “The other part of it, the validation part, that’s probably something that I kind of grabbed on to. People saying to me, ‘Oh, you’re great for speaking out and you’re this and you’re that.’ In some ways, that’s the same thing I was getting from drinking. “It’s two different things but it’s the same feeling. You’re being validated by a substance, whether that’s a human substance or a drink or a drug. So I probably grabbed on to that a wee bit too much. Then all of a sudden, you’re on social media and you’re a wee bit more active on Instagram and waiting on likes and comments because it’s like you’re chasing something. “But listen – do I regret it? No. I definitely would do it again because I know the impact that it’s all had. And there’s been a wee bit of growing up along the way too because I was so young when I got into rehab. I forget that. I forget that I’m six-and-a-half years sober and I’m 28.” Does it get easier? Not really. Or at least, that’s not really how he frames it. Sobriety isn’t a done deal. The lease runs out every night and you start again on a new agreement the next day. It isn’t about easier or harder. It’s just what he has to do. “I want to be very honest with you,” he says. “I think about drink a lot. There wouldn’t be a week in the past six and a half years where I wouldn’t have thought about having a drink. Or going, ‘Jesus, I’d love a pint.’ Or even a wee whiskey. I do think about it regularly. “Sometimes I dream about it and wake up the next morning, tasting Jameson down the back of my throat. You’d wake up sweating and afraid that you’ve relapsed and stuff like that. “So it’s definitely something that is still in me. And I’m just really, really good at the minute. I’m so happy I can say that now because I probably wouldn’t have before. Like, I’m so good and proud that I’m managing it really well through AA and through my friend group, the people who I surround myself with. “I’m so lucky. I’m in a good relationship and I have Amy and things are really, really good. She understands me and I understand her. But it took me a long time to be able to let someone into that journey with me. Even whenever I was sober, I was half-letting people in and getting afraid and pushing them off and doing mad things, stupid things. Just because I wasn’t comfortable. “I always just talk about this journey of no destination. That’s where I’m at. This journey doesn’t have a destination. Obviously it’s great, this kind of fairytale of winning a club championship. That’s brilliant. But that can’t be the journey. External things can’t be the journey. It has to start with you and end with you.” So on he goes and on they go. St John’s have only ever played one Ulster club hurling match – when they won Antrim in 1973, they went out the next day and trounced Ballygalget of Down before getting a walkover in the final against Dungiven. The following March they went all the way down to Cork where Blackrock beat them by 19 points in the All-Ireland semi-final. They start this weekend against Donegal club Setanta and after that, they can only go the only way he knows. One day at a time. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Tadhg Beirne: ‘There’s so much more in us - we’re a far cry away from our potential at the moment’

Time Published: 2025-11-15T06:00:00Z

Tadhg Beirne tells a story about Johann van Graan replacing him around the hour mark back in his second season with Munster. Beirne had arrived in Munster in 2016, and Van Graan a year later. They were still getting to know each other and the Monday after replacing him, the coach was about to learn more about Beirne. “I went into his office,” recalls Beirne, “and I was like: ‘Why did you take me off?’ And he was like: ‘I just felt you looked like you needed to come off.’ And I was like: ‘Yeah? I feel like I’m an 80-minute player’.” From that day on, Beirne became one of Van Graan’s 80-minute men. Last season, Beirne completed 80 minutes in all bar one of his 16 starts for Munster, when coming off for the last three minutes away to Ulster. Ditto in his nine starts as an ever-present for Ireland, save for a HIA against Scotland. On the Lions tour he played every minutes of the Tests, after which he was voted player of the series, and played more minutes than any other member of the squad. In all, Beirne played 2,544 minutes last season. In George Orwell’s Animal Farm, which Beirne read as part of his Leaving Cert back in the day, you suggest he would have to be the horse, aka Boxer. He laughs. Did he ever feel tired? “I think I did at times. But by the time the games come around, you’re okay.” You can understand why van Graan felt compelled to replace him. At times on the pitch – maybe it’s the headgear or the gait – he looks shattered. [ Tadhg Beirne happy to crown ‘season full of ups and downs’ with men’s player of the year nodOpens in new window ] “I feel like, often, towards the end of the game is when I can probably express myself a bit more. I suppose you’re probably watching people around you start to diminish a bit. I never feel so tired that I need to come off. I’m just ‘next play’. I don’t know what it is.” He reveals one extreme example. “I don’t think I’ve ever felt as bad physically as I did after the first Lions Test, and through that whole week. When I got to the Friday, during the captain’s run I was like: ‘Actually this is the worst I’ve felt going into a game’. But then, within the next 24 hours it just got better. The adrenaline kicked in, but that was definitely the worst I’d felt in a long time.” Playing every minute of a Lions’ Test series win made up for being restricted to a combined 16 minutes in two appearances off the bench in a losing series behind closed doors four years earlier. In Australia there was the added bonus of his wife Harriet being there, and were his three sisters, Jennifer, Alannah and Caoimhe (who all lived there at the time) and his parents, Brenda and Gerry. “My older sister’s fiancé was there, younger sister’s boyfriend was there as well, and then I had my aunt and godmother [Fiona] and uncle [Tomás] and their daughter Orla was out as well.” And so too were his cousins Leigh, who lives in Perth, and Cillian. “We are really close, and I’m the only boy, and it’s great for my parents who are retired.” In truth he hasn’t had a day with Ireland or Munster quite like that, but he’s not done yet. The end of a playing career is often related to its beginning. One ventures Johnny Sexton played on until he was 38 in part because he didn’t make his breakthrough with Leinster until he was 23 and with Ireland when he was 24. Similarly, Beirne had played plenty of rugby with the Irish Under-20s and in the AIL, but he was 23 when his career took off with the Scarlets, and 26 when he made his Ireland debut. Last Saturday, Beirne was one of five Ireland players from Kildare in the matchday 23, and in that sense is something of a trailblazer. It’s always been more of a GAA county. “Gaelic and soccer were my two main sports as a kid. Then I tried rugby when I was in fifth class and hated it, so I quit after a month.” All changed when he went to Clongowes. “Rugby was compulsory, so you end up playing, and then you see the senior cup team and all of a sudden you’re in awe.” He had so many sliding doors moments. On leaving school he went into the Leinster system. They’d just created a Bs team which led to two years in the sub-academy with Dave Fagan before three seasons in the full academy. Injuries blighted his three years in the academy, and his lack of bulk. “It was a different game as well. It was very size-orientated and that’s not something I had at the time. I came out of Clongowes at 78kg. If you see pictures of me back then, I’m skin and bone. This morning, I was 120kg!” During his time in the academy, as well as delivering pizza, coaching Blackrock and studying, Beirne played for Lansdowne Under-20s and senior team, with whom he won two AIL medals in 2012-13 and 2014-15, beating Clontarf in both finals, although he was benched for the second one. We just fell short at times, unfortunately. But I’ve enjoyed all my time at Munster “I was on the bench. I didn’t turn up for training the week before the final and Mike Ruddock dropped me.” Was Ruddock right? “Probably, yeah. I was a bit young and dumb. I think I went to the Trinity Ball the night before.” The following season, Leinster opted to sign Ian Nagle and keep Hayden Triggs, thereby releasing Beirne. “I remember walking off the field in UCD on my own knowing it was my last session. It was emotional, just knowing it was done.” As he was doing his master’s, he told his agent that he had to stay in the Pro12 or England. The Scarlets came in for him, he flew to Wales, met Wayne Pivac and accepted the only rugby offer on the table. “They signed me for very little money,” he says, laughing. After two great years there, winning a Pro12 and Pro12 player of the season, Beirne was within one more season of becoming Welsh qualified when Munster stepped in. Having made his international debut at the age of 26 in Australia, he was part of that series win and also the series win in New Zealand in 2023, and the Grand Slam earlier that year when sidelined with an ankle injury for the last three games. “Obviously it was class to be out there,” he says of the St Patrick’s Day coronation after beating England in the Aviva. “But I’m hobbling around. I’m in a [moon]boot.” There was also the Six Nations title in 2024, a host of landmark wins and individual awards, as well as Munster’s 2022-23 URC title and becoming Munster’s captain. Yet, he sounds more driven than ever. Beirne has unfinished business and though he could yet play until he’s 40, not a huge amount of time to do so. Everything [Clayton McMillan] has been doing is brilliant for the squad, giving lads opportunities “Ideally, we could have won a lot more. There’s been ups and downs, and that’s well documented in Munster. The quality of the squads we’ve had, we probably should have achieved a bit more. We just fell short at times, unfortunately. But I’ve enjoyed all my time at Munster. “I thought Johann was incredible when he was in there. At times he got a hard rap for what he did, but in terms of the circumstances and what he was producing, it was very impressive.” Like seemingly all at Munster, Beirne is hugely enthused by the arrival of Clayton McMillan this season. “Last year was a difficult year and I think the freshness that he’s brought in and the way he’s doing things, the way he sees the game, simplifying it in many ways for a lot of players, takes a lot of pressure off them. Everything he’s doing has been brilliant for the squad, giving lads opportunities. It all adds to a happier, healthier squad.” On Saturday evening Beirne comes up against another significantly influential coach in his career in Joe Schmidt, who gave him his debut in 2018. “I feared Joe. I think most people did. Did he make me a better player? Yeah, 100 per cent, because of the detail part. That’s what everyone speaks about, and it’s the same with Faz [Andy Farrell].” Farrell took the team on to another level with that 17-game winning run and the number one ranking. This team have many of the same personnel without quite scaling those heights since, but Beirne maintains: “We’re in a really good place. I think we’re evolving in the right way, in the way we attack and defend. “I think there’s so much more in us and we’re a far cry away from our potential at the moment. I still think we’re one of the best teams in the world for sure. I think we just need to chase it, to go out and prove it.” [ Andy Farrell hits the refresh button hoping to breath new life into IrelandOpens in new window ] And, eh, the lineout malfunctions? “I was calling the lineouts [against Japan], and it was just individual errors all around. The first one was an overthrow. It’s tough, that happens. “And then we proceeded to have two calls when lads misheard the call. It makes the lineout look like a shambles, but they’re the easiest things to fix up. So all of a sudden, I’m trying to be clearer with my voice, so that they don’t mishear me again.” That also happened for the one lineout he called in Soldier Field against the All Blacks before, of course, his third-minute yellow card when Beauden Barrett ran into him was wrongly upgraded into a 20-minute red card, which has been since rescinded. [ Ireland’s unconvincing Japan jobOpens in new window ] “When it happened, I was like: ‘Oh, I felt him on my shoulder there’. I remember saying to the lads in the huddle: ‘I think it’s a penalty. I may end up going off for a yellow card, I don’t know’.” Initially an official told Beirne it would only be a yellow before subsequently confirming that, like all yellow cards, it would go to a bunker review. “It wasn’t until he came up to me probably 30 seconds before I started warming up and he was like: ‘You have a red card.’ I was like: ‘What do you mean?’ It was a bit of a shock.” James Lowe has described the Rugby World Cup in 2027 as his North Star. Is that Beirne’s, or has his eye on a third Lions tour in 2029? “The Lions could be a push but the way I’m feeling I don’t see it [the World Cup] as my North Star now. I see it as the next thing to strive for. I don’t see it as an ending, if you get me. I just see it as the next big competition, especially after the last World Cup, to hopefully right the wrongs of that World Cup.” “It still haunts me,” he admits of that epic 28-24 quarter-final loss to New Zealand, when a 37-phase Irish attack culminated in Wayne Barnes awarding Sam Whitelock a jackal penalty, even though he clearly didn’t release after tackling Rónan Kelleher. “It wasn’t a penalty. Well,” Beirne corrects himself with a smile. “It was a penalty for us.” It would be nice to go back to Australia and create more special memories in front of family and friends in two years’ time? “That’s the goal.” © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Celebrated illustrated history of the 15th century to be sold at Offaly auction

Antiquarian book dealers and academic libraries across Europe and the United States have already been in contact with Conor Purcell in advance of his auction of books – almost all of which belonged to one collector – on Wednesday, November 26th. As is so often the case, the sellers of The Library of An Irish Gentleman won’t reveal themselves. But, I expect some savvy collectors and local aficionados might know the provenance of these ancient books, such as the first edition of the Nuremberg Chronicle, printed in July 1493 (€20,000-€30,000). Conor Purcell of Purcell auctioneers in Birr, Co Offaly, says that it will be the first time that a copy of what is deemed to be the most extensively illustrated 15th century book, has ever been offered for sale at auction in Ireland. A pictorial history of the world, the Nuremberg Chronicle (known in German as Schedelsche Weltchronik or Schedel’s World History) was originally written in Latin by medical doctor and book collector, Hartmann Schedel. It includes woodcut illustrations of biblical scenes, early maps of Europe and the world and some of the first created topographical views of towns and cities in Europe and the Middle East. Nuremberg was one of the largest cities in central and western Europe in the 1490s. Around 400 copies of the original Latin version of the book are believed to be still in existence.Purcell says the 1587 edition of Holinshed’s Chronicles (€10,000-€20,000) – another highly collectable book in the auction – is a “cornerstone of English Renaissance historiography”. Compiled by Raphael Holinshed, these historical accounts of England, Scotland and Ireland would have been a primary source of material for writers such as William Shakespeare, Christopher Marlowe and Edmund Spenser. Another highlight is a 1512 edition of a book of hours written in Latin and French (€5,000-€10,000). Books of hours were early Christian prayer books used by those who prayed at specific times of the day (known as canonical hours) in the monastic tradition. This book of hours includes fifteen prayers of St Brigid. During the Covid pandemic, Purcell Auctioneers began selling more and more books as they were easier to sell online and dispatch around the world. This dedication to book selling has paid off, as they have since sold the libraries of many public figures including the late politicians, Conor Cruise O’Brien and Garret FitzGerald, the late journalist, Bruce Arnold and the late owner of Grogan’s pub on Dublin’s South William St, Tommy Smith. “We take all the books from sellers, as intact book collections will absolutely create higher value as they gives a true reflection of the collecting nuances of each collector,” says Purcell. The two volumes of Christian Art in Ancient Ireland (Saorstat Eireann, 1932) compiled by the German archaeologist, Adolf Mahr (€80-€160) is another fascinating book in the Purcell auction. Mahr was a director of the National Museum of Ireland in the 1930s, but was later dismissed when he became leader of the Dublin Nazi chapter. Other books of interest include The Odyssey of Homer and the Iliad of Homer, translated by Alexander Pope and printed in 1715 (€1,000-€1,500), several editions of Paradise Lost by John Milton, and The Plays of William Shakespeare in ten volumes (€200-€400). De Búrca Rare Books, based in Blackrock, Co Dublin, also have a vast collections of historic and contemporary books of Irish interest for potential Christmas gifts. Meanwhile, Gormleys auctions is hosting a sale of paintings and prints by Irish and international artists on Tuesday, November 25th at 7.30pm. Gerard Gormley says that the sale reflects the increasing demand for original prints by well established artists. “Collectors recognise the accessibility, rarity and artistic integrity of prints which often provide an entry point in the market,” he says. Highlights at Gormley’s auction – which is on view at 57 Francis St, Dublin from November 19th-25th (10am-5.30pm daily except Sunday, which is 12pm-4pm) include Banksy’s satirical screen print, Morons (€15,000-€20,000). “The piece has become emblematic of Banksy’s critique of consumerism and the commodification of art, while paradoxically commanding significant value in the very market it ridicules,” says Gormley. Patrick Scott’s Tangram 1, one of three pieces using gold leaf (€3,000-€5,000), is also for sale. Finally, Christmas present hunters will no doubt find some potential purchases at the R. J Keighery auction in Waterford city on Monday, November 17th. Among the 750 lots is an electrified three storey over basement Georgian style dolls house, fitted out with period pieces (€600-€1,000). Thomas Keighery says there has also been a lot of interest in a Waterford Crystal chess set in a mahogany case (€3,000-€5,000). Musicians might be keen to have a look at the zither, an antique folk instrument (€50-€80); the French oak-cased small organ (€60-€100); or the upright piano made by the former Liverpool-based instrument suppliers, Rushworth and Dreaper (€60-€100).

Title: Ireland Under-20s battle hard but are beaten by physical South Africa

South Africa were worthy winners, their physical edge in the set piece, scrum and lineout, a significant factor against a gutsy Ireland side that produced several passages of excellent rugby but ultimately were undone by a propensity to make mistakes. Both teams deserve credit for the rugby they produced in horrendous weather at Musgrave Park. The visitors, with the backing of a gale, started with purpose and power and while the home side survived that prolonged assault, a penalty from a ruck offence, offside, gave outhalf Vusi Moyo a long range, wind-assisted opportunity, which he landed with plenty to spare. Ireland lost Arthur Ashmore after 10 minutes, the Terenure man had made one superb carry before his departure with a shoulder injury, but his replacement Cahersiveen’s Michael O’Sullivan in his first action put in a superb tackle. Centres Sean Walsh and Johnny O’Sullivan, secondrow Dylan McNiece, number eight Diarmaid O’Connell and tighthead prop Sam Bishti excelled in the collisions and manufactured positive gain-lines, the only cavil was that scrumhalf Chris Barrett needed to be a little sharper at times to clear the ball. Right wing Charlie Molony, one of the returning players from last season, was a delight to watch, his ability to leave defenders with a handful of nothing roused the hardy home support, while fullback Noah Byrne was another who excelled. Ireland outhalf Tom Wood, in his second season at this level, kicked a 40-metre penalty, a staggering effort into the teeth of the elements to bring the sides level. South Africa though were quickly in the ascendancy once again when hooker Siphosethu Mnebelele barged over for a try, following a well-crafted maul. Moyo kicked a fine conversion to give South Africa a 10-3 lead. Wood, whose astute kicking game had caused problems for the visitors, had the chance to reduce the deficit after McNeice made another super carry but the Irish outhalf was unable to post the 22-metre penalty that ensued. Just before halftime South Africa were very fortunate not to be reduced to 14 players. Irish outhalf Wood was taken out in the air by right wing Khuthadzo Rasivhaga. It looked like a red card offence, no attempt to legitimately contest possession, running underneath the player and causing Wood to land on his back and head. That French referee Julien Caulier and his assistant no more than a couple of feet from the incident decided to award a knock-on beggared belief. After a prolonged period of treatment, the Irish outhalf gingerly walked from the pitch to be replaced by Conor O’Shaughnessy. Ireland got the perfect start to the second half, centre Walsh breaking a tackle en route to the try line. O’Shaughnessy converted to make it 10-10 two minutes after the restart. The home side were guilty of some sloppy play thereafter, basic mistakes and poor decisions and it cost them dearly; two tries, one converted, both from mauls, 12-points and a yellow card for Michael O’Sullivan. Ireland responded positively, a brilliant break from Byrne the precursor to a try for O’Connell. Phiwayinkosi Kubheka barged over for a try, after another Irish error, converted by Moyo as the visitors got a reward for their scrum and general forward dominance. Centre Johnny O’Sullivan hauled his side back into the game on 68-minutes, sharp in blocking down Pieter van der Merwe and collecting the loose ball to dot down for a try, one that O’Shaughnessy converted to make it 22-29. But yet another Irish mistake gave Moyo a chance to tag on another three points with a penalty, a healthy 32-22 lead for the visitors going into the last 10 minutes.

Title: Binance adds BlackRock’s BUIDL as off-exchange collateral for institutional traders

The integration marks another step in centralized exchanges adopting tokenized Treasurys, expanding RWA collateral across major trading platforms. Binance has begun accepting BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) as off-exchange collateral, giving institutions a way to trade on the exchange while keeping their assets with custodians. The integration combines BlackRock’s onchain money market fund with Binance’s custody systems, enabling traders to earn yield on BUIDL while using it to support trading positions on the exchange. A new BUIDL asset class will also launch on BNB Chain, expanding the token’s reach beyond Ethereum and opening it to a wider set of onchain applications, according to a blog post by Binance on Friday. With the addition of BUIDL, Binance supports multiple yield-bearing tokenized assets, including Circle’s USYC and OpenEden’s cUSDO. BUIDL is BlackRock’s first onchain liquidity fund — a tokenized, interest-bearing USD vehicle issued through Securitize. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, oversaw roughly $13.4 trillion in assets as of Q3 2025. Related: Securitize to go public in $1.25B BlackRock-backed merger As tokenized money-market funds shift from simple yield products to mainstream trading collateral, Binance joins a growing group of exchanges allowing qualified clients to post Treasury-backed tokens to back their positions. In July, Deribit and Crypto.com began accepting BUIDL as collateral, giving institutional traders a low-volatility, yield-bearing asset they can use in place of cash or stablecoins. In September, Bybit followed with support for QCDT, a Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA)-approved tokenized money-market fund backed by US Treasurys. The trend echoes traditional finance, where companies often pledge Treasurys and money-market funds as collateral through bank-run triparty systems rather than keeping assets on a trading venue. Tokenized US Treasurys have become the second-largest real-world assets (RWA) beyond stablecoins, with a current market cap of $8.57 billion, according to RWA.xyz data. The funds are led by BlackRock’s BUIDL, with about $2.52 billion in total value, Circle’s USYC with $1.06 billion and Franklin Templeton’s BENJI, with $850 million.

THE OLDEST EVER recruit to graduate from the Garda College has encouraged other people his age to “go for it”. Jeremiah Bourke, 51, said he wanted to join the gardaí when he was younger but missed the opportunity. He said he recognises it is going to be a “tough job”, but said: “You’re never too old. “If you’re able, why not? Give it a go. I’d say to anybody out there, if you want to go for it – go for it.” He added: “I’ve done it, anyone can do it.” Bourke said he had always had hope that he could become a garda, so re-applied when the recruiting age limit increased from 35 to 50 at the start of last year. He was within that age range when he applied. “I was in the retail business and wanted to give that a chance, but unfortunately as time goes fast the closing date for the competition passed me by.” He added: “I didn’t miss the bus time – and here I am attesting today at a later stage.” He said it was “not easy” and “a bit daunting” to go through the training alongside younger recruit, but said he was supported by his wife and two children as well as all those at the College. He was one of 194 gardaí attesting from the Templemore Garda College in Co Tipperary on Friday. Among them, Garda Amy Ni Riada was eager to get “stuck in” after trading in a career in the media to join An Garda Síochána. The former RTÉ journalist, from Castleisland in Co Kerry, said she developed a taste for working in high-pressure environments and a role with variety. Garda Amy Ni Riada, during graduation at Templemore Garda College, Co Tipperary. Alamy Stock Photo Alamy Stock Photo She was inspired to join the gardaí seeing the response to the November 2023 riots in Dublin. “It was an eye opener for me that I wanted to be stuck in and got involved in that way.” Advertisement Ni Riada, who will be stationed in Midleton, Co Cork, also said being in An Garda Síochána was perfect” for her desire to work with the most vulnerable people in society, having previously reported on climate change, social issues and violence against women in east Africa. They were among 194 new gardaí and 17 garda reserves attesting from the Garda College in Templemore on Friday. It is the largest single attestation of new gardaí since 2019 and the college will also see its largest class of recruits in a decade enter next week. Garda Kristina Courtney also left a career in communications and media production to join the gardaí. She said she was inspired to join after getting an insight into the operations of An Garda Síochána by working on RTÉ’s Crimecall programme. Garda Amy Ni Riada (left) and Kristina Courtney, during graduation at Templemore Garda College, Co Tipperary Alamy Stock Photo Alamy Stock Photo Part of her role involved making actors “look like the bad guys”. Asked how she felt about dealing with real bad guys, she replied: “I’m up for the challenge.” Dubliner Adam O’Rourke said he joined An Garda Síochána because he wanted a career where he could help people and challenge himself. Garda O’Rourke, from Walkinston, previously served with the Defence Forces in Lebanon. Now being stationed in Blackrock, Dublin, he said he was happy to start making a difference in the community: “It is a fantastic day, I couldn’t be happier.” Speaking at the Garda College, Taoiseach Micheál Martin said it was a “great honour” to “witness the continued growth of An Garda Síochána and to welcome its newest members”. Of the 194 attesting on Friday, 137 are men and 57 are women and the new probationers will be assigned to divisions across the country by the Garda Commissioner. Of the new gardai, 87 will be deployed across the Dublin Metropolitan Region, with 47 going to the Southern Region, 39 to the Eastern Region and 21 to North Western Region. Garda Commissioner Justin Kelly (centre) with graduating gardai (left to right) Jeremiah Burke, Amy Ni Riada, Kristina Courtney and Adam O'Rourke Alamy Stock Photo Alamy Stock Photo Commissioner Justin Kelly met some of those graduating and, speaking at the ceremony, said: “Today is a proud day. A day to celebrate with your family and loved ones. “A day to take stock of all it has taken to get you to this point. Today marks the start of your new career in An Garda Síochána.” To embed this post, copy the code below on your site 600px wide <iframe width="600" height="460" frameborder="0" style="border:0px;" src="https://www.thejournal.ie/https://www.thejournal.ie/templemore-garda-training-college-new-recruits-6875414-Nov2025/?embedpost=6875414&width=600&height=460" ></iframe> 400px wide <iframe width="600" height="460" frameborder="0" style="border:0px;" src="https://www.thejournal.ie/https://www.thejournal.ie/templemore-garda-training-college-new-recruits-6875414-Nov2025/?embedpost=6875414&width=400&height=460" ></iframe> 300px wide <iframe width="600" height="460" frameborder="0" style="border:0px;" src="https://www.thejournal.ie/https://www.thejournal.ie/templemore-garda-training-college-new-recruits-6875414-Nov2025/?embedpost=6875414&width=300&height=460" ></iframe> Access to the comments facility has been disabled for this user Create an email alert based on the current article

Title: The conference, K.M. and the ambassador, Tsipras, the “free dove” and its…consequences, the green eagle from Chios & why the Athens Stock Exchange now feels like August

Time Published: 2025-11-14T18:12:24Z
Full Content:
Hello, today we aspire to be the topic of the day, since the conference organized by “Proto Thema” and travel.gr at the “Grande Bretagne” hotel will host the Prime Minister, the U.S. Ambassador Gilfoyle, Hatzidakis, Papastavrou, Hardalias, the president of SEV Spyros Theodoropoulos, as well as dozens of distinguished Greek and foreign entrepreneurs, scientists, and public figures. Our theme is “The Intelligence Age: Travel, Culture and Connection.” Of particular interest is the open discussion about everything with Mitsotakis and the beloved actor Giannis Bezos. Today there will be yet another episode in the Tsipras–Vaxevanis saga, as the former’s publishing house filed for an injunction against the latter’s outlet to prevent it from publishing excerpts from the book that is due to be released in a few days. I asked my source why a politician and a journalist—who were inseparable during SYRIZA’s heyday, especially when that politician happened to be prime minister—have reached such extremes. Well, I was told that the relationship soured later, when Tsipras was in the opposition, and Vaxevanis feels he didn’t treat him well. These things happen—misunderstandings or friendships that break, especially in politics, and of course the full truth is known to the two sides themselves, not to the… audience, particularly when public figures are involved. What I want to say is that Tsipras, with his book and mainly with the “free dove” strategy, should have expected such clashes, bitterness, and distress. And this is only the beginning—when the book comes out, there will be much more, possibly much worse. In that sense, I don’t know whether he did the right thing, because it’s like taking an entire party onto the psychoanalyst’s couch. A lot of inner feelings will come out—especially from those who only five years ago thought they were “big shots,” while they were merely a product of a turbulent political period. Therefore, some from SYRIZA will throw stones at him and others will flatter him, hoping that through him they might find their way back to Parliament. On the other hand, the book has already secured crazy publicity—publicity I’m not sure it would have had otherwise. Good or bad, it’s still publicity, and perhaps at this stage that’s what matters most. Meanwhile, Nikos A. sits atop his successes and choices and enjoys them. What do I mean? Yesterday a PASOK MP from Chios, named Stavros Michailidis, appeared on TV and hinted that the firefighting planes announced by Mitsotakis are a scandal. “Why do we need these surveillance and data-recording aircraft when we live in the era of drones, and with a 19-seat capacity, at that?” the MP wondered. When the journalist told him that they are not 19-seaters but… regular aircraft, he replied: “I know, I know, because I’m from the Air Force. I read that they were 19-seaters—Mitsotakis wants to give someone a job.” What happened is that the MP, whose CV says he is a Rear Admiral of the Coast Guard (and not anything Air Force-related), read in the government announcement that the new aircraft consume far less fuel than a small 19-seat commercial airplane. As you can understand, Mr. Michailidis didn’t bother to read even a… simple announcement, yet he had time to go on TV and say his nonsense. What can the party leader do after that? I hear that today at noon, after K. M. crosses swords with Androulakis in “Prime Minister’s Question Time,” it is quite likely he will drop by the Members’ Lounge to chat with ND MPs. In the “blue” camp, things have always been worked out around a table, but K. M. avoids dinners. The in-person meeting between Kimberly Guilfoyle and Archbishop Ieronymos was particularly warm, and she revealed that he was the first person she had spoken to by phone before arriving. I’m told that Guilfoyle, who gives especially elegant gifts, brought the Archbishop a large silver coin custom-made for him. Their conversation was open and wide-ranging, while Ieronymos suggested they do a charitable tour in the coming months of the social structures supported by the Archdiocese—obviously in Attica, but also in Boeotia. He also proposed a joint visit to the Holy Monastery of Hosios Loukas, about which Ieronymos has written a book that has been translated into English and which he made sure to gift to the ambassador. After meeting the Archbishop, the ambassador went yesterday to the Ministry of Defense, where she was received by Dendias with the blue carpet they roll out for ambassadors and the ceremonial guard appropriate for the occasion. The interesting bit I hear is that Dendias is preparing to travel again early next week to the United States—this time to the West Coast, toward the San Francisco area. Each of his visits is linked with visits to facilities that produce and develop innovative weapons systems. The government may not officially confirm Zelensky’s arrival in Athens for security reasons—as is always the case—but I can’t help telling you that yesterday a group of Ukrainian advance staff made visits to the Presidency, Maximos Mansion, and Parliament, where he will go on Sunday. There were 13 people in total, from the Press Office, Protocol, and the Ukrainian Embassy, who were arranging details. Zelensky will have with him six close aides according to the plan. What no one should take for granted is the arrival time, which is provisionally listed as 12:30. And the previous time he came to Athens, then-president Sakellaropoulou had to wait for him for several hours, compared with the initial schedule. Yesterday in the parliamentary committees discussion began on Deputy Minister Marinakis’ bill for ERT, the first for public television in 12 years. SYRIZA and Popi Tsapanidou didn’t like the fact that order is finally being brought to the mess of uncollected license fees—in other words, our money—because, shockingly, the AADE will send notice letters to those who owe. Marinakis wasn’t wrong to say that the state must—finally—respect everyone, including the “suckers” who have been paying their taxes and contributions consistently all these years. After years, following the bill on the registry of print and online media, order is now being restored to issues of public broadcasting, and soon the matter of licenses for regional stations and for radio stations operating on temporary permits since 2002—back in Dimitris Reppas’ days—will also be resolved. Self-evident things… A longtime friend and sharp political observer called me yesterday to remind me that Nikos Nikolopoulos—who, through Nikos Karachalios, “spoke” with Karystianou back when SYRIZA-ANEL was in power—had, among other things, an obsession. What was it? The constant complaints through parliamentary questions about the infamous 717 contract. He constantly accused the companies involved of scandals and demanded that the contract be stopped. Need I say more? On Monday—barring unforeseen developments—it appears that Hellenic Exchanges (ATHEX) will have passed under the control of Euronext. What is circulating among the various parties involved in the deal is that the percentage Euronext seems likely to gather ranges between 54% and 56%. This, of course, remains to be confirmed on Monday afternoon, as the deadline has passed and institutionally there is no longer the possibility of either a time extension or a price adjustment. Everything suggests that the appropriate balances have been achieved at an institutional level. We’re not even talking about the domestic side, where mutual fund companies (AEDAK) bought and will tender their shares, brokerage firms did everything they could with their clients, and so on. And at the level of foreign institutional investors, it appears that the necessary understandings have been reached with the arbitrage funds (which have a weighted presence) as well as other institutional shareholders abroad. In contrast, where there seems to be some anxiety is regarding ATHEX’s retail shareholders, but I am not in a position to say whether this concern stems from genuinely low participation or whether it is part of an effort to mobilize more individual shareholders at the final moment of the tender offer so that the outcome can be presented as a bigger success. If the column had to place a bet, it would wager that next week ATHEX will belong to Euronext. What troubles the column is the following: If Euronext acquires ATHEX—as everything indicates—are there grounds for a faster-than-expected upgrade of the stock market? The agencies that handle such evaluations consider certain events as extraordinary (e.g., a capital increase for listed companies) and adjust their assessments. Obviously, a series of other parameters must be met simultaneously (which we do not know), and then the upgrade takes place automatically at that moment and not on scheduled dates. It is also possible that the agencies (MSCI, FTSE, etc.) may wait for the transition of the Athens Exchange to the Euronext platform to be completed, with the relevant decision coming in two or three months, as it is the intention of Euronext to proceed with a squeeze-out process as soon as possible and to complete it by mid-February 2026. The question is reasonable because JP Morgan and HSBC (who have insight into capital flows) do not consider that the upgrade will be a positive development for the Athens market, and beyond that, our previous experience with a past market upgrade can be summed up with the phrase “long-lasting trouble.” OTE’s CEO, Kostas Nebis, described as strategically important the deal with GEK TERNA and Grid Telecom to acquire 100% of TERNA Fiber, which manages 7 out of the 10 geographical zones of the Ultra-Fast Broadband (UFBB) project, with OTE having undertaken the remaining three. This is a major PPP project, with a budget of €743 million (€921 million including VAT), of which €250 million is co-financed public expenditure, and the rest will be covered by private capital. Since 2023, OTE has been implementing the project in three geographical zones, and with the completion of the above agreements, OTE will assume the entire project, with the concession period (service period), before the infrastructure is transferred to the State, amounting to 23 years. Speaking to analysts, Nebis stressed that OTE could not allow the project to potentially end up in the hands of competitors when it had already undertaken 3 out of 10 areas, as it concerns around half a million households in semi-urban and rural areas of the country, in networks where OTE already holds the lion’s share of the market. As for OTE’s results, what matters is the positive revision of its 2025 cash-flow guidance to €530 million from €460 million previously, something clearly beneficial for shareholders. Shareholders will receive a special dividend of €0.10 per share due to the sale of the subsidiary Telekom Romania Mobile Communications, but the most important aspect of this sale is that OTE stops “bleeding” because of Romania. The stock closed yesterday down 3% at €16.4 on a very strong day for the market, but such behaviours are likely to reappear in various stocks as we are in a period of weight adjustments ahead of MSCI Greece’s rebalancing on November 24. It is also possible that the lack of enthusiasm on the Athens market for OTE’s share was caused by a line item of +€52 million in the third-quarter financial statements titled “extraordinary deferred tax,” whereas last year there was a tax expense of -€48.5 million. Additionally, pre-tax results are 12% lower on a comparable basis without tax burdens/benefits. In any case, OTE’s stock is a dividend-yielding investment choice and not a technological growth story. OTE remains the sixth-heaviest stock on the Athens Exchange, with a market capitalization exceeding €6.2 billion. It does not disappoint with its performance but does not attract aggressive buyers seeking quick returns by year-end. And since we mentioned above the OTE–GEK TERNA deal and noted yesterday that Australian infrastructure funds are investing in the listed company, let us add that substantial and careful groundwork preceded the effort to attract these specific investors. Specifically, everything started in early autumn, when BlackRock hosted a closed investment event at the Stavros Niarchos Foundation Cultural Center, where GEK TERNA’s prospects were presented. The event had very strict attendance and participation rules, photography was forbidden, the meetings were confidential, and the event was not widely publicized. At that time, representatives of two large Australian infrastructure-investment funds (4D Infrastructure Group with $13 billion AUM and Resolution Capital with €17 billion AUM) approached management and requested further information. A small group of GEK TERNA executives travelled to Australia, made the necessary presentations, and provided answers and data. The first two funds brought in additional interested investors from the distant continent, and the result is becoming evident these days. GEK TERNA has already surpassed a market capitalization of €2.5 billion, but even more important is the increase in trading volume, while the rise in the share price follows a clear “professional” pattern. Only a few days after his brief but notable presence in Athens at the P-TEC conference, U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright returned to the spotlight, this time opening the annual conference of the American Nuclear Society. And although he did not directly mention Greece or the discussions he held in the Greek capital, his references to “broader energy strategies” and “collaboration with friendly nations” did not go unnoticed by those in the know. In energy-sector circles, it is widely considered that Athens did not appear on his recent schedule by chance. With Greece seeking to position itself as a hub of energy security and technological innovation in the region, Wright’s indirect references to the need to harness artificial intelligence and small modular reactors (SMRs) fuel speculation about potential U.S. support—or at least knowledge transfer—to the Greek side, particularly in areas that touch industry and data centers. The Secretary made sure to set the tone of the new era: “If we want to lead in AI, we must rapidly accelerate the development of electricity generation,” he said, implying that artificial intelligence and nuclear energy will be the two pillars of American energy supremacy. Behind the scenes, his presence in Athens is said to have opened channels of communication with members of the Greek government and energy-market executives, at a moment when the U.S. views Greece not only as a gateway to the Eastern Mediterranean but also as a potential ground for technological pilot projects. The cycle of speedboat services to the islands has come to a close, marking the end of a period during which the islands—especially in the peak months—were served with additional routes beyond the conventional ones, facilitating both residents and visitors. Connections continue with conventional vessels, which, however, do not fully cover the needs of islanders, particularly in terms of frequency and speed of routes. At the same time, freight traffic is being served normally by cargo vessels, which maintain a steady presence in the port. The issue of the second inter-Cycladic route, which had been discussed at times, seems to have moved to the background. The inter-Cycladic line is the maritime service that connects the islands with one another without necessarily passing through major mainland ports. Beyond the primary basic link, there is a need for an additional route or a second vessel to meet demand and provide an alternative option—for example, when one vessel is immobilized or when needs are increased. We therefore await decisions for the next season. The trading week began with the General Index at 1,986.89 points. Yesterday marked the 4th consecutive upward session of the week, closing at 2,074 points—already a rise of over +4%. Such a rise had not been seen since the pleasant days of summer, when under the August heat the General Index broke through the 2,000-point “barrier.” All of this took place yesterday without the help of foreign stock markets, which were drifting in negative territory, with New York futures also signalling negative sentiment. Awaiting Fitch’s credit rating review of the Greek economy tonight, the General Index closed yesterday with gains of +1.44% at 2,074.96 points, while today it traded between 2,057.70 points (+0.20%) and 2,083.31 points (+1.45%). Trading value— the highest of the four-day rally—reached €255.9 million, with block trades worth €18.4 million. Eurobank (+3.09% at €3.5) and Piraeus (+3.03% at €7.14) set the pace for the session, followed by Athens International Airport (+2.81% at €10.23), Bank of Cyprus (+2.5% at €8.2), Helleniq Energy (+2.24% at €8.2), TITAN (+2.12% at €43.35), and Metlen (+2.11% at €43.5). Gains above 1% were also recorded by PPC, Alpha Bank, Optima Bank, and Motor Oil. In mid-cap stocks, ADMIE stood out (+4.58% at €3.08) following the Greek–Cypriot summit, as did Austriacard (+2.14% at €5.26 after its 9-month results announcement) and the Thessaloniki Port Authority (+2.84% at €35). The Greek company Theon, listed on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange, is expecting—any day now—the German parliament’s decision on the €1-billion contract for the supply of 100,000 night-vision devices (NVG) by Theon and the German firm Hensoldt. This sheds light on Christian Hadjiminas’ decision to acquire 9.8% of the French company Exosens in October—an acquisition analysts considered an “expensive investment for a minority stake.” Through this move, Theon secured the supply of the critical 16mm image-intensifier tubes (IIT) it needs just before European demand surges. Exosens is the only manufacturer outside the U.S. that has invested in 16mm tubes. American manufacturers L3Harris and Elbit Systems of America are committed to replacing 400,000 units for the U.S. Army and cannot export their superior 18mm tubes outside the U.S. This leaves the European— and also the Saudi—market to Theon and smaller competitors. In 2026, Theon will invest €10 million to expand its production facility in Koropi. With five “name-brand” institutional portfolios in its shareholder register, TREK Development begins its journey on the Alternative Market of the Athens Stock Exchange (ENA+). Next Monday, the opening bell of the trading session will be rung by Dinos Papapolyzos, who has already completed three decades in infrastructure project development and financing, as well as in the construction of specialized projects in Energy, Energy Efficiency, and Smart Technologies (Smart Water & Smart Cities). With a turnover of around €4 million, zero debt, and first-half profits of €560,000, TREK Development will list 17.4% of its share capital on the stock exchange, with an initial trading price of €1.4 per share. Seventy-four percent of the listed shares were covered by institutional funds as well as entrepreneurs. The Turkish defense company Aselsan has secured yet another €1.1-billion contract for the Steel Dome program. This is its second major order for 2025, after the €1.65-billion agreement in September, while this year alone Aselsan has signed contracts worth $7.6 billion—an all-time record. Turkey is accelerating the Steel Dome, a fully AI-driven integrated air-defense network. Aselsan is now investing $1.5 billion in Ankara for new production facilities aimed at creating Europe’s largest air-defense systems plant by 2032. This reveals the real backdrop behind the recent visits of the British Prime Minister and the German Chancellor to Ankara. Aselsan has already been invited to design phases of NATO’s new GBAD and Germany’s ESSI, which aims to link all European air-defense systems. GBAD (Ground-Based Air Defence) is NATO’s ground-based system protecting against aerial and missile threats. The German ESSI (European Sky Shield Initiative) is a German project launched in 2022 to build a unified European air-defense system. The conclusion? With Europe’s defense industry lacking production capacity and the EU’s “Drone Wall” needing immediate solutions, Turkey appears to be positioning itself as Europe’s de facto air-defense provider. Seventeen full years have passed since the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis that led to Lehman Brothers’ collapse and a global financial meltdown. Today, subprime loans—loans to borrowers with low credit ratings—threaten the U.S. economy not through housing but through the auto market. The percentage of low-credit-score borrowers more than 60 days behind on payments skyrocketed to 6.65% in October, the highest level in 31 years. The collapse of Tricolor Holdings, the largest subprime auto lender, acted as a catalyst that forced major financial institutions to reassess their overall exposure to the sector. The strategic restructuring that banks are undertaking in subprime auto loans may become the next major problem. If they attempt complex loan securitizations with high yields in a liquidity-rich market hungry for returns, then history may repeat itself on a smaller scale. Risk-shifting to smaller lenders and tightening lending criteria are already underway. Explore related questions

Title: Tucker to Release Information on Butler Assassination – Here’s Our List of What is Missing

Skip to comments. Posted on 11/14/2025 9:20:13 AM PST by Red Badger Tucker Carlson to announce his findings related to the assassination attempt of President Trump in Butler on Friday night. Here is a list of items that are still outstanding. We’ve been saying since the assassination attempt that many questions are still open. Bannon shared Tucker’s tweet on GETTR. On Twitter and X, a similar report was made. We really don’t know anything about Thomas Crooks, the alleged assassin of President Trump in Bultler, PA, on July 13, 2024. Tucker will be addressing this in a show on Friday. Wall Street Apes shares this: BREAKING: Tucker Carlson announces he is releasing evidence tomorrow proving the FBI is lying about the assassination attempt on Donald Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania by Thomas Crooks Joe Rogan and Elon Musk pointed out the INSANE inconsistencies – The assassins house was PROFESSIONALLY scrubbed – His home was scrubbed so well there wasn’t even silverware left in the home – No footprint on the internet – No social media footprint (completely wiped) – He was in a BlackRock commercial – Joe Rogan says some individuals inside BlackRock may have “recognized that it’s beneficial to them if he gets assassinated” – There was never a formal report – There was never press conferences where they detailed all the information they know currently and where the investigation stands at the moment – He was a very young g kid there with a rangefinder (used to measure distances, very suspicious) – CNN streamed it live, which Joe Rogan does not believe they did for any other rally. And certainly not for a rally that’s in the middle of nowhere in Pennsylvania – They wouldn’t let people be on that roof because the Secret service lady said it was sloped and it was dangerous – The snipers that were on the other roof was a, a steeper pitch (It made no f*cking sense) – Random people saw him and pointed him out on the roof with a gun for a long time before it happened – The kid had 5 phones – His body was immediately cremated – There was some indications that there was a phone that had been traveling from outside the FBI offices in D.C to where this kid lived multiple times We need answers. We provided a report from AbleChild last week that included a list of outstanding items related to Butler. There’s lots to be concerned about beginning with the identification of the alleged shooter. How was Thomas Matthew Crooks identified, either by the Butler County Coroner or the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME)? The fact is the document that has been made public by the Butler Coroner, William F. Young III, is incorrect. Contrary to July 13th being the day the Butler County coroner viewed the body of the alleged shooter; Coroner Young did not view the body of the alleged shooter that lay on the AGR Building until 6a.m on July 14th. Further, the Allegheny County Medical Examiner also does not provide the investigative method used to identify the body of the alleged shooter, Crooks. Why? Why does neither of the men who handled the alleged shooter’s body, provide documentation as to its the identity, you know, maybe DNA? It seems odd, especially in light of the fact that the alleged shooter’s body lay on the AGR building roof all night with no mention as to what investigative entity had evidentiary control over the body. Eric may want to know if the Butler County Coroner wrote investigative notes about the crime scene, position of body, was alleged weapon still on the roof, what documentation was found on the deceased and were photographs taken before transport to Allegheny County? The President and his son may want to know about the ballistics associated with the alleged attempted assassination. For example, the House Task Force on the Attempted Assassination of Donald J. Trump, reports that the Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Pittsburgh Field Office stated, “all reviewable evidence collected from the AGR roof and from the subject’s body are consistent with the round fired by the Secret Service sniper.” First, what was the evidence collected from the AGR roof, and the round fired and collected from the alleged shooter’s body is only “consistent” with the round fired by the sniper? The round fired by the sniper either matches the sniper’s weapon or it doesn’t. Of course, the ballistics report that the FBI surely has completed would provide detailed information about the recovered projectiles. And this says nothing about the need for evidence about projectiles recovered that allegedly were fired at Trump and recovered from the late Corey Comperatore. Do those recovered projectiles match Crooks’ alleged weapon or are they just “consistent” with that type of projectile fired from the alleged weapon? So far, there is no physical evidence that has been made public that reveals how Crooks was identified as the alleged shooter nor any evidence that proves that Crooks held or fired the alleged weapon. And there is no physical evidence publicly available that proves that the projectiles that allegedly hit the President and others in the crowd match Crooks alleged weapon. The FBI ballistics report, if ever released, should answer all of the ballistics questions and, perhaps, provide conclusive detail about the identification of the alleged shooter. Other physical evidence that may be of interest to the President’s son deals with the tests conducted by the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME). Based on the information provided by the ME, it appears he failed to test the alleged shooter’s body for prescription psychiatric drugs. Studies show that blood tests are not sufficient to detect all psychiatric drugs and the ME does not provide detailed information about what prescription drug tests were conducted if any. Why? Was the alleged shooter taking psychiatric drugs? That information may never be known as Crooks body was cremated within days of the shooting. Moving along, Eric Trump may also want to know how Crooks’ parents, behavioral health experts, failed to realize their son was building bombs in his basement bedroom. It has been reported that Crooks’ father told investigators that within a year of the shooting, he had observed his son “dancing in his bedroom throughout the night.” Did Crooks’ dad ask why he was dancing in his bedroom throughout the night? Who knows. But it seems odd that behavioral health experts failed to notice that bomb making items were being delivered to their home and their son was making bombs in his bedroom, acting strangely and never thought to question this behavior. The FBI investigation would surely provide detailed information about the parent’s possible role in the assassination attempt. Afterall, it was Crooks’ father that provided the weapon allegedly used in the shooting. One would feel confident that the FBI had lots of questions for these seemingly out of touch mental health experts. Let’s be honest, one would assume the President need only ask his FBI Director, Kash Patel or maybe Dan Bongino, for a copy of the investigation. According to an interview that Patel and Bongino gave to Fox News host Maria Bartiromo last May, there are two reasons the investigation cannot be released. First says Patel, “two open, on going prosecutions… we can’t get ahead of the federal court case.” It would have been extremely informative, but Bartiromo did not bother to ask what the two federal cases were. Nevertheless, Patel assured Bartiromo that “we have both seen the firearm and physically held it.” What does that mean? Who cares if Patel and Bongino held the weapon? What’s important is whether Crook’s DNA and fingerprints are on the weapon, and did the recovered projectiles match that weapon? Bongino was even more insulting when he explained to Bartiromo that “I’m not going to tell people what they want to hear. I’m going to tell people the truth.” Bongino said that there is no ‘there’ there. “If it was there,” said Bongino, “we would have told you.” Well, meh…apparently not. With all due respect to Bongino and Patel, the FBI has failed to provide any update since August of 2024…a month after the shooting.” The FBI has the physical evidence and, yet, more than a year after the assassination attempt, the public still has not been provided the physical evidence that proves whether Crooks was or wasn’t the shooter. But the FBI isn’t alone in its refusal to release investigative information about the assassination attempt. The Pennsylvania State Police refuse to release its report on the shooting incident, the Butler Coroner has not released his death investigation notes, the House Task Force has not released any of the physical evidence mentioned in its report so what’s the big secret? Let’s see what Tucker can provide us because the FBI/DOJ/Secret Service/etc are failing us in this regard.

We really don’t know anything about Thomas Crooks, the alleged assassin of President Trump in Bultler, PA, on July 13, 2024. Tucker will be addressing this in a show on Friday. Wall Street Apes shares this: BREAKING: Tucker Carlson announces he is releasing evidence tomorrow proving the FBI is lying about the assassination attempt on Donald Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania by Thomas Crooks Joe Rogan and Elon Musk pointed out the INSANE inconsistencies – The assassins house was PROFESSIONALLY scrubbed – His home was scrubbed so well there wasn’t even silverware left in the home – No footprint on the internet – No social media footprint (completely wiped) – He was in a BlackRock commercial – Joe Rogan says some individuals inside BlackRock may have “recognized that it’s beneficial to them if he gets assassinated” – There was never a formal report – There was never press conferences where they detailed all the information they know currently and where the investigation stands at the moment – He was a very young g kid there with a rangefinder (used to measure distances, very suspicious) – CNN streamed it live, which Joe Rogan does not believe they did for any other rally. And certainly not for a rally that’s in the middle of nowhere in Pennsylvania – They wouldn’t let people be on that roof because the Secret service lady said it was sloped and it was dangerous – The snipers that were on the other roof was a, a steeper pitch (It made no f*cking sense) – Random people saw him and pointed him out on the roof with a gun for a long time before it happened – The kid had 5 phones – His body was immediately cremated – There was some indications that there was a phone that had been traveling from outside the FBI offices in D.C to where this kid lived multiple times We need answers. We provided a report from AbleChild last week that included a list of outstanding items related to Butler. There’s lots to be concerned about beginning with the identification of the alleged shooter. How was Thomas Matthew Crooks identified, either by the Butler County Coroner or the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME)? The fact is the document that has been made public by the Butler Coroner, William F. Young III, is incorrect. Contrary to July 13th being the day the Butler County coroner viewed the body of the alleged shooter; Coroner Young did not view the body of the alleged shooter that lay on the AGR Building until 6a.m on July 14th. Further, the Allegheny County Medical Examiner also does not provide the investigative method used to identify the body of the alleged shooter, Crooks. Why? Why does neither of the men who handled the alleged shooter’s body, provide documentation as to its the identity, you know, maybe DNA? It seems odd, especially in light of the fact that the alleged shooter’s body lay on the AGR building roof all night with no mention as to what investigative entity had evidentiary control over the body. Eric may want to know if the Butler County Coroner wrote investigative notes about the crime scene, position of body, was alleged weapon still on the roof, what documentation was found on the deceased and were photographs taken before transport to Allegheny County? The President and his son may want to know about the ballistics associated with the alleged attempted assassination. For example, the House Task Force on the Attempted Assassination of Donald J. Trump, reports that the Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Pittsburgh Field Office stated, “all reviewable evidence collected from the AGR roof and from the subject’s body are consistent with the round fired by the Secret Service sniper.” First, what was the evidence collected from the AGR roof, and the round fired and collected from the alleged shooter’s body is only “consistent” with the round fired by the sniper? The round fired by the sniper either matches the sniper’s weapon or it doesn’t. Of course, the ballistics report that the FBI surely has completed would provide detailed information about the recovered projectiles. And this says nothing about the need for evidence about projectiles recovered that allegedly were fired at Trump and recovered from the late Corey Comperatore. Do those recovered projectiles match Crooks’ alleged weapon or are they just “consistent” with that type of projectile fired from the alleged weapon? So far, there is no physical evidence that has been made public that reveals how Crooks was identified as the alleged shooter nor any evidence that proves that Crooks held or fired the alleged weapon. And there is no physical evidence publicly available that proves that the projectiles that allegedly hit the President and others in the crowd match Crooks alleged weapon. The FBI ballistics report, if ever released, should answer all of the ballistics questions and, perhaps, provide conclusive detail about the identification of the alleged shooter. Other physical evidence that may be of interest to the President’s son deals with the tests conducted by the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME). Based on the information provided by the ME, it appears he failed to test the alleged shooter’s body for prescription psychiatric drugs. Studies show that blood tests are not sufficient to detect all psychiatric drugs and the ME does not provide detailed information about what prescription drug tests were conducted if any. Why? Was the alleged shooter taking psychiatric drugs? That information may never be known as Crooks body was cremated within days of the shooting. Moving along, Eric Trump may also want to know how Crooks’ parents, behavioral health experts, failed to realize their son was building bombs in his basement bedroom. It has been reported that Crooks’ father told investigators that within a year of the shooting, he had observed his son “dancing in his bedroom throughout the night.” Did Crooks’ dad ask why he was dancing in his bedroom throughout the night? Who knows. But it seems odd that behavioral health experts failed to notice that bomb making items were being delivered to their home and their son was making bombs in his bedroom, acting strangely and never thought to question this behavior. The FBI investigation would surely provide detailed information about the parent’s possible role in the assassination attempt. Afterall, it was Crooks’ father that provided the weapon allegedly used in the shooting. One would feel confident that the FBI had lots of questions for these seemingly out of touch mental health experts. Let’s be honest, one would assume the President need only ask his FBI Director, Kash Patel or maybe Dan Bongino, for a copy of the investigation. According to an interview that Patel and Bongino gave to Fox News host Maria Bartiromo last May, there are two reasons the investigation cannot be released. First says Patel, “two open, on going prosecutions… we can’t get ahead of the federal court case.” It would have been extremely informative, but Bartiromo did not bother to ask what the two federal cases were. Nevertheless, Patel assured Bartiromo that “we have both seen the firearm and physically held it.” What does that mean? Who cares if Patel and Bongino held the weapon? What’s important is whether Crook’s DNA and fingerprints are on the weapon, and did the recovered projectiles match that weapon? Bongino was even more insulting when he explained to Bartiromo that “I’m not going to tell people what they want to hear. I’m going to tell people the truth.” Bongino said that there is no ‘there’ there. “If it was there,” said Bongino, “we would have told you.” Well, meh…apparently not. With all due respect to Bongino and Patel, the FBI has failed to provide any update since August of 2024…a month after the shooting.” The FBI has the physical evidence and, yet, more than a year after the assassination attempt, the public still has not been provided the physical evidence that proves whether Crooks was or wasn’t the shooter. But the FBI isn’t alone in its refusal to release investigative information about the assassination attempt. The Pennsylvania State Police refuse to release its report on the shooting incident, the Butler Coroner has not released his death investigation notes, the House Task Force has not released any of the physical evidence mentioned in its report so what’s the big secret? Let’s see what Tucker can provide us because the FBI/DOJ/Secret Service/etc are failing us in this regard.

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson BREAKING: Tucker Carlson announces he is releasing evidence tomorrow proving the FBI is lying about the assassination attempt on Donald Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania by Thomas Crooks Joe Rogan and Elon Musk pointed out the INSANE inconsistencies – The assassins house was PROFESSIONALLY scrubbed – His home was scrubbed so well there wasn’t even silverware left in the home – No footprint on the internet – No social media footprint (completely wiped) – He was in a BlackRock commercial – Joe Rogan says some individuals inside BlackRock may have “recognized that it’s beneficial to them if he gets assassinated” – There was never a formal report – There was never press conferences where they detailed all the information they know currently and where the investigation stands at the moment – He was a very young g kid there with a rangefinder (used to measure distances, very suspicious) – CNN streamed it live, which Joe Rogan does not believe they did for any other rally. And certainly not for a rally that’s in the middle of nowhere in Pennsylvania – They wouldn’t let people be on that roof because the Secret service lady said it was sloped and it was dangerous – The snipers that were on the other roof was a, a steeper pitch (It made no f*cking sense) – Random people saw him and pointed him out on the roof with a gun for a long time before it happened – The kid had 5 phones – His body was immediately cremated – There was some indications that there was a phone that had been traveling from outside the FBI offices in D.C to where this kid lived multiple times We need answers. We provided a report from AbleChild last week that included a list of outstanding items related to Butler. There’s lots to be concerned about beginning with the identification of the alleged shooter. How was Thomas Matthew Crooks identified, either by the Butler County Coroner or the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME)? The fact is the document that has been made public by the Butler Coroner, William F. Young III, is incorrect. Contrary to July 13th being the day the Butler County coroner viewed the body of the alleged shooter; Coroner Young did not view the body of the alleged shooter that lay on the AGR Building until 6a.m on July 14th. Further, the Allegheny County Medical Examiner also does not provide the investigative method used to identify the body of the alleged shooter, Crooks. Why? Why does neither of the men who handled the alleged shooter’s body, provide documentation as to its the identity, you know, maybe DNA? It seems odd, especially in light of the fact that the alleged shooter’s body lay on the AGR building roof all night with no mention as to what investigative entity had evidentiary control over the body. Eric may want to know if the Butler County Coroner wrote investigative notes about the crime scene, position of body, was alleged weapon still on the roof, what documentation was found on the deceased and were photographs taken before transport to Allegheny County? The President and his son may want to know about the ballistics associated with the alleged attempted assassination. For example, the House Task Force on the Attempted Assassination of Donald J. Trump, reports that the Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Pittsburgh Field Office stated, “all reviewable evidence collected from the AGR roof and from the subject’s body are consistent with the round fired by the Secret Service sniper.” First, what was the evidence collected from the AGR roof, and the round fired and collected from the alleged shooter’s body is only “consistent” with the round fired by the sniper? The round fired by the sniper either matches the sniper’s weapon or it doesn’t. Of course, the ballistics report that the FBI surely has completed would provide detailed information about the recovered projectiles. And this says nothing about the need for evidence about projectiles recovered that allegedly were fired at Trump and recovered from the late Corey Comperatore. Do those recovered projectiles match Crooks’ alleged weapon or are they just “consistent” with that type of projectile fired from the alleged weapon? So far, there is no physical evidence that has been made public that reveals how Crooks was identified as the alleged shooter nor any evidence that proves that Crooks held or fired the alleged weapon. And there is no physical evidence publicly available that proves that the projectiles that allegedly hit the President and others in the crowd match Crooks alleged weapon. The FBI ballistics report, if ever released, should answer all of the ballistics questions and, perhaps, provide conclusive detail about the identification of the alleged shooter. Other physical evidence that may be of interest to the President’s son deals with the tests conducted by the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME). Based on the information provided by the ME, it appears he failed to test the alleged shooter’s body for prescription psychiatric drugs. Studies show that blood tests are not sufficient to detect all psychiatric drugs and the ME does not provide detailed information about what prescription drug tests were conducted if any. Why? Was the alleged shooter taking psychiatric drugs? That information may never be known as Crooks body was cremated within days of the shooting. Moving along, Eric Trump may also want to know how Crooks’ parents, behavioral health experts, failed to realize their son was building bombs in his basement bedroom. It has been reported that Crooks’ father told investigators that within a year of the shooting, he had observed his son “dancing in his bedroom throughout the night.” Did Crooks’ dad ask why he was dancing in his bedroom throughout the night? Who knows. But it seems odd that behavioral health experts failed to notice that bomb making items were being delivered to their home and their son was making bombs in his bedroom, acting strangely and never thought to question this behavior. The FBI investigation would surely provide detailed information about the parent’s possible role in the assassination attempt. Afterall, it was Crooks’ father that provided the weapon allegedly used in the shooting. One would feel confident that the FBI had lots of questions for these seemingly out of touch mental health experts. Let’s be honest, one would assume the President need only ask his FBI Director, Kash Patel or maybe Dan Bongino, for a copy of the investigation. According to an interview that Patel and Bongino gave to Fox News host Maria Bartiromo last May, there are two reasons the investigation cannot be released. First says Patel, “two open, on going prosecutions… we can’t get ahead of the federal court case.” It would have been extremely informative, but Bartiromo did not bother to ask what the two federal cases were. Nevertheless, Patel assured Bartiromo that “we have both seen the firearm and physically held it.” What does that mean? Who cares if Patel and Bongino held the weapon? What’s important is whether Crook’s DNA and fingerprints are on the weapon, and did the recovered projectiles match that weapon? Bongino was even more insulting when he explained to Bartiromo that “I’m not going to tell people what they want to hear. I’m going to tell people the truth.” Bongino said that there is no ‘there’ there. “If it was there,” said Bongino, “we would have told you.” Well, meh…apparently not. With all due respect to Bongino and Patel, the FBI has failed to provide any update since August of 2024…a month after the shooting.” The FBI has the physical evidence and, yet, more than a year after the assassination attempt, the public still has not been provided the physical evidence that proves whether Crooks was or wasn’t the shooter. But the FBI isn’t alone in its refusal to release investigative information about the assassination attempt. The Pennsylvania State Police refuse to release its report on the shooting incident, the Butler Coroner has not released his death investigation notes, the House Task Force has not released any of the physical evidence mentioned in its report so what’s the big secret? Let’s see what Tucker can provide us because the FBI/DOJ/Secret Service/etc are failing us in this regard.

We provided a report from AbleChild last week that included a list of outstanding items related to Butler. There’s lots to be concerned about beginning with the identification of the alleged shooter. How was Thomas Matthew Crooks identified, either by the Butler County Coroner or the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME)? The fact is the document that has been made public by the Butler Coroner, William F. Young III, is incorrect. Contrary to July 13th being the day the Butler County coroner viewed the body of the alleged shooter; Coroner Young did not view the body of the alleged shooter that lay on the AGR Building until 6a.m on July 14th. Further, the Allegheny County Medical Examiner also does not provide the investigative method used to identify the body of the alleged shooter, Crooks. Why? Why does neither of the men who handled the alleged shooter’s body, provide documentation as to its the identity, you know, maybe DNA? It seems odd, especially in light of the fact that the alleged shooter’s body lay on the AGR building roof all night with no mention as to what investigative entity had evidentiary control over the body. Eric may want to know if the Butler County Coroner wrote investigative notes about the crime scene, position of body, was alleged weapon still on the roof, what documentation was found on the deceased and were photographs taken before transport to Allegheny County? The President and his son may want to know about the ballistics associated with the alleged attempted assassination. For example, the House Task Force on the Attempted Assassination of Donald J. Trump, reports that the Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Pittsburgh Field Office stated, “all reviewable evidence collected from the AGR roof and from the subject’s body are consistent with the round fired by the Secret Service sniper.” First, what was the evidence collected from the AGR roof, and the round fired and collected from the alleged shooter’s body is only “consistent” with the round fired by the sniper? The round fired by the sniper either matches the sniper’s weapon or it doesn’t. Of course, the ballistics report that the FBI surely has completed would provide detailed information about the recovered projectiles. And this says nothing about the need for evidence about projectiles recovered that allegedly were fired at Trump and recovered from the late Corey Comperatore. Do those recovered projectiles match Crooks’ alleged weapon or are they just “consistent” with that type of projectile fired from the alleged weapon? So far, there is no physical evidence that has been made public that reveals how Crooks was identified as the alleged shooter nor any evidence that proves that Crooks held or fired the alleged weapon. And there is no physical evidence publicly available that proves that the projectiles that allegedly hit the President and others in the crowd match Crooks alleged weapon. The FBI ballistics report, if ever released, should answer all of the ballistics questions and, perhaps, provide conclusive detail about the identification of the alleged shooter. Other physical evidence that may be of interest to the President’s son deals with the tests conducted by the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME). Based on the information provided by the ME, it appears he failed to test the alleged shooter’s body for prescription psychiatric drugs. Studies show that blood tests are not sufficient to detect all psychiatric drugs and the ME does not provide detailed information about what prescription drug tests were conducted if any. Why? Was the alleged shooter taking psychiatric drugs? That information may never be known as Crooks body was cremated within days of the shooting. Moving along, Eric Trump may also want to know how Crooks’ parents, behavioral health experts, failed to realize their son was building bombs in his basement bedroom. It has been reported that Crooks’ father told investigators that within a year of the shooting, he had observed his son “dancing in his bedroom throughout the night.” Did Crooks’ dad ask why he was dancing in his bedroom throughout the night? Who knows. But it seems odd that behavioral health experts failed to notice that bomb making items were being delivered to their home and their son was making bombs in his bedroom, acting strangely and never thought to question this behavior. The FBI investigation would surely provide detailed information about the parent’s possible role in the assassination attempt. Afterall, it was Crooks’ father that provided the weapon allegedly used in the shooting. One would feel confident that the FBI had lots of questions for these seemingly out of touch mental health experts. Let’s be honest, one would assume the President need only ask his FBI Director, Kash Patel or maybe Dan Bongino, for a copy of the investigation. According to an interview that Patel and Bongino gave to Fox News host Maria Bartiromo last May, there are two reasons the investigation cannot be released. First says Patel, “two open, on going prosecutions… we can’t get ahead of the federal court case.” It would have been extremely informative, but Bartiromo did not bother to ask what the two federal cases were. Nevertheless, Patel assured Bartiromo that “we have both seen the firearm and physically held it.” What does that mean? Who cares if Patel and Bongino held the weapon? What’s important is whether Crook’s DNA and fingerprints are on the weapon, and did the recovered projectiles match that weapon? Bongino was even more insulting when he explained to Bartiromo that “I’m not going to tell people what they want to hear. I’m going to tell people the truth.” Bongino said that there is no ‘there’ there. “If it was there,” said Bongino, “we would have told you.” Well, meh…apparently not. With all due respect to Bongino and Patel, the FBI has failed to provide any update since August of 2024…a month after the shooting.” The FBI has the physical evidence and, yet, more than a year after the assassination attempt, the public still has not been provided the physical evidence that proves whether Crooks was or wasn’t the shooter. But the FBI isn’t alone in its refusal to release investigative information about the assassination attempt. The Pennsylvania State Police refuse to release its report on the shooting incident, the Butler Coroner has not released his death investigation notes, the House Task Force has not released any of the physical evidence mentioned in its report so what’s the big secret? Let’s see what Tucker can provide us because the FBI/DOJ/Secret Service/etc are failing us in this regard.

We provided a report from AbleChild last week that included a list of outstanding items related to Butler. There’s lots to be concerned about beginning with the identification of the alleged shooter. How was Thomas Matthew Crooks identified, either by the Butler County Coroner or the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME)? The fact is the document that has been made public by the Butler Coroner, William F. Young III, is incorrect. Contrary to July 13th being the day the Butler County coroner viewed the body of the alleged shooter; Coroner Young did not view the body of the alleged shooter that lay on the AGR Building until 6a.m on July 14th. Further, the Allegheny County Medical Examiner also does not provide the investigative method used to identify the body of the alleged shooter, Crooks. Why? Why does neither of the men who handled the alleged shooter’s body, provide documentation as to its the identity, you know, maybe DNA? It seems odd, especially in light of the fact that the alleged shooter’s body lay on the AGR building roof all night with no mention as to what investigative entity had evidentiary control over the body. Eric may want to know if the Butler County Coroner wrote investigative notes about the crime scene, position of body, was alleged weapon still on the roof, what documentation was found on the deceased and were photographs taken before transport to Allegheny County? The President and his son may want to know about the ballistics associated with the alleged attempted assassination. For example, the House Task Force on the Attempted Assassination of Donald J. Trump, reports that the Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Pittsburgh Field Office stated, “all reviewable evidence collected from the AGR roof and from the subject’s body are consistent with the round fired by the Secret Service sniper.” First, what was the evidence collected from the AGR roof, and the round fired and collected from the alleged shooter’s body is only “consistent” with the round fired by the sniper? The round fired by the sniper either matches the sniper’s weapon or it doesn’t. Of course, the ballistics report that the FBI surely has completed would provide detailed information about the recovered projectiles. And this says nothing about the need for evidence about projectiles recovered that allegedly were fired at Trump and recovered from the late Corey Comperatore. Do those recovered projectiles match Crooks’ alleged weapon or are they just “consistent” with that type of projectile fired from the alleged weapon? So far, there is no physical evidence that has been made public that reveals how Crooks was identified as the alleged shooter nor any evidence that proves that Crooks held or fired the alleged weapon. And there is no physical evidence publicly available that proves that the projectiles that allegedly hit the President and others in the crowd match Crooks alleged weapon. The FBI ballistics report, if ever released, should answer all of the ballistics questions and, perhaps, provide conclusive detail about the identification of the alleged shooter. Other physical evidence that may be of interest to the President’s son deals with the tests conducted by the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME). Based on the information provided by the ME, it appears he failed to test the alleged shooter’s body for prescription psychiatric drugs. Studies show that blood tests are not sufficient to detect all psychiatric drugs and the ME does not provide detailed information about what prescription drug tests were conducted if any. Why? Was the alleged shooter taking psychiatric drugs? That information may never be known as Crooks body was cremated within days of the shooting. Moving along, Eric Trump may also want to know how Crooks’ parents, behavioral health experts, failed to realize their son was building bombs in his basement bedroom. It has been reported that Crooks’ father told investigators that within a year of the shooting, he had observed his son “dancing in his bedroom throughout the night.” Did Crooks’ dad ask why he was dancing in his bedroom throughout the night? Who knows. But it seems odd that behavioral health experts failed to notice that bomb making items were being delivered to their home and their son was making bombs in his bedroom, acting strangely and never thought to question this behavior. The FBI investigation would surely provide detailed information about the parent’s possible role in the assassination attempt. Afterall, it was Crooks’ father that provided the weapon allegedly used in the shooting. One would feel confident that the FBI had lots of questions for these seemingly out of touch mental health experts. Let’s be honest, one would assume the President need only ask his FBI Director, Kash Patel or maybe Dan Bongino, for a copy of the investigation. According to an interview that Patel and Bongino gave to Fox News host Maria Bartiromo last May, there are two reasons the investigation cannot be released. First says Patel, “two open, on going prosecutions… we can’t get ahead of the federal court case.” It would have been extremely informative, but Bartiromo did not bother to ask what the two federal cases were. Nevertheless, Patel assured Bartiromo that “we have both seen the firearm and physically held it.” What does that mean? Who cares if Patel and Bongino held the weapon? What’s important is whether Crook’s DNA and fingerprints are on the weapon, and did the recovered projectiles match that weapon? Bongino was even more insulting when he explained to Bartiromo that “I’m not going to tell people what they want to hear. I’m going to tell people the truth.” Bongino said that there is no ‘there’ there. “If it was there,” said Bongino, “we would have told you.” Well, meh…apparently not. With all due respect to Bongino and Patel, the FBI has failed to provide any update since August of 2024…a month after the shooting.” The FBI has the physical evidence and, yet, more than a year after the assassination attempt, the public still has not been provided the physical evidence that proves whether Crooks was or wasn’t the shooter. But the FBI isn’t alone in its refusal to release investigative information about the assassination attempt. The Pennsylvania State Police refuse to release its report on the shooting incident, the Butler Coroner has not released his death investigation notes, the House Task Force has not released any of the physical evidence mentioned in its report so what’s the big secret? Let’s see what Tucker can provide us because the FBI/DOJ/Secret Service/etc are failing us in this regard.

How was Thomas Matthew Crooks identified, either by the Butler County Coroner or the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME)? The fact is the document that has been made public by the Butler Coroner, William F. Young III, is incorrect. Contrary to July 13th being the day the Butler County coroner viewed the body of the alleged shooter; Coroner Young did not view the body of the alleged shooter that lay on the AGR Building until 6a.m on July 14th. Further, the Allegheny County Medical Examiner also does not provide the investigative method used to identify the body of the alleged shooter, Crooks. Why? Why does neither of the men who handled the alleged shooter’s body, provide documentation as to its the identity, you know, maybe DNA? It seems odd, especially in light of the fact that the alleged shooter’s body lay on the AGR building roof all night with no mention as to what investigative entity had evidentiary control over the body. Eric may want to know if the Butler County Coroner wrote investigative notes about the crime scene, position of body, was alleged weapon still on the roof, what documentation was found on the deceased and were photographs taken before transport to Allegheny County? The President and his son may want to know about the ballistics associated with the alleged attempted assassination. For example, the House Task Force on the Attempted Assassination of Donald J. Trump, reports that the Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Pittsburgh Field Office stated, “all reviewable evidence collected from the AGR roof and from the subject’s body are consistent with the round fired by the Secret Service sniper.” First, what was the evidence collected from the AGR roof, and the round fired and collected from the alleged shooter’s body is only “consistent” with the round fired by the sniper? The round fired by the sniper either matches the sniper’s weapon or it doesn’t. Of course, the ballistics report that the FBI surely has completed would provide detailed information about the recovered projectiles. And this says nothing about the need for evidence about projectiles recovered that allegedly were fired at Trump and recovered from the late Corey Comperatore. Do those recovered projectiles match Crooks’ alleged weapon or are they just “consistent” with that type of projectile fired from the alleged weapon? So far, there is no physical evidence that has been made public that reveals how Crooks was identified as the alleged shooter nor any evidence that proves that Crooks held or fired the alleged weapon. And there is no physical evidence publicly available that proves that the projectiles that allegedly hit the President and others in the crowd match Crooks alleged weapon. The FBI ballistics report, if ever released, should answer all of the ballistics questions and, perhaps, provide conclusive detail about the identification of the alleged shooter. Other physical evidence that may be of interest to the President’s son deals with the tests conducted by the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME). Based on the information provided by the ME, it appears he failed to test the alleged shooter’s body for prescription psychiatric drugs. Studies show that blood tests are not sufficient to detect all psychiatric drugs and the ME does not provide detailed information about what prescription drug tests were conducted if any. Why? Was the alleged shooter taking psychiatric drugs? That information may never be known as Crooks body was cremated within days of the shooting. Moving along, Eric Trump may also want to know how Crooks’ parents, behavioral health experts, failed to realize their son was building bombs in his basement bedroom. It has been reported that Crooks’ father told investigators that within a year of the shooting, he had observed his son “dancing in his bedroom throughout the night.” Did Crooks’ dad ask why he was dancing in his bedroom throughout the night? Who knows. But it seems odd that behavioral health experts failed to notice that bomb making items were being delivered to their home and their son was making bombs in his bedroom, acting strangely and never thought to question this behavior. The FBI investigation would surely provide detailed information about the parent’s possible role in the assassination attempt. Afterall, it was Crooks’ father that provided the weapon allegedly used in the shooting. One would feel confident that the FBI had lots of questions for these seemingly out of touch mental health experts. Let’s be honest, one would assume the President need only ask his FBI Director, Kash Patel or maybe Dan Bongino, for a copy of the investigation. According to an interview that Patel and Bongino gave to Fox News host Maria Bartiromo last May, there are two reasons the investigation cannot be released. First says Patel, “two open, on going prosecutions… we can’t get ahead of the federal court case.” It would have been extremely informative, but Bartiromo did not bother to ask what the two federal cases were. Nevertheless, Patel assured Bartiromo that “we have both seen the firearm and physically held it.” What does that mean? Who cares if Patel and Bongino held the weapon? What’s important is whether Crook’s DNA and fingerprints are on the weapon, and did the recovered projectiles match that weapon? Bongino was even more insulting when he explained to Bartiromo that “I’m not going to tell people what they want to hear. I’m going to tell people the truth.” Bongino said that there is no ‘there’ there. “If it was there,” said Bongino, “we would have told you.” Well, meh…apparently not. With all due respect to Bongino and Patel, the FBI has failed to provide any update since August of 2024…a month after the shooting.” The FBI has the physical evidence and, yet, more than a year after the assassination attempt, the public still has not been provided the physical evidence that proves whether Crooks was or wasn’t the shooter. But the FBI isn’t alone in its refusal to release investigative information about the assassination attempt. The Pennsylvania State Police refuse to release its report on the shooting incident, the Butler Coroner has not released his death investigation notes, the House Task Force has not released any of the physical evidence mentioned in its report so what’s the big secret? Let’s see what Tucker can provide us because the FBI/DOJ/Secret Service/etc are failing us in this regard.

The President and his son may want to know about the ballistics associated with the alleged attempted assassination. For example, the House Task Force on the Attempted Assassination of Donald J. Trump, reports that the Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Pittsburgh Field Office stated, “all reviewable evidence collected from the AGR roof and from the subject’s body are consistent with the round fired by the Secret Service sniper.” First, what was the evidence collected from the AGR roof, and the round fired and collected from the alleged shooter’s body is only “consistent” with the round fired by the sniper? The round fired by the sniper either matches the sniper’s weapon or it doesn’t. Of course, the ballistics report that the FBI surely has completed would provide detailed information about the recovered projectiles. And this says nothing about the need for evidence about projectiles recovered that allegedly were fired at Trump and recovered from the late Corey Comperatore. Do those recovered projectiles match Crooks’ alleged weapon or are they just “consistent” with that type of projectile fired from the alleged weapon? So far, there is no physical evidence that has been made public that reveals how Crooks was identified as the alleged shooter nor any evidence that proves that Crooks held or fired the alleged weapon. And there is no physical evidence publicly available that proves that the projectiles that allegedly hit the President and others in the crowd match Crooks alleged weapon. The FBI ballistics report, if ever released, should answer all of the ballistics questions and, perhaps, provide conclusive detail about the identification of the alleged shooter. Other physical evidence that may be of interest to the President’s son deals with the tests conducted by the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME). Based on the information provided by the ME, it appears he failed to test the alleged shooter’s body for prescription psychiatric drugs. Studies show that blood tests are not sufficient to detect all psychiatric drugs and the ME does not provide detailed information about what prescription drug tests were conducted if any. Why? Was the alleged shooter taking psychiatric drugs? That information may never be known as Crooks body was cremated within days of the shooting. Moving along, Eric Trump may also want to know how Crooks’ parents, behavioral health experts, failed to realize their son was building bombs in his basement bedroom. It has been reported that Crooks’ father told investigators that within a year of the shooting, he had observed his son “dancing in his bedroom throughout the night.” Did Crooks’ dad ask why he was dancing in his bedroom throughout the night? Who knows. But it seems odd that behavioral health experts failed to notice that bomb making items were being delivered to their home and their son was making bombs in his bedroom, acting strangely and never thought to question this behavior. The FBI investigation would surely provide detailed information about the parent’s possible role in the assassination attempt. Afterall, it was Crooks’ father that provided the weapon allegedly used in the shooting. One would feel confident that the FBI had lots of questions for these seemingly out of touch mental health experts. Let’s be honest, one would assume the President need only ask his FBI Director, Kash Patel or maybe Dan Bongino, for a copy of the investigation. According to an interview that Patel and Bongino gave to Fox News host Maria Bartiromo last May, there are two reasons the investigation cannot be released. First says Patel, “two open, on going prosecutions… we can’t get ahead of the federal court case.” It would have been extremely informative, but Bartiromo did not bother to ask what the two federal cases were. Nevertheless, Patel assured Bartiromo that “we have both seen the firearm and physically held it.” What does that mean? Who cares if Patel and Bongino held the weapon? What’s important is whether Crook’s DNA and fingerprints are on the weapon, and did the recovered projectiles match that weapon? Bongino was even more insulting when he explained to Bartiromo that “I’m not going to tell people what they want to hear. I’m going to tell people the truth.” Bongino said that there is no ‘there’ there. “If it was there,” said Bongino, “we would have told you.” Well, meh…apparently not. With all due respect to Bongino and Patel, the FBI has failed to provide any update since August of 2024…a month after the shooting.” The FBI has the physical evidence and, yet, more than a year after the assassination attempt, the public still has not been provided the physical evidence that proves whether Crooks was or wasn’t the shooter. But the FBI isn’t alone in its refusal to release investigative information about the assassination attempt. The Pennsylvania State Police refuse to release its report on the shooting incident, the Butler Coroner has not released his death investigation notes, the House Task Force has not released any of the physical evidence mentioned in its report so what’s the big secret? Let’s see what Tucker can provide us because the FBI/DOJ/Secret Service/etc are failing us in this regard.

Studies show that blood tests are not sufficient to detect all psychiatric drugs and the ME does not provide detailed information about what prescription drug tests were conducted if any. Why? Was the alleged shooter taking psychiatric drugs? That information may never be known as Crooks body was cremated within days of the shooting. Moving along, Eric Trump may also want to know how Crooks’ parents, behavioral health experts, failed to realize their son was building bombs in his basement bedroom. It has been reported that Crooks’ father told investigators that within a year of the shooting, he had observed his son “dancing in his bedroom throughout the night.” Did Crooks’ dad ask why he was dancing in his bedroom throughout the night? Who knows. But it seems odd that behavioral health experts failed to notice that bomb making items were being delivered to their home and their son was making bombs in his bedroom, acting strangely and never thought to question this behavior. The FBI investigation would surely provide detailed information about the parent’s possible role in the assassination attempt. Afterall, it was Crooks’ father that provided the weapon allegedly used in the shooting. One would feel confident that the FBI had lots of questions for these seemingly out of touch mental health experts. Let’s be honest, one would assume the President need only ask his FBI Director, Kash Patel or maybe Dan Bongino, for a copy of the investigation. According to an interview that Patel and Bongino gave to Fox News host Maria Bartiromo last May, there are two reasons the investigation cannot be released. First says Patel, “two open, on going prosecutions… we can’t get ahead of the federal court case.” It would have been extremely informative, but Bartiromo did not bother to ask what the two federal cases were. Nevertheless, Patel assured Bartiromo that “we have both seen the firearm and physically held it.” What does that mean? Who cares if Patel and Bongino held the weapon? What’s important is whether Crook’s DNA and fingerprints are on the weapon, and did the recovered projectiles match that weapon? Bongino was even more insulting when he explained to Bartiromo that “I’m not going to tell people what they want to hear. I’m going to tell people the truth.” Bongino said that there is no ‘there’ there. “If it was there,” said Bongino, “we would have told you.” Well, meh…apparently not. With all due respect to Bongino and Patel, the FBI has failed to provide any update since August of 2024…a month after the shooting.” The FBI has the physical evidence and, yet, more than a year after the assassination attempt, the public still has not been provided the physical evidence that proves whether Crooks was or wasn’t the shooter. But the FBI isn’t alone in its refusal to release investigative information about the assassination attempt. The Pennsylvania State Police refuse to release its report on the shooting incident, the Butler Coroner has not released his death investigation notes, the House Task Force has not released any of the physical evidence mentioned in its report so what’s the big secret? Let’s see what Tucker can provide us because the FBI/DOJ/Secret Service/etc are failing us in this regard.

And certainly not for a rally that’s in the middle of nowhere in Pennsylvania – They wouldn’t let people be on that roof because the Secret service lady said it was sloped and it was dangerous – The snipers that were on the other roof was a, a steeper pitch (It made no f*cking sense) – Random people saw him and pointed him out on the roof with a gun for a long time before it happened – The kid had 5 phones – His body was immediately cremated – There was some indications that there was a phone that had been traveling from outside the FBI offices in D.C to where this kid lived multiple times We need answers. We provided a report from AbleChild last week that included a list of outstanding items related to Butler. There’s lots to be concerned about beginning with the identification of the alleged shooter. How was Thomas Matthew Crooks identified, either by the Butler County Coroner or the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME)? The fact is the document that has been made public by the Butler Coroner, William F. Young III, is incorrect. Contrary to July 13th being the day the Butler County coroner viewed the body of the alleged shooter; Coroner Young did not view the body of the alleged shooter that lay on the AGR Building until 6a.m on July 14th. Further, the Allegheny County Medical Examiner also does not provide the investigative method used to identify the body of the alleged shooter, Crooks. Why? Why does neither of the men who handled the alleged shooter’s body, provide documentation as to its the identity, you know, maybe DNA? It seems odd, especially in light of the fact that the alleged shooter’s body lay on the AGR building roof all night with no mention as to what investigative entity had evidentiary control over the body. Eric may want to know if the Butler County Coroner wrote investigative notes about the crime scene, position of body, was alleged weapon still on the roof, what documentation was found on the deceased and were photographs taken before transport to Allegheny County? The President and his son may want to know about the ballistics associated with the alleged attempted assassination. For example, the House Task Force on the Attempted Assassination of Donald J. Trump, reports that the Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Pittsburgh Field Office stated, “all reviewable evidence collected from the AGR roof and from the subject’s body are consistent with the round fired by the Secret Service sniper.” First, what was the evidence collected from the AGR roof, and the round fired and collected from the alleged shooter’s body is only “consistent” with the round fired by the sniper? The round fired by the sniper either matches the sniper’s weapon or it doesn’t. Of course, the ballistics report that the FBI surely has completed would provide detailed information about the recovered projectiles. And this says nothing about the need for evidence about projectiles recovered that allegedly were fired at Trump and recovered from the late Corey Comperatore. Do those recovered projectiles match Crooks’ alleged weapon or are they just “consistent” with that type of projectile fired from the alleged weapon? So far, there is no physical evidence that has been made public that reveals how Crooks was identified as the alleged shooter nor any evidence that proves that Crooks held or fired the alleged weapon. And there is no physical evidence publicly available that proves that the projectiles that allegedly hit the President and others in the crowd match Crooks alleged weapon. The FBI ballistics report, if ever released, should answer all of the ballistics questions and, perhaps, provide conclusive detail about the identification of the alleged shooter. Other physical evidence that may be of interest to the President’s son deals with the tests conducted by the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME). Based on the information provided by the ME, it appears he failed to test the alleged shooter’s body for prescription psychiatric drugs.

With all due respect to Bongino and Patel, the FBI has failed to provide any update since August of 2024…a month after the shooting.” The FBI has the physical evidence and, yet, more than a year after the assassination attempt, the public still has not been provided the physical evidence that proves whether Crooks was or wasn’t the shooter. But the FBI isn’t alone in its refusal to release investigative information about the assassination attempt. The Pennsylvania State Police refuse to release its report on the shooting incident, the Butler Coroner has not released his death investigation notes, the House Task Force has not released any of the physical evidence mentioned in its report so what’s the big secret? Let’s see what Tucker can provide us because the FBI/DOJ/Secret Service/etc are failing us in this regard.

We provided a report from AbleChild last week that included a list of outstanding items related to Butler. There’s lots to be concerned about beginning with the identification of the alleged shooter. How was Thomas Matthew Crooks identified, either by the Butler County Coroner or the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME)? The fact is the document that has been made public by the Butler Coroner, William F. Young III, is incorrect. Contrary to July 13th being the day the Butler County coroner viewed the body of the alleged shooter; Coroner Young did not view the body of the alleged shooter that lay on the AGR Building until 6a.m on July 14th. Further, the Allegheny County Medical Examiner also does not provide the investigative method used to identify the body of the alleged shooter, Crooks. Why? Why does neither of the men who handled the alleged shooter’s body, provide documentation as to its the identity, you know, maybe DNA? It seems odd, especially in light of the fact that the alleged shooter’s body lay on the AGR building roof all night with no mention as to what investigative entity had evidentiary control over the body. Eric may want to know if the Butler County Coroner wrote investigative notes about the crime scene, position of body, was alleged weapon still on the roof, what documentation was found on the deceased and were photographs taken before transport to Allegheny County? The President and his son may want to know about the ballistics associated with the alleged attempted assassination. For example, the House Task Force on the Attempted Assassination of Donald J. Trump, reports that the Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Pittsburgh Field Office stated, “all reviewable evidence collected from the AGR roof and from the subject’s body are consistent with the round fired by the Secret Service sniper.” First, what was the evidence collected from the AGR roof, and the round fired and collected from the alleged shooter’s body is only “consistent” with the round fired by the sniper? The round fired by the sniper either matches the sniper’s weapon or it doesn’t. Of course, the ballistics report that the FBI surely has completed would provide detailed information about the recovered projectiles. And this says nothing about the need for evidence about projectiles recovered that allegedly were fired at Trump and recovered from the late Corey Comperatore. Do those recovered projectiles match Crooks’ alleged weapon or are they just “consistent” with that type of projectile fired from the alleged weapon? So far, there is no physical evidence that has been made public that reveals how Crooks was identified as the alleged shooter nor any evidence that proves that Crooks held or fired the alleged weapon. And there is no physical evidence publicly available that proves that the projectiles that allegedly hit the President and others in the crowd match Crooks alleged weapon. The FBI ballistics report, if ever released, should answer all of the ballistics questions and, perhaps, provide conclusive detail about the identification of the alleged shooter. Other physical evidence that may be of interest to the President’s son deals with the tests conducted by the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME). Based on the information provided by the ME, it appears he failed to test the alleged shooter’s body for prescription psychiatric drugs. Studies show that blood tests are not sufficient to detect all psychiatric drugs and the ME does not provide detailed information about what prescription drug tests were conducted if any. Why? Was the alleged shooter taking psychiatric drugs? That information may never be known as Crooks body was cremated within days of the shooting. Moving along, Eric Trump may also want to know how Crooks’ parents, behavioral health experts, failed to realize their son was building bombs in his basement bedroom. It has been reported that Crooks’ father told investigators that within a year of the shooting, he had observed his son “dancing in his bedroom throughout the night.” Did Crooks’ dad ask why he was dancing in his bedroom throughout the night? Who knows. But it seems odd that behavioral health experts failed to notice that bomb making items were being delivered to their home and their son was making bombs in his bedroom, acting strangely and never thought to question this behavior. The FBI investigation would surely provide detailed information about the parent’s possible role in the assassination attempt. Afterall, it was Crooks’ father that provided the weapon allegedly used in the shooting. One would feel confident that the FBI had lots of questions for these seemingly out of touch mental health experts. Let’s be honest, one would assume the President need only ask his FBI Director, Kash Patel or maybe Dan Bongino, for a copy of the investigation. According to an interview that Patel and Bongino gave to Fox News host Maria Bartiromo last May, there are two reasons the investigation cannot be released. First says Patel, “two open, on going prosecutions… we can’t get ahead of the federal court case.” It would have been extremely informative, but Bartiromo did not bother to ask what the two federal cases were. Nevertheless, Patel assured Bartiromo that “we have both seen the firearm and physically held it.” What does that mean? Who cares if Patel and Bongino held the weapon? What’s important is whether Crook’s DNA and fingerprints are on the weapon, and did the recovered projectiles match that weapon? Bongino was even more insulting when he explained to Bartiromo that “I’m not going to tell people what they want to hear. I’m going to tell people the truth.” Bongino said that there is no ‘there’ there. “If it was there,” said Bongino, “we would have told you.” Well, meh…apparently not.

We provided a report from AbleChild last week that included a list of outstanding items related to Butler. There’s lots to be concerned about beginning with the identification of the alleged shooter. How was Thomas Matthew Crooks identified, either by the Butler County Coroner or the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME)? The fact is the document that has been made public by the Butler Coroner, William F. Young III, is incorrect. Contrary to July 13th being the day the Butler County coroner viewed the body of the alleged shooter; Coroner Young did not view the body of the alleged shooter that lay on the AGR Building until 6a.m on July 14th. Further, the Allegheny County Medical Examiner also does not provide the investigative method used to identify the body of the alleged shooter, Crooks. Why? Why does neither of the men who handled the alleged shooter’s body, provide documentation as to its the identity, you know, maybe DNA? It seems odd, especially in light of the fact that the alleged shooter’s body lay on the AGR building roof all night with no mention as to what investigative entity had evidentiary control over the body. Eric may want to know if the Butler County Coroner wrote investigative notes about the crime scene, position of body, was alleged weapon still on the roof, what documentation was found on the deceased and were photographs taken before transport to Allegheny County? The President and his son may want to know about the ballistics associated with the alleged attempted assassination. For example, the House Task Force on the Attempted Assassination of Donald J. Trump, reports that the Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Pittsburgh Field Office stated, “all reviewable evidence collected from the AGR roof and from the subject’s body are consistent with the round fired by the Secret Service sniper.” First, what was the evidence collected from the AGR roof, and the round fired and collected from the alleged shooter’s body is only “consistent” with the round fired by the sniper? The round fired by the sniper either matches the sniper’s weapon or it doesn’t. Of course, the ballistics report that the FBI surely has completed would provide detailed information about the recovered projectiles. And this says nothing about the need for evidence about projectiles recovered that allegedly were fired at Trump and recovered from the late Corey Comperatore. Do those recovered projectiles match Crooks’ alleged weapon or are they just “consistent” with that type of projectile fired from the alleged weapon? So far, there is no physical evidence that has been made public that reveals how Crooks was identified as the alleged shooter nor any evidence that proves that Crooks held or fired the alleged weapon. And there is no physical evidence publicly available that proves that the projectiles that allegedly hit the President and others in the crowd match Crooks alleged weapon. The FBI ballistics report, if ever released, should answer all of the ballistics questions and, perhaps, provide conclusive detail about the identification of the alleged shooter. Other physical evidence that may be of interest to the President’s son deals with the tests conducted by the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME). Based on the information provided by the ME, it appears he failed to test the alleged shooter’s body for prescription psychiatric drugs. Studies show that blood tests are not sufficient to detect all psychiatric drugs and the ME does not provide detailed information about what prescription drug tests were conducted if any. Why? Was the alleged shooter taking psychiatric drugs? That information may never be known as Crooks body was cremated within days of the shooting. Moving along, Eric Trump may also want to know how Crooks’ parents, behavioral health experts, failed to realize their son was building bombs in his basement bedroom. It has been reported that Crooks’ father told investigators that within a year of the shooting, he had observed his son “dancing in his bedroom throughout the night.” Did Crooks’ dad ask why he was dancing in his bedroom throughout the night? Who knows. But it seems odd that behavioral health experts failed to notice that bomb making items were being delivered to their home and their son was making bombs in his bedroom, acting strangely and never thought to question this behavior. The FBI investigation would surely provide detailed information about the parent’s possible role in the assassination attempt. Afterall, it was Crooks’ father that provided the weapon allegedly used in the shooting. One would feel confident that the FBI had lots of questions for these seemingly out of touch mental health experts. Let’s be honest, one would assume the President need only ask his FBI Director, Kash Patel or maybe Dan Bongino, for a copy of the investigation. According to an interview that Patel and Bongino gave to Fox News host Maria Bartiromo last May, there are two reasons the investigation cannot be released. First says Patel, “two open, on going prosecutions… we can’t get ahead of the federal court case.” It would have been extremely informative, but Bartiromo did not bother to ask what the two federal cases were. Nevertheless, Patel assured Bartiromo that “we have both seen the firearm and physically held it.” What does that mean? Who cares if Patel and Bongino held the weapon? What’s important is whether Crook’s DNA and fingerprints are on the weapon, and did the recovered projectiles match that weapon? Bongino was even more insulting when he explained to Bartiromo that “I’m not going to tell people what they want to hear. I’m going to tell people the truth.” Bongino said that there is no ‘there’ there. “If it was there,” said Bongino, “we would have told you.” Well, meh…apparently not. With all due respect to Bongino and Patel, the FBI has failed to provide any update since August of 2024…a month after the shooting.” The FBI has the physical evidence and, yet, more than a year after the assassination attempt, the public still has not been provided the physical evidence that proves whether Crooks was or wasn’t the shooter. But the FBI isn’t alone in its refusal to release investigative information about the assassination attempt. The Pennsylvania State Police refuse to release its report on the shooting incident, the Butler Coroner has not released his death investigation notes, the House Task Force has not released any of the physical evidence mentioned in its report so what’s the big secret? Let’s see what Tucker can provide us because the FBI/DOJ/Secret Service/etc are failing us in this regard.

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson – There was some indications that there was a phone that had been traveling from outside the FBI offices in D.C to where this kid lived multiple times We need answers. We provided a report from AbleChild last week that included a list of outstanding items related to Butler. There’s lots to be concerned about beginning with the identification of the alleged shooter. How was Thomas Matthew Crooks identified, either by the Butler County Coroner or the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME)? The fact is the document that has been made public by the Butler Coroner, William F. Young III, is incorrect. Contrary to July 13th being the day the Butler County coroner viewed the body of the alleged shooter; Coroner Young did not view the body of the alleged shooter that lay on the AGR Building until 6a.m on July 14th. Further, the Allegheny County Medical Examiner also does not provide the investigative method used to identify the body of the alleged shooter, Crooks. Why? Why does neither of the men who handled the alleged shooter’s body, provide documentation as to its the identity, you know, maybe DNA? It seems odd, especially in light of the fact that the alleged shooter’s body lay on the AGR building roof all night with no mention as to what investigative entity had evidentiary control over the body. Eric may want to know if the Butler County Coroner wrote investigative notes about the crime scene, position of body, was alleged weapon still on the roof, what documentation was found on the deceased and were photographs taken before transport to Allegheny County? The President and his son may want to know about the ballistics associated with the alleged attempted assassination. For example, the House Task Force on the Attempted Assassination of Donald J. Trump, reports that the Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Pittsburgh Field Office stated, “all reviewable evidence collected from the AGR roof and from the subject’s body are consistent with the round fired by the Secret Service sniper.” First, what was the evidence collected from the AGR roof, and the round fired and collected from the alleged shooter’s body is only “consistent” with the round fired by the sniper? The round fired by the sniper either matches the sniper’s weapon or it doesn’t. Of course, the ballistics report that the FBI surely has completed would provide detailed information about the recovered projectiles. And this says nothing about the need for evidence about projectiles recovered that allegedly were fired at Trump and recovered from the late Corey Comperatore. Do those recovered projectiles match Crooks’ alleged weapon or are they just “consistent” with that type of projectile fired from the alleged weapon? So far, there is no physical evidence that has been made public that reveals how Crooks was identified as the alleged shooter nor any evidence that proves that Crooks held or fired the alleged weapon. And there is no physical evidence publicly available that proves that the projectiles that allegedly hit the President and others in the crowd match Crooks alleged weapon. The FBI ballistics report, if ever released, should answer all of the ballistics questions and, perhaps, provide conclusive detail about the identification of the alleged shooter. Other physical evidence that may be of interest to the President’s son deals with the tests conducted by the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME). Based on the information provided by the ME, it appears he failed to test the alleged shooter’s body for prescription psychiatric drugs. Studies show that blood tests are not sufficient to detect all psychiatric drugs and the ME does not provide detailed information about what prescription drug tests were conducted if any. Why? Was the alleged shooter taking psychiatric drugs? That information may never be known as Crooks body was cremated within days of the shooting. Moving along, Eric Trump may also want to know how Crooks’ parents, behavioral health experts, failed to realize their son was building bombs in his basement bedroom. It has been reported that Crooks’ father told investigators that within a year of the shooting, he had observed his son “dancing in his bedroom throughout the night.” Did Crooks’ dad ask why he was dancing in his bedroom throughout the night? Who knows. But it seems odd that behavioral health experts failed to notice that bomb making items were being delivered to their home and their son was making bombs in his bedroom, acting strangely and never thought to question this behavior. The FBI investigation would surely provide detailed information about the parent’s possible role in the assassination attempt. Afterall, it was Crooks’ father that provided the weapon allegedly used in the shooting. One would feel confident that the FBI had lots of questions for these seemingly out of touch mental health experts. Let’s be honest, one would assume the President need only ask his FBI Director, Kash Patel or maybe Dan Bongino, for a copy of the investigation. According to an interview that Patel and Bongino gave to Fox News host Maria Bartiromo last May, there are two reasons the investigation cannot be released. First says Patel, “two open, on going prosecutions… we can’t get ahead of the federal court case.” It would have been extremely informative, but Bartiromo did not bother to ask what the two federal cases were. Nevertheless, Patel assured Bartiromo that “we have both seen the firearm and physically held it.” What does that mean? Who cares if Patel and Bongino held the weapon? What’s important is whether Crook’s DNA and fingerprints are on the weapon, and did the recovered projectiles match that weapon? Bongino was even more insulting when he explained to Bartiromo that “I’m not going to tell people what they want to hear. I’m going to tell people the truth.” Bongino said that there is no ‘there’ there. “If it was there,” said Bongino, “we would have told you.” Well, meh…apparently not. With all due respect to Bongino and Patel, the FBI has failed to provide any update since August of 2024…a month after the shooting.” The FBI has the physical evidence and, yet, more than a year after the assassination attempt, the public still has not been provided the physical evidence that proves whether Crooks was or wasn’t the shooter. But the FBI isn’t alone in its refusal to release investigative information about the assassination attempt. The Pennsylvania State Police refuse to release its report on the shooting incident, the Butler Coroner has not released his death investigation notes, the House Task Force has not released any of the physical evidence mentioned in its report so what’s the big secret? Let’s see what Tucker can provide us because the FBI/DOJ/Secret Service/etc are failing us in this regard.

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson We provided a report from AbleChild last week that included a list of outstanding items related to Butler. There’s lots to be concerned about beginning with the identification of the alleged shooter. How was Thomas Matthew Crooks identified, either by the Butler County Coroner or the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME)? The fact is the document that has been made public by the Butler Coroner, William F. Young III, is incorrect. Contrary to July 13th being the day the Butler County coroner viewed the body of the alleged shooter; Coroner Young did not view the body of the alleged shooter that lay on the AGR Building until 6a.m on July 14th. Further, the Allegheny County Medical Examiner also does not provide the investigative method used to identify the body of the alleged shooter, Crooks. Why? Why does neither of the men who handled the alleged shooter’s body, provide documentation as to its the identity, you know, maybe DNA? It seems odd, especially in light of the fact that the alleged shooter’s body lay on the AGR building roof all night with no mention as to what investigative entity had evidentiary control over the body. Eric may want to know if the Butler County Coroner wrote investigative notes about the crime scene, position of body, was alleged weapon still on the roof, what documentation was found on the deceased and were photographs taken before transport to Allegheny County? The President and his son may want to know about the ballistics associated with the alleged attempted assassination. For example, the House Task Force on the Attempted Assassination of Donald J. Trump, reports that the Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Pittsburgh Field Office stated, “all reviewable evidence collected from the AGR roof and from the subject’s body are consistent with the round fired by the Secret Service sniper.” First, what was the evidence collected from the AGR roof, and the round fired and collected from the alleged shooter’s body is only “consistent” with the round fired by the sniper? The round fired by the sniper either matches the sniper’s weapon or it doesn’t. Of course, the ballistics report that the FBI surely has completed would provide detailed information about the recovered projectiles. And this says nothing about the need for evidence about projectiles recovered that allegedly were fired at Trump and recovered from the late Corey Comperatore. Do those recovered projectiles match Crooks’ alleged weapon or are they just “consistent” with that type of projectile fired from the alleged weapon? So far, there is no physical evidence that has been made public that reveals how Crooks was identified as the alleged shooter nor any evidence that proves that Crooks held or fired the alleged weapon. And there is no physical evidence publicly available that proves that the projectiles that allegedly hit the President and others in the crowd match Crooks alleged weapon. The FBI ballistics report, if ever released, should answer all of the ballistics questions and, perhaps, provide conclusive detail about the identification of the alleged shooter. Other physical evidence that may be of interest to the President’s son deals with the tests conducted by the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME). Based on the information provided by the ME, it appears he failed to test the alleged shooter’s body for prescription psychiatric drugs. Studies show that blood tests are not sufficient to detect all psychiatric drugs and the ME does not provide detailed information about what prescription drug tests were conducted if any. Why? Was the alleged shooter taking psychiatric drugs? That information may never be known as Crooks body was cremated within days of the shooting. Moving along, Eric Trump may also want to know how Crooks’ parents, behavioral health experts, failed to realize their son was building bombs in his basement bedroom. It has been reported that Crooks’ father told investigators that within a year of the shooting, he had observed his son “dancing in his bedroom throughout the night.” Did Crooks’ dad ask why he was dancing in his bedroom throughout the night? Who knows. But it seems odd that behavioral health experts failed to notice that bomb making items were being delivered to their home and their son was making bombs in his bedroom, acting strangely and never thought to question this behavior. The FBI investigation would surely provide detailed information about the parent’s possible role in the assassination attempt. Afterall, it was Crooks’ father that provided the weapon allegedly used in the shooting. One would feel confident that the FBI had lots of questions for these seemingly out of touch mental health experts. Let’s be honest, one would assume the President need only ask his FBI Director, Kash Patel or maybe Dan Bongino, for a copy of the investigation. According to an interview that Patel and Bongino gave to Fox News host Maria Bartiromo last May, there are two reasons the investigation cannot be released. First says Patel, “two open, on going prosecutions… we can’t get ahead of the federal court case.” It would have been extremely informative, but Bartiromo did not bother to ask what the two federal cases were. Nevertheless, Patel assured Bartiromo that “we have both seen the firearm and physically held it.” What does that mean? Who cares if Patel and Bongino held the weapon? What’s important is whether Crook’s DNA and fingerprints are on the weapon, and did the recovered projectiles match that weapon? Bongino was even more insulting when he explained to Bartiromo that “I’m not going to tell people what they want to hear. I’m going to tell people the truth.” Bongino said that there is no ‘there’ there. “If it was there,” said Bongino, “we would have told you.” Well, meh…apparently not. With all due respect to Bongino and Patel, the FBI has failed to provide any update since August of 2024…a month after the shooting.” The FBI has the physical evidence and, yet, more than a year after the assassination attempt, the public still has not been provided the physical evidence that proves whether Crooks was or wasn’t the shooter. But the FBI isn’t alone in its refusal to release investigative information about the assassination attempt. The Pennsylvania State Police refuse to release its report on the shooting incident, the Butler Coroner has not released his death investigation notes, the House Task Force has not released any of the physical evidence mentioned in its report so what’s the big secret? Let’s see what Tucker can provide us because the FBI/DOJ/Secret Service/etc are failing us in this regard.

Trump, reports that the Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Pittsburgh Field Office stated, “all reviewable evidence collected from the AGR roof and from the subject’s body are consistent with the round fired by the Secret Service sniper.” First, what was the evidence collected from the AGR roof, and the round fired and collected from the alleged shooter’s body is only “consistent” with the round fired by the sniper? The round fired by the sniper either matches the sniper’s weapon or it doesn’t. Of course, the ballistics report that the FBI surely has completed would provide detailed information about the recovered projectiles. And this says nothing about the need for evidence about projectiles recovered that allegedly were fired at Trump and recovered from the late Corey Comperatore. Do those recovered projectiles match Crooks’ alleged weapon or are they just “consistent” with that type of projectile fired from the alleged weapon? So far, there is no physical evidence that has been made public that reveals how Crooks was identified as the alleged shooter nor any evidence that proves that Crooks held or fired the alleged weapon. And there is no physical evidence publicly available that proves that the projectiles that allegedly hit the President and others in the crowd match Crooks alleged weapon. The FBI ballistics report, if ever released, should answer all of the ballistics questions and, perhaps, provide conclusive detail about the identification of the alleged shooter. Other physical evidence that may be of interest to the President’s son deals with the tests conducted by the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME). Based on the information provided by the ME, it appears he failed to test the alleged shooter’s body for prescription psychiatric drugs. Studies show that blood tests are not sufficient to detect all psychiatric drugs and the ME does not provide detailed information about what prescription drug tests were conducted if any. Why? Was the alleged shooter taking psychiatric drugs? That information may never be known as Crooks body was cremated within days of the shooting. Moving along, Eric Trump may also want to know how Crooks’ parents, behavioral health experts, failed to realize their son was building bombs in his basement bedroom. It has been reported that Crooks’ father told investigators that within a year of the shooting, he had observed his son “dancing in his bedroom throughout the night.” Did Crooks’ dad ask why he was dancing in his bedroom throughout the night? Who knows. But it seems odd that behavioral health experts failed to notice that bomb making items were being delivered to their home and their son was making bombs in his bedroom, acting strangely and never thought to question this behavior. The FBI investigation would surely provide detailed information about the parent’s possible role in the assassination attempt. Afterall, it was Crooks’ father that provided the weapon allegedly used in the shooting. One would feel confident that the FBI had lots of questions for these seemingly out of touch mental health experts. Let’s be honest, one would assume the President need only ask his FBI Director, Kash Patel or maybe Dan Bongino, for a copy of the investigation. According to an interview that Patel and Bongino gave to Fox News host Maria Bartiromo last May, there are two reasons the investigation cannot be released. First says Patel, “two open, on going prosecutions… we can’t get ahead of the federal court case.” It would have been extremely informative, but Bartiromo did not bother to ask what the two federal cases were. Nevertheless, Patel assured Bartiromo that “we have both seen the firearm and physically held it.” What does that mean? Who cares if Patel and Bongino held the weapon? What’s important is whether Crook’s DNA and fingerprints are on the weapon, and did the recovered projectiles match that weapon? Bongino was even more insulting when he explained to Bartiromo that “I’m not going to tell people what they want to hear. I’m going to tell people the truth.” Bongino said that there is no ‘there’ there. “If it was there,” said Bongino, “we would have told you.” Well, meh…apparently not. With all due respect to Bongino and Patel, the FBI has failed to provide any update since August of 2024…a month after the shooting.” The FBI has the physical evidence and, yet, more than a year after the assassination attempt, the public still has not been provided the physical evidence that proves whether Crooks was or wasn’t the shooter. But the FBI isn’t alone in its refusal to release investigative information about the assassination attempt. The Pennsylvania State Police refuse to release its report on the shooting incident, the Butler Coroner has not released his death investigation notes, the House Task Force has not released any of the physical evidence mentioned in its report so what’s the big secret? Let’s see what Tucker can provide us because the FBI/DOJ/Secret Service/etc are failing us in this regard.

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson So far, there is no physical evidence that has been made public that reveals how Crooks was identified as the alleged shooter nor any evidence that proves that Crooks held or fired the alleged weapon. And there is no physical evidence publicly available that proves that the projectiles that allegedly hit the President and others in the crowd match Crooks alleged weapon. The FBI ballistics report, if ever released, should answer all of the ballistics questions and, perhaps, provide conclusive detail about the identification of the alleged shooter. Other physical evidence that may be of interest to the President’s son deals with the tests conducted by the Allegheny County Medical Examiner (ME). Based on the information provided by the ME, it appears he failed to test the alleged shooter’s body for prescription psychiatric drugs. Studies show that blood tests are not sufficient to detect all psychiatric drugs and the ME does not provide detailed information about what prescription drug tests were conducted if any. Why? Was the alleged shooter taking psychiatric drugs? That information may never be known as Crooks body was cremated within days of the shooting. Moving along, Eric Trump may also want to know how Crooks’ parents, behavioral health experts, failed to realize their son was building bombs in his basement bedroom. It has been reported that Crooks’ father told investigators that within a year of the shooting, he had observed his son “dancing in his bedroom throughout the night.” Did Crooks’ dad ask why he was dancing in his bedroom throughout the night? Who knows. But it seems odd that behavioral health experts failed to notice that bomb making items were being delivered to their home and their son was making bombs in his bedroom, acting strangely and never thought to question this behavior. The FBI investigation would surely provide detailed information about the parent’s possible role in the assassination attempt. Afterall, it was Crooks’ father that provided the weapon allegedly used in the shooting. One would feel confident that the FBI had lots of questions for these seemingly out of touch mental health experts. Let’s be honest, one would assume the President need only ask his FBI Director, Kash Patel or maybe Dan Bongino, for a copy of the investigation. According to an interview that Patel and Bongino gave to Fox News host Maria Bartiromo last May, there are two reasons the investigation cannot be released. First says Patel, “two open, on going prosecutions… we can’t get ahead of the federal court case.” It would have been extremely informative, but Bartiromo did not bother to ask what the two federal cases were. Nevertheless, Patel assured Bartiromo that “we have both seen the firearm and physically held it.” What does that mean? Who cares if Patel and Bongino held the weapon? What’s important is whether Crook’s DNA and fingerprints are on the weapon, and did the recovered projectiles match that weapon? Bongino was even more insulting when he explained to Bartiromo that “I’m not going to tell people what they want to hear. I’m going to tell people the truth.” Bongino said that there is no ‘there’ there. “If it was there,” said Bongino, “we would have told you.” Well, meh…apparently not. With all due respect to Bongino and Patel, the FBI has failed to provide any update since August of 2024…a month after the shooting.” The FBI has the physical evidence and, yet, more than a year after the assassination attempt, the public still has not been provided the physical evidence that proves whether Crooks was or wasn’t the shooter. But the FBI isn’t alone in its refusal to release investigative information about the assassination attempt. The Pennsylvania State Police refuse to release its report on the shooting incident, the Butler Coroner has not released his death investigation notes, the House Task Force has not released any of the physical evidence mentioned in its report so what’s the big secret? Let’s see what Tucker can provide us because the FBI/DOJ/Secret Service/etc are failing us in this regard.

It has been reported that Crooks’ father told investigators that within a year of the shooting, he had observed his son “dancing in his bedroom throughout the night.” Did Crooks’ dad ask why he was dancing in his bedroom throughout the night? Who knows. But it seems odd that behavioral health experts failed to notice that bomb making items were being delivered to their home and their son was making bombs in his bedroom, acting strangely and never thought to question this behavior. The FBI investigation would surely provide detailed information about the parent’s possible role in the assassination attempt. Afterall, it was Crooks’ father that provided the weapon allegedly used in the shooting. One would feel confident that the FBI had lots of questions for these seemingly out of touch mental health experts. Let’s be honest, one would assume the President need only ask his FBI Director, Kash Patel or maybe Dan Bongino, for a copy of the investigation. According to an interview that Patel and Bongino gave to Fox News host Maria Bartiromo last May, there are two reasons the investigation cannot be released. First says Patel, “two open, on going prosecutions… we can’t get ahead of the federal court case.” It would have been extremely informative, but Bartiromo did not bother to ask what the two federal cases were. Nevertheless, Patel assured Bartiromo that “we have both seen the firearm and physically held it.” What does that mean? Who cares if Patel and Bongino held the weapon? What’s important is whether Crook’s DNA and fingerprints are on the weapon, and did the recovered projectiles match that weapon? Bongino was even more insulting when he explained to Bartiromo that “I’m not going to tell people what they want to hear. I’m going to tell people the truth.” Bongino said that there is no ‘there’ there. “If it was there,” said Bongino, “we would have told you.” Well, meh…apparently not. With all due respect to Bongino and Patel, the FBI has failed to provide any update since August of 2024…a month after the shooting.” The FBI has the physical evidence and, yet, more than a year after the assassination attempt, the public still has not been provided the physical evidence that proves whether Crooks was or wasn’t the shooter. But the FBI isn’t alone in its refusal to release investigative information about the assassination attempt. The Pennsylvania State Police refuse to release its report on the shooting incident, the Butler Coroner has not released his death investigation notes, the House Task Force has not released any of the physical evidence mentioned in its report so what’s the big secret? Let’s see what Tucker can provide us because the FBI/DOJ/Secret Service/etc are failing us in this regard.

According to an interview that Patel and Bongino gave to Fox News host Maria Bartiromo last May, there are two reasons the investigation cannot be released. First says Patel, “two open, on going prosecutions… we can’t get ahead of the federal court case.” It would have been extremely informative, but Bartiromo did not bother to ask what the two federal cases were. Nevertheless, Patel assured Bartiromo that “we have both seen the firearm and physically held it.” What does that mean? Who cares if Patel and Bongino held the weapon? What’s important is whether Crook’s DNA and fingerprints are on the weapon, and did the recovered projectiles match that weapon? Bongino was even more insulting when he explained to Bartiromo that “I’m not going to tell people what they want to hear. I’m going to tell people the truth.” Bongino said that there is no ‘there’ there. “If it was there,” said Bongino, “we would have told you.” Well, meh…apparently not. With all due respect to Bongino and Patel, the FBI has failed to provide any update since August of 2024…a month after the shooting.” The FBI has the physical evidence and, yet, more than a year after the assassination attempt, the public still has not been provided the physical evidence that proves whether Crooks was or wasn’t the shooter. But the FBI isn’t alone in its refusal to release investigative information about the assassination attempt. The Pennsylvania State Police refuse to release its report on the shooting incident, the Butler Coroner has not released his death investigation notes, the House Task Force has not released any of the physical evidence mentioned in its report so what’s the big secret? Let’s see what Tucker can provide us because the FBI/DOJ/Secret Service/etc are failing us in this regard.

With all due respect to Bongino and Patel, the FBI has failed to provide any update since August of 2024…a month after the shooting.” The FBI has the physical evidence and, yet, more than a year after the assassination attempt, the public still has not been provided the physical evidence that proves whether Crooks was or wasn’t the shooter. But the FBI isn’t alone in its refusal to release investigative information about the assassination attempt. The Pennsylvania State Police refuse to release its report on the shooting incident, the Butler Coroner has not released his death investigation notes, the House Task Force has not released any of the physical evidence mentioned in its report so what’s the big secret?

Title: How the Grayscale IPO changes the cost to hold $35 billion crypto ETF shares
URL: https://cryptoslate.com/how-grayscale-going-public-changes-the-cost-to-hold-35-billion-etf-shares/

Full Content:
Grayscale reported $318.7 million in revenue for the nine months ended Sept. 30, down from $397.9 million in the same period of 2024. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Grayscale filed an S-1 form with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Nov. 13 to list Class A common stock on the New York Stock Exchange under ticker symbol GRAY. The firm manages approximately $35 billion across more than 40 crypto products, including spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. As a public company, Grayscale will have to disclose more financials and face shareholder pressure, which could influence future fee decisions and product strategy. The filing does not specify share count or pricing range for the proposed offering. Morgan Stanley, BofA Securities, Jefferies, and Cantor will serve as lead managing bookrunners. Grayscale reported $318.7 million in revenue for the nine months ended Sept. 30, down from $397.9 million in the same period of 2024. The company posted net income of $203.3 million through September 2025 compared with $223.7 million a year earlier. Operating margin reached 65.7% in the recent nine-month period. The firm’s weighted-average management fee declined to 1.39% through September 2025 from 1.67% in the prior-year period, reflecting competitive pressure from lower-cost ETF entrants, including BlackRock and Fidelity. Average assets under management slipped to $30.6 billion from $31.8 billion year-over-year. Full-year 2024 results showed revenue of $506.2 million and net income of $282.1 million, down from $512.7 million and $325 million, respectively, in 2023. The company attributed the decline to reduced management fees, outflows, and distributions. The offering employs a dual-class share structure, giving Digital Currency Group, Grayscale’s parent company, 10 votes per Class B share compared with one vote per Class A share. DCG will retain approximately 70% of total voting power after the IPO through its Class B holdings, which carry no economic rights. Each Class A share will receive one vote and full economic participation. The structure qualifies Grayscale as a “controlled company” under NYSE rules, exempting it from certain corporate governance requirements. The Class B super-voting rights terminate when DCG’s ownership falls below 20% of total shares outstanding. The IPO does not alter the legal structure, custody arrangements, or operations of Grayscale’s existing trusts and ETFs. Fund assets remain held by third-party custodians under separate trust agreements. The company completed a reorganization into a Delaware holding structure earlier in 2025, which it stated would not materially affect trust operations. Net proceeds from the offering will be used to purchase membership interests from existing owners in Grayscale Operating, rather than funding capital expenditures. The transaction converts private ownership stakes into publicly tradable equity without requiring the injection of new capital into fund operations or altering sponsor fee arrangements. Grayscale reserved a portion of IPO shares for eligible investors in its Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC) and Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHE) through a directed share program. Participants must have held GBTC or ETHE shares as of Oct. 28 and complete pre-registration by Nov. 24. The program does not guarantee allocations, and shares purchased through it face no lock-up restrictions. The public listing will subject Grayscale to quarterly and annual reporting requirements, providing ETF investors with increased visibility into the sponsor’s financial condition, litigation exposure, and product concentration. The registration statement indicates that future fee decisions and product expansion plans will face scrutiny from public equity holders alongside existing competitive pressure in the ETF market.

She has worked with the Los Angeles Times and Times Community News, Maria Shriver, Vertical Networks, attn:, Patch and City News Service. She is a Southern California native and Loyola University Chicago graduate. President Donald Trump asked top CEOs for their solutions on how to navigate affordability for Americans while apparently forecasting an economic boom in the U.S. that he compared to the Reagan and Clinton eras. The president held a private dinner at the White House on Wednesday with several top CEOs from Wall Street and corporate America, including JPMorgan Chase chief Jamie Dimon, Larry Fink of Blackrock, Ted Pick of Morgan Stanley, David Solomon of Goldman Sachs, Nasdaq’s Adena Friedman and Blackstone CEO Steve Schwarzman, according to The New York Post. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick were also there. “He spoke a lot about affordability and what we can do from a market perspective to address it,” one CEO told The Post. Although Trump did not refer to it as an "affordability crisis," he did notion to the CEOs that Americans are struggling and that he's looking for help to improve things. "The CEOs didn’t confront Trump on his prediction, which is far higher than most optimistic forecasts, including the 4% growth outlook from the Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank. But privately, many had doubts given the current economic headwinds," The Post reports. Some CEOs told the outlet that even Trump's own economic advisers are skeptical that this growth could happen, voicing their concerns over the 2026 midterm elections after the Democratic governor victories in New Jersey, Virginia and Zohran Mamdani's mayoral election in New York City. “I sure hope the president is right about 6% growth,” another CEO said in an interview with The Post. “But I don’t see how we get there. His people are worried as well particularly about affordability but they won’t tell him. He’s surrounded by a lot of ‘yes men.'” Some of the CEOs suggested opening up the markets for people to put their retirement savings in the stock market. Based on what's happened in the past, this could yield high returns for investors compared to other assets. “Trump is really interested in making sure we have an economy of owners, not renters with all their money in the bank,” another CEO who declined to be named told The Post.

Title: 'Irish rugby owes such admiration and respect to Joe'

Neil Treacy RTÉ Sport Journalist Even six years on from leaving, Joe Schmidt remains intrinsically linked with Irish rugby. It's not just in the professional game that the former Leinster and Ireland coach is keeping his ear to the ground. Like many visiting teams to Dublin, the Wallabies had booked Wanderers RFC on Merrion Road for their training base this week, but when a deluge of rain fell on the city on Wednesday night, a late call was made - at 10.47pm to be exact, according to Schmidt – to try find a new venue. A few calls were made, and the Wallabies were soon able to hold their Thursday morning training session at Blackrock College. "As a Terenure man, that was a really big favour," Schmidt joked. The New Zealander was in wonderful form on Thursday after naming his side for this evening’s Quilter Nations Series meeting with Ireland. Enthusiasm at a press conference can often be painted on, but there was no doubting Schmidt's sincerity as he spoke ahead of what could be his final time coaching a team at the Aviva Stadium. The one downside, he claimed, was that even the late kick-off at the Aviva wouldn't be late enough to allow him get down to Lakelands and watch his adopted club, Terenure, take on their Dublin 6 neighbours St Mary’s College in the All-Ireland League this afternoon. "I still think of the game a lot through Joe's eyes..." - Tadhg Furlong and James Ryan on Joe Schmidt's lasting legacy in Irish Rugby 🏉 Watch #IREvAUS live on @RTE2 and @RTEplayer this Saturday. ☘️🦘 pic.twitter.com/30mE6RcYB6 Nure got multiple mentions from Schmidt when he spoke to the media on Thursday. They were his local club when he lived in Dublin, while he was a patron for the Terenure Tigers, the club’s team for those with special needs. His son, Tim, played to AIL level with the club, and as coincidence would have it, they are now coached by another famous Kiwi, Carlos Spencer, who Schmidt coached during their time together at the Auckland Blues. With every year that he’s been out of Ireland, his relationship with the country appears to have grown stronger. In his nine years coaching Leinster and Ireland, silverware became the norm. In three seasons as Leinster head coach, he guided the province to two Champions Cup titles, one URC (then Pro12) and a Challenge Cup, before delivering three Six Nations titles, one of which was a Grand Slam, in six years coaching Ireland. That trophy haul made the breakup all the more painful, as Ireland limped out of the 2019 Rugby World Cup in Schmidt’s final season, an ending that threatened to damage his hard-earned legacy. But as usual, time has healed many of those wounds. "He's a hell of a coach," Tadhg Furlong told RTÉ Sport this week. "I think Irish rugby owes such admiration and respect to Joe and what he did, for not only the team when he was in charge, but some of the systems he put in place, working alongside David Nucifora obviously." Furlong is one of many in this Irish squad for whom Schmidt had a profound impact. Of the matchday squad for this Saturday, eight were given Ireland debuts by Schmidt during his time in charge, while four others in the wider squad came through under the New Zealander. His influence is arguably even stronger in the coaching team. Schmidt brought Andy Farrell in as his assistant in 2016 after he had been let go by England, and his career has gone from strength to strength. Paul O’Connell and Johnny Sexton were two of Schmidt’s key players during his time in charge of Ireland, while Simon Easterby was his long time forwards coach. John Fogarty and Andrew Goodman also both briefly played under him at Leinster. "I grew up in international rugby under Joe and I still think of the game a lot through Joe's eyes and some of the phrases and sayings, ingrained in us as a team, you're still kind of thinking that way," Furlong added. "Even though he's gone, and he's gone a long time, he still has a lasting effect on not only Irish rugby as a whole, but I think with certain players in the group that have been coached by him still." James Ryan is another of the current Irish frontliners who was given his start under Schmidt, making his Ireland debut against the USA in the summer of 2017 before he had even represented Leinster. "I hadn't played any rugby and I went on that Irish tour. It was my first taste of what it was like at the highest level," Ryan said. "I'd say at that age, I was 20, I just took a huge amount from him. You understand what a proper, committed preparation looks like. "I'm not saying anything that hasn't been said about him before, but the level of prep, the level of detail and understanding of what you need to get across to be ready for the weekend. It was huge and it's definitely something that I learned at that age." When he left the Ireland job in 2019, he initially said he would be retiring from coaching, and spent some time consulting with World Rugby, before he was tempted to help out with the All Blacks as a selector, and when a Covid-19 outbreak derailed the New Zealand squad during their Test series with Ireland in 2022, it was Schmidt who was brought in to lead the team on the week of the first Test. The All Blacks hammered Ireland in that first Test, although Farrell’s side would go on to win the series, before Schmidt got his revenge a year later when he was part of the New Zealand coaching team that once again knocked Ireland out of the World Cup. He got back into head coaching in 2024 when he took on the Wallabies job, a task described this week by the Sydney Morning Herald's Jonathan Drennan as a "bin-fire" after their disastrous World Cup showing the previous year. "Joe said he was going to take a step back from rugby when he left [Ireland] and I wish he did because you just keep coming up against Joe Schmidt," Furlong laughs, as he looked forward to meeting his old coach once again. This will be his second – and last – trip to Dublin as Australia head coach, and considering the green tint on this year’s British and Irish Lions, Schmidt should be plenty familiar with the strengths and weaknesses of this Irish side. "I think Joe understands the Irish system pretty well," Ryan says. "He understands us pretty well and I get the sense that he loves coming over here with Australia and trying to take us on. "We've had some big games against them over the years and I know that will be no different this weekend. Both of those went right down to the wire in the last couple of years."

Title: BlackRock’s BUILD launches on BNB Chain as RWA momentum accelerates

BNB Chain has welcomed a new resident today as BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUILD) went live on the platform. The strategic launch, powered by Securitize’s compliant tokenization platform and Wormhole, adds one of the most regulated digital assets to Binance’s thriving financial ecosystem. The strategic move comes as real-world assets see massive traction, with their value up 6% the past month to surpass $36 billion. BUILD’s debut reflects the convergence between blockchain and traditional finance. BlackRock is a leading asset manager and is now bringing its trust, base, and compliance to BNB Chain, a platform known for accessibility, low fees, and high speed. Commenting on today’s arrival, BNB Chain Head of Business Development Sarah Song said: BNB Chain is designed for scalable, low-cost, and secure financial applications, and we’re excited to welcome BUILD to our ecosystem. BUILD is turning real-world assets into programmable financial instruments, enabling entirely new types of investment strategies on-chain. Meanwhile, the development introduces a new share class on Binance’s ecosystem, offering eligible investors access to a tokenized US dollar yield in a blockchain setup. BlackRock’s tokenized asset also secures new utility. Binance will now accept BUILD as collateral. That allows professional traders and institutions to deploy cash smoothly without surrendering exposure to Treasuries-linked RWAs. That use case underscores the broader shift in how on-chain systems integrate real-world assets. These products are maturing from static representations to practical instruments that can function across DeFi and TradFi environments. Securitize, a regulated tokenization firm boasting more than $4 billion in tokenized AUM (assets under management), is powering BlackRock’s expansion into BNB Chain. Securitize handles everything from fund administration to digital transaction agency services. That ensures that clients access enterprise-level RWAs within regulated frameworks. At the same time, BUILD unlocks new use cases that were previously absent for real-world tokenized assets. According to Securitize CEO Carlos Domingo: Expanding BUILD to the BNB Chain and making it available as collateral on the Binance exchange further extends its accessibility and reinforces our mission to bring regulated real-world assets on-chain while unlocking new forms of utility that were previously out of reach. BUILD’s launch on BNB Chain comes as on-chain real-world assets see impressive growth. RWAxyz data shows the value of RWAs on public blockchains increased by 5.91% the past 30 days to $36.06 billion. Furthermore, the number of holders surged 10.78% to 537,549, with asset issuers hitting 249. Such figures reflect a flourishing ecosystem of enterprises tokenizing regulated real-world assets. Stablecoins also steadied despite crypto market turmoil, with their value up 0.79% in a month to $299.76 billion. Moreover, stablecoin holders increased by 3.39% in that timeframe to $202.89 million, indicating unwavering demand for digitized financial instruments that guarantee liquidity, compliance, and stability.

Title: THE MORNING RANT: Uninsured Motorists, Illegal Aliens, and the Soaring Cost of Auto Insurance
URL: https://acecomments.mu.nu/?post=417303

THE MORNING RANT: Uninsured Motorists, Illegal Aliens, and the Soaring Cost of Auto Insurance The cost of auto insurance, for those of us who actually keep our vehicles insured, has increased dramatically in the past few years. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (as reported by US News), the cost of car insurance increased by 56% from 2020 to 2025. There are obviously many inputs into the increased cost of insurance, including the obvious one - an increase in the cost of repairs, because vehicles are more expensive and more complicated than ever before. Most news stories will also lazily throw in tariffs or supply chain problems as contributing reasons. But there is another worsening problem that is a major cause of rising auto insurance premiums, and that is uninsured drivers. Coincidentally, the surge in uninsured drivers over recent years neatly coincides with President Biden and Alejandro Mayorkas throwing the border open wide to millions of illegal aliens. Per the Insurance Research Council’s most recent full year data (2023), there has been a huge increase in the number of uninsured drivers. In 2019, 11.6% of drivers lacked automobile liability insurance, but just four years later in 2023 that number had increased to 15.4% of drivers. Another way to state this is that in 2019, one in nine drivers were uninsured, but in 2023 that number had deteriorated to one in six. This data is sourced from insurance claims where an insured driver had to use his Uninsured Motorist Coverage to make a claim, because the party at fault in the wreck did not have insurance. But this also means that wrecks between two uninsured motorists go unnoticed by the Insurance Research Council (“IRC”, as do single car wrecks involving uninsured motorists, since they obviously cannot make an insurance claim. It can be extrapolated then that the percent of uninsured drivers is even higher. Compounding the problem is the growing number of drivers who are underinsured, meaning they have liability insurance at the minimum amount required to register a vehicle and/or obtain a drivers license, but the amount of insurance is woefully insufficient. For instance, Texas’ minimum requirement for liability insurance covers just $25,000 of physical damage per accident, which is less than the replacement cost of most cars on the road, and much less than the average cost of most new cars. In California, the amount is just $15,000. Per the IRC, in the same four-year span of 2019, the number of underinsured motorists increased from 12.2% of drivers to 18.0%. In summary, here is the expensive truth: • More than 33% of accidents involve drivers who are either uninsured or underinsured, meaning they do not have sufficient insurance to pay for the damage they caused. This is up from 23% in just four years. • Therefore, one in three wrecks require the party not at fault to file a claim against his own insurance company, using his “Uninsured Motorist Coverage.” • This also means that those of us obeying the law and properly maintaining our insurance are subsidizing uninsured and underinsured drivers. I have insinuated that the rise in uninsured motorists corresponds closely with the Biden-era influx of illegal aliens. While correlation alone does not prove causation, there is data indicating that the influx of non-citizen drivers has been a major contributor to the rise in uninsured motorists. In a post of mine from September titled “Tricolor Auto’s Failure Has It All - ESG, Woke Capital, Illegal Immigration, Securities Fraud, Government Diversity Programs, BlackRock, etc” I documented that Tricolor was a company that sold and financed used cars, and its primary market was Spanish-speaking illegal aliens. It was the 7th largest used car dealer in the country, with a huge market presence in California and Texas. Tricolor went spectacularly bankrupt when President Trump’s crackdown on illegal aliens brought sales to a standstill and widespread defaults on loan repayment. What I didn’t document was Tricolor’s role in putting drivers on the road who weren’t properly insured. The simple truth is that a critical aspect of selling used cars to high-risk drivers is that liability insurance must be obtained to get a vehicle registered, so there is an industry that provides 30-day liability insurance policies to these high-risk drivers. Once the vehicle is registered, it is extremely common for the insurance to lapse after 30 days. The actuarial risk these companies are taking is that the high-risk driver can make it one whole month without causing a wreck before the insurance lapses. Since Tricolor needed its customers insured, albeit briefly, it established its own insurance agency which worked exclusively with “nonstandard” insurance carriers to provide the 30-day policies necessary to sell a car. Per an article from 2019 in Auto Remarketing magazine, “Tricolor Insurance Agency, an affiliate of Tricolor Auto Group, currently serves as an agent for 10 nonstandard carriers and markets its services throughout Tricolor’s 28 dealerships and through its eight Ganas dealerships in southern California.” This article estimated that even in 2019, nonstandard insurance comprised about 30% of the personal auto insurance market. Because the insurance being sold by nonstandard insurers is the bare minimum required to get a vehicle registered, that also effectively means that every driver with nonstandard insurance is “underinsured” until their insurance lapses, at which time they are completely uninsured. This also means that pretty much every customer Tricolor sold a vehicle to did not have sufficient insurance coverage to pay for the wrecks they caused. And for every vehicle Tricolor sold, there were many other vehicles sold to the same customer base by other used car dealers. As bad as this all sounds, it gets even worse. Ace of Spades reader “Sabrecav” educated me on just how unsavory the nonstandard insurance racket is. Although their market is customers who are otherwise uninsurable, if a customer with a nonstandard insurance policy gets into a wreck before his policy lapses, the nonstandard insurers are very aggressive about refusing to pay claims. Sabrecav provided me a link to this story as an example: “Crash victims say 'non-standard' auto insurance companies are not fairly compensating them” [ABC7Chicago – 02/18/2025] Drivers must have insurance in Illinois, and non-standard insurance legally covers those who are a high risk or have a bad credit history. But some people who were hit by drivers with non-standard insurance say they are getting lowballed on claims. Debra Smith has been battling the Chicago-based driver's insurance company American Alliance Casualty. It is a non-standard auto insurer. She says the process was slow and she was offered much less than she thought she would get. "They're saying $1,000. That won't be - that's not even the amount of money to get to replace the stuff," Smith said. An estimate from her body shop said repairs could be $5,320. And American Alliance Casualty is saying that it will only cover $805 dollars of its own $1,000 estimate because its only accepting 75% of liability. The Biden-era open-border policy has been costly and destructive to this country in so many ways. One of those is the cost being borne by those of us who maintain auto insurance, because we are paying for the increase in wrecks caused by uninsured illegal aliens.

Supply chain is indeed a real problem and cause. Especially for newer foreign cars, getting replacement parts is hard if not impossible unless you pay inflated prices. Exotics? Fuhgeddaboudit. So the costs of repairs is much higher than they should be. In some cases, the cost would be so high that the insurance company just totals the car and sells off the good parts. Happened to me a few years ago. The car was repairable, but it would have cost so much that the carrier just cut me a big check.

Posted by: Zombie Robbo the Llama Butcher at November 14, 2025 11:13 AM (LxER7) 28 I would add there are many other factors influencing higher insurance costs: 1. Biden inflation. Everything costs more now. Insurance too. 2. Vast number of utterly terrible drivers on the road. Many are immigrants (legal and illegal) from scumbag cultures who drive like drunken retards. But an awful lot of Americans are terrible too, and some older people no longer have adequate faculties and shouldn't be driving. 3. Huge explosion of delivery drivers, delivery trucks, delivery carts, mopeds, e-bikes, etc. Especially in big cities, there are simply more things on the road to hit.

A beautiful fall day. Its 9am and I was driving safely. Car crosses center line and barrels toward me. Do something, anything, or it's high speed head on! I swerve left and cram the brakes as the car veers to my right. CRASH! Got hit on the right hand side of the front end. If there had been anyone in the front passenger seat, they most likely would have died. My injuries were mostly minor except for the crushed heel. Driver was Mexican, legal but stoned. His passengers were illegal, one dead at the scene and the other got a helicopter ride to Indianapolis. They dropped a LifeFlight chopper on the highway about 5 feet from the perimeter of a secure military base! They had to stop in Bloomington to stabilize the guy before going on to Indy. And as soon as he recovered from his amputation, he skedaddled back to Mexico. Driver was underinsured. Took forever to get any money from that shit. My health insurance and car insurance covered most of my medical bills (surgery and4 months recoup). We never really broke even with what little his insurance paid.

Here “Uninsured Motorist Coverage.” is an option that cost as much as the basic "no fault" insurence.i IF I have insurence then it should not matter what the other driver has unless I wanted to sue him for damages and nobody is getting shit from an illegal alien. Coverage for the vehicle is an option and again it should not matter what the other driver has.

Posted by: Martini Farmer at November 14, 2025 11:18 AM (NwnyJ) 47 As a former state insurance regulator responsible for the financial analysis of property and casualty insurance companies domiciled in a major southern state 'uninsured motorist' coverage is nothing more than a profit maker for your insurance company. Irrespective of the insurance status of someone who damages your car, your insurance company is 100% on the hook for the damage repair of your car per whatever your policy stipulations are. Paying in advance for uninsured motorists is just giving your company margin. Posted by: allmenroder at November 14, 2025 11:19 AM (nUBV4) 48 it's short-sighted that the author implicitly claims that only "nonstandard insurance providers" are "aggressive about refusing to pay claims." some of the largest carriers in the country have been long known for their refusal to pay out when their insured are clearly at fault, and there are no legal avenues outside of woefully inadequate arbitration services for any restitution. several months ago, my brother's car was totaled by a woman running a red light on the feeder. he had been at his own red light and proceeded into the intersection when it turned green; the woman hit him as he was entering the intersection. despite a witness statement and a police report suggesting that their insured's "failure to obey traffic signal" was the sole cause of the accident, the company refused to pay out the claim because their insured was adamant that she had a green light and there was no video evidence to contradict her. that company was Allstate. it is doubtless that the biden-era influx of illegals has exacerbated the problem, but it's far from the root of the issue...we've just turned into a nation of irresponsible liars all looking out for Number One.

So a relatively minor accident that deploys airbags ends up totalling the car because the cost of replacing the airbags alone (which means the trim the bags exploded through also needs to be replaced) is sometimes 10s of thousands of dollars.

Even in our rural Northern AZ County, the local sheriff and city police departments are still significantly under-staffed -- as who in their right mind would want to go into law enforcement when your Chief and/or DA and/or AG will throw you under the bus, and you might end up in prison for daring to do your job as trained a la Derek Chauvin (and risk being murdered once there to boot)?

Posted by: Commissar of plenty and festive little hats at November 14, 2025 11:33 AM (mOYn9) 85 Buck, that was a great article. I read it all. Thank you. I don't think I fully appreciate how much effort goes into some of these posts around here. The pro-government people would probably suggest the solution is to have a years worth of insurance, maybe even raising the minimum amounts. As we saw during the shutdown though, a significant number of people can't afford food. The insurance companies would probably set people up for a year policy with monthly payments. People would pay for the first month, register the vehicle and then let insurance coverage lapse. I have no idea what the solution could be aside from requiring people to have a years worth of insurance paid before the vehicle could be registered. And that won't happen. Since I like to share food prices to let the Horde know what things are like here in Canada, I have a 10 year old Honda with about 80,000 MILES - I did the conversion - and pay about $1300 a year for good coverage.

As I was driving that car home (at dusk) -- after having owned it for no more than 10 minutes, a large deer running across the divided highway (median covered in trees and shrubbery so I didn't see it coming with my usually excellent peripheral vision) crashed into the left front fender. First time I'd ever hit any animal driving, let alone a deer. The front left tire sounded like it was shredding, so stopped and got out the crowbar to pull the crushed fender back off the tire. Anywho, the highly-rated local body shop was so busy they couldn't get me in until over a month later -- and I was able to drive the vehicle with no issues. After they "repaired" it -- it looked brand new -- as I started to drive it out of their lot, it began shaking violently! I took it back and said "What the hell did you do to my car?" and described the issue. They said it was like that when I brought it in -- total bullshit. They said the last thing they did was take it to Big O Tires down the road for an alignment; well, I was good and proper fucked as they'd cracked a head gasket somehow ... so I had to eat that one.

Posted by: Bulg at November 14, 2025 11:39 AM (77rzZ) When my kids were learning to drive in NoVA, I warned them never, ever to take their eyes off the cars with MD tags because you never, ever know what those drivers are going to do next. Not just the Beltway. Side streets, parking lots, everywhere. Posted by: Zombie Robbo the Llama Butcher at November 14, 2025 11:42 AM (LxER7) 106 When we're out driving around we always pay attention to plates to see if people have a current registration sticker. If not they haven't paid tax, registration and inspection. Sure as shit would have no insurance too. Always see a ton of expired tags.

Posted by: Bulg They have no grounds to do so. Posted by: Tonypete at November 14, 2025 11:43 AM (cYBz/) 111 I also think insurance rates are inflated because good drivers subsidize bad ones. No matter how many accidents or tickets you get, it seems like insurers have to cover you. I know some reckless idiots who had so many points on their license that the state eventually suspended the license. But they had insurance coverage at that time, and again when the suspension period ended. One quite memorable incident involved a guy with a license that was recently unsuspended who drove an exotic car off a bridge. No way this guy should have been driving at all, let alone a $300k car (which was totaled, of course). Posted by: Elric The Blade at November 14, 2025 11:43 AM (iFTx/) 112 Both of my low mileage cars - one 2020 Kia Sedona (base) and one 2014 Subaru Forrester (with bells and whistles) were totaled instead of fixed for the parts. In the accident that was my kid's fault, the insurance company lowballed me greatly and I had to fight for an extra $1K (but they still wouldn't fix). In the other, not my kid's fault, insurance gave $3-4K over worth so it didn;t have to fix. Apparently, tariffs and supply chain are making car fixes very expensive and car parts very valuable. Neither accident deployed airbags, so were low speed, single site accidents on the cars (one on the side, one on the back). Posted by: Nova Local at November 14, 2025 11:43 AM (tOcjL) 113 A base Accord is over 29k, if you want any color other than white, black or gray, that brings it to just under 30k. Any options like floor mat or similar being it over 30k Posted by: Thomas Bender at November 14, 2025 11:33 AM (r6CG0) But it’s not $50k which is what the “omg average car is $50k” articles were implying. The average is skewed heavily by $80, 90k pimped out trucks and SUVs. If you want a basic get me A to B sedan like a Camry or Accord $30kish will buy one. Compact SUVs like a Taos are also in the low $30s.

Body shops will grossly overestimate the damages to a car in order to declare it a total loss, because their profit margin on a total loss is about 95% for the storage fees, gate fees, cleanup fees, teardown fees, admin fees, estimating fees, etc. The gross profit on a repairable car is maybe 20-25%. So the body shops are driving up a HUGE increase through ridiculous fees for doing nothing. And we all pay for it through out premiums. Posted by: DavesNotHere Caliber Collision does a great job.

Posted by: one hour sober at November 14, 2025 11:49 AM (Y1sOo) 133 The concept of "underinsurance" shouldn't be possible, nor should I have to care whether insurance is involved at *all* following an accident. It just shouldn't matter, and if we did insurance differently, it wouldn't. The whole reason for "underinsurance" comes down to three things: 1. Cars are expensive 2. Medical care is ruinously expensive 3. I'm in the hook for 1 and 2. But *why* am I on the hook for it? I shouldn't be, and neither should you. I shouldn't have to carry enough insurance to pay for a Mercedes S-Class and six months of hospitalization. I should pay for *me* and vice-versa. Recast driving as an activity generally to be an assumed-risk activity. Barring recklessness (which is its own category, and for which insurance needn't pay anyway), put *all* liability on the motorist and restrict it to *him* and his passengers. If there's a wreck, even through carelessness or negligence, your fault or not, your insurance pays for your property and care, his pays for his. Or you don't have it. No skin off my back. In the event of recklessness or another voiding issue, the insurance company is welcome to go after you for liability (or I am, if I self-insure).

Mine paid out a claim to someone injured in a rollover (the driver of that vehicle was... you guessed it, uninsured) they claimed I caused (the citation against me was thrown out in court). They didn't think I had any real culpability, but it was easier to simply pay the claim than it was to dispute it. The other reasons are, as you say, Buck, the expense of cars (some of it because of just how expensive they have become, but the other part is low-impact bumpers and such, that used to be handled by putting just a new bumper on - now handled by replacing a huge portion of the rear end, it seems) and the un- and underinsured motorists. As far as expense, vast numbers of cars are simply totalled after an accident, now. Posted by: GWB at November 14, 2025 11:52 AM (9tT1a) 145 Because the insurance being sold by nonstandard insurers is the bare minimum required to get a vehicle registered, that also effectively means that every driver with nonstandard insurance is “underinsured” until their insurance lapses, at which time they are completely uninsured. This also means that pretty much every customer Tricolor sold a vehicle to did not have sufficient insurance coverage to pay for the wrecks they caused. And for every vehicle Tricolor sold, there were many other vehicles sold to the same customer base by other used car dealers. ++++ Which also doesn't matter. You can't get blood from a stone. So he's "underinsured?" You have no recourse. Sure, you can sue him (or your insurance company can), but what will you get for it? Bupkiss. The only time "underinsurance" presents an actual risk is if you *do* have assets worth defending. If you don't, then insurance doesn't matter at all except for ticking the box to avoid getting arrested. Have adequate insurance? Why bother? It costs more and buys you nothing.

But the longer-term issue is automation is coming, and Starbucks is already testing systems that reduce the number of workers needed per store. If the union is planning for true job security, it would make sense to include an automation clause in their demands. Didn’t know there was a strike! Is that why my location was closed. Didn’t even realize it was union. I am so proud of you all and so disappointed in the lack of solidarity I'm seeing on here and in my local stores.

Both of the following are true: 1. Labor is expensive 2. Capital is cheap, especially if you're deep-pocketed corporation who can borrow at hilariously low rates If you artificially make labor expensive, it creates a capital preference for business spending. Insofar as a business *can* shift the ratio to favor capital expenditure, it will. If you artificially make capital cheap (we do), it *also* creates that same capital preference. Boosting the price of labor while capital is cheap just ensures less labor will be used. This is also why capital cost repression (low rates) acts the same as a higher minimum wage... Posted by: Joe Mannix (Not a cop!) at November 14, 2025 11:58 AM (6bTRc) 163 In Texas, you are required to purchase auto insurance. That government mandate creates an artificial scarcity, which drives up insurance rates. The thing that gets me, though, is that they still sell uninsured motorist policies, which you need because the high cost encourages people to get around the mandate. As a bonus, the state's attempt to enforce the mandate leads to lots of opportunities for "big brother" to step in, which of course he does. I guess you could say that I'm not a fan.

State, Local, Federal - and the Corporations. An Illegal Alien totals your car and causes injury in an At Fault collision. The cops will let him go. Nothing they can do, it’s not their purview, besides, they can’t afford to lock him up, and the Feds will just ordinarily let him go. If our government wasn’t so thoroughly corrupted, the Insurance companies could or would send the host countries the bill for their citizens wreaking havoc in OUR country, and the Feds would make it stick with incentives. Or even better, Insurance policies would have an Exclusion - they don’t cover being hit by Illegal Aliens. Sorry. That would get everyone’s attention. This sleight of hand cost shifting is profoundly Wicked and Evil.

The principal that your own Insurance will pay is why your premiums have skyrocketed. Plus Uninsured, Underinsured and decaying cities. Insurance has the principle of Subordination. They will pay your claims. Then they turn around and collect from the other guy’s Insurance. Except, he doesn’t have any. Now what? That’s how “No Fault” and “Uninsured” works. YOU pay for it, one way or another. Always keep in mind, Insurance companies are so hated - almost as much as Lawyers - without much justification. The Politicians have ruined Insurance. Good drivers, good people, make for low premiums. When the State mandates this and that, the costs go up. “You cannot refuse coverage”. At one time, you could not get coverage if you financed a car. What sort of idiot wouldn’t pay cash for a car, and buys on Credit? Bad Risk. Higher incidence of claims. No thank you!

Part of the problem is that even under "no fault" schemes, there is still loads of liability law that makes everything stupendously messy. Driving needs to be fully reclassified and most (or all) of the liability law around it scrapped or it just turns into a shit show that somehow costs even more.

Posted by: DavesNotHere at November 14, 2025 11:21 AM (bUIiy) I recently had dealings with a body shop after hitting a dear with my Silverado. The body shop was a well known long established shop which I have used previously with great satisfaction. Now I wouldn't let them work on a matchbox car. They don't do rust repair. Nobody working there knows how, supposedly. Long lead times for parts. The parts they ordered (Fender, headlight, etc.) wouldn't fit and had to re-order. Then, the body shop tech damaged the truck while driving it into a service bay. ++++ I believe it. There is a huge labor shortage in auto body repair these days. The old timers who actually know how to repair things are retiring (or their bodies are giving out), and kids aren't getting into vocational programs to learn body repair. If you're a competent, qualified auto body technician, you can write your own paychecks, there's such a shortage of labor out there.

They can cancel registrations, and those plates will pop up on every cop's plate scanner. Posted by: CharlieBrown'sDildo The last time I got pulled over, I didn't have proof of insurance in the vehicle because I was borrowing it from my parents and they had all their proof of vehicle insurance on their phones. I still had insurance active on my at-the-time defunct vehicle, because the insurance company didn't offer "garaging" insurance. That the cop didn't give me a ticket for not having proof of insurance leads me to believe that they already have the ability to tell whether a driver has insurance when they run one's ID. ... which I suppose doesn't help when your illegal driver is running around sans ID. Posted by: FeatherBlade at November 14, 2025 01:20 PM (a+4eV) 192 "Compounding the problem is the growing number of drivers who are underinsured" --- IAL and this is one of my primary hobby horses. Your insurance company sells *Under*insured Motorist Coverage, but they don't really push it because they pay out to you under it. I always encourage everyone to check how much Underinsurance Coverage they have--and it is rarely enough. I don't do personal injury law but I did have a few such cases when I was a baby lawyer. In one such, my client was partially disabled by the other driver. She was able to recover all of her and her husband's underinsurance, but it was woefully inadequate. Had they had four times and much, she'd have gotten all of it.

Why can't I take a year or two in that pool? Last year, my daughter was smashed by a car making an illegal turn - grace of God she wasn't hurt; car totaled. Other driver did not speak English and did not have insurance. No arrest, nothing. So although she was 100 percent faultless, prices will go up because *my* insurance company had to pay big.

The Miami-based Securitize, which is planning a public offering, said that BUIDL will be accepted as collateral for trades at the world’s leading cryptocurrency exchange, describing the asset backed by U.S. Treasuries as a tool for institutional traders. BlackRock’s BUIDL fund debuted last March, and the tokenized money market fund has expanded to eight blockchains since, now including the Binance-backed network that dates back to 2019. “We’re continuing to bring regulated real-world assets on-chain while unlocking new forms of utility that were previously out of reach,” co-founder and CEO Carlos Domingo said in a statement. BlackRock’s BUIDL fund, which has around 93 holders, offers a yield. Over the past week, that has averaged 3.7% on an annualized basis, according to crypto data provider RWA.XYZ. Binance’s institutional clients have been asking the exchange for more interest-bearing assets that maintain a stable price, Catherine Chen, head of VIP and institutional at Binance, said in a statement. Chen added that BUIDL was integrated into Ceffu, a Binance-owned custody service, which drew U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission scrutiny in 2023 over its ability to potentially control assets that belonged to Binance’s U.S. affiliate. Binance co-founder Changpeng Zhao, who pleaded guilty to violating U.S. laws against money laundering in 202, was pardoned by President Trump in October. The move has drawn pushback among crypto U.S. Democratic lawmakers. Still, BlackRock’s BUIDL fund represents the latest sign of how Wall Street firms are embracing the exchange’s services and products. This year, retail brokerage Robinhood, as well as crypto exchanges Coinbase and Kraken, have listed BNB, the fifth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko. The coin changed hands around $924 on Friday, representing a 3.4% fall over the past day. The asset hit an all-time high of $1,370 last month, while rising 48% over the past year, but has fallen in recent weeks alongside Bitcoin and most of the market.

This further establishes BUIDL's role as a foundational building block of onchain finance, by enabling the exchange's global user base of institutional and advanced traders to unlock new efficiencies in capital deployment while maintaining exposure to tokenized Treasuries. In parallel, BUIDL is launching a new share class on the BNB Chain network, one of the world's leading blockchain ecosystems, expanding investor access and interoperability with other onchain financial applications. "BUIDL's expansion to BNB Chain and its use as collateral on Binance further extends its reach and utility," said Carlos Domingo, Co-founder and CEO of Securitize. "We're continuing to bring regulated real-world assets onchain while unlocking new forms of utility that were previously out of reach." "Our institutional clients have asked for more interest-bearing stable assets they can hold as collateral while actively trading on our exchange," said Catherine Chen, Head of VIP & Institutional at Binance. "Integrating BUIDL with our banking triparty partners and our crypto-native custody partner, Ceffu, meets their needs and enables our clients to confidently scale allocation while meeting compliance requirements." "BNB Chain is designed for scalable, low-cost, and secure financial applications, and we're excited to welcome BUIDL to our ecosystem," said Sarah Song, Head of Business Development at BNB Chain. "BUIDL is turning real-world assets into programmable financial instruments, enabling entirely new types of investment strategies on-chain." "This milestone highlights our continued focus on transforming tokenization from concept to practical market utility," said Robbie Mitchnick, Global Head of Digital Assets at BlackRock. "By enabling BUIDL to operate as collateral across leading digital market infrastructure, we're helping bring foundational elements of traditional finance into the onchain finance arena." Launched in March 2024, BUIDL was BlackRock's first tokenized fund to be issued on a public blockchain, tokenized by Securitize, offering qualified investors access to U.S. dollar yields with flexible custody, daily dividend payouts, and 24/7/365 peer-to-peer transfers. This integration builds on BUIDL's availability across other leading networks including Arbitrum, Aptos, Avalanche, Ethereum, Optimism, Polygon and Solana.

Title: BlackRock’s $2.5 billion tokenized money market fund gets boost with Binance tie-up
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/11/14/blackrocks-2-5-billion-tokenized-money-market-fund-gets-boost-with-binance-tie-up/
Time Published: 2025-11-14T13:30:00Z

Jeff John Roberts is the Finance and Crypto editor at Fortune, overseeing coverage of the blockchain and how technology is changing finance. Institutional trading of digital assets is already big business. Now, it’s set to get even bigger as Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, announced on Friday that it will now accept collateral in the form of a popular token issued by BlackRock. The token, known as BUIDL, trades at $1 and is backed by a reserve of Treasury bills and other safe, short-term assets. The news of the Binance tie-up is significant because it will likely further increase the popularity of BUIDL, which the world’s largest asset manager launched last year. Since then, its market cap has grown to over $2.5 billion. BUIDL operates much like a stablecoin, and is often used as collateral for trading crypto derivatives. It is available, though, only to large institutional investors, including private equity firms and hedge funds, that invest at least $5 million into the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund. The token is especially attractive to big investors since, unlike stablecoins like Tether and USDC, it pays out the yield it collects from its reserves. The current yield is roughly around 4%, with BlackRock charging a management fee of 0.2% to 0.5%. To create the token, BlackRock works with a firm called Securitize that specializes in issuing digital assets. In an interview with Fortune, Securitize CEO Carlos Domingo said BUIDL is attractive to institutional traders because of the yield it pays, but also because it is viewed by exchanges as high value collateral that can allow its holders to borrow more. Domingo also said that tokenized assets are gaining popularity more broadly because they offer a quick and efficient way to settle trades. “In capital markets, every transaction involves updating a ledger. Right now, the ledgers are built on software from the 1970s, and the process is siloed,” said Domingo. In contrast, he noted, blockchains are easy to access and can settle trades almost instantly. As part of its latest push deeper into crypto, BlackRock will also issue a new class of shares of BUIDL on the BNB chain, a blockchain launched by Binance that is today largely decentralized. Binance’s decision to add BUIDL comes at a time when the exchange giant is increasing ties to the traditional financial sector. In a statement, the company’s Head of VIP & Institutional, Catherine Chen, said adding BUIDL came partly in response to customer requests. “Integrating BUIDL with our banking triparty partners and our crypto-native custody partner, Ceffu, meets their needs and enables our clients to confidently scale allocation while meeting compliance requirements,” said Chen. Friday’s BUIDL news comes after other big crypto derivative platforms, including Coinbase-owned Deribit, did the same in recent months. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Share this article BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, deposited 2,310 Bitcoin worth $222 million and 43,240 Ethereum worth around $137 million into Coinbase today. The transfer represents the latest institutional movement involving the two leading crypto assets amid ongoing ETF activity. BlackRock’s recent Bitcoin and Ethereum deposits to Coinbase have sparked speculation about potential selling pressure following ETF outflows. Roughly $867 million exited US-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs yesterday, alongside $260 million withdrawn from Ethereum ETFs. BlackRock’s IBIT saw the largest daily outflow among crypto ETPs.

The group met with investors, including Pacific Investment Management Co (PIMCO), BlackRock and Vanguard during non-deal roadshows last week ahead of the bond issue likely to close by January-end, the sources said, requesting anonymity, as they are not authorised to speak to media. Goswami Infratech, PIMCO, Vanguard and BlackRock did not reply to a Reuters email seeking comment. The real estate and civil engineering company is planning to raise around ₹2,500 crore ($2.8 billion) through a two-year zero-coupon bond issue, and is willing to offer a yield of 19.75 per cent, the sources said. The yield being offered on these notes is comparable to what another SP group entity Porteast Investment offered when it raised ₹28,600 crore in the largest ever bond sale for India in May. Talks are at an early stage and no investment commitments have been made so far, the sources added. The funds will be used to refinance its outstanding ₹8,815 crore in high-yield notes maturing in April 2026 and another loan, as well as for other debt-related and corporate purposes. The company has already repaid more than a third of the earlier bond, according to Care Ratings, which maintains a BB-rating on the papers. The new issue will be secured by the SP Group's 9.2 per cent stake in Tata Sons, held via its subsidiary Cyrus Investments.

There were always going to be changes for the Australia game. The Japan game was going to see the younger players given a chance. It's great to see Mack Hansen back in the side. All of his 27 caps have been on the wing. It's a first opportunity at full-back and I'm really looking forward to seeing him. Paddy McCarthy is starting up front ahead of Andrew Porter. He's only been involved in 10 games for Leinster. He's up against a really experienced operator in Alan Ala'alatoa, whose brother Michael played for Leinster. In the back row, I felt that when Caelan Doris was shifted to number 7 that he'd start there this week. Josh van der Flier has been such an outstanding player in that position but I think Andy (Farrell) is looking for alternatives. Sam Prendergast is back at 10, which was always going to happen. Jack Crowley, I think, is earmarked to play against South Africa but that will depend on what happens tomorrow. Not only do we need a win, we need a performance. I think the fact that Italy beat Australia last week, if anything, puts more pressure on Ireland. South Africa are coming down the line. I think Ireland will win but they have to lift performance. The only thing that makes me nervous is one man - and that's Joe Schmidt. We know what he can do. He's an outstanding coach and he'll want to win this one.

Title: Fear Not: Bitcoin Whale Selling Doesn’t Point To A Crypto Meltdown—Analysts

Bitcoin dropped to $96,000 on heavy selling Friday, and falling risk appetite, leaving traders and analysts parsing whether this is normal profit-taking or a larger turning point for the market. According to on-chain and market reports, the drop wiped out more than $700 million in long positions and left November down by more than 10%. Reports have disclosed that a wallet tied to trader Owen Gunden moved 2,400 Bitcoin — about $237 million — onto the Kraken exchange, a transfer tracked by blockchain watcher Arkham. Based on analysis by Glassnode, long-term holders’ average daily spending rose from over 12,000 BTC per day in early July to roughly 26,000 BTC per day as of this week. OWEN GUNDEN JUST SOLD ANOTHER $290M BTC Owen Gunden just moved all of the remaining BTC out of his accounts. He deposited over HALF of his holdings directly into Kraken, depositing a total of $290.7M of BTC into Kraken. He now has only $250M of Bitcoin remaining. pic.twitter.com/ZUB3aToAgH — Arkham (@arkham) November 13, 2025 That pattern, Glassnode analysts say, looks like orderly distribution by older holders rather than a sudden mass exit. It is being framed as late-cycle profit-taking: regular, steady, and spread out. According to Santiment, Bitcoin has fallen below $100K for the second time this month, triggering a burst of fear and worried posts from retail traders. 📉 Bitcoin has dumped below $100K for the second time this month. Predictably, this has caused a wave of FUD and concerned social media posts from retail traders.

He cautioned that this phase doesn’t automatically signal a final peak, provided there are still buyers ready to take in the extra supply. Being in a late cycle doesn’t mean the market has hit a ceiling, he pointed out. It just shows momentum has eased, and bigger forces like macro trends and liquidity are now in control, he said. “Rate-cut doubts and recent market weakness have slowed the climb, not ended it,” Liu said. In other words, there’s no meltdown or anything like it. On-chain indicators are being watched closely; Bitcoin’s net unrealized profit ratio stood near 0.476, a level some traders interpret as hinting at short-term lows forming. That reading is only one of several signals, Liu added, and must be tracked alongside liquidity and macro conditions. A closer look at the monthly average spending by long-term holders reveals a clear trend: outflows have climbed from roughly 12.5k BTC/day in early July to 26.5k BTC/day today (30D-SMA). This steady rise reflects increasing distribution pressure from older investor cohorts — a… pic.twitter.com/wECe58CV66 — glassnode (@glassnode) November 13, 2025 The cryptocurrency sell-off came as crypto-related stocks plunged. Broader markets were weak as well, with the Nasdaq down 2% and the S&P 500 off 1.3%. Cipher Mining fell 14%, Riot Platforms and Hut 8 dropped 13%, while MARA Holdings and Bitmine Immersion slid over 10%. Coinbase and Strategy were down about 7%. Based on reports, large institutional flows have pressured prices. Firms including BlackRock, Binance and Wintermute reportedly sold more than $1 billion in Bitcoin, a wave of selling that produced a quick 5% drop inside minutes. Meanwhile, social sentiment turned sharply negative, and the Crypto Fear & Greed Index hit 15, reflecting “extreme fear” among traders.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Let CFO.com's free newsletter keep you informed, straight from your inbox. Waymo appoints a Google finance leader as CFO, Gopuff hires a former BlackRock exec and Disney extends its finance chief’s contract. Waymo, Alphabet’s self-driving car unit, appointed Steve Fieler as its new CFO. Fieler most recently served on Google’s CFO leadership team, where he was vice president of planning, business operations, investments,= and investor relations. He was previously business finance officer for Google's platforms and ecosystems unit. Before joining Google in 2020, he was HP's finance chief. Earlier roles include CFO of digital health company Proteus Digital Health and CFO of HP Software. Fieler succeeds Elisa de Martel, who is stepping down after three years in the role. Matt McBrady was appointed finance chief of delivery service Gopuff. McBrady previously worked at BlackRock as chief investment officer of its multi-strategy hedge fund program and held senior leadership roles at Bain Capital and Silver Creek Capital Management. He also held leadership positions at Axon and aQuantive, where he led both firms through IPOs. McBrady served on former President Bill Clinton’s Council of Economic Advisers, ​​where he worked for Janet Yellen as an international economist.

His previous contract was set to expire on Dec. 31, 2026, the same date as CEO Bob Iger’s contract ends.

Title: US regulator mulls guidance for tokenized deposit insurance, stablecoins

Time Published: 2025-11-14T05:57:37Z

Acting FDIC Chair Travis Hill said the agency is also working on a regime for stablecoin issuance and expects to issue a proposal for an application process by the end of year. The acting chair of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the regulatory body overseeing banks in the US, is reportedly considering guidance for tokenized deposit insurance and plans to launch an application process for stablecoins by year’s end. Acting FDIC Chair Travis Hill, who has made bullish statements about tokenization in the past, told the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s Fintech Conference on Thursday that the regulator will eventually release guidance around tokenized deposit insurance, according to reports. The FDIC protects depositors in the event of a bank failure and insures money in accounts at banks that are insured by the regulator. “My view for a long time has been that a deposit is a deposit. Moving a deposit from a traditional-finance world to a blockchain or distributed-ledger world shouldn’t change the legal nature of it,” Hill said, as reported by Bloomberg. Regulators and Wall Street have shown serious interest in the real-world asset (RWA) tokenization sector this year. Excluding stablecoins, the total value of tokenized real-world assets surpassed $24 billion in the first half of the year, with private credit and US Treasurys making up the bulk of the market, according to a report by RedStone. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, is one of the most prominent players in the space and launched a tokenized money market fund called BUIDL in 2024. At the same time, Hill reportedly announced the agency is also working on a regime for stablecoin issuance and expects to issue a proposal for an application process by the end of 2025 as part of its duties in crafting rules under the GENIUS Act, according to Law360. Related: Tokenization demand is no longer tied to Bitcoin: Galaxy executive He said it’s still too early to know how many institutions will be interested, but the FDIC staff is working on the standards around capital requirements, reserve requirements and risk management for FDIC-regulated stablecoin issuers. Stablecoins have also been a high-growth area, with banks worldwide exploring this technology. The market capitalization of stablecoins is approximately $305 billion as of Friday, according to blockchain analytics platform DefiLlama.

Title: Ethereum (ETH) Rebounds as 43-Day U.S. Shutdown Ends, Vitalik Buterin Outlines Scaling Roadmap

Ethereum (ETH) is showing renewed strength after the U.S. government ended its historic 43-day shutdown, an event that had weighed heavily on investor confidence across global markets. Related Reading: Ethereum’s Fusaka Upgrade Is Just Around The Corner—What To Expect ETH price is currently hovering above the $3,400 support zone after a volatile week marked by ETF outflows, declining volume, and intense bearish sentiment. The broader crypto market reacted positively to news of the shutdown’s resolution, helping Ethereum climb 3.18% on the day and outperform Bitcoin with a 3% gain. Analysts now expect ETH to rise toward $3,814 by November 18, representing a potential 10.37% short-term upside. Despite the improved macro backdrop, Ethereum remains in a challenging technical position. Key support lies at $3,333 and $3,300, while resistance at $3,590 and $3,666 will determine whether ETH can break its current downtrend. ETF products continue to show weakness, with all nine Ethereum ETFs recording zero inflows and a combined $107 million in outflows, suggesting institutions remain cautious. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin added optimism to the week by outlining a refreshed scaling roadmap and highlighting DeFi’s evolution into a viable global savings tool. He emphasized that the DeFi ecosystem is now “night and day” safer compared to 2020, citing better security audits, stronger protocols, and improved user-fund recovery mechanisms through innovations like the “walkaway test.” Central to Buterin’s roadmap is Ethereum’s ongoing Layer 1 and Layer 2 scaling strategy. With rollups, data availability upgrades, and new high-throughput solutions, such as systems already achieving over 10,000 transactions per second, Buterin believes Ethereum is on track to support the next wave of DeFi adoption. He urged developers to maintain Ethereum’s core values: openness, censorship resistance, and interoperability. Buterin warned that abandoning these principles risks turning Ethereum into a “walled garden,” undermining the ecosystem’s global mission. A growing bright spot for Ethereum is the explosive expansion of tokenised real-world assets (RWAs). More than $200 billion worth of RWAs now sit on-chain, driven by major institutions such as BlackRock and Fidelity. The BUIDL fund’s tokenised Treasury products, built natively on Ethereum, showcase the network’s rising importance in traditional finance. Institutional RWA assets have surged nearly 2,000% since January 2024, strengthening Ethereum’s long-term fundamentals even as short-term volatility persists. Related Reading: European Banking Regulator Says EU Crypto Framework Addresses ECB’s Stablecoin Concerns Technically, Ethereum remains in a descending channel from its failed August rally toward $5,000. Analysts note that a decisive breakout above $3,700 could flip market structure bullish and reopen paths toward $4,700, especially if macro stability continues after the shutdown settlement.

Title: Ursula von der Leyen Wants More Money

Full Content:
While the German chancellor burns taxpayer money in the Amazon jungle to “save” the rainforests, his own advisor, Clemens Fuest, is warning of the return of a planned economy and looming shortages. Meanwhile, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen rallies the climate faithful for yet another harvest season. A Home Game in Belém Last Friday was something of a home game for Chancellor Friedrich Merz. At the climate summit in Belém, Brazil -- which, incidentally, translates as “Bethlehem” and was meant to remind what remains of the local Christian community of the “holy” significance of the gathering -- he found himself among old friends. The media, and only the media, dictate what exists and what doesn’t. And this time, everything revolved around Ursula von der Leyen’s sermon on the state of the world’s climate, cast in simple yet precise apocalyptic tones. Von der Leyen Takes the Stage In Belém, she clearly set the tone -- eager to keep the panic level demanded by climate groups like Fridays for Future as high as humanly possible. Let’s be honest: COP30, like the entire climate club, has already seen its best days. Things ran much smoother when, alongside the EU’s capital pump, the Americans were still flooding the “green economy” with ever-growing rivers of cash. But that party ended with Donald Trump’s election. Major asset managers like BlackRock and Goldman Sachs are now aligning their ETFs and investment vehicles once again with real economic demand -- that of a world hungry for energy to feed exploding data centers, AI models, autonomous vehicles, and chip production. Not that anyone at COP30, or in Berlin for that matter, seems troubled by such details. New capital sources are being “opened,” CO2 taxes are flowing, and Germany’s many “special funds” are ready to be deployed. Last Exit: The Climate Business Von der Leyen once again illustrated Brussels’ unshakable faith that a state-planned green pseudo-economy represents the final exit from the accelerating economic crisis of our age. By 2030, she wants to triple the global share of renewables and double energy efficiency. What, one wonders, do the Chinese think of that -- as they build new coal plants at record pace? Or the Americans, who just quit the Climate Inc. altogether, opting for a deregulated energy market freed from the green command economy? Von der Leyen, however, invited her audience on a journey to fairyland -- EU-style, dreamy, green-tinted, and disconnected from reality. The Commission President declared, with evident pride, that EU member states now have a “crystal-clear commitment” to reduce CO2 emissions by 90 percent by 2040. Europe, she said, is “on track” -- and now stands ready to “share its experience” with partners around the world. The whole world, von der Leyen insisted, should benefit from the “advantages” (sic!) of the energy transition. For the German delegation -- representing the economically crumbling Vatican of the climate cult -- that must have been the moment when even the long drink froze in hand. The CO2 Business Model No one bends reality into green, molten steel quite like Ursula von der Leyen. A master of turning dysfunction into virtue, she knows that marketing is everything -- and the best marketing for a broken product lies in perpetual apocalypse. Under her spell, even the chancellor couldn’t resist. Merz promptly pledged €6 billion of German taxpayers’ money to “save” the tropical forests. And let’s not kid ourselves: this money will make some climate entrepreneurs and their clans very happy indeed. Which, after all, is the point. The climate economy, in all its tangled branches -- insulation panels, heat pumps, wind turbines planted in forests -- thrives on a moral narrative that translates every act of human life into carbon sin. That’s how taxpayers are blackmailed and the middle class is bled dry. The method requires only a packed travel schedule and omnipresence in the media cycle. The Dream Sequence Reaches Its Climax It all felt a bit like Jack Kerouac’s Book of Dreams: episodes blending the absurd, the half-true, and the utterly fantastical. Von der Leyen reached the peak of her detachment from reality when she turned political. Carbon pricing, she preached, had “proven one of the strongest instruments for climate protection,” effectively shutting down any homefront debate about the collapsing carbon credit system. Nothing may exist that the central planning office brands as heresy. Thus, the recent criticism by the CEOs of BASF and Evonik -- two pillars of German industry -- must be dismissed as “conflicted.” To comfort the mourning congregation of Germany’s shrinking industrial base, Merz proposed a predictable remedy: subsidies and a state-guaranteed “industrial electricity price.” One thing remains constant: higher taxes and levies will, supposedly, keep the global temperature in check. On that point, everyone in the faith agrees. Back to the Climate Vatican During his rainforest pilgrimage, the German delegation emitted roughly 65 tons of CO2 -- not bad for a summit about reducing emissions. (Assuming the chancellor’s Air Force One is airworthy, it still doesn’t run on sunflower oil.) But Merz needn’t travel so far to witness the absurd theater of the CO2 faithful. Back home, the Bundestag is working with Prussian precision to turn the country into one of the most dazzling tragicomic stages of our time. On Thursday, parliament passed the amendment to the Carbon Storage Act -- allowing CO2 to be captured, transported, and stored under the seabed of the North Sea. The technology, known as Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS), is supposed to help “energy-intensive” sectors like cement, steel, and chemicals -- industries the government blames for the climate crisis in the first place. In plain English: subsidies are now being poured into a brand-new infrastructure that serves an industry which produces nothing. The capital siphoned from the free market through tax privileges and green subsidies will literally be sunk into the sea. That’s East German economics -- wrapped in eco-soundtrack. The End is Nigh We can conclude that the media have succeeded in transmitting the festive mood from Brussels’ central committee back home -- business is running smoothly, apocalypse sells well, and the Amazon provides the perfect backdrop. No piranhas in sight during the boat ride either. But as you know from your own parties, there’s always that one guest who ruins the buzz -- the one who dares to bring up politics or question the narrative. That role now belongs to economist and government advisor Clemens Fuest. He couldn’t resist reminding everyone, in an interview with Bild am Sonntag, that Germany -- after years of stagnation (he politely avoided saying “recession”) -- is heading straight toward shortage economics. That, of course, describes the classic modus vivendi of socialist regimes, where a small, insulated elite allocates resources at will and doles out investments according to political loyalty. Sound familiar? Fuest might want to ask himself where exactly we are in the economic timeline -- and what role the climate circus plays in establishing this very regime he’s warning about. Should enlightenment strike, his ethical duty as a scientist would be clear: to stand on the side of freedom.
