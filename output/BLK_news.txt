According to "Naftemporiki" sources, the highest participation was recorded by private investors rather than institutional investors, while in the international book the lead (over 70%) was held by the "heavy" names, such as Lazard Asset Management, RWC, Wellington, Capital World, Blackrock and Fidelity, among others According to “Naftemporiki” sources, the highest participation was recorded by private investors rather than institutional investors, while in the international book the lead (over 70%) was held by the “heavy” names, such as Lazard Asset Management, RWC, Wellington, Capital World, Blackrock and Fidelity, among others. A smaller percentage was secured by investors with a short-term investment horizon such as hedge funds. It is recalled that of the total shares allocated, 15% ended up in the hands of investors in Greece and the remaining 85% to foreign investors. The placement was oversubscribed by 10.4 times in total (12 times in the international offer and 1.5 times in the Greek offer). The final sale price of the HFSF shares was significantly lower than the initial estimates, at 7.55 euros from 7.95 euros that the shareholder had initially set the threshold. Both the war conflicts in the Middle East and the shareholder’s overestimation of the success of the transaction played a role in this development. According to market sources, the HFSF “fell a victim” of its success with Piraeus Bank where the placement was completed with a marginal premium.

Title: BlackRock: Bitcoin is ‘gold alternative,’ Ethereum a ‘technology bet’ – Why?

Here’s BlackRock’s insights and selling points for BTC and ETH. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, recently presented unique yet different pitch decks for Bitcoin [BTC] and Ethereum [ETH]. The dual pitch deck was presented during a digital assets conference held in Brazil. BlackRock’s Robbie Mitchnick presented BTC as a ‘risk-off’ asset, putting it at par with or better than gold. On the other hand, ETH was pitched as a ‘risk-on’ asset, similar to U.S. stocks. The asset manager praised BTC as a global monetary alternative and an excellent hedge against declining trust in governments and fiat currencies’ relentless debasement (devaluation). Source: BlackRock On the contrary, ETH was showcased as a speculative bet on blockchain technology adoption, an investment that Mitchnick equated to US stocks. He noted, “On one hand, you have BTC, a commodity like gold and an alternative to stocks and bonds. Ethereum, more of a long-term technology bet that this blockchain will provide more use cases and more value to the economy going forward.” Part of the crypto community echoed Mitchnick’s presentations, underscoring that BTC is ‘money’ with less inflationary pressure than fiat currencies, which lose value annually. But it also settled the raging debate that has been going on for a while: ETH isn’t money. In fact, since the introduction of Blobs earlier this year, ETH’s inflation has hiked, making it less of an “ultra-sound money.” If the projections hold, BTC could rally more during future geopolitical tensions, while ETH could decline in such scenarios. BlackRock’s perspective is crucial since it is a trendsetter and widely accredited. Along with Grayscale, the asset managers are perceived to be responsible for the US shift and final approval of US spot BTC ETFs. Since the ETFs debuted, BlacRock’s ETFs have outperformed every alternative offering and crossed key milestones. At the time of writing, its BTC ETF, iShares Bitcoin Trust [IBIT], had a cumulative netflow of $21.5 billion with nearly $23 billion in net assets. That said, since it began trading in July, BlacRock’s ETH ETF, ETHA, has netted $1.1 billion in total inflows. Ergo, the world’s largest asset manager, could influence how other investors view the sector. According to some market observers, the message seems clear — Bitcoin is money, while the rest of crypto is speculative. In the meantime, BTC was valued at $62K, down 5% on the weekly charts. On the other hand, ETH was valued at $2.4K, down 8.5% over the same period. Disclaimer: AMBCrypto's content is meant to be informational in nature and should not be interpreted as investment advice.

"What kind of effect did this pernicious predatory culture have on all the bystanders? The boys who were lucky enough to escape being raped, but who watched their fellow pupils being publicly molested and humiliated?" Photo: Getty Of all the accounts I’ve read about the sexual abuse of children at the hands of men in cassocks – purporting to be teachers or counsellors, when in fact they were predatory paedophiles, gaining access to their preferred prey by exploiting the trust of naive, well-intended parents – it was that of Séan Duke that kept playing over and over in my mind. He wasn’t, thankfully (I might once have said thank God, but the cultural influence of the church has waned in every way in Ireland over the course of my life, much of that down to the actions of these craven men) raped himself. Instead he talked about what he bore witness to; the myriad of more minor sexual assaults that took place in plain sight in Willow Park and Blackrock College on a regular basis during his time there.

Title: Tafe and Agco: How did the tractor partners fall out of love?

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. Growing anxiety over Tractors and Farm Equipment Ltd's (Tafe) rising ownership in Agco Corp., plus its demand for board-level changes at the US-based tractor maker, prompted the latter to snap its brand agreement with the Chennai-based company, according to Tafe's court filings, as well as a senior company executive. After discontinuing some business ties with Tafe earlier this year, Agco on 30 September terminated its agreement that allowed Tafe to sell tractors under the Massey Ferguson brand, accusing the Indian company of what it called inappropriate and unauthorized actions. The developments come as a possible case of shareholder activism by a homegrown entity rattling a large foreign company. Two reasons“The Tafe-Agco matter has been triggered by two fundamental reasons. One, as you said citing legal documents, is perhaps because the executive (Agco CEO EricHansotia) was concerned about the rising ownership of Tafe in Agco," said T.R. Kesavan, group president, corporate relations and alliances, Tafe. Tafe first acquired a 12.5% stake in Agco in 2012, a year after Tafe chairman and managing director Mallika Srinivasan joined the board of the US company. Tafe has since increased its stake in Agco, touching 16.31% at the end ofSeptember2024, making it the single-largest shareholder in the world's third-largest tractor maker. Also read | TAFE presses AGCO to refresh board, consider alternativesTafe's submission to a Chennai court on 8 August said, “As between 2014-2024, the shareholding of the first plaintiff (Tafe) in the second defendant (Agco Corp) had risen to 16.3% and since the first plaintiff had become the single largest shareholder, the same had made the second defendant uncomfortable. Therefore, to force the plaintiff to a standstill agreement and to reduce its stake in the second defendant, without any justification whatsoever, the defendants issued a letter, dated 26.04.2024, unilaterally terminating the agreement between the parties concerning Turkey". Another angleKesavan provided another angle to the issue. “But the other equally important reason is that the largest shareholder, Tafe, has been urging Agco for a few years now that Agco should split the role of chairman and CEO. Tafe is the largest shareholder, a long-term strategic shareholder, a patient investor whose interests are completely aligned with those of other shareholders," said Kesavan. On the question of whether Tafe would like to increase its stake in Agco, which had a market cap of $7.3 billion as of 4 October, Kesavan said Tafe has written to all shareholders, highlighting its concerns. However, he reiterated a standstill agreement limits Tafe from owning more shares in Agco. “Please remember Tafe has not sold a single share since we invested in Agco in 2012. The commercial matters are sub-judice as it is in court, and I am afraid I cannot comment on these," he said. Also read | Mallika Srinivasan appointed chairperson of Public Enterprises Selection BoardAn email sent to Agco on 1 October remained unanswered. The roots of dispute date to 2022, a year after Hansotia became the chair and CEO of Agco in January 2021. Citing Hansotia's lack of experience running a large business, Srinivasan suggested to the Agco board that the roles of chair and CEO should be split some time in early 2022, a Tafe executive privy to the development said on the condition of anonymity. In April this year, Agco ended some business relationships with Tafe, citing the company’s “continued poor operational performance as a supplier, brand licensee and distributor to Agco" and “continued lack of focus on Agco customers in several key markets". Finally, on 30 September, Agco said it was ending, with immediate effect, its agreement with Tafe that allowed the homegrown company to sell tractors under the Massey Ferguson brand. This prompted a Tafe executive to write to Agco's shareholders, underlining what it said were strategic missteps, poor execution, and underperformance by the US company. Tafe also secured a reprieve from a court in Chennai, which put on hold the dissolution of the agreement between the two companies. Call for changes“Tafe calls for shareholder-driven boardroom changes, citing issues such as missed market opportunities, unsuccessful acquisitions, and ballooning costs," P. Krishnamurthy, corporate advisor to Tafe, said in a letter dated 30 September. “Rather than engage constructively with Tafe, the board has taken measures to disenfranchise Tafe and isolate Tafe’s representative from meaningful boardroom involvement," the letter said. Founded in 1990, Agco does not have a promoter and counts money managers Vanguard and Blackrock as its second and third largest shareholders, owning 10.5% and 7.1% respectively, as of 30 June. Its revenue improved 13.9% from the year-ago period to $14.41 billion in the year ended December 2023, while profit jumped 34.4% to $1.7 billion. Also read | Chennai court allows TAFE to continue with Massey Ferguson trademark useFor now, Srinivasan’s central demand for splitting the CEO and chair roles at Agco does not appear to have found much support from other shareholders. In April this year, 15 of the 20 largest public shareholders, who own 56% of Agco, voted to reappoint Hansotia as director. Sole dissenterThe sole dissenter was Norway’s Norges Bank Investment Management, the world’s biggest sovereign wealth fund, which owns 0.91% of Agco, according to filings reviewed by Mint. “The board should exercise objective judgment on corporate affairs and be able to make decisions independently of management. The roles of chairperson and CEO should not be held by the same individual," reasoned Norges, as it rejected the reappointment of Hansotia. “Where a company founder combines both roles, we may support this for a limited period, provided the board has put in place measures to mitigate any conflicts of interest." Also read | Massey Ferguson scraps 28-year partnership with TAFE over breach of agreementsTafe was founded in 1961 by Srinivasan’s grandfather, Sivasailam Anantharamakrishnan, the founder of the Amalgamations Group. Privately held Tafe is the country’s second-largest tractor maker, behind leader Mahindra and Mahindra. In the year ended March 2023, it had ₹12,619 crore in revenue and ₹1,278 crore in profit. Agco owns 20.7% of Tafe, while Simpson & Co Ltd, the holding company of the Amalgamations group, holds the remaining 79.3% of shares. An Agco executive, Robert Crain, is also on the Tafe board. “The Tafe-Agco matter has been triggered by two fundamental reasons.

Citing Hansotia's lack of experience running a large business, Srinivasan suggested to the Agco board that the roles of chair and CEO should be split some time in early 2022, a Tafe executive privy to the development said on the condition of anonymity. In April this year, Agco ended some business relationships with Tafe, citing the company’s “continued poor operational performance as a supplier, brand licensee and distributor to Agco" and “continued lack of focus on Agco customers in several key markets". Finally, on 30 September, Agco said it was ending, with immediate effect, its agreement with Tafe that allowed the homegrown company to sell tractors under the Massey Ferguson brand. This prompted a Tafe executive to write to Agco's shareholders, underlining what it said were strategic missteps, poor execution, and underperformance by the US company. Tafe also secured a reprieve from a court in Chennai, which put on hold the dissolution of the agreement between the two companies. Call for changes“Tafe calls for shareholder-driven boardroom changes, citing issues such as missed market opportunities, unsuccessful acquisitions, and ballooning costs," P. Krishnamurthy, corporate advisor to Tafe, said in a letter dated 30 September. “Rather than engage constructively with Tafe, the board has taken measures to disenfranchise Tafe and isolate Tafe’s representative from meaningful boardroom involvement," the letter said. Founded in 1990, Agco does not have a promoter and counts money managers Vanguard and Blackrock as its second and third largest shareholders, owning 10.5% and 7.1% respectively, as of 30 June. Its revenue improved 13.9% from the year-ago period to $14.41 billion in the year ended December 2023, while profit jumped 34.4% to $1.7 billion.

In April this year, 15 of the 20 largest public shareholders, who own 56% of Agco, voted to reappoint Hansotia as director. Sole dissenterThe sole dissenter was Norway’s Norges Bank Investment Management, the world’s biggest sovereign wealth fund, which owns 0.91% of Agco, according to filings reviewed by Mint. “The board should exercise objective judgment on corporate affairs and be able to make decisions independently of management. The roles of chairperson and CEO should not be held by the same individual," reasoned Norges, as it rejected the reappointment of Hansotia. “Where a company founder combines both roles, we may support this for a limited period, provided the board has put in place measures to mitigate any conflicts of interest." Also read | Massey Ferguson scraps 28-year partnership with TAFE over breach of agreementsTafe was founded in 1961 by Srinivasan’s grandfather, Sivasailam Anantharamakrishnan, the founder of the Amalgamations Group. Privately held Tafe is the country’s second-largest tractor maker, behind leader Mahindra and Mahindra. In the year ended March 2023, it had ₹12,619 crore in revenue and ₹1,278 crore in profit. Agco owns 20.7% of Tafe, while Simpson & Co Ltd, the holding company of the Amalgamations group, holds the remaining 79.3% of shares. An Agco executive, Robert Crain, is also on the Tafe board. Kesavan provided another angle to the issue. “But the other equally important reason is that the largest shareholder, Tafe, has been urging Agco for a few years now that Agco should split the role of chairman and CEO. Tafe is the largest shareholder, a long-term strategic shareholder, a patient investor whose interests are completely aligned with those of other shareholders," said Kesavan. On the question of whether Tafe would like to increase its stake in Agco, which had a market cap of $7.3 billion as of 4 October, Kesavan said Tafe has written to all shareholders, highlighting its concerns. However, he reiterated a standstill agreement limits Tafe from owning more shares in Agco. “Please remember Tafe has not sold a single share since we invested in Agco in 2012. The commercial matters are sub-judice as it is in court, and I am afraid I cannot comment on these," he said.

Gold prices slipped after a stronger-than-expected U.S. jobs report poured cold water on expectations for an aggressive rate cut from the Federal Reserve next month, boosting the dollar. U.S. job growth accelerated in September and the unemployment rate slipped to 4.1%, further easing pressure on the Fed to deliver another 50 basis point rate cut at its Nov. 6-7 policy meeting. US non-farm payrolls showed job additions of 254K against the expectations of 150K and 72K of upward revisions to the past two months of data. Similarly, unemployment data was also reported lower than expectations of 4.1% v/s 4.2%. The dollar index, opens new tab jumped to a seven-week high against its major crosses, after the jobs data. Traders scaled back expectations for a 50 bps rate cut in November to almost 0% from 28%, weighing on metals. Israeli military strikes across Gaza Strip killed at least 29 Palestinians, and sirens blared in Israel in response to renewed rocket fire from militants in the Palestinian enclave. After Iran launching several missiles on Israel market participants are awaiting strong retaliatory response from the latter, increasing the risk premium further for bullions. Nifty 50 is managing to sustain above 25,000. However, the index seems to be lacking a strong follow-through buying. It is currently trading at 25,070, up 0.22 per cent. The advances/declines ratio is at 22:28. This leaves the bias negative and can keep alive the danger of dragging the Nifty below 25,000. Read more The rupee rose 2 paise to 83.97 against the US dollar in early trade on Monday, aided by a weaker greenback in the international market and a drop in crude oil prices. The increase in the country’s forex reserves to a new all-time high of $704.88 billion on Friday further pushed the domestic currency, according to forex traders. However, growing escalation of the conflict in the Middle East and FIIs outflow on Friday capped sharp gains in the domestic unit, they said.

Escalating tensions increased demand for safe-haven assets, driving gold to record highs and silver to a 12-year peak. However, gains were limited by the strengthening dollar and rising U.S. bond yields. Strong non-farm payroll data in the U.S. pushed both the dollar index and 10-year bond yields to two-month highs. Additionally, rising crude oil prices tempered expectations of aggressive rate cuts by the U.S. Federal Reserve, causing gold and silver prices to retreat from their peaks. Gold has support at $2,631-$2,610, with resistance at $2,662-$2,678. Silver has support at $31.82-$31.68 and resistance at $32.35-$32.52. In INR, gold has support at ₹75,880-₹75,670, with resistance at ₹76,450-₹76,650. Silver has support at ₹92,850-₹92,050, while resistance is at ₹94,130-₹94,980. de CRUDE OIL Crude oil prices experienced significant volatility last week, recovering from their lows to reach five-week highs, driven by heightened tensions in the Middle East and better-than-expected U.S. non-farm payroll data. Israel’s military actions against Lebanon and its threats of retaliation against Iran in response to missile attacks on Israel have further unsettled global oil markets. The crude oil prices rose due to positive U.S. economic data, including the non-farm payroll report and the unemployment rate. The reopening of Chinese markets this week, combined with recent stimulus measures, is expected to boost China’s oil demand, providing further support to prices. However, gains are being capped by the upcoming OPEC+ production hike starting in December and the strengthening U.S. dollar. We expect crude oil prices to remain volatile during today’s session. Crude oil has support at $73.10–$72.50 and resistance at $74.20–$75.00. In INR, crude oil has support at ₹6,250–₹6,180 and resistance at ₹6,420–₹6,480.

Geo-political factors, new SEBI rules on F&O, and October seasonality also played a role. We believe the worst of the geo-political impact and China-related issues is now behind us. We began purchasing equities in a significant way yesterday and will continue to do so in the coming days. In the short term, we are positive about the markets. However, longer term, we remain cautious due to deteriorating global macroeconomic conditions and high valuations. Therefore, we plan to book profits on our current purchases by the end of CY 2024. “Nifty bounced back sharply in the first half on Friday, re-tested the trendline, and made a new low on the hourly chart. However, a positive divergence is visible on the hourly chart. Incase of a pullback, the lower rising trendline which earlier provided support will now act as resistance and its level is 25250 currently. The 40HEMA at 25570, will be a major resistance level in the near term and a trend reversal level as well. On the way down, the low of 24750 is the next major support level.Cross currents on strong equity cues from Wall Street against rising triplets; USD index, crude and US 10 year yields may dominate trade set up for the upcoming week on Dalal Street.

Read more U.S. stocks rallied Friday on fresh signs of a strong labor market, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average ending at a record peak while the bond market cut back recession fears. U.S. stocks ended higher Friday after a stronger-than-expected jobs report, with all three major benchmarks picking up steam in late afternoon trading to end with weekly gains. For the week, the S&P 500 advanced 0.2%, while the Dow and Nasdaq each edged up 0.1%. All three major U.S. equities benchmarks booked a fourth straight week of gains. A stronger-than-expected jobs report underscored the resilience of the US economy and boosted soft-landing hopes. Treasuries sank as traders recalibrated their bets on the size of the Federal Reserve’s next rate cut. U.S. employers added 254,000 jobs in September, marking the quickest pace of hiring since March and exceeding economists’ forecasts of 150,000. The unemployment rate ticked down to 4.1% despite expectations for it to hold steady at 4.2%. A high-stakes corporate earnings season kicks into gear next week, with bullish investors hoping results will justify increasingly rich valuations in a U.S. stock market near record highs. Asian stocks rose after stronger-than-expected US payroll data underscored the health of the world’s largest economy and boosted optimism over a soft landing. Three central banks are set to release their interest rate decisions this week, namely the Bank of Korea, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand and the Reserve Bank of India. Nifty ended lower for the fifth consecutive session on October 4. It recorded its worst week in over two years amid rising tensions in the middle east. At close, Nifty was down 0.79% or 200.3 points at 25049.9. Nifty fell for the fifth consecutive session on Oct 04 forming a bear candle with a long upper shadow. This means that the upward retracement is happening in a running manner. Over the week, Nifty fell 4.45% retracing the gains of several weeks. This is a negative sign though oversold conditions may mean a small pullback in the near term. Nifty could now take support at 24753 and later 24420 while 25453 could act as a resistance in the near term. In the past week, panic-selling hit Dalal Street, pushing Nifty near the psychological 25,000 mark. However, a potential rebound is on the cards as Nifty bulls may regroup following a strong close on Wall Street after the US September Jobs Report eased recession fears. Key upcoming events include the FOMC Meeting Minutes and RBI MPC outcome on 9th October, and the US CPI data on 10th October. Traders should also watch crude oil prices, which have surged to $74.4 per barrel amid Middle East tensions.

The focus will be on the RBI monetary policy outcome and quarterly results of India Inc that will start trickling in from this week. Mandar Pitale, Head Treasury, SBM Bank India, said: The forthcoming Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting from October 7-9 will be conducted with the induction of three new MPC members in place of the retiring members. During the last meeting of MPC held in August, internal RBI members were biased towards an extended policy rate hold. “The September jobs report is hard proof that a soft landing is within the grasp of the Federal Reserve. Obviously, there is healthy momentum in the US labour market — US companies added 254,000 jobs when the projected increase was 150,000. Not just that, US unemployment has also ticked down to 4.1%, when economists expected that the unemployment rate would remain unchanged, or in fact, rise. The report also confirms that we will, most likely, conclude 2024 with two 25 bps cuts in November and December, without any big bang 50 bps rate cut. The jobs report would have strengthened the narrative for market bulls, had it not been for the widening Middle East conflicts. Now, with crude oil prices jumping by $3 a barrel, all eyes would be keenly glued to the fallouts of this geopolitical disturbance.” The market’s recovery faltered, with the Nifty closing at a 3-week low, managing to stay above 25,000. Selling pressure was widespread, and the overall market breadth favored declines. Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) are shifting funds away from India, viewing it as a relatively expensive market. Instead, they are turning to China, anticipating an economic revival there. This optimism was fueled by the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) cutting interest rates and lowering the reserve requirement ratio, alongside fiscal stimulus measures. These moves triggered a strong rally in both Chinese and Hong Kong markets, pushing up commodity prices. On the domestic front, the market’s focus will also be on the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), which is scheduled to meet from October 7 to 9, 2024, with the outcome to be announced on Wednesday, October 9. The RBI is expected to keep the benchmark repo rate unchanged in its upcoming policy review, having maintained it at 6.5% for the ninth consecutive meeting in August 2024. This aligns with market expectations, as the central bank aims to bring inflation closer to its medium-term target of 4% while supporting economic growth. The Q2 earnings season is kicking off with key companies like TCS, Tata Elxsi, DMart, and IREDA among others, which will drive stock-specific movements. Domestically, liquidity remains strong, with signs of sectoral rotation from overvalued segments to areas with more attractive valuations. Additionally, commodity prices, the U.S. dollar index, and key U.S. macroeconomic data will play a crucial role in determining market direction. Geopolitical developments will also continue to be a significant factor on the global front. Technically, the Nifty has the immediate and critical support level stands at 24,750, with the next support around the rising 100-day moving average (DMA) near the 24,400 mark. On the upside, 25,500 and 25,700 will act as key resistance levels during any potential pullback. While Banknifty, The 100-day moving average (DMA) at 51,100 serves as an immediate support level, with the 50,000-49,500 range, which aligns with the 200-DMA, acting as the next support zone. On the upside, 52,500 and 53,300 will be key resistance levels during any pullback. Bank of Maharashtra raised Rs 3,500 crore from QIP - allotted at Rs 57.36 against the floor price of Rs 60.37.

The recent US jobs data raised hopes for soft landing of the world’s largest economy and seems to have reduced the chances of another 50 bps rate cut by the end of this year. The US inflation continued to fall for fifth consecutive month, dropping to 2.5 percent in August, from 2.9 percent in July. Additionally, PPI and wholesale inventories data from the US, retail sales from Europe, household spending & PPI numbers from Japan, and vehicle sales from China will also be watched. 1) 8th results of Haryana and J& K 2) 9th RBI policy 3) 10th Result season start The Indian benchmark indices were knocked down badly last week. Nifty 50, Sensex and the Nifty Bank index tumbled over 4 per cent. Escalating tensions in the Middle East have been weighing on the Indian equities. Last week, we were bullish and had expected the benchmark indices to go up. That view has gone wrong. The sharp fall last week has turned the short-term picture weak. However, there is not threat for the broader uptrend. Although there is room to fall more from here, supports are coming up which can halt the fall and produce a bounce. The Reserve Bank of India’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) may prefer to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at their forthcoming meeting as the escalating Iran-Israel conflict could pose inflationary risks due to higher crude oil prices even as growth remains steady. After a wave of initial public offerings (IPOs) in recent weeks, the primary market will experience a brief slowdown, with only two new public issues scheduled for the next week, aiming to raise ₹365 crore.

A war of words broke out between Ola founder Bhavish Agarwal and stand-up comedian Kunal Kamra on Sunday on social media platform X over the after-sales and service quality of the company’s electric scooters. It started when Kamra responded to a post on X by Agarwal, who posted a photo of Ola’s gigafactory, by putting a picture of several Ola Electric scooters parked together seemingly waiting for servicing.

Analyst estimates suggest that tier-1 companies, or large-caps, are expected to witness revenue growth of 0.9-3 per cent q-o-q, while mid-caps are expected to grow by 2.1-4.5 per cent. Equipped with ₹17,600 crore fundraising and a zero-debt status, Anil Ambani’s Reliance Group companies — Reliance Infrastructure Ltd and Reliance Power Ltd — are poised to execute their growth strategies, according to officials. In the past two weeks, both companies have announced raising ₹4,500 crore through preferential issues of equity shares and ₹7,100 crore from global investment fund Varde Partners through equity-linked long-term FCCBs, having a long maturity period of 10 years and low interest rate of 5 per cent.

Title: Five talking points from the weekend GAA club championships
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/gaelic-games/2024/10/06/five-talking-points-from-the-weekend-gaa-club-championships/
Time Published: 2024-10-06T20:37:05Z
Full Content:
Kilmacud Crokes’ win over Na Fianna kept them on course for a club record fourth successive Dublin football title. They had to pedal hard in the second half, but the champions held on for a 1-12 to 0-12 victory – the decisive goal coming in first-half injury time from Mark O’Leary. Their final against Cuala is something of a neighbourhood squabble but the first time it has been played out at this level. Cuala’s defeat of Ballymun Kickhams on Saturday sent them to a first senior football final since 1988. Back-to-back All-Ireland hurling champions in 2017-18, the Dalkey club have yet to win the Dublin football title. This weekend’s semi-final success was spearheaded by recently confirmed football All Star nominee Con O’Callaghan, who started both All-Ireland club hurling finals and scored 0-8 in the 0-16 to 1-8 win over Ballymun. Southside football in the capital has strengthened considerably in the 36 years since Cuala’s last final. Of the 35 titles contested 18 have been won by clubs from south of the river and none of Thomas Davis, Kilmacud Crokes and Ballyboden St Enda’s had even won their first senior championship. Kilmacud could go clear second on the Dublin roll of honour if they win the final – despite having won the first of their 11 titles in 1992, 46 years after O’Toole’s won their 11th. Although the champions will be hot favourites a few in the club may remember how in 2009 when they reached the Dublin under-21 final against an unfancied Cuala it didn’t go to plan and the underdogs ran out 2-7 to 0-6 winners. The weekend’s two county football finals ended in draws and will go to replays. In Leitrim, Ballinamore Seán O’Heslin’s, winners three years ago, had nearly got home but champions Mohill rallied and replacement Matthew Murphy got a late equaliser. Carlow also featured recent champions – from 2022 and 2021 – in the meeting of Palatine and Rathvilly, and it took two late points from Liam Molloy and Liam Gavin to force a replay. Elsewhere “winner on the day” protocols led to great excitement and heartbreak in Clare where Sixmilebridge beat Inagh-Kilnamona to join Saturday’s victorious semi-finalists Feakle in the hurling final after extra time and penalties. The shoot-out went to a second round before David Fitzgerald’s penalty flew over the bar to send the Bridge through – a cruel sign-off to a brilliant season for Fitzgerald who nonetheless has an All-Ireland and League double under his belt. In the Cork football championship, which has provided a few shoot-outs in recent times, Nemo Rangers qualified for the semi-finals with a 5-4 penalty win over Clonakilty when extra time had failed to separate the teams. The vital kick fell to Ross Corkery, a son of former All Star Colin, and he did the needful. The Cork hurling semi-finals were contrasting events. Divisional side Imokilly had a comfortable nine-point win over Blackrock to reach a 10th final. The east Cork side have established quite a record since breaking through 27 years ago. Since then they have won five titles – two back-to-back and also a three-in-a-row – and lost just the one, in 2001, although they did lose three other finals before they won their first. That 1997 final is to be re-enacted this year as champions Sarsfields, their opponents back then, won their semi-final against Midleton, albeit without any measure of comfort. It looked as if Conor Lehane’s injury-time equaliser had forced extra time but up popped last year’s top gun Aaron Myers to decide the match 0-22 to 0-21. It has been part of the mythology of Kilkenny’s 20th century hurling domination that manager Brian Cody, who led the county to 11 All-Irelands, hadn’t been an obvious choice given his experiences in charge of home club James Stephens. In his autobiography Cody acknowledged as much. “In stark, blunt terms you could say that my years as The Village manager had been a failure – certainly when it came to winning trophies – so there was no obvious reason why county chairman John Healy or the rest of the board would look in my direction.” Since retiring after his record-breaking exploits with the county he has been back involved with the club but with no discernible lift in fortunes, having precipitously toppled in three years from losing a county final to being blitzed in last year’s semi-final and on Saturday being beaten in a relegation playoff by Glenmore after a difficult season. It will be a first campaign outside senior in 70 years. They weren’t the only former All-Ireland champions to find themselves on the downward escalator at the weekend. Galway’s Kiltormer, winners of the Tommy Moore in 1992, slipped into junior hurling for next year after losing a relegation playoff with Kilbeacanty. Both of the Mayo football semi-finals went to extra time before Ballina Stephenites saw off Ballaghaderreen and Knockmore came from behind to pip Breaffy. It will be the fifth year running that the local rivals will be in the county final but the first time that they have played each other in 20 years, Ballina coming out on top on that occasion. On Sunday Ballina emerged on top by 1-18 to 2-12, and had to survive a late goal chance for Shairoze Akram which was somehow scrambled to safety and they will contest a third successive final. Later there were times when Breaffy looked more likely winners but Knockmore refused to wilt. In extra time it appeared as if Pearse Ruttledge’s sending off had swung the match in Breaffy’s direction but they too lost a man when Conor Beirne also picked up a red card. Late goals in extra time from replacements Charlie Bourke and Billy Ruane settled the matter for a 2-15 to 0-18 victory.

Title: Ukrainian refugee families in south Dublin to be ‘uprooted’ and moved to hotels, claim supporters

Ukrainian refugee families living in Blackrock, south Dublin Ukrainian refugee families living in Blackrock, south Dublin, are to be “uprooted” and moved to hotels on Monday, supporters have claimed. Blackrock Supporters Group issued a media alert tonight stating the refugees will be moved to West Dublin hotels. The Irish Independent has asked the Department of Children if this report is accurate and for details. A spokesperson for the group said: “Supporters of the Blackrock Ukrainians were shocked that the Blackrock centre had been prioritised for closure. “They are vulnerable families and are in schools and jobs locally. To be moved now after two years to a remote, out of town hotel setting makes no sense. "The Ombudsman for Children has been clear that long term accommodation in hotels is damaging and inappropriate for children. “Hotels are also much more expensive than this self-catering model. Nothing about this closure makes sense.” The group has claimed the Department of Children and Integration will terminate its contract for Ukrainian refugee accommodation in Blackrock. They added that a “decision to close the state accommodation and relocate the vulnerable tenants has been unsuccessfully appealed by the impacted Ukrainian refugees, as well as the local community and representatives”. The group of 30 Ukrainians had been resident at the Blackrock property since December 2022, the group stated. They claimed the residents are “set to be moved to three different hotels and are advised that the new accommodation is temporary, and they can expect to be moved again”. The group added that it had been “highlighted in a written appeal that their lives will be put into complete turmoil if they are forced to relocate now after two years of settled life in Blackrock”. The Blackrock property has been “converted from commercial office use to emergency use, with up to 42 bedspaces and communal self-catering facilities,” the group stated, “The Ukrainians appealed as a group to the Department of Children and Integration to review the decision as their children are settled in schools and into the community,” it added. “The group learned of the closure on September 2 as schools reopened and have been supported by parents in local schools, as well as neighbours, to appeal to the Department to review the decision or delay the closure to allow them to find appropriate accommodation in the area,” the group said. Supporters and Ukrainians have joined together to now create the Blackrock Community Alliance to “help and representations have been made to the Minister for Children, Roderic O’Gorman and to local TDs and councillors,” the notification explained. A petition had been signed by 1,200 in the area and employers and schools had written letters of support. Join the Irish Independent WhatsApp channel Stay up to date with all the latest news

Title: Ukrainian families in South Dublin face relocation on Monday

Olha Sheremet’s husband Viktor has stomach cancer, meaning she must cook special food for him, she explains through a translation app while standing at the foot of a staircase in a building in Blackrock, Co Dublin. With tears streaming down her face, she moves her hand over her heart as she shows photographs of her son holding a gun while wearing a military uniform on the front line in Ukraine. She speaks to him once a month, she says. “We cannot live and cook in a hotel. Everything is nearby here, both the hospital and medical centre where my husband is being monitored. We are elderly people and it is very difficult for us to move,” the translation reads. She is one of 29 Ukrainians in a property in the south Dublin suburb of Blackrock who have been told that three buses will arrive on Monday morning to move them to new accommodation. Under plans drawn up by the Department of Integration, the group which has been living at the property since December 2022, is to be split up and moved to three separate hotels near Citywest, Liffey Valley and Temple Bar. [ Ukraine’s weariness with the West grows as war enters new phase: ‘People are tired, but we have no choice’Opens in new window ] The group varies in age with eight children attending schools in the area, five of whom are in primary schools, one in secondary and two at preschool. Living there for almost two years, they have become a “big family”, they say. Half of them are working nearby, in areas such as construction, caring, pharmacy and cleaning while others are in further education or learning English to use their qualifications in Dublin. “Everyone hopes and prays that something will be organised this week so we can stay long-term. It’s very important because we worked so hard to build our lives in this area,” says Diana Tkachuk, a 31-year-old from Sverdlovsk, who lives there with her six-year-old daughter Alisa. Sitting beside her, Natalia Mishchenko shows videos she took in March 2022, of the regional intensive care hospital of Mariupol, where she worked as a nurse, reduced to rubble. The 44-year-old is working in a local petrol station while studying to work as a nurse in the Republic. Her young daughter, Varvara, attends the same school as Alisa and plays camogie locally, she says. “All our lives are organised in this area,” says Ms Tkachuk, who works locally as a florist. “It’s very sad because we have to move out and live separately. I think for some people, it will be harder without support like English, it will be hard,” she says. She does not worry for herself, she adds, but for her daughter who will have to start over again, something that was challenging when they first arrived. “Everyone is upset, stressed and shocked,” she says. Ramziia Zidliaieva, a 66-year-old economist from Crimea, who lives at the property with her son Aider said she will not be boarding the bus on Monday morning, even if it means they will officially have nowhere to stay. “I want to stay here because I like this house and I like the very nice people. It’s very good, they’re beautiful people and they’re fighting for us. I’m very happy I have these people and this family and I thank god,” she says. The employer of Ms Zidliaieva’s son in Dún Laoghaire wrote to the department urging to reconsider the move which they described as “shocking”. Blackrock Community Alliance, a group of locals advocating for the Ukrainians, also urged the department not to proceed with the move. One letter from Carysfort National School said it has worked “tirelessly” to establish a sense of security for the families. It says children living at the property had “fully settled” within the local community, adding that the “proposed disruption would impact severely on these children’s emotional state”. The residents were initially informed on September 2nd, as the children were returning to school. The department explained it is consolidating its accommodation portfolio due to a reduction in the number of Ukrainians fleeing the war and seeking accommodation. [ ‘He called Ukraine his home’: frontline fighters recall Irish soldier Robert Deegan killed by Russian shellingOpens in new window ] A subsequent letter informed them of the buses due to arrive on Monday morning, adding that if they refuse the accommodation, they would not receive further offers, nor could they access the Citywest Transit Hub. “These actions are necessary to ensure the provision of accommodation for all who need it,” the letter reads. The residents wrote to the department asking it to reconsider or at least postpone the move until alternative arrangements could be made, either through private rented accommodation or host families, though no such pledges have yet been made. The majority are refusing to board the buses, hoping an agreement can be reached in the coming days. The owner of the property, who wished for their name and the precise location of the accommodation to remain anonymous, said the department declined a request for an extension to allow a planned transition to private accommodation in the area or at the current property. Applications for rent supplements in the hope of staying on as private tenants have also been declined by the Department of Social Protection as it deemed the property unsuitable for their needs. A spokesman for the Department of Integration said contracts are being ended regularly and that every effort is being made to keep those being moved, as local as possible. “The department appreciates that this is not easy for people and that moving location can be very disruptive, but at all times the department was clear that State-funded accommodation is temporary and subject to change,” he said.

Title: Terenure beat Lansdowne 28-22 in repeat of last season’s Division 1A semi-final

Terenure’s highly rated 19-year-old Austrian-born outhalf Casper Gabriel announced his arrival on the Energia All-Ireland League scene with a stunning cameo off the bench to help seal a 28-22 win over Lansdowne in a repeat of last season’s Division 1A semi-final. Terenure were leading 23-22 with 12 minutes to go when their two 19-year-old debutant halfbacks combined, Chris O’Connor moving the ball to the blindside off a back-pedalling scrum inside the home 10-metre line and Gabriel, with his second touch at AIL level, offloading outrageously to release Craig Adams. The left-winger exchanged passes with O’Connor before scoring and the win was effectively sealed when Lansdowne opted for a scrum from a penalty seven minutes out and 23-year-old prop Marcus Hanan, making his first appearance since Terenure won the AIL final two seasons ago after a neck operation, won a relieving penalty. The classy Lansdowne centre Andy Marks had scored two early tries to put Lansdowne 12-0 ahead, before Chris Cosgrave converted Adam La Grue’s try and landed two long-range penalties to put the home side 13-12 up at the break. An intercept try by Lansdowne’s debutant 19-year-old winger Todd Lawlor put them back in front but following another Cosgrave penalty Henry McErlean set up a try by lock David Maher. Cue the O’Connor-Gabriel cameo. Something also had to give at Temple Hill where the game was brought forward to 1.30pm before rain of biblical proportions arrived. By then Cork Con had eased into 20-0 interval lead through tries by ex-Sevens winger Seán French and scrumhalf Adam Maher. Matthew Bowen added a third, and James Taylor kicked the rest as they ended Young Munster’s unbeaten start with a 25-5 win. This left Clontarf alone atop 1A as they recorded a third bonus-point win away to UCD in what was a highly competitive affair until the visitors’ power game enabled them to pull away and win 30-15. City of Armagh played the sodden conditions better than Garryowen in earning a slightly surprising but deserved 13-6 win at Dooradoyle, while Ballynahinch had five tries by half-time to lead 31-7 before St Mary’s again rallied to return with two bonus points from a 36-33 defeat. Despite winning one match the newly-promoted St Mary’s sit fourth. Blackrock had a very significant 35-34 win at Ollie Campbell Park to end Old Belvedere’s unbeaten start, meaning Nenagh’s 22-22 draw against Old Wesley at nearby Energia Park leaves them as the only unbeaten side in 1B. Corinthians, Barnhall, Cashel and Instonians continue to set their rip-roaring pace in 2A. Each earned a third bonus-point win, the pick of them being Corinthians’ 63-23 win in Navan, where the talented Seán Naughton converted all nine tries, including a brace by fellow Ireland under-20 John Devine. In a reprise of last season’s women’s final Railway Union gained a measure of revenge with a 19-18 win over champions UL Bohs in a game that was moved to Annacotty as a penalty try and a try by Claire Boles sealed a 19-18 comeback win.

We recently compiled a list of the 35 AI Superstars According to Goldman Sachs. In this article, we are going to take a look at where ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) stands against the other AI superstars according to Goldman Sachs. US technology stocks have surged dramatically this year, largely driven by the growing excitement surrounding generative artificial intelligence (AI). However, according to research by investment firm Goldman Sachs, this rise is not indicative of a financial bubble like those of the past. The performance of these companies is expected to continue delivering solid returns to investors, fueled by the rise of AI superstars outside of the magnificent seven, among smaller tech firms and in non-tech sectors as well. However, Peter Oppenheimer, the bank's chief of global equity strategy and the head of macro research in Europe, has advised investors to diversify their portfolios to manage risk. While tech stocks have been dominant, contributing 32% of global equity returns and 40% of US equity returns since 2010, these returns are underpinned by strong financial fundamentals rather than speculative bubbles. The earnings per share for the tech sector have increased by 400% since the peak before the 2008 financial crisis, far outpacing other sectors, which collectively saw only a 25% increase. A key driver behind the outsized returns in recent years has been a small group of hyperscale companies, particularly those in software and cloud computing. These companies have leveraged their vast resources and high profitability to dominate the market, with recent performance surging even further due to optimism around AI. Read more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities. This has led to rising valuations, largely concentrated among a narrow group of market leaders. Peter Oppenheimer observes that this pattern mirrors historical trends in technological innovation. From the construction of canals in the 18th century to the adoption of the telephone, new technologies often attract vast capital and competition. Although this does not always result in financial bubbles, there is typically a period where prices decline as competition intensifies, ultimately leading to consolidation in the market. Over time, only a few large companies remain dominant, while growth shifts to secondary innovations that build on the original technology. The AI era is unique in that the dominant companies, which lead in AI, were also at the forefront of the previous tech wave — particularly in software and cloud services. Their scale and profitability have positioned them well to absorb the high costs of AI investments. However, Oppenheimer notes that new competitors are emerging. The number of AI patents skyrocketed to over 60,000 in 2022, up from around 8,000 just four years earlier, suggesting that AI is following the typical pattern of large-scale capital growth and competition. Oppenheimer also points out that the companies pioneering a new technology are not always the ones that will create the most value from it in the long run. For instance, during the internet boom, telecom companies received significant investment, yet it was companies like those in social media and ride-sharing that capitalized on the internet infrastructure and achieved the greatest success. Similarly, as AI evolves, new companies could emerge as the next wave of tech superstars, reshaping industries beyond the current giants. Let's now take a look at the list of 35 AI superstars that are on the major bank's radar. We compiled this list after consulting a report by the bank on the AI industry. These stocks are also popular among elite hedge funds and hedge fund sentiment is an important indicator that we pay a lot of attention to at Insider Monkey. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A technician in a clean room working on a semiconductor device, illuminated by the machines. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 81 ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) makes and sells advanced semiconductor equipment systems. The company focuses on making and selling lithography machines. These machines are essential for companies who want to manufacture smaller chips. The lithography machines use photolithography, a process in which a light source is used to expose circuit patterns from a photomask onto a semiconductor wafer. The latest technological advances in this segment allow chipmakers to continually increase the number of transistors on the same area of silicon, with lithography historically representing a meaningful portion of the cost of making cutting-edge chips that are faster and more efficient than previous models. Chipmakers require EUV lithography tools developed by ASML to continue past the 10-nanometer process node. Berenberg analyst Tammy Qiu recently lowered the price target on ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) stock to EUR 945 from EUR 1,100 and kept a Buy rating on the shares. Deutsche Bank analyst Robert Sanders also recently lowered the price target on ASML to EUR 950 from EUR 1,100 and kept a Buy rating on the shares. Overall ASML ranks 17th on our list of the AI superstars according to Goldman Sachs. While we acknowledge the potential of ASML as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than ASML but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

James Docherty. Photo: willowparkjuniorschool.ie Tributes have been paid to the principal of Willow Park School, attached to Blackrock College, Dublin, following his death. James Docherty was a well respected principal at the south Dublin junior school. On the school’s website a tribute reads: “We are heartbroken to share with you the news of the unexpected passing of our beloved and devoted Principal James. Our thoughts and love are with his loving wife and cherished family. “Words cannot express grief at times like this. James was the kindest of men and tried to solve everyone’s problems. James will forever have a massive place in the heart of Willow Park. May his journey ahead bring him peace.” Mr Docherty, originally from Scotland, is survived by a young family. He had been principal of Willow Park School for almost eight-and-a-half years. He held a masters in leadership and management at Trinity College Dublin and a BA in primary school teaching from the University of Glasgow, as well as a higher national diploma in assisting multilingual learners to integrate into mainstream education. An welcome address from Mr Docherty was still on the school’s website earlier today. It read: “A Willow education provides boys with a moral compass for life. Our motto Fides et Robur (meaning faith and strength) pervades Willow daily life, as our pupils prepare for the joys and challenges ahead.” He added that new parents would “come to understand that Willow Park is more than just a school”.

Highlights this week include Tesla's (TSLA) expected unveiling of its self-driving robotaxi at a Thursday event as well as the release of earnings reports from JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC) on Friday. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) for September comes as investors monitor inflation following the Federal Reserve’s recent interest rate cut. Minutes for the September Federal Reserve meeting will also provide insight into the central bank’s recent actions, while several Fed officials are scheduled to deliver remarks throughout the week. Data on wholesale inflation, consumer credit, and the federal trade deficit are also on the calendar. Monday, Oct. 7 Tuesday, Oct. 8 Wednesday, Oct. 9 Thursday, Oct. 10 Friday, Oct. 11 Tesla is expected to introduce its self-driving “robotaxi” at a Thursday event, where the company could provide more details about several of its products. After delaying the highly anticipated event from August, Tesla will likely show off the driverless vehicle, provide details on its costs, and possibly demonstrate the ride-sharing app used to hail the vehicle that might be called a “Cybercab,” analysts said. In addition to the robotaxi, Tesla could also provide updates on its Optimus Bot humanoid robot, self-driving software, and a low-cost version of its electric vehicle (EV). Also on Thursday, chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices will provide updates for its artificial intelligence (AI) products as it hosts its “Advancing AI” event, where its chief executive officer, Lisa Su, will deliver remarks. Investors get a look at the performance of the financial services industry of late as several big banks will report 2024 third-quarter earnings on Friday. Leading the way is JPMorgan Chase, reporting after its prior-quarter results beat analyst expectations on strong revenue from its investment banking services. Earnings for the country’s largest bank come after an executive last month lowered expectations for net interest income following the Federal Reserve’s move to lower interest rates. Wells Fargo reported a decline in net interest income in its second-quarter report, despite its results coming in ahead of analyst projections. BlackRock will deliver earnings after it reported a record $10.6 trillion in assets under management (AUM) in the prior quarter. Delta Air Lines’ report on Thursday will offer insight into the air carrier’s performance during the summer travel season, while soda maker PepsiCo will deliver its financials after scaling back its growth outlook amid mixed results in its previous quarter. Market watchers will get a look at whether inflation continued to decline in September with the Thursday release of CPI. With recent data showing that price increases continue to slow, market participants are looking to see if inflation continues to trend down toward the Federal Reserve’s target. Easing price pressures prompted the Fed to reduce its key federal funds rate in September, which influences borrowing costs across the economy. Updated inflation data could send signals about the next moves for the central bank. Throughout the week, investors will have an opportunity to hear individual Fed officials’ thoughts on interest rates and the economy. Federal Reserve Gov. Michelle Bowman’s remarks on Friday will come after the inflation report, while New York Fed President John Williams, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly, Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari, and St. Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem are also on the week's speaking calendar. The Fed will also release the minutes from its Sept. 17-18 meeting on Wednesday, providing another look at how monetary officials are viewing the current economy. Markets could move on other economic data releases this week, including consumer credit on Monday, jobless claims on Thursday, consumer sentiment and wholesale inflation figures from the producer price index (PPI) report on Friday.

Title: Ireland pay for passing up chances as hosts Canada extend winning streak

There was no disgrace in losing this WXV 1 clash but perhaps a pang or two of regret for Scott Bemand’s Ireland team as they produced a gutsy performance against the world number two ranked side, who extended their winning streak to six matches. The vast majority of the home side play their club rugby in the England Premiership or in France. Ireland head coach Bemand, speaking to RTÉ, said: “It shows where we are and where we’ve got to that we’re disappointed with the result. There was a bit of naivety where we copped two seven-pointers late in the first half but then we regroup and win the second half five-nil. “We’re sitting here disappointed that we didn’t execute more chances, that we didn’t execute when we got into their 22. We think we’ve left some points out there. I’m immensely proud of the girls. We came here and said we want to leave respected. “I think we’ve come some way to earning a bit more of that respect. But we quickly wanted to move through the gears and be in them games right at the death.” Canada were worthy winners on the basis that they took three try-scoring chances to Ireland’s one and might have managed more had they been a little more patient in possession. It should be acknowledged that Ireland’s spirit and fight in defence was a factor in them not conceding more points. A 15-minute spell before the interval was match-defining in terms of the outcome. Ireland lost props Linda Djougang and Niamh O’Dowd to yellow cards either side of a penalty try – it was 15 on 13 for 60 seconds at one point before Canada’s Alexandria Ellis was sent to the sin bin for a ruck offence – but did manage to briefly reduce the deficit through a penalty from outhalf Dannah O’Brien. The visitors conceded two further tries in a three-minute spell before the interval, the first from Claire Gallagher while Ireland were still a player down, and the second when a Shoshanah Seumanutafa turnover at a ruck enabled Canadian blindside flanker Julia Omokhuale to race over from 30 metres unopposed. Centre Alex Tessier, who struck the ball beautifully off the tee, landed both conversions to nudge the Canada into a 21-3 interval lead. That scoreboard dominance would have had a harsh look to it from an Irish perspective as they were arguably the better side for the majority of the first quarter but could not translate that pressure into points. Both sides elected to kick for territory early on and the visitors had particular reason to be grateful to Erin King, the Irish blindside nicking a lineout and then forcing a ruck penalty to thwart mounting Canadian pressure. Ireland also had one or two lineout issues which cost them a decent platform. Brittany Hogan made a couple of trademark bursts, while on the other side of the ball Stacey Flood’s tackle on Tessier and turnover not only snuffed out a Canadian attack but allowed O’Brien to push Ireland back into Canadian territory with a superb kick. Djougang was binned for a deliberate knock down, O’Dowd for collapsing a maul, both close to the line. Aoife Wafer provided a brief respite from the Canadian dominance with a typical charge through defenders before she linked with captain Enya Breen. O’Brien kicked the resultant penalty as Ellis was sent to the sin bin for not rolling away. Ireland needed the first score after the interval and got it thanks initially to another outstanding Wafer carry, in which she occupied five defenders. Dorothy Wall carried into contact before O’Brien’s inch-perfect crosskick was caught and dotted down by Eimear Considine. It was to be the final score of the match. Prop Andrea Stock made her Ireland debut off the bench and Deirbhile Nic a Bháird was summoned for a first Irish appearance following an ACL injury. A spiralling error-rate, with Ireland penalised for some maul transgressions, meant that neither side were able to sustain pressure for long enough to create and finish try-scoring opportunities. Nicole Fowley’s right foot earned territory for Ireland but Canada had their moments too, and it took a brilliant tackle from Emily Lane to cut down Laetitia Royer and prevent the home side from increasing their lead. Ireland will play their final game in the tournament against USA next Friday night (8.30pm Irish time). SCORING SEQUENCE – 24 mins: penalty try, 7-0; 32: O’Brien penalty, 7-3; 33: Gallagher try, Tessier con, 14-3; 36: Omokhuale try, Tessier con, 21-3. Half-time: 21-3. 45: Considine try, 21-8.

Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run A bronze statue depicting Satoshi Nakamoto, the mysterious creator of bitcoin, was unveiled in ... [+] Hungary in 2021 amid a bitcoin price boom that his unmasking threatens to destroy. A new HBO documentary titled Money Electric: The Bitcoin Mystery is set to air on Tuesday at 9pm ET, with producers claiming to have cracked the mystery of bitcoin's anonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto, it was this week reported by Politico. In an email, a publicist drumming up press for the film claimed it will "present a compelling case for who Satoshi Nakamoto may be" without going so far as to claim any sort of proof of Satoshi Nakamoto's true identity or new evidence. Interest in Satoshi Nakamoto's identity has increased along with the value of the 1.1 million bitcoin the anonymous man, woman or group is believed to control, now worth around $66 billion at current prices. Speculators on the Polymarket betting platform think it's most likely that Len Sassaman, a cypherpunk who took his own life in 2011, will be named as Satoshi by the HBO documentary, attracting 38% of punters. However, Twitter posts written by Sassaman from bitcoin's earliest days show he was unimpressed by the technology. "Personally, I think bitcoin is overhyped, but the hype itself is interesting," Sassaman posted, adding in a separate post that "digital cash experts I've talked to [say] that it's bunk." Other names tipped as possibilities include Hal Finney, who received the first bitcoin transaction before he died in 2014, bit gold developer Nick Szabo and Blockstream chief executive Adam Back. However, the prediction market site is also putting a 90% likelihood of Satoshi's identity not being proven in 2024. Adding the excitement, early bitcoin wallets from the Satoshi era—when they were still posting on the BitcoinTalk forum—have recently woken up and begun moving coins, it was recently reported by Bitcoin Magazine. Some 250 bitcoin worth around $15 million have been moved from wallets over the last two weeks. If any of the bitcoin believed to be directly linked to wallets used by Satoshi Nakamoto is moved, it's expected to trigger a market crash as traders scramble to sell ahead of what could be a tsunami of bitcoin flooding the market.

U.S. cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase warned ahead of its 2021 Nasdaq market debut that the unmasking of Satoshi Nakamoto is a major risk to its business. "The identification of Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous person or persons who developed bitcoin, or the transfer of Satoshi’s bitcoins" is a risk factor, the company’s prospectus read. Meanwhile, new research carried out by X user Wicked has suggested Satoshi Nakamoto conducted a 51% mining attack on the bitcoin network in its first year of existence, ostensibly to test what would happen if a single miner gained full control. A 51% attack involves a bitcoin miner gaining majority control of the bitcoin network by "out hashing" other miners with sheer computational power. If a miner is able to do so, they would be able to reorder the network, triggering a likely fatal crisis of confidence. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

Title: Top 5 things to watch in markets in the week ahead

Investing.com -- This week’s U.S. inflation data for September will be keenly anticipated after Friday’s stronger than expected jobs report reassured investors who had been concerned that the economy was weakening. The Federal Reserve is to publish the minutes of its September meeting, earnings season gets underway, and oil prices look set to remain volatile amid heightened geopolitical tensions. Here's your look at what's happening in markets for the week ahead. Thursday’s inflation data for September is expected to show that price pressures continued to moderate at the end of the third quarter. The data, coming on the heels of Friday’s robust jobs report is likely to shape expectations around the size and pace of Fed rate cuts in the coming months. Producer price inflation data on Friday is also expected to point to tamer inflation. The data is likely to reassure the Fed that inflation is on a sustainable path back towards its 2% target. The Fed kicked off its easing cycle last month with a hefty 50 basis point rate cut and Friday’s jobs report argues against the central bank delivering another outsize cut in November. “Next week, CPI for September will be a key data release. If prices rise faster than expected on top of the stronger labor data, chances for the Fed to skip the November meeting will increase,” analysts at UBS said in a note on Friday. “Keep in mind that in the "dot plot" released following the September FOMC meeting, nearly half of the participants thought that total cuts of 50-75 bps by year-end would be appropriate, meaning only 0-25 bps of additional cuts this year.” The Fed is to publish the minutes of its September meeting on Wednesday with investors on the lookout for indications into how officials may be thinking about the pace of easing going forward. Additional insights into the factors that led to policymakers reaching a consensus around the 50bps cut would also be noteworthy. Investors will also get a chance to hear from several Fed officials during the coming week, including Neel Kashkari, Raphael Bostic, Adriana Kugler and Lorie Logan. Meanwhile, Thursday’s report on initial jobless claims is likely to be impacted by recent weather disruptions. U.S. third-quarter earnings season is about to kick into gear, in what will be a test for a stock market near record highs and trading at lofty valuations. Major financial firms including JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) and BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) all report on Friday. Bank results offer an important view into the economy, including the strength of demand for loans. Investors will also be on the lookout for signs of whether the Fed’s large rate cut last month is already influencing the economy through rising auto sales or the purchase of other big-ticket items. Other companies reporting results during the week include PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL). Bullish investors are hoping results will justify increasingly rich valuations in the stock market. The S&P 500 is up 20% for the year so far and is trading near record highs despite recent volatility spurred by rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. Oil prices rose on Friday and settled with their biggest weekly gains in over a year on the mounting threat of a region-wide war in the Middle East, although gains were limited as U.S. President Joe Biden discouraged Israel from targeting Iranian oil facilities. Israel has sworn to strike Iran for launching a barrage of missiles at Israel last Tuesday after Israel assassinated the leader of Iran-backed Hezbollah. The events had oil analysts warning clients of the potential ramifications of a broader war in the Middle East. On a weekly basis, Brent crude gained over 8%, the most in a week since January 2023. WTI gained 9.1% week-over-week, the most since March 2023. Iran is a member of OPEC+ with production of around 3.2 million barrels per day or 3% of global output. The group's spare production capacity should allow other members to boost output if Iranian supplies are disrupted, limiting oil price gains. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand meets on Wednesday and some market watchers believe it could follow the Fed's example and cut rates by half a point. The central bank lowered the official cash rate for the first time in more than four years at its last meeting in August, a year ahead of its own projections, and RBNZ Governor Adrian Orr said he would like to deliver two more cuts by Christmas. Meanwhile, the Reserve Bank of Australia is to publish the minutes of its September meeting on Tuesday, with market watchers on the lookout for insights on its hawkish hold. RBA Deputy Governor Andrew Hauser on the docket to speak the same day. --Reuters contributed reporting

Title: Sorry, Not Sorry: Hillary Clinton Is Still Waiting for Your Apology

Hillary Clinton isn't going anywhere. Why would she? She was right. She tried to warn us. She was treated so unfairly. She deserved it; we betrayed her. We were sexist. We were duped. She was robbed. Putin, Comey, Facebook, Electoral College. The goddamned voters, man. Sorry? She's not sorry. She's still waiting for an apology from you. From all of us. If you're normal, you probably had no idea Hillary was on tour again after writing an angsty post-career memoir, her second in the category. Nevertheless, she persists. It's called Something Lost, Something Gained: Reflections on Life, Love, and Liberty. Naturally, it was written in collaboration with the Evergreen Strategy Group, a woke consulting firm founded by former Clinton aides that helps clients such as Nike and BlackRock "live their values with confidence and compassion." We all know what Hillary lost. For crying out loud, she hosted a "victory" party under a giant glass ceiling on Election Night in 2016. Her campaign ordered a bunch of confetti cannons to blast symbolic shards into the air. She made her goon John Podesta go out and tell everyone to go home after she lost. "We're still counting votes," he sobbed. That was eight years ago. So, what has she gained since then? Ever the politician—ever the Clinton—she knows what she's supposed to say, so that's what she says. Even if it isn't true. Which it's not. Hillary, who turns 77 later this month, would like us to believe she's gained wisdom, perspective, acceptance, humility, all that shit. She's excited about getting older, ready to "fearlessly embrace" physical decline. Could it be that she's lying? That would be more in line with her character. It would also explain why the Annie Leibovitz cover photo is touched up beyond all recognition. All this time after venting her postelection feelings in What Happened, Hillary is determined to prove she's not done venting her feelings. She is Uncle Rico from Napoleon Dynamite, still harping on about the high school state championship she would have won if coach had put her in the game in the fourth quarter. About the country she alone could have saved. She "flew on Air Force One, dined with kings and queens, and was constantly surrounded by armed guards." She coulda been a contender. As if anyone cares, which they don't, Hillary lauds herself as "the first woman to win a presidential primary, the nomination of a major party, and the national popular vote." Hell, even her MSNBC fans must be getting tired of her by now. (The ones who haven't died yet.) "These days, I find myself thinking mostly about the future," Hillary bluffs as she relitigates old grievances. "Time and so many battles won and lost have given me a thicker skin and a stiffer spine." How she really feels is revealed in the text. Her "pang of vindication" when Trump was convicted of paying hush money to a porn star. "A fraud was committed against the American people, against all of us," she bristles. "I would have won. ... Even now, just thinking about that moment makes fury well up in my chest." She's owed an apology, dammit, even if we don't deserve her forgiveness just yet. It's probably made up, but Hillary claims to have been approached by a groveling FBI dude eager to apologize for the bureau's "devastating and unfair" investigation (her words) into her emails. She was not in the mood. "I stared at him for a minute, trying to contain my anger," she fumes. "You're sorry? Now? Finally, I said, 'I would have been a great president,' and walked away." These little nuggets are like porn but for the sick freaks who bought Robert Mueller prayer candles and waited in line to take selfies with Elizabeth Warren. Your weird aunt who went a little too far with the "Anthony Fauci, sex god" stuff. Bless her heart, Hillary. At one point, she likens herself to Cassandra, a virgin princess from Greek mythology described as having "bulky breasts, small feet" and a "shortish, round-faced, white, mannish figure." Cassandra could see the future, but was cursed to be ignored. By the Trojans, for example, who dismissed her warnings about Greek invaders hiding in a wooden horse. "I take no pleasure in being right. In fact, I hate it," Hillary seethes. "I tried to raise the alarm [about Trump] in every way I could, but the media and many in the political establishment dismissed me as overwrought, even hysterical." Because the Trojans didn't listen, Cassandra was captured and forced into sex slavery. Because the voters didn't listen to Hillary, a similar fate befell America. It's about to happen again, so don't say she didn't warn you. In the chapter "Remaining Awake Through a Coup," Hillary unveils her deranged fantasy of a second Trump term. She envisions "soldiers patrolling streets" alongside "roving deportation squads." Immigrants rounded up in "massive, sweltering camps." Trump has declared war on Mexico. Putin has conquered Ukraine. Smog blankets the sky. Crops rot in the fields. Trump's enemies rot in prison alongside the women and doctors who ran afoul of his pregnancy monitors. Dumpsters overflow with unwanted babies. "I wish the imagined future I've sketched out were just a liberal fever dream, some kind of dystopian MSNBC fan fiction," Hillary bemoans. "But it's not." (It is. Overwrought, even hysterical, one could say.) This coming from the same failed politician who wants us to "work together to restitch our unraveling social fabric and to rebuild Americans' trust in one another." Uniquely ill-suited to the task, she is. Completely oblivious, as well, when preaching against "viewing the other party as traitors, criminals, or otherwise illegitimate," having done precisely that throughout the book. "Soon enough, actual blood gets spilled." (Um, it already has.) Bullshit aside, Hillary relays a cute anecdote about "an editor at a major newspaper" who reached out in 2022 to ask if she'd write an op-ed about "how prescient" she was to denounce Trump supporters as "deplorables." The media can be so unfair. When she's not moping about being right, Hillary tries to convince us she doesn't spend all her time obsessing about politics. That she's fun! You can imagine how persuasive this is. Several chapters recount good times hanging out with old friends who know her as "Big Girl," and her "postmenopausal belly" as "Beulah." (Don't ask.) The girls weekend at the Franklin D. Roosevelt library watching "a film on the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II" sounds like a hoot. Ditto the "fun" story about the time her long-suffering bag servant Huma Abedin struggled to open the "fancy rhinestone-cheetah clasp" on her purse. Even a nice memory about shampooing her hair in the lake with childhood friends is instantly ruined. "I shudder now to think of the environmental implications," she moans. Hillary says her editorial consultant wanted the book to "feel like sitting with me at a dinner party." (Like hell, apparently.) Considering the intestinal fortitude required to make it to the end, I'd say mission accomplished.

Last week closed on a positive note, with two key developments easing concerns about the economy. A strong jobs report helped calm fears of a weakening labor market, while the resolution of the dockworkers’ strike alleviated worries about supply chain disruptions. In addition, oil prices, which had surged early in the week due to Middle East tensions, saw a welcome pullback by the weekend. This week promises to be action-packed, with plenty on the horizon. With this wave of optimism, let’s dive into what the coming week has in store. NVIDIA’s AI Summit kicks off Monday, running from Oct. 7-9 in Washington, D.C. The three-day event will bring together industry leaders to explore how AI can tackle some of society’s biggest challenges. With a focus on healthcare, cybersecurity, manufacturing, and more, the summit will highlight AI’s potential to drive innovation across key sectors. Amazon’s (AMZN) highly anticipated two-day Prime Day sale event kicks off Tuesday, offering a valuable glimpse into consumer behavior and e-commerce trends. The sale will provide key insights into what products shoppers are prioritizing, as well as into the broader state of consumer demand. This event is expected to highlight popular categories and pricing strategies and could serve as a bellwether for the coming holiday shopping season. Amazon’s recruitment strategy is partly driven by expectations that e-commerce spending will surpass overall holiday sales in the fourth quarter. The company’s Prime Day event earlier this year generated over $14.2 billion in online sales, marking one of the biggest e-commerce events of the year. Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk will finally unveil the highly anticipated Robotaxi on Thursday at Warner Bros. Studios (WBD) in Los Angeles, California. Dubbed “We, Robot,” the event will show the first look at the prototype and the booking platform for owners and riders. There will be also an update to the company’s Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology, which powers the robotaxis, along with a production timeline and the service launch date. PepsiCo (PEP) is set to report its earnings ahead of the closing bell Tuesday. Then, Thursday, Delta Air Lines (DAL), Infosys (INFY), and Domino’s Pizza (DPZ) are scheduled to release their earnings before the market opens. The week will close with major banks taking center stage Friday, as JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC), BlackRock (BLK), and the BNY Mellon (BK) lead off the quarterly earnings season for the financial sector. The Consumer Credit report for September is set to be released Monday. Midweek (on Wednesday), investors will keep an eye on the Wholesale Inventories data for August, along with the minutes from the Federal Reserve’s September FOMC meeting, which could provide insights into the central bank’s next moves. Thursday will bring a trio of key data releases, including initial jobless claims, the consumer price index (CPI), and core CPI, offering a detailed look at inflation and labor market trends. Finally, on Friday, the producer price index (PPI) and core PPI will be released alongside preliminary consumer sentiment data for October, rounding out the week with a comprehensive view of inflationary pressures and consumer outlooks. – Francisco Velasquez contributed to this article Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Western North Carolina has world’s richest lithium, purest quartz deposits: Is Hurricane Helene a land grab by DOD to steal these valuable resources?

Some analysts say there was unusual atmospheric activity during Helene's track that appears to have produced such a high voltage that something was able to "push" it towards the areas that got hit the hardest. The reason could have to do with all those valuable minerals. "We have the richest deposit of lithium in North Carolina," reported 100percentfedup.com. "We have a top producer of lithium, Albemarle, getting a $90 million contract from the Department of Defense to create a lithium mine. Guess who has 12 million shares of Albemarle? BlackRock." Keep in mind that before Helene hit, many local residents were protesting against the creation of lithium mines in their area. Now, many of those same people's homes and livelihoods are destroyed and Albemarle and competitors like Piedmont Lithium, presumably, now have access to exactly what they want without the citizen protests. Albemarle, by the way, received a $90 million grant from the DOD to advance its domestic mining operations â operations that locals throughout western North Carolina do not want in their now-destroyed backyards. "Something doesn't smell right," 100percentfedup.com noted. "Are we seeing a similar tactic that was used in Hawaii for a land grab? Lahaina, Maui 2.0?" ?? Was Hurricane Heleneâs Path & Behavior a Result of Natural Processes or was It Manipulated?

(@PoisonDeathShot) September 30, 2024 (Related: Much of western North Carolina is now isolated from the rest of the world due to blocked and destroyed roads and damaged energy infrastructure.) High-purity quartz facilities in Spruce Pine shut down indefinitely Another valuable mineral that is only found in the mountains of western North Carolina â and specifically in Spruce Pine â is high-purity quartz, a mineral that is critical for the manufacture of semiconductors, solar panels and fiber-optic cables. According to reports, two facilities that mine and produce high-purity quartz, Sibelco and The Quartz Corp, are both closed indefinitely due to extensive damage caused by Hurricane Helene. Just last year, Sibelco announced a $200 million investment to double the capacity of its high-purity quartz mining and production operation. That investment is now on the rocks because of what Hurricane Helene did to the area. All of the company's employees are safe and accounted for, according to a statement. Previously, some of them were "unreachable due to ongoing power outages and communication challenges." "Please rest assured that Sibelco is actively collaborating with government agencies and third-party rescue and recovery operations to mitigate the impact of this event and to resume operations as soon as possible," the company said. Between the loss of high-purity quartz production and these issues with lithium companies trying to barge their way into communities of western North Carolina that do not want them, it sure does appear as though there is much more than meets the eye pertaining to Hurricane Helene. It is nothing short of strange, to say the least, that the Biden regime has really been ramping up its efforts to create a battery supply chain here in the U.S. to support its electric vehicle (EV) pipe dreams. "October surprise," one person wrote about the devastation. "More to come, I'm sure," responded another. The powers that be (TPTB) have apparently amassed so much power that they no longer care if the public knows about their greedy scamming operations designed to steal land and resources away from We the People.

High-purity quartz facilities in Spruce Pine shut down indefinitely Another valuable mineral that is only found in the mountains of western North Carolina â and specifically in Spruce Pine â is high-purity quartz, a mineral that is critical for the manufacture of semiconductors, solar panels and fiber-optic cables. According to reports, two facilities that mine and produce high-purity quartz, Sibelco and The Quartz Corp, are both closed indefinitely due to extensive damage caused by Hurricane Helene. Just last year, Sibelco announced a $200 million investment to double the capacity of its high-purity quartz mining and production operation. That investment is now on the rocks because of what Hurricane Helene did to the area. All of the company's employees are safe and accounted for, according to a statement. Previously, some of them were "unreachable due to ongoing power outages and communication challenges." "Please rest assured that Sibelco is actively collaborating with government agencies and third-party rescue and recovery operations to mitigate the impact of this event and to resume operations as soon as possible," the company said. Between the loss of high-purity quartz production and these issues with lithium companies trying to barge their way into communities of western North Carolina that do not want them, it sure does appear as though there is much more than meets the eye pertaining to Hurricane Helene. It is nothing short of strange, to say the least, that the Biden regime has really been ramping up its efforts to create a battery supply chain here in the U.S. to support its electric vehicle (EV) pipe dreams. "October surprise," one person wrote about the devastation. "More to come, I'm sure," responded another. The powers that be (TPTB) have apparently amassed so much power that they no longer care if the public knows about their greedy scamming operations designed to steal land and resources away from We the People.

Sources for this article include: 100percentfedup.com NaturalNews.com APNews.com Keep in mind that before Helene hit, many local residents were protesting against the creation of lithium mines in their area. Now, many of those same people's homes and livelihoods are destroyed and Albemarle and competitors like Piedmont Lithium, presumably, now have access to exactly what they want without the citizen protests. Albemarle, by the way, received a $90 million grant from the DOD to advance its domestic mining operations â operations that locals throughout western North Carolina do not want in their now-destroyed backyards.

We recently compiled a list of the 10 Buzzing AI Health Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) stands against the other buzzing AI health stocks. The economic impact of AI is projected to be substantial, particularly in regions like China and North America, which are expected to see GDP boosts of 26% and 14.5%, respectively, by 2030, amounting to $10.7 trillion combined. This surge is mirrored in the healthcare sector, where AI is driving transformative growth. According to SNS Insider, the Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare Market, valued at USD 22.5 billion in 2023, is forecasted to reach a staggering USD 370.14 billion by 2032, expanding at an impressive CAGR of 36.5% from 2024 to 2032. This explosive growth underscores the growing role of AI in revolutionizing healthcare through innovations in diagnostics, treatment, and operational efficiency. The World Economic Forum also points out that AI's potential in healthcare is particularly promising, given the global shortage of healthcare professionals, projected to reach 10 million by 2030. AI can alleviate the strain by automating routine tasks, reducing physicians' administrative workloads, and enabling earlier and more accurate diagnoses. This has sparked strong investment from both public and private sectors globally, making AI a key technology in the future of healthcare finance. Read more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave. AI's integration into healthcare is set to not only drive efficiency but also improve patient outcomes through more precise diagnostics and personalized treatment. Companies have responded by heavily investing in AI R&D, and mergers and acquisitions have accelerated the pace of innovation. As healthcare increasingly embraces AI, experts emphasize the potential for even greater transformations. According to Andrew Ng, a pioneer in AI research, "AI will fundamentally shift the healthcare landscape, enhancing diagnostic accuracy and optimizing patient care while reducing costs." Read more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and AI News You Should Not Have Missed. Our Methodology For this article, we selected trending health stocks that have AI products driving meaningful revenue gains. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). An operating room with a doctor monitoring a patient's vital signs during surgery with a medical device. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 69 Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) makes and sells healthcare products. The firm has embraced AI in diagnostics, particularly in its Alinity and FreeStyle Libre systems. The company uses AI to improve the accuracy of its continuous glucose monitoring systems and to enhance its diagnostics platforms. These AI-driven tools help healthcare providers make more informed decisions, improving patient outcomes and reducing the burden on healthcare systems. In terms of financial performance, Abbott reported $43.1 billion in revenue for 2023, up 7% from $40.3 billion in 2022. The growth was primarily driven by increased demand for its AI-powered diagnostics tools, particularly in the diabetes care segment, where the FreeStyle Libre system saw a 12% increase in sales. Abbott's continuous investment in AI is expected to contribute to sustained revenue growth as demand for accurate diagnostics rises. Overall ABT ranks 4th on our list of the buzzing AI health stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of ABT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than ABT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) Positioned for Growth in Gen-AI Training, Bernstein Analysts Highlight Inference Challenges for Competitors

We recently compiled a list of the 30 AI News Investors Should Not Miss. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other AI stocks. Artificial intelligence (AI) data centers are one of the hottest topics on Wall Street as companies across the industrial spectrum compete in a race to deploy AI technologies in their operations. The latest update comes from data center company Equinix, which recently announced that it would be forming a joint venture with GIC, a Singapore-based sovereign wealth fund, and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, to raise more than $15 billion in capital. Per the data center company, the capital would be used to expand the US footprint of hyperscale data centers. Hyperscale data centers are the largest in the industry, typically developed by technology giants based in the US, and offer massive networking capacity and often consume as much power as a big city or even a small country. Read more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave. As technology stocks stage a comeback on the back of Fed rate cuts and AI optimism, the news coming from the commerce department in the US has buoyed investors further. The US government said earlier this week that it plans to award nearly $100 million to boost the use of artificial intelligence in developing new sustainable semiconductor materials. The funding is part of the more than $52 billion in US chip manufacturing and research grants promised by US President Joe Biden. The latest funding would go towards helping universities, national laboratories, and the private sector develop AI-powered autonomous experimentation for sustainable semiconductor manufacturing. The goal is to reduce time needed to develop new semiconductor materials that are less resource-intensive.

A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 179 NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides graphics, computing and networking solutions. Bernstein analysts, led by Toni Sacconaghi, recently penned an investor note on the AI space, noting that the potential for continued strong Gen-AI training dynamics was likely constructive for NVIDIA at this point, though questions around the pace and trajectory of Gen-AI inference, however, may come more at the expense of their peers who have broadly acknowledged NVIDIA's training dominance and have hence focused on inference as the bulk of their long-term opportunity. Per Bernstein, leading LLM builders were already pre-buying NVIDIA's Blackwell to prepare for next-generation models. Overall NVDA ranks 5th on our list of the AI stocks investors should not miss. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.
