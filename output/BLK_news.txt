Early on in The Emerald Evertonian, a new book about the life and times of Peter Farrell, comes a remarkable detail revealing something of the status of soccer in 1930s Ireland. The young Farrell had just joined Cabinteely United, then run by an enthusiast called Christy Devlin. “The team’s ‘pavilion’,” writes author Rob Sawyer, “was a huge tree . . .” The tree was behind one goalmouth and under its branches, the players changed and deposited any valuables a 13 year-old from south Dublin might possess. Farrell saw the difference when he played Gaelic football “on much better grounds than our soccer one at Cabinteely”. He added: “We also had a well-equipped pavilion with showers at our school sports ground at Dún Laoghaire.” But Farrell was inspired, not dismayed. Even though Devlin earned little as a gravedigger, he and his wife would feed “several” boys before matches. Farrell took it all in. Early on in The Offside King, a new book about the life and times of Bill McCracken, comes his verdict on arriving at Newcastle train station at 3am, having just been transferred from Distillery. He was be met by three Newcastle United directors in “old-fashioned frock coats... I c...uldn’t help saying to myself ‘Begarra – they look more like undertakers’.” McCracken was dismayed, not inspired. But he endured his first unhappy months at St James’ Park and went on to become “a true legend of the game“, in the words of author Paul Joannou. Irish football, gravediggers and undertakers, there’s a joke in there. Farrell, from Dublin, and McCracken, from Belfast, were serious men, though. They were rich with connections great and small and these two books help build out our knowledge of who and what Irish football was and how we are where we are. This is social history as well as the charting of two fascinating football lives. Peter Farrell, for example, married Mabel Carney, whose aunt Winnie was the Winifred Carney alongside James Connolly at the GPO in 1916. The scent of independence may also have been in Farrell’s nostrils when he played in the first Ireland (FAI) international after the second World War. It was June, 1946, in Lisbon against Portugal and Farrell was made captain, even though it was his debut. That must have been some moment. Afterwards, back in Dublin at a ceremony at the Gresham hotel, he was presented with this first cap. Rather than hold on to it, maybe frame it, Farrell instead gave it to his guest at the Gresham – Christy Devlin. The big tree at Cabinteely had not been forgotten. Untold numbers of Irish soccer volunteers – and those who benefited – will recognise this reciprocal commitment and affection. In the 1910 FA Cup final replay, held at Goodison Park, McCracken was part of a Newcastle United side winning the trophy for the first time. McCracken was the penalty-taker and at 1-0 up, Newcastle were awarded one. But McCracken knew centre forward Albert Shepherd had been the subject of bribery gossip before the semi-final and was not selected. Shepherd was reinstated for the final and scored the opening goal. As McCracken passed him for the penalty, he said to Shepherd: “Fancy it? Go on, take it.” McCracken’s motivation was “to get him re-established”. Shepherd scored and entered the history books as the first player ever to score a penalty in an FA Cup final. Really, it should be McCracken. Thirty-nine years later there was another penalty in a 2-0 win at Goodison. It was England v Ireland (FAI) and Con Martin scored the spot-kick. Farrell scored the second as Ireland became the first “foreign” nation to beat England on English soil. Farrell was an Everton player by then, winning the 10th of 28 caps. He had passed through Shamrock Rovers, under the supervision of Jimmy Dunne, and won a tennis tournament in Blackrock. A dual international, he made the last of his seven Ireland (IFA) appearances six months earlier. McCracken played for Ireland (IFA), but only 16 times due to a row over pay. The blazers in Belfast barred him from selection for 11 years. Bureaucrats and Irish football. This was when McCracken was at his peak, but in asking for equal pay with English and Scottish internationals, he was deemed a troublemaker. The IFA ban extended to Irish League clubs and given there was no Border then, McCracken was effectively banned from setting foot on an a pitch anywhere in Ireland. Simultaneously, he was becoming the most talked-about footballer in England. Working in a Tyneside munitions factory during the first World War, McCracken was known for his prominent role in fundraising friendlies. It was a bit different from his reputation as a defender – ‘The Most Hated Man in Football’ was one headline. That attitude stemmed from his offside capabilities. McCracken was so efficient at offside that ‘McCrackenism’ became a term. In 1925, Law 6 of the game was changed from having three players between an attacker and goal to be onside, to two. The man from Nansen Street off the Falls Road changed the geometry of football forever. McCracken played 432 times for Newcastle United – Shay Given is one of only four players to have more appearances. Farrell played 452 times for Everton – only four men have made more league appearances for the club. Both went into management after playing, McCracken with Hull City, Gateshead, Millwall and Aldershot, Farrell with Tranmere Rovers, where his great friend and Evertonian Tommy Eglington played. Success, and failure, for both men is seen in context – neither were managing clubs with big budgets. McCracken returned to the Irish League as a Newcastle scout to sign George Eastham from Ards, then as a Watford scout to sign Pat Jennings from Newry Town. Farrell went briefly to the League of Ireland, playing three games for Sligo Rovers. It means he, Dixie Dean and Séamus Coleman, who writes the book’s foreword, are three men to have played for Everton and Sligo. Farrell went back to Britain – to Holyhead Town in Wales – then returned to Ireland for good. He managed Drogheda United briefly, then St Pat’s and TEK United. There he came to know another Devlin – Pat. Like all who came into contact with Farrell, Pat Devlin says he felt honoured to know the man. Lest anyone think this esteem is exaggerated, walk down Farrell Close in Kirkby in Liverpool, the street named after him. McCracken has less formal recognition, although his central role in changing a key law of the game will be reasserted by The Offside King, just as The Emerald Evertonian illustrates the significance of Peter Farrell. Two compelling men. Latest news from the world of sport, along with the best in opinion from our outstanding team of sports writers © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Groq continues innovation after raisingÂ $750M (September 2025) at a $9B valuation. Nvidia solidifies dominance amid competition fromÂ Cerebras SystemsÂ andÂ Google TPUs. In a move that further solidifies its dominance in the artificial intelligence (AI) sector, Nvidia has secured a non-exclusive licensing agreement with AI chip startup Groq, bringing aboard its founder, CEO Jonathan Ross, and key executives to bolster its inference technology capabilities. The deal, announced by Groq on Wednesday, Dec. 24, allows Nvidia to license Groq's proprietary AI inference technology while hiring Ross, President Sunny Madra, and other senior engineers. Groq will continue operating independently under new CEO Simon Edwards, with its cloud platform, GroqCloud, remaining unaffected. Groq, founded in 2016 by former Google engineers, specializes in AI inferenceâthe process of running trained AI models to generate predictions or responses, such as those seen in ChatGPT or image recognition systems. The company developed its customÂ Language Processing Unit (LPU), designed for high-speed, low-cost AI inference. "AI inference, in the context of artificial intelligence, refers to the process by which AI models draw conclusions or make predictions based on input data. This process is a fundamental aspect of AI, enabling machines to learn, reason and make decisions," said BrightU.AI's Enoch. AI inference can be categorized into two primary types: inductive and deductive inference. A third one, probabilistic inference, involves making decisions or drawing conclusions based on probabilities and statistical models. This type of inference is commonly used in Bayesian AI networks and Deep Learning models. Nvidia, already the leader in AI training chips, is now doubling down on inferenceâa critical next phase as AI shifts from development to real-world deployment. Jensen Huang, Nvidia's CEO, emphasized the strategic importance of the deal in an internal email obtained by CNBC: "We plan to integrate Groq's low-latency processors into the NVIDIA AI factory architecture, extending the platform to serve an even broader range of AI inference and real-time workloads." A new trend: Talent-focused deals The agreement follows a growing Silicon Valley trend where tech giants acquire key talent rather than entire companiesâa strategy that avoids regulatory hurdles while securing top-tier expertise. Recent examples include: Microsoft'sÂ deal withÂ Inflection AI, bringing co-founder Mustafa Suleyman onboard. Google'sÂ $2.5 billion licensing agreement withÂ Character.AI, hiring only select employees. Meta'sÂ $14 billion investment inÂ Scale AI, absorbing its CEO to lead AI initiatives. Alex Davis, CEO of Disruptive (a major Groq investor), confirmed to CNBC that Nvidia is acquiring Groq's assetsânot the entire companyâfor an estimatedÂ $20 billion, marking Nvidia's largest deal ever. Geopolitical implications: U.S. AI leadership The deal aligns with President Donald Trump'sÂ July executive orderÂ promoting the export of U.S. AI technology to maintain global dominance. Groq has been a key player in this initiative, powering AI infrastructure for Fortune 500 companies and overÂ 2 million developers worldwide. "Inference is defining this era of AI, and we're building the American infrastructure that delivers it with high speed and low cost," Ross stated in September. While Nvidia strengthens its AI ecosystem, Groq will continue innovating under new leadership. The startup had previously raisedÂ $750 million in September at a $6.9 billion valuation, with investors includingÂ BlackRock, Samsung and Donald Trump Jr.'s 1789 Capital. As AI transitions from lab development to global deployment, Nvidia's latest move ensures it remains at the forefrontâboth in trainingÂ andÂ inference. With competitors likeÂ Cerebras SystemsÂ andÂ Google's TPUsÂ vying for market share, the AI chip wars are far from over. For now, Nvidia's strategic talent grab reinforces its position as the undisputed leader in the AI revolution.

A third one, probabilistic inference, involves making decisions or drawing conclusions based on probabilities and statistical models. This type of inference is commonly used in Bayesian AI networks and Deep Learning models. Nvidia, already the leader in AI training chips, is now doubling down on inferenceâa critical next phase as AI shifts from development to real-world deployment. Jensen Huang, Nvidia's CEO, emphasized the strategic importance of the deal in an internal email obtained by CNBC: "We plan to integrate Groq's low-latency processors into the NVIDIA AI factory architecture, extending the platform to serve an even broader range of AI inference and real-time workloads." A new trend: Talent-focused deals The agreement follows a growing Silicon Valley trend where tech giants acquire key talent rather than entire companiesâa strategy that avoids regulatory hurdles while securing top-tier expertise. Recent examples include: Microsoft'sÂ deal withÂ Inflection AI, bringing co-founder Mustafa Suleyman onboard. Google'sÂ $2.5 billion licensing agreement withÂ Character.AI, hiring only select employees. Meta'sÂ $14 billion investment inÂ Scale AI, absorbing its CEO to lead AI initiatives. Alex Davis, CEO of Disruptive (a major Groq investor), confirmed to CNBC that Nvidia is acquiring Groq's assetsânot the entire companyâfor an estimatedÂ $20 billion, marking Nvidia's largest deal ever. Geopolitical implications: U.S. AI leadership The deal aligns with President Donald Trump'sÂ July executive orderÂ promoting the export of U.S. AI technology to maintain global dominance. Groq has been a key player in this initiative, powering AI infrastructure for Fortune 500 companies and overÂ 2 million developers worldwide. "Inference is defining this era of AI, and we're building the American infrastructure that delivers it with high speed and low cost," Ross stated in September. While Nvidia strengthens its AI ecosystem, Groq will continue innovating under new leadership. The startup had previously raisedÂ $750 million in September at a $6.9 billion valuation, with investors includingÂ BlackRock, Samsung and Donald Trump Jr.'s 1789 Capital. As AI transitions from lab development to global deployment, Nvidia's latest move ensures it remains at the forefrontâboth in trainingÂ andÂ inference.

Title: Ethereum's TVL could skyrocket '10X' in 2026: Sharplink CEO

A surge in stablecoins, tokenized RWAs and growing sovereign wealth fund interest could drive a major increase in Ethereum’s TVL in 2026, Sharplink’s co-CEO said. Cointelegraph in your social feed Ethereum’s total value locked (TVL) may surge ten-fold in 2026 as adoption expands across multiple use cases and institutional investors, according to Sharplink’s co-CEO Joseph Chalom. Sharplink Gaming is the second-largest public Ethereum treasury company, holding 797,704 ETH (ETH), worth roughly $2.33 billion at the time of publication, according to Ethereum Treasuries data. “The stablecoin market will hit $500B by the end of next year,” Chalom predicted in an X post on Friday, as the total stablecoin market capitalization currently sits at around $308.46 billion. A move to $500 billion would represent an increase of about 62%. With over half of the total stablecoin activity (54%) taking place on Ethereum, such a rise could potentially contribute to an increase in the network’s TVL. Chalom also expects tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) to see significant growth, forecasting the market will reach $300 billion in 2026. “Tokenized assets will 10X in AUM in 2026, going from tokenizing individual funds, stocks, and bonds to full fund complexes,” Chalom said. He pointed to rising interest over the past year from financial services companies including JPMorgan, Franklin Templeton, and BlackRock as a major catalyst. An increasing TVL is often seen as a sign of growing interest in the network, which can bolster market sentiment and potentially influence the price of the asset. At the time of publication, Ethereum’s TVL is around $68.20 billion, according to DeFiLlama. However, crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen said on Tuesday that Ether is unlikely to hit new highs in the coming year, given current conditions for Bitcoin. At the time of publication, Ether is trading at $2,924, down 3.12% over the past 30 days, according to CoinMarketCap. Chalom anticipates Ethereum holdings and tokenization activity by sovereign wealth funds to grow five- to tenfold over the next year.

Title: Etheruem’s tokenization role takes focus as Tom Lee outlines bullish outlook

Fundstrat’s head of research said institutional tokenization supports a $7,000–$9,000 Ether price in early 2026 and a longer-term case for $20,000. Cointelegraph in your social feed Ethereum’s growing role in institutional finance took center stage on CNBC’s Power Lunch this week, when Tom Lee, co-founder and head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, said Ether could climb to $7,000–$9,000 by early 2026 as Wall Street accelerates efforts to tokenize assets and move financial activity onchain. Lee said Ether’s (ETH) investment case is increasingly tied to its use as financial infrastructure, as Wall Street experiments with onchain settlement and tokenized securities. “Wall Street wants to tokenize everything,” Lee said, pointing to initiatives at Robinhood and BlackRock. The shift, he said, could bring efficiencies to traditional finance while anchoring real-world use cases on Ether. He added that Ether could eventually reach $20,000 as adoption deepens. He was also bullish on Bitcoin (BTC), calling it a “genuine store of value” and saying a move to $200,000 next year “makes a lot of sense,” framing its recent underperformance versus gold as temporary. Lee is also chairman of BitMine Immersion Technologies, the leading Ether-focused treasury company that has reported holdings of 4,066,062 ETH, according to CoinGecko data. Related: 70% of Ether positions are 'long' as whale accumulation tightens ETH supply Tokenized real-world assets, traditional financial instruments and physical assets represented onchain have expanded rapidly this year, with total market value rising to about $18.9 billion, up from roughly $5.6 billion at the start of 2025. According to data from RWA.xyz, US Treasury debt is the largest tokenized asset class at around $8.5 billion, followed by commodities at approximately $3.4 billion. Ethereum currently accounts for the majority of tokenized RWA value across public blockchains. As of late December 2025, the network hosts more than $12 billion in tokenized assets, well ahead of alternatives such as BNB Chain, Solana and Arbitrum. Ethereum also leads stablecoin issuance, with roughly $170 billion in stablecoins issued on the network, reinforcing its role as the primary settlement layer for dollar-denominated activity onchain. Institutional interest in tokenized RWAs continued to build in December, when the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) said it plans to tokenize a portion of US Treasury securities held at its Depository Trust Company subsidiary on the Canton Network. DTCC operates post-trade infrastructure for US securities markets, with its subsidiaries processing about $3.7 quadrillion in securities transactions last year.

Title: Expert Alleges Bitcoin Under Siege Again, ETFs And BlackRock Suspected
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-under-siege-etfs-and-blackrock-suspected/
Time Published: 2025-12-26T19:52:41Z

The recent surge in Bitcoin (BTC) volatility has led to significant liquidations, prompting renewed suspicions of market manipulation among experts. A detailed analysis by market expert NoLimit on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter) reveals that, at the time of the stock market opening, BlackRock’s Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) IBIT transferred hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of Bitcoin into Coinbase Prime wallets. This timing and location indicate a pattern that institutions often follow when selling their assets. As explained, these coins are not sent to Coinbase Prime merely to remain inactive; they are typically directed there for sale or liquidity management purposes. NoLimit asserts that when a major player like BlackRock needs to liquidate assets or meet redemption demands, the price of Bitcoin reacts rapidly. He suggests that this situation reflects a combination of factors: selling related to ETFs taking place during low liquidity, inventory management in anticipation of upcoming volatility, and risk reduction in light of a significant derivatives event. Compounding these concerns, technical analyst OxNobler highlighted further developments that contributed to the recent downturn, detailing significant sell-offs by various trading platforms. In a rapid succession of transactions, Binance reportedly sold 10,155 BTC, Wintermute let go of 5,354 BTC, Coinbase disposed of 10,113 BTC, BlackRock sold 4,945 BTC, and Kraken moved 4,630 BTC. Collectively, these actions amounted to over $2.5 billion worth of Bitcoin sold within a mere 30 minutes, raising suspicions of coordinated market manipulation. According to analysts from Bull Theory, the situation has taken a dire turn, with Bitcoin plummeting by $2,300 and liquidating $66 million in long positions in just 45 minutes. Against this backdrop, $60 billion has been wiped from the crypto market without any negative news triggering such a drastic shift. This scenario has led them to assert that manipulation continues to be a significant concern within the broader crypto market. At the time of writing, BTC was trading at $87,340, down slightly more than 30% from its all-time highs set earlier in October.

Instead, most of the biggest headlines attached to the financial services organization were irrelevant to trading screens, most notably the conclusion to its years-long battle with the SEC, major acquisitions to propel its future growth, and the launch of a billion-dollar stablecoin product—RLUSD. Below we’ll look back at the biggest highlights for XRP and Ripple in 2025. More than four years after it began, the legal dispute between Ripple Labs Inc. and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) officially came to a close in August. The landmark case, which investigated whether or not sales of XRP violated securities laws, extended back to December 2020. In 2023, a partial ruling favored Ripple Labs, but appeals and counter-appeals extended the saga into 2025. However, with the election of President Donald Trump and a crypto-friendlier regulatory administration, the pair opted to find a jointly negotiated resolution in early 2025. That negotiated resolution was later denied by a U.S. district judge, and then by the courts, so eventually the pair agreed to drop their respective appeals—ending the affair for good and cementing the 2023 ruling in Ripple’s favor as a precedent for future crypto classifications. Prior to 2025, XRP had last traded above $3.00 in 2018. Seven years later, and around a month before the conclusion to Ripple Labs’ yearslong legal battle with the SEC, the Ripple-linked XRP made a new all-time high of $3.65, according to data from CoinGecko, surging beyond its previous high mark of $3.40 from 2018. That made XRP the third-largest crypto asset by market capitalization at the time, trailing just Bitcoin and Ethereum. With regulatory scrutiny waning, analysts at the time told Decrypt that investors “believed in Ripple's vision for a regulatory-compliant blockchain for institutions.” Though its rapid rise placed the token in a range it had not seen since 2018, investment firms like Standard Chartered maintained even higher end-of-year price targets for XRP during the summer—expecting a move to $5.50 by the end of year. That mark seems unlikely now though, despite the acceleration of the tokenization trend that Standard Chartered highlighted as a potential catalyst for the price of XRP. XRP, now the fourth-largest asset by market capitalization, was changing hands at $1.90 as of December 15, around 48% off its July all-time high. After the approval and ensuing success of ETFs for crypto majors Bitcoin and Ethereum, both investors and fund issuers were eager to get altcoin ETFs—like those for XRP, Solana, and Dogecoin—to market. As a result, applications for altcoin ETFs flooded the SEC, and by June, expert opinions predicted the likelihood of their approvals as a “near lock” for 2025. Those opinions were further validated in September when the SEC cleared a path to approval for new ETFs by signing off on new generic listing standards. Around that time, Rex Shares and Osprey Funds got their joint XRP ETF to market—an Act 40 ETF that follows different listing standards than other crypto ETFs. Demand for the product was shown immediately, grabbing $38 million in day one volume, good enough to mark the year’s biggest debut up until that point. Shortly thereafter, though, more traditional spot ETF products from Canary Capital, Grayscale, Bitwise, and Franklin Templeton hit the market. In December, leveraged products hit the market as well, allowing investors to double their exposure to XRP’s gains. Since their launch, the spot ETFs have generated nearly $1 billion in net inflows without a single day of outflows, according to data from CoinGlass, as of December 15. XRP eclipsed a major milestone in 2025, but so did Ripple Labs’ stablecoin, RLUSD. First launched in December 2024, the dollar-backed stablecoin frontran the growing trend of stablecoin products from other financial giants like Western Union and JP Morgan, and the passing of the GENIUS Act, which provided regulatory clarity on the issuance and trading of the fiat-backed tokens. In the year since its launch, functionality for RLUSD has expanded. In September it was added to Securitize’s tokenization platform, a BlackRock-backed platform that now allows users to exchange shares of tokenized money market funds for RLUSD. In December the firm earned approval to broaden payment services, including RLUSD, in Singapore as well. It's being used for credit card settlements too, thanks to a partnership with Mastercard and WebBank, the issuer of crypto exchange Gemini’s credit card products. While RLUSD is regulated by the New York Department of Financial Services, Ripple applied for a National Bank Charter in July, following the lead of USDC issuer Circle, as it aims to become the “benchmark for trust” in the stablecoin market. And it received conditional approval in December, alongside other stablecoin issuers. At the time of writing, the stablecoin has reached a $1.3 billion market cap, making it the 11th largest stablecoin in less than a year since its launch, according to data from DefiLlama. Though closely linked to XRP, Ripple is much larger and more expansive than a single crypto token, and its footprint grew considerably throughout 2025 thanks to major acquisitions. In April, the firm forked over $1.25 billion to acquire primer brokerage Hidden Road as it aimed to better serve institutional clients on a larger scale. It then spent another $1 billion to acquire treasury asset management firm GTreasury in October, in a play that will reduce friction and costs associated with legacy financial systems, according to CEO Brad Garlinghouse. It surrounded that acquisition with two others, paying $200 million to add Toronto-based stablecoin platform Rail, and an undisclosed amount on wallet-as-a-service provider Palisade. All told, Ripple's acquisitions in 2025 maintain a similar theme, improving payment efficiencies while expanding its financial services offerings. Those moves helped the firm notch a $500 million investment in November, valuing it at $40 billion and cementing its place among the current and future leaders of the crypto industry. "This investment isn’t just validation of Ripple’s growth strategy and business built on the foundation of XRP, but also a clear bet on what the future of crypto will look like," Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse wrote on X. "I’m very proud of what we’ve built, and all that’s to come."

Nvidia gains key talent from Google's TPU project to bolster its own chip development. The transaction highlights the critical and costly race for control over foundational AI hardware. The transaction highlights the critical and costly race for control over foundational AI hardware. In a move that reshapes the battlefield of artificial intelligence hardware, chip giant Nvidia has strategically deployed a massive $20 billion to secure the technology and brains behind a key startup, Groq. This deal, structured as a licensing agreement and talent acquisition, represents Nvidia's largest such transaction ever and is a direct response to rising competition, particularly from Google's custom tensor processing units (TPUs). For those watching the high-stakes race for AI inference supremacy, this is a clear signal that the arms race is accelerating, with Nvidia pulling out its checkbook to maintain its edge. The agreement, announced just before the Christmas holiday, sees Nvidia licensing Groq's AI inference technology and hiring away its founder and CEO, Jonathan Ross, along with President Sunny Madra and other senior leaders. Ross is a pivotal figure, having previously helped launch Google's TPU project. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang outlined the rationale in an internal email, stating, "We plan to integrate Groqâs low-latency processors into the NVIDIA AI factory architecture, extending the platform to serve an even broader range of AI inference and real-time workloads." A deal structured for scrutiny While publicly framed as a "non-exclusive licensing agreement," multiple reports confirm the total value approaches $20 billion in cash for Groq's assets. This complex structure is widely seen as a tactic to navigate intense antitrust scrutiny. Groq will continue to operate independently, at least in name, with its finance chief Simon Edwards becoming the new CEO. Its cloud service, GroqCloud, will also continue operating. As Huang noted, "While we are adding talented employees to our ranks and licensing Groqâs IP, we are not acquiring Groq as a company." This "acqui-hire plus licensing" model has become a common playbook for Big Tech. Similar deals have been executed by Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, and Nvidia itself earlier this year. The approach allows giants to rapidly absorb innovative technology and top-tier talent without triggering the same level of regulatory review as a traditional acquisition. Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon observed, "Antitrust would seem to be be the primary risk here, though structuring the deal as a non-exclusive license may keep the fiction of competition alive." The Google factor and inference wars The strategic impetus for this massive expenditure is clear. Nvidia, while dominant in chips for training AI models, faces a growing challenge in the inference market, where trained models deliver answers to user queries. Google's custom TPUs have gained significant momentum here, offering an alternative to Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs). Groq's specialty is its "language processing unit" chips, designed specifically for fast, efficient inference. By bringing Groq's technology and TPU-savvy leadership in-house, Nvidia is buying a shortcut to compete more directly with Google's in-house advances. This is a defensive and offensive move, ensuring its hardware remains the go-to choice as the AI industry's focus increasingly shifts from training models to deploying them at scale. The deal came together rapidly, reportedly just months after Groq raised $750 million at a $6.9 billion valuation in September. It is crucial to distinguish Groq from "Grok," the AI chatbot developed by Elon Musk's xAI. The similar names are a coincidence, but this deal is purely about the underlying silicon that powers such AI applications. For investors who backed Groq's recent funding round, including firms like BlackRock and a fund where Donald Trump Jr. is a partner, the payoff is staggering: a tripling of their investment in roughly three months. This highlights the immense financial firepower Nvidia has accumulated, with more than $60 billion in cash on hand, and its willingness to spend it to consolidate power. The conclusion is unmistakable. In the relentless march of AI progress, control over the foundational hardware is paramount. Nvidia's historic $20 billion deal is not just a purchase of technology; it is an investment in maintaining sovereignty over the future of computation itself. As custom chips from tech giants and well-funded startups emerge, this move proves that even the market leader cannot afford to simply innovate; it must also strategically assimilate. Sources for this article include: ZeroHedge.com WSJ.com Reuters.com CNBC.com The agreement, announced just before the Christmas holiday, sees Nvidia licensing Groq's AI inference technology and hiring away its founder and CEO, Jonathan Ross, along with President Sunny Madra and other senior leaders. Ross is a pivotal figure, having previously helped launch Google's TPU project. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang outlined the rationale in an internal email, stating, "We plan to integrate Groqâs low-latency processors into the NVIDIA AI factory architecture, extending the platform to serve an even broader range of AI inference and real-time workloads." A deal structured for scrutiny While publicly framed as a "non-exclusive licensing agreement," multiple reports confirm the total value approaches $20 billion in cash for Groq's assets.

Title: Bitcoin whales move $230mln to exchanges, yet BTC holds range – Why?

Big wallets moved Bitcoin to exchanges, but price hesitation left traders questioning the next move. Bitcoin’s muted price action, paired with renewed whale activity, unsettled market sentiment on the 25th of December. On that day, a long-dormant Bitcoin whale and asset manager BlackRock transferred large BTC amounts to exchanges, according to Onchain Lens. Onchain Lens reported that BlackRock deposited 2,292 Bitcoin [BTC], worth $199.8 million, into Coinbase. Separately, a whale wallet dormant for eight years deposited 400 BTC, valued at $34.92 million, into OKX. Large holders often shape short-term sentiment, as traders monitor such transfers for potential sell-side pressure. That dynamic left market participants cautious, even without immediate confirmation of spot selling. On top of that, U.S. Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds extended their losing streak. SoSoValue data showed Spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded five consecutive days of net outflows. Source: SoSoValue That pattern suggested institutional demand remained fragile despite Bitcoin holding above key technical support. Together, ETF outflows and exchange deposits reinforced a defensive market tone. At press time, Bitcoin traded near $87,700, down roughly 0.35% on the day. During the same period, Open Interest fell 0.99% to $57.42 billion, reflecting reduced leverage exposure. That decline signaled traders unwound risk rather than positioning aggressively for a breakout. Even so, intraday positioning hinted at localized bullish conviction. Source: CoinGlass According to CoinGlass’ Liquidation Map, major leverage clusters sat near $85,966 below price and $88,636 above. At these levels, intraday traders have built $646.17 million worth of long-leveraged positions and $422.42 million worth of short-leveraged positions. This suggests that traders were tilted toward the bullish side and strongly believe that BTC’s price will not fall below the $85,966 level. AMBCrypto’s technical analysis on the weekly chart revealed that BTC has been in a tight consolidation zone between the $86,000 and $93,500 levels since the 17th of November. Historically, consolidation breakouts or breakdowns lead to major rallies or declines, and as BTC’s price approaches the lower boundary, it has sparked fear of a potential breakdown below this range. Source: TradingView Based on the price action, if sentiment remains unchanged and BTC breaks below the key support at $86,000 with a daily candle close beneath it, it could open the door to a massive downside move. However, the bearish outlook would only be invalidated if BTC breaks out above the upper boundary at the $93,500 level.

Since the start of January, the overall U.S. dollar-denominated stablecoin supply has increased by more than $100 billion, to $314 billion total. But that doesn’t mean all boats have risen at the same rate. To measure stablecoin performance, Decrypt calculated velocity using historical data from crypto price aggregator CoinGecko from January through December 15. Velocity divides total volume by average supply, resulting in a calculation of how many times each coin has, on average, changed hands. As former Commodities and Futures Trading Commission Chairman Timothy Massad explained to Decrypt, measuring velocity beats rankings that rely only on total supply. “Stablecoins can be very useful without there being a large market cap,” he said. “In other words, it's really the velocity, the transaction use, and they can circulate very quickly even if the amount outstanding is not that great.” Tether tops the list with a velocity of 166 because it’s long been a workhorse for global crypto trading. It can’t claim the crown as the first-ever stablecoin—that belongs to BitUSD. But it launched the same year, in 2014, and became the first widely used one. Tether boasts a market capitalization of $186 billion after increasing 35% since the start of the year, according to CoinGecko data. The bulk of Tether tokens get traded on Ethereum (46.3%) and Tron (41.4%), according to DeFi Llama data. Tether began the year by relocating to Bitcoin-friendly El Salvador, where President Nayib Bukele declared BTC legal tender in 2021. There have been a few bumps, though. In March, Binance said it would delist USDT for European Union users to stay compliant with MiCA regulations, which require stablecoin issuers to be licensed. But that’s not stopped the company from turning a hefty profit. So far in 2025, Tether has seen $10 billion in profit in the first three quarters of the year, the company said in October. Ripple Labs’ stablecoin, RLUSD, swiped the second spot with a velocity of 71. That means, on average, every RLUSD token has changed hands 71 times since the start of the year. In most stablecoin lineups, Circle’s USDC would hold this spot because its $78 billion market capitalization trumps that of RLUSD’s $1.3 billion. But as Massad pointed out, stablecoin performance has more to do with being able to move money efficiently than its total supply. Ripple was provisionally approved for a national banking charter by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, or OCC, in December. “This is a massive step forward—first for RLUSD— setting the highest standard for stablecoin compliance with both federal (OCC) & state (NYDFS) oversight,” Ripple Labs CEO Brad Garlinghouse wrote on X. HUGE news! @Ripple just received conditional approval from the @USOCC to charter Ripple National Trust Bank. This is a massive step forward - first for $RLUSD, setting the highest standard for stablecoin compliance with both federal (OCC) & state (NYDFS) oversight. To the… — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) December 12, 2025 Ripple Senior Vice President of Stablecoins Jack McDonald has often pointed out that RLUSD was specifically designed for institutional use. At the start of December, Ripple got the green light from the Singapore Monetary Authority, or MAS, to expand XRP and RLUSD payments in Singapore. And earlier this year, RLUSD was integrated into Securitize's tokenization platform. That means it’s one of the assets investors can swap for tokenized money market funds. USDC saw its velocity reach 56 in 2025, while its market capitalization climbed 78% to $78.4 billion by December 15. Perhaps more than any of its competitors, Circle benefitted massively from the passage of the GENIUS Act. Its operating model already resembled the federally regulated framework that’s now become U.S. law. That’s given Circle a head start on compliance and investor confidence—and investors took note. CRCL was so popular with investors on its debut that the NYSE halted trading three times. Since then, Circle has reported $740 million in Q3 revenue, marking a 66% year-over-year increase. Circle has also rolled out the testnet for Arc, its layer-1 blockchain, which counts BlackRock, Visa, and Amazon Web Services as early participants. Circle was also one of several stablecoin issuers—including Ripple, Paxos and BitGo—which got a provisional approval for its national banking charter and will be looking to expand into broader financial services. USD1 is an outlier because it launched in April, and therefore doesn’t have nearly a full year’s worth of data. But that didn’t stop it from landing right next to the podium with a velocity of 39. Issued by World Liberty Financial—the crypto-focused firm co-founded by Donald Trump Jr. and partners—USD1 was designed from the outset to be a highly liquid transactional stablecoin. The token reached a $1 billion market cap in April, less than a month after its launch, according to data from CoinGecko. There have been some very bullish predictions about its growth. Blockstreet’s Kyle Klemmer told Decrypt he believes USD1 will be the world’s dominant stablecoin, beating USDT and USDC, before President Donald Trump’s second term ends in 2029. The project has leaned heavily on retail distribution and promotional partnerships, including integrations with several U.S.-based crypto exchanges, like Coinbase and FalconX, and it’s making a bid to become “Solana’s go-to stablecoin” by teaming up with meme coin platform Bonk and decentralized exchange Raydium. PayPal USD’s velocity of 18 lands it in fifth place on this list. Its 2023 debut made big waves because it was the first time an established payments platform made a bid at issuing a stablecoin—years before there was a regulatory framework in the U.S.. For most of this year, growth for PYUSD moved at a modest pace. Its market capitalization peaked above $1 billion in June and then established a foothold in September. Since then, it’s nearly tripled to $3.8 billion as of December 15. PayPal has teamed with LayerZero to expand the token’s presence to nine new blockchains, including Tron, Abstract, Aptos, and Avalanche. But there’s also been some controversy. In October, observers noted that PYUSD issuer Paxos minted and then immediately burned $300 trillion worth of tokens. It’s an impossibly large number of tokens, given it represents more than twice the world’s GDP. At 3:12 PM EST, Paxos mistakenly minted excess PYUSD as part of an internal transfer. Paxos immediately identified the error and burned the excess PYUSD. This was an internal technical error. There is no security breach. Customer funds are safe. We have addressed the root… — Paxos (@Paxos) October 15, 2025 "This was an internal technical error. There is no security breach,” the firm wrote on X. “Customer funds are safe. We have addressed the root cause." Ethena Labs’ USDe demonstrated a velocity of 11 in 2025, with its market capitalization showing a modest gain of 11% from $5.8 billion in January to $6.5 billion by December 15. But that trajectory leaves out the fact that its market cap soared to nearly $15 billion before the early October flash crash. USDe is the only stablecoin on this list that isn’t backed by fiat currency: It’s backed by a delta-neutral strategy involving staked Ethereum and perpetual futures hedges. But its reliance on derivatives means that times of high volatility and shifts in sentiment can cause big swings in market capitalization. Even with a less straightforward structure, the token’s advocates include billionaire Arthur Hayes. But not all regulators are convinced. Ethena Labs pulled out of the German market in April over growing scrutiny over its “serious deficiencies” in compliance. Sky’s USDS showed extremely low velocity of 1 in 2025—and that’s by design. To avoid confusion: Sky is a rebrand of DeFi OG MakerDAO and USDS is a rebrand of its DAI stablecoin. Unlike USDT or USDC, which function as transactional stablecoins, most USDS tokens sit locked in Maker vaults or savings contracts as collateral for DeFi loans rather than circulating. Its role in DeFi is closer to a yield-bearing savings instrument than digital cash, so it naturally turns over far less often. For example, the Sky Protocol currently offers a 4% rewards rate (paid in SKY tokens) to users who hold USDS. As of 2025, USDS has seen its market capitalization grow from $5.2 billion at the start of the year to $9.8 billion, marking an 85% increase in just under 12 months.

Title: Why Are Bitcoin And Ethereum Prices Crashing Again?

Time Published: 2025-12-25T18:30:25Z
Full Content:
The Bitcoin and Ethereum prices are crashing again, with the crypto market failing to record a ‘Santa rally’ like other major assets. This comes as BTC and ETH continue to face significant selling pressure from the crypto ETFs, which are facing sustained outflows. The Bitcoin and Ethereum prices are down again amid selling pressure from the BTC and ETH ETFs. According to Arkham data, BlackRock deposited 2,292 BTC ($200 million) and 9,976 ETH ($29 million) into Coinbase yesterday, likely to sell these coins. This marked the second time this week that the world’s largest asset manager had sent BTC and ETH to Coinbase in a bid to offload these coins. Further data from Arkham shows that BlackRock deposited 2,838.78 Bitcoin ($255 million) and 29,928 Ethereum ($91.29 million) into Coinbase on December 22. These sell-offs come as the crypto ETFs continue to record significant outflows. The BTC ETFs have seen a total net outflow of $330 million this week, while the ETH ETFs have a weekly net outflow of $11 million. This indicates that the institutional interest in Bitcoin and Ethereum is fading at the moment, which provides a bearish outlook for the largest crypto assets by market cap. A CoinShares report released earlier this week revealed that Bitcoin ETFs saw outflows of $460 million last week, while Ethereum ETPs saw outflows of $555 million. From a macro perspective, the Bitcoin and Ethereum prices have also continued to decline as the Fed looks unlikely to cut interest rates at the January FOMC meeting. The recent U.S. GDP and jobless claims reports have sparked a surge in the odds that the Fed will hold rates steady next month. A CryptoQuant analysis revealed that the bear market risk is becoming more relevant based on the Bitcoin Combined Market Index (BCMI). The BCMI is said to be below equilibrium at the moment but well above historical bottom zones. This suggests that there is still more room for the BTC price to drop to the downside. The CryptoQuant analysis stated that from a data-driven perspective, this opens the possibility that Bitcoin is transitioning into a bear phase and not just experiencing a pullback. If history repeats itself, BTC is expected to form a more durable bottom if the BCMI revisits the 2019 to 2023 levels. The analysis added that this is a scenario worth considering, as at this stage, the market appears to be in a downward transition rather than a completed reset.

Title: Crypto sentiment is trapped in extreme fear because the industry’s biggest structural wins are failing to move prices

Investors won the policy battles, the regulatory clarity, and the institutional access they wanted. Bitcoin still dropped 30% and looks to finish the year negative. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Crypto sentiment gauges have spent the past two months deep in the red. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index has spent more than 30% of 2025 in fear or extreme fear territory, and alternative trackers put the market in a 10-25 range out of 100 since mid-November. Bitcoin is on track for its worst fourth quarter since 2018, many large altcoins are down up to 90% from their highs, and gold, silver, and major stock indices pushed to new highs in the same period. The mood is poisonous. Investors got all of the macro, the policy, the structural wins they'd been lobbying for since 2021, and the reward was a market that faded every rally and underperformed every competing asset class. That's not how cycles are supposed to end. It's how trust collapses, and narratives break. Understanding why sentiment cratered requires unpacking five overlapping drivers: performance versus expectations, thinning liquidity, brutal leverage washouts, confusing macro conditions, and narrative fatigue that turned bullish milestones into sell-the-news traps. Bitcoin hit an all-time high of $126,000 in October, with a setup that looked clean: spot ETFs drew record inflows, the US government shutdown sparked a safe-haven narrative, and a third rate cut was set. Yet, instead of the parabolic fourth quarter many anticipated, Bitcoin dropped 30% and is finishing the year down single digits, marking its worst fourth quarter since 2018. Bitcoin faces record institutional demand and macroeconomic uncertainty, key drivers converging to push it to new highs. Altcoins fared worse, down up to 90% from their highs, wiped out by thin liquidity and the realization that most tokens launched between 2024 and 2025 had no product-market fit beyond speculation. The divergence with traditional assets only compounded the pain. Gold gained 70%, silver rallied 143%, and the S&P 500 pushed to new highs. Crypto investors watched their portfolios bleed while every other “debasement hedge” printed gains. That divergence creates a specific kind of sentiment poison: the feeling that you got the thesis right but chose the wrong instrument, or worse, that the asset class is broken. When performance lags expectations by that margin, and the setup looks perfect, sentiment doesn't soften; it collapses. On-chain data shows Bitcoin transaction volumes and active addresses trending down since November, with daily volume down sharply and activity falling by double digits. VanEck's mid-December chain report flagged weak fees, stagnant new addresses, and soft hash-rate growth. Derivatives and futures volumes have been sliding since late August, and multiple trading desks describe “weak buying pressure” around the $87,000-$90,000 band. When prices chop lower on declining volume, it signals that buyers have stepped away. Bitcoin tested support repeatedly, failed to reclaim higher levels, and each failed bounce reinforced the perception that the market had no conviction. With 2025 marking drastic valuation drop-offs, token launch strategies face scrutiny for prioritizing unicorn dreams over practical fundamentals. Thinning liquidity also amplifies downside volatility. Without deep bids, small sell orders gap the market lower, triggering stop-losses and liquidations that feed the fear gauges. The decline in active addresses suggests retail is exiting. Institutions provide capital but not the speculative energy that drives crypto's upside volatility. When retail leaves, the market becomes a battle between levered traders and long-term holders, with neither willing to chase prices higher. That produces the grinding, low-volume selloff that defined the fourth quarter. The November crash combined profit-taking above $100,000, ETF outflows, and an estimated $20 billion leverage flush in October. Long-dormant “OG” wallets moved and sold hundreds of thousands of Bitcoin into strength, which many read as “smart money top-ticking the cycle.” The leverage flush was mechanical: Bitcoin rallied above $120,000, open interest hit records, funding rates spiked, and the market overheated. When Bitcoin failed to break higher and started selling off, liquidations cascaded. Longs turned into forced sellers, stop-losses triggered, and the structure unwound in days. That kind of forced selling doesn't just move prices; it breaks sentiment. The long-term holder distribution added psychological damage. When wallets that haven't moved in years suddenly activate and sell, the market interprets it as insiders exiting. That perception may not be accurate, but it matters more than reality when forming sentiment. If the market believes “smart money” sold the top, everyone else assumes they're holding the bag. That belief becomes self-fulfilling: remaining holders sell to avoid being last out, which drives prices lower, reinforcing fear and driving more selling. Recent US inflation prints and Fed communications increased the odds of 2026 rate cuts, but not enough to give a clear “lower for longer” signal. Crypto mirrored every wobble in risk assets rather than trading like a haven, reinforcing the perception that Bitcoin is a high-beta tech exposure rather than a store of value. When the dollar weakened, Bitcoin rallied briefly. When risk appetite faded, Bitcoin sold off harder than equities. That pattern destroyed the “digital gold” narrative, at least for now. Additionally, regulatory progress has been messy. Europe is implementing MiCA, forcing exchanges and stablecoin issuers to comply or exit. The US GENIUS Act is turning into concrete stablecoin rules, but it won't be finalized until 2027. The CLARITY Act stalled after a long government shutdown. A January markup is the start of the sausage-making process, not the finish line Sacks claims. The industry also faces a wave of private lawsuits as SEC enforcement recedes, keeping legal risk at the forefront. None of that screams “clean runway.” The confusion matters because crypto's 2025 thesis rested on clarity: spot ETFs would bring institutional capital, a crypto-friendly administration would remove regulatory overhang, and macro conditions would favor hard assets. All three happened, but the payoff didn't materialize. That gap between thesis and outcome drives sentiment from optimism to confusion to fear. 2025 delivered a “crypto president,” spot ETFs, big-name IPOs like Circle's, and tokenization headlines from BlackRock, but prices dropped after every event. Trump's election was supposed to be bullish, but Bitcoin sold off. Spot ETF inflows hit records, but Bitcoin chopped sideways then dropped. Circle's IPO was supposed to validate the sector, but it came and went with no sustained price reaction. Each milestone became a sell-the-news trap. Altcoins underperformed badly while gold and silver stole the “hard asset” spotlight. When a sector gets most of the structural wins it's been lobbying for and still underperforms, retail's default mood shifts from euphoria to disappointment. The crypto market just nuked, with the largest ever liquidation event in 24 hours and a bloodbath for altcoins triggering traders' PTSD. The industry won policy battles, regulatory clarity, institutional access, and political support, but none of it translated into sustained price appreciation. Instead, the wins became exhaustion points: smart money sold the announcements, retail bought the hype, and prices ended up lower. Narrative fatigue means investors stop believing in the next catalyst. When every bullish event has been a selling opportunity, why would the next one be different? The market becomes a trap: good news doesn't move prices, bad news accelerates selling. That's the environment that produces extreme fear and keeps it pinned for months. The extreme fear readings capture a market that feels betrayed by its own thesis. Investors believed in the halving cycle, the ETF narrative, the regulatory clarity story, and the macro setup. All of those things happened, and the market still sold off. That's not just disappointing for traders chasing profits, it's disorienting for everyone with stakes in the market. Extreme fear can be a contrarian signal. Historically, some of the best entry points come when sentiment is at its worst. ETF flows hit $941 million in two months, but real adoption hinges on Ripple's ODL volumes, on-chain payments, and RLUSD growth on XRPL. However, that only works if underlying conditions improve. Right now, the conditions that drove fear, such as thinning liquidity, leverage overhang, macro confusion, and narrative fatigue, haven't resolved. They've settled into a new equilibrium where prices chop lower, volume declines, and nobody wants to call a bottom. Until one or more of those conditions break, sentiment will stay depressed. The question for 2026 is whether the market can find a catalyst strong enough to reverse that trend, or whether this cycle ends not with a bang but with a slow, grinding capitulation that leaves the entire narrative in ruins.

The world's most viewed site on global warming and climate change From Tilak’s Substack In the aftermath of the UN’s COP30 climate summit in Belem, Brazil, several commentators have claimed that the age of climate alarmism may finally be fraying at the edges. The Wall Street Journal concluded that Europe’s green energy policies slashed emissions but at the cost of crippling the economy. PJ Media’s Rick Moran argues that “the religion of climate alarmism is in decline”. He finds that President Donald Trump’s “energy dominance” agenda and the high-profile defection from the climate alarmist priesthood by Bill Gates has begun to alter the debate over climate change. Peter Savodnik of the Free Press wrote last week that those who questioned the calamity of climate change were treated like pariahs for years but now, “their day of vindication has come”. He cites Bjorn Lomborg, who opined that “I believe we are witnessing a broader, more balanced reassessment of climate change”. The evidence against climate alarmism is no longer relegated to alternative media. It is visible in electricity bills that have exploded precisely in those countries and states – Germany, Great Britain, California – most exposed to wind and solar absolutism. It became apparent in the great Iberian Peninsula blackout in April, which lasted for hours and led to the deaths of 11 people, a systemwide failure due to insufficient fossil fuels-based synchronous generation and an excessive reliance on inverter-based solar power. It is evident in Europe’s industrial heartlands, hollowed out by irrational energy policies sold as moral imperatives but delivered as economic self-sabotage. Yet another reminder of Western Europe’s on-going deindustrialisation emerged two days ago, as the Financial Times reported that Volkswagen will stop manufacturing vehicles at its site in Dresden, marking the first time in the carmaker’s 88-year history that it will close production at a site in Germany. Even in the EU, the epicentre of green utopianism, policymakers have come under pressure from powerful business lobbies to weaken proposed ‘sustainability’ rules as part of a drive to reduce burdens on domestic enterprises. AP reported yesterday that European officials moved to ease their ban on sales of cars with internal combustion engines by 2035, responding to pressure from governments and automakers who argued that the industry needed more flexibility to help achieve EU climate goals. Climate as Theology Yet, belief in imminent climate catastrophe remains remarkably resilient among Western elites. Optimism in rationality prevailing may be premature. The Church of Climate, with its high priests and devoted flock, has proven remarkably resilient over decades, weathering empirical assaults and expert rebuttals with the tenacity of a faith unmoored from facts. The question worth asking is no longer whether the alarmists are right — they are not — but why the creed survives so unscathed by evidence, falsification and repeated policy failure. This durability is not rational. It is moral, ideological and ultimately theological. For many years now, serious scientists and scholars with unimpeachable credentials — William Happer, John Clauser, Judith Curry and many others — have demolished the claim that the climate system is threatened with an imminent apocalypse caused by fossil fuel-based emissions. Steve Koonin’s careful exposition of the data made this plain to any reader willing to separate evidence from rhetoric. And yet these arguments yield no value to the priesthood of climate alarm. The reason is simple: the dispute is not about data. It is about virtue and the seductive promise of meaningfulness. Climate alarmism long ago ceased to be a scientific hypothesis and became instead a moral identity. Its adherents see themselves as uniquely compassionate, enlightened and willing to ‘care for the planet’ in contrast to the supposedly venal, backward or morally defective climate change deniers. These ‘deniers’, as the inquisitors label them, are not fringe figures but guardians of scientific integrity against a modern Lysenkoism where dissent is heresy. Climate alarmism serves another powerful purpose. It is the modern expression of what Friedrich Hayek called the “fatal conceit“: the belief that a self-appointed elite, armed with models and moral certainty, can out-think the dispersed intelligence of markets, societies and freely choosing individuals. This conceit is reinforced by what might be called the ‘noble lie‘. Many within the climate establishment openly or tacitly believe that exaggeration is justified — indeed necessary — if it nudges the masses toward ‘correct’ behaviour. If climate change must be overstated, so be it. If uncertainty must be suppressed, that too is a price worth paying. The end — planetary salvation — justifies the means. Layered into the climate alarmist narrative is yet another dimension of political calculus that aids social-democrat governments in power throughout the West with the significant exception of Trump’s America. The ever-imminent climate catastrophe handily provides politicians with the perfect hobgoblin that elicits among their constituents’ clamorous calls for being led to safety, as H. L. Mencken reminded us in his maxim on practical politics. Given these potent advantages of having a theology of climate, empirical refutation becomes irrelevant. Data that contradicts the narrative are not debated but delegitimised. Critics are not engaged; they are denounced. Expertise is not weighed; it is moralised. Hence the curious phenomenon of genuine Nobel-calibre physicists being dismissed as ‘deniers’, while political activists and failed politicians – the Bill McKibbens, Al Gores and Michael Manns of the world – are elevated to the status of scientific authorities and prophetic sages. The Package Deal But climate alarmism does not travel alone. It is part of a broader ideological package deal — an interlocking set of beliefs that reinforce one another psychologically and politically. The same individual who believes that capitalism is a form of exploitation will tend also to believe that Western industrial society is uniquely destructive. That same person is also likely to believe that markets cannot be trusted to allocate resources and that ‘crises’ — climate, Covid, inequality — require emergency powers of an overweening state. Unsurprisingly, this worldview also aligns neatly with support for Net Zero, ESG, DEI, gender ideology, industrial policy, public health lockdowns and the ever-expanding administrative state. This ideological coherence is not accidental. It reflects the long influence of identity-based cultural Marxism, which taught generations of Western intellectuals to interpret social and economic phenomena primarily through the lens of power, domination and historical white guilt. In this worldview, the legacy of Western development — from the Age of Exploration onward — is not human flourishing but original sin. Climate change thus becomes the ultimate indictment of modernity itself: proof that prosperity, growth and technological progress were mistakes. Gad Saad’s notion of suicidal empathy yields insights into the intellectual power of the climatistas among Western intelligentsia. Suicidal empathy refers to a pattern where an individual’s deep compassion for others becomes so extreme that it leads to self-harm, burnout or the undermining of the people they are trying to help. In Saad’s words, it refers to “the inability to implement optimal decisions when our emotional system is tricked into an orgiastic, hyperactive form of empathy, deployed on the wrong targets”. The empathy for ‘people and planet’ that forms the backbone of the climate narrative had led Western policymakers to prioritise abstract moral posturing over concrete human outcomes. It is this mindset that allows Western elites to congratulate themselves on decarbonisation targets while energy poverty rises, industries flee and living standards stagnate. The victims of these policies — the coal miners, factory workers and rural households — are dismissed as collateral damage or, worse, as morally suspect ‘deplorables’. The logic of climate alarmism encompasses the familiar phenomenon of Bootleggers and Baptists: the high priests of climate virtue including the juggernaut of lavishly funded environmental NGOs provide the moral cover, while a well-connected cohort of crony capitalists harvest subsidies, mandates and guaranteed returns. Wind and solar developers, ESG financiers and asset-management behemoths such as BlackRock have every incentive to keep the crisis narrative alive. The rhetoric of sacrifice is always for others; the rents are very much for themselves. Climate policy, with its fixation on targets detached from engineering and economics, fits this pattern all too well. This is why Trump’s challenge to climate orthodoxy was so destabilising. It was not merely a policy shift; it was a moral counter-revolution. By insisting on energy abundance, national interest and economic realism, Trump and his A-team in the energy and environmental patch – Energy Secretary Chris Wright, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin and Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum – have punctured the sanctimony of the climate elite. Executive orders can be reversed, but ideas are harder to kill — and that is precisely why the backlash has been so ferocious. No Time for Complacency Yet complacency would be a grave mistake. The perceived moral high ground remains firmly occupied by the Church of Climate, and it confers enormous political power. Should Trump’s movement falter — if the midterms deliver a repudiation rather than reinforcement, and if the next Presidential elections are lost by the MAGA movement — the entire edifice of Net Zero dogma could snap back with renewed vengeance. Democrats, buoyed by mainstream media amplification and deep-state entrenchment, would reinstate green mandates, reversing Trump’s gains. The administrative state, the ESG complex and the transnational climate bureaucracy have not gone away. They are waiting in the wings. The lesson of the past decade is sobering. Empirical truth, by itself, is not enough. Ideas matter, but so do moral narratives, institutional incentives and cultural coherence. Climate alarmism has proven resilient precisely because it is not a theory but a worldview — one that flatters its adherents, rewards its enforcers and immunises itself against doubt. If there is to be a genuine reckoning, it will require more than cheaper gas or failed wind farms. It will require reclaiming the moral language of human flourishing, exposing the hubris of central planning, and reasserting the primacy of evidence over piety. Until then, the climate apocalypse will remain postponed — but endlessly proclaimed.

Type your email… Subscribe wow the most comprehensive summary I have seen – but take heart – Trump is also bankrupting the climate NGOs as well so their noise will subside but as a former head of the UNIPCC stated- the real goal of the climate movement is the destruction of capitalism- so it will never go away as long as there are communist in charge of governments bankrupting the climate NGOs What was built once can always be rebuilt. True, except that the Church of Climate is losing adherents. And for the most part, they aren’t coming back. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. “There’s an old saying in Tennessee—I know it’s in Texas, probably in Tennessee—that says, fool me once, shame on—shame on you. Fool me—you can’t get fooled again.” I really liked GWB, it’s a shame his personality didn’t translate well to the job. Are they really? The true adherents are loyal and will remain loyal, since loyalty was the only thing they ever had — loyalty to the propagandists. The adherents weren’t smart enough to do their homework, research the facts, listen to the debates. They still don’t know jack about climatology, or the Ice Ages, or electricity, or anything technical. They only know being part of the herd. They will never abandon their caste. And their leaders will ride them over the cliff. It’s a Jim Jones cult. Sort of like “from the river to the sea” without being able to identify either. overall great article, but the claim that Trump is running a moral counter-revolution is absurd. The dude wants to absorb Greenland for no other reason that it’s easy and has never tried to take the moral view on anything. he could on some topics, but it seems he regards himself as a dirty exploitative manipulator. So, the dire predictions about the green comeback in the US will probably become reality. I hope the solution will come from a change in EU. He wanted to buy Greenland, not adsorb it, whatever that it in your mind. The US considered many times during many different administrations, beginning in 1867, to make this purchase. President Trump wanted to do this to improve the defense of the US from Russia and for other reasons. Don’t look at a map to see the defense issue, look at a globe. It may then be clear to you, or perhaps not. TDS? And how. But this is what we face: a large percentage of the populace that knows nothing about anything. They don’t think for themselves. They are easily swayed by propagandists. They are sheeple with a variety of insecurities, many induced by fear p*rn merchants. We can only hope that with patience and tough love that someday some of them will catch a clue. Brainwashed sheeple. Greenland, Iceland, and the Seward Peninsula are the increasingly important strategic zones of commerce/military choke-points. Russia is opening military ports on it’s northern coastal areas. the Greenland Sea is the main channel of Northwest Passage shipping traffic. China has already tried to buy military access to Greenland. With only 60k residents, and some of the poorest people on Earth, this is easily bought. Perhaps you want to place the country which jails people for Wrong-Think in charge of global commerce, or perhaps rethink that option. Adding Greenland would be the coolest maneuver in my lifetime. I want to take back all the trillions spent defending Europe, invading the Middle East and molding Hillary’s hairdo’s and use it to buy Greenland instead. You are one sick puppy! The US is vulnerable to attacks over the North Pole. Best you put away your illogical, mentallly-corrupt TDS and look at reality. “the claim that Trump is running a moral counter-revolution is absurd.” Your complete disconnect from reality is the only thing that is absurd here. Trump is systematically dismantling globalist subjugation of nation states. He was elected in a landslide to eliminate government mandated woke indoctrination and bring common sense and merit back as the governing principles for human development. It might be the most significant counter revolution in American history policy wise. Well Trump is a counter-revolution to the crazies and their jester puppet who they flicked for the word salad woman when the gaslighting so obviously couldn’t continue. A return to normalcy when the crazies had lost the plot completely even working out how many human genders there are (Hint: it’s the same number if you want to try and change genders Dr Mengele) The only morality involved was exposing the lie you couldn’t stop villains pouring across the southern border plus MSM lying complicity and ferretting out the worst of the slushfunding and snouts in the taxpayer trough. With hindsight what was so hard about that except the crazies squealing like stuck pigs their slops weren’t so forthcoming anymore. “the claim that Trump is running a moral counter-revolution is absurd” There is a certain validity to that comment. I do not believe Trump is motivated to a moral counter-revolution. Trump is a business man, not a politician, and reasonably adept at making deals. Most people do not bother to consider that his words and actions are tactical. What the future brings, is unknown, in planetary energy systems, national/world politics, none of it. Beer and popcorn time. I agree. People are putting far too much faith in the Trumpster. He only has a few more years left in office and the opposition are going to wait him out. Then it’s business as usual. Personally, i don’t think the Trumpster can change the course of america in 3 years. I could be wrong. Let’s hope so. From the article: “The administrative state, the ESG complex and the transnational climate bureaucracy have not gone away. They are waiting in the wings.” That’s right. In the U.S., Republicans need to keep the majority in the U.S. House, otherwise, the Democrats will be in a position to hold up a lot of progress on Trump’s agenda. I think soon it will be obvious to even the most dense that the U.S. economy is booming and prices are coming down and will continue to come down. Gasoline prices are down to $2 a gallon in many places. Reducing the cost of gasoline by $0.80 per gallon adds about one percent to U.S. GDP growth. It also puts more money in consumers pockets as they spend less for gasoline, they can use that money to spend in another area of the economy, thus stimulating that area. Things are looking real good in the U.S, as the economy is growing at a 4.3 percent annual rate. It took Trump less than a year to turn things around and get the U.S. back on the right track. None of this would be happening if a Democrat had been elected president. The U.S. would probably be in an economic recession right now, had that happened. But, the Good Lord smiled on us. 🙂 Unfortunately, the Marxist do-gooders are always doing everything they can to shield their herded masses from any improvements in prosperity since they require “victims” to justify their actions (thus the insistence on programs and policies that hurt the poorest the most), and instead of being the vigilant exposers of corruption, the news media are divided into camps of apologists for their chosen champions. Add to that the fickle, changing with the wind “moderate center”. It is they who will decide where the power resides in the next year. Donald Trump remains his own worst enemy in that regard, since one ill-considered stumble at a critical moment can turn that inconstant element against him. Such is the nature of the identity politics morass in which we are mired. Echo chamber disconnects from reality define the left. If Republicans don’t maintain control of congress we are screwed. They have zero understanding about how things work in the real world. Virtue signalling and hate are all they have. The Republicans are not helping the cause. Too many are reverting into RINOs, probably because the inducements from lobbyists are too sweet to pass up. Our political class is a mess. We need new leaders with integrity and common sense. I think Republicans will probably hold the majority in the U.S. Senate after 2026. If the U.S. House goes Democrat, it will cause a lot of problems for Trump, but it won’t stop the economy from booming, and it won’t stop Trump’s agenda, although it may slow it down. I think the U.S. economy is going to be booming during this next year and things will look a lot better between now and then, as far as prices and other Democrat talking points are concerned. The Republican Congress should codify as much of Trump’s MAGA agenda into law as possible before the 2026 elections roll around. Just in case. 🙂 The U.S. Senate can pass Trump’s MAGA agenda under the reconciliation rules, where they don’t need 60 votes to pass the bill, just a majority. It is my understanding that they can do reconciliation votes two more times before the 2026 elections. I hope the US continues in the right direction and succeeds in recovering in energy. Most western nations are adamantly headed for the cliff. The leaders of the Western Democracies can’t tell the difference between speculation and established facts. If they could tell the difference, they would see that all this demonization of CO2 is just speculation and would not be bankrupting their nations over a Climate Crisis that has not been scientifically established as fact. “heading for the cliff” A verifiable tipping point. I agree indicators are good. News does not want to report that things are getting better so have to focus on 20-year old scandals. Can they hide it another 3 years? Just hoping no big places decide it’s a good time to invade any little places and that no bankers collapse. “Can they hide it another 3 years?” No doubt they will try. 🙂 And yes, there are still a lot of challenges ahead, but at least we have someone with common sense leading the U.S now. We need a problem solver and Trump is a problem solver. He’s trying to fix the accumulated problems of the last 50 years. And they need fixing. The media points to grasshoppers to keep reads clicking. The next biggie is what? Wait for it…. The problem is that the blue states are not seeing much improvement in economics and living conditions due to state Democrat policies. It is up to the GOP to hammer home that the red states are doing well but the Democrat miasmas are still stagnant due to Democrat policy. I agree. Some of that kind of reporting is starting. I saw several reports on Fox News comparing costs in Red States verses costs in Blue States. The Red State costs were lower. The Trump administration needs to make a big, public relations effort to refute the Democrat propaganda. And I think they intend to do so. Trump has already given two public speeches in an effort to refute the talking points of the Democrats. I saw a great chart of inflation since the first Trump administration. The inflation rate for Trump 2016 was colored red and was around 3 percent, then the portion of the chart representing Biden’s term was colored blue and showed inflation shooting up like a rocket, and then Trump’s second term shows red again, and the inflation rate is back down to around three percent (2.7 percent as of the last reading). Looking at the chart, it is obvious that the price of things skyrocketed during the Biden years. And of course, the lying Democrats want to blame Trump for the high prices. It is SO disingenuous, but that’s the Democrats for you. They have no problem lying when the truth is obviously different. They depend on the Leftwing Propaganda Media to prop their lies up. EU did not “slash” any emissions, stop repeating their lies. But they did wreck their economies in the attempt! Are destroying, not did. The Wall Street Journal reported…. That shows how reliable that media, erm, propaganda organization is. Well written article, inciteful, and so true! 2026 should be very interesting as rival factions clash. Popcorn please! I wouldn’t call what is about to happen “interesting; I’d call it frightening. If the left continues with their obstructionist behavior, we will approach the possibility of civil war. Those who don’t want to see our country moved to the extreme left and threatened by increasing lawless acts of terrorism are rapidly growing weary, even exhausted, by those threats. It seems to be escalating and simply can’t go on, as is, much longer. We are already engaged in a civil war. We are a nation divided. If you do not agree with the position and recite the rhetoric verbatim you are a denier, the enemy. No middle ground. No dispassionate, mature debate allowed. Those wishing an open debate are silenced. Every issue has valid points on both sides, but only one side is allowed a voice. Popcorn, but do not forget the beer. We need MORE CO2. Very good article. Just have to comment on the photo – seems ER is in serious decline when they have to resort to dressing up dudes in Handmaiden costumes. Perhaps fitting that their protests now feature clowns. Can anyone still take them seriously? It should be rather embarrassing for a man to be dressed in that manner. “dudes in Handmaiden costumes” I took note of that myself. I said to myself: That’s not a gal there, he has a beard. I wondered why he was there dressed like that. I suppose he could be trans, Odd. Such a different world we live in now. I pity the children trying to make sense out of all this. It’s a lot tougher now. But it can be done. You can’t take people like this seriously. I can’t imagine the thought processes going on in those heads. Dazed and Confused, comes to mind. Sadly the children are not allowed to try to make sense of this. Rather, they are being told what to believe and not taught how to think. That applies not only to the children, but to the general population. We are all being inundated with Leftwing Propaganda 24 hours a day. Best article I’ve read on the Church of Climate, with its manipulative – corrupt Priesthood and useful idiot zealot followers. This line perfectly summed up their dogma; “ In this worldview, the legacy of Western development — from the Age of Exploration onward — is not human flourishing but original sin.” The Church of Climate will have people. They shall be known as Climengelicals. And I thought they were Climinupyourassholes. Quite often Ridicule is the best weapon… Sometimes you simply have to point and laugh!!! I add my kudos to the author of this essay on a very well written piece. Net Zero, renewables and their benefactor, the Church of Climate Alarmism, all benefit from the fact that the alarmist narrative is not a formally organized or recognized religion or church in the usual sense of the words. Thus, they are able to escape the separation of church and state mandated in the U.S. Constitution. This benefit helps them receive financial support at taxpayer expense with too little objection from the latter, although Trump now appears to be a threat to that financial support. The trolls here at WUWT ignore the problems with wind and solar energy involving physics, toxic waste, and other matters. Thus, they provide the evidence of the religious and cult-like nature of so-called renewable energy. The same goes for the climate narrative itself—the disconfirming science that shoots down the scare doesn’t matter anymore. Anyone promoting the disconfirmation is guilty of heresy and Orwellian thought-crime. It is fortunate heretics aren’t burnt at the stake anymore. And anyone familiar with the novel knows what happened to Winston Smith in Orwell’s 1984. The excessive amounts that electricity that users in the UK, Germany, California and elsewhere must pay on their bills can be viewed as tithes to this church. These tithes are the punishment for the sins of all of us against Holy Mother Earth and her climatic and environmental systems. Never mind that the Earth is getting greener. The decisions of the High Priests are final. I too worry that that climate alarmism will make a roaring comeback if the Democrats retake the U.S. Congress in 2026 and/or the White House in 2028. As much as I would prefer not to say this, never underestimate the ability of the U.S. voter to make bad decisions. The alarmists are like a predator just waiting in the wings to pounce on its prey when the opportunity presents itself. This is what could potentially happen when too little or no effort is made to educate the masses on the problems with renewables and the climate scare. Most of them probably don’t care enough to look into the issues themselves anyway. We will just have to wait and see what happens. Underlying all of this is an excessively high level of arrogance, egotism and misallocated self-righteousness found in the High Priests and believers that are probably nothing new in human history. MERRY CHRISTMAS AND HAPPY NEW YEAR TO ALL. Trump was a putz first term for not allowing Happer to do the red team/blue team debate about climate. If people knew the facts ideological zealots would be relegated as laughing stocks to be shamed for their idiocy. I have to wonder. With all the different life forms on this planet, can Mother Earth be considered a virgin? Excellent ! I’ve linked it on my https://cosy.com/DailyBlog.html with rare 4 * , and key quote : ” the seductive promise of meaningfulness “ Great article! Shame is the only way I can see the ideological disconnects from reality being broken. Their egoistic belief in the nobility and superiority of their position is impossible to influence because ideology has replaced reason. Why reason doesn’t work on them. The sheer idiocy of their beliefs needs to be called out at every opportunity. Climate denier shaming keeps them in their lane so maybe calling them climate idiots could get their egos to wake up. Shame augmented with ridicule. I caught this typo (corrected here) in the last sentence of the first paragraph under the sub-heading “Climate as Theology” in the above article: “. . . This durability is not rational. It is moral amoral, ideological and ultimately theological.” Otherwise, a great article! The Package Deal I’ve been noticing this for ages. Any “progressives” that don’t sign on to the “whole package” are committing sacrilege, risking excommunication from “the movement”. Very nice Tilak. This is what I have been saying though not nearly as eloquent as you. We don’t have a climate problem, we don’t have a science problem we do have a government problem. Government at all levels need to be called out for lying and cheating. As I have said before take away the strong arm of government and the problem goes away. It is that simple. The fanatics pushing CAGW are completely powerless and meaningless without the force of government. Take away the strong arm of government and these guys would be forced to defend their fanatic declarations with actual science and the observations to prove it. They have nothing and no one knows that better than them. On one level, this climate thing has a religious flavour. Have you noticed how religions use logic when it suits them, and dogma when it doesn’t. You can have a logical discussion with a believer up to a point, but you can never take it past that point. It would be good if the same did not occur in science, but as Max Planck and others have pointed out, it has gone on for centuries. It used to be called gatekeeping, but climate scientists have used the opaqueness of models to take it to a whole new dimension. In science, at least the facts can get through in the end, albeit often decades late. That is why, as others have pointed out, Net Zero is being separated from climate science. Both are crumbling, but in different ways. If connected, when one falls they both fall. By separating them, the blob (for want of a better word) hope they can save at least one. There is still a lot of hard work ahead – the honest people now have to fight on two fronts. There have always been fashions in thought, just as in everything else, including clothing, architecture, and building and automotive design. It is never rational, but the adherents follow it nonetheless, no matter how ridiculous it makes them look. The now-collapsing thinking regarding so-called “climate change” and the degree to which it is apocalyptic is just another example of this human weakness. There are many champagne socialists among the climate alarmists; in fact, few people would be surprised to find that they dominate the movement. They have little to lose by espousing the CAGW theory and many stand to profit from it either through career advancement and/or financially. So as long as their beliefs are being questioned or being abandoned completely, they will fight like tigers to keep propping them up because the stakes are too high not to do so. You can understand a lot of liberalism by recognizing liberals’ deep need to feel superior — intellectually, but also morally. Maybe there is medical hope for them after all. story tip Why some people keep making the same bad decisions | ScienceDaily “…the world’s most viewed climate website” – Fred Pearce The Climate Files: The Battle for the Truth about Global Warming “…invaluable” – Steven F.

Bitcoin's tumultuous year saw regulatory embrace, miner crises, and Wall Street's long-awaited entry into the crypto realm. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate.

The year began with political momentum and drifted into a summer of aggressive policy signals. Yet, it snapped into one of the sharpest boom-to-bust sequences in the asset’s history. By December, the price had round-tripped, leaving the asset flat for the year. But the flat chart masked a violent transformation underneath. While Wall Street banks finally opened their doors and ETFs vacuumed up record capital, the network’s physical infrastructure faced a solvency crisis. CryptoSlate has compiled some of the major trends that defined the market in 2025 below: President Trump moved from election promises to execution. On March 6, the White House signed Executive Order 14233, formally establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR). The US considers untapped financial resources, like tariff revenues and gold revaluation, to fund Bitcoin acquisitions. The order consolidated forfeited federal bitcoin holdings into a dedicated US Digital Asset Stockpile, ending the era of sporadic auctions by the US Marshals. A week later, lawmakers introduced the BITCOIN Act of 2025 to codify this framework. This legislation transformed the US government from a net seller into a strategic holder, signaling to global sovereigns that Bitcoin is a recognized reserve asset. Following this lead, states like Texas and Pennsylvania launched similar initiatives. Internationally, France, Germany, the Czech Republic, and Poland began exploring sovereign accumulation. In the corporate sector, the “Bitcoin Treasury” trend accelerated. Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) and over 100 other public companies now hold more than 1 million BTC on their balance sheets, according to Bitcoin Treasuries data. Sam Callahan, the director of Strategy and Research at Oranje BTC, explained that these entities embraced BTC because it “is a superior reserve asset to gold.” According to him: “Bitcoin is digital. Bitcoin is fully auditable in real time, and can be transferred instantly. Bitcoin has an absolute fixed supply. Gold’s supply will continue to expand, forever, from ongoing mining.” Another major milestone that defined the year was the traditional financial regulatory environment that shifted to accommodate Bitcoin. Over the past year, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and its sister financial organizations, such as the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), have made significant regulatory progress that has enshrined Bitcoin into the traditional financial system. For context, the CFTC approved Bitcoin as a valid margin in regulated derivatives markets, and the US Federal Housing also recognized the top crypto as an asset for mortgage qualification in the United States. However, the most significant changes came from the banking regulators, which fully embraced Bitcoin. FSOC dropped Bitcoin from its vulnerabilities list in 2025, coordinating with the GENIUS Act and OCC bank charters to normalize institutional access. Earlier this month, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) issued Interpretative Letter 1188. This document clarified that national banks can execute “riskless principal” crypto transactions. Previously, banks hesitated to broker trades because they did not want to hold volatile assets on their balance sheets. A “riskless principal” trade solves this. It allows a bank to buy an asset from a seller and resell it to a buyer immediately. The bank facilitates liquidity but never holds market risk. This letter, combined with conditional charter approvals for firms like BitGo, Fidelity Digital Assets, and Ripple National Trust Bank, effectively integrated crypto into the US banking stack. Due to these regulatory milestones, banks that hitherto treated Bitcoin as a reputational risk have changed their stance. In 2025, they began fighting for market share. Notably, CryptoSlate previously reported that 60% of the top 25 US banks now pursue strategies to sell, safeguard, or advise on Bitcoin. This shows that major financial institutions like PNC Bank, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan, and others opened their operations to enable Bitcoin trading and custody for interested clients. PNC's agency model with Coinbase spotlights a secure path for Bitcoin adoption amid complex regulations. Considering this level of growth, Bitcoin analyst Joe Consorti argued that BTC had become “too big for Wall Street to ignore.” Away from the banks embrace of Bitcoin, the Bitcoin exchange-traded fund market also provided strong performance for industry players this year. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) dominated the ETF landscape. This year, IBIT has attracted over $25 billion in inflows, ranking it sixth among all US ETFs. Crucially, investors used Bitcoin differently from gold. While the SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) saw inflows as gold hit record highs, Bitcoin ETF inflows persisted even as BTC's price stagnated. Eric Balchunas, Bloomberg's ETF analyst, said: “IBIT is the only ETF on the 2025 Flow Leaderboard with a negative return for the year…That's a really good sign long term IMO. If you can do $25 billion in bad year imagine the flow potential in good year.” Indeed, BlackRock, the largest asset management firm in the world, had described BTC as one of this “year’s biggest investment themes.” Considering this, market analysts explained that investors treated Bitcoin as a structural accumulation play rather than a momentum trade. Bitcoin's evolution reflects in off-chain ETF growth and reduced on-chain activity despite decentralized roots. Meanwhile, other positive developments within the ETF complex saw the US SEC approve “in-kind” creations and redemptions for spot ETFs. This technical change enabled Authorized Participants (APs) to swap actual BTC for ETF shares, rather than first converting to cash. At the same time, the financial regulator also allowed options on IBIT to go live. This provided hedgers and basis traders with the necessary tools to manage risk, completing the institutional derivatives stack. Unsurprisignly, BTC's price action followed its own volatile script. In early October, Bitcoin broke resistance to set a new all-time high above $125,000. Bitcoin faces record institutional demand and macroeconomic uncertainty, key drivers converging to push it to new highs. While the government and ETFs bought, long-term holders sold. On-chain data showed that wallets holding Bitcoin for 155 days or more contributed heavily to the October rally. This distribution, combined with macro-deleveraging, drove prices back under $90,000, which represented an over 30% correction. Meanwhile, global macroeconomic conditions complicated the picture. The US economy has seen significant Federal Reserve rates cut this year, with some arging that these moves were a positive for BTC price performance. However, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) simultaneously inched rates higher, tightening global liquidity and squeezing speculative carry trades. Japan's monetary shift scrutinizes yen's role in crypto trades, hinting at broader market challenges. Still, despite this market conditions, Bitcoin advocates believe the top crypto would shine. Pierre Rochard, the CEO of the Bitcoin Bond Company, said: “Bitcoin can be understood as a global “savings reservoir” for excess capital: when interest rates are low, liquidity is abundant, and high expected ROIC real investments are scarce, savings migrate into Bitcoin because it is a finite scarcity, a global digital open source network with a fixed 21 million supply.” While Wall Street integrated Bitcoin, the miners securing the network faced a crisis. Following the October peak, BTC's hashrate collapsed from a peak of 1.3 zetahash per second (zh/s) to 852 EH/S recently. It has recovered to 1.09 zh/s as fof press time. Hashrate is the lifeblood of Bitcoin security, which is used to drive the network trust. The higher the hashrate, the harder it is for any attacker to rewrite Bitcoin’s ledger. So, as BTC's price corrected below $90,000, older machines became a liability to Bitcoin miners. This is because the total cost to produce 1 BTC (including depreciation) for the average listed miner hovers near $137,800. With spot prices trading at a $47,000 discount to production cost, margins evaporated. To survive, miners pivoted to Artificial Intelligence (AI) and High-Performance Computing (HPC). Seven of the top ten miners now report revenue from AI contracts. Ranking the top Bitcoin miners by AI revenue and hashrate reveals how the industry’s leaders are redefining scale. Google emerged as a key financier in this shift. Rather than acquiring mining firms outright, Google provided credit support to help miners upgrade their infrastructure for AI workloads. This transition signals a permanent change in the industry: miners are evolving into hybrid energy-compute centers to hedge against Bitcoin volatility. Despite all of the institutional progress and positives of the past year, the psychological fears remained. 2025 was the year of integration. The “plumbing” is no longer theoretical. ETFs now function with in-kind efficiency, banks possess the regulatory clearance to trade, and the U.S. government formally holds the asset. However, the miner insolvency crisis and the LTH sell-off proved that structural adoption does not guarantee “up only” price action. Bitcoin is now fully exposed to the ruthless efficiency of macro markets. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

Skip to comments. Posted on 12/24/2025 10:01:09 PM PST by SeekAndFind Nvidia has agreed to buy assets from Groq, a designer of high-performance artificial intelligence accelerator chips, for $20 billion in cash, according to Alex Davis, CEO of Disruptive, which led the startup’s latest financing round in September. Davis, whose firm has invested more than half a billion dollars in Groq since the company was founded in 2016, said the deal came together quickly. Groq raised $750 million at a valuation of about $6.9 billion three months ago. Investors in the round included Blackrock and Neuberger Berman, as well as Samsung, Cisco , Altimeter and 1789 Capital, where Donald Trump Jr. is a partner. Groq said in a blog post on Wednesday that it’s “entered into a non-exclusive licensing agreement with Nvidia for Groq’s inference technology,” without disclosing a price. With the deal, Groq founder and CEO Jonathan Ross along with Sunny Madra, the company’s president, and other senior leaders “will join Nvidia to help advance and scale the licensed technology,” the post said. Groq added that it will continue as an “independent company,” led by finance chief Simon Edwards as CEO. Colette Kress, Nvidia’s CFO, declined comment on the transaction. Davis told CNBC that Nvidia is getting all of Groq’s assets, though its nascent Groq cloud business is not part of the transaction. Groq said “GroqCloud will continue to operate without interruption.” The deal represents by far Nvidia’s largest purchase ever. The chipmaker’s biggest acquisition to date came in 2019, when it bought Israeli chip designer Mellanox for close to $7 billion. At the end of October, Nvidia had $60.6 billion in cash and short-term investments, up from $13.3 billion in early 2023. In an email to employees that was obtained by CNBC, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said the agreement will expand Nvidia’s capabilities. (Excerpt) Read more at cnbc.com ...

Title: Nvidia Absorbs Another Rival for $20B, Boosting Decentralized AI
URL: https://beincrypto.com/nvidia-absorbs-rival-decentralized-ai/
Time Published: 2025-12-25T00:53:24Z
Full Content:
Written & Edited byOihyun Kim NVIDIA has agreed to pay approximately $20 billion to acquire assets from artificial intelligence chip startup Groq, marking the company’s largest transaction on record and continuing its strategy of absorbing potential competitors before they can challenge its market dominance. The chipmaker’s latest licensing deal mirrors a similar transaction just three months ago, reinforcing the narrative that decentralized AI infrastructure may offer the only alternative to Nvidia’s growing dominance. The deal closed just three months after Groq raised $750 million at a $6.9 billion valuation—a round that included BlackRock, Samsung, Cisco, and 1789 Capital, where Donald Trump Jr. serves as a partner. Nvidia is acquiring all of the company’s assets substantially, except its cloud computing business, though Groq framed the transaction as a “non-exclusive licensing agreement.” Groq CEO Jonathan Ross, a former Google engineer who helped create the search giant’s Tensor Processing Unit, will join Nvidia along with president Sunny Madra and other senior executives. The startup will continue operating independently under CFO Simon Edwards as its new chief executive. The Groq transaction follows a pattern Nvidia established just three months earlier. In September, the company paid over $900 million to hire Enfabrica’s CEO and employees while licensing the startup’s technology. Both deals use licensing structures rather than outright acquisitions, potentially avoiding the antitrust scrutiny that blocked Nvidia’s $40 billion bid for Arm Holdings in 2022. The Kobeissi Letter summarized Nvidia’s approach bluntly: “We will buy you before you can compete with us.” Nvidia's newest strategy:"We will buy you before you can compete with us."There has never been a company like Nvidia. https://t.co/wsbuAgIqyM Groq’s Language Processing Unit uses on-chip SRAM rather than external DRAM, enabling what the company claims is up to 10x better energy efficiency. This architecture excels at real-time inference but limits model size—a tradeoff Nvidia can now explore within its broader ecosystem. The timing is notable. Google recently unveiled its seventh-generation TPU, codenamed Ironwood, and released Gemini 3, trained entirely on TPUs, to top benchmark rankings. Nvidia responded on X: “We’re delighted by Google’s success… NVIDIA is a generation ahead of the industry—it’s the only platform that runs every AI model.” When incumbents start issuing such reassurance statements, competitive pressure is clearly mounting. While the deal has no direct impact on cryptocurrency markets, it reinforces the narrative driving decentralized AI computing projects. Platforms like io.net position themselves as alternatives to centralized AI infrastructure. “People can put their own supply onto a network, whether that’s data centers or yourself with your laptop, contributing your available GPU power, and getting fairly compensated for it using tokenomics,” Jack Collier, io.net’s Chief Growth Officer, told BeInCrypto. The platform claims enterprise clients, including Leonardo.ai and UC Berkeley, have achieved significant cost savings. However, the gap between narrative and reality remains wide. Nvidia’s acquisition of Groq’s low-latency technology further extends its technical lead, making it harder for any alternative to offer competitive performance. The transaction also raises questions about independent AI chip development. Cerebras Systems, another Nvidia competitor preparing an IPO, may eventually face similar pressure. Whether it can remain independent or succumb to Nvidia’s financial gravity remains to be seen.

Title: Rich like Bill Gates: Meet the Saudi sisters wielding $75 billion in a man’s world

We’re sorry, this feature is currently unavailable. We’re working to restore it. Please try again later. Add articles to your saved list and come back to them any time. When President Donald Trump feted Saudi Arabia’s crown prince at a state dinner last month, invitees included heavyweights like Apple boss Tim Cook and Citigroup’s Jane Fraser. Seated next to Elon Musk was Lubna Olayan, whose deep connections to both Wall Street and the kingdom marked her out as one of the most influential people in a room packed with luminaries. That White House banquet underscored the growing influence of the Olayan Group, a sprawling and secretive Saudi empire that Lubna and her sister Hutham have helmed for decades. The duo came of age at a time when women weren’t permitted to drive and needed a male guardian’s permission to even get a passport in the kingdom. Yet they’ve managed to steer the family conglomerate into a behemoth that operates at the scale of a sovereign wealth fund. Described as frank and outgoing, Saudi businesswoman Lubna Olayan has a reputation for being deeply involved with her family’s investments.Credit: Bloomberg The group controls a nearly $US13 billion ($19.6 billion) stock portfolio in the US, with stakes worth almost $US1 billion in BlackRock and $US1.5 billion in JPMorgan Chase, filings show. A large investor in Credit Suisse before its collapse, the conglomerate boasts a prime property portfolio that spans from Madison Avenue to central London. It has forged a large Dubai real-estate deal with Brookfield, and makes vast investments in private equity and fixed income. At home, it bottles Coca-Cola, runs Burger King outlets and services oilfields. Those bets have transformed the Olayan clan into one of the world’s richest families. Their fortune is valued at more than $US50 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, which is including them in its annual list for the first time. That figure doesn’t fully reflect the magnitude of their riches, according to people familiar with the matter, as the group discloses limited financial information. Many of them pegged the Olayans’ net worth well above $US100 billion, putting them in the same league as Bill Gates, Carlos Slim and Mukesh Ambani. ‘Normally we don’t seek the limelight…especially anything splashy. We avoid excess, and we are pretty frugal.’ That makes the Olayans richer than Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, the royal known as Saudi Arabia’s Warren Buffett. Their influence extends well beyond that financial firepower, aided in part by a loyalty to Saudi Arabia during tough times that’s made the group an indispensable national fixture, people familiar with the matter said. The extent of the Olayans’ reach often has Wall Street bosses reaching out for advice as they race to expand in Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s nearly $US1.3 trillion economy. “MBS continues to be drawn to the US as preferred partner in security and economic development,” said Steffen Hertog, a professor at the London School of Economics and Political Science. “Having private interlocutors with close links to US finance is useful.” A US-based representative for the Olayan Group didn’t comment and directed all requests to a Saudi-based spokesperson, who didn’t respond to a detailed list of questions. Most global executives are reluctant to speak about the family for fear of offending the sisters, who are known to fiercely guard their privacy. This story is based on an analysis of the family’s investments, operating companies and filings of family-owned entities, as well as interviews with more than half a dozen people familiar with the group, who asked not to be named discussing information that isn’t public. Hutham and Lubna, both in their early seventies, were born in Saudi Arabia to Suliman Olayan. The patriarch was orphaned at a young age and started out working as a dispatcher for the predecessor company of Saudi Aramco, leveraging his fluent English. He mortgaged his house for $US8000 to win a pipeline contract, according to a profile in Time magazine, eventually launching the Olayan Group in 1947. From there, Suliman diversified aggressively, and the group went on to strike partnerships to sell Colgate toothpaste, Oreos and Coca-Cola in the kingdom. He bought US equities to use as credit with American banks and by 1980, his conglomerate brought in more than $US300 million in annual revenue, according to the Time profile. His globalist bent created a uniquely bi-national empire that the daughters were immersed in early. Both studied in the US and were given significant jobs in the family business on their return. After Suliman’s death in 2002, his son Khaled was named chairman of Olayan Group, but Lubna and Hutham helped run much of the family’s vast operations. Lubna led the Mideast-focused division and Hutham took charge of Olayan America. The sisters married foreigners and took on prominent roles — Lubna was the first woman elected to the board of a public company in Saudi Arabia in 2004. Even then, women’s rights were severely limited in the kingdom. Only in 2018 were women finally given the right to drive. In an interview with NPR in 2018, Lubna recalled the difficulty finding a ladies room in factories and boardrooms because there were usually no women. She began approaching government officials and executives for help boosting the female workforce — all the while being reminded to tread carefully and attempting to avoid confrontation. “So, you negotiate, you deal, you do this, you take and give,” she said in the interview about those early efforts. Along the way, the sisters developed reputations for being steely negotiators. Their ascent was aided by an ability to keep a low profile and the duo ensured their business was seen as supportive of the government’s aims. The group is now officially headquartered in Liechtenstein, with offices around the world, including in Athens, where Lubna’s lawyer husband has deep ties. Over the years, the family has gained a reputation for running a stringently professional organisation that’s sophisticated in its dealmaking at a level not typically seen at family offices. The Olayans are deemed richer than Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, the royal known as Saudi Arabia’s Warren Buffett.Credit: AP “The family was very conscious of incorporating corporate governance frameworks into their business, and they did it with a high level of professionalism,” said Josiane Fahed-Sreih, director of the Institute of Family and Entrepreneurial Business at Lebanese American University. In one sign of their influence, the Olayan family was untouched in 2017 when dozens of Saudi royals, former officials and businessmen, including Alwaleed, were detained at the Ritz-Carlton in Riyadh as the crown prince consolidated power and conducted an unprecedented national shakeup. Alwaleed, worth about $US17 billion these days, has made a comeback of sorts in recent years and his investment group has benefited from the kingdom’s construction frenzy. In the 1990s, the businessman was known for a flamboyant lifestyle, frequently pictured on a private yacht purchased from Donald Trump. The Olayans do things differently. “Normally we don’t seek the limelight…especially anything splashy,” Hutham said about the Olayan family in a speech to the Arab Bankers Association of North America in 2013. “We avoid excess, and we are pretty frugal.” Even so, there have been investing missteps. A longtime investor in Credit Suisse, they stuck by the bank even through its downturn, ultimately becoming one of the big losers in the turmoil that culminated with UBS Group’s discount purchase of the troubled lender. The losses were at a scale that could roil large financial firms, but one international executive recalls the collapse being treated as a relative non-event within the Olayan Group. The conglomerate continued to execute transactions and payments as normal during the period, the person said. Saudi National Bank, the Swiss lender’s top shareholder, was among firms that lost money on its investment and its chairman resigned in the aftermath. Meanwhile, the Olayans’ profile has only grown in the years since. Key to that are their relationships on Wall Street and within the kingdom, particularly as Riyadh has started to intensify pressure on foreign firms to invest more locally and help diversify the economy. Despite recent fiscal pressures, Saudi Arabia remains a lucrative market for the titans of global finance: Riyadh ranks as one of the biggest issuers of debt in recent years, while the kingdom’s wealth fund has shown an appetite for blockbuster deals like the recent $US55 billion transaction to take Electronic Arts Inc private. Lubna has close connections to BlackRock co-founder Larry Fink, among others, and was recently named co-chair of the US-Saudi Business Council alongside Citi’s Fraser. Hutham sits on the board of Brookfield, which ranks as one of the biggest private equity investors in the Middle East. This year, during Saudi Arabia’s Future Investment Initiative conference, often called Davos in the Desert, Lubna hosted a party in Riyadh that had top global financial executives and officials mingling over canapés and rice and lamb, according to one attendee. Their links run broader than just finance. The US equity investments their father started to amass in the 1960s have grown to $US12.7 billion. These days, the portfolio includes stakes in Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon. By comparison, Saudi Arabia’s $US1 trillion wealth fund owns just over $US19 billion in US stocks. The group’s private equity portfolio forms another large chunk, and is estimated to run into the tens of billions of dollars, according to people familiar with the matter. Compounded annual growth rate for direct investments has exceeded 30 per cent over a 10-year period, according to its website. The firm’s real-estate holdings span more than 40 million square feet and 40,000 apartments under management. At home, the Olayans have backed the kingdom’s biggest efforts. When Saudi Aramco’s $US25 billion IPO struggled to attract international investors in 2019, the Olayan family was among those tapped locally by the administration of MBS — as the de facto ruler is called — to shore up demand. Lubna Olayan has successfully navigated the obstacles for women in the Saudi business world. “You negotiate, you deal, you do this, you take and give,” she says.Credit: Bloomberg At the same time, the sisters have managed a careful balancing act with their public comments. In 2018, as much of Wall Street avoided the kingdom’s FII conference after Saudi agents murdered columnist Jamal Khashoggi, Lubna used the start of a panel discussion to mourn his death, saying that the act ran counter to Saudi values. “We are very grateful that the terrible acts reported in recent weeks are alien to our culture and our DNA,” Lubna said in her address. These days, Lubna is chair of the Olayan Group’s corporate board, according to a recent press release from the US-Saudi Business Council. Hutham chairs the shareholders’ board, the group’s website says. Day-to-day operations are mostly managed by the likes of Chief Executive Officer Hani Lazkani and Chief Operating Officer Samer Yaghnam, people familiar with the matter said, though the sisters remain the public face of the group and helm broad strategy with family members. Multiple people described Lubna as frank and outgoing, with a reputation for being deeply involved with her investments. Like her father, she’s worldly and warm but also incisive, said James Zogby, president of the Arab American Institute and a friend of the late Suliman. “If you talk with her about current events, it’s not just, ‘This happened.’ She understands why things are moving the way they are.” Hutham, meanwhile, appears soft-spoken and grandmotherly in conversation, but her line of gentle questioning can elicit small details that can serve as fodder for the negotiating table, according to one international executive. The sisters are among the few people who understand the true extent of their sprawling business in its entirety, and tightly control its financial details. There have been moments in past years when a listing of an operating business seemed imminent, but deals haven’t materialised. Meanwhile, much has changed for Saudi women in the workforce. In the past seven years, the kingdom has announced reforms allowing women to set up businesses without male consent and travel independently, and many now run private equity funds, trade stocks and work in factories. “We look for opportunities, even in adversity,” said Hutham in her 2013 speech about her family. “We see silver linings.” Bloomberg The Market Recap newsletter is a wrap of the day’s trading.

Title: The top 12 crypto winners of 2025: who got it right this year?

Why Solana, Zcash, and the Trump Administration defined 2025, and what their dominance means for 2026. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. If 2024 was the year of the crypto reawakening, 2025 was the year the plumbing finally got permitted. This year, the emerging industry entered January with tentative optimism and exited December with federal statutes. As a result, the narrative shifted definitively from “crypto as a casino” to “crypto as capital markets infrastructure.” During this period, volumes moved on-chain, policy moved into the White House, and major asset managers moved past their hesitation, as evidenced most starkly by Vanguard’s reversal earlier this month, which allowed crypto ETFs on its platform. With $9.3 trillion under management, Vanguard’s entry into crypto ETFs could usher tens of billions in new demand despite modest initial allocations. However, in a year defined by record-breaking flows and legislative victories, not everyone shared the spoils equally. The winners of 2025 weren’t just the assets that went up; they were the protocols, people, and products that fundamentally secured their place in the future of finance. Based on CryptoSlate's analysis, here are the 12 definitive winners of the year and why they mattered: There is no discussion of the crypto landscape in 2025 without acknowledging the sheer force of the US pivot. For years, the industry operated with one foot out the door, eyeing Dubai or Singapore. In 2025, the US slammed that door shut and locked everyone inside—happily. Considering this, the victory is shared between the jurisdiction itself and the catalyst at the top. The 47th President’s administration delivered on the industry's longest-held wish list in under 12 months, effectively re-onshoring the digital asset economy. Several Executive Orders backing digital assets set the tone, but the strategic victories were tactical. The signing of the GENIUS Act on July 18 provided the first federal definition for stablecoins, while the “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve” Executive Order in March signaled to sovereign wealth funds globally that digital assets were a matter of national security. Hines rejected the idea of a numeric target for Bitcoin federal holdings, saying the US wants as much as it can get. Crucially, by pushing a leadership change at the SEC and the CFTC, the administration cleared the “regulation by enforcement” fog. Essentially, Trump's actions have set the tone to make the US “the crypto capital of the world.” The premier vehicle for institutional access didn't just survive its sophomore year; it thrived despite BTC's poor performance. This was evidenced by BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) emerging as one of the top 10 US ETFs by inflows, outpacing traditional heavyweights such as the Invesco QQQ Trust and the SPDR Gold Trust (GLD). Away from the flagship digital asset, Ethereum spot ETFs cemented their status as the default on-ramp for wealth managers, rendering the “not your keys, not your coins” debate irrelevant for the suit-and-tie crowd. The pivotal moment came in September when the SEC approved **generic listing standards**. This technical but crucial policy win slashed the red tape for future products, removing the need for 19b-4 filings for every single new ticker. As a result, the market welcomed an avalanche of new products focused on other digital assets, such as Solana and XRP, which also delivered strong performance this year. Solana effectively shed its “beta” reputation in 2025, as the “fast but breaks” narrative is dead. At the same time, Solana pulled off the most difficult pivot in crypto this year by going from the “memecoin casino” to the “liquidity layer” of the global market. Kalshi and Polymarket just had their biggest month ever as Solana's memecoin share fell to cycle lows. We chart the flows and test the rotation thesis. While it maintained its cultural dominance, CoinGecko reported that Solana was the most-followed blockchain ecosystem globally in 2025 for the second consecutive year. The network is no longer just about speculative tokens; it is now where efficient capital lives. According to Artemis data, Solana has emerged as a fundamental liquidity layer, with on-chain SOL-USD trading volume exceeding the combined SOL spot volume on Binance and Bybit, two of the top three centralized exchanges by trading volume, for three consecutive months. Essentially, Solana has differentiated itself as the primary venue for execution-sensitive activity. It is no longer just competing with Ethereum; it is competing with Nasdaq. If Solana won on speed, Coinbase’s Layer-2 network, Base, won on distribution. By leveraging the US-based exchange's massive existing user base, Base became the sticky default for consumer apps and stablecoin experimentation. Coinbase aims to transform crypto wallets into super-apps, integrating trading, social media, and merchant services. Base proved that in 2025, distribution matters more than novel cryptography. It became the launchpad for “normie” crypto—consumer fintech apps that use crypto rails on the backend without the user ever knowing. It is the bridge between the chaotic on-chain world and the regulated safety of Coinbase. After years of legal purgatory, 2025 was the year Ripple and XRP were finally set free. The long-running battle between the firm and the SEC officially concluded with a final judgment that cleared the runway for institutional adoption. As a result, XRP's narrative shifted overnight from “litigation risk” to “liquidity engine,” driving its value upward and paving the way for the launch of the first Spot XRP ETFs in November. At the same time, the company behind it, Ripple, spent the year aggressively buying the plumbing of traditional finance. Ripple deployed over $4 billion in strategic acquisitions this year alone, most notably the purchase of prime broker Hidden Road, treasury management firm GTreasury, and stablecoin infrastructure provider Rail. Ripple raised $500M at a $40B valuation from Citadel and Fortress, but the capital went to equity, not XRP. A bigger Ripple doesn't automatically mean higher prices for XRP. These moves have effectively transformed Ripple from a “payments company” into a full-stack institutional powerhouse. The surprise comeback of the year was Zcash and the privacy sector as a whole. Emerging as the undisputed best-performing sector of 2025, privacy coins shed their “illicit” stigma to become the darlings of the post-surveillance economy. While Zcash led the charge, the momentum was sector-wide. Ethereum developers accelerated their privacy initiatives, while other privacy solutions finally gained mainnet traction. Institutional interest and network resilience guide Zcash's resurgence as regulatory landscapes shift. Moreover, the regulatory thaw was palpable as the SEC held formal meetings with privacy protocol leaders to discuss compliant architecture. Notably, that would have been unthinkable a year ago. Real World Assets (RWAs) moved from “pilot programs” to “critical plumbing,” heavily aided by a friendly SEC. The Commission’s shift away from hostile enforcement allowed major players to integrate these assets without fear of a Wells Notice. Banks once shunned crypto custody; now they’re racing to tokenize trillions in cash and securities. The quiet rebuild is underway, and it’s happening inside the balance sheets of Goldman, Citi, and BlackRock. The watershed moment was BlackRock’s BUIDL fund being accepted as off-exchange collateral on Binance. This blurred the lines between TradFi and the crypto market structure. By December, tokenized money market funds and T-bills had surpassed $8 billion in AUM, while the broader RWA market is around $20 billion. Moreover, traditional financial giants like BlackRock, JPMorgan, Fidelity, Nasdaq, and Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) are heavily banking on the sector to make the traditional financial sector more transparent and efficient. Like Paul Atkins, the SEC Chair, said: “On-chain markets will bring greater predictability, transparency, and efficiency for investors.” The “killer app” debate is over. Stablecoins are the rail. The sector's market cap breached $300 billion in October, while Ethereum-based stablecoin supply hit an all-time high of $166 billion in September. In fact, Token Terminal stated that the total number of stablecoin holders is at an all-time high of around 200 million. This shows that the sector's growth was driven by these assets' ability to settle instantly, 24/7, across borders. Meanwhile, legislative progress in the US, especially the passage of the GENIUS Act, provided the legal clarity for banks to enter the fray. Essentially, stablecoins are no longer just trading chips; they are becoming the settlement layer for global fintech. Jeremy NG, the founder of Open Eden, captured it best, saying: “Stablecoins have crossed the line from crypto plumbing to financial infrastructure.” On-chain derivatives crossed the credibility chasm as monthly volumes hit a record $1.2 trillion in October. This sector won because it successfully siphoned volume from centralized exchanges (CEXs) by offering self-custody and, frankly, better incentives. The rise of perp DEXs like Hyperliquid and Aster signals a maturity in DeFi market structure. Traders are increasingly comfortable leaving billions in smart contract risk to avoid counterparty risk. 2025 was the year event contracts entered the US mainstream as Kalshi and Polymarket, the two dominant platforms in the sector, printed record numbers this year. However, the headline winner is that several traditional financial institutions and crypto-native firms like Gemini and Coinbase have also thrown their hats into the nascent sector. Prediction markets have become Wall Street’s newest battleground, with Kalshi betting on regulation and Polymarket betting on decentralization—and both racing to turn real-world events into tradeable assets. This sector won because it bridged the gap between “gambling” and “finance.” With Polymarket also receiving a path forward via an amended CFTC framework, event contracts are moving from niche internet curiosities to regulated hedging instruments. While the US focused on legislation, Hong Kong focused on execution supremacy—and the data proves it. In Q3 2025, Hong Kong's ETP market officially overtook South Korea and Japan to become the third largest globally by turnover, with average daily turnover hitting HK$37.8 billion (+150% YoY). The city's strategy of regulatory clarity paid off in tangible exchange milestones. The VATP (Virtual Asset Trading Platform) regime matured from a “deemed-to-be-licensed” purgatory into a robust ecosystem. Hong Kong's new crypto initiatives target institutional capital amid competition with Singapore and Dubai. By mid-2025, the SFC granted full licenses to additional major global exchanges, bringing the total number of licensed exchanges to 11. This effectively funneled regional institutional liquidity into a compliant, bank-connected net, isolating unregulated players. At the same time, the city's Stablecoins Ordinance that came into force on Aug. 1, created a pristine sandbox that attracted over 30 applicants by the September deadline. The final spot on this list belongs to you—the cohort that stayed. Over the past grueling years, early believers were told that crypto was a fraud, a bubble, or a dead end. They endured the collapse of 2022, the regulatory chokehold of the Gensler years, and the boredom of 2024. In 2025, they were vindicated. This year wasn't just about “numbers go up”; it was about “thesis proved right.” Related ReadingSEC Chair Gary Gensler issues stark warning about crypto investing ahead of Bitcoin ETF decisionWith the SEC expected to imminently approve a Bitcoin ETF, Chair Gensler alerts investors to risks involved in crypto investments.

Title: How XRP Is Approaching A Structural Break That Could Change Everything

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. After years of compression, XRP is quietly approaching a moment where the market will see a true structural break. This breakout is about a high-timeframe setup where market structure is on the verge of shifting. It is also the potential resolution of a multi-year structure that has compressed prices, absorbed supply, and conditioned participants to underestimate what comes next. At the least expected time, XRP will print a legendary candle that will set a structural foundation and never move down. A crypto investor known as 24HRSCRYPTO noted on X that this move that is coming won’t be powered by retail hype, but by real economic activity on the XRP Ledger. When the altcoin begins to function as a settlement asset, volatility will become a liability, rather than a feature. Additionally, the payment rails, liquidity provisioning, and institutional settlement system will require price stability. A bridge asset referred to as a vehicle currency cannot swing 30-40% and still clear trillions in value. As volume and utility increase, XRP begins to transition from a speculative instrument into market infrastructure. Liquidity depth would be key to absorb shocks, while the price becomes anchored by demand. This is why the first candle isn’t a top, but the market repricing XRP’s role from a tradeable asset into a financial primitive. With new initiatives, XRP’s adoption is set to increase. Analyst X Finance Bull has revealed that RLUSD is the first US trust-regulated stablecoin launched by Ripple, issued natively on the XRP Ledger and extending across Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) chains for broader institutional access. Any banks that would integrate with RLUSD will be automatically onboarded into the XRP rails. This isn’t just about stable payments, but about demand generation for the altcoin as the default bridge asset. From BlackRock funds flow to global repo markets, that’s where the real volume begins to flow. This flips the game, allowing RLUSD to provide the liquidity, while XRP captures the movement. For the first time, XRP Ledger has now processed over 4 billion transactions since its launch in 2012. Co-founder of Tedlabsio, a crypto trader and investor, Niels, has pointed out that the real-world usage across the network has sustained more than 13 years of uninterrupted operation. The XRPL consistently handles around 1.5 million transactions per day, with regular peaks exceeding 5 million, and settles in 3 to 5 seconds. All of this happens at fractions of a cent per transaction. Over time, more than 13 million XRP have been burned in transaction fees, a metric that reflects continuous demand in network activity. This is why institutions pay attention to XRPL. My name is Godspower Owie, and I was born and brought up in Edo State, Nigeria. I grew up with my three siblings who have always been my idols and mentors, helping me to grow and understand the way of life. My name is Godspower Owie, and I was born and brought up in Edo State, Nigeria. I grew up with my three siblings who have always been my idols and mentors, helping me to grow and understand the way of life. My parents are literally the backbone of my story. They’ve always supported me in good and bad times and never for once left my side whenever I feel lost in this world. Honestly, having such amazing parents makes you feel safe and secure, and I won’t trade them for anything else in this world. I was exposed to the cryptocurrency world 3 years ago and got so interested in knowing so much about it. It all started when a friend of mine invested in a crypto asset, which he yielded massive gains from his investments. When I confronted him about cryptocurrency he explained his journey so far in the field. It was impressive getting to know about his consistency and dedication in the space despite the risks involved, and these are the major reasons why I got so interested in cryptocurrency. Trust me, I’ve had my share of experience with the ups and downs in the market but I never for once lost the passion to grow in the field. This is because I believe growth leads to excellence and that’s my goal in the field. And today, I am an employee of Bitcoinnist and NewsBTC news outlets. My Bosses and co-workers are the best kinds of people I have ever worked with, in and outside the crypto landscape. I intend to give my all working alongside my amazing colleagues for the growth of these companies. Sometimes I like to picture myself as an explorer, this is because I like visiting new places, I like learning new things (useful things to be precise), I like meeting new people - people who make an impact in my life no matter how little it is. One of the things I love and enjoy doing the most is football. It will remain my favorite outdoor activity, probably because I'm so good at it. I am also very good at singing, dancing, acting, fashion and others. I cherish my time, work, family, and loved ones. I mean, those are probably the most important things in anyone's life. I don't chase illusions, I chase dreams. I know there is still a lot about myself that I need to figure out as I strive to become successful in life. I’m certain I will get there because I know I am not a quitter, and I will give my all till the very end to see myself at the top. I aspire to be a boss someday, having people work under me just as I’ve worked under great people. This is one of my biggest dreams professionally, and one I do not take lightly. Everyone knows the road ahead is not as easy as it looks, but with God Almighty, my family, and shared passion friends, there is no stopping me.

Title: BlackRock strategists expect limited rate cuts in 2026 unless labor market cracks

Time Published: 2025-12-24T15:11:11Z

Share this article The Federal Reserve is expected to deliver limited rate cuts in 2026 unless there is a sharp deterioration in the labor market, according to BlackRock senior strategists Amanda Lynam and Dominique Bly. Their outlook reflects recent US labor market data, which point to modest softening but no sharp downturn. Although the unemployment rate rose to 4.6% in November, the highest since 2021, analysts noted that part of the increase was driven by higher labor force participation and government job losses rather than a fundamental weakening in labor conditions. From a policy standpoint, the Fed continues to view labor risks as balanced, according to BlackRock’s strategists. Recent data echo some downside concerns flagged by Chair Jerome Powell, but do not signal a major breakdown in employment conditions, they stated. With 175 basis points of cuts already implemented since September 2024 and policy rates approaching neutral, BlackRock sees limited room for aggressive easing in 2026. Further cuts would depend on a sharp labor market decline, which they do not expect. Sign in to your account Don’t have an account? Create one Create your account Already have an account?

Title: Expedia CEO Ariane Gorin on the fight to ensure AI doesn’t turn her brands into invisible pipes consumers never see

Good morning. The holidays feel like a good time to check in with Ariane Gorin, CEO of Expedia Group. 2025 has been a banner year for travel and for Expedia, which saw its revenues rise 7.6% to $13.4 billion in the 12 months ending Sept. 30, with its stock up more than 50% so far this year. In the latest episode of Fortune’s Leadership Next, Gorin spoke to me and Kristin Stoller about the evolving travel landscape and how she’s leading in this tricky climate. AI is reshaping the travel experience as many of us turn to large language models to plan and even pay for trips. That presents both an opportunity and a potential threat for leaders like Gorin—and Booking Holdings CEO Glenn Fogel, with whom we spoke earlier this year. The opportunity: to deploy AI internally and forge partnerships that embed the group’s Expedia, Hotels.com and Vrbo functionality within the LLMs. The risk: hallucinations, privacy violations, and the specter of LLMs reducing the need for travel sites or turning them into invisible pipes that consumers never see. “We’ve been working for years with Google and Bing … and now it’s about deepening our partnerships,” said Gorin, adding that AI has enabled innovation like Expedia’s new trip-matching feature that turns Instagram reels into bookable travel experiences. “It’s been quite fun to challenge ourselves to say, ‘how do we make sure that our brands are showing up well there?’” Gorin also talks about building up Brand USA among foreigners during this delicate time when former stalwarts (hello, Canada!) may be staying away and events from the World Cup to America’s 250th anniversary are expected to boost tourism. Her approach is to start with telling the story that Americans are “making it welcoming, that we’re making the infrastructure welcoming, we’re making it easy to come to the country.” That’s a message many leaders would love to rally around. You can listen to our conversation on Apple or Spotify. Also, the CEO Daily team is taking a break for the holidays. See you back here on January 5. As always, we welcome your thoughts and appreciate you reading what we write.Contact CEO Daily via Diane Brady at diane.brady@fortune.com U.S. sends more troops to the Caribbean Large numbers of ships, special-operations aircraft, troops, and equipment are being amassed by the U.S. military in the Caribbean in a buildup to a potential attack on Venezuela, which may include airstrikes on Venezuelan soil. “We have a massive armada formed, the biggest we’ve ever had, and by far the biggest we’ve ever had in South America,” President Trump said. “Soon we will be starting the same program on land.” Trump wants to force Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro out of office. Trump flew on Epstein’s plane more often than thought The U.S. Justice Department released thousands more documents related to Jeffrey Epstein, and many made mention of President Donald Trump. None of them describe wrongdoing. But one email, from an assistant U.S. attorney in the Southern District of New York, said flight records showed Trump used Epstein’s jet “many more times than previously has been reported (or that we were aware).” There are 700,000 more pages of Epstein material on the way—so expect the headlines on this issue to last another week. Epstein sought Wall Street giants as executors of his will The Epstein documents show that the late financier hoped that high-powered Wall Street execs would be the executors of his estate. He named Jimmy Cayne, the former CEO of Bear Stearns; Jes Staley, formerly of JPMorgan and an ex-CEO of Barclays, Goldman Sachs legal chief Kathryn Ruemmler, and former Treasury secretary Larry Summers as executors in various versions of his will. It is not clear that any of them knew they were named by Epstein. Big Tech companies have $120 billion in off-balance sheet debt Meta, xAI, Oracle, CoreWeave and others have moved $120 billion in spending on AI data centers off their balance sheets and into special-purpose vehicles or private credit entities funded by Pimco, BlackRock, Apollo, Blue Owl Capital , JPMorgan, and others, according to a Financial Times analysis. U.S. GDP fueled mostly by AI U.S. GDP grew 4.3% in Q3, far surpassing expectations, but most of that growth comes from one thing: AI data centers. Pantheon Macroeconomics said that private fixed investment—a measure of how much companies are spending—“is rising only due to AI-related spending.” All other private fixed investment is actually in decline. Deutsche Bank said, “Investment in AI-related sectors is critical to GDP growth [and the] U.S. would be close to recession this year if it weren’t for tech-related spending.” Trump Administration bans former EU commissioner from entering the U.S. Thierry Breton, the former European Union commissioner who backed the Digital Services Act, and four anti-disinformation campaigners have been banned from entering the U.S. “The State Department is taking decisive action against five individuals who have led organized efforts to coerce American platforms to censor, demonetize, and suppress American viewpoints they oppose,” Secretary of State Marco Rubio said. The DSA bans U.S. tech platforms from targeting users with data based on gender, race, religion, or age. Targeting children with ads will also be prohibited. It also requires platforms to take down content that incites terrorism or child sexual abuse. Progress in Ukraine-Russia peace talks Ukraine’s President Zelensky is hopeful he can persuade the U.S. to support a proposal that would halt Russia’s war along the current contact lines.

Title: Crypto Won In 2025—But Bitcoin Fell. Can They Rise to the Occasion?

The rise and subsequent retreat of bitcoin perfectly encapsulates the crypto industry's year. It won big—but it doesn't have much to show for it yet. The price of bitcoin, the world's most well-known cryptocurrency, soared above $126,000, a record, but those gains evaporated and it's poised to finish down for 2025. The industry welcomed the passage of stablecoin legislation, eased regulation, and the proliferation of new ways to buy in, but by many measures it has yet to reap the benefits. Despite all this, plenty of reasons for optimism regarding the both sector and the currencies themselves remain. Next year could be when the effects of institutional buy-in and regulatory shift will start to show, crypto watchers say. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) could break out of its rut to book new highs, experts say, while altcoins could get a regulatory boost. And interest in "tokens"—the digital representation of assets like the dollar or stocks—could take off, further extending the investing world into digital space. "If you talk to retail crypto, the vibe is extraordinarily negative. They look at their world, which extends out a few weeks in time, and see dark clouds—and so they're selling," Matt Hougan, CIO of Bitwise Asset Management told Investopedia. "And then if you talk to institutional investors, they're just unremittingly bullish." The crypto industry has said that regulation was holding back its potential and that it would upend and replace the existing financial system. Now that a crypto-friendly administration has paved the way, investors are waiting for some of those promised developments to be realized. Bitcoin's supporters see reasons for optimism in the broader outlook for markets in 2026. The prospect of lower interest rates is generally beneficial to risk assets and could both fuel retail appetite for and institutional investor interest in crypto. The coming wave of capital implied by major financial institutions like Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch offering access to crypto ETFs to their clients, and big university endowments like those of Harvard and Brown buying in, could also lift bitcoin next year, Hougan said. He expects institutional demand to outpace new supply in the years to come. Since crypto ETFs launched in 2024, they have bought more than 700,000 bitcoin, roughly twice the number of new coins produced by the Bitcoin network over the same period, according to a Bitwise report. The so-called debasement trade—in which investors seek hedges, such as crypto or other assets, against high government debt and a declining dollar—may also come back into play, drawing investor interest next year. "For individuals investing against or hedging their debasement risk, bitcoin makes a lot of sense," Amberdata's director of derivatives Greg Magadini said. Bitcoin's permabulls broadly expect prices to continue to go higher—if not next year, then by the end of the decade. Standard Chartered, for example, sees it hitting $500,000 by 2030. The nearer term outlook for the cryptocurrency, however, is muddier. Galaxy Digital, a financial services firm focused on digital assets, in its 2026 outlook said bitcoin will hit $250,000 by the end of 2027 but called next year "too chaotic to predict." (That generally tracks with the outlooks of some stock-focused analysts, who think the S&P could rise next year but perhaps not smoothly.) Enthusiasm for crypto has led related businesses to stock exchanges amid a revival in initial public offerings. Their collective performance was mixed: Stablecoin issuer Circle (CRCL) hit it big and retained some of its early-won gains, as did Bullish (BLSH). But shares of Winklevoss twins-founded crypto platform Gemini (GEMI) have fallen substantially below their IPO price. (A few well-known firms are eyeing a debut next year.) Strategy (MSTR), the software company that put itself on the map by stockpiling bitcoin, tumbled more than 45% year-to-date. The passage of the CLARITY Act, which provides a framework for regulating crypto in the same way the GENIUS Act did for stablecoins, could also support crypto. David Sacks, the White House's adviser on crypto and artificial intelligence, has said "we are closer than ever" to passing the bill. If the bill is signed into law, the outlook for crypto would improve, Hougan said, because it would enshrine the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, rather than the Securities and Exchange Commission, as crypto's oversight agency, considered the industry's preferred outcome. If it doesn't, a less crypto-friendly future administration might take a different approach. The CLARITY Act would set a more solid regulatory foundation for the industry to operate, according to Hougan, and potentially invigorate demand for altcoins like ether and sol. "It's the biggest risk to crypto right now," he said. "People are pricing in a higher probability that market structure legislation won't get passed." Tokens tied to real-world assets, like stablecoins or ones linked to stocks, could also fire up interest in crypto next year, with some crypto experts saying they can can improve the functioning of the financial system. Circle in 2025 saw its USDC stablecoin expand its reach, with its circulating supply jumping more than 50%, according to analytics firm rwa.xyz. SEC Chair Paul Atkins recently predicted that tokenization could transform the financial market sooner rather than later. "It's the way the world will be...maybe not even in 10 years, maybe even a lot less time, maybe a couple of years from now," Atkins told Fox Business. The tokenization of stocks, an opportunity potentially measured in the trillions of dollars, is being tackled by crypto players and at least one of the financial industry's juggernauts. Coinbase Global (COIN), the largest U.S. crypto exchange, which recently unveiled its own token platform (as well as stock trading), and BlackRock (BLK), the world's largest asset manager, have both made tokenization a strategic priority.

Title: ‘If I can help someone, I will’: the Dublin woman who has been providing Christmas dinners for 39 years

“I won’t be here forever and these people cannot be left without,” said Dubliner Margaret Brown, who has been providing Christmas dinners to those in need and the homeless for almost four decades. Mrs Brown, from Sandycove in south Co Dublin, has been organising the festive feast since 1986 after she and her late mother saw people in a scout hall eating lumpy soup and cold meat while huddled around a gas-fired heater. “Running out of turkey 39 years ago when I first started cooking dinners with my mother, I never thought I would be doing this all these years later,” she said. “But thankfully I can still do this; for how much longer I do not know.” Mrs Brown, who is in her 80s, originally organised her annual Christmas dinners in Blackrock Rugby Club in south Dublin. In the past, high-profile names such as rock band U2 have surprised guests at the annual Christmas dinner when people gathered at the rugby club. Then the Covid-19 pandemic changed everything and forced Mrs Brown and scores of volunteers to turn to making takeout meals instead. Now the new tradition of delivering the five-course feast of a full Christmas dinner, with pudding and mince pies, is here to stay. “I won’t be here forever, but I’ll keep making the dinners with the help of so many wonderful volunteers thanks to donations we receive from food producers,” said Mrs Brown. The numbers she is feeding have surpassed 200, which is normally the cut-off number she and her team can cook for. “The numbers we could provide for filled our list way in advance of the cut-off date,” she said. “There are so many new people, many of whom are younger, not just older individuals who are lonely and homeless, which is shocking.” The 39 years she has been feeding people has passed “in the blink of an eye” and the needs of people have changed in that time. “There have been a lot of changes in social needs over those years and food provisions have to meet those demands,” she said. The team of volunteers will be cooking for 60 people living in Bethany House for the homeless in Dún Laoghaire. There will also be a special meal for Travellers living in Carrickmines who lost several family members in a blaze 10 years ago. [ ‘So long as these people are here, we’ll never starve’: In the queue for Christmas vouchers at Dublin’s Capuchin Day CentreOpens in new window ] “It takes a lot of preparation in the lead-up to Christmas Day, receiving donations, streamlining of cooking times, delivering the food to people, or them calling to the rugby club at specific times and ensuring no one is forgotten,” said Mrs Brown. Her giving has not just been at Christmas. In 2019 she helped repatriate the remains of an Irishman, Joseph Tuohy from Toomevara, Co Tipperary, as he had no known relatives still alive, and helped prepare a funeral for him. Mr Tuohy, who died in his late 80s, was separated from his mother at age five and spent his childhood in orphanages and St Joseph’s Industrial School in Clonmel. He emigrated to London in his late teens and never returned to Ireland, losing contact with his family. He experienced periods of homelessness and illness in London. Mrs Brown was contacted about his case in her capacity as a volunteer for the Friends of the Forgotten Irish Emigrants, who launched an appeal to Mr Tuohy’s relatives and for people to attend his funeral. His ashes were subsequently laid in consecrated ground in Tipperary. “I didn’t set out for my life to be like this, or to become known for trying to help others, but life can be so difficult for so many and if I can help someone I will,” said Mrs Brown.

Title: Extended crypto ETF outflows shows institutions disengaging: Glassnode

Bitcoin and Ether ETFs have recorded sustained outflows since early November, which Glassnode says signals institutional disengagement. Cointelegraph in your social feed Bitcoin and Ether exchange-traded funds have seen a prolonged streak of outflows, indicating that institutional investors have disengaged with crypto, said the analytics platform Glassnode. Since early November, the 30-day simple moving average of net flows into US spot Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) ETFs has turned negative, Glassnode said on Tuesday. “This persistence suggests a phase of muted participation and partial disengagement from institutional allocators, reinforcing the broader liquidity contraction across the crypto market,” it added. Flows into crypto ETFs usually lag the spot markets for the tokens, which have been trending down since mid-October. The ETFs are also considered a bellwether for institutional sentiment, which has been a market driver for most of this year but seemingly turned bearish as the wider market has contracted. Coinglass said aggregate Bitcoin ETF flows have been in the red for the past four consecutive trading days. However, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has seen minor inflows over the past week. “Crypto ETF selling pressure is back,” the Kobeissi Letter said on Tuesday. It reported that crypto funds recorded $952 million in outflows last week, and investors have now withdrawn capital in six out of the last ten weeks. Related: BlackRock pins Bitcoin ETF as major theme alongside T-bills, tech stocks Despite the recent outflows, the industry-dominant BlackRock fund has seen $62.5 billion in inflows since inception, eclipsing all rival spot Bitcoin ETFs. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said on Saturday that IBIT is the only ETF on Bloomberg’s “2025 Flow Leaderboard” with a negative return for the year. “The real takeaway is that it was sixth place despite the negative return,” he added. Balchunas said that BlackRock’s flagship Bitcoin fund even took in more than the SPDR Gold Shares fund (GLD), which was up 64%.

Title: These Five Key Drivers Could Boost XRP To $5 By 2026, Claims Top Analyst

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. XRP, currently the fifth largest cryptocurrency by market cap, has recently fallen below the crucial $2 mark amid a broader market correction that has dampened investor sentiment since October. However, market analyst Sam Daodu has identified five critical catalysts that could drive the altcoin to new all-time highs of $5 by 2026. In a detailed report, Daodu emphasized that for XRP to reach $5, multiple specific factors need to work in unison. Each of these catalysts aims to address various barriers that have kept XRP’s price stagnant. At the forefront of Daodu’s analysis is the potential for a BlackRock-backed XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF). Since mid-November 2025, spot XRP ETFs have attracted over $1 billion in cumulative inflows. Should BlackRock move forward with its ETF, estimates suggest that inflows could exceed $2 billion. Daodu’s analysis points that such capital influx would not only reshape market demand but would also solidify XRP’s position as the sole cryptocurrency tied to a fully regulated token in the United States, significantly enhancing its case for reaching $5. Next on the list is the evolving significance of Japan within the XRP narrative. Ripple, in collaboration with SBI Holdings, is set to launch RLUSD—Ripple’s USD-backed stablecoin—in Japan by the first quarter of 2026, pending regulatory approval. The use of RLUSD on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) can create substantial demand for XRP as a bridge currency, supporting the case for it to reach $5, even if this impact unfolds gradually over time. The third catalyst that Daodu identified is the tokenization of assets. Ripple’s expanded partnership with Archax aims to bring in “hundreds of millions of dollars” in tokenized equity, debt, and funds onto the XRP Ledger by mid-2026. Should the XRP Ledger capture even a modest 5-10% of the tokenized asset settlement market, the demand for XRP would increase significantly, further supporting its goal of reaching $5. In fourth place, macroeconomic policy plays a crucial role in shaping XRP’s upside potential. Anticipated rate cuts by the Federal Reserve (Fed) would likely decrease returns on cash and short-term bonds, traditionally driving capital toward riskier assets that offer growth and liquidity. Lastly, recent on-chain data points to a noteworthy change in supply dynamics. Exchange-held XRP has decreased, with 1.35 billion XRP removed from exchanges in less than two months. Balances plummeted from approximately 3.95 billion tokens to about 2.6 billion, with more than a billion leaving in just a short span of three weeks. Such withdrawals are indicative of a behavioral shift among holders, as many are opting to move XRP into long-term storage solutions. Daodu posits that reaching the $5 mark will not stem from a singular headline or moment of exuberance. It will necessitate a convergence of multiple factors, including strong ETF inflows, institutional adoption, and favorable macroeconomic conditions. As of this writing, the altcoin was trading at $1.88, dropping by almost 50% from all-time high levels reached back in July of this year.

Two new exchange-traded funds from Amplify track companies building the infrastructure for stablecoins and tokenization, blending stocks and crypto. Cointelegraph in your social feed Digital asset manager Amplify has launched two exchange-traded funds tracking blockchain projects across stablecoins and tokenization. The company said on Tuesday that its Amplify Stablecoin Technology ETF (STBQ) and Amplify Tokenization Technology ETF (TKNQ) both went live on the NYSE Arca exchange. Both funds track a diversified index of companies working on products or infrastructure, along with projects that generate revenue from tokenization and stablecoins. “These new ETFs expand Amplify’s lineup at a time when the infrastructure behind stablecoins and the growth of tokenization are shaping the next phase of digital finance,” the company said. Stablecoins and tokenization have been among the most popular themes in crypto this year, with the US passing laws that have given institutions confidence to launch stablecoins, and regulators opening dialogue on how they should treat assets such as tokenized stocks. Amplify said its stablecoin-focused ETF tracks shares of companies “generating significant revenue from payments technology, digital asset infrastructure, and trading platforms.” It holds shares in companies working on stablecoins such as Visa, Circle, Mastercard and PayPal, alongside crypto ETFs from Grayscale, iShares and Bitwise. The firm pointed to regulatory developments in the US and EU, noting that the “GENIUS Act in the US and MiCA in Europe are positioning stablecoins as the compliant backbone of digital finance.” Related: Clarity Act delays led to $952M in crypto fund outflows: CoinShares Meanwhile, the tokenization fund includes exposure to BlackRock, JPMorgan, Figure Technology Solution, Citigroup and the Nasdaq, which all have made tokenization plays over the past few years as they seek opportunities to digitize traditional financial services.

JPMorgan is making another big bet on crypto. The Wall Street giant is considering letting institutional clients trade cryptocurrency, according to reporting on Monday from Bloomberg. These products and services may reportedly include spot and derivatives trading, and the efforts are still in their early stages. JPMorgan did not immediately respond to Fortune’s request for comment. The move comes amid the company’s broader embrace of digital assets. In October, the bank announced that it would allow institutional clients to use Bitcoin and Ether as collateral. And earlier in December, JPMorgan’s asset management arm launched its first tokenized money fund. The bank’s recent expansion of crypto is notable given how CEO Jamie Dimon has long expressed contempt for the sector. As recently as last year, Dimon compared Bitcoin to a “pet rock”, and said that its only uses were for money laundering and fraud, among other illegal activities. The remarks followed other insults Dimon has heaped on crypto over the years. JPMorgan’s pivot towards crypto follows President Donald Trump’s more favorable policies toward the sector. In July, Trump signed the Genius Act into law, creating a regulatory framework for stablecoins. The legislation was enacted as Trump’s family profited from the industry. Given the new regulatory landscape for crypto, other major financial companies have also been hopping on the bandwagon. BlackRock manages close to $100 billion in Bitcoin ETF assets and more than $11 billion in Ethereum ETFs. Meanwhile, fellow financial giant Fidelity is involved in crypto staking, while Goldman Sachs has a private blockchain that is testing tokenized fund redemptions. And UBS, Citi, and HSBC have participated in tokenized bond issuances, on-chain settlement pilots, and crypto custody services. Wall Street’s latest digital asset adoption has not, however, translated to big price wins for the major cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is down about 30% to roughly $87,000 since its high of $126,000 in early October. Ethereum is also down roughly 30% in the last three months to $2,919, and Solana is down roughly 43% to $123.07 during that same time period. It appears that the big banks are taking a long-term view on crypto and are not being scared off by this recent dip.

Title: Vanguard Exec Likens Bitcoin to ‘Digital Labubu’ Even as Firm Opens ETF Trading Access

Executive John Ameriks emphasized Vanguard’s core view of the crypto sector hasn’t changed, seeing the asset class as highly speculative. Vanguard’s global head of quantitative equity, John Ameriks, said bitcoin still resembles a speculative collectible more than an asset meant to build long-term wealth, comparing it to a “digital Labubu,” the plush toy that has become a popular collectible. Ameriks’ words came during Bloomberg’s ETFs in Depth conference in New York on Thursday, where he said bitcoin lacks the income, compounding, and cash-flow traits Vanguard seeks when it evaluates long-term investments. His dismissive stance comes as Vanguard just opened its platform to crypto exchange-traded funds, allowing its 50 million clients access to regulated investment vehicles from rivals like BlackRock and Fidelity. The asset management giant’s begrudging embrace of crypto is a reversal of long-time skepticism towards the entire asset class. For years, Vanguard stood against offering cryptocurrency products to clients, reiterating that it saw digital assets as highly speculative and unaligned with its core investment philosophy. That view, according to Ameriks, apparently hasn’t changed. As a result, Vanguard does not plan to launch its own crypto-focused ETFs. The decision is notable as bitcoin ETFs have become BlackRock’s top revenue source. Still, after Vanguard saw crypto ETFs and funds “have been tested through periods of market volatility, performing as designed while maintaining liquidity,” the firm opened its brokerage platform to these products. Even with that access, Vanguard will not advise clients on whether to buy or sell crypto assets or which tokens to hold, Ameriks said. Ameriks said bitcoin could eventually show non-speculative value in certain conditions, such as high inflation or political instability, but he argued the evidence is still limited. “You’ve still got too short of a history,” he said.

Title: Ethereum is vanishing from exchanges, and the massive wallets absorbing it prove you aren’t the target audience anymore

Exchange balances hit record lows and institutions control 11% of supply, but NFT sales cratered 87% and retail sits out. Is ETH becoming infrastructure without the culture? Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Ethereum (ETH) broke its 2021 all-time high in August, brushing $4,945 and a $600 billion market cap, while exchange balances hit record lows. Corporate treasuries and spot ETFs now control nearly 11% of the circulating supply. By every structural metric, ETH should feel like it's having a moment. It doesn't. No Bored Apes are selling for seven figures. No TikTok explainers are going viral. The 2025 ETH rally is real, measurable, and entirely clinical. This is a quiet reallocation by institutions treating Ethereum less like a speculative trade and more like yield-bearing infrastructure. The cultural void raises a sharper question: is ETH transitioning from layer-1 casino to institutional plumbing, and what does price discovery look like when the buyers don't care about hype? The supply story is unambiguous. Only 10.5% of all ETH now sits on centralized exchanges as of Dec. 21, one of the lowest shares since the network launched and down 43% since July, per Coinglass data. Additionally, more than 35.6 million ETH is locked in staking as of Dec. 20. BlackRock’s filing raises questions on slashing risk, custody waterfalls and yield passthrough. We chart three scenarios for fees and liquidity. This isn't speculative hoarding, but rather an operational infrastructure. Nansen's holder composition shows the largest addresses are staking contracts, institutional custodians, and ETF wrappers, not whale wallets. Exchange float is draining, but not into day-trading accounts. It's moving into pipes: layer-2 bridges, restaking protocols, treasury vaults. Corporate balance sheets tell the same story. Treasury data from Dec. 19 estimates that corporate holders plus spot Ethereum ETFs now control 10.72% of the circulating supply. This is divided in 5.63% in corporate hands and 5.09% in ETFs, according to Strategic ETH Reserve data. BitMine has accumulated over 4 million ETH, equivalent to 3.36% of the total supply, and has explicit plans to reach 5%. These aren't venture bets, but strategic positions tied to Ethereum's role in stablecoin settlement and tokenized asset rails. ETF flows confirm the institutional tilt. Year-to-date, ETPs tracking ETH have drawn about $12.7 billion in net inflows, with US spot Ethereum ETFs representing $12.4 billion. The infrastructure is built. The allocators are here. The 2025 research cycle has started treating ETH as yield-bearing infrastructure rather than a levered bet on tokens. Citi's September note setting a $4,300 year-end target is explicit: the driver is demand for Ethereum-based stablecoins and tokenization, not speculative trading. The bank highlights staking yield as a differentiator for corporate portfolios, sketching a bull case to $6,400 if stablecoin adoption evolves on the optimistic trajectory. Binance Research argued that if stablecoin settlement and layer-2 scaling continue on current trends, ETH's valuation logic shifts from “deflationary asset” to “ecological infrastructure asset.” Data from rwa.xyz shows that Ethereum controls $12.5 billion of the tokenized real-world assets (RWA) market, equivalent to 66.6%. Ethereum's growth in RWA tokenization since 2024 has been stellar, rising from $1.5 billion, representing a 735% increase from its current size. Stablecoin usage also skyrocketed. According to data from Artemis, Ethereum recorded $1.6 trillion in monthly stablecoin transaction volume as of Dec. 21 and $172.1 billion in stablecoin supply. Supply growth is 141% compared to the $71.3 billion seen in January 2024. The thesis emerging from these reports is consistent: ETH is increasingly treated like a yield-bearing, rails-of-the-system asset in professional portfolios. It's about needing Ethereum to function as plumbing for tokenized dollars, securities, and derivatives that institutions are already building. NFTs are the clearest cultural contrast. Data from CryptoSlam shows NFT art sales plunging from nearly $16.5 billion in 2021 to just $2.2 billion in 2025, a drop of roughly 87%. LG shut down its Art Lab NFT marketplace, Tennis Australia's Artball collection saw floor prices collapse by around 90%, and CryptoPunks were transferred to a non-profit, with coverage bluntly observing that the “money-making days” are over. Google Trends data shows that crypto-related searches in the US remain well below prior-cycle peaks, rising to 100 only when prices grind higher between July and August. The participation mix confirms the shift. Retail mania has rotated heavily into US single-stock trading rather than altcoins. Ethereum ETP flows swing between huge inflow weeks and very large outflow weeks, more like a tug-of-war between structured products than a one-way retail stampede. The mismatch between accumulation and attention creates a medium-term puzzle. Traditional price discovery depends on a mix of fundamental flows and narrative momentum. Ethereum in 2025 has the former without the latter. ETFs and treasuries provide slow, steady demand. Staking locks up supply, and tokenization brings real-world assets to Ethereum. But the cultural engine that drove 2021, consisting of retail users treating every transaction like a statement, has stalled. This matters because Ethereum's valuation has always been partly reflexive. The network becomes more valuable as more applications build on it, partly because developers expect it to grow in value. That virtuous cycle depends on momentum, not just infrastructure. When corporate buyers treat ETH as a tool to settle tokenized bonds rather than a bet on the future of finance, they stabilize the asset but flatten its narrative arc. The wire shows ETH buying. The data shows supply draining from exchanges. What's missing is the cultural proof that any of this matters to anyone outside the trade. Ethereum may be transitioning from a speculative layer-1 to financial plumbing, and if that's the case, the 2021 feeling might not return. The question is whether the next phase of steady, institutional, infrastructure-driven flows can sustain the valuations that retail mania once underwrote.

Title: Will XRP Hit $5 in 2026? 5 Catalysts That Could Make It Happen—And 3 Risks That Won’t

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © DUSAN ZIDAR / Shutterstock.com XRP (CRYPTO: XRP) has spent years moving in tight ranges, but 2026 is shaping up as a decisive period. With institutional interest building, new products on the horizon, and macro conditions beginning to shift, investors are asking a sharper question than ever: will XRP hit $5 in 2026? Some believe a clear set of catalysts could finally unlock that level. Others argue that the same risks that held XRP back before still apply. To understand what comes next, it helps to separate what could realistically drive a move for the XRP price to $5 from what could prevent it. Andrey Gorgots / Shutterstock.com XRP reaching $5 in 2026 requires specific drivers working together. Five catalysts are already in motion, and each one addresses a different barrier that has kept the XRP price range-bound. Speculation around a BlackRock-backed XRP ETF sits at the top of the list because of what it represents: scale, credibility, and regulated access. Since mid-November 2025, spot XRP ETFs have attracted over $1 billion in cumulative inflows, led by Canary Capital, Franklin Templeton, and Grayscale. Market observers have pointed out that XRP-linked funds appear less sensitive to short-term macro stress, suggesting a different investor base. While BlackRock stated in August 2025 that it has no immediate plans for an XRP ETF, analysts believe regulatory clarity and sustained ETF demand could change that calculus. If BlackRock eventually moves forward, estimates suggest inflows could reach $2 billion or more. That level of capital would reshape demand and strengthen the case for XRP hitting $5. It would also position XRP as the only crypto asset with an ETF tied to a fully regulated token in the U.S. Japan is quietly becoming one of the most important regions in the long-term XRP story. Ripple and SBI Holdings plan to launch RLUSD—Ripple’s USD-backed stablecoin—in Japan by Q1 2026 through SBI VC Trade, pending regulatory approval. The project is being built through licensed trust banks and exchanges under Japan’s Payment Services Act. Japan accounts for more than half of Ripple’s global payment volume. When regulated stablecoins become part of domestic and cross-border settlement, XRPL’s role as an infrastructure gains relevance. Banks using RLUSD on the XRP Ledger create real demand for XRP as a bridge currency. This supports the XRP reaching $5 case, even if the impact builds gradually over quarters. Tokenization is where blockchain adoption moves beyond theory. Ripple’s expanded relationship with Archax—a regulated digital securities exchange—reflects this shift. The partnership aims to bring hundreds of millions of dollars in tokenized equities, debt, and funds onto XRPL by mid-2026. Archax operates in a regulated environment and has already shown that tokenized traditional assets can function at scale. XRPL’s fast settlement—transactions clear in 3-5 seconds—and low fees make it suitable for this use case. Traditional securities settlement can take days and cost significantly more. As global consulting firms project tokenized assets reaching trillions of dollars by the end of the decade. If XRPL captures even 5-10% of tokenized asset settlement, the utility demand for XRP multiplies, and this harnesses its case of reaching $5 in 2026. Macro policy remains one of the most important background forces shaping XRP’s upside potential. Expected Federal Reserve rate cuts would lower returns on cash and short-term bonds, historically pushing capital toward risk assets offering growth and liquidity. Large-cap digital assets usually benefit first from this shift, especially those with deep markets and improving regulatory clarity. XRP fits that profile—consistent volume, global recognition, and increasing institutional discussion. Rate cuts don’t cause price rallies by themselves, but they change behavior. Capital becomes more willing to take exposure, and risk tolerance rises across portfolios. In that environment, questions like “will XRP hit $5” move from speculation to portfolio debate as allocation decisions begin to shift. Supply dynamics add another layer to this outlook, and recent on-chain data makes the shift hard to ignore. Exchange-held XRP fell sharply, with 1.35 billion XRP pulled off exchanges in less than two months. Balances dropped from roughly 3.95 billion tokens to about 2.6 billion, with more than 1 billion leaving in just three weeks. This pace suggests a decisive change in behavior. Large withdrawals signal that holders are moving XRP into longer-term storage—cold wallets and institutional custody—rather than keeping it readily available for sale. While this doesn’t guarantee higher prices, it does reduce immediate sell pressure and tightens available liquidity. If demand rises through ETFs, institutional participation, or settlement-related use while supply remains constrained, price movements can accelerate. This is why exchange outflows feature so prominently in discussions about XRP’s upside potential heading into 2026. Tamisclao / Shutterstock.com Even with multiple bullish drivers in place, there are clear risks that could prevent XRP from reaching higher levels. These risks are structural and they explain why the question of XRP hitting $5 still divides investors. The largest risk remains regulation. XRP’s progress over the past year has been closely tied to improving legal clarity and regulatory acceptance following the August 2025 SEC settlement. That progress underpins institutional interest and ETF-related momentum. However, regulatory environments can change quickly. A tougher stance from U.S. regulators, new compliance requirements, or delays in XRP ETF approvals could slow institutional participation. For large investors, certainty matters more than speed, and any sign of reversal would likely pause capital inflows and weaken confidence. Ownership concentration is another important risk. XRP has a history of large holders selling into strength. When price moves higher, these holders often take profits, increasing sell pressure at key resistance levels. This behavior can flatten rallies even when broader sentiment is positive. If distribution accelerates during a breakout attempt, demand from ETFs or retail investors may struggle to absorb the supply. This dynamic has capped previous rallies and remains a real obstacle to XRP reaching the $5 target. The final risk sits outside the crypto market entirely. A global economic slowdown or recession would reduce appetite for risk assets across the board. In such conditions, investors typically rotate into cash, bonds, or defensive assets. Even strong crypto narratives struggle when liquidity tightens. If recession fears dominate in 2026—triggered by banking stress, geopolitical shocks, or persistent inflation—capital that might have flowed into digital assets could stay sidelined. You can have perfect fundamentals, but if the economy contracts, risk assets like XRP suffer. XRP reaching $5 wouldn’t come from a single headline or short burst of momentum. It would require a rare alignment of multiple forces playing out together. ETF inflows would need to remain strong and consistent, institutional adoption would have to translate into real, sustained capital commitment, macro conditions must stay supportive, supply conditions would need to remain tight, and whales would need to hold rather than distribute aggressively into strength. XRP hitting $5 requires all five catalysts to align while the three major risks stay dormant. BlackRock files an ETF, Japan launches RLUSD at scale, tokenization gains traction, the Fed cuts rates, and supply stays locked up—all while regulators stay friendly, whales hold their positions, and the economy avoids recession. It’s a narrow path, but possible. How many of these factors actually align will decide whether XRP hits $5 in 2026 or consolidates below $3 while building for a later run.
