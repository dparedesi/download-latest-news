UPDATED 15:00 EDT / JUNE 27 2025 by Victoria Gayton Crypto’s latest evolution is less about chaos and more about construction. Stablecoins are gaining traction as real-world assets move on-chain, regulatory infrastructure is taking shape and developers are laying new groundwork for how digital value flows across systems and borders. At theCUBE + NYSE Wired Crypto Trailblazer NYC event, that reinvention took center stage. Executives from across the crypto and blockchain ecosystem discussed everything from tokenization and compliance to talent pipelines, decentralized finance and the next wave of fintech integration. Whether building new bridges to Wall Street or doubling down on distributed networks, these leaders are shaping the next phase of blockchain-backed business. Abra’s Bill Barhydt joins theCUBE’s John Furrier to discuss classic Bitcoin and emerging new currencies. “The classic Bitcoin crypto is what people are holding, and there’s new currency coming out,” said theCUBE Research’s John Furrier during the event. “You’ve got two things: Mainstreaming the store of value and making that liquid and trading it … and then the wave coming … a paradigm shift … but it’s happening fast. We’re hearing from big institutions looking at how to figure out how do you digitize and create a digital twin … separate from all the stuff we love, agents, [artificial intelligence] stuff’s happening, too, so the massive wave is coming on all fronts.” Furrier and theCUBE Research’s Dave Vellante spoke with a lineup of C-suite crypto executives and entrepreneurial visionaries during theCUBE + NYSE Wired Crypto Trailblazer NYC event, in an exclusive broadcast on theCUBE, SiliconANGLE Media’s livestreaming studio. Conversations spanned blockchain infrastructure, decentralized finance, market volatility and emerging opportunities across fintech and enterprise. Here’s a breakdown of eight standout interviews from the event: Abra Capital Management LP offers a platform that allows users to earn a yield on Bitcoin, stake Solana and Ethereum, and borrow against their crypto holdings, according to Bill Barhydt (pictured), founder and chief executive officer of Abra. The service is designed to make decentralized finance accessible without technical complexity, and clients retain title to their assets through separately managed accounts rather than relying on exchange-based custody. Bitcoin functions as a fixed-supply, appreciating asset that outpaces traditional stores of value, Barhydt noted. Tokenized real-world assets such as real estate and equities can be traded and used as collateral in global lending markets worth trillions. Barhydt also sees crypto infrastructure playing a future role in automated agent economies, where stablecoins and decentralized autonomous organizations enable new forms of digital ownership and financial activity. Watch theCUBE’s complete interview. CoinFund Management LLC, an early mover in crypto-native investments, backs visionary founders through pre-seed, seed and Series A/B stages while also running a liquid strategy focused on tokens and equities. Fundamental research underpins its approach, examining bespoke technologies shaping digital value exchange. Embedding private property digitally through decentralized, trustless systems is redefining the architecture of the internet, according to Christopher Perkins, chief executive officer of CoinFund. Decentralization can mitigate centralized AI’s vulnerabilities, strengthening data sovereignty, distributing computational tasks and enhancing transparency in AI model training. As Stablecoins inject potentially $2 to $3 trillion on-chain, decentralized finance will surge, enabling AI-powered transaction agents. Clear, proactive policy measures to bolster digital asset security could empower private sector innovation, lure talent back to the U.S. and ensure a safer entrepreneurial landscape, Perkins noted. Get the full story on theCUBE. Dynamic Labs Inc., backed by investors Andreessen Horowitz and Founders Fund, streamlines crypto wallet infrastructure, making it simpler for developers and businesses to build fintech apps and neobanks. By abstracting complexities such as money movement, security and key management through multi-party computation, Dynamic enables developers to prioritize brand building over backend intricacies. Its platform facilitates rapid, global money transfers and supports innovative business models, including micro-communities integrated with crypto payments, according to Itai Turbahn, chief executive officer of Dynamic Labs. Dynamic Lab’s Itai Turbahn talks with theCUBE about the company’s newly launched stablecoin accounts. Dynamic’s newly launched stablecoin accounts further streamline transactions, enabling smooth fiat-to-crypto and crypto-to-fiat conversions through a single software development kit. This capability simplifies the launch of global payment apps and neobanks, drastically lowering the entry barriers for financial innovators. Additionally, Dynamic’s “server wallets” are tailored for the emerging agent economy, empowering AI-driven agents to transact and manage funds autonomously, according to Turbahn. Don’t miss the full story on theCUBE. ICE Ventures LLC entered crypto early by developing institutional-grade, on-premises custodial infrastructure and introducing physically delivered Bitcoin futures contracts, a move ahead of its time. Responding to market evolution and regulatory developments such as the GENIUS Act, ICE is now unlocking the potential of stablecoins by exploring currency pairs backed by highly regulated tokens such as USDC, according to Trabue Bland, senior vice president of futures exchange at ICE Ventures. ICE’s global network of exchanges positions it uniquely to enhance crypto price discovery and bring efficiency to electronic trading — especially as stablecoins grow in usage — addressing market inefficiencies such as fragmented pricing and high fees. Additionally, as AI’s energy demands surge, ICE leverages its deep expertise to navigate and capitalize on emerging opportunities at the intersection of artificial intelligence and energy markets, Bland noted. Catch theCUBE’s complete interview. Anchorage Digital, a subsidiary of Anchor Labs Inc., the sole federally chartered crypto bank in the U.S., provides institutional-grade services, including custody, staking, settlement and trading, attracting major institutions such as BlackRock Inc. for Bitcoin exchange-traded funds. The crypto industry’s maturation is underscored by Circle Internet Financial LLC’s IPO and bipartisan legislative efforts, such as the GENIUS Act, which brings crucial regulatory clarity to stablecoins. These assets often carry less risk and more stability than traditional bank deposits, according to Diogo Monica, co-founder and executive chairman of Anchorage Digital. Anchorage Digital’s Diogo Monica talks with theCUBE about bringing regulatory clarity to stablecoins. Stablecoins essentially tokenize dollars backed primarily by U.S. Treasuries, requiring decentralized blockchain infrastructure to function securely and independently of traditional financial constraints. The upcoming wave of asset tokenization — covering fixed income and equities ahead of real estate — promises enhanced global liquidity, fractional ownership and frictionless portfolio trading. As crypto quietly integrates into mainstream applications, many users engage with blockchain-enabled financial solutions without even realizing it, signaling a subtle yet profound shift in everyday finance, according to Mónica. Watch the full interview on theCUBE. 10T Holdings LLC, a growth equity fund that targets solely crypto, blockchain and Web3 assets, invests in developed-stage companies, typically generating at least $40 to $50 million in revenue. Dan Tapiero, founder, chief executive officer and chief information officer of 10T Holdings LLC, predicted in 2019 that the crypto market would reach $10 trillion in total value within a decade; it’s already halfway there at approximately $5 trillion today, prompting plans for a new fund targeting an even larger $50 trillion market. Significant growth in public crypto and blockchain enterprises is imminent, with at least 10 portfolio companies expected to go public within the next two years, according to Tapiero. Recent shifts in U.S. regulatory and political attitudes now position the United States to become the global hub for crypto and blockchain innovation, with government efforts aimed at solidifying this leadership. Public listings on major exchanges, such as the NYSE and NASDAQ, are essential for legitimizing cryptocurrency enterprises — especially those tied to stablecoins — both domestically and internationally. Additionally, global demand for stablecoins continues to rise sharply, especially in countries with unstable currencies, highlighting their critical role in wealth preservation and everyday transactions worldwide, according to Tapiero. Listen to the full story on theCUBE. Ledger SAS develops hardware solutions that safeguard sensitive online information, initially targeting cryptocurrency private keys, but now expanding into decentralized identity, healthcare data and broader digital assets. As tokenization becomes widespread and public blockchain applications proliferate, robust hardware security solutions will become indispensable for safely managing diverse digital assets, moving beyond simple investment speculation, according to Pascal Gauthier, chief executive officer of Ledger. Ledger’s Pascal Gauthier talks with theCUBE about enhancing digital security standards. Ledger maintains two core business segments — consumer and enterprise — both dedicated to enhancing digital security standards. Its enterprise division leverages proprietary intellectual property to secure private keys and governance layers, establishing rigorous access controls and preventing asset mismanagement. Additionally, Ledger fosters a dynamic developer ecosystem, supporting third-party apps on its security platform, and provides user-friendly products such as “Stacks,” which combine ease of use, robust security and multiple backup capabilities, according to Gauthier. Check out theCUBE’s full story. Talos Global Inc. was established to provide institutional-grade trading systems for digital assets, anticipating the growth of crypto into a comprehensive asset class that encompasses all capital markets. Initially connecting fragmented liquidity providers — including exchanges, over-the-counter desks, market makers, and decentralized platforms — Talos has evolved to offer advanced solutions such as portfolio management and settlement tools. As traditional institutions increasingly adopt digital asset infrastructures, the industry enters what is seen as the final transformative phase, according to Anton Katz, chief executive officer of Talos. Talos’ unified platform caters to traditional asset managers, overseeing trillions in assets and providing a secure and familiar gateway for incorporating digital assets into diverse investment portfolios. Driven by client demand for faster, globalized and more accessible financial solutions, the migration of traditional asset classes onto digital rails appears inevitable, despite operational considerations such as balancing rapid settlements and necessary oversight. Embracing a build, buy or partner approach, Talos aims to become a comprehensive “one-stop shop” for institutional investors, covering the entire investment lifecycle from pre-trade preparation to post-trade compliance, according to Katz.

Title: Founder of Neuralink rival Precision Neuroscience reveals what people often get wrong about brain-implant surgery
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/neuralink-rival-brain-implant-surgery-doesnt-need-to-be-invasive-2025-6
Time Published: 2025-06-27T17:28:48Z

The most important matter, gray matter that is, sits right at the surface. At least that's the line from Dr. Ben Rapoport, the cofounder and chief science officer of Precision Neuroscience, a brain-computer interface, or BCI, company. "Many people have the impression that the data that we care about is sort of everywhere inside this dimensional structure," Rapoport, a neurosurgeon and engineer, told Business Insider. That's a big misconception, he said. People often incorrectly assume that "you need electrodes that penetrate deep inside the brain to get that information out," he added. But brain implants don't need to be as invasive as they might sound, he said. Precision is developing a thin film that sits on the brain and records brain activity in patients with paralysis. "We implant modules of 1,024 electrodes on the brain surface in the area that controls movement, especially the hand," Rapoport said. That allows them to have cursor control, typing ability, access the internet, use PowerPoint, play games, and word process, he added. These are actions that require vision, movement, sensation, and executive function — core parts of consciousness that are concentrated in the brain's outermost layer, the cortex, Rapoport said. Deeper inside are "connections, you know, between those activities and also sort of subconscious processes, because the brain coordinates a lot of activities in the body that don't take place consciously," he added. The New York-based startup, which received FDA clearance for part of its wireless brain-computer interface in April, has raised $155 million in funding since it launched in 2021. It is one of a few companies advancing this technology as part of the Implantable BCI Collaborative Community, an initiative launched in partnership with the FDA in 2024. BCIs are largely classified into two categories: invasive and non-invasive. Non-invasive BCIs, which don't require surgery, often rely on external sensors to detect the electrical signals in the brain. BCIs that are implanted record neural activity directly from the brain and are being developed to restore speech, movement, and other complex functions in people with neurological conditions. The buzziest BCI these days is Elon Musk's Neuralink, which has ambitions to create a "symbiosis" between the human brain and AI. But there are a host of other companies working on BCIs as a way to treat neurological diseases, like Precision Neuroscience. The company has tested its temporary device in over forty patients in early clinical studies. Over the next year, it will prepare for the first human studies of its permanently implanted devices. "There are certain internal validation checks and internal milestones that we need to meet for ourselves and for the FDA before we want to start implanting the permanently implanted wireless device in humans," Rapoport said. The company's ultimate goal is to help paralyzed people get "back to a level of functional capacity where they can be significantly independent, economically self-sufficient, and hold a job in the workplace," Rapoport said. Correction: June 27, 2025 — An earlier version of this story said that Dr. Ben Rapoport was the founder and CEO of Precision Neuroscience; Dr. Rapoport is the cofounder and chief science officer. An earlier version also mischaracterized the film that goes on the brain. It is not studded with electrodes; the electrodes are embedded. The story also clarifies that the implants are not a potential cure but a potential treatment for neurological disorders. Jump to

Law firms look to head consolidated class action suits, a role that would enable them to boost their earnings from the case, they said. They often file separately in such cases until a judge names a lead plaintiff and combines the separate actions. “Law firms jockey for position as lead counsel in securities class actions because the fees can be very lucrative,” said University of Michigan Law School professor Adam Pritchard—“tens of millions of dollars and occasionally more in the biggest cases.” Each suit accuses Strategy, formerly MicroStrategy, of misleading investors about the anticipated profitability and risks in its Bitcoin buying by making “materially false and misleading” public statements. They allege the fraud occurred over an 11-month period between April 30, 2024 and April 4, 2025. The first class action was filed by Pomerantz LLP on May 16. But rather than join in the first class action, identical lawsuits have been filed by Gross Law Firm, Bronstein, Gewirtz & Grossman, Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check, and Levi & Korsinsky. None of the five law firms responded to repeated requests for comment from Decrypt. “The position of lead plaintiff is valuable,” Ann Lipton, a law professor at the University of Colorado, told Decrypt. “The lead plaintiff controls the litigation and selects counsel, who will eventually be counsel for the class. So when a case looks strong, multiple firms and plaintiffs will file complaints to throw their hat in the ring.” Lipton and Pritchard said that law firms file identical suits in cases like this to advertise themselves as the right firm to see the case through. Each of the five firms has sent multiple press releases trying to attract more plaintiffs. Many of them prominently remind potential participants of the July 15 deadline for when a judge will choose a lead plaintiff. Once that happens, the rest of the plaintiffs will be consolidated under that plaintiff’s class action. But law firms don’t just want a lot of plaintiffs; they want to secure the biggest investors possible, Pritchard explained. That’s because the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 says that courts should award the lead plaintiff spot to someone who’s volunteered to assume that role and has the largest losses. “The theory is that a plaintiff with more skin in the game will oversee the case and the lawyers,” Lipton said. “Institutions are favored, as well, because again they are more likely to provide necessary oversight.” It’s not clear yet if any of MSTR’s largest holders have signed on to become plaintiffs in the competing class actions. As of an October SEC filing, Strategy co-founder and Executive Chairman Michael Saylor is still the single largest shareholder with 19,998,580 shares, worth almost $7.8 billion at the current MSTR price of $389.50. But there are large institutions in the mix, including Vanguard Group with an 8.55% stake, BlackRock and Capital International Investors with 5.8% stake each, Susquehanna Securities with a 4.8% stake, and Jane Street Group with a 4.7% stake in the company. The value of Strategy’s 592,345 BTC recently climbed above $63 billion, according to bitcointreasuries.net. The lawsuit frenzy kicked off after Strategy warned investors in April that it was unlikely to report a Q1 profit because of the nearly $6 billion in unrealized losses on its BTC holdings. In an SEC filing, the company said it “may not be able to regain profitability in future periods, particularly if we incur significant unrealized losses related to our digital assets.” The company went on to report a $16.49 per common share decline in Q1. In early April, the company’s 528,185 Bitcoin was worth approximately $41.3 billion. Strategy spent a whopping $7.7 billion buying BTC in Q1 at an average price of $95,000 per coin. But by the time the company needed to file its Q1 earnings report, the price of BTC had sunk to about $82,000 per coin. It has since rebounded to about $107,000, as of this writing. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Decrypt. But it has been acknowledging the lawsuits in 8-K filings with the SEC. In each one it repeats: “We intend to vigorously defend against these claims. At this time, we cannot predict the outcome, or provide a reasonable estimate or range of estimates of the possible outcome or loss, if any, in this matter.” Edited by James Rubin Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2025 Decrypt Media, Inc.

Ireland v Georgia, Stadio San Michele, Sunday, 5pm Irish time (Live on Rugby Pass TV) It’s been a difficult season to date for the Ireland Under-20s, losing four of five matches in the Six Nations and finishing bottom of the table. To compound matters they suffered a heavy defeat to Scotland, the only team they beat in that tournament, in a warm-up game ahead of the World Championship. There were some mitigating circumstances for Neil Doak’s side, injuries depriving them of key players, but it doesn’t begin to explain the recurring performance glitches that undermined their ambition. Aspects of their patterns were good, they didn’t lack courage or character, but they got lost very easily in the weeds of their mistakes. The playing personnel didn’t deviate much despite the results with the majority of changes coming in a turnstile selection within the matchday 23 from one game to the next, where starters were benched and then reinstated and vice versa. There is a presumption that secondrow Alan Spicer and tighthead prop Niall Smyth are still sidelined through injury. In more uplifting news, prop Alex Usanov, Luke Murphy and Derry Moloney are all fully rehabilitated in time for Sunday’s opening game in Calvisano. Tullamore native Páidí Farrell, who plays with Old Wesley, will make his first start in a tournament game. He possesses a rare attribute in Irish rugby circles, top-end pace and given reasonable ball is a try-scoring threat as he demonstrated capably and consistently in the All-Ireland League. There is a nice balance and plenty of footballing ability in the back three of Farrell, Charlie Molony and Derry Moloney, while the relocation of Ciarán Mangan (younger brother of Leinster’s Diarmuid) from wing to outside centre bodes well from an attacking perspective. He plays alongside the hard running Eoghan Smyth in midfield. Tom Wood, son of former Ireland international Keith, has won the number 10 shirt, with Clark Logan at scrumhalf. In the Six Nations, Wood showed a nice skill set and self-possession to play his way through tougher moments. He has a better kicking game than his dad. Billy Bohan, a player to emerge with credit during the Six Nations, teams up with Henry Walker and Alex Mullan in a ball-playing frontrow. Mahon Ronan and Billy Corrigan put in huge shifts in every match, while Murphy’s addition to a backrow which also contains captain Éanna McCarthy and Michael Foy, introduces steel and quality. Foy was arguably Ireland’s best player in the Six Nations, a turbocharged presence on both sides of the ball. Ireland’s bench has a number of players who can change the tempo of a match, none more so than replacement scrumhalf Will Wootton. Georgia will test Ireland’s mettle at the set piece, breakdown and on the gain-line. As they demonstrated last year when the sides met in this tournament, the Georgians are very sticky opponents, with Ireland squeezing home in a one-score game. They’d bite your hand off for a similar result here. Doak’s side will later play hosts Italy and New Zealand in their other pool games. IRELAND: Charlie Molony (UCD); Páidí Farrell (Old Wesley); Ciarán Mangan (Blackrock College), Eoghan Smyth (Cork Constitution), Derry Moloney (Blackrock College); Tom Wood (Garryowen), Clark Logan (QUB); Billy Bohan (Galway Corinthians), Henry Walker (QUB), Alex Mullan (Blackrock College); Mahon Ronan (Old Wesley), Billy Corrigan (Old Wesley); Michael Foy (UCC), Éanna McCarthy (Galwegians, capt), Luke Murphy (Young Munster).

Title: HDB Financial Services’ IPO gets ₹1.6 lakh crore in bids as institutional buyers pile in

India's IPO market is gaining momentum after a slow start, as the stock market stabilizes following earlier volatility driven by global trade concerns. The blue-chip Nifty 50 index, which hit a one-year low in April, now sits just 2.4 per cent below record highs from last year, as easing geopolitical tensions and trade fears spurred risk-on sentiment. HDB Financial, a unit of India's biggest private lender HDFC Bank, saw its issue subscribed 16.7 times over, driven by qualified institutional buyers such as foreign investors and mutual funds who bid for 55 times their reserved portion. Non-institutional investors bid for 10 times their portion, while retail investor interest was comparatively muted, with their shares being oversubscribed just 1.4 times, exchange data showed. The strong investor response makes HDB Financial's IPO the most subscribed offering over $1 billion since Zomato's in 2021, data from Prime Database showed. "The response to the issue has been very encouraging, and considering the issue size signals that investors are growing increasingly confident of the local market as global trade worries ebb out," said Narendra Solanki, head of research at Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers. "The bid numbers show that the primary markets are coming back to life after a lull earlier this year, and such a response for a sizeable issue like HDB's should give IPO hopefuls in the pipeline confidence to also come forth to test waters," Solanki added. HDB Financial' s IPO, the biggest ever by an Indian non-bank lender, was one of six offerings this week, five of which were oversubscribed in a range of 2-86 times. Earlier this week, Credila Financial Services and Pine Labs filed for IPOs. HDFC Bank, which holds a 94 per cent stake in HDB, sold shares worth up to ₹10,000 crore , while HDB issued new shares worth ₹2,500 crore. The company is targeting a valuation of up to $7.1 billion at the upper end of the 700-740 rupees price band. The stock is expected to start trading on July 2. HDB had already raised $392 million from anchor investors, including BlackRock funds, Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) and Norway's sovereign wealth fund.

Susan Wagner High School's virtual enterprise program allows students to take a deep dive into entrepreneurship, studying finance, marketing and other business applications before launching their own company. Here, Joseph Weisberg, center, who teaches the course, poses with his students for a selfie while on a class trip. (Courtesy of Joseph Weisberg)(Courtesy of Joseph Weisberg) STATEN ISLAND, N.Y. — For the past several years, a group of students at Susan Wagner High School has been operating a small business. The culmination of long hours, field trips and lots of classroom learning, the smallish virtual bakery enterprise was formed after its owners took several courses in finance, learned about break-even analysis and marketed their well-thought plan to local business owners. It’s a study in entrepreneurship that has undoubtedly changed their lives. “I came into high school very shy, not talkative, bad at public speaking,” said Liam Smith, a now-eloquent senior who’s headed to Hunter College to study biology in the fall. “But this class went beyond financial literacy. Not only did we become familiar with Quick Books, Excel and all the other Microsoft extensions, we filled our resumes with important life skills as well.” The four-year program, which is part of the school’s Business Academy, introduces students to the foundations of business in freshman year, followed by leadership and public presentation lessons in year two. During junior year, participants write a business plan and begin marketing a product. Senior year is when they launch and run a virtual company. Students in the Virtual Enterprise program pose for a picture outside of BlackRock, one of the world’s largest investment management and financial services firms. (Courtesy of Joseph Weisberg)(Courtesy of Joseph Weisberg) “This is the real deal — we have been a New York State Career and Technical Education [CTE] entrepreneurial preparatory program since 2021. We prepare students to become entrepreneurs and teach them to understand financial literacy,” said Joseph Weisberg, Susan Wagner’s CTE business teacher and virtual enterprise coordinator. “In this classroom they’re learning how to plan a career and make an impact in the local business community.” Weisberg, who worked as an accountant and had prior teaching experience before coming to Wagner in 2023, says students who complete the program are well prepared to enter the workforce with a solid understanding of career and financial management. “First they learn finance, marketing and management skills and in their final year they take part in a virtual enterprise where they sell a virtual product through an online marketplace,” he noted. “It’s simulation based, but the experience is very real.” For the past two years the students operated an inclusive bakery, one which catered to those with dietary restrictions. The students researched ingredients and even partnered with local bakers who advised them on how to prevent cross contamination and other food allergy issues. Susan Wagner High School's virtual enterprise program allows students to take a deep dive into entrepreneurship, studying finance, marketing and other business applications before launching their own company. (Courtesy of Joseph Weisberg)(Courtesy of Joseph Weisberg) “Each student walks away with a resume and cover letter, and plenty of real-life experience ready to apply for a position that suits them,” Weisberg said. “Over the course of four years, the students are taking a very in-depth look at the life of an entrepreneur. Many decide to continue studying business in college, others are well-prepared to jump right into the workforce.” Weisberg’s students say it is by far the best part of their high school experience. “My favorite part is how Mr. Weisberg values us,” said Max Koleci, a junior. “He takes a couple of students and gives them larger roles, shows us how to lead. From day one I knew I wanted to be one of those leaders.” Koleci praised the “tight knit” program, detailing how he was inspired by a class trip to the BlackRock, one of the world’s largest investment management and financial services firms. He called the entire experience “enlightening.” Students in Susan Wagner High School's Virtual Enterprise program work on a project in class. (Courtesy of Joseph Weisberg)(Courtesy of Joseph Weisberg) “We’re learning things in this program that I know I’ll apply in real life,” he said. “Business is very interesting and even though I’m not quite sure if I will pursue this field in the future, I know that I will use these lessons in whatever path I might take.” Chasity Gordon, also a junior, agreed. “This class has helped me learn who I want to be,” Gordon said. “I entered the program in sophomore year, and we had lessons in Adobe, Canva, PowerPoint. I know now that I want to pursue a career in marketing.” “This program helped me discover a lot of things about myself,” Liam Smith added. “I am so much more communicative and no longer anxious or stressed, struggling to picture my future — short or long term.” Each student walks away from the program with a Career and Technical Education diploma, a specialized New York state high school accreditation that recognizes students who have completed a rigorous program of study in a specific career field. It signifies that a student has not only met the standard graduation requirements but has also gained valuable skills and knowledge in a chosen career area. Students present a business plan during one of their Virtual Enterprise classes. (Courtesy of Joseph Weisberg)(Courtesy of Joseph Weisberg) While students say that diploma is “a big deal,” it’s most certainly not the only thing they earn from this course. “This is by far the best program that Wagner offers,” Max Koleci concluded. “Mr. Weisberg always tells us ‘even if you hate business, you will learn how to prepare a budget, how to calculate interest on car payment…’ and that’s the kind of real-deal stuff we’ve learned in his classroom.” If you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.

Equity benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty advanced for the fourth straight session on Friday, supported by buying in blue-chips ICICI Bank and Reliance Industries, amid fresh foreign fund inflows. A strengthening rupee against the US dollar and softening crude oil prices in international markets also boosted investor confidence, according to traders. Equity indices rise on blue-chip buying, foreign fund inflows, and positive global cues, boosting investor confidence. The rupee rose 24 paise to close at 85.48 (provisional) against the greenback on Friday on the back of strong FII inflows and firm domestic equity markets. Rupee strengthens against dollar on FII inflows and equity market boost, despite crude oil price uptrend. Today, the Indian stock market closed with a positive bias, reflecting investor optimism amid easing global tensions and favourable domestic cues. The BSE Sensex ended higher by approximately 303 points, closing around 84,058, while the NSE Nifty50 gained about 88 points to settle near 25,637. The market’s upside momentum was primarily driven by strong performances in sectors such as Oil & Gas, PSU Banks, with Nifty Oil & Gas index rising over 0.5%. The positive close was supported by hopes of a potential relaxation in US tariff deadlines, improved global market sentiments, and easing geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, which boosted risk appetite among investors. Additionally, the Indian rupee strengthened against the dollar, trading at around 85.51, further aiding market sentiment. Domestic factors such as robust IPO subscription rates, including HDB Financial Services and Sambhv Steel Tubes, also indicated sustained investor interest. DBS Bank India Ltd (DBIL) has waived prepayment and foreclosure charges for all Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) borrowers registered with UDYAM, making it easier for businesses to access credit and manage cash flow. Announced on MSME Day, this move reflects the bank’s continued commitment to supporting India’s MSMEs. The waiver is effective going forward and applies to both new and existing active borrowers. This proactive step aims to enhance borrower flexibility and aligns with regulatory guidance focused on improving transparency in lending. It also addresses a persistent challenge faced by many MSMEs — where foreclosure charges have often deterred early repayment or refinancing, restricting their ability to optimise cash flow management. Commenting on the development, Sudarshan Chari, Managing Director, and Head – SME Banking, DBS Bank India, said, “Access to flexible and affordable credit remains a critical need for micro, small and medium enterprises. By waiving prepayment and foreclosure charges, we are addressing a common challenge that often limits financial agility. This change enables businesses to repay loans early without penalty and reallocate funds towards immediate priorities or critical areas like inventory, technology, and expansion. It aligns with our broader efforts to support MSMEs with need-based solutions that strengthen their resilience and unlock long-term growth.” Delhivery shares traded flat on the BSE at ₹382.65.

Kinara Capital, a leading fintech driving MSME financial inclusion, today released its fourth edition of MSME Insights, signaling strong optimism and increased formalization in the MSME sector. MSME entrepreneurs are confident about their near-term business growth prospects. According to the latest MSME Insights, 81% of the surveyed MSMEs expect their business revenue to increase within the next 1-2 years. Of these, 34% anticipate a revenue growth of more than 15% in their businesses. Additionally, MSMEs are embracing formalization, with 51.7% of the surveyed reporting that they are now GST-registered. The fourth edition of MSME Insights is based on an extensive multilingual survey of 9,314 MSMEs from Manufacturing, Trading, and Services sectors conducted across Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, and the Union Territory of Puducherry. The MSME Insights is a comprehensive data analysis of current trends of micro-small-medium enterprises (MSMEs) based on firsthand input from business owners. MSME Insights also delved into the behavioral patterns within the MSME sector and the analysis uncovered a striking pattern across all sectors. MSMEs still depend significantly on cash transactions, even when not accounting for UPI usage. Over 84.3% of the surveyed MSMEs stated that between 25%-100% of their business transactions are conducted with actual cash—underscoring the need for deeper digitization efforts across the sector. Sharing her perspective, Hardika Shah, Founder & CEO, Kinara Capital, said, “On the occasion of World MSME Day, it is encouraging to witness the strong optimism shared by India’s MSMEs. The fact that 81% of respondents in our recent MSME Insights survey expressed confidence in their growth prospects speaks volumes about the sector’s resilience and ambition. This optimism is rooted in improved access to formal credit, which enables entrepreneurs to focus on expansion. However, the sector’s continued reliance on cash transactions highlights the need to accelerate digitization. Embracing digital payments can enhance financial transparency and significantly boost access to formal credit. Ultimately, digitization holds the key to reaching underserved MSMEs and closing India’s ₹30 lakh crore credit gap.” KEY FINDINGS FROM KINARA CAPITAL’S MSME INSIGHTS, FOURTH EDITION ● MSMEs are upbeat about their business growth : More than 81% of the respondents have indicated that they are expecting varying degrees of growth in their revenue. Of these, 47% of the respondents expect their revenue to witness a 5%-15% growth, 26.1% anticipate a growth of 15%-25% and 7.9% are optimistic of more than 25% growth in revenue. Only a small proportion, i.e., 1.1% foresee no growth. ●Cash is King for MSMEs : Overall, 84.3% of the surveyed MSMEs reported relying on cash (excluding UPI) for 25%-to-100% of their business transactions. While only 7.4% of the MSME respondents relied on cash for more than 75% of their business transactions, 30.5% depended on cash for 50%-to-75% of their business transactions. This outcome indicates that a shift to digital payments, though underway, is far from reaching its full potential. ●Formalization is on an Upswing : MSMEs are increasingly recognizing the benefits of Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance. According to the survey, 51.7% of respondents are GST-registered and file returns regularly. Of these, 29.4% expressed interest in GST-linked loan products that offer better interest rates or flexible tenures. Regular GST filings not only reflect consistent business activity but also provide a verifiable financial history that enhances credit eligibility. Additionally, GST registration reduces the overall tax burden through input tax credits and offers MSMEs the ease of doing business across state lines with a unified tax structure. SBI General Insurance, one of India’s leading general insurance providers, has partnered with Starfin India, a subsidiary of BLS E-Services, to introduce an innovative Hospital Daily Cash Benefit Plan for low-income families. Hospitalization costs can significantly impact savings due to the potentially high expenses associated with treatment, medication, and recovery. This financial stress is often compounded by income loss and out-of-pocket expenses such as travel, medication, and attendant care. Under this plan the policyholders will receive a fixed daily cash benefit during hospital stays due to illness or accidents, helping reduce financial stress during challenging times.

Title: Why AI Illiterate Directors Are The New Liability For Boards Today
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenwolfepereira/2025/06/26/why-ai-illiterate-directors-are-the-new-liability-for-boards-today/
Time Published: 2025-06-26T21:02:01Z

BySteven Wolfe Pereira BySteven Wolfe Pereira, Contributor. Twenty-three years after Sarbanes-Oxley mandated financial experts on audit committees, boards face an even more transformative moment. But unlike the post-Enron era when adding one qualified financial expert sufficed, the AI revolution demands something far more radical: every director must become AI literate, or risk becoming a liability in the intelligence age. I just came back for the Stanford Directors’ College, the premier executive education program for directors and senior executives of publicly traded firms. Now in its thirtieth year, this year’s speakers included Reed Hastings, (Chairman, Co-Founder & Former CEO, Netflix; Director, Anthropic), Michael Sentonas (President, Crowdstrike), Maggie Wilderotter (Chairman, Docusign; Director, Costco, Fortinet and Sana Biotechnology), John Donahoe (Former CEO, Nike, ServiceNow, and eBay; Former Chairman, PayPal) and Condoleezza Rice (Director, Hoover Institution; Former U.S. Secretary of State). Organized by Stanford Law Professor Joseph Grundfest and the Co-Executive Director of Stanford’s Rock Center for Corporate Governance Amanda Packel, the program addresses a broad range of problems that confront modern boards. The topics are extensive, including the board’s role in setting business strategy, CEO and board succession, crisis management, techniques for controlling legal liability, challenges posed by activist investors, boardroom dynamics, international trade issues, the global economy, and cybersecurity threats. However, the topic that everyone wanted to discuss was AI. Joseph A. Grundfest, (Co-Director, Stanford Directors’ College; W.A. Franke Professor of Law and ... More Business, Emeritus, Stanford Law School; Senior Faculty, Rock Center for Corporate Governance), interviews the AI-savvy Reed Hastings (Chairman, Co-Founder & Former CEO, Netflix; Director, Anthropic) at the 2025 Stanford Directors' College. The stakes couldn’t be higher. While traditional boards debate AI risks in quarterly meetings, a new breed of AI-first competitors operates at algorithmic speed. Consider Cursor, which reached $500 million in annual recurring revenue with just 60 employees, or Cognition Labs, valued at $4 billion with only 10 people. These aren’t just “unicorns”, they’re the harbingers of a fundamental shift in how AI-first businesses operate. After Enron’s collapse, the Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) act required boards to include at least one "qualified financial expert" who understood GAAP, financial statements, and internal controls. Companies either complied or publicly explained why they lacked such expertise—a powerful mechanism that transformed board composition within five years. Today’s AI challenge dwarfs that financial literacy mandate. Unlike accounting expertise that could be compartmentalized to audit committees, AI permeates every business function. When algorithms make thousands of decisions daily across marketing, operations, HR, and customer service, delegating oversight to a single "tech expert" becomes not just inadequate but dangerous. The data reveals a governance crisis in motion. According to ISS analysis, only 31% of S&P 500 companies disclosed any board oversight of AI in 2024 and a mere 11% reported explicit full board or committee oversight. This despite an 84% year-over-year increase in such disclosures, suggesting boards are scrambling to catch up. Institutional investors have moved from encouragement to enforcement. BlackRock’s 2025 proxy voting guidelines emphasize board composition must reflect necessary "experiences, perspectives, and skillsets," with explicit warnings about voting against directors at companies that are "outliers compared to market norms." Vanguard and State Street have issued similar guidance, while Glass Lewis added a new AI governance section to its 2025 policies. Large institutional investors, such as BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street, have varying policies ... More on board oversight of material risks and are now looking at AI governance. The enforcement mechanism? Universal proxy cards, mandatory since September 2022, enable surgical strikes against individual directors. Activists launched 243 campaigns in 2024 (the highest total since 2018’s record of 249 campaigns), with technology sector campaigns up 15.9% year-over-year. Boards with "skills gaps related to areas where the company is underperforming" face the highest vulnerability - and nothing screams skills gap louder than AI illiteracy while competitors automate core functions. Consider what happened in 2024: 27 CEOs resigned due to activist pressure, up from 24 in 2023 and well above the four-year average of 16. The percentage of S&P 500 CEO resignations linked to activist activity has tripled since 2020. The message is clear: governance failures have consequences, and AI governance represents the next frontier for activist campaigns. Here’s the scenario keeping forward-thinking directors awake: while your board debates whether to form an AI committee, a three-person startup with 100+ AI agents is systematically capturing your market share. This isn’t hyperbole. In legal services, AI achieves 100x productivity gains, reducing document review from 16 hours to 3-4 minutes. Harvey AI raised $300 million at a $3 billion valuation, while Crosby promises contract review in under an hour. In software development, companies report 60% faster cycle times and 50% fewer production errors. Salesforce aims to deploy one billion AI agents within 12 months, with each agent costing $2 per conversation versus human customer service representatives. The economics are devastating for traditional business models. AI-first companies operate with 80-95% lower operational costs while achieving comparable or superior output. They reach $100 million in annual recurring revenue in 12-18 months versus the traditional 5-10 years. When Cursor generates nearly a billion lines of working code daily, traditional software companies' armies of developers become competitive liabilities, not assets. Boards accustomed to delegating technology oversight to CIOs or audit committees face a rude awakening. Traditional IT governance focuses on infrastructure, cybersecurity, and compliance (the "what" of technology management). AI governance requires understanding the “should” - whether AI capabilities should be deployed, how they impact stakeholders, and what ethical boundaries must be maintained. The fundamental difference: IT systems follow rules; AI systems learn and evolve. When Microsoft’s Tay chatbot learned toxic behavior from social media in 2016, it wasn’t a coding error, it was a governance failure. When COMPAS sentencing software showed racial bias, it wasn’t a bug but rather inadequate board oversight of algorithmic decision-making. Stanford’s Institute for Human-Centered AI research confirms that AI governance can't be delegated like financial oversight. AI creates "network effects" where individual algorithms interact unpredictably. Traditional governance assumes isolated systems; AI governance must address systemic risks from interconnected algorithms making real-time decisions across the enterprise. Just as SOX created demand for Qualified Financial Experts (QFEs), the AI revolution is spawning a new designation: Qualified Technology Experts (QTEs). The market dynamics favor early movers. Spencer Stuart’s 2024 Board Index shows 16% of new S&P 500 independent directors brought digital/technology transformation expertise versus only 8% with traditional P&L leadership. The scarcity is acute: requiring both technology expertise and prior board experience creates a severe talent shortage. This presents both risk and opportunity. For incumbent directors, AI illiteracy becomes a liability targetable by activists. For business-savvy technology leaders or tech-savvy business leaders, board service offers unprecedented opportunities. As one search consultant noted, “Technology roles offer pathways for underrepresented groups to join boards” - diversity through capability rather than tokenism. The SEC has elevated AI to a top 2025 examination priority, with enforcement actions against companies making false AI claims. Former SEC Chair Gary Gentler’s warning that "false claims about AI hurt investors and undermine market integrity" was just the beginning about concerns about the rise of “AI washing,” or exaggerating and misrepresenting the use of AI. The Commission sent comments to 56 companies regarding AI disclosures, with 61% requesting clarification on AI usage and risks. The SEC is increasing concerned about "AI washing" and AI disclosures Internationally, the EU AI Act establishes the world’s first comprehensive AI regulatory framework, with board-level accountability requirements taking effect through 2026. Like GDPR, its extraterritorial reach affects global companies. Hong Kong’s Monetary Authority already requires board accountability for AI-driven decisions, while New York's Department of Financial Services mandates AI risk oversight for insurance companies. The pattern is unmistakable: just as Enron triggered SOX, AI governance failures will trigger mandatory expertise requirements. The only question is whether boards act proactively or wait for the next scandal to force their hand. The data reveals a dangerous disconnect. While nearly 70% of directors trust management’s AI execution skills, only 50% feel adequately informed about AI-related risks. Worse, almost 50% of boards haven’t discussed AI in the past year despite mounting stakeholder pressure. While many academic institutions and trade orgs are trying to fill this need, these traditional director education models (including annual conferences and occasional briefings) can’t match the exponential speed of AI’s evolution. Boards need continuous learning mechanisms, regular AI strategy sessions, and direct access to expertise. The parallels to Sarbanes-Oxley are instructive but incomplete. Financial literacy requirements responded to past failures; AI literacy requirements must anticipate future transformation. When three-person startups with AI agent swarms can outcompete thousand-employee corporations, traditional governance models aren’t ready for these existential threats. The window for proactive adaptation is closing rapidly. ISS tracks AI governance. Institutional investors demand it. Activists target its absence. Regulators prepare mandates. Most critically, AI-native competitors exploit governance gaps with algorithmic efficiency. For boards, the choice is stark: develop AI literacy now while you can shape your approach, or scramble to catch up after activists, regulators, or competitors force your hand. In the post-Enron era, boards asked, "Do we have a qualified financial expert?" In the AI era, the question becomes, "Is every director AI literate?" The answer will determine not just governance quality but corporate survival. Because in a world where algorithms drive business, directors who can’t govern AI can't govern at all.

Title: Digital Harvest: BlackRock, Vanguard, State Street – Shareholders in the Shadows

Editor Economy Colin Todhunter, OffGuardian They don’t sell seeds. They don’t own tractors. They don’t run warehouses or ship grain. But BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street are among the most powerful actors in global agriculture. Together, these three asset managers control more than $26 trillion in assets—more than the GDP of the United States and India combined. They are shareholders in nearly every major agribusiness: Bayer, Cargill, ADM, Nestlé, Deere & Co and more. They don’t compete. They co-own. And through that ownership, they govern. This is not capitalism as competition. It’s capitalism as quiet coordination. These firms don’t need to dictate policy. They shape the terrain on which policy is made. Their influence is structural, not spectacular. It’s exercised through boardrooms, shareholder resolutions and capital flows. And it’s largely invisible to the public. But its effects are everywhere. According to the Food Barons 2022 report by ETC Group, BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street hold dominant stakes across the agrifood chain—from seeds and chemicals to supermarkets and logistics platforms. In many sectors, they are the top three shareholders in all the major firms. This means that ‘competition’ between companies like Bayer and Syngenta, or Nestlé and PepsiCo, is often little more than a performance. The real power sits behind the curtain. These firms don’t micromanage. They don’t need to. Their power lies in alignment—in shaping what counts as value, what counts as risk and what counts as acceptable behaviour. And increasingly, that behaviour is being framed through the lens of ESG: Environmental, Social and Governance metrics. But ESG is not a moral compass. It’s a risk framework. In recent years, BlackRock and its peers have positioned themselves as climate-conscious investors. They speak of ‘net zero’, ‘transition finance’, and ‘sustainable agriculture’. But this is not about decarbonising the food system. It’s about de-risking portfolios. The same firms that invest in fossil fuels also invest in carbon offset schemes. The same firms that back industrial agriculture also fund ‘climate-smart’ seed technologies. It’s a hedging strategy, not a transformation. And in India, this logic is taking root. Asset managers are increasingly backing land-leasing platforms, agrifintech startups and carbon credit aggregators that promise to ‘unlock value’ from farmland. But unlocking value often means locking farmers into new forms of dependency—on scoring systems, digital compliance and speculative markets they don’t control. This is not investment. It’s extraction with a sustainability label. The most dangerous shift in agriculture today is not technological—it’s financial. Land is no longer just a place to grow food. It’s an asset class. A hedge against inflation. A site for data capture and carbon speculation. In this model, the farmer is not a producer. They are a tenant on someone else’s spreadsheet. And the spreadsheet is global. BlackRock doesn’t need to own the land. It just needs to own the firm that owns the firm that leases the land. Through layers of investment vehicles, farmland is being bundled, securitised and traded—often without the knowledge of those who live on it. This is enclosure without fences. Governance without government. Asset managers like to present themselves as passive investors. They claim they don’t direct company strategy—they just follow the market. But when you own 5–10 per cent of every major firm in a sector, you are the market. And when you vote on shareholder resolutions, appoint board members and shape executive pay, you are not passive. In 2023, BlackRock and Vanguard voted against resolutions that would have required agribusinesses to disclose their impacts on deforestation and land rights. Their justification? The proposals were “too prescriptive”. But what they were really protecting was the freedom to operate without scrutiny. What makes BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street so dangerous is not that they are evil. It’s that they are structural. They don’t need to conspire. Their incentives are aligned. Their tools are abstract. And their power is exercised through absence—of regulation, of transparency, of accountability. They are not the villains of this story. They are the architecture. And that makes them harder to fight. Food sovereignty is not just about seeds or soil. It’s about power. And power today is financial. It flows through indexes, benchmarks and capital allocations. It decides which crops are grown, which firms survive, and which futures are funded. And it does so without ever touching the soil.

Title: Analysts predict $30 trillion market cap for tokenized RWA by 2034

The report assessed that capturing 10 to 30% of global securities and alternative assets by 2034 would bring the on-chain figure closer to the $16 trillion to $30 trillion range. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. RedStone, risk-modeling firm Gauntlet, and analytics provider RWA.xyz project that the on-chain market for tokenized real-world assets (RWA) could reach as much as $30 trillion by 2034, according to a joint report from June 26. Researchers calculate that tokenized RWAs, excluding stablecoins, expanded from roughly $5 billion in 2022 to more than $24 billion by June 2025, an 85% year-over-year increase that positions the sector as crypto’s fastest-growing vertical after dollar-pegged tokens. Private credit drives the total with $14 billion outstanding, while tokenized US Treasury vehicles contribute about $7.5 billion, according to rwa.xyz dashboards embedded in the study. The report modeled several adoption curves and concluded that capturing 10 to 30% of global securities and alternative assets between 2030 and 2034 would bring the on-chain figure closer to the $16 trillion to $30 trillion range. The report stated that BlackRock, JPMorgan, Franklin Templeton, and Apollo now issue production-scale funds on public blockchains, signaling that tokenization has progressed from proof of concept to live deployment in under two years. Yield-bearing Treasury tokens, rebasing share classes, and leveraged private credit loops on Morpho and Kamino demonstrate how decentralized finance (DeFi) rails create new distribution channels and liquidity venues for traditionally illiquid instruments. RedStone argued that accurate pricing hinges on oracle architectures that merge net-asset-value snapshots, regulatory attestations, and illiquidity discounts, a framework that departs from the real-time spot feeds common in DeFi. Gauntlet models indicated that private credit could surpass $250 billion on-chain once tokenized loan origination reaches 5% of the $3 trillion global market. In comparison, Treasury-bill tokens could exceed $1 trillion if asset managers allocate 2% of short-duration funds to blockchain rails. The authors forecasted that programmable compliance layers, such as Securitize’s sToken, and increasing regulatory clarity in the United States, Europe, and Asia would enable pension funds and insurers to allocate directly to tokenized products, broadening the addressable base beyond crypto-native capital. RedStone plans to update the market-size tracker quarterly and add live oracle metrics for on-chain RWA indices. At the same time, Gauntlet will release risk-parameter adjustments for leveraged vaults tied to private credit pools. The consortium will host further briefings at the RWA Summit in Cannes on July 1, where it will publish granular inflow data and the methodology underpinning its $30 trillion upper-bound model. The report identified the current $24 billion footprint as roughly 0.006% of the $400 trillion in traditional assets but contends that institutional issuance velocity and programmable settlement advantages justify a $30 trillion scenario within nine years.

AN ONLINE FUNDRAISER to cover the funeral expenses of a teenager who drowned in Co Meath has hit its target ahead of tomorrow’s service. Kofi Jackson Owusu, aged 15 and from the Blackrock area of Dundalk, Co Louth, died last Friday after getting into difficulty in the river Nanny in Laytown, Co Meath. It’s understood that he had jumped into the river with a number of other children from the footbridge in Laytown when he got into difficulty in the river. The principal of Coláiste Chú Chulainn in Dundalk, Thomas Sharkey, said the school was heartbroken over the loss of Kofi. He described Kofi as “very kind and very caring”. Advertisement Kofi had recently played in an All-Ireland basketball final and in a Leinster soccer final in his age group of under-16. He was a member of Redeemer Celtic Football Club in Dundalk and the club started a GoFundMe to support Kofi’s family with funeral costs. The club described Kofi as a “highly respectful youngster” who was a “credit to his loving family”. The online fundraiser has surpassed its goal ahead of Kofi’s funeral service tomorrow. His funeral service will take place at The Redeemed Christian Church of God, Miracle Land, Castletown Road, Dundalk tomorrow at 1pm. Afterwards, the congregation will proceed to St. Patrick’s Cemetery for burial. Readers like you are keeping these stories free for everyone...

Title: Gold is Money Good, Brace for Deep Recession

Skip to comments. Posted on 06/26/2025 9:11:06 AM PDT by delta7 Former Wall Street money manager and financial analyst Ed Dowd of PhinanceTechnologies.com has been forecasting “Danger of Deep Worldwide Recession in 2025.” It looks like his thesis is turning out correct. He predicted interest rates would be declining. They did. And inflation has been going down right along with the economy as illegal immigration was being stopped and deportations ramped up. Dowd says, “Our friend Joe Biden spent anywhere between $500 billion to $2 trillion to bring these people in and set them up. Now, that’s all going the wrong way. Trump has shut down the border crossings, and as deportations heat up, that will only add to the problem. There will be a lot of supply, and prices have already started coming down in certain regions, and that is going to accelerate. Inflation is going to be coming down. Chairman Powell is dead-ass wrong. Tariffs are actually deflationary, and he’s holding rates higher for longer. That is going to end up being a big policy error. We think interest rates have peaked for the year. . .. We think the Fed will be forced to cut rates when the hard data comes in the wrong way.” What is Dowd looking at most? Dowd says, “If we did have an oil shock, our thesis of a deep world-wide recession would trigger even faster. During the last twelve days of this Iran/Israel war, I said to my followers, I am watching one thing and one thing only, and that is the price of oil. The price of oil did go up . . . I said if oil breaks out above $80 per barrel, then we’ve got problems. Oil has collapsed, and the oil markets are telling you the Iranians are not going to close the Strait of Hormuz. So, for now, the economies of the world are not going to be experiencing an oil price shock.” That does not mean we are set for clear sailing throughout 2025. Dowd is forecasting that commercial and residential real estate will be a huge drag on the economy as prices fall and fall hard. Dowd says, “We think shelter is going to trend lower, and there is going to be a deflationary scare coming.” Dowd thinks the Fed will panic and have emergency rate cuts this fall. The stock market will take some big hits. Dowd says, “I think they freak out in the fall in October or November. . .. I will point out airlines have taken out previous lows, homebuilders are weak, the DOW Jones transports are not close to all-time highs. The real economy is rolling over. Typically, when bubbles like this end, everyone is on the wrong side of the trade, and it’s going to happen quick. . .. Warren Buffett is telling you everything you need to know about this market.” Buffett has reportedly $350 billion in cash on the sidelines. Dowd favors gold because the big banks like gold. Dowd says, “Gold counts as a quasi-asset because it is a Tier 1 asset. That means they can create loans against that as an asset whereas before you couldn’t. It was not Tier 1. This is going to be misunderstood by a lot of people, and gold is now a big deal again. . .. If I am a long-term investor, I am going to do what the banks are doing. They have made gold money again. So, gold is money good . . . I am going to go with what the banks are buying.” Dowd wrote a popular book called “Cause Unknown,” which tracked the deaths and injuries that started after the CV19 vax rollout in 2021. He’s still tracking the injuries that just added another 700,000 disabled people. Since the CV19 injections started, that’s a hit a new high of 5.5 million permanently disabled Americans. Dowd says, “This looks like a bullish trend that isn’t stopping anytime soon. It goes up to a new high, consolidates and breaks out again. If this was a growth stock, I’d be all over it, and I’d be long disability. . .. the meta data, the big data, says something drastically changed in 2021. It’s a disaster. I think it’s the CV19 vaccine. I find it interesting there is no curiosity about this even with the new administration. It’s an elephant in the room, and they don’t want to talk about it.” There is much more in the 46-minute interview.

Dowd says, “If we did have an oil shock, our thesis of a deep world-wide recession would trigger even faster. During the last twelve days of this Iran/Israel war, I said to my followers, I am watching one thing and one thing only, and that is the price of oil. The price of oil did go up . . . I said if oil breaks out above $80 per barrel, then we’ve got problems. Oil has collapsed, and the oil markets are telling you the Iranians are not going to close the Strait of Hormuz. So, for now, the economies of the world are not going to be experiencing an oil price shock.” That does not mean we are set for clear sailing throughout 2025. Dowd is forecasting that commercial and residential real estate will be a huge drag on the economy as prices fall and fall hard. Dowd says, “We think shelter is going to trend lower, and there is going to be a deflationary scare coming.” Dowd thinks the Fed will panic and have emergency rate cuts this fall. The stock market will take some big hits. Dowd says, “I think they freak out in the fall in October or November. . .. I will point out airlines have taken out previous lows, homebuilders are weak, the DOW Jones transports are not close to all-time highs. The real economy is rolling over. Typically, when bubbles like this end, everyone is on the wrong side of the trade, and it’s going to happen quick. . .. Warren Buffett is telling you everything you need to know about this market.” Buffett has reportedly $350 billion in cash on the sidelines. Dowd favors gold because the big banks like gold. Dowd says, “Gold counts as a quasi-asset because it is a Tier 1 asset. That means they can create loans against that as an asset whereas before you couldn’t. It was not Tier 1. This is going to be misunderstood by a lot of people, and gold is now a big deal again. . .. If I am a long-term investor, I am going to do what the banks are doing. They have made gold money again. So, gold is money good . . . I am going to go with what the banks are buying.” Dowd wrote a popular book called “Cause Unknown,” which tracked the deaths and injuries that started after the CV19 vax rollout in 2021. He’s still tracking the injuries that just added another 700,000 disabled people. Since the CV19 injections started, that’s a hit a new high of 5.5 million permanently disabled Americans. Dowd says, “This looks like a bullish trend that isn’t stopping anytime soon. It goes up to a new high, consolidates and breaks out again. If this was a growth stock, I’d be all over it, and I’d be long disability. . .. the meta data, the big data, says something drastically changed in 2021. It’s a disaster. I think it’s the CV19 vaccine. I find it interesting there is no curiosity about this even with the new administration. It’s an elephant in the room, and they don’t want to talk about it.” There is much more in the 46-minute interview.

This is going to be misunderstood by a lot of people, and gold is now a big deal again. . .. If I am a long-term investor, I am going to do what the banks are doing. They have made gold money again. So, gold is money good . . . I am going to go with what the banks are buying.” Dowd wrote a popular book called “Cause Unknown,” which tracked the deaths and injuries that started after the CV19 vax rollout in 2021. He’s still tracking the injuries that just added another 700,000 disabled people. Since the CV19 injections started, that’s a hit a new high of 5.5 million permanently disabled Americans. Dowd says, “This looks like a bullish trend that isn’t stopping anytime soon. It goes up to a new high, consolidates and breaks out again. If this was a growth stock, I’d be all over it, and I’d be long disability. . .. the meta data, the big data, says something drastically changed in 2021. It’s a disaster. I think it’s the CV19 vaccine. I find it interesting there is no curiosity about this even with the new administration.

Title: NATO’s 5 percent spending pledge is a threat to people and the planet
URL: https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2025/6/26/natos-5-percent-spending-pledge-is-a-threat-to-people-and-the-planet
Time Published: 2025-06-26T13:32:50Z
Full Content:
The alliance’s spending surge will prompt war, cut services and worsen the climate crisis. NATO’s leaders agreed this week to invest 5 percent of their countries’ gross domestic product (GDP) on “core defence requirements as well as defence and security-related spending by 2035”. NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte called it a “quantum leap” in spending that would guarantee “freedom and security” for the military alliance’s one billion people. It certainly is historic in terms of military escalation, but will it deliver security – and if so, for whom? The headline demand for 5 percent GDP spending has been so loud, it’s easy to forget that for a long time, many NATO members considered the previous 2 percent goal either unachievable or unimportant. NATO first committed to its 2 percent GDP goal in 2002, but by 2021, only six of its members had achieved it. Yet three years later, 23 members had met the goal and all 32 are expected to comply by the end of 2025. This week, NATO has committed to more than doubling its spending to 5 percent of GDP. This will be partly met through creative accounting and reflects a desire to trumpet a big number to satisfy a petulant President Trump. The 5 percent headline includes 1.5 percent spent on military-related infrastructure, which could be broadly defined to include civilian expenditure. Even so, it reflects a huge escalation of military expenditure over the next decade from an already very high level. Last year, NATO spent $1.5 trillion on the military – more than half of global military spending. If members comply with the core 3.5 percent target by 2030, that would mean a total of $13.4 trillion in military expenditure. It’s an impossible figure to grasp, but if you stacked it in one-dollar bills, you could make almost four piles that reach the moon. It could also be distributed as a one-off cash bonus of $1,674 to every person on the planet. In reality, the money will be diverted – most of all from social and environmental spending – even though 30 percent of Europeans report difficulty in making ends meet and climate scientists warn that we have two years left to keep temperature increases below the international target of 1.5 degrees Celsius (34.7 degrees Fahrenheit). Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, who fought for a partial exemption from the 5 percent goal, was the most honest about this costly trade-off: “If we had accepted 5 percent, Spain would have to spend by 2035 an extra 300 billion euros on defence. Where would it come from? From cuts in health and education.” Social and environmental spending is already on the chopping block. In February, the United Kingdom announced it would reduce its aid budget to 0.3 percent of GDP to pay for military spending increases – a year after it won an election committing to increase foreign aid. Belgium, the Netherlands and France followed suit, announcing aid cuts of 25 to 37 percent. The United States, under Trump, has decimated its overseas aid and climate programmes and reduced healthcare funding while proposing a record $1 trillion expenditure on the Pentagon. Europe is falling far behind on its own environmental and social goals, with its primary funding vehicle, the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF), expiring in 2026. The European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC) concludes that most European NATO members will be unable to meet the 3.5 percent NATO target without cutting budgets, raising taxes or changing fiscal rules. NATO’s spending spree will not only divert money – it will worsen the climate crisis. As one of the world’s biggest carbon polluters, it is investing in more gas-guzzling jets, tanks and missiles. Military emissions are notoriously hard to track due to limited data, but one report estimates that 3.5 percent of GDP spending would lead to 2,330 million metric tonnes of greenhouse gases by 2030 – roughly the same as the combined annual emissions of Brazil and Japan. NATO’s justification is that increased investment is needed to confront the threats of “Russia” and “terrorism”. Yet there is no rationale behind the 5 percent target or details on why threats to NATO have so drastically increased. Nor is there self-examination on how NATO’s actions partly set the stage for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Russia has increased military spending, but it still spends 10 times less than NATO. Nor could it catch up militarily with NATO’s 32-strong alliance, given its economy: $2 trillion in 2024 (nominal GDP), compared with $26 trillion for non-US NATO countries and $29 trillion for the US alone. As for “terrorism”, the idea that NATO’s increased spending could deter it ignores the failures of the “War on Terror”, where NATO interventions in Afghanistan and Libya prompted instability and fighter recruitment. The security NATO seems most concerned with is that of its arms firms. Long before Trump’s pressure, arms firms have pushed for higher European military spending through lobbying groups like the AeroSpace and Defence Industries Association of Europe (ASD). They have successfully made military security an overriding European Union objective, winning ever more public money for research and industry support. Now they are reaping the rewards with booming revenues and profits. Before the NATO summit, BlackRock released an investment report celebrating the arms industry as a “dynamic growth industry” and a “mega force” that will drive investment trends in the coming years. NATO’s idea of security diverts money from social needs, worsens the climate crisis, rewards arms firms profiting from global conflict, and chooses war over diplomacy. Its bellicose stance in The Hague this week makes it one of the greatest threats to global security – even to life on this planet. It is up to the peoples of NATO countries to reject this deadly path and reclaim security based on cooperation, justice and peace.

Luxembourg-based Quintet Private Bank, with operations across Europe and the UK, has integrated private markets exposure into its client portfolios. Clients with relevant portfolios can now access actively managed exposure to alternative assets, including private equity, private credit, and real assets. The gold standard of business intelligence. Find out more These are offered through selected evergreen private markets funds, complementing traditional allocations to equities, fixed income, and commodities. This integration was facilitated by a collaboration with BlackRock and the implementation of the European Long-Term Investment Funds (ELTIF 2.0) framework, effective since last year. This framework reduces liquidity and operational constraints, enabling continuous capital raising, reinvestment, and flexible redemptions. This allows investors to access private markets with simplicity and efficiency similar to traditional public markets. Don’t let policy changes catch you off guard. Stay proactive with real-time data and expert analysis. Bryan Crawford, group head of investment & client solutions and member of the Authorized Management Committee at Quintet, said: “Diversification is a cornerstone of portfolio resilience, especially during periods of heightened volatility. “We are therefore delighted to partner with BlackRock to integrate exposure to private markets in client portfolios, supporting increased diversification and creating new opportunities to access long-term growth themes.” Quintet’s private markets offering includes BlackRock’s private markets platform, which manages over €600bn in assets pro forma across multi-alternatives and private equity strategies for investors in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia-Pacific. BlackRock EMEA Wealth Alternatives Specialists Team head Fabio Osta said: “By supporting the integration of private markets into wealth portfolios, we are making investing in alternatives easier and more accessible for a broader range of investors so they can benefit from the typically higher returns and diversification the asset class offers.” This announcement follows Quintet’s launch of multi-manager UCITS funds last year, also co-designed with BlackRock. These actively managed, single-asset-class funds, exclusive to Quintet clients, combine third-party managers to enhance diversification and portfolio performance. Earlier this year, Quintet introduced Future+, a sustainable investment mandate developed with BlackRock, adhering to its environmental, social, and governance (ESG) principles.

The 10 models are the first to be added to CAIS's recently launched Models Marketplace and feature substantial exposure to private markets. June 25, 2025 Alternative investment platform CAIS unveiled the first investment models to be added to its recently launched CAIS Models Marketplace. The new line-up includes multi-asset model portfolios, three each from BlackRock, Carlyle and KKR, and one multi-asset, multi-manager model from Franklin Templeton. The announcement comes amid a boom in model portfolio adoption across the RIA universe. As financial advisors increasingly look for model portfolios with private market exposure, both asset managers and various investment platforms are rushing to meet the demand. For example, last week, wealth management platform Envestnet revealed it was adding models with private market exposure options from Fidelity, BlackRock, Franklin Templeton and State Street Global Advisors. Last year, alternative investment platform iCapital launched its first model portfolio, with access to private equity, private credit and real assets. BlackRock’s models will combine exposure to public and private markets with allocations to public equities, public debt, private equity and private credit through select BlackRock investment vehicles. The assets in the model will run across the risk spectrum. Carlyle’s models will target private equity and private credit, focusing on enhanced returns, supplemental income and capital preservation. Related:RIAs and the Evolving Landscape of Private Wealth KKR’s models will allocate to private equity, private credit, private real estate and private infrastructure. They will also focus on generating income, enhanced returns and capital preservation. Franklin Templeton’s model will invest in private markets, including private credit, private real estate, infrastructure, secondaries, co-investments and asset-backed finance. These investment options will be accessed through Alternatives by Franklin Templeton and select third-party partners. “Alternative investment models give advisors a powerful tool to deliver more personalized portfolios, while helping to streamline operational complexity and scale allocations,” said Neil Blundell, chief investment officer at CAIS Advisors and head of investments at CAIS, in a statement. “By packaging multiple alternative investment strategies into a single, professionally designed solution, advisors can focus more on their clients and less on manager selection.” Elaine Misonzhnik Senior Editor, Investments, WealthManagement.com Elaine Misonzhnik is Senior Editor, Investments at WealthManagement.com, focusing on alternative investments. She has over 20 years of experience as a business reporter and editor, including for Retail Traffic and National Real Estate Investor magazines.
