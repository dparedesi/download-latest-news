Resilience is an important character trait for any sportsperson, one that Ireland scrumhalf Aoibheann Reilly has displayed in battling back from not one but two ACL surgeries, one on each knee. The 24-year-old from Ballinasloe made her return to Test rugby off the bench in Ireland’s defeat to France last weekend. On Sunday in Parma she’ll start, forming a halfback partnership with Dannah O’Brien. Reilly tore the ACL in her right knee three years ago. The second time was while playing Sevens for Ireland in Madrid in the build-up to the Olympics, shattering a dream. While the injuries were the same the rehabilitation process differed from a mindset perspective. She explained: “First time around I was 21 and hadn’t played a whole lot for Ireland. So, I don’t know if I had that pressure on me to go back. “My rehab process was a bit longer, but this is a World Cup year, and I knew I needed to get back and get game time under my belt, especially after spending so long in Sevens. I was very focused, worked with some great physios to get me back fit and ready to perform. “It was a very emotional moment standing there for the anthems [last week in Belfast]. When I tore my ACL for the second time, before the Olympics last summer, I was just focusing on getting back for that France game. I knew that everything had to go right in my rehab journey to get back on the pitch, so it was a big moment for me and my family just wearing the green again.” She returned to the match arena in a little over eight months, the second time, playing a couple of games for the Clovers in the Celtic Challenge, which facilitated her return to the Irish team. During that absence she did come co-comms for television, European Challenge Cup games, and also was given a backroom role with Andy Farrell’s men’s squad. She said: “I was very lucky to have been asked to join the men’s team for the November internationals as a support analyst. It was a great way for me to develop my knowledge off-pitch, see how they run things and then also keep learning and growing my rugby IQ while I couldn’t be on-field. That was such a valuable experience and I’m very grateful to the IRFU and to the men’s squad for that. “While I was rehabbing here in HPC I would tailor my days with my physio so I could be there for their big pitch sessions and then I headed over to Portugal for a few days for their pre-camp, which was great. I also shadowed a bit on matchday which was a great insight.” Did she pick up any tips? “Just the way they operate, similar to us, they’re obviously professionals but it was interesting to see how they do things on matchday that are different but also similar to us. Just the level of experience they have in their squad and how they use that, seeing that was very valuable.” Reilly is one of three changes to the team that lost 27-15 to France last week. Ireland head coach Scott Bemand promotes Fiona Tuite, Edel McMahon – she takes over the captaincy – and Reilly from the bench with Dorothy Wall, Brittany Hogan and Emily Lane heading in the opposite direction. Italian head coach Fabio Roselli has made six changes to the side that was beaten 38-5 by England on the opening weekend of the tournament. Hooker Vittoria Vecchini, Gaia Maris, Sara Tounesi and Emma Stevanin swap the bench for a starting role, while number eight Elisa Giordano and centre Michela Sillari are the other alterations to the run-on team. There are a couple of positional switches with Alyssa D’Inca moving from centre to wing, Francesca Granzotto from wing to fullback and Francesca Sgorbini from number eight to flanker. Italy are looking for a hat-trick of wins over Ireland in the Six Nations, having won just one of the previous 16 matches between the sides. Ireland have lost 10 of their last 11 away games, including the previous seven, a streak they’d dearly love to break. There were aspects of the Irish performance last week that were promising but what can’t continue is the number of basic errors. Getting players on the ball like Aoife Wafer, Amee-Leigh Costigan, Stacey Flood, Linda Djougang, Aoife Dalton, Erin King who can break a game open is important but so too is a progression in quality in terms of the collective output. Do that and anything is possible. Italy: F Granzotto; A Muzzo, M Sillari, B Rigoni, A D’Inca; E Stevanin, S Stefan; S Turani, V Vecchini, G Maris; V Fedrighi, G Duca; S Tounesi, F Sgorbini, E Giordano.

Title: Panama Ports Deal on the Verge of Falling Apart Because of Chinese Government Opposition

Skip to comments. Posted on 03/28/2025 9:42:57 PM PDT by SeekAndFind The Chinese government has intervened to stop the planned April 2 sale of two Panama Canal ports owned by the Hong Kong conglomerate CK Hutchinson to the US-based conglomerate Black Rock. CK Hutchinson operates two of the five ports adjacent to the Panama Canal. Panama first awarded the company the concession to run the ports in 1998 and extended it for another 25 years in 2021. The Canal is a major maritime chokepoint and manages about 3% of the global maritime trade. The issue of Chinese ownership of critical ports serving the Panama Canal predates President Trump's second term; see Does China Run the Canal? – RedState. The administration launched a full-court diplomatic press that got Panama to withdraw from China's Belt and Road Initiative; see UPDATED: Trump Admin. Lays Down the Law Over Panama Canal, Sets Up Major Confrontation; Panama Folds – RedState and Panama Capitulates - Will Not Renew 2017 Deal With China. What's Next? – RedState. That led to an agreement by CK Hutchinson to sell its Panama facilities to Black Rock. This seemed like an early diplomatic win for President Trump; see China's Out: American Company Taking Control of Panama Canal Ports – RedState.Selling the Canal ports did not prove as popular in Beijing as in Washington. Over the past two weeks, pro-Beijing Hong Kong newspaper Ta Kung Pao has published a series of commentaries criticising the deal for harming China's national interests and depicting it as a betrayal of China and is a "perfect cooperation" with the U.S. strategy to contain China.China's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office reposted some of the commentaries on its website, which fueled speculation Beijing could take steps to try to scupper the sale.China's President Xi Jinping is reportedly angry about the deal. He saw Chinese ownership of the ports as a poke in the eye of American power and a bargaining chip in possible tariff negotiations.Now, Chinese antitrust regulators (yes, I did lol writing that) have been unleashed on the deal, which is much larger than two Panamanian ports.The sale of CK Hutchison’s two ports at each end of the Panama Canal was part of a US$23 billion dollar deal to sell 45 ports spread over 23 countries to a consortium led by United States investment firm BlackRock. CK Hutchison will pocket US$19 billion.“We have noticed this transaction, and will review it in accordance with the law to ensure fair competition in the market and safeguard the public interest,” a spokesman from the anti-monopoly department under the market regulator said in a written reply.The watchdog did not reveal when the investigation would be launched.The department is responsible for conducting antitrust reviews and providing guidance to companies over their response to mitigate risk and ensure compliance overseas.The deal may go through, but Black Rock may not end up with the ports. Though some sources say that talks are still underway between Black Rock and CK Hutchinson, nothing indicates this is anything more than wishcasting. Xi dislikes the deal; the sale has been denounced as a betrayal of China by the state press, and selling the ports to an American company is a blow to Chinese prestige, particularly in the context of Panama being offered a "deal it couldn't refuse" to leave the Belt and Road Initiative. CK Hitchinson is reportedly in talks with the Swiss-based Mediterranean Shipping Company, the world’s biggest container shipping operator that runs dozens of terminals globally. This would remove the point of friction of Chinese ownership without allowing Trump to claim victory.

The administration launched a full-court diplomatic press that got Panama to withdraw from China's Belt and Road Initiative; see UPDATED: Trump Admin. Lays Down the Law Over Panama Canal, Sets Up Major Confrontation; Panama Folds – RedState and Panama Capitulates - Will Not Renew 2017 Deal With China. What's Next? – RedState. That led to an agreement by CK Hutchinson to sell its Panama facilities to Black Rock. This seemed like an early diplomatic win for President Trump; see China's Out: American Company Taking Control of Panama Canal Ports – RedState.Selling the Canal ports did not prove as popular in Beijing as in Washington. Over the past two weeks, pro-Beijing Hong Kong newspaper Ta Kung Pao has published a series of commentaries criticising the deal for harming China's national interests and depicting it as a betrayal of China and is a "perfect cooperation" with the U.S. strategy to contain China.China's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office reposted some of the commentaries on its website, which fueled speculation Beijing could take steps to try to scupper the sale.China's President Xi Jinping is reportedly angry about the deal. He saw Chinese ownership of the ports as a poke in the eye of American power and a bargaining chip in possible tariff negotiations.Now, Chinese antitrust regulators (yes, I did lol writing that) have been unleashed on the deal, which is much larger than two Panamanian ports.The sale of CK Hutchison’s two ports at each end of the Panama Canal was part of a US$23 billion dollar deal to sell 45 ports spread over 23 countries to a consortium led by United States investment firm BlackRock. CK Hutchison will pocket US$19 billion.“We have noticed this transaction, and will review it in accordance with the law to ensure fair competition in the market and safeguard the public interest,” a spokesman from the anti-monopoly department under the market regulator said in a written reply.The watchdog did not reveal when the investigation would be launched.The department is responsible for conducting antitrust reviews and providing guidance to companies over their response to mitigate risk and ensure compliance overseas.The deal may go through, but Black Rock may not end up with the ports. Though some sources say that talks are still underway between Black Rock and CK Hutchinson, nothing indicates this is anything more than wishcasting. Xi dislikes the deal; the sale has been denounced as a betrayal of China by the state press, and selling the ports to an American company is a blow to Chinese prestige, particularly in the context of Panama being offered a "deal it couldn't refuse" to leave the Belt and Road Initiative.

Title: BlackRock’s bold bet lifts Solana sentiment to record levels – Could SOL surge next?
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/blackrocks-bold-bet-lifts-solana-sentiment-to-record-levels-could-sol-surge-next/
Time Published: 2025-03-29T03:00:35Z
Full Content:
SOL’s social sentiment is soaring on BlackRock and GameStop news, but price action signals caution. What’s next for Solana? Solana [SOL] has become the center of attention in the crypto market, riding a fresh wave of optimism fueled by institutional interest. With BlackRock launching yield-bearing tokenized treasury funds on the network and GameStop integrating Bitcoin through Solana’s [SOL] infrastructure, sentiment around SOL has surged to unprecedented levels. But will this social momentum translate into a price breakout? Data from Santiment reveals a sharp spike in Solana’s Positive/Negative Sentiment Ratio, climbing to 32.87 – far outpacing sentiment levels around Bitcoin [BTC], Ethereum [ETH], and Ripple[XRP]. This sharp divergence underscores a unique bullish tilt for SOL on social platforms, suggesting growing investor confidence. Source: Santiment The spike coincides with BlackRock’s strategic use of Solana’s infrastructure and GameStop’s broader crypto pivot, both of which have been heavily amplified by influencers and community support. This fusion of technological utility and mainstream integration has created the perfect storm for a sentiment-driven rally. Despite the sentiment frenzy, Solana’s price action is flashing caution. At the time of writing, SOL was trading at $132.49, registering a 4.27% intraday dip. The 50-day Moving Average (MA) at $133.74 has acted as a key resistance level, while the 200-day MA at $183.04 loomed far above, highlighting how much ground SOL needs to reclaim for a true trend reversal. Source: TradingView At press time, the Bollinger Bands were tightening, reflecting contracting volatility. Meanwhile, the Average True Range (ATR) sat at 6.18, suggesting that SOL remains in a low-volatility regime – a potential prelude to an explosive move in either direction. SOL’s price pattern indicates consolidation rather than a breakout despite the overly bullish sentiment among traders. This disparity suggests a potential disconnect between emotional optimism and technical resistance levels. Historically, such euphoria can be risky, especially when unsupported by volume and price action. However, Solana’s robust developer ecosystem and real-world applications in tokenized finance, like BlackRock’s recent initiative, offer solid fundamentals. If SOL surpasses the $140 mark and turns its short-term resistance into support, a rapid upward movement could follow, fueled by persistent social sentiment.

Title: Fidelity says Bitcoin could potentially overtake gold, echoing Saylor’s absorption theory

Fidelity's cautious view contrasts with Saylor's optimism as both eye Bitcoin's trajectory amid growing institutional support. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Fidelity Investments director of global macro Jurrien Timmer believes that Bitcoin (BTC) has a “possible” path to surpassing gold in market value — but “not any time soon.” In a detailed social media post, Timmer explained his view using a chart comparing the projected growth of gold and Bitcoin over time. He noted that if gold continues to grow at its historical compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8% — a trend seen since 1970 — and Bitcoin follows either a power law adoption curve or the internet’s S-curve growth model, the two could converge within the next 10 to 20 years. Timmer wrote: “If Bitcoin grows at the rate suggested by these two models, then hard money is likely winning the race, which suggests that gold will be appreciating faster than 8% per year. So, my guess is that gold will always be Bitcoin’s quieter older sibling.” The prediction is much more cautious than forecasts shared by other industry leaders like Galaxy and Strategy founder Michael Saylor. Timmer’s comments come amid significant volatility in crypto markets. Bitcoin fell below $84,000 again on March 28, equating to a roughly 33% decline against gold since its December peak. The price struggles come as inflation concerns and trade tensions continue to weigh on risk assets amid the subdued market sentiment. Meanwhile, gold continues to reach new all-time highs, reinforcing its long-standing role as a safe haven. Despite Bitcoin’s price decline, major institutions continue to show confidence in the asset. On March 27, Fidelity and BlackRock drove a combined $89 million into Bitcoin ETFs, led by Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), which saw $97.1 million in inflows. The continued capital injection signals growing institutional conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term prospects — even as near-term price action paints a more bearish picture. While Timmer offered a measured take, Strategy founder Michael Saylor recently presented a far more aggressive forecast. Speaking at the DC Blockchain Summit on March 28, Saylor predicted Bitcoin’s market cap could soar to $500 trillion as it absorbs value from traditional assets like gold, real estate, and even sovereign wealth. Saylor argued that Bitcoin is replacing “20th-century assets” with a digital, decentralized, inflation-resistant alternative. He compared the shift to historic changes in monetary systems — like European colonizers introducing coinage to societies that used beads or shells. Saylor added that the US has the “opportunity to grab” 25% to 30% of global Bitcoin value once the “dust settles” from this asset reorganization. Still, the debate is clearly shifting. As more institutional money flows in and long-term models project exponential adoption, the conversation is no longer whether Bitcoin belongs in the same conversation as gold — but when and under what conditions it might catch up. For now, Fidelity’s Timmer urged caution and said the flippening is “possible,” but gold — steady, quiet, and time-tested — still holds the upper hand.

Title: “This Is Existential”: Billionaire Cancer Researcher Says Covid & Vaccine Likely Causing Surge In Aggressive Cancers

DON'T GET LEFT OUT: HUNTER MUST BE STOPPED! by Contributing Author | Mar 28, 2025 | Health | 0 comments This article was originally published by Tyler Durden at ZeroHedge. Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong – a transplant surgeon-turned-biotech billionaire renowned for inventing the cancer drug Abraxane – has issued a startling warning in a new in-depth interview with Tucker Carlson. Soon-Shiong, founder of ImmunityBio ($IBRX) and owner of the Los Angeles Times, claims that the COVID-19 pandemic, and the very vaccines developed to fight it, may be contributing to a global surge in “terrifyingly aggressive” cancers. In the nearly two-hour conversation, the Los Angeles Times owner leveraged his decades of clinical and scientific experience to outline why he suspects an unprecedented cancer epidemic is unfolding. This report examines Dr. Soon-Shiong’s background and assertions, the scientific responses for and against his claims, new data on post-COVID health trends, and the far-reaching implications if his alarming hypothesis proves true. Soon-Shiong is a veteran surgeon and immunologist who has spent a career studying the human immune system’s fight against cancer. He pioneered novel immunotherapies and even worked on a T-cell based COVID vaccine booster during the pandemic. In the interview, he draws on this background to voice deep concern over rising cancer cases, especially among younger people – something he describes as a “non-infectious pandemic” of cancer. He tells Carlson that in 50 years of medical practice, it was extraordinarily rare to see cancers like pancreatic tumors in children or young adults, yet recently such cases are appearing. For instance, Soon-Shiong was alarmed by seeing a 13-year-old with metastatic pancreatic cancer, a scenario virtually unheard of in his prior experience. “I never saw pancreatic cancer in children… the greatest surprise to me was a 13-year-old with metastatic pancreatic cancer,” Soon-Shiong told Carlson, adding that he’s seen examples of very young patients (even children under 11 with colon cancer) and unusual surges in aggressive diseases like ovarian cancer in women in their 30s. These personal observations of more frequent, aggressive cancers in youth led him to probe what might have changed in recent years. “We’re clearly seeing an increase in certain types of cancer, like pancreatic cancer, ovarian cancer… colon cancer… in younger people.” — Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong According Soon-Shiong, the COVID era is the obvious change – and suggests that both the SARS-CoV-2 virus infection and the widespread vaccination campaigns could be key drivers behind this cancer spike. He emphasizes the massive scale of human exposure to the virus and its spike protein (via infection or vaccination). “I don’t know how to say that without saying it. It scares the pants off me because I think what we may be, I don’ think it’s virus versus man now, this is existential. I think when I talk about the largest non-infectious pandemic that we’re afraid of, this is it.” “Billions of people – literally billions – had the COVID virus. Over a billion got the spike protein vaccine,” said Carlson, adding “So that’s like, we’re talking like a huge percentage of the Earth’s population, unless I’m missing something.” “Now you understand what keeps you awake at night and kept me awake at night for two years, two and a half years,” Soon-Shiong replied, suggesting that exposure to both is silently undermining the immune system’s natural defenses against cancer on a global scale. Soon-Shiong frames COVID-era cancers as potentially virally triggered or exacerbated. In the interview, he described cases of “virally induced cancers” in clinics during the pandemic – patients whose cancers may have been kicked into overdrive by the cascade of inflammation and immune stress associated with COVID-19 (Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong: You’re Being Lied to About Cancer, How It’s Caused, and How to Stop It). COVID infection causes a massive inflammatory response, and some cancers are known to exploit inflammation to grow. TUCKER: “a lot people have pointed to both COVID, the virus, and to the mRNA COVID vaccines as potential causes. Do you think that they’re related?“ SOON-SHIONG: “The best way for me to answer that is to look at history. What we know about virally-induced cancers is well-established. We know that if you get hepatitis, you get liver cancer. Hepatitis is a virus infection. We know if you got human papillomavirus, HPV, you get cervical cancer.” We know that certain viruses directly cause cancer (e.g. HPV, Epstein-Barr), so it’s not unprecedented for a virus to play a role in oncogenesis. While SARS-CoV-2 is not a known oncovirus, Soon-Shiong worries its indirect effects – chronic inflammation, immune exhaustion, or “suppressor cells” that emerge in the wake of infection/vaccination – could be accelerating tumor development. “The answer is to stop the inflammation…clear the virus from the body,” he argues, positing that until we eradicate the lingering virus and restore immune balance, we may see mounting cancer cases. * * * Fight inflammation with IQ Biologix (super potent) Ultra Turmeric In sum, Dr. Soon-Shiong’s claim is that the pandemic has set the stage for an explosion of aggressive cancers: the COVID virus itself (especially if it persists in survivors) might suppress immune surveillance, and the mRNA vaccines “that didn’t stop it” might inadvertently contribute to an immunosuppressive environment. These effects, in his theory, could be unleashing cancers that the immune system would ordinarily have kept in check. Watch: A number of clinicians and researchers have reported similar worrying observations, though these remain largely anecdotal at this stage. One prominent voice echoing Soon-Shiong’s concern is Dr. Angus Dalgleish, a veteran oncologist and professor at St. George’s, University of London. In late 2022, Dalgleish wrote to the BMJ’s editor after noticing that some cancer patients who had been stable for years experienced “rapid progression of their disease after a COVID-19 booster.” He cited cases of individuals who were doing well until shortly after vaccination – new leukemias, sudden appearance of Stage IV lymphomas, and explosive metastases in patients who had post-vaccine bouts of feeling unwell. “I am experienced enough to know that these are not coincidental,” Dalgleish wrote, noting that colleagues in Germany, Australia, and the U.S. were independently seeing the same pattern. This frontline testimony aligns with Soon-Shiong’s fear: something about the immune system post-vaccination might be removing restraints on latent cancers. Dalgleish specifically pointed to short-term innate immune suppression after mRNA vaccination (lasting for several weeks) as a plausible mechanism. Many of the cancers he saw were ones normally held in check by immune surveillance (melanomas and B-cell cancers), so a temporary post-vaccine drop in immune vigilance could allow a tumor growth spurt. He also alluded to “suppressor gene suppression by mRNA in laboratory experiments” – a reference to preliminary studies that found the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein might interfere with key DNA repair or tumor-suppressor proteins in cells. These lab findings (while not yet confirmed in living organisms) lend some biological plausibility to the idea that spike exposure could affect cancer-related pathways. Beyond individual doctors, some research is probing links between COVID and cancer behavior. For example, a 2022 study in Frontiers in Oncology explored how SARS-CoV-2 proteins interact with cancer cells. It found that the virus’s membrane (M) protein can “induce the mobility, proliferation and in vivo metastasis” of triple-negative breast cancer cells in the lab (Frontiers | SARS-CoV-2 M Protein Facilitates Malignant Transformation of Breast Cancer Cells). In co-culture experiments, breast cancer cells exposed to the viral protein essentially became more aggressive and invasive. The researchers concluded that COVID-19 infection “might promote…aggressive [cancer] phenotypes” and warned that cancer patients who get COVID could face worse outcomes. While this is one specific context (breast cancer cells and one viral protein), it underpins Soon-Shiong’s general concern: the virus can directly alter the tumor microenvironment to the cancer’s advantage. Another line of evidence involves latent viruses and inflammation. Doctors have documented unusual reactivations of viruses like Epstein-Barr (which is linked to lymphomas and other malignancies) during both COVID-19 and post-vaccine immune reactions. Such reactivations hint at a period of immune dysregulation that might also let nascent cancer cells slip past defenses. Or course,fact-checkers and medical authorities argue that there is no credible evidence of vaccines causing meaningful immune suppression. “There isn’t evidence to date that COVID-19 vaccines cause cancer or lead to worsening cancer,” one infectious disease expert told FactCheck.org, though they do acknowledge rare side effects like myocarditis or blood clots were found, but not cancer. While the scientific community debates mechanistic links between COVID and cancer, independent analysts have been parsing population-level data for unusual patterns. One notable effort is by Phinance Technologies, a research firm co-founded by former BlackRock portfolio manager Edward Dowd. Phinance has been analyzing excess mortality and disability data since the pandemic, looking for signals of broad health impacts in the aftermath of COVID and mass vaccination. Their findings reveal concerning trends, especially among younger, working-age populations, that lend some weight to Dr. Soon-Shiong’s general warning of a post-COVID health crisis (though not specific to cancer alone). Phinance’s “Vaccine Damage Project” examined the U.S. population aged 16–64 (essentially the workforce) and stratified outcomes into four groups: no effect, mild injuries, severe injuries (disabilities), and death. Using official government databases (the CDC, Bureau of Labor Statistics, etc.), they estimated how each category changed starting in 2021 – when vaccines rolled out and COVID became widespread. The results are sobering. According to Phinance’s analysis, by the end of 2022 the U.S. had experienced approximately 310,000 excess deaths among adults aged 25-64 (a ~23% increase in mortality in that group over normal expectations). Notably, they argue that after mid-2021, with vaccines available and the virus itself becoming less deadly (due to immunity and milder variants), COVID-19 should not have been causing such high excess death rates. Therefore, those 310k “unexplained” deaths in 2021–2022 could represent an upper bound on vaccine-related fatalities or other pandemic collateral damage. Even more striking is the data on new disabilities. Phinance found that from early 2021 through late 2022, about 1.36 million additional Americans (age 16–64) became disabled – a 24.6% rise in disability in that cohort, far above historical trend. This jump in disabilities among the workforce correlates in time with the vaccine rollout (and was disproportionately higher in the labor force than among those not working). The analysts note that the healthiest segment of the population (employed working-age adults) saw a greater relative increase in disabilities after Q1 2021 than the older or non-working groups. This is unusual, since typically health shocks hit the elderly hardest – but here something was impacting younger, healthy people to a significant degree. Phinance investigated further and found a tight relationship between the cumulative number of vaccine doses administered and the rise in disabilities in 2021-22. In fact, for the 16–64 population, they computed a ratio of about 4 new disabilities per excess death in that period, suggesting many survivors were left with lingering health issues even if they didn’t die.

By Todd Spangler NY Digital Editor Wait — Elon Musk just sold X, the social network formerly known as Twitter, to himself? Well, kind of. Musk, in a post on X Friday, said that his artificial-intelligence company, xAI, has acquired X in an all-stock transaction that values X at $33 billion ($45 billion minus $12 billion in debt). The deal gives xAI a valuation of $80 billion, Musk claimed. Musk acquired Twitter in October 2022 for $44 billion and took the company private. What’s going on here? With the sale of X to xAI, Musk is merging the investor base of the social network with that of his AI company (some of which the two companies have in common). Musk had previously said that investors in X Corp. will own 25% of xAI. Related Stories VIP+ ‘Mickey 17’ Is Just the First Big Risk Warner Bros.

Musk, in his post, said that X has more than 600 million active users. “xAI and X’s futures are intertwined. Today, we officially take the step to combine the data, models, compute, distribution and talent,” he wrote. Musk claimed that the combination “will unlock immense potential by blending xAI’s advanced AI capability and expertise with X’s massive reach. The combined company will deliver smarter, more meaningful experiences to billions of people while staying true to our core mission of seeking truth and advancing knowledge. This will allow us to build a platform that doesn’t just reflect the world but actively accelerates human progress.” In addition to his business activities, which include serving as CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, Musk is the head of President Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency.

Rarely if ever have six teams still been in the hunt for play-off places entering the penultimate round of the Energia All-Ireland League Division 1A, but seldom has there been such an unpredictable and competitive top flight. Nowhere are the stakes higher than at Ballymacarn Park where the champions Cork Con go into the last two rounds in third place on 52 points but sit only six points ahead of Ballynahinch in sixth. The home side have Ireland club internationals Conor Rankin, George Pringle, Mark Best and captain Bradley Luney all available, while Conor McKee has been released by Ulster, with Luney moving from 8 to lock. After three successive defeats and a spate of departures, injuries and Leinster absentees, Terenure, in fifth on 48 points and also in must-win mode, host a dangerous Young Munster side at Lakelands Park. After losing outhalf Conor McKeon to a broken leg in last week’s defeat on the Aviva back pitch, Aran Egan shifts to 10 and Adam La Grue to 15, and Terenure do welcome back tow familiar faces in centre Peter Sylvester and winger Caolan Dooley for their first appearances of the season. Sylvester has been living in Miami this season, while Dooley, man of the match when ‘Nure won the final two seasons ago, also went to the US last season and has recovered from a neck injury which required an operation. Lansdowne, the form team in 1A since winning the Bateman Cup in early January, sit fourth on 51 points ahead of their trek to relegation threatened UCD, who are in the relegation play-off spot and trail City of Armagh by two points. Lansdowne are unchanged, while UCD are far from loaded with their Leinster academy players, albeit they do welcome back centre Ben Brownlee, are fighting for their 1A lives and have been something of a bogey side for Lansdowne over the years. Clontarf and St Mary’s, in first and second place on 60 and 58 points, are sitting comparatively pretty. After a highly effective rebuilding job over the last two seasons, a settled and established way of playing which revolves around their power game, Clontarf are guaranteed a semi-final spot, and any kind of win at doomed Garryowen will ensure a home semi-final. True, they are still missing the Soroka brothers, who are with Leinster in South Africa, and Garryowen did end their 14-match losing streak away to City of Armagh last weekend and also welcome back Brian Gleeson. But Connor Fahy is in midfield after his Under-20 Six Nations campaign and it will be a major surprise if Clontarf don’t do enough to earn an advantageous and covetous semi-final at Castle Avenue. In their return to the 1A after a seven-year absence St Mary’s need only a point to ensure their place in the play-offs, and a win against City of Armagh in Templeville Road will also ensure them of a home semi-final. In 1B, Old Wesley and UCC are battling for the last promotion play-off place, while their opponents, Shannon and Highfield, are in a relegation dogfight with Trinity, away to the new champions Old Belvedere.

Ready to uncover the truth? Sick of the lies? Join our Telegram Channel now. It’s time for the real story! My gratitude to all my readers! President Trump just cut all U.S. funding to Bill Gates’ vaccine empire, shutting down GAVI — the globalist-controlled alliance tied to the WHO and WEF. Billions in taxpayer dollars are gone. The medical cartel is cracking. This isn’t policy. This is war. What just happened is not a policy change. It’s a decisive blow — one that tears through the polished veneer of globalist power and strikes at the financial heart of a medical empire built on fear, control, and unaccountable influence. President Donald J. Trump has officially halted all U.S. funding to GAVI, the so-called “vaccine alliance” founded, financed, and politically sustained by Bill Gates and his network of unelected elites. For decades, billions in taxpayer dollars have been funneled into this entity under the justification of public health, global cooperation, and humanitarian aid. But in reality, GAVI has operated as a front for pharmaceutical dominance, a gateway for policy manipulation, and a cash pipeline from sovereign governments to supranational interests. By cutting off this flow, Trump has done what no leader before him dared to do: interrupt the cartel’s revenue stream and expose the true nature of its influence. This isn’t just about funding. It’s about declaring open war on the machinery of control that has held the world hostage under the pretense of saving it. RELATED: BOOM: THE BLACKROCK CARTEL — AMERICA’S MEAT, MEDICINE, AND MONEY UNDER MONOPOLY CONTROL! RFK JR. EXPOSES THE TRUTH — IT’S TIME TO BREAK THEM UP GAVI was never merely an organization focused on vaccines. It became a parallel power structure — one that leveraged Bill Gates’ wealth and ideological reach to influence global health policy at a level previously reserved for sovereign states. Operating under the radar, shielded by its “nonprofit” branding and strategic partnerships with institutions like the World Health Organization, World Bank, and World Economic Forum, GAVI was able to dictate medical priorities on a global scale without facing democratic oversight or public accountability. Through GAVI, Gates positioned himself at the center of a technocratic medical web, funding vaccine development, influencing procurement policies, and using global crises — most notably the COVID-19 pandemic — as a launchpad for consolidating power. In this model, governments became financial donors, not decision-makers. National health agendas were quietly replaced by transnational directives, and public dissent was dismissed as ignorance, conspiracy, or outright danger. Now, with Trump’s funding cut, the illusion of consensus has been shattered. For the first time in decades, America is no longer underwriting its own submission to globalist health doctrine. SEE ALSO: Natural Health: Kill Cancer Cells! Dandelion Root Is Able To Kill 98% Of Cancer Cells Within 48 Hours (video) The American public was led to believe their money was saving lives abroad. In truth, it was being used to entrench a system of soft tyranny — one where medical compliance became currency, and dissenting nations or populations were excluded from aid, access, or participation. Over $2.2 billion in U.S. taxpayer funds have flowed into GAVI, supporting not just vaccine distribution, but also the infrastructure of global surveillance, digital health tracking, and corporate-driven medical enforcement. Under the banner of “health equity,” GAVI helped direct pandemic responses that benefited a handful of pharmaceutical giants, all of which maintained financial ties to Gates’ foundations and investment firms. These companies, shielded from liability, were handed blank checks while public health authorities silenced doctors, crushed early treatment alternatives, and replaced scientific debate with manufactured consensus. In short, GAVI became the financial engine of a global health cartel, and the American taxpayer — unknowingly and unwillingly — was footing the bill. That era is now over. Shocking Secret EXPOSED: Ex-Big Pharma Employee Discovers Breakthrough Formula: EAT THIS ONCE A DAY TO LOWER BLOOD SUGAR BELOW 100 ALL DAY Trump’s move to defund GAVI is not an isolated act of rebellion. It’s part of a broader, calculated offensive against the entire transnational framework that seeks to override national sovereignty through backdoor alliances, private governance, and unelected influence. By targeting GAVI, he has chosen to attack the architecture, not just the propaganda. The decision sends a clear message: America will no longer fund institutions that operate outside of its democratic reach, manipulate its internal policies, or push ideological agendas under humanitarian disguise. GAVI, like the WHO and WEF, is only powerful as long as it controls resources and narratives. Trump’s move destabilizes both. The money stops flowing. The illusion of Western unity breaks. And globalist architects are left scrambling for alternative funding and justification. It’s a strategic unraveling — not through confrontation, but through financial starvation. And in a system built entirely on money and perception, that’s more lethal than any speech or sanction. Few figures symbolize technocratic arrogance and unchecked influence like Bill Gates. With no medical degree, no electoral mandate, and no legal obligation to anyone but his own foundation, he managed to transform himself into the world’s de facto vaccine czar. His influence was never earned — it was bought, protected, and platformed by institutions eager to trade independence for funding. Trump’s move punctures that mythology. It reveals just how fragile their empire really is. Gates’ power depends on access to state funding, access to media amplification, and a global stage that treats money as authority. Now, all three are in jeopardy. In the aftermath of the funding cut, GAVI and its network are rushing to downplay the loss, spin the headlines, and reinforce their image — but the wound is open. The credibility of their entire operation is in question, and without America’s blank check, their influence starts to wither. Trump didn’t just defund a global program. He broke the psychological spell that kept millions convinced they had no choice. He exposed the fragile scaffolding behind Gates’ empire, the WHO’s overreach, and the WEF’s fantasy of medical governance through elite consensus. This is not a one-time victory. It’s a strategic model for how to dismantle every cartel pretending to serve the public while feeding on its resources. Whether it’s food, pharma, or finance — the solution is the same:Cut the money. Expose the control. Reclaim the sovereignty. America no longer answers to Geneva.We do not negotiate with billionaires in lab coats.We do not pay to be ruled. Trump just drew the line. And this time, the people are behind it. A newly declassified CIA document reveals that the Ark of the Covenant was discovered in 1988 through a secret psychic intel program called Project Sun Streak. Described exactly as in the Bible—gold, wood, six-winged angel—the artifact was buried in the Middle East and guarded by lethal supernatural forces. The CIA confirmed its existence, classified it, and buried the truth for over 30 years. This isn’t myth. It’s the most powerful religious and political cover-up of our time. The truth was never lost — it was classified. BOOM!

Title: CoinDesk Weekly Recap: Stablecoins, Stablecoins, Stablecoins

It was a bad week for crypto prices, with BTC and ETH both falling and the CoinDesk 20, which covers 80% of the market, losing 7% since Monday. But less speculative assets showed plenty of volume. Stablecoins, in particular, were the name of the game this week. The U.S. House introduced a stablecoin bill, following up on the Senate version that was approved by committee last week. Jesse Hamilton reported. Wyoming (aka “The Blockchain State”) wants its own stablecoin and it’s testing the idea on Avalanche, Solana and Ethereum, Kris Sandor reported. World Liberty Financial (WLFI), the financial protocol backed by Donald Trump and his family, confirmed the launch of its stablecoin (USD1) this week. And Don Trump Jr. trumpeted the news at the DC Blockchain Summit. Meanwhile, Fidelity Investment, an early TradFi innovator in crypto, is in the advanced stages of launching its own stablecoin. The venture is part of a strategy to enter the tokenized bond market, Jamie Crawley reported. Meanwhile, Circle, the issuer of the second biggest stablecoin (USDC), has finally secured a license to operate in Japan in partnership with local heavyweight SBI Holdings, Sam Reynolds reported. In news from our Europe team, Ian Allison had a scoop about Sam Altman's World Network holding talks with Visa on linking on-chain card features to a self-custody crypto wallet. Will Canny heard from a source that Sam Hill, Zodia Custody's COO had left and was returning to a role in TradFi. He was able to persuade the Standard Chartered-backed company to confirm the move and we beat the competition with the story. Canny followed up the next day with a story, unreported elsewhere, on the wave of senior staff losses at crypto prime broker FalconX. (BlackRock, by contrast, was adding talent to its digital assets team in the U.S.) We continued to report on Strategy (MicroStrategy), pioneer of the corporate bitcoin treasury. Christine Lee had a two-hour interview with executive chairman Michael Saylor, where he mused about bitcoin as a $200 trillion asset and promised to burn bitcoin in the name of immortality. Strategy has invested about $33 billion in bitcoin so far through various stock offerings, both common and preferred. And James Van Straten explained the differences between the company's fund-raising instruments for bitcoin purchases. Tom Carreras followed up later with a nice piece showing how MSTR stockholders might be at risk from Saylor’s buy-every-bitcoin strategy. Meanwhile, the SEC continued to drop enforcement actions against crypto companies (Immutable was the latest, as Cheyenne Ligon reported). But, strangely, one involving Unicoin stayed open, much to the CEO’s chagrin. It almost felt like a normal sort of week — more incremental than monumental. But then the president’s own media company announced that it was launching its own ETFs and ETPs with Crypto.com. Thankfully, crypto still has the power to surprise. Benjamin Schiller is CoinDesk's managing editor for features and opinion. Previously, he was editor-in-chief at BREAKER Magazine and a staff writer at Fast Company. He holds some ETH, BTC and LINK. Sheldon Reback is CoinDesk editorial's Regional Head of Europe. Before joining the company, he spent 26 years as an editor at Bloomberg News, where he worked on beats as diverse as stock markets and the retail industry as well as covering the dot-com bubble of 2000-2002. He managed the Bloomberg Terminal's main news page and also worked on a global project to produce short, chart-based stories across the newsroom. He previously worked as a journalist for a number of technology magazines in Hong Kong. Sheldon has a degree in industrial chemistry and an MBA. He owns ether and bitcoin below CoinDesk's notifiable limit. About Contact

The 19b-4 form for Grayscale's AVAX ETF follows its registration as a Delaware Trust entity more than two weeks ago. If approved, the AVAX ETF would use Coinbase Custody as its custodian, the 19b-4 shows. The issuer must still file an S-1 registration statement describing the product, however. AVAX, the utility token of Layer-1 blockchain Avalanche, was recently trading at $20.17, down 8% in the past 24 hours, CoinGecko data shows. The altcoin is the 17th largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, according to the data provider. This latest sign that Grayscale could soon file for a spot AVAX ETF comes less than three weeks after investment firm VanEck also registered for an Avalanche (AVAX) ETF in Delaware. Several asset managers already offer Avalanche ETPs, which provide direct access to the AVAX through regulated exchanges. The application forms part of a broader trend of fund issuers jockeying to introduce altcoin ETFs as federal regulators take a softer stance on crypto-based investment products under newly elected President Donal Trump. The spate of applications also comes after the success of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs last year, and as crypto-based exchange-traded products pulled in $44 billion worth of assets in 2024. Grayscale already offers spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs to its clients. It has also applied to launch funds based on less traded cryptocurrencies, such as XRP, Solana and Dogecoin. The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), a conversion from an existing trust, manages nearly $17 billion in assets, the third most among Bitcoin funds behind similar products from BlackRock and Fidelity. The Grayscale Ethereum Trust controls about $2.5 billion in assets. Decrypt reached out to Grayscale for comment on the latest filing.

Title: The Scoop: ChatGPT’s Ghibli-esque images highlight IP risks

Also: Influencer showcase gives creators platform to engage CMOs; return of ‘OG’ Facebook could have major impact on brands. The release of OpenAI’s updated image generation tool has sparked controversy, particularly regarding its ability to replicate the iconic animation style of Studio Ghibli. Shortly after the ChatGPT update on Tuesday, social media users began sharing generated images, ranging from personal photos to violent representations of 9/11, generated in a Ghibli-esque style. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman changed his profile picture on X to a Ghiblified image of himself. While some view the images as a fun social media trend, others have voiced concerns about the ethical implications of AI creating such works. Critics highlighted the issue of intellectual property and the potential for AI to undermine human artists by mimicking distinctive styles. Studio co-founder Hayao Miyazaki has previously expressed disdain for AI, calling it “an insult to life itself” in a documentary, according to The New York Times. This adds to a growing number of creatives – writers, musicians and visual artists – and corporate content creators who’ve condemned AI’s use of unlicensed works to train models. The Times article doesn’t indicate if ChatGPT licensed the artwork to train its LLMs model. In response, OpenAI said their goal was to give users as much creative freedom as possible. “We continue to prevent generations in the style of individual living artists, but we do permit broader studio styles — which people have used to generate and share some truly delightful and inspired original fan creations,” Taya Christianson, a spokesperson for OpenAI, told the Times. Why it matters: The Miyazaki case highlights the critical need for brands to protect their IP – whether it’s photos, videos or written material. Today, AI models, like LLMs, can scoop up almost any content and then turn it into something for others to use unknowingly. While public backlash against this practice is growing, it won’t be enough to shift the balance in favor of creators in a court of law. Brands must take a proactive stance to defend their intellectual property, much like news outlets that have recently taken legal action against AI companies for using their content to train LLMs. For instance, a judge recently allowed The New York Times’ copyright case against OpenAI to proceed. OpenAI argues that replicating content falls under fair use rules, but this legal battle underscores the importance of protecting original work. To safeguard their content, brands should ensure they copyright or trademark their work. This creates a strong legal foundation if someone uses their content without permission. Tracking where and how they create content also helps establish ownership. They should also consider installing access limitations and using encryption to protect content. By adopting proactive strategies, brands can stay ahead of these challenges and be ready if the need for more intense legal recourse arises. As the saying goes: The best defense often starts with a strong offense. Editor’s Top Reads Casey Weldon is a reporter for PR Daily. Follow him on LinkedIn.

Title: A Public Company Boasting Trump's Sons on Advisory Board Is Buying BlackRock Bitcoin ETFs

An investment firm with ties to U.S. President Donald Trump’s sons, Eric and Donald Trump Jr., is putting some of its excess cash into a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) — an unusual twist on the increasingly popular strategy of holding bitcoin as a corporate reserve. Dominari Holdings (DOMH), located in the Trump Tower in New York City, made headlines last month after the Trump brothers joined its 58-year-old board of advisors and became investors. In an earnings report on Friday, it announced that it would adopt a bitcoin reserve strategy and invest a portion of its cash reserves into BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), the largest spot bitcoin ETF on the market. According to the report, Dominari has committed $2 million to buy shares of IBIT as of now. The stock has a market cap of about $70 million and has fallen more than 9% on Friday's trading. Most companies that adopt a bitcoin reserve strategy buy the cryptocurrency outright and self-custody it or use a custodian. Dominari is instead gaining exposure through a regulated exchange-traded fund, a move that may appeal to firms looking for easier compliance and cleaner accounting. The move isn’t surprising, given Donald Trump Jr.’s interest in crypto. The president’s son is involved in many crypto projects and has become an unofficial spokesperson for his father’s enthusiasm. Just earlier this week, World Liberty Financial (WLFI), the financial protocol backed by President Donald Trump and his family, pitched its own stablecoin at a crypto event in Washington.

It’s a highly astute observation, and it is going to reverberate more than observers will be expecting it to. Adding to the geopolitical occupation theme, the U.S. vice president was set to visit Greenland, which Trump is attempting to “purchase” for its strategic potential as a buffer against China and Russia in the Arctic. (All of this should also put Russia’s annexation of Crimea into a different perspective.) In the meantime, in Somalia, where a game of alliances has intensified in recent months, Egypt and Ethiopia continue their battle for influence, with Egypt eyeing a weapons deal for Somalia to go tit for tat with Ethiopia’s MOU with breakaway Somaliland for a port on the Red Sea, potentially leading to a full-on proxy war which will involve other external/proxy actors, all of whom must control these waterways and ports for geopolitical leverage.

Title: CK Hutchison preps telco spin-off – report
URL: https://www.telecomtv.com/content/access-evolution/ck-hutchison-preps-telco-spin-off-report-52697/
Time Published: 2025-03-28T14:04:33Z
Full Content:
Mar 28, 2025 Li Ka-shing’s Hong Kong-based conglomerate CK Hutchison Holdings is making a lot of headlines right now over its plan to sell its ports assets (including those on the Panama Canal) to private equity firm BlackRock, a move that appears to be in jeopardy following reported pressure from China. But it’s also reportedly lining up another major move – the spin-off of its telco businesses into a separate company that would be listed on the London Stock Exchange, according to Reuters. The news agency reports that plans are already in motion and talks are underway with financial advisors to combine the company’s telecom units across Europe and Asia into a separate standalone company that could command a valuation of up to £15bn (€18bn/$19.4bn). The main rump of the company would be CK Hutchison Group Telecom, which comprises three key businesses. The main one is 3 Group Europe, which has operations in Austria, Denmark, Ireland, Italy, Sweden and the UK, where mobile operator Three UK is about to merge with Vodafone UK. Then there is a majority stake (66%) in mobile operator Hutchison Telecommunications Hong Kong Holdings (HTHKH), which offers mobile services in Hong Kong and Macau. The third unit is CKH Innovation Opportunities Development (CKH IOD), which develops customised wireless and data solutions (including private mobile networks and internet of things networks) for enterprise users. In 2024, CK Hutchison Group Telecom generated revenues of almost €10.5bn, up by 3% year on year, and an operating profit of €526m, up by 26%. Approximately 92% of the revenues came from the 3 Group Europe operations. At the end of 2024, 3 Group Europe had 42.8 million customers, with the largest operation in the group being Italy’s Wind Tre with 18.8 million mobile as well as 2.9 million fixed line customers. HTHKH ended last year with almost 5.76 million customers. In addition to CK Hutchison Group Telecom, Li Ka-shing’s telecom assets also include Hutchison Asia Telecom (HAT) Group, which has interests in Indonesia, Vietnam and Sri Lanka. The HAT Group includes the company’s 32.8% stake in Indonesia’s second-largest telco Indosat Ooredoo Hutchison (IOH), which HAT Group jointly controls with the Ooredoo Group following the 2022 merger of Indosat Ooredoo and PT Hutchison 3 Indonesia. IOH has more than 100 million customers and recently reported a 9.1% increase in annual revenues. It is also a major shareholder in Vietnamobile in Vietnam, which is the country’s smallest mobile operator, with a 2% to 3% share of a market of about 100 million users. HAT Group also owns Hutchison Telecommunications Lanka (Hutch Sri Lanka), which is the island state’s third-largest mobile operator with about 3.6 million customers and a market share of around 15%. Li Ka-shing’s company hasn’t confirmed the spin-off plans, but it’ll be interesting to see what is included and what kind of value such a business might attract if CK Hutchison Holdings goes ahead with the plan. - Ray Le Maistre, Editorial Director, TelecomTV Mar 28, 2025 Mar 28, 2025 Mar 27, 2025 Mar 27, 2025 Mar 27, 2025 Sign up to receive TelecomTV's top news and videos, plus exclusive subscriber-only content direct to your inbox.

Title: CEO On Bitcoin: A Big Idea Whose Time Has Finally Come

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Bitcoin is gaining considerable momentum, with the big boss of Bitwise Asset Management having strong faith in the cryptocurrency’s prospects. The time has come for Bitcoin, says Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley, citing the convergence of several forces behind its rising popularity and worth. This is while digital assets still hold the interest of both institutional investors and the public. One of the most significant changes in the financial sector is the increasing interest from large institutions. Horsley pointed out how companies such as BlackRock, which had earlier been critical of Bitcoin, are now significant holders. Bitcoin is a big idea who’s time has come — Hunter Horsley (@HHorsley) March 26, 2025 This reversal on the part of institutional players in the financial space reflects broader recognition of Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class. The fact that these institutional players are now investing large amounts of money reflects long-term belief in the potential of Bitcoin. The introduction of Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds, or ETFs, in the United States has made it simpler for large institutions and regular investors to get into Bitcoin. These ETFs allow people to invest in Bitcoin without the inconvenience of buying and owning the cryptocurrency. This accessibility has paved the way for additional capital to enter the Bitcoin market, which could stabilize prices and bring in a broader spectrum of investors. Surprisingly, some US state governments are considering the possibility of maintaining Bitcoin as part of their reserve funds. According to Horsley, a number of states are looking at bills that would enable them to buy and hold Bitcoin. If the trend gains popularity, it can result in serious Bitcoin purchases from these states, further influencing demand and possibly price. Outside of the US, there is also evidence of growing international demand for Bitcoin. Horsley noted that other nations are even employing the crypto in foreign trade. The Bitwise CEO points out that there has been a dramatic shift in the way individuals perceive Bitcoin. It’s no longer viewed by many as merely a speculative, fringe investment. Rather, it’s more a legitimate investment and a potential hedge against conventional financial systems. This change of sentiment, combined with growing institutional adoption, more accessible investment channels, state-level interest possibilities, and expanding international usage, is a reflection of a mature asset of great potential, said the Bitwise big boss. Nevertheless, as with any investment, don’t forget that the crypto market is volatile. Featured image from Gemini Imagen, chart from TradingView They say journalists never truly clock out.

When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

REUTERS/Enea Lebrun By Rishav Chatterjee March 28 (Reuters) – Hong Kong conglomerate CK Hutchison, led by tycoon Li Ka-shing, will not sign a deal next week to sell its two strategic ports at the Panama Canal to a BlackRock-led group, the South China Morning Post reported on Friday. The deal was expected to be signed on April 2, according to the sale announcement made on March 4.It is understood the situation does not mean the deal has been called off, the South China Morning Post added, citing the source. CK Hutchison and BlackRock did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. Chinese authorities have reacted negatively to plans by the conglomerate, while the deal was hailed by U.S. President Donald Trump who wants to retake control of the strategic waterway. A CK Hutchison unit operates two of the five ports adjacent to the Panama Canal, which manages about 3% of the global sea-borne trade. Panama first awarded the concession to the company in 1998 to run the ports and extended it for another 25 years in 2021. The telecoms-to-retail conglomerate has been caught in China’s crosshairs in the highly politicised deal with a BlackRock consortium, which includes selling assets near the strategically important Panama Canal. The deal is expected to garner the firm more than $19 billion in cash. Pro-Beijing Hong Kong newspaper Ta Kung Pao said in an editorial piece on March 21 that the transaction should to be scrapped as the deal is a “perfect cooperation” with the U.S. strategy to contain China. Bloomberg News, earlier in the week, reported that Chinese authorities had told state-owned firms to hold off on any new deals with businesses linked to tycoon Li and his family.

Title: Banks and Payment Card Companies Form a Discount Cartel to Take Down Cash in “Cash-Addicted” Germany

The cash assassins set their sights on Europe’s biggest economy. If there’s one major European economy that did not get the memo on moving swiftly away from cash to digital payments during the COVID-19 pandemic, it is Germany. Though cash use has declined in recent years, physical notes and coins are still the main payment method. In 2023, 51% of all transactions were still being made with cash, with debit cards in a distant second place at 27%, according to the Deutsche Bundesbank’s annual payments survey. [1] In the same year, Foreign Policy magazine described Germany as “hopelessly addicted” to cash: Germany is not the only country standing athwart the global trend toward cashless payments. In Austria, cash is so popular that the Austrian chancellor has claimed it should amount to a constitutional right. Yet in other European countries, such as the United Kingdom, cash will account for just 6 percent within a decade, and in the Netherlands only 11 percent of transactions were made in cash last year. In other bigger economies, the pace of the decline is even faster. While in China 8 percent of point-of-sale (POS) transactions were made in cash, in India, cash use has declined from 91 percent in 2019 to 27 percent in 2022. But in Germany, an obsession with [NC: as opposed to “concerns about] privacy, mistrust of big-tech and fintech in general [NC: probably warranted], and worries about political and financial crises depleting bank balances overnight—an experience rooted in history as well as a cultural desire for control—all contribute to the country’s love for cash… On average, Germans carry more than 100 euros in their wallets—much more than their counterparts in many other developed nations. Since the euro was introduced, the Bundesbank has issued more cash than any other member in the 27-nation European Union, and according to the Bundesbank report, even though cash use was down from 74 percent in 2017, as high as 69 percent of respondents expressed their intention to continue to pay in cash. Even as Germany has suffered wave after wave of ATM bombings, providing banks with a perfect pretext for closing even more branches and ATMs, and local and federal authorities have made it increasingly difficult to pay in cash for basic services such as public transport or registering a driving license, as the German financial journalist and cash advocate Norbert Häring has documented (in German), most Germans have continued to cling to cash. In a survey conducted by the European Central Bank, 69% of Germans said that cash is either important or very important to them. As Der Spiegel International noted, with a gentle dash of PMC arrogance and derision, in its article last April, “Cash’s Last Stand”, this is particularly true of “older people and people with low incomes and education levels.” Enter the Cash Assassins But the country’s financial institutions, together with payment processors, are now taking matters into their own hands. As Häring reports (in German), big banks are joining forces with large credit card companies in an attempt to force cash out of the market through cartel pricing and unfair competition: The new initiative “Germany pays digitally”… is not an “initiative”, but a cartel. It consists of Commerzbank (Commerz Globalpay), Deutsche Bank, Volks- and Raiffeisenbanken (VR Pay), Mastercard, Visa, Flatpay, Unzer and SumUp. Further cartel members are expressly welcome to join. The aim is to displace their main competitor, cash, and the cash service providers through dumping prices. I can’t judge whether it’s a legal cartel, but it seems legally questionable to me… This is because cash causes costs that are often lower for small merchants than the costs of digital payments, but not zero. Here’s how it will work: the cartel will be offering small merchants and retailers with up to €50,000 in annual turnover free installation of a payment terminal and free use of it for all transactions for up to one year. No fees, no commissions. Those will obviously kick in during the second year. As Häring notes, the cartel members are willing to accept temporary losses in order to incentivise small businesses to accept digital payments instead of cash. The irony is that two of the banks involved in the scheme, Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank, are also directly involved in Deutsche Bundesbank’s recently established National Cash Forum, whose stated mission is “to preserve cash as a cost-effective and widely used means of payment in Germany.” One would be hard-pushed to find a better example of the fox looking after the chicken coop. As Häring notes, the central bank’s cash forum is clearly a facade intended to give the impression that the central bank and commercial lenders are taking measures to protect cash while doing the exact opposite. As for Visa and Mastercard, it should hardly come as a surprise that they are involved in this cartel-like attack on cash. Both are members of the Better Than Cash Alliance (BTCA), a coalition of governments, financial firms, IT companies and philanthro-capitalist foundations that have been pushing back against cash use worldwide, primarily in the Global South, for over a decade. The state sponsors of BTCA include Germany’s federal government. For payment companies like Mastercard and Visa that generate fees from facilitating money transfers between banks accounts, cash is their ultimate rival. In 2010, the then-CEO of Mastercard (and current president of the World Bank), Ajay Banga, openly declared war on cash: “In today’s terms, only 3% of retail spend in India or in China are through electronic payments. The rest is cash. I have declared war on cash; I believe MasterCard will grow by growing against cash. If you keep looking at 3%, everybody’s a rival; if you look at the remaining 97%, everyone’s a partner. Both Mastercard and Visa have played arguably the biggest role in demonising cash over the past decade or so. As Brett Scott documents in his book Cloud Money, the payments industry has “consistently cast card payments as being safer, cleaner and higher status than cash, thereby slowly associating the latter with crime, disease and low status.” The demonisation campaign hit a whole new level when cash became erroneously associated with COVID-19 infections. In early March 2020, a WHO spokesperson said: “We know that money changes hands frequently and can pick up all sorts of bacteria and viruses … when possible it’s a good idea to use contactless payments.” The WHO would later walk back its statement, stressing that it was not advising people to abandon the use of cash. But by then media outlets, payment card companies, fintech start-ups and big-box retailers had seized on the original comments and magnified them, sparking fears over the safety of cash. At the same governments and central banks around the world loosened the limits on contactless card payments. For Mastercard this was nothing new. The company has been stoking the global public’s fear of cash as a vector of bacteria and disease since at least March 2013, when it sponsored an Oxford University “trial” into the germ loads found on the banknotes of a selection of global currencies. Mastercard reserved the exclusive right to present the findings of the trial as well as the results of a highly misleading survey on public perceptions of the health risks of cash, which it did in gaudy glory around the world. “A Roaring Success” In most countries in the so-called collective West, the Global War on Cash has been a roaring success. As shown in the map below, by the the second year of the pandemic cash had already been eclipsed in most of the economies of Northern and North-Western Europe. Granted, it was a different story in other parts of the continent, particularly Central and Southern Europe. It is also true that some countries, including the UK, France, and Spain, have seen a moderate recovery in cash use since the lockdowns of 2020-21. Where in Europe is cash still the most common payment method? In Australia I’m never ever using cash and always experience a culture shock when going back to Germany. Source: https://t.co/wcrj4LkPTL pic.twitter.com/7t8M0Is3Ko — Simon Kuestenmacher (@simongerman600) July 2, 2021 The mass abandonment of cash has been driven by a host of factors such as generational shifts and technological advances, including the rise of e-commerce and seamless contactless payments. Payment card companies, banks and big retailers knew from the get-go that contactless payments would not only offer higher transaction speeds and lower cash handling costs but also encourage compulsive consumption. Now, the payment card companies and banks want to move away from cards to biometric payments. But the notion that this is all part of an organic bottom-up process is swiftly debunked by this example of cartel-like behaviour from German banks and global payment processors. The War on Cash continues to escalate, particularly in countries countries where cash is still King, albeit a rather diminished one, such as Germany, Spain and Austria. Unless access to cash and the ability to use it as a means of payment are protected by law, ideally through constitutional amendments, its future is far from guaranteed, especially with the European Central Bank and the European Commission desperate to accelerate the rollout of the Euro Area’s proposed central bank digital currency, the digital euro. So far, to my knowledge (and I invite readers to correct me), only two EU countries have actually taken that step since the pandemic: Spain, which in 2022 passed a reform of the General Law for the Defence of Consumers and Users that ensures that all businesses have the obligation to accept cash as a means of payment [2]; and Slovakia, which in 2023 introduced a constitutional amendment enshrining the right to pay for the purchase of goods and services in cash. In doing so, it earned itself a stiff rebuke from the European Central Bank. “The ECB respectfully suggests that the provision of the constitution is outside of the competence of a member state whose currency is the euro,” said ECB president Christine Lagarde. The governments and central banks of Sweden and Finland, two of Europe’s most cashless economies, have repeatedly sounded the alarm about the dangers of abandoning cash too quickly, even describing their over-dependence on digital banking as a potential threat to national security. As a recent Guardian article notes, “in the context of today, with war in Europe, unpredictability in the US and the fear of Russian hybrid attacks almost a part of daily life in Sweden, life without cash is not proving the utopia that perhaps it once promised to be.” However, neither Finland nor Sweden, as far as I can tell, have taken legislative action to protect access to cash or its use as a means of payment. In Denmark, by contrast, the use of cash is already protected by law. Businesses there must accept notes or coins between 6 am and 10 pm unless the transaction is online or at an unstaffed outlet such as a self-service petrol station. Norway, which is not an EU member, brought in legislation in October last year that means retailers can be fined or sanctioned if they do not accept cash. The government has also recommended that citizens “keep some cash on hand due to the vulnerabilities of digital payment solutions to cyber-attacks”. This is one of the many paradoxes of the current situation in Europe: even as the continent’s most cashless economies warn about the risks of going too cashless, especially at a time of intensifying IT outages, escalating cyber attacks and other forms of hybrid war, the cash assassins continue to escalate their War on Cash in other more cash-friendly countries — for their own interests, of course. Meanwhile, the ECB is trying to fast track the digital euro into existence even as other central banks express their reservations. In cash-loving Austria, the central bank has taken an unusual step to protect citizens’ access to cash as banks increasingly shutter branches and remove ATMs. The Oesterreichische Nationalbank has decided to install 120 new ATMs in rural communities that it itself will operate. To avoid banks taking advantage of this move by closing down even more ATMs in remote communities, the Association of Municipalities has negotiated an agreement with the banks in which they commit to refraining from dismantling ATMs by the end of 2029. This example goes to show that if central banks and governments really want to protect cash as a public good, there is a way. But it is one that is unlikely to be adopted by the Deutsche Bundesbank or the incoming Merz government, led as it is by a man with intimate ties with Germany’s banking sector and the US investment manager BlackRock. [1] “Measured in terms of turnover, debit card payments accounted for 32% of total expenditure, placing them firmly in first place, followed in second place by cash (26%),” reported the Bundesbank. Compared with the 2021 study, the share of payments settled in cash sank from 58% to 51%. Contrast this with the UK where card transactions in 2023 represented 61 per cent of all payments in the UK, making up almost 86 per cent of the total value of retail transactions. Also worth noting: as the Visa-Mastercard duopoly has increased its market share in recent years, so too have the processing fees they charge merchants, roughly equating to an added £170 million cost per year for UK businesses. [2] At the same time, Spain has one of the lowest limits on cash payments in the EU (1,000 euros). Not strictly on message but, if I give my postal address code (only) to a retailer during a Debit (Mastercard) card transaction, it is not unusual for me to receive an advert from the retailer into my email inbox shortly thereafter. This would only have been possible if Mastercard had shared my personal data with others. Did I give them permission to? Did they pay me for this ‘service’. No. Is this ‘strictly’ legal? Or arguably not? That’s one of the main benefits of cash – transfer is anonymous. Even the Govenor of the Bank of England (in my case), who ‘guarantees’ my payment on the back of tax receipts, doesn’t know about it (and doesn’t get a fee or commission from it). Perhaps the banks should charge a fee for issuing cash, and make cashless transactions free of charge. Paypal offers Mastercard that gives 3% cashback on purchases. Except when it doesn’t. After noticing my purchases at certain large and powerful retailers like Walmart and Chewy ignore instructions to purchase thru Paypal (and thus PayPal Mastercatd) so I can get the 3% and instead charge my bank account 100% directly (so that Walmart gets the full 100% instead of 97%), I transferred my purchases to Sam’s Club Mastercard which offers different but similar cashback. When I contact PayPal asking why they ignore my payment instructions, they at first denied it happened. But one service rep who knew a bit more then most eventually did mention their serive terms allow then do anything they want (not those exact words). The Point? The discounts being offered in Germany will vanish when the credit cards want them to. Presumably when cash is no longer an option. Cash is how I pay my help. As far as I’m concerned, this is a private transaction and none of the government’s business. I suspect this is a common belief, not shared by the fascist government/bank axis, and the reason they are trying to get rid of cash. Anyway, up theirs. Even if they manage to reduce the supply of cash, silver dollars and gold oz’s have always been and will always be cash. I’m stocking up. Not surprised that Germany and Austria are conservative with money and want to use cash as both countries experienced hyperinflation a century ago and memories can be long. You know what people there should do? Start a Use Cash movement. Tell everybody that when the Russians come, they will hit their power centers like they do in the Ukraine so that all those cards will be useless. Cash is vital to national security then and if the government tries to say anything, tell them that is what the government is telling the people all the time – that the Russkies are coming. And then ask the government if they told the truth there or were they just lying. Hoist them on their own picard. I live in San Diego, CA. I do not do business with anyone who does not take cash. “both countries experienced hyperinflation a century ago and memories can be long.” That idea that Germans have been so traumatized by the hyperinflation of the early 1920s that its memory still informs their economic decisions nowadays is very popular outside Germany, but not prevalent in Germany itself. Other countries that experienced hyperinflation at that time were, as you mention, Austria, but also Poland, Russia, and Hungary — this country being actually the historical champion with a second bout of hyperinflation in 1946, exceeding the much-touted Weimar inflation by… 15 orders of magnitude (Weimar inflation divided the value of money by 1000 billions; the post-WWI one in Russia by 50 billions; the Hungarian inflation of 1946 by 400 billions of billions of billions). Do Russia, Hungary, and Poland also have a (comparatively) much higher propensity to use cash? Do those (truly exceptional) events that affected the great-grandparents (or just their grandparents, as in Hungary) of the current young generations constitute a relevant factor after a century? I strongly doubt it. Yeah I had anecdotes about conferences in Germany going back to mid 1990s so Dad, when doing business there, stocked up on cash beforehand (which he needed). The “protection against hyperinflation or just plain overpaying” was big on my Spanish holidays among Germans. German tourists paid cash a lot more and had much higher tendency to buy food at local supermarkets to cook in their apartments rather than eat out. The occasional Spanish business owner (typically a bar owner), when having had one too many, would complain that UK and Irish customers were best whilst Germans the stingiest. Given the known constraints on the budget in Germany I kinda get this. I strongly suspect underground economies are emerging liking cash…..I have seen this at barbers etc but have no concrete evidence. So colour me curious. Older Austrian here, i provide this observation: The younger generations are more likely to also use non-cash, but not by much. In the capital Vienna about half of the population is either not an Austian citizen, not born in Austria, or the 1st generation descendant of those two groups. The majority of those 50% comes from near/far southeast (Balkans, Middle East, Afghanistan/Chechnia). For some as yet not researched reason that part of the population has a substantially greater affinity to use non-cash than indigenous Austrians. This is very easy to observe at any retailer. So the numbers one reads are quite skewed, and i would assume the situation Germany to be similar, maybe a bit less extreme as the proportion if indigenous germans is a bit higher. Perhaps those near/far southeasterners want to feel like they are being modern and they feel like cashless is a modern way to be modern. One wonders if social scientists could do studies to find out if this is a reason or not. German here. Actually, I read Härings article only yesterday, being a regular at his site. Its interesting to get a broader picture from outside on this topic. A couple of observations: – As to myself, I am using digital means regularly only at fuel stations since I noticed that most of the cash I got went there (I have to do a lot of driving for professional reasons). Rarely, when I run out of cash unexpectedly, for grocery. The convenience aspect of cashless is there, obviously. So it’s more a matter of principle to stick to cash for everything else. The reasons are known: practicability (as in small transactions between neighbours e.g.), anonymity and technical safety. In fact we had a nationwide failure of electronic cash only last summer. Didn’t last long, couple of hours, but I guess this made people aware again of the implications of exclusively cashless payment. btw, the self service fuel station in my village doesn’t like my ec card anymore, so I have to use paper money there now anyway. Part of the deterioration of this country. It would be grotesque to force people to use cashless means under these circumstances. – Lots of people are using their smart phone nowadays for payment. It seems even preferable to cards is my impression. Though, ‘no touch’ is an illusion. And the touch displays or typing pads or pencils one still has to use house worse microbiomes than any coin or paper bill. Employees of the federal and provincial governments try repeatedly to get me to receive my monthly payments from them by direct deposit. But I insist they continue using the postal service to provide me with those payments because I don’t trust them. What I tell them is with direct deposit I am stuck with one particular brand of bank and I want freedom of choice to decide which brand to use which assists me to avoid line ups at any given branch. Besides not telling them I don’t trust them, which I don’t, I also don’t tell them I encourage my clients to provide their payments to me by direct deposit. My tenancy agreement states I am not to run a business out of my residence. It is also none of the government’s business that I have undeclared income from my loan business. All for one, one for all, every man for himself. — The Three Stooges Your email address will not be published. Required fields are marked * Comment * Name * Email *

Title: The Six-Figure Nannies and Housekeepers of Palm Beach

Time Published: 2025-03-28T10:00:00Z
Full Content:
This past summer, on a visit to Palm Beach, Florida, I met a nanny named Jovana Capric at a coffee shop at the Breakers, the historic oceanside luxury resort, built in 1926. It was late June, the season when the town’s wealthy residents leave for Nantucket, the Hamptons, or Europe. The used tea sets at the Church Mouse, a local charity shop, had all been picked through; the mansions along Ocean Boulevard were shuttered and dark at night. On the patio, where we sat beneath flower-covered trellises, only a few people lingered, drinking iced coffee in the thick summer air. Capric, who is thirty-three years old, grew up in Port St. Lucie, Florida, about an hour north of Palm Beach. Her career working with children began in high school, while she had a job as a hostess at a Chuck E. Cheese in Boca Raton. “There was someone having his second-birthday party, and the parents just loved how I interacted with their son,” she told me. “And they’re, like, ‘Hey, do you by chance babysit?’ ” The conversation led to a gig as a part-time babysitter for them, and then to work as an assistant teacher at their children’s Montessori school. “Then, when I was a teacher,” she said, “I had families kind of shark me out of working for the school.” The pay was better, fifteen to twenty dollars an hour instead of eleven, so she left, in 2015, to nanny full time for a family with twins and dropped out of Florida Atlantic University, where she had been studying for a degree in psychology. “I could have paid thousands of dollars to get my Montessori certification,” she said, “but for me and in any job that I’ve had, experience trumps anything.” She began deliberately looking to work for more affluent families and found one through a listing on the website care.com. When that contract was up, she said, “I was, like, O.K., I gotta find out how I can find more of these families, and it’s not gonna be through care.com.” Eventually she came across an agency, the Nanny League, that had offices around the country and specialized in placing prospective educated employees with wealthy families. Capric has an associate’s degree, and, to make herself a more attractive candidate, she pursued certifications in subjects such as conscious discipline. “I’m an expert in temper tantrums,” she told me. In 2021, after the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, Capric, who by then was nannying for a well-to-do family in Houston, returned to South Florida. She was following the money: “These people coming from the Northeast are used to paying a lot.” Palm Beach is an island—known locally as “the Island”—connected to the larger and less posh city of West Palm Beach, on the mainland, by a series of bridges. It was first developed as a winter escape for the wealthy, in the late nineteenth century, by the railroad and Standard Oil magnate Henry Flagler, and quickly became an old-money enclave whose pretentiousness was entwined with antisemitism and racism. (From 1939 until 1986, an ordinance required service workers in Palm Beach to register their fingerprints and carry an identification card, which Garry Trudeau once compared in “Doonesbury” to the pass books of apartheid South Africa.) But Palm Beach and West Palm Beach have seen a transformation since 2020. Financial firms, particularly from the Northeast, have migrated to Florida to form what’s now being referred to as “Wall Street South.” Drawn by the state’s low tax rates, lack of pandemic restrictions, conservative politics, and balmy weather, at least a hundred asset-management firms, according to the Palm Beach Business Development Board’s website, have opened offices in the county since 2020, among them Goldman Sachs, BlackRock, and hedge funds such as Ken Griffin’s Citadel, Paul Singer’s Elliott Investment Management, and Steven Cohen’s Point72 Asset Management. Some of the biggest firms share a newly built office building in downtown West Palm Beach, adjacent to a branch of the Wall Street steak house Harry’s. According to one estimate, between 2013 and 2023 two cities in the county, Palm Beach and West Palm Beach, experienced a ninety-three-per-cent increase in the number of millionaire residents, and an estimated sixty-five billionaires now have homes in Palm Beach County. President Trump’s ties to Florida, especially his seventeen-acre oceanfront social club, Mar-a-Lago, have cemented South Florida as a center of financial and political power, and there’s heavy overlap between the list of his boosters and the newcomers to Palm Beach, including Sylvester Stallone, the financier John Paulson, and the technology mogul Larry Ellison. “Palm Beach, Fort Lauderdale, Boca, and Miami—it’s where the big players are,” Capric said. She wore a summery halter dress, and was on a day off from a job she’d had for a year and a half, working as one of two nannies for an affluent family who relocated to Palm Beach in the aftermath of 2020. (Like every household staff member I spoke with, she had signed a nondisclosure agreement, so could not share specific details about her employers.) At the time we met, she was earning a hundred and forty-five thousand dollars a year. She was also getting a housing stipend that covered half her rent, and could expect a year-end bonus. All in all, she told me, her compensation package added up to at least a hundred and sixty thousand dollars a year. She has, at times, outearned her husband, who has a master’s degree in engineering. Capric was working as what is called a rotational nanny, doing shifts of two weeks on and two weeks off, swapping with another nanny, although she said that her workload averaged out to about forty hours a week even with the time off. In very wealthy households, “rota nannies” have become the norm, and the family that Capric was with expected full availability when she was on. “This week, I can tell you how much I worked,” she said, looking at an app on her phone that tracks her hours. “Seventy-six hours.” When school is out in the summers, she might work as many as a hundred hours a week. Though the household was fully staffed, with a chef, a personal assistant, and housekeepers, she told me that she has to be prepared for the unforeseen: to do light cleaning if a housekeeper gets sick, to fly to another state on a moment’s notice. “That’s also why I get paid a lot, because my dedication to this family is my life, pretty much,” Capric said. She and her husband do not have children. “There’s no way I could have my own family and do this job.” After we drank our coffees, we did a lap around the beach club at the Breakers, whose initiation fees for membership reportedly skyrocketed after the pandemic, from three hundred thousand dollars to more than five hundred thousand dollars. (The family Capric worked for were members.) It was a Saturday, and there was no indication at the beach club that Palm Beach was in its down season. The children’s pool was especially busy. At the restaurant, pale men in baseball caps and polo shirts lunched with their tanned wives, their kids dressed in matching terry-cloth outfits. Capric surveyed the scene, quietly pointing out families she knew and observing that they are no longer leaving town as soon as school gets out, as Palm Beach has become the place they live and work, instead of a seasonal getaway. Her employers were among those spending more of the summer in town. “This is the longest we’ve been here,” she said. “Normally, we’re here for like two weeks, and then the rest of the summer we’re gone.” In a time of unprecedented wealth disparities, the American economy appears increasingly oriented toward the needs and desires of the richest, perhaps partly because their ranks have grown. A 2024 study by the research firm Altrata found that the number of Americans with a net worth of thirty million dollars or more swelled by thirteen per cent in 2023, to nearly a hundred and forty-eight thousand people. In recent years, income has grown fastest for the top five per cent of earners even as it has stagnated for the rest. But it’s also likely because these earners spend the most. Another study, by Moody’s Analytics, found that, in 2024, almost half of consumer spending in the United States came from the wealthiest ten per cent of households, or those earning more than two hundred and fifty thousand dollars a year. In cities of concentrated wealth such as Palm Beach, the influence of the richest on the economy takes on almost absurd proportions: on Worth Avenue, there is not only a yacht store but also a store where you can buy antique Japanese naval binoculars for said yacht. What has been called “the new gilded age” has also brought with it a demand for experienced household staff, who, in the face of increased restrictions on immigration, higher professional standards, and a presumption of round-the-clock commitment, are commanding salaries and benefits packages more typical of workers in white-collar professions. When I spoke to representatives at several agencies in South Florida that staff the homes of “ultra-high-net-worth individuals,” as they are known in the industry, the word that I heard most frequently was “discretion.” A nanny, housekeeper, house manager, or personal chef is privy to the intimate lives of their bosses, or “principals,” and these positions’ relatively high compensation comes with an expectation of loyalty. Peter Mahler is the president and founder of Mahler Private Staffing, a firm headquartered in Milwaukee that started serving old-money families of the upper Midwest and now helps place highly trained housekeepers, nannies, butlers, drivers, gardeners, estate managers, and assistants nationwide. The Mahler group also has offices in Beverly Hills, Palm Springs, and, since 2021, Palm Beach. The firm works with around fourteen hundred clients, and maintains a large network of candidates. In exchange for a fee, Mahler Private Staffing, and other agencies like it, will conduct an extensive job search, perform background checks, and help a client put together a compensation offer for a hired candidate in what can be a highly competitive market. They will help a household set up protocols that include cellphone policies, uniform requirements, and which shoes a staff member can wear in the house. When asked, the company will train a new employee on how a client prefers their clothes to be folded and packed before a trip and will sometimes put together a household manual—what British butlers used to call a “drop-dead book”—with detailed information about family allergies, pet routines, or how a client prefers their refrigerator organized. The positions that the firm fills vary widely. A director of estates managing a family’s eight or ten houses might earn three to five hundred thousand dollars a year and oversee dozens of employees and contractors, but even housekeepers, if they possess the right qualifications, can earn more than a hundred thousand dollars a year with benefits, and paid vacation, in certain markets. (By comparison, the median weekly wage of a full-time worker in America adds up to sixty-two thousand dollars a year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.) Mahler, who ran a cleaning service in high school and college and later started a large janitorial company, told me that he learned how to clean from his first client. “She was from the greatest generation of women, who knew that keeping their home was an art form.” He evoked a world of refinement and order, devoid of sweatpants or fast-casual food. As a national provider, Mahler is attuned to where his clients are moving. For the past ten years, Aspen has been one micromarket; Montana has been another; but in recent years few cities in the country have seen as much growth in demand as Palm Beach. He had already been looking to open a Florida office there before the pandemic hit. Afterward, when he resumed the search, he noticed a sudden drop in available commercial real estate. “The competition for space on the island became intense, and that was the first clear indicator that something had changed dramatically,” he said. In the years since, many of the firm’s most significant clients—“people who I would categorize as captains of industry,” he said—have left places like San Francisco, Chicago, and New York to make Palm Beach their primary residence. Several agents observed that the new money in Palm Beach County is notably younger: couples with small children who have fled larger cities to congregate with the like-minded in a pristine place without the irritation of homelessness or, for that matter, encounters with the middle class. With the influx of people, there have been other changes, too: asking rents in Palm Beach County have risen more than fifty per cent for apartments and seventy per cent for single-family homes since May 2019; some private schools now have wait lists. In 2024, the Colony Hotel, a confectionary-pink building off Worth Avenue, paused its customary closure, in late summer—both tourists and locals were still showing up. Once Palm Beach was no longer just a seasonal market, the nature of service there changed, too. “There have always been grand households in Palm Beach that were staffed in the traditional manner with either a majordomo or an estate manager,” Steven Stolman, a fashion designer who owned a chain of eponymous boutiques, including one in Palm Beach, told me. He had lived there for thirty years. Stolman, who now lives part time in California, reminisced about watching the heiress and Broadway producer Terry Allen Kramer serve Thanksgiving stuffing alongside her household staff and wistfully recalled the rules set out in Amy Vanderbilt’s “Complete Book of Etiquette.” “I think that that level of formality is no longer valued or relevant, with the exception of a very few households,” he said. “Now it’s more about fulfilling everyone’s wishes in a very short order.” Wellington, Florida, fifteen miles inland from Palm Beach and home to the National Polo Club, is a mix of sprawling gated communities, golf clubs, and horse farms, and the seasonal gathering place for people who compete in jumping competitions at the Winter Equestrian Festival. “The Bloombergs are here, the Gateses are here,” April Berube, an agent at the Wellington Agency, told me. We met, this past summer, at one of the restaurants of the polo club, where the grounds were closed for the season, and only a couple of people were there, playing tennis on an outside court. The Polo Club is attempting something of a revival, and Berube rhapsodized about the scene the previous winter, when billionaires rubbed shoulders with grooms at the bar, a live band performed at busy brunches, and the fashion label Veronica Beard held a show and luncheon. The club’s director of membership, a former Ford model named Carol Thompson who introduced herself to me as “a grandmother,” came up to say hello. The conversation, as usual, turned to the county’s growth—how bad the traffic is now, how hard it is to get a restaurant reservation even in summer. Thompson said that she had already signed up two hundred and fourteen members to the Polo Club that year. (At thirty-four thousand dollars, its initiation fee is much lower than those of Palm Beach’s Carriage House, the Breakers, or Mar-a-Lago, whose fee Trump hiked in August to a million dollars.) Berube, whose agency placed Capric in her job, had recently been quoted in a CNBC article about the high salaries housekeepers can now earn in Palm Beach. Since then, she said, her agency had been besieged with phone calls from applicants. People have contacted her from Africa, India, and Germany. After one woman was told that she didn’t have the qualifications, her boyfriend came to the office and threatened Berube and her team. The surfeit of interested workers has not alleviated the labor shortage. “We’re begging for housekeepers, but they don’t have the experience, even legals,” Berube told me. On the subject of Trump’s plans to deport millions of undocumented immigrants, the high-end staffing agencies I spoke with remained comfortably aloof, maintaining that they only work with staff who have authorization to work in the United States. “This can sound however it wants to sound,” Berube said of undocumented people trying to get jobs, “but they’re illegally here, they have no experience, I cannot understand them—and I’m trying to be so nice.” Staffing agencies offer services such as vetting work documentation and conducting background checks. Mahler Private Staffing suggests that the clients perform a second background check for added peace of mind. Berube’s staff have become experts in spotting made-up references. They look at social-media feeds. In job interviews, Lisa Miller, senior search executive with Mahler Private Staffing, will test candidates. “One of the joys of what I do is getting them not to be discreet,” Miller said, of the interviewing process. “I ask them questions and see if they share too much.” The agencies know what kind of demeanor their clients are looking for. I spoke with a former butler, Tim Edwards, who worked as a house manager to a well-known socialite in Palm Beach for sixteen years and now owns a staffing and catering business. He told me that he has recruited cater-waiters from the gym, because they have the right look: clean-cut and presentable. Very few of them make the leap to private service. “It has to be one of those people that wants to be in the back row, not the front row,” he said. It also has to be someone who is not easily provoked by a grumpy boss. “All these private homes are basically businesses,” he said. “It’s a business, but the bosses are humans, too, and if they wake up on the wrong side of the bed and you’re serving them coffee, you’re the first one to be the punching bag.” The ideal candidates need to be tech-savvy. (Luxury homes and appliances have become so high-tech that some families even hire a personal I.T. engineer to maintain their wireless networks and cybersecurity, or a director of home technology to monitor smart systems for climate, lighting, and appliances.) Potential candidates have to know not to open the door for the wrong person or post indiscreetly on social media. They must be cheery, but remain unbothered if relegated to the background. “Who wants to hire someone who is low energy or who walks into a household and is negative?” Berube asked. “There’s a lot of people out there like that, but my clients do not want that.” Housekeepers are expected to have specialized skills in caring for fine art, china, rugs, and designer clothes. Chauffeurs might seek out education at the Rolls-Royce White Glove Chauffeur Training Program, where they are taught to brake gently with a technique called a “champagne stop.” All prospective employees need to be hyperaware of their appearance. Berube told me about a private chef she had positioned who needed to be replaced because the family complained that he was sweating too much. Many candidates benefit from not having families of their own, or from having grown children. “One of the reasons I did so well is I was not married and had no kids,” Edwards told me. “If your child is sick and needs to go to a hospital, that’s another choice to be made.” But household staff also see their commitment returned in kind—I spoke with a housekeeper named Claudia Guzman who had left her car behind to help the family she worked with evacuate their home during flooding in Miami Beach last year. The car was ruined by water damage, but, she said, her employers offered to cover whatever insurance didn’t. In Palm Beach, where Mar-a-Lago forms the beating heart of MAGA society life, staff are expected to be either apolitical or allied with their bosses. Donald Trump’s own valet and body man, Walt Nauta, began serving Diet Cokes in the Oval Office as a Navy petty officer during Trump’s first term and was hired by the President for private service after leaving the military, amid rumors of “fraternization.” (When asked last year about this accusation by the Daily Beast, Trump’s spokesperson Steven Cheung described it as “a blatant attempt to smear Nauta for political purposes.”) Nauta, a co-defendant in the Justice Department case that charged Trump with the mishandling of classified documents at Mar-a-Lago, was recently rewarded for his loyalty with an appointment to the board of the United States Naval Academy (the charges were dropped in February after the Department of Justice requested the case be dismissed). “In the nineties, when I started out,” Berube told me, “the big thing was religion.” Now, she said, the agency checks social-media feeds for politically polarizing material. “We’ve got politicians, we have ex-Presidents, we have judges, and they’re asking us these questions.” Although a college degree can help land particular jobs, in many listings higher education is secondary to experience and disposition, including what one Mahler Private Staffing listing called “the Martha factor,” which it defined as “a passion for creating a beautiful, functional, and welcoming home while delivering exceptional service.” Candidates who possess those qualities have found themselves with an increasing amount of negotiating power. I recently spoke with an experienced nanny named Isabel in the middle of a national job hunt. (She asked that I not use her last name.) She is single and childless, and has not dated or had a relationship since finishing her college degree, in interdisciplinary studies with a minor early-childhood education, in 2013. As a “no-screen” nanny, she devotes significant emotional resources to the children in her care—in return, she expects paid vacation, health insurance, and at least a hundred and forty thousand dollars in salary a year. Many high-net-worth families move between multiple homes, and she estimates that at times she has been overseas for eighty per cent of the year, including most holidays, but for her the travel is part of the appeal. “I’ve been to places that I would have never gone on my own or that I never knew existed,” she said. She told me that clients in New York or Boston still seem to offer the highest pay, though Floridians expect the same level of discretion and experience. In South Florida, she continued, “there are some jobs that only pay eighty to one hundred—that’s something I would never take.” Everyone wants to work with a nanny who will teach their children to be in well-mannered conversation with adults instead of glued to an iPad. “The parents want to have the top staff, so they hire the top nannies,” she said. “They’ve been in élite people’s homes, they don’t get starstruck if they see a professional athlete or someone that’s in the White House.” The scrutiny can go both ways. “Working with affluent families can be really tricky,” Capric said. “You, as a professional, have been formally trained on how to communicate with kids, in the sense of learning emotional-regulation strategies.” Some parents, she suggested, don’t have those strategies to teach. “Years ago, my clients used to think they had the upper hand,” Berube told me. Now, she said, an experienced housekeeper might talk to a lawyer before signing a contract. Benefits and paid vacation have become a standard part of an offer. Counter-offers from a candidate’s current employer have become so common that Berube, in advance of putting a candidate on the market, has started checking in with families to make sure that they don’t want to give their housekeeper a raise. The day after meeting with Berube, I visited a housekeeper from Los Angeles named Sandra Bernal, whom Berube had recently placed in a job in Wellington. I met her at her new rental apartment, in Boynton Beach. She had moved in earlier that day and was still waiting for furniture she had ordered to arrive, but the apartment was spotless, with a flat-screen television already hung on the wall. Bernal greeted me in a patterned maxidress, a little white cat nearby. This was Bernal’s second go at life in Palm Beach County. Two years earlier, her employer had sold his house in Brentwood, California, and relocated to Wellington. Bernal had stuck it out for a year, but the job ended up being fewer hours than she wanted and she missed L.A., where she has three adult daughters. When she went back, however, reality set in: the high gas prices, the traffic. She shared an apartment in Redondo Beach with one of her daughters. She got a job in Beverly Hills, a thirty-five-minute drive on paper, but in reality a two-hour commute one way. “I said, No, this is not for me anymore,” she told me. With Berube’s help, it took her only a month to find a new job in Florida. She was glad that she had made the move. Her current two-bedroom apartment is twenty-one hundred dollars a month; in L.A., she said, a place the same size on the West Side would easily cost five thousand dollars a month. Taxes are lower, and except for midsummer she likes the weather. It’s also only a short flight to her native country, El Salvador, which she left for L.A. at fourteen. When she started working as a nanny and housekeeper, in 1989, she was paid in cash, “and it was two hundred dollars a week.” She had always taken pride in the work, and enjoyed it. She had not expected to one day be able to pay her bills by herself. “I’m hoping that this can be my forever job,” she told me of the new position. Later, I spoke with a veteran nanny who had recently retired after a career of more than twenty-five years, many of them in Palm Beach.“I never thought that Florida would pay these salaries,” she said. With her retirement savings, she had bought a home in her native Mexico, and now took on part-time gigs as a newborn specialist. Being a career nanny, she said, had its drawbacks: “All the jets, all the fun, but it’s living someone else’s life, not your own.” Still, she had loved it. “In twenty-six years I worked with more than fifty children. I really put my life out there to take care of children,” she said. “I’m really happy with what I chose.” ♦ An earlier version of this article misstated the population addressed by the Altrata study.

Title: It’s a Powerful Force in American Politics. Your 401(k) Depends On It. It’s Complete Nonsense.

Full Content:
This is part of Trump’s Great American Crypto Scam, a series about the catastrophic collision between the second Trump administration and the wild world of cryptocurrency. Read it all here. If you are a person who reads the news, you are a crypto news consumer, because in this new American moment, the people heading the crypto industry are very powerful and never stop talking. More than that, if you are an index fund investor tracking the whole U.S. stock market, you are now a crypto investor, by way of your fractional holdings of companies that have made crypto essential to their businesses. These things were true long before Donald Trump returned for a second term, put crypto buddies in government posts, and issued a flurry of executive directives for which the crypto industry had long been frothing at the mouth. If you don’t care about crypto and have been trying to ignore it, I’ve got bad news: It’s time to pay attention. If you are like me, you may find all of this utterly impossible. I had no trouble comprehending that some people on the internet had developed a coin inspired by a picture of a Shiba Inu, or that it came to be called Doge, or that Dogecoin1 got popular enough to reach a nominal market capitalization of more than $70 billion. (Now it’s worth a mere $40 billion or so.) It is harder to comprehend that there is now a governmental entity called DOGE2, and that it got its acronym because the richest man in the world still has said token on his mind four years after it first took off. I can grasp that there are unelected racist teenagers looting my government, but not that they are flying under the banner of a shit coin that broke containment. How can something so unserious be so mission-critical to living here in 2025? Just by existing in America’s political and financial systems, we and crypto have taken a substantial interest in each other. Our best hope of surviving the deluge is to master the art of separating the serious crypto things from the unserious ones. Lord knows we’ll have time to practice. Less than 1 in 5 Americans has ever directly owned crypto, let alone used it to buy something. In fact, the rate of crypto users among us has barely budged in three years. The predictions of crypto’s true believers—that it would become a common medium for people to buy and sell things, one that could rival fiat currency—remain fantasy. It feels surreal to type out those facts, though, because crypto’s failure to break through as a payment form has not stopped it from becoming culturally inescapable. Crypto backers seem to have a pathological inability not only to stop talking but to stay off the rest of our screens and airwaves. Crypto interests accounted for nearly half of the corporate money spent on the 2024 federal elections, according to progressive think tank Public Citizen. Only the defending champion, fossil fuels, outflanks crypto in rich people’s spending to influence politics. “It’s like the corporate money Death Star,” one of the researchers behind that report told Slate last fall. Bitcoin3 just passed $100,000 for the first time. This is a bit weird, given that Bitcoin does not represent a share of the future cash flow of anything and has no underlying value aside from our collective confidence that someone else will be there to buy it from us. I find this a bit surreal, but it’s been four years since GameStop, and meme stocks are still chugging along as a class, aided by deepening internet delusion. I wouldn’t put my name on a prediction that all crypto holdings will one day crash. Donald and Melania Trump each launched their own crypto tokens in January, which will serve as useful bribery mechanisms for those who’d like to declare financial fealty to the new president and lift the paper value of his holdings at the same time. Anyone who would like to boost the Trumps’ net worth for the sake of it is welcome to do so. But that’s not everyone who bought $TRUMP. Sophisticated traders made a lot of money in a mad dash to own the coin—more on that in a minute—but plenty of traders were out of their depth and lost their shirts. How many are die-hard Trump supporters? We may never know. Meanwhile, the Trump family made something on the order of $100 million in trading fees alone, according to reporting and analysis by crypto experts and a review by the New York Times. Call it what it is: The president and his family are using regular people as a piggy bank, without any of the altruistic pretense required when Trump or his campaign asks them directly for money. Plenty of market actors will enthusiastically make that deal, and plenty cannot possibly afford it. Many crypto industry types thought Trump’s meme coin4 was a betrayal. How dare he take a speculative currency backed by nothing other than other people’s continuing to buy it, then use it to enrich himself? Our president is neither the first nor last person to make this move. (He didn’t even beat “Hawk Tuah” Girl.) But our nation’s anti-corruption laws, not that they’ve had much sway of late, were never meant to contemplate the most powerful person in the country establishing a crypto token in his name. In January, Trump’s meme coin launch caused some of the most severe crypto whiplash that the American public—and certainly its major news outlets—has ever experienced. Trump and his partners created a billion coins, with 800 million of them in the possession of Trump’s own companies. The price of the coin popped, with some people buying it on Jan. 19 for more than $70. Trump, owning 800 million of those coins, found himself minted a “crypto billionaire” in the pages of Axios. Seventy dollars multiplied by 800 million coins is indeed $56 billion. Trump’s net worth, the outlet reported, had increased several times over. That assessment was technically accurate but fundamentally unsound. $TRUMP was a popular token5 that day, with about $20 billion worth of it changing hands. But 80 percent of the coin was never available to the general public, and it was certain that trading would slow down after the first day or two. There was no reason to believe that Trump’s “$56 billion” stake was liquid. If his companies were to actually off-load hundreds of millions of coins in a classic pulling of the rug on his biggest fans, those coins would have sold for much, much less than $56 billion. A version of this problem exists with all large holdings of any investment, because selling big amounts pushes the price down. But the dynamic is more extreme when the asset at hand just does not trade that frequently. Trump’s holdings in the coin are now nominally worth more like $3 billion, as the price of one $TRUMP has dropped below $15. This inadequate presentation of crypto value is a common theme, as the crypto journalist Molly White has detailed. Some coins that barely trade at all have nominal values of many millions of dollars, because establishing a market capitalization for a niche piece of crypto, hoping that it’ll go to the moon, is hilariously easy. For example, Slate could create 1 million SlateCoins, and I, a Slate contributor, could buy one for $10. Slate’s holding of SlateCoins would suddenly have a market capitalization of $10 million—a tremendous but totally fake windfall for our organization. I am exaggerating about how easy it would be, but only a little bit. The collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX stemmed from a calculation quite like this made-up one. You will get enough whiplash from learning that all the Bitcoin in the world is now worth almost $2 trillion, a figure that is more or less accurate, because lots of people are always (for now, anyway) happy to buy Bitcoin. No need to add to your bewilderment by paying too much attention to fugazis. There is a company that has long gone by the name MicroStrategy. It opened up shop in 1989, and its Wikipedia page still notes that it is “an American development company that provides business intelligence (BI), mobile software, and cloud-based services.” None of that is why anyone talks about MicroStrategy now, though. In 2020 the business decided to start buying a big pile of Bitcoins. It has spent about $29 billion on Bitcoin, and its big ol’ Bitcoin pile is currently worth about $45 billion. It isn’t quite right to say that buying Bitcoin is the only thing MicroStrategy does these days—its software business turned an $82 million profit in the third quarter of 2024—but I don’t think most people really care about MicroStrategy’s software business. That venture shows up only when you scroll way down the page on the company’s earnings reports. MicroStrategy owns Bitcoin now. That is what it does. And for owning $45 billion of Bitcoin, the company has a market capitalization of about $90 billion. It helps to be good at marketing and have a charismatic CEO named Michael Saylor who can get people so excited about crypto that they’ll pay roughly twice the value of a company’s crypto holdings (which are pretty much all its holdings) to own the company’s stock. Maybe you do not have the appetite to buy the stock of a company whose business plan is “We buy Bitcoin.” But you may very well own that stock anyway. MicroStrategy is now 0.1 percent of Vanguard’s big exchange-traded fund that tracks the total stock market. Coinbase and Robinhood Markets, two companies whose businesses hinge on the trading of crypto, are another 0.14 percent. BlackRock, the asset manager that offers a fund that tracks the price of Bitcoin in stock form, is 0.24 percent. These are not huge numbers, but you can take your own guess about whether they will go up or down. You did not plan to stake your 401(k) on artificial intelligence, but now Nvidia alone is more than 5 percent of your portfolio if you own only funds that track the market. Your retirement will have something to do with the performance of crypto even if you own all the nation’s big companies, not crypto. Oh. MicroStrategy just changed its name to Strategy and made its logo look like the Bitcoin logo. The defining value proposition for crypto as a serious currency, from its early days, was that nobody was in charge. It was a truly decentral medium, one beyond the reach of bad actors, be they meddling regulators, authoritarian governments, or an abusive spouse who controls the family bank account. For a while, this was a reasonable point. People had highly personal solutions to hold their Bitcoin. Some kept them in cold storage, on computers or drives disconnected from the internet. Some printed out private keys to access their Bitcoin and stored the paper somewhere safe. (Risky! Don’t lose that paper!) Crypto went from person to person on a blockchain6 rather than through the banking system, and there was nothing resembling a central repository for regular people to put all their Bitcoin. “It’s decentralized, so there’s no country or company that controls it,” Brian Armstrong, the CEO of Coinbase and the industry’s most aggressive spokesperson for crypto, told the Hoover Institution in 2024. “It’s a little bit like gold in that sense. There’s no central authority.” Not exactly. Blockchains are inherently decentralized, but the way regular people use crypto is now extremely centralized. They keep it on exchanges like Coinbase7, which has myriad powers over its users and their crypto. Coinbase decides which tokens are listed for sale on its platform, playing a bit of God over which ones get public exposure. Coinbase lives by the same money-laundering and know-your-customer laws that an actual bank does. Coinbase is the custodian of its customers’ holdings, giving it the ability to freeze funds when it believes it has a legal reason (or, in theory, whenever). Crypto purists have argued these points for years. “Not your keys, not your coins,” they like to say. But these people have lost the war. The functional user experience of crypto is now as centralized as anything in finance. And if you don’t like or trust major crypto exchanges but still want to hold some Bitcoin, good news! You can effectively buy it via an exchange-traded fund offered by BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, with more than $11 trillion under management. You can entertain crypto as part of the world financial system, or you can maintain the pretense that crypto is the countercultural beacon of freedom that its earliest boosters claimed it would be. You cannot do both, but you may be able to buy a lot of TV commercials for a politician who will help you keep up the act. This work is made possible by Slate Plus.

Title: Is Solana Preparing For Rally To $180? SOL’s Social Sentiment Hits Historic Positive Levels

Solana (SOL) is attempting to reclaim a key support level amid the recent market recovery, with bullish sentiment seemingly returning to the Altcoin. Some analysts suggested that its momentum could propel the cryptocurrency to the next crucial resistance. Over the past few days, Solana has seen a bullish recovery from last week’s lows, surging 14% from the $121 support. The market’s recovery has propelled the token above the $145 barrier earlier this week, after printing five consecutive green daily candles. Amid this week’s surge, on-chain analytics platform Santiment highlighted that Solana’s social sentiment has seen a massive surge to historic highs fueled by institutional interest, technological advantages, community support, and influencer engagement. “With news of institutions like GameStop and BlackRock are integrating Bitcoin and launching yield-bearing tokenized treasury funds on Solana, crypto’s #5 market cap asset is seeing an astounding level of bullish sentiment pouring in on social media,” explained Santiment’s Director of Marketing, Brian Quinlivan. Per the post, social media posts reflect optimism for SOL’s price recovery and a bullish outlook on the broader crypto market. Notably, Solana registers a “nearly unheard of positive vs. negative commentary ratio of 18:1 right now.” Just a month ago, the SOL’s sentiment hit its lowest level in a year. According to analyst Miles Deutscher, the sentiment has not been at those levels since Solana reclaimed the $100 barrier in early 2024. It’s worth noting that market sentiment significantly shifted following the collapse of the memecoin frenzy, which fueled SOL’s rally throughout last year. After the TRUMP and MELANIA memecoin launches and the LIBRA token controversy, several community members expressed increasing fatigue from the numerous scams. Subsequently, the cryptocurrency’s price dropped over 50% from its January all-time high (ATH), losing the $200 support zone and hitting a yearly low of $111 earlier this month. Various market watchers noted Solana’s recent performance, underscoring the reclaim of the $136 level on Monday. This level has been a significant resistance for the past two weeks and has also served as a key breakout level during the Q1 and Q4 2024 breakouts. Analyst Jelle considers there’s “a lot of ground to cover” despite the “solid reclaim” of the 2024 range lows. Meanwhile, another market watcher pointed out that Solana broke out an ascending triangle pattern after the price surge. After attempting to reclaim the $140 mark this morning, SOL is currently retesting the recently recovered support, hovering between the $136-$139 price range. A successful breakout confirmation could impulse Solana’s rally toward the next big barrier, at $180. According to Ether Wizz, SOL is “fully ready for its next B I G move.” Once the next crucial resistance is broken, the “next leg up will take us towards $270. Many people are still not ready for this move,” the analyst concluded. As of this writing, Solana trades at $138, a 2% surge in the weekly timeframe.

Title: Panama Port Deal Puts Hong Kong Businesses at a Crossroads

Read The Diplomat, Know The Asia-Pacific Beijing’s public pressure campaign against CK Hutchison portends a growing effort by the CCP to control Hong Kong’s independent business interests. Exchange Square, which houses the offices of Hong Kong Stock Exchange. The ownership of two key ports along the Panama Canal has become a major flashpoint between the United States and China. At the heart of the showdown is the Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison Holdings and its subsidiary, Hutchison Ports. Controlled by Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing, CK Hutchison owns two ports at either end of the Panama Canal. U.S. President Donald Trump has claimed that the canal is “operated by China” and called for the United States to “take back” control. He has even reportedly ordered the U.S. military to explore options to secure “unfettered” access to the canal. To “de-risk” from the geopolitical contention, CK Hutchison reached a $19 billion deal to sell its expansive overseas port businesses to a consortium led by U.S. firm BlackRock in early March. While this deal might make commercial sense for the company, Beijing is reluctant to cede ownership of these ports due to their strategic value and may intervene to stop the deal. According to the Wall Street Journal, China’s top leader, Xi Jinping, was enraged that CK Hutchison didn’t seek Beijing’s approval in advance, and Bloomberg has reported that Chinese regulatory agencies have been instructed to scrutinize the deal for any potential security breaches or antitrust violations. State-run Hong Kong newspaper Ta Kung Pao, commonly regarded as a Beijing mouthpiece, published a series of articles accusing the company of being “profit-seeking and unrighteous,” warning that “dancing with” U.S. politicians would lead to “the condemnation of history.” China’s government amplified that messaging when the Chinese Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office reposted the articles on its own website. This backlash reflects Beijing’s increasingly uneasy relationship with Hong Kong’s business elites. Despite the waves of securitization in recent years, the Chinese party-state still lacks formal channels of influence vis-a-vis Hong Kong businesses, and the port sale has only deepened the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)’s suspicion toward Hong Kong’s capitalist class. While Beijing has long co-opted local businesses to govern Hong Kong – a strategy pioneered by the British colonial government – it has become increasingly distrustful of their autonomy, profit-driven motives, and lack of patriotism. Beijing’s public pressure campaign against CK Hutchison portends a growing effort by the CCP to direct Hong Kong’s independent business interests. Is CK Hutchison part of “China, Inc.”? Due to Hong Kong’s weakening autonomy, some Western commentators increasingly view the city as indistinguishable from China. However, enterprises based in Hong Kong and mainland China still fundamentally differ in their susceptibility to Beijing’s influence. Thus, while a subsidiary of CK Hutchison Holdings has operated the ports in Balboa and Cristóbal since 1997, Trump’s claim that China controls the Panama Canal is misleading. Unlike typical participants in China’s Belt and Road Initiative or other overseas infrastructure projects, CK Hutchison is not a state-owned enterprise (SOE). It is a private company listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, and its institutional makeup is international. Next to the Li Ka-shing family’s 30 percent share, U.S.-based BlackRock (5 percent), the Vanguard group (2.78 percent), and the Norges Bank Investment Management (1.18 percent) are among its main institutional shareholders. Additionally, its board of directors has a notably international profile, with most members having backgrounds in Anglophone countries such as Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom. Operating by standard international corporate practices, CK Hutchison is more transparent and commercially driven than state-run firms that own or operate the other ports in China’s network. The company’s success story reflects a “Hong Kong” – rather than Chinese – ethos, mirroring the city’s rise as an international business hub during the colonial era. Before Li Ka-shing purchased a controlling interest in 1979, Hutchison was one of the oldest and most prominent British-owned merchant houses operating in the colony, specializing in export trade, dockyards, and shipping. Under Li’s leadership, Hutchison expanded its international footprint, becoming the world’s largest independent port operator, acquiring Husky Oil in Canada, and establishing mobile phone operations in Australia, Europe, and the United States. This trajectory contrasts with that of mainland China-based companies and SOEs, whose success is often tied to close cooperation with the CCP leadership and access to state support. CK Hutchison’s position as a Hong Kong-based company insulates it from the established toolkit used by the Chinese party-state to discipline Chinese companies. For instance, the CCP influences Chinese businesses and SOEs through the party committees embedded in each firm. Under Xi Jinping, the role of party committees has been strengthened and institutionalized, with Xi calling for the integration of party leadership in “all aspects of corporate governance.” The party committee chairman now also chairs the board of directors of SOEs, allowing the CCP to take over many aspects of the board’s functions in corporate governance. Importantly, these changes have been implemented not only in wholly or partially state-owned firms, but also in the private sector. These mechanisms allow the CCP to intervene in Chinese enterprises’ decision-making, ensuring that these enterprises align with the party’s political objectives. CK Hutchison’s governance structure does not have a party committee. As a result, Beijing lacks any direct institutional channels to influence CK Hutchison’s decision-making. While Victor Li Tzar-kuoi, the chairman of CK Hutchison and son of Li Ka-shing, has developed ties with the CCP through his position on the National Committee of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, the CCP’s influence over the company remains weakly institutionalized. Recent reports that China’s highest leadership has summoned Victor Li to discuss the port deal underscore the informal nature of Beijing’s pressure. Hong Kong’s de jure autonomy further complicates Beijing’s ability to pressure CK Hutchison. When China assumed sovereignty over Hong Kong in 1997, it promised to let the city operate with “a high degree of autonomy” and maintain its independent judicial system, meaning that Chinese national security laws do not automatically apply. Until recently, the party-state had preferred indirect means to influence Hong Kong politics, including through ad hoc legal interpretations of the Basic Law (Hong Kong’s mini-constitution), political influence via proxies like the Central Government Liaison Office, and the cultivation of strategic partnerships with Hong Kong’s business elites. Following mass protests in 2019, Beijing institutionalized its control over Hong Kong and localized its national security policies within the Hong Kong legal system by introducing legislation such as the 2020 National Security Law (NSL) and Article 23 of the Basic Law in 2024. Still, these new legal instruments are primarily aimed at dismantling Hong Kong’s civil society and political opposition rather than disciplining businesses. The government has repeatedly assured the private sector they can conduct business as usual. Among the NSL cases brought against companies, pro-democracy media outlets and organizations with significant links with prominent activists were the main targets. As Mark L. Clifford, a former board member of a media company targeted by the NSL, remarked, “It’s one thing to go after Jimmy Lai and Apple Daily, but quite another to go after ‘Superman’ KS Li and his companies, the most successful international business H.K. has ever produced.” The Challenge of Disciplining Hong Kong Capitalists Beijing’s calculus in attempting to induce or coerce CK Hutchison to collaborate with its national security agenda involves two countervailing logics. On the one hand, Beijing and Hong Kong leaders want to avoid a heavy-handed approach to restore confidence in the city’s business environment and woo foreign investment and talent. They want to convince the world that businesses will not be coerced into forgoing commercial interests in favor of national security, especially after the passage of the NSL and Article 23. The Hong Kong government has vigorously campaigned to rehabilitate Hong Kong’s image after its brutal crackdown on civil society and to dispel suggestions that Beijing controls the city. While the NSL’s prohibitions against “collusion with foreign forces” could in theory apply to CK Hutchison, pursuing such charges against a major Hong Kong conglomerate would be unprecedented and highly destabilizing. A potential intervention by Chinese regulatory agencies – along the lines suggested by Bloomberg – would further undermine Hong Kong’s legal autonomy and business confidence, as China does not have formal regulatory authorities over this “purely commercial” deal. The desire to portray Hong Kong as “open for business” explains why Chief Executive John Lee equivocated when asked whether the NSL would apply to the port sale. The fact that China’s central propaganda outlets and government offices have avoided directly condemning the deal – relying instead on fanning public opinion on social media – suggests Xi Jinping is still weighing his options. On the other hand, Beijing does not feel confident entrusting crucial maritime assets to a private Hong Kong company. Since assuming power in 2012, Xi has repeatedly expressed his ambition to “construct a strong sea power,” viewing this as vital to realizing his wider “China dream” of national rejuvenation. This entails not only the modernization of the People’s Liberation Army Navy but also heavy investments in China’s maritime industry. The U.S. Trade Representative recently accused Beijing of seeking to cultivate global trade dependence on China through strategic investments in the maritime, logistics, and shipbuilding sectors. While the Chinese government has used SOEs and other proxies in these strategically significant industries to push its maritime strategy, CK Hutchison’s overseas port operation remains a notable exception to the “China, Inc.” approach. According to data collected by MERICS, among the 78 ports with Chinese or Hong Kong ownership or operations, Hutchison operates terminals in 33, outnumbering even China’s SOEs – 26 terminals are operated by China Merchants Group, 19 by COSCO, and 19 by others. The Chinese leadership is rethinking allowing a private Hong Kong company to control such a critical component of its maritime strategy, as well as its broader partnerships with Hong Kong’s business elites. To stabilize China’s indirect rule in Hong Kong and secure Hong Kong’s status as an international financial hub, Beijing has long relied on a ruling coalition formed with local elites, including the business sector. For instance, before the reform of the “patriots only” electoral system in 2021, the functional constituencies (FCs) – elected by members of corporations or registered professional bodies – had constituted half of the seats within Hong Kong’s legislative body. The FCs have served as a reliable counterbalance against democrats in the directly elected geographical constituencies by opposing any attempt to democratize Hong Kong, which they saw as a potential threat to their business interests. However, decades of partnership between Beijing and Hong Kong’s local business elite belie a degree of mutual distrust and suspicion. The Hong Kong capitalists are interested in maintaining close ties with Beijing to exploit economic opportunities in China, but some of them are also wary of China’s more assertive and interventionist approach to the economy. Beijing has been suspicious of Hong Kong businesspeople’s profit-driven motives and “lack of patriotism” as potential obstacles to its political agenda in Hong Kong. The rift between Beijing and Hong Kong business elites became visible in the 2010s. The chief executive election in 2012 was an early indication: within the Election Committee, local tycoons – including Li Ka-shing – backed Henry Tang Ying-yen, the son of a Hong Kong industrialist originating from Shanghai, while Beijing favored Leung Chun-ying, a long-time Beijing loyalist, at the last minute and got him elected. Li in particular has drawn Beijing’s suspicion for “unpatriotic” business decisions and speeches before. Since 2013, Li has gradually moved his assets out of Hong Kong and China, including relocating his flagship company from Hong Kong to the Cayman Islands and selling a major commercial complex in Shanghai in 2016. A state-affiliated Chinese think tank viewed his divestment as a betrayal, accusing him of being “ungrateful” for state support in building Hutchison’s real estate business in China and abandoning the country at the first sign of economic trouble in the 2010s. During the 2014 Umbrella Movement, Chinese state media singled out Li for not making his stance on the protests clear. At the height of the mass protests in September 2019, Li even publicly appealed to the government to show mercy to the young people. Therefore, beyond salvaging the strategic value of CK Hutchison’s port businesses, the CCP has the incentive to make an example of Li to assert its dominance over Hong Kong’s freewheeling capitalists. This is why Beijing’s mouthpieces have appealed to anti-American nationalist sentiments and ramped up the rhetorical pressure on the Li family, even though the actual strategic costs are likely less acute than the frequent invocation of “national security” by propagandists and Hong Kong’s political figures suggests. The mounting political pressure will serve as a warning signal to Hong Kong’s disloyal business elites. What’s Next? Beijing’s vociferous response to the CK Hutchison port sale has already had a chilling effect on Hong Kong’s business elites. While Hutchison’s port holdings represent a distinct strategic value for Beijing’s maritime strategy, as Xi expands the definition of national security, more sectors in Hong Kong may find themselves in a similar situation. Businesses could feel compelled to align with the political goals of the Chinese leadership, limiting their autonomy in pursuing commercial interests. Any intervention by Beijing not only validates Trump’s allegation about the strategic role of Hong Kong businesses to China, but also sets a precedent for further encroachments on Hong Kong’s private sector. Even if Beijing refrains from directly blocking the Panama ports deal, the underlying issue remains: Hong Kong’s business community still operates with a level of autonomy that Beijing increasingly finds unacceptable. Going forward, China will likely seek to reduce such autonomy, focusing on bringing strategic assets held by Hong Kong firms – including overseas ports and beyond – more directly under Beijing’s influence. The question is no longer whether Beijing will act, but how far it is willing to go.

Title: Canary CEO says firm’s unconventional altcoin ETFs are bet on emerging, overlooked tokens

Canary Capital CEO Steven McClurg told CryptoSlate that the firm's goal is to find opportunities before they become a trend. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Canary Capital CEO Steven McClurg said the firm’s recent “out-of-the-box” crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF) filings are a calculated approach to engage with assets that have potential and unmet demand. In a recent interview with CryptoSlate, McClurg explained the rationale behind the company’s filings, ranging from the first Litecoin (LTC) ETF to the first fund to give exposure to a non-fungible token (NFT) collection in the US. He explained: “If you’re a big shop like BlackRock, you can afford to take chances. If you’re a smaller shop like us, we don’t do anything unless we really feel like we can actually get it done. […] We’re pretty conscientious about our time and money, and we want to make sure that everything we’re doing is something that is viable.” On Oct. 16, Canary Capital filed an S-1 form to list the first spot Litecoin ETF, diverging from the trend of filings for spot Solana (SOL) and XRP ETFs by other firms at the time. McClurg explained that the decision came after Canary realized that former US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chairman Gary Gensler named Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Litecoin as non-securities. He added: “Since the SEC had previously approved Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, and we saw a couple of people file for Solana, we decided to look at opportunities that we believed would potentially get approval under the old administration. And we believe that one [Litecoin] had very good odds.” Additionally, McClurg said the firm believed at the time that the LTC token distribution model was unlikely to be classified as a securities offering, strengthening the decision to file for an ETF. On Nov. 12, less than one month after filing the first Litecoin ETF and diverging from the trend, Canary filed the first spot Hedera (HBAR) ETF. Analysts were surprised by the decision since HBAR is not part of the 20 largest cryptocurrencies by market cap. Additionally, Hedera only has $111 million in total value locked (TVL) on the network as of March 27, far lower than major Layer-1 blockchains. McClurg said that Canary filed for the ETF because it identified HBAR as a sound token with demand that had not come under the radar of other ETF issuers. He added that the firm’s goal is to find such opportunities before they become industry trends. In his words: “We want to find the opportunity that exists one year from now, two years from now, because if we are early to the punch, then we will get those flows when everybody else is scrambling to file.” McClurg also said that Canary believed that like LTC, HBAR’s distribution was unlikely to be classified as a security and the filing would “do well” under the former SEC regime. The price of HBAR spiked roughly 470% within a month after the ETF filing, jumping from $0.065 to $0.368 on Dec. 6, 2024, before giving up some of its gains amid the recent market downturn. HBAR was trading at $0.192 as of press time, up nearly 200% since Canary’s filing in November last year. Another of Canary’s moves diverging from major trends was the filing for a spot Axelar (AXL) ETF on March 5. The filing follows a similar thesis of preemptive positioning and has also surprised the crypto market since AXL is not among theough to be included in the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap. McClurg said that Axelar has received little mainstream attention but it is widely integrated into developer environments and protocol infrastructure. He added: “I was at ETHDenver, I was at a couple of other places, and I started talking to protocols. Every one of them is working with Axelar behind the scenes. I do mean every single protocol I talk to is working with Axelar in some way. And I thought that was quite interesting, that’s pretty high praise.” He contrasted Axelar’s behind-the-scenes interoperability functionality with earlier high-visibility projects like Polkadot (DOT), noting that Axelar appears to be executing more effectively in practice. This forward-looking approach extends to the firm’s views on the broader ETF landscape. Canary is also the first issuer to file for a Sui ETF, the 18th-largest crypto by market cap and the 8th-largest blockchain by total value locked in decentralized applications. McClurg criticized a common reactive strategy among ETF issuers, which tends to follow trends already underway. He said that Canary’s model instead focuses on early identification of demand and the development of products in anticipation of shifting investor focus. Canary also filed for an ETF tied to the Pudgy Penguins NFT collection. While McClurg declined to elaborate on that filing, he offered context around the company’s thinking on NFT-based investment products. He emphasized his background in intellectual property investing, ranging from fine art to entertainment rights, and the shift in regulatory stance that opened the door for tokenized digital collectibles. Following public statements from SEC officials indicating that NFTs and memecoins are not to be classified as securities, Canary saw a viable path to introduce NFT-based ETFs. The firm chose Pudgy Penguins over other collections, such as Bored Apes or CryptoPunks, due to its IP expansion beyond digital ownership, including physical merchandise and media content. McClurg stressed that while he has never personally held NFTs, Pudgy Penguins’ structure made it a more viable brand from a liquidity and IP standpoint. “[Pudgy Penguins have] done a better job of developing their brand and IP.” He added that this expansion into retail and animation supports the asset’s inclusion in a regulated investment vehicle.” As the co-founder of asset manager Valkyrie, McClurg worked on the firm’s Bitcoin ETF, which was approved later than expected. He said the experience has made him cautious about the timeline for altcoin ETFs and he is hesitant to make a firm prediction. However, McClurg said he wouldn’t be surprised if up to four single-token altcoin ETFs are approved this year considering the improving regulatory landscape under the SEC’s new leadership. He concluded: “I think a lot of them will probably be approved next year.” Disclaimer: CryptoSlate has received a grant from the Polkadot Foundation to produce content about the Polkadot ecosystem.

BlackRock’s Global Allocation Fund increased its exposure to Bitcoin (BTC) through its spot exchange-traded fund, iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), by roughly 1,810% since the ETF was launched in January 2024. According to a filing submitted to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on March 2, the fund held 821,664 shares of IBIT as of Jan. 31, valued at approximately $47.4 million. Comparatively, it only held 43,000 shares of IBIT at the end of the first quarter of 2024. The latest disclosure also reflects a broader trend of steady accumulation by the Global Allocation Fund. The fund’s exposure is up 91% since the end of the third quarter of 2024 when it reported 430,770 IBIT shares. The position was worth just over $17 million at the time. Meanwhile, the latest share count is roughly 4x higher than the 198,874 shares recorded at the end of the second quarter. The consistent upward trajectory in the fund’s Bitcoin exposure over the past year indicates a sustained interest in increasing its exposure to Bitcoin. The Global Allocation Fund, which manages approximately $15.8 billion in diversified assets across US and international equities, fixed income, money markets, and short-term securities, now allocates 0.25% of its portfolio to IBIT. Despite the small percentage, this marks a substantial rise from the 0.1% portfolio share reported in October. The ate of increase signals a growing willingness by BlackRock to integrate digital assets into traditional fund structures. Additionally, BlackRock incorporated Bitcoin into its $150 billion model portfolio, with a 1% to 2% target allocation to IBIT. The shift also highlights the expanding role of spot Bitcoin ETFs within diversified institutional investment strategies, particularly in the context of multi-asset portfolios managed by global firms. A recent report by River revealed that hedge funds and registered investment advisors have increased their Bitcoin exposure through ETFs by roughly 357% in 2024 to hit a total of $34.3 billion.

European equity markets finished in the red on Thursday as motor stocks were dragged by US president Donald Trump’s decision to slap a 25 per cent import tax on cars. The German Dax was firmly lower as Volkswagen and other car manufacturers lost value. The Cac 40 ended 0.51 per cent lower for the day and the Dax index was down 0.77 per cent. “The trade war has escalated and, unsurprisingly, German carmakers are leading the declines or are among the biggest decliners today. We saw sharp drops in shares of Porsche, Mercedes and other carmakers such as BMW and VW,” Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at City Index said. Dublin US investment giant BlackRock confirmed on Thursday that it was behind the placing more than a 3 per cent stake in AIB on the market during the week, taking advantage of a surge in the share price so far this year. This brought its holding down to 8.48 per cent, according to a stock exchange filing. The bank’s share price rose 1.25 per cent to €6.07 while rival Bank of Ireland was marginally lower on the day at €11.26. Homebuilders Cairn and Glenveagh were down 3.4 per cent and 1.8 per cent respectively as the Government mulls possible changes to the lending rules for developers in a bid to boost investment in construction. Europe European stocks fell, with weakness in shares of Europe’s top carmakers such as Volkswagen down nearly 2 per cent, while BMW lost almost 3 per cent and Mercedes-Benz slid more than 4 per cent. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index was down 0.5 per cent after falling as much as 1.1 per cent to a two-week low. Euro zone bond yields dropped, with Germany’s 2-year yield hitting its lowest since March 5th. Tariffs and their effect on the global economy, as well as their potential to delay Federal Reserve rate cuts, have weighed on stocks in recent weeks, though they have shown signs of stabilising lately. London British equities closed lower on Thursday, with mining stocks leading declines, after US president Donald Trump announced new tariffs on all foreign-made vehicles and auto parts. Late on Wednesday, Trump announced a 25 per cent tariff on imported cars and light trucks starting next week, widening concerns about the global trade war he kicked off upon returning to the White House this year. The FTSE 350 automobiles and parts stocks fell 1.4 per cent to their lowest since early January, with luxury carmaker Aston Martin falling 6.7 per cent to an all-time low. The blue-chip FTSE 100 fell 0.3 per cent, while the midcap FTSE 250 index was down 0.6 per cent. Finance minister Rachel Reeves said Britain was working intensely with Washington to secure an exemption from the US, the second-biggest importer of British-made cars, on auto tariffs and could review subsidies enjoyed by Elon Musk’s Tesla to better support its industry. Anglo American, Glencore, Rio Tinto and Antofagasta were among the top decliners in the FTSE 100, falling between 1.4 per cent and 6 per cent. On the flip side, Next gained 10.5 per cent after raising its profit forecast for the current year, as the clothing retailer’s earnings topped one billion pounds for the first time. New York Wall Street seesawed between marginal gains and losses on Thursday, as investors grappled with president Trump’s latest trade gambit that sent auto stocks into a tailspin, all while digesting a myriad of economic data. In a late-night announcement on Wednesday, Trump unveiled his plan to implement 25 per cent tariffs on imported cars and light trucks effective next week, while those on auto parts are expected to begin from May 3rd. Trump’s mercurial trade policies have injected a dose of uncertainty into markets, as investors fret over potential disruptions to supply chains, hampered investment, and the specter of inflationary pressures threatening global economic growth. “We believe that he’s using (auto tariffs) as a trade negotiation. The markets are jittery because nobody really knows what’s going to happen and what will come out in future,” said Nicolas Lin, chairman and interim chief executive of Aether Holdings. Automakers faced significant pressure, with General Motors plummeting 7.7 per cent and Ford declining 3 per cent. Car-parts manufacturers such as Aptiv and BorgWarner each experienced a 5.5 per cent drop. Tesla defied the trend, rising 4.6 per cent, bolstering the consumer discretionary sector. Analysts highlighted that the electric vehicle maker might remain unscathed by the auto tariffs. - Additional reporting by Reuters Eoin Burke-Kennedy is Economics Correspondent of The Irish Times Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: XRP Moon Time? Ripple’s Garlinghouse Confident Of XRP’s Inclusion To U.S. Stockpile After Landmark Legal Victory

Ripple’s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, anticipates a “wave of XRP ETF approvals” in 2025 and also sees XRP as part of the Donald Trump administration’s proposed digital asset stockpile. Garlinghouse’s optimism came after the favorable resolution of Ripple’s protracted legal brawl with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which concluded with the securities watchdog wrapping up its case against the blockchain firm last week. Several XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs) will go live in the second half of this year, said Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse in a March 19 interview with Bloomberg Crypto. “I have immense confidence in the ETFs,” Garlinghouse posited when asked about his confidence in XRP’s prospects. As of March 20, roughly 10 companies had filed for spot XRP ETF vehicles in the US, including major issuers such as Bitwise, Grayscale, ProShares, and 21Shares, among others. American asset manager Franklin Templeton became the latest to join the XRP ETF race. Despite the increasing XRP ETF filing frenzy, BlackRock — the largest spot Bitcoin ETF issuer — has yet to submit paperwork for its own XRP-based investment vehicle. “I think those will be live in the second half of this year,” Garlinghouse predicted. The Ripple boss noted that XRP exchange-traded products outside the United States are already seeing inflows while other crypto-based ETPs bleed investor cash. “I think that’s because you had this false negative pressure from the SEC, this kind of an exogenous hand holding things down that’s now being released,” he explained. The SEC’s dismissal of its years-long lawsuit against Ripple, ending over four years of legal action against the company for an alleged $1.3 billion unregistered securities offering, sparked a notable market reaction. In the immediate aftermath, the price of XRP surged by double digits to peak at $2.57, according to CoinGecko data. XRP also briefly overtook USDT to become the third-biggest crypto by market cap, behind only Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). Discussing President Donald Trump’s planned crypto stockpile, Garlinghouse dismissed speculation of the exclusion of XRP, voicing confidence in the token’s inclusion: “XRP was named by the President of Truth Social. (He said) there’s gonna be a Bitcoin strategic reserve and a crypto stockpile that will include things like XRP. The CEO of Ripple told Bloomberg’s Sonali Basak that seized digital assets, including XRP, would create a crypto stockpile separate from the strategic Bitcoin reserve. The president’s executive order signed in early March explicitly indicates that the government would not purchase additional assets for the stockpile beyond those obtained through criminal seizures.

Share this article BlackRock’s Global Allocation Fund has increased its holdings in the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) by 91% to 821,664 shares valued at around $47 million as of January 31, according to a Thursday SEC filing. The globally diversified investment strategy, designed to maximize total return while managing risk, added 390,894 IBIT units to its portfolio between November 2024 and January 2025. The fund has steadily expanded its IBIT holdings from 43,000 shares in April 2024 to 198,874 shares in July 2024. Apart from the Global Allocation Fund, BlackRock previously disclosed holding $78 million in IBIT shares across two investment funds—the Strategic Income Opportunities (BSIIX) and the Strategic Global Bond (MAWIX). According to the firm’s most recent disclosure, the BSIIX fund owned 2,140,095 IBIT shares worth approximately $77 million, while the MAWIX fund maintained 40,682 shares valued at about $1.4 million, as of September 30. BlackRock’s Bitcoin Trust has drawn massive investments from hedge funds, pension funds, and institutional investors since its launch. Mubadala Investment, the Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund, reported last month that it had purchased almost $437 million worth of IBIT shares during the first quarter of 2024, representing one of the first significant investments in crypto assets by a major sovereign wealth fund. The State of Wisconsin Investment Board (SWIB) also doubled down on IBIT, revealing a $321 million investment by the end of 2024. As of March 25, BlackRock’s Bitcoin fund had around $49,5 billion in assets under management, according to the fund’s official website.

Title: Has ESG investing lost its shine? Spark finds friends and worries over Synlait’s weak second half – Stock Takes

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. ESG investing has been put on the back foot. Photo / 123rf Environmental, social and governance investing looks to be on the back foot, particularly in the United States after the change of Government. In the US, environmental, social and governance (ESG) investing faces pushback under the presidency of Donald Trump – and there are signs of a change of heart in Europe as well. The term “ESG” has steadily faded from the investor and corporate lexicon over the past year after cultural and political clashes over its meaning and purpose, a report published on the Harvard Law School Forum said. Institutional investors have gone quiet on ESG amid public criticism and congressional subpoenas. Investment giant BlackRock had publicly disavowed the term for having become too politicised and the use of “ESG” in earnings calls had dropped precipitously, the report said. Robbie Urquhart, senior portfolio manager Australian equities at Fisher Funds, said the US and other jurisdictions have seen a shift in their approach to ESG. “In response to that, there are a number of corporates and fund managers globally that have altered their stance on ESG,” Urquhart told Stock Takes. “But from our perspective, we have not changed our approach to ESG investing in response to these changes. “The rationale that underlines that still holds today,” Urquhart says. “When you have fads either by moving the ESG dial more in favour of being stricter or becoming more relaxed, to the extent that you have short-term gyrations in how the pendulum swings, we are unlikely to alter our approach.” From an environmental perspective, changes in attitude towards ESG would not alter the need for the world to decarbonise over time, Urquhart said. “Some of those shifts that we have seen in the US are possibly in response to the parameters being too strict, given the pace of technology changes is taking longer than some would have hoped. “Nevertheless, the world still needs to decarbonise and as a consequence, it is still in investors’ interests to try and help push towards a decarbonised future in a sensible fashion.” Urquhart noted the pushback on ESG, particularly in the US, looked to be strong. Irrespective of how the US may be moving against ESG, Urquhart didn’t think the local “institutional landscape” had altered that much. “I would be surprised to see huge changes in New Zealand investment policy off the back of what we have seen in the US.” But Urquhart said it would be interesting to see how ethical investing evolves in the European market over time, given the likely military build-up there. “Clearly, we have seen a big step up in promises for defence spending in the European countries, and defence generally has not been a great destination for ESG funds.” It’s been a luckless year or two for Spark. A string of earnings downgrades has acted to drive Spark’s share price to 14-year lows, but the telco has found a friend in US investment behemoth BlackRock, which has lifted its stake to 8.07% from 5.9%. And brokers Forsyth Barr have upgraded the stock to “outperform”. “We expect structural, competitive and cyclical headwinds to slowly start to ease through 2025,” Forsyth Barr said in a research note. “While the structural decline in broadband and cloud gross margins is likely to continue for the foreseeable future, pressure on corporate mobile in particular and enterprise IT services should start to abate as [competitor] 2degrees begins to prioritise returns over market share gains, and Spark’s partnership agreements reduce costs and cyclicality in IT services. “Outside of the fundamentals, we believe the dissonance between Spark’s cashflow generation and its ambitions has contributed meaningfully to the 60% drop in the share price over the last year.” The broker said the combination of: (1) maintaining a 25 cents per share (cps) dividend; (2) retaining the A- credit rating; and (3) funding its data centre (DC) ambition was not a feasible proposition. “We struggle to understand why it is taking so long to correct, but expect it to be done within the next 12 months,” Forsyth Barr said. It expected the dividend to be reduced to 18cps. “The uncertainty around funding its DC expansion remains high, but most outcomes should be positive – including abandoning the expansion altogether.” Spark’s shares rebounded off their lows this week. They now trade at around $2.08. Forsyth Barr analysts Paul Koraua and Rohan Koreman-Smit continue to view The Warehouse Group’s performance as unattractive, describing its 2025 first-half result as “less worse than expected”. Of particular concern for Koraua and Koreman-Smit was The Warehouse’s heightened promotional activity and aged inventory, which contributed to a group gross margin contraction of 170 basis points, along with a 7% decline in gross profit versus the prior corresponding period. Koraua and Koreman-Smit did think that costs were well controlled by the group, with personnel and lease expenses broadly flat year on year and IT, SaaS (Software as a Service) and travel expenses down by 7%. The Warehouse has set an internal target to reduce its cost of doing business to below 31% in the near term (it currently sits at 31.3%), but the pair believe this target will be a challenge to meet. This is because sales momentum is likely to remain weak in the near term, there are timing uncertainties around further IT savings due to contractual terms and personnel and lease costs are generally inflationary. The Warehouse has maintained its initial guidance for the second-half result, expecting an operating loss of $14 million, in line with the second-half result in 2024. However, Koraua and Koreman-Smit continue to believe in a downside to the guidance, noting heightened promotional pressure and gross margin exit run-rates in the second quarter of 2025. The pair also expect domestic consumer spending to remain subdued over the next six months. They are forecasting a second-half operating loss of $18m, with no expected dividend until the second half of the next financial year. Shares in The Warehouse now trade at around 90c, having dropped by about 42% over the last 12 months. Synlait Milk’s first-half ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) of $63.1m was meaningfully ahead of what Forsyth Barr senior analyst Matt Montgomerie would have forecast six months ago, but he says the outlook for the second half is unclear. The dairy processor is guiding to net debt of $250m–$300m by the end of 2025 (prior guidance was $200m–$250m). This included the Bright Dairy loan of $130m but excludes lease liabilities of $55m. Synlait is targeting senior leverage to ebitda of 2.5 times in full-year 2025 (which includes lease liabilities but excludes the Bright Dairy loan). “The midpoint of Synlait’s debt guidance and 2.25x gearing (target <2.5x) implies ebitda of $90m,” Montgomerie notes. “This in itself was not confusing, but the lack of commentary around why second-half 2025 performance is expected to be so weak versus 1H25 was.” The outlook for a2 Milk – Synlait’s biggest customer – remained robust. “While favourable foreign exchange and stream returns ($12m year-on-year ebitda benefit in 1H25) may abate, it is still difficult to reconcile the weak implied guidance,” Montgomerie said. Synlait’s shares have fallen, post-result, to around 76c, after last month hitting a high for the year of $1.02.
