Title: China tells state firms to halt deals with Li Ka-shing and his family: Report

East Asia Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing, chairman of CK Hutchison Holdings company, speaks during a press conference to announce the company's annual results in Hong Kong on Mar 16, 2018. (File photo: AP/Kin Cheung) China has instructed state-owned firms to pause new deals with businesses linked to Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing and his family after his plan to sell two ports in Panama to a BlackRock-led consortium, Bloomberg News reported on Thursday (Mar 27). CK Hutchison, the telecoms-to-retail conglomerate owned by Li, has been caught in China's crosshairs in the highly politicised deal with the United States firm. The Hong Kong-based company this month agreed to sell most of its global ports business, including assets near the strategically important Panama Canal, in a deal that would garner the firm more than US$19 billion in cash. The directive was issued to state-owned enterprises last week at the behest of senior officials, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter. Existing tie-ups are not affected. The report added that Chinese regulators are also reviewing what investments the family has in China and abroad in a bid to better understand the breadth of their business dealings. Shares of CK Hutchison Holdings rose 1.2 per cent by noon, down from a gain of as much as 3.6 per cent earlier in the day. Over the past two weeks, pro-Beijing Hong Kong newspaper Ta Kung Pao has published a series of commentaries criticising the deal for harming China's national interests and depicting it as a betrayal of China. China's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office reposted some of the commentaries on its website, which fuelled speculation Beijing could take steps to try to scupper the sale. Chinese regulators, under the instructions of central leadership, have begun looking into the deal, a source has told Reuters, a sign of Beijing's discontent with CK Hutchison's divestment under perceived US pressure. US President Donald Trump has hailed the transaction after previously calling for the Panama Canal to be removed from what he deemed to be Chinese control.

Title: The Racial Content of Advertising

Time Published: 2025-03-27T04:00:00Z
Full Content:
In an advertisement currently running on TV, a young white male kneels on his front lawn, trimming the grass one blade at a time with a nail clipper. Next door, a slightly older black male sits comfortably on his porch, scanning his automated payroll accounts with an air of confidence and superiority as he looks askance at his foolish neighbor. In another ad, a large, middle-aged black woman dances and sings her way through the supermarket aisles, waited upon entirely by whites. At one point, she stands still, looking doubtfully at a middle-aged white male who has taken a break from mopping the floors. In the end, she breezes out of the store, her cart filled by white employees overjoyed to serve her. In yet another ad, two young girls are selling something like Girl Scout cookies — one using a payment app and another relying on cash. The black girl who uses the app has sold her entire wagonload of goods before the other has sold much of anything. At the end, the black girl wheels her wagon off with a baseball glove and ball inside (indicating she is headed out to play), looking back with a knowing smile at her less clued-in white neighbor. These are just a few of the dozens of ads now airing that depict whites in a demeaning manner and blacks as their superiors in intelligence and ability. “Racial superiority” was once regarded as immoral if not criminal, but now it is out in the open, with blacks consistently depicted as more capable than whites. Nearly every medical doctor in the media is depicted as a black male, a throwback to Dr. Huxtable on the Cosby Show. Increasingly, investment advisers and plant managers are depicted as black, despite the fact that in real life, 4.7% of medical doctors are black, while 6.3% of plant managers and 1.9% of investment advisers are black. The advertising world’s depiction of blacks bears no relation to reality; it seems to be driven by sheer ideology. Some will see this discrepancy as excusable and chalk it up to a sort of cultural affirmative action. For decades, whites were depicted in dominant roles. Old movies often portray black women as maids and black men as porters, as in fact many were, but those blacks who were successful in business or the professions, and surely there were many, were rarely shown. So the argument is that now it’s time for whites to be underrepresented. The problem is that when whites were depicted in superior roles, that was a reflection of reality. In 1960, the vast majority of doctors, managers, and other professionals really were white, much more so than today. In 1960, 2.8% of physicians in the U.S. were black. The causes of this low number were complex, more so than pure racial exclusion, but undoubtedly were often the result of unfair practices. Today, the vast majority of professionals are still white, but whites are almost universally depicted as inferior. It is a strange anomaly and not without consequences. No one can object to seeing black actors depicted positively in television ads. But the problem is that today, blacks are almost always depicted as superior to whites, and the percentage of ads that feature blacks in leading roles — the chief of the boardroom, the manager of the office, the factory supervisor, the smart investor, the well-spoken, well-groomed leader paired with a clueless white — is not credible. One consequence is anger on the part of whites. Most reasonable people are willing to judge others of all races on the basis of merit, but the depiction of whites and blacks in today’s advertising does not reflect merit. Whites who have worked hard in school, earned postgraduate degrees, and devoted themselves to their jobs find themselves depicted as innately inferior to blacks. They know that this is not the case, but there is no way to escape the barrage of hateful depictions. This racial inequality must be confusing for blacks as well, for surely they realize how insincere and dishonest the ads are. The ads are a form of racial pandering, and they may represent a desperate effort on the part of corporations to cover their bases: Large investors such as BlackRock and Vanguard control billions of shares of stock, sometimes amounting to 20% or more of a company’s stock. Those investors have reportedly become “woke” to the point of insisting on more positive portrayals of minorities. For those who do not understand the role of index funds in pressuring corporations, the racial content of advertising must be mystifying. But for many, the ads appear as confirmation that blacks have automatically received priority over whites throughout the culture. Non-minority workers who have lived through the years since affirmative action was widely implemented, which is to say, nearly all white and Asian workers, have suffered a lack of opportunity. They have been passed over for promotions, paid less, or outright excluded from employment, while less qualified blacks have been hired and quickly promoted based on their race. Private companies, schools and universities, the media, and the government have played along with this racist program, refusing to acknowledge that it is unfair. Tens of millions of lives have been harmed, but again, few have spoken out because of the fear of being accused of racism. There is racism in our country, but most of it is now directed against whites and Asians. We are expected to sit still and watch what we know to be a lie because radicals in the media and elsewhere believe they are righting the wrongs of the past. One does not right past wrongs by imposing a national program of anti-white and anti-Asian education, employment, and promotion. One does not “change the culture” by airing hundreds of thousands of ads that people know to be false. Blacks on television dressed up in white coats are not really doctors, but neither are blacks who have been passed along through college and medical school based on their race. Now, under President Trump, this form of “shameful discrimination,” as the president has called it, is being eliminated. Federal agencies are closing down DIE programs, and private companies have begun to modify their DIE programs as well to re-introduce “merit.” In the case of J. P. Morgan Chase, DIE has been modified to DOI (diversity, opportunity, inclusion), a step in the right direction. One would hope that individuals of all races will soon experience opportunity based on their performance, not their skin color. As for those annoying ads, I mute the sound or switch to another network so I don’t have to listen to them. Racism, no matter what form it takes or for what purpose, is anathema to the spirit of our country. Only by eliminating racism entirely will we bring about fairness based on merit for all Americans.

BlackRock is looking to add more people to its digital asset team as the industry grows in popularity among Wall Street firms. Since the inauguration of U.S. President Donald Trump, big names in finance have taken several steps to expand their presence in crypto. While BlackRock has long been a pioneer in the space, especially among traditional financial banks, the asset manager seems to have more in store. Four roles on BlackRock’s digital asset team were added to its website on Wednesday, including Director of Digital Assets, Director of Regulatory Affairs, Vice President for Digital Asset and ETF Legal Counsel and Associate for Digital Asset. According to the job description, three of the roles are based in New York and another one in Atlanta. The descriptions have otherwise been kept fairly broad and don’t give away any clues regarding what BlackRock might be looking to work on in the future. For the role of the legal counsel, the company is seeking somebody who can help with future crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF) launches. BlackRock has so far issued two spot ETF products, the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and the iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHE). Other issuers have applied to launch funds for several other crypto assets, including Solana (SOL), XRP, and Litecoin (LTC). BlackRock has not announced any plans to do the same. The asset manager is also strongly focused on tokenization, a sector in which it has quickly become a leading force. The firm’s tokenized money market fund, the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), has drawn in $1.7 billion since its introduction in 2023, making it by far the largest tokenized fund on the market currently.

Title: Bitcoin: Are BTC miners holding for a bigger price jump?

Time Published: 2025-03-27T03:00:31Z

Bitcoin’s miner reserve stability, coupled with institutional interest, signals potential for price growth. Bitcoin [BTC]’s Miner Reserve has remained stable, with no significant selling activity recorded over the past 24 hours. This indicates that miners are holding onto their Bitcoin, signaling confidence in future price movements. Source: X The stability in miner behavior could suggest that miners are waiting for favorable market conditions to sell at higher prices. As a result, this steady behavior in the miner reserve is a key indicator to watch for potential shifts in market dynamics. At press time, Bitcoin was trading at $88,020.88, up 1.53% over the past 24 hours. BTC has recently broken out of a descending trendline and was bouncing off the demand zone. This suggests strong buying interest around these price levels, which could help push Bitcoin higher. The Bollinger Bands indicated that BTC was nearing the lower range of its bands, suggesting that consolidation is in play or a breakout might be imminent. Additionally, the RSI reading of 53.25 showed neutral market sentiment, signaling no overbought or oversold conditions at the moment. Source: TradingView Looking at Bitcoin’s In/Out of the Money chart, the majority of addresses holding BTC are in profit, with 78.28% of addresses “in the money.” This distribution is important because it signals strong support levels beneath the current price. Furthermore, it suggests that the market sentiment is generally bullish, as most holders are in profit. The absence of significant losses in BTC holdings could be a sign that the price has enough upward momentum to avoid a significant pullback. Source: Coinglass At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) stood at 0.501, showing that the market is in a profit zone. A positive NUPL reflects strong market sentiment, with most Bitcoin holders enjoying unrealized gains. Source: CryptoQuant Bitcoin’s whale activity has been noteworthy, highlighted by the recent transfer of 2,760 BTC. Institutional investors, such as BlackRock, are also accumulating substantial amounts of Bitcoin. Earlier this year, BlackRock purchased $42 million worth of BTC, reinforcing the prevailing bullish sentiment. Combined with whale movements, this institutional activity indicates that key players are preparing for potential future price surges. With stable miner reserves, a positive NUPL, and a breakout from a descending trendline, Bitcoin appears positioned for an upward move. Institutional accumulation, including BlackRock’s $42 million Bitcoin purchase, alongside notable whale activity, adds fuel to this potential rally. The coming days will be pivotal in determining whether BTC can sustain its momentum and solidify a stronger bullish trend.

Scheduling Note: There will be no newsletter March 27th. I may be in your inboxes Friday if we get the readout of the March Politburo meeting, and it is interesting. Summary of today’s top items: 1. Reporting Column for Heinous Acts of 'Taiwan Independence' Enforcers and Accomplices Persecuting Taiwan Compatriots - Chen Binhua, spokesperson for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, gave a fiery press conference today. He denounced, as usual, the DPP and Taiwan President Lai, and also announced a new “Reporting Column for Heinous Acts of 'Taiwan Independence' Enforcers and Accomplices Persecuting Taiwan Compatriots 台独’打手、帮凶迫害台湾同胞恶劣行径举报专栏”. You can submit reports to jubao@suremail.cn. 2. Reaction to latest US entity listings - The Ministry of Commerce spokesperson said the “U.S. move is intended to suppress and contain entities from other countries and deprive other countries of their rights to development. It will seriously damage the legitimate rights and interests of relevant entities and undermine the security and stability of global industrial and supply chains. This U.S. move is not conducive to creating an atmosphere for both parties to resolve issues through dialogue and cooperation”. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson said it is “typical hegemonic behavior, seriously violating international law and norms, damaging corporate rights and undermining global industrial and supply chain security”. 3. He Lifeng and USTR head talk - United States Trade Representative Jamieson Greer held an “ introductory” video meeting with Vice Premier He Lifeng. Both readouts make it sound pro-forma, but at least there is a channel for discussion, especially as we are just a week away from Trump’s tariff “liberation day”. 4. Trump dangles Tariff cuts for TikTok deal - In a press conference today he said “TikTok is very popular, very successful, very good. And we're gonna have a form of a deal. But if it's not finished, it's not a big deal; we'll just extend it. I have the right to have the deal and to extend it if I want. We have a lot of interest in TikTok. China is going to have to play a role in that, possibly, in the form of an approval maybe, and I think they'll do that. Maybe I'll give them a little reduction in tariffs or something to get it done.” 5. CK Hutchinson-BlackRock ports deal - According to Bloomberg the two sides expect to sign an agreement next week, even as Beijing-controlled Ta Kung Pao launched another broadside against the deal, and the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council and the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, both central government bodies, again reposted it. It is not at all clear what Beijing or Hong Kong can do to block the deal, but there is still time to find a way. 6. IShowSpeed livestreaming from China - IShowSpeed is a livestreamer with 37 million YouTube followers. He is livestreaming from China this week and he is loving it. The Global Times praised his visit, writing “amid recent "China Travel" fever, more foreign internet influencers are visiting China. Among them, American YouTube sensation Darren "IShowSpeed" is under the spotlight with his ongoing China travel. “What are the odds this IShowSpeed PRC tour is organic and not officially supported in some way? Even if it has no official backing, it is a huge soft power win for the PRC. And if the tour does have official support then the cadres involved deserve promotions. The PRC embassy in the US is a fan: Earlier today I published this week’s episode of Sharp China - Welcoming Foreign Enterprises; Ships are the New Chips; He Weidong and More PLA Rumors; Deep-Sea Cable Cutter. From the show notes: On today's show Andrew and Bill begin with the China Development Forum, including China's messaging to foreign investors, revisiting the Mintz raids as five detained employees are finally released, no updates on a Xi-Trump meeting, and news in the EV space. From there: The US plans to revive shipbuilding capacity, the likely disruption if the US adopts the USTR recommendations to counter Chinese dominance, Michael Froman writes that China has remade the international system, and a few more thoughts on the CK Hutchison deal. At the end: Rumors swirl around He Weidong and others in the PLA, what the noise might signal, and news of a deep-sea cable cutter is accompanied by a reminder that China constructs and protects deep sea cable like no other. You can listen to it here.

Title: Old Bitcoin Whale Transfers $250 Million Worth of Assets After 8 Years

A dormant Bitcoin whale has resurfaced after eight years, transferring huge assets and leading the community to a frenzy. Over the years, ancient whales mostly become active after a major price uptick to maximize gains. These new fund movements can affect other whales, depending on the dominant market sentiment. Data from blockchain analytics firm Arkham Intelligence shows the dormant whale transferred 3,000 BTC worth approximately $250 million. The whale’s stash grew from $3M in 2017 to the present levels. This transfer led to heated debates on the asset’s direction in the coming weeks. “$250M BITCOIN WHALE WAKES UP AFTER 8 YEARS. A Bitcoin Whale that has held BTC since late 2016 has just moved over $250M in BTC last night. His Bitcoin stack went from $3M in early 2017 to over $250M today – and he’s held Bitcoin on one address for over 8 years,” Arkham wrote on X. The move coincided with a 4.7% weekly uptick in Bitcoin’s price. For most holders, the whale might seek to sell assets following the recent price recovery. This month, Bitcoin and the wider crypto market have faced significant headwinds, plunging over 20%. This also sparked a similar reaction from other whales looking to secure previous gains. This year, the market has recorded an outflow of large holders, leading to a price drop from its all-time high above $108k to present levels. Traditionally, whale movements swing the market due to the size of their holdings. Present market forces also led to huge sales from Bitcoin miners plunging reserves. On the flipside, previous dormant whales have added to their holdings or repositioned assets. Recent activities around the leading crypto have triggered a 4% jump in the last seven days. After weeks of negative trading, bulls set their sights on a renewed surge past the $90k mark. According to Arkham, BlackRock accumulated over $100 million worth of Bitcoin without making a sale last week. Most institutional investors have also followed this trend. Furthermore, Michael Saylor’s Strategy bought 6,911 coins last week, surpassing 500,000 BTC in holdings. Most traders remain positive on the upward asset trajectory, citing recent developments from whales. The U.S. regulatory space marking a handful of pro-industry wins heightened bullish confidence in the market.

Title: BlackRock Debuts Bitcoin ETF In Europe Following Blockbuster IBIT Success

BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has launched a new Bitcoin exchange-traded product (ETP) in Europe following the wild success of its US-listed spot Bitcoin ETF, the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). Since its debut, the iShares Bitcoin Trust has accumulated nearly $51 billion in assets under management. The iShares Bitcoin ETP (IBIT) started trading on March 25 on Xetra, and Euronext Paris under the “IBIT” ticker and on Euronext Amsterdam under “BTCN”. “Each ETP security corresponds to a specific amount of Bitcoin,” a prospectus on the iShares website reads. The new Bitcoin product features a temporary waiver of 10 basis points, reducing its fee to 0.15% until the end of this year. This marks BlackRock’s first major step to expand its crypto ETP product range outside the United States after the success of the spot Bitcoin ETF. Manuela Sperandeo, BlackRock’s head of iShares Product for Europe and the Middle East, told Bloomberg: “[This launch] reflects what really could be seen as a tipping point in the industry — the combination of established demand from retail investors with more professionals now really getting into the fold.” America’s leading exchange, Coinbase, will custody the digital assets for BlackRock’s new product in cold storage. Meanwhile, the Bank of New York Mellon will serve as the fund’s administrator. IBIT is currently the biggest spot Bitcoin ETF, holding roughly $50.7 billion in net assets, accounting for about 2.73% of the top crypto’s total supply. When it was rolled out in January last year, it quickly garnered investor attention and began drawing in billions of dollars in investments. While there have been ETPs linked to cryptocurrencies already trading in Europe for several years, the local market is considerably smaller compared to the U.S. — $13.6 billion versus $105 billion assets under management. The largest crypto ETP in Europe is currently managed by CoinShares International Ltd, with $1.3 billion under management and a 0.25% fee. This makes BlackRock’s Europe ETP much cheaper while the waiver is in place.

Title: New SEC Chair Paul Atkins Holds $6,000,000 in Crypto-Related Investments – Here’s His Portfolio: Report

The new Chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reportedly has a crypto portfolio worth millions of dollars. According to a new report from Fortune, an ethics disclosure reveals that Paul Atkins – President Donald Trump’s nominee to be the next SEC Chair – holds about $6 million in crypto-related investments, including $1 million worth of equity in two crypto firms and $5 million in crypto investment funds. Atkins, who previously served as the SEC’s Chair between 2002 and 2008 under then-President George W. Bush, held a board seat on Securitize – a tokenization firm backed by asset management giant BlackRock – and owned between $250,000 and $500,000 worth of call options in the company, according to the report. He also held between $250,000 and $500,000 in equity in crypto bank Anchorage Digital and between $1 million and $5 million worth of staked crypto on Off the Chain Capital, an investment fund of which he is a limited partner. In the ethics agreement, Atkins agreed to divest his holdings after his confirmation, which is slated for Thursday. According to Bloomberg, Atkins and his spouse have a net worth of at least $327 million. Under the helm of its previous Chair, Gary Gensler, the SEC waged war on the digital assets industry by accusing several high-profile crypto firms, including Ripple Labs, Binance, Coinbase, and Consensys, of violating securities laws. Gensler also deemed many crypto assets, including smart contract platforms Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL), as securities that fell under the agency’s regulatory jurisdiction.

Title: Looking for a job in a recession? Here's the advice this career coach gives her clients.

Recession fears, DOGE cuts, broad layoffs — It's a tough time to be looking for a job. But it's definitely not impossible, and there are certain steps you can take to make sure your next job is more resilient to volatile economic conditions, according to career coach Marnie Lemonik. Big companies like Meta and Blackrock have announced plans to cut down their workforce numbers this year. Unemployment has ticked up slightly from 3.9% a year ago to 4.1% now. And while DOGE layoffs didn't lead to a spike in unemployment claims in February, they could start showing up in next month's data, according to Shruti Mishra, an economist at Bank of America. Uncertainty around DOGE and tariffs could also lead some employers to pause hiring, Mishra added. The choppy economic environment doesn't paint a rosy picture for those who are looking for a new job. However, it hasn't deterred some people — namely, Gen Z workers. In fact, the prevalence of layoffs might further incentivize some workers to start recruiting. "The sentiment that I'm hearing from clients is 'I don't really feel a lot of stability,' and so that loyalty to a company for any given amount of time or reason is just less relevant because no one feels like they're getting that loyalty from the employer side," Lemonik said. Here's the advice Lemonik gives her clients who are looking for jobs right now. Lemonik's clients are exercising more caution in today's job market than they did in previous years. Last year, it wasn't uncommon for Lemonik to see burnt-out clients quit their jobs with nothing lined up. "Even a year ago, I felt like I was working with more people that were like, 'I'm really burned out at my job, and if I don't have another job in 3 months, I think I'm still going to take a break,'" Lemonik said. Now, she's seeing more hesitation from her clients. "It's less so that people are gripping to the job that they have, but more so that they're not willing to take that risk of leaving without another job," Lemonik added. One of the most common questions Lemonik's clients ask her when they interview for jobs is how they can determine if the job is safe from layoffs. The biggest takeaway that Lemonik shared? You can't definitively predict if a job is "stable" or "safe." "I think we all have to have some stability within ourselves in the way that we build our own career paths and financial safety nets because you can't put your stability or safety in any employer. This is my honest take that I give people," Lemonik told BI. That's why it can be helpful to build up an emergency fund and evaluate your current budget to see where you can cut back on spending. Upskilling and investing in your career can also be ways to negotiate your salary at your next job and preserve job security in an economic downturn. Lemonik tells her clients to take advantage of the opportunity to do their due diligence on a job when hiring managers ask, "Do you have any questions for me?" "Could this be a department that's cut? Is this a smart type of role to be getting? Are these the first people out when there's no more budget left? These are the things people are trying to figure out," Lemonik said. Asking the interviewer certain questions at the end of the interview can give you insights into how insulated the role is from economic volatility. Lemonik recommends asking about the direction of the company, as well as situational questions about how the company has dealt with challenges in the past. She provided the following examples: These questions allow you to examine if the role you're interviewing for has long-term growth potential. They also highlight what to expect from company leadership. "I think anything you can do to explore how the leaders of the company operate when things are not as certain is a good indicator of how the company is going to react to potentially inevitable changes," Lemonik said.

Title: Fidelity confirms stablecoin testing but no plans to launch yet

The asset manager recently filed for a tokenized fund, following other traditional finance giants such as BlackRock and Franklin Templeton. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Fidelity is reportedly in advanced testing phases of its own stablecoin as part of its digital asset expansion, the Financial Times reported on March 26. However, a company spokesperson told Reuters that the firm does not have plans to launch the stablecoin in the near term. Earlier this month, a Fidelity unit filed to launch a tokenized money market fund. Under the proposal, investor shares would be recorded on the blockchain via conventional electronic recordkeeping systems, signaling the firm’s continued interest in exploring blockchain applications within existing financial products. Fidelity’s potential move comes amid a wave of institutional interest in stablecoins, driven by clearer regulatory signals and growing adoption in the US under President Donald Trump’s administration. The stablecoin sector currently commands a $231 billion market cap and processed $27.6 trillion in transfer volume last year, outpacing both Visa and Mastercard. Interest in stablecoins is rising rapidly since they offer fast, borderless, and cost-efficient settlement that outperforms traditional financial infrastructure. Institutions see stablecoins as a more efficient alternative to legacy systems. The surge in adoption comes as regulatory clarity begins to take shape, with bipartisan legislation in the US paving the way for compliant issuance. At the same time, stablecoins are gaining geopolitical relevance, as dollar-pegged tokens are viewed as a way to reinforce the US dollar’s dominance in a global economy facing competition from CBDCs and rival currencies. Beyond stablecoins, the broader trend of tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs) continues to gain momentum. On March 25, the market for tokenized U.S. Treasuries surpassed $5 billion, with over half of that value managed by traditional finance heavyweights like BlackRock and Franklin Templeton. Given Fidelity’s scale — managing $5.9 trillion in assets as the world’s third-largest asset manager — its growing interest in the space reflects a broader institutional shift. The regulatory environment for stablecoins is also rapidly evolving. On March 13, the Senate Banking Committee passed the bipartisan GENIUS Act in an 18-6 vote. Introduced by Senator Bill Hagerty, the legislation seeks to establish clear rules for the issuance and oversight of stablecoins in the US. One key provision would require U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins to maintain full 1:1 reserves in cash, insured bank deposits, or short-term Treasury bills. Bo Hines, Executive Director of the Presidential Working Group on Digital Assets Markets, stated on March 18 that a regulatory framework for stablecoins could be approved by Trump within two months.

Title: XRP ETF Mania: Pundit Predicts BlackRock And Fidelity Will Soon Jump Into The Ring Amid Ripple’s Victory

With the Securities and Exchange Commission finally pulling the plug on a four-year court battle with Ripple, the chances of a spot XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) being greenlighted in the U.S. have certainly increased. A top analyst has predicted that Wall Street giants BlackRock and Fidelity will soon enter the XRP ETF race. On Wednesday, Ripple agreed to pay a $50 million fine to end the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s years-long enforcement case concerning the XRP cryptocurrency. The SEC sued Ripple in late 2020, accusing it of raising $1.3 billion through an unregistered securities offering of XRP. As ZyCrypto reported, Ripple’s CLO, Stuart Alderoty, said that the company had meanwhile agreed to drop its cross-appeal of U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres’ ruling, which found that XRP is “not necessarily a security on its face,” especially within the context of programmatic sales to retail customers. Alderoty’s announcement follows Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse’s declaration that the SEC’s case has ended. He described it as a “long overdue surrender” on the financial regulator’s part last week. The SEC’s about-face was widely anticipated following Trump’s return to the White House. Since Acting SEC Chair Mark Uyeda took over the commission’s reins, it has retreated from several lawsuits, including those against Robinhood, Coinbase, and OpenSea. The SEC’s retreat opens the door for mainstream institutional access to XRP, potentially transforming a once-embattled crypto into an approved financial product alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Nate Geraci, president of the ETF Store, is now convinced that the regulator’s approval of spot XRP ETFs is only “a matter of time.” At least seven major investment firms, including Bitwise, 21Shares, Grayscale, WisdomTree, and Franklin Templeton, have filed for XRP-focused ETFs in anticipation of regulatory greenlight. But despite the growing XRP ETF filing craze, BlackRock — issuer of the largest spot Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) — has yet to submit a filing for an XRP-based product. But the top ETF analyst sees this changing soon. “And yes, I expect BlackRock, Fidelity, etc, to all be involved. XRP currently the 3rd largest non-stablecoin crypto asset by market cap. Largest ETF issuers aren’t going to ignore this,” Geraci added. XRP was valued at $2.40 as of press time after shedding 1.6% over the last 24 hours.

Title: Banks' Spot Crypto Holdings Continue to Collapse as Firms Move to ETPs

Banks across the globe held a total of 341.5 billion euros ($368.3 billion) in crypto assets under custody in the second quarter of 2024 but spot crypto assets now make up less than 3% of banks' holdings — down significantly from a few years ago, data by standard setter Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) showed on Wednesday. BCBS, which focuses on setting measures to ensure the stability of banks, gathered voluntary and confidential submissions from 176 banks — of which 115 are internationally active — in June 2024. The data showed that just 29 banks contributed to the 341.5 billion euro figure, and the vast majority hold exchange-traded products tracking crypto over cryptocurrencies. Global watchdogs have been keeping a close eye on how interlinked the financial sector is with crypto following the collapse of crypto-friendly banks like Signature Bank and Silicon Valley Banks in 2023. The BCBS also recommended that banks' spot crypto exposure should not exceed 2% in December 2022. Banks appear to be following through on this; their exposure to spot crypto holdings fell 44% between 2021 to 2022. As of the June 2024 survey, banks held almost no spot crypto, at 2.46%, instead preferring exchange-traded products. About 92.5% of banks' holdings are now in these more regulated products tracking crypto prices, rather than crypto assets themselves, the BCBS survey showed.

Title: Mother Revamps Global Leadership Ahead of 30th Anniversary

We deliver! Get curated industry news straight to your inbox. Subscribe to Adweek newsletters. Mother has overhauled its global leadership team ahead of its 30th anniversary. Felix Richter, previously chief creative officer of Mother London, has been named global chief creative officer. Teri Miller takes on the dual roles of U.S. chief executive officer and global chief client officer. Katie Mackay-Sinclair, who was a partner at Mother London, assumes the role of global chief brand officer, and Chris Gallery, also a former partner at Mother London, has been appointed global chief strategy officer. The four will continue their existing responsibilities—Richter leading Mother London’s creative output, Miller overseeing U.S. operations, and Mackay-Sinclair and Gallery shaping strategy and brand vision—while joining global CEO Michael Wall and founder Robert Saville in leading Mother’s creative and strategic direction across offices in London, New York, Los Angeles, Berlin and Shanghai. “This is a world-class team, and they are proven and high-quality practitioners for Mother,” Wall said in a statement. Richter, who joined Mother London in 2022 as CCO and global creative partner after more than a decade at Droga5, has led the agency to major accolades, including ADWEEK’s International Agency of the Year in 2024. Under his leadership, the agency has produced acclaimed work for Uber, KFC, and IKEA. His new post marks the first time in Mother’s history that the agency has had a global creative lead. In the role, he will collaborate with the CCOs across Mother’s offices while continuing to oversee London’s creative output. Richter noted that the creation of a global CCO role formalizes a natural shift toward increased global collaboration across Mother’s offices in London, New York, Los Angeles, Berlin, and Shanghai over the past few years. “We are finding that our most exciting new business wins, and the most exciting work that comes out, are often the results of collaboration between offices of all different shapes and sizes,” Richter told ADWEEK. Miller, meanwhile, will take the helm on leading Mother’s expansion in North America after Mother U.S. CEO Peter Ravailhe announced his departure last week. Since joining in 2022 from 72andSunny, where she served as president, Miller has played a key role in securing major clients for Mother including Electronic Arts, General Motors, BlackRock and General Mills. Mackay-Sinclair and Gallery, both longtime strategists at Mother, will shape the agency’s global brand and strategic vision. Both have been instrumental in Mother London’s success, including leading work that earned a UK Effie Grand Prix for IKEA’s sustained success. The leadership restructuring comes as Mother continues to expand its client portfolio. Recent wins include General Motors adding Mother LA to its roster, Sonic retaining Mother as its lead creative agency, and Seventh Generation naming Mother New York its agency of record. The agency has also picked up assignments for Duolingo and General Mills. Mother US CEO Peter Ravailhe Leaves for Luxury Consultancy As independent agencies gain momentum as an alternative to holding companies, Mother sees an opportunity to double down on its positioning as a global independent. “It feels like the time is ours,” Mackay-Sinclair told ADWEEK. “When we look at the context of our industry, there are mergers, there’s collapsing of big, established creative brands.” In Mackay-Sinclair’s telling, it’s the agency’s longevity that sets it apart: “There might be a lot of indies out there, but you’re not really an indie unless you’ve been doing it for the long haul… We are lucky to be sitting here thinking, ‘What do the next 30 years of Mother look like?’” Audrey Kemp is a staff reporter for Adweek based in New York City.

Title: Solana Gets A $1.7 Billion Boost As BlackRock Expands Tokenized Funds

Financial management behemoth BlackRock has made another move in its approach to blockchain by starting a fund for big clients on the Solana network. Reports from Fortune say that this fund, called the USD Institutional Digital Fund (BUIDL), is now available on seven different blockchain platforms. BlackRock, which manages $11.6 trillion in assets, has been slowly entering the world of cryptocurrency and blockchain. Since its start in March 2024, BUIDL has already gathered $1.7 billion in assets. Experts believe the fund could reach $2 billion by April. Solana is attractive because it carries out transactions fast and charges low fees. This blockchain gives investors constant access to regular financial tools. Michael Sonnenshein, the COO of Securitize, says this way of doing things makes it easier and more convenient for funds like treasuries. The institutions are here. Today @Securitize launched the largest yield-bearing tokenized treasury fund ($1.7B), BUIDL, on Solana. BUIDL is issued by BlackRock — the world’s largest asset manager. More from Fortune:https://t.co/pFRrr341Kv — Solana (@solana) March 25, 2025 BlackRock brought its Bitcoin ETP to Europe on Tuesday. It announced that it would start on Xetra and in Euronext Paris and Amsterdam. Franklin Templeton also entered the blockchain scene by launching a money fund on Solana in February. This shows that more major financial groups are interested in using blockchain for investment products. In addition to running funds on blockchain, BlackRock has set up Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US, Canada, and Europe. CEO Larry Fink believes blockchain will be important in future financial tools. The company appears to have shifted its focus to asset tokenization after the breakthrough. Moving traditional investment vehicles to the blockchain is the next big thing, Fink said. BUIDL is now a part of blockchain networks like Ethereum, Optimism, Aptos, Avalanche, Arbitrum, and Polygon. The fund, backed by cash and Treasury bills, offers big investors a new way to invest using regular financial methods. BlackRock’s effort to merge blockchain with everyday financial products is clear with $1.7 billion already invested, showing strong interest from investors in these new financial tools. Choosing Solana shows the growing confidence in this blockchain’s ability to manage many transactions fast and at a low cost. This makes it a suitable option for big financial firms seeking innovative investment methods.

Title: Ripple-SEC dispute resolution sparks hope for a BlackRock XRP ETF application

Polymarket predicts high chances of XRP ETF approval amid Ripple's SEC settlement. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Optimism around a potential spot XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) is rising as Ripple edges closer to the end of its long-standing legal clash with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). On March 26, Nate Geraci, President of the ETF Store, sparked fresh discussion around the possibility of an XRP ETF. He suggested that regulatory approval might be closer than expected, especially with Ripple’s courtroom challenges nearing resolution. Geraci expressed confidence that once the path clears, heavyweight asset managers such as BlackRock and Fidelity could offer XRP-based investment products. BlackRock and Fidelity are the world’s leading asset management firms, managing more than $15 trillion in assets cumulatively. The two firms have significant exposure to the crypto industry, with their Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs dominating the market. Geraci’s optimism is rooted in XRP’s strong market presence. Currently, it ranks as the third-largest non-stablecoin crypto by market capitalization—a position likely to draw institutional interest. According to him: “XRP currently 3rd largest non-stablecoin crypto asset by market cap. Largest ETF issuers aren’t going to ignore this.” Market sentiment supports this outlook. Crypto bettors on the decentralized betting marketplace Polymarket have placed heavy bets on an XRP ETF approval, assigning it an 86% probability of getting SEC clearance by the end of 2025. The recent rise in confidence follows key developments in Ripple’s legal battle with the financial regulator. Last week, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse announced that the SEC had withdrawn its appeal, marking a turning point in the multi-year legal standoff. On March 25, Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty confirmed that the company would pay a $50 million fine and drop its cross-appeal against the regulator. A key component of the proposed resolution includes lifting a court order that previously barred Ripple from selling XRP to institutional investors. However, this action still awaits SEC Commissioner approval and a green light from the court. Despite concerns over tighter regulatory oversight, Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer David Schwartz clarified that the settlement does not alter the company’s core legal position. According to him, Ripple will continue operating under its current framework, with the lifting of the injunction being only one of several developments likely to take shape under the SEC’s new leadership.

Title: BlackRock BUIDL expands into Solana – Is this what SOL needs to beat ETH?

Is BlackRock’s move to Solana a signal that Ethereum is losing ground? BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, is strengthening its foothold in the crypto sector by expanding its blockchain-based money market fund to Solana [SOL]. In collaboration with its technology partner Securitize, BlackRock has introduced a new share class of the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Fund (BUIDL) on SOL’s network. This move comes a year after the fund’s initial launch and highlights BlackRock’s continued push into tokenized finance. By integrating BUIDL into Solana’s ecosystem, investors can now leverage the network’s low transaction costs and instant settlement capabilities. Remarking on the same, Carlos Domingo, Co-founder and CEO of Securitize, said, “As the market for RWAs and tokenized treasuries gains momentum, expanding BUIDL to Solana—a blockchain known for its speed, scalability, and cost efficiency—is a natural next step.” Adding to the fray was Lily Liu, President of the Solana Foundation, who noted, “Solana is uniquely positioned to drive the next wave of adoption for tokenized real-world assets due to the network’s speed, low costs and active developer ecosystem. Blackrock’s expansion of BUIDL on Solana offers users a network that balances innovation with the operational efficiency the industry demands.” BlackRock’s expansion of its BUIDL fund to Solana comes amid a significant increase in its Ethereum [ETH] holdings, which have surged to a record $1.145 billion. In fact, Kyle Samani, co-founder and managing partner of Multicoin Capital, recently reinforced his bullish outlook on SOL in an interview with Frank Chaparro. On the other hand, Samani also raised critical concerns about ETH’s roll-up-centric scaling approach, questioning its long-term viability. His remarks reflect the ongoing debate between Solana and Ethereum among industry leaders and who is going to outpace the other. That being said, Solana’s dominance over Ethereum remains evident across key metrics such as DEX trading volume, user activity, and transaction fees. While its fee advantage briefly narrowed in February, Solana has consistently maintained a multi-million-dollar lead since early January. Seeing this, analysts at Delphi Digital predict that this trend could extend into 2025, positioning SOL as the top Layer 1 blockchain. Additionally, on the price front, SOL continues to outperform, recently rising 3.83% to $144.51, while ETH saw a modest 0.87% increase to $2,069.30. Therefore, with strong momentum and sustained growth, Solana’s competitive edge over Ethereum appears poised to strengthen further.

Title: ‘Critically Important’: Iran Allegedly Used China as Golden Ticket to Quietly Operate in Panama Canal

DAILY CALLER NEWS FOUNDATION—China’s growing foothold over the Panama Canal isn’t just fueling its own commercial interests, it also appears to be helping America’s adversaries engage side-step sanctions, court documents obtained by the Daily Caller News Foundation show. China has expanded its presence considerably in the Panama Canal since former President Jimmy Carter sold the shipping lane to Panama for $1 in 1977, and is funding multibillion-dollar infrastructure projects in the surrounding countryside while buying up ports to solidify its foothold. It’s also been a boon to American adversaries, like Iran. Panamanian court documents obtained by the Daily Caller News Foundation show how Iran appeared to have used proxy firms based in Hong Kong to register ships in the Panama Canal and attempted to reap the benefits of chartering its ships. “Given the presence of Chinese companies in port operations and infrastructure near the canal, U.S. officials worry that Beijing may seek commercial or strategic leverage in the region,” Umud Shokri, senior visiting fellow at George Mason University with expertise in foreign policy, told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “The Trump administration’s efforts to regain influence over the canal reflect Washington’s broader view of the waterway as a critical national security asset.” The documents center on various cases involving three Hong Kong-based shipping companies—Grace Shipping, Expander Shipping, and Grandest Shipping—all of which have been accused of being subsidiaries of the state-owned Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines, a Tehran-based company owned by the Iranian government. IRISL was sanctioned under the first Trump administration, with the State Department describing the company as the “preferred shipping line for Iranian proliferators and procurement agents.” The EU went into more detail than did the Panamanian courts. The EU Council, charged with overseeing security, defense and diplomacy said that for years, IRISL has been “involved in shipping military related cargo,” while the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Navy “converts container ships owned by IRISL into drone carriers.” Iran has clandestinely operated in the Panama Canal for years, as the Latin American country is considered to be the world’s biggest supplier for “flags of convenience,” which allow shippers to register their vessels under Panamanian colors in exchange for a fee to conceal their port of origin, according to Reuters. Panama took away its flag usage privileges from 136 ships alone over their links to Tehran in 2023. In 2018, the Hong Kong-based companies were looking to sell three separate medium-range tanker ships through an agreement known as a bareboat charter to a Greece-based shipping company. But President Donald Trump announced sanctions on Iran that same year, effectively killing the deal and forcing the Iranian-backed companies to sell the ships outright to avoid penalties. The Greek company went on to use the ships unimpeded for two years after the 2018 sale. However, in 2020, the Hong Kong companies filed a lawsuit in Panamanian court to reclaim the ships from firms under the Greek company’s management that bought the vessels, alleging that the initial selloffs were invalid. The Panamanian court ordered the Greek company to return two of the ships to Grandest Shipping and Expander Shipping, respectively, or pay off the multimillion-dollar valuation of the ships to the plaintiffs, according to the legal documents. The case involving Grace Shipping has yet to be resolved. Though the companies now deny their association with IRISL, they have yet to disclose what third parties they were sold to and the nature of the supposed sales. The only people who have appeared as witnesses in the case for the companies are Iranians related to IRISL, according to court documents. The Hong Kong-based firms are represented by Arias B. & Associates in Panama, court documents show. China’s presence in the Panama Canal has allowed Iran to take its business to the Western Hemisphere right under the nose of the U.S. “China has become unabashed in its unwillingness to comply with U.S. efforts to stop Iranian illicit behavior, and has, in fact, enabled it,” Rebeccah L. Heinrichs, senior fellow and director of the Keystone Defense Initiative at the Hudson Institute, told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “China is the one of the most effective enablers of Iran’s ability to evade U.S. sanctions.” The U.S.’ ability to curtail China-based front companies is partly a function of America’s willingness to potentially strain the U.S.-China business relationships, Heinrichs told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “So some of this is just implementing the sanctions, finding the front companies that pop up and not giving China any plausible deniability,” Heinrichs told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “All of this is endorsed by and facilitated by the [Chinese Communist Party].” Iran has long made moves to avoid Western sanctions, especially in its oil trade. President Donald Trump sanctioned Iranian minister of petroleum Mohsen Paknejad Thursday for allowing “the export of tens of billions of dollars worth of Iranian oil and has allocated billions of dollars’ worth of oil to Iran’s armed forces for export,” according to the Treasury Department. The Iranian government operates so-called shadow fleets that export primarily to Beijing. An entire shadow market for Iranian oil has emerged with China and Russia’s help. Beijing and Moscow have both taken steps to obfuscate the origins of the oil, according to the Atlantic Council. “I think we need to be very serious about Iran sanctions,” Matthew Levitt, director of the Reinhard Program on Counterterrorism and Intelligence at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “But being serious about Iran sanctions does not mean just listing more entities, listing more boats. I’m a former senior Treasury official. I’m all in favor of doing that. Can you do that without enforcement? It’s meaningless.” Panama has been more than happy to accommodate China in its expansion of maritime power. China’s Landbridge Group acquired Panama’s largest Atlantic port, Margarita Island, for $900 million in 2016. The acquisition was in conjunction with Beijing’s Belt and Road Initiative, a global infrastructure project that has already made its way into a myriad of developing nations. The Belt and Road Initiative has been criticized for often giving China undue leverage over the target countries with debt, dubbed “debt-trap diplomacy,” according to the Council on Foreign Relations. Panama formally joined the Belt and Road Initiative in 2017. Moreover, Panama gave a 25-year no-bid renewal to the Hong Kong-based Hutchison Ports to operate two ports on either end of the canal, covering both the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. However, American investment giant BlackRock agreed to purchase the ports from the China-based firm on March 5 for $22.8 billion. U.S. officials and congressmen, such as Republican Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Republican Utah Sen. John Curtis, have levied criticism at the Panama Canal Authority for allegedly not doing enough to enforce sanctions, especially against China. The Panama Canal Authority has vehemently pushed back against the accusations, saying they are “not a haven for sanctions evasion.” “The United States has found that Iranian vessels are sometimes flagged by Panama in order to avoid sanctions so that they could sell the fuel that they have and then they can take that money and then use it as they wish,” Louis Sola, chairman of the Federal Maritime Commission, said during a Senate Commerce Committee hearing in January. Cruz also echoed the sentiment during the Commerce Committee hearing, saying the U.S. could not be “idle” while China grows its foothold. “China has always been firmly opposed to illegal and unjustifiable unilateral sanctions and so-called long-arm jurisdiction by the U.S. The international community, including China, has conducted normal cooperation with Iran within the framework of international law,” a Chinese Embassy spokesperson told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “This is reasonable and lawful without harm done to any third party, and deserves to be respected and protected.” “All of this is primarily about control of sea lanes,” Heinrichs told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “So, it’s critically important, and I credit the Trump administration for recognizing that and for understanding it, that you cannot let the Chinese take over the Panama Canal.” The Iranian Foreign Ministry and Arias B. & Associates did not respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.

Title: Trump Pick for Panama Envoy: Chinese Influence Goes Beyond the Canal
URL: https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2025/03/26/trump-pick-for-panama-envoy-chinese-influence-goes-beyond-the-canal/
Time Published: 2025-03-26T15:00:09Z

Kevin Cabrera, President Donald Trump’s nomination as the next U.S. ambassador to Panama, said Tuesday during his confirmation hearing in Congress that China’s influence in Panama extends beyond the canal’s ports. Cabrera explained to Congress that China exerts influence in Panama’s higher education system through Confucius Institute agreements that China signed with all five local universities. Confucius Institutes are academic organizations entirely controlled by the Chinese regime that spread communist ideology and propaganda to teachers and students at international universities. The first such Confucius Institute in Panama was inaugurated in June 2018 during the administration of former Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela — one year after the Central American nation cut ties with Taiwan and simultaneously embraced the Chinese Communist Party’s “One-China Principle,” which states that there is only one China in the world and Taiwan is a “province” of China. Additionally, Cabrera detailed that China has inked agreements with Panama’s State Radio and Television System (SERTV), pointing out that the state media system “definitely never criticizes China.” “But again, I think that the Chinese influence is not just in the canal. It’s also in other areas. I know that they have memorandums of understanding with all five public universities in Panama for Confucius centers,” Cabrera said. “And they also have a relationship with the local government-owned TV, SERTV, where they provide information, which many times is put in an uncritical, it definitely never criticizes China, what goes on, the information they pass along.” Cabrera told Congress that, if confirmed as ambassador, he will work alongside President Donald Trump, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and members of the House Foreign Relations Committee to continue to diminish Chinese influence in Panama while providing opportunities for American investment in the Central American nation. Additionally, Cabrera expressed his concern on the use of Chinese technology used in Panamanian infrastructure and listed the implementation of Chinese-made security cameras in the city of north-central city of Colón — where the Atlantic Ocean entrance to the Panama Canal is located — and the use of Chinese-made cranes in Colón’s port of Manzanillo, operated by a subsidiary of the Washington-based Carrix marine terminal and rail yard operators company. Cabrella stressed that the use of Chinese cameras and equipment could compromise cybersecurity and access to sensitive information. “We have seen how Chinese state-owned companies can bid significantly lower prices in tenders to ensure that governments buy their technology, Cabrera reportedly said. “This raises questions about who controls the information and whether these infrastructures can be manipulated.” President Trump started an ongoing debate over the Panama Canal in December after he expressed that the United States should take back control of the Canal due to the “exorbitant” transit fees imposed on U.S. ships and because of the growing influence of China in the important trade route. Control of the Panama Canal, which the United States built, was handed over to Panama in 1999 as per the terms of an agreement signed by both nations in 1977 during the administration of former U.S. President Jimmy Carter. Over the past months, President Mulino, officials from the Panama Canal Authority, and other Panamanian government authorities have repeatedly refuted President Trump’s claims and denied any Chinese influence in the Canal. Mulino has also insisted that his administration will not engage in any talks with the United States pertaining to the control of the Panama Canal. Cabrera stressed to Congress that both President Trump and Secretary Rubio have identified possible violations of Article IV of the 1977 Panama Canal Neutrality Treaty signed by former Presidents Jimmy Carter and Omar Torrijos, which states that the U.S. and Panama agree to maintain a regime of neutrality in the Panama Canal so that it remain “permanently neutral.” Cabrera identified the Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison Holdings Limited’s sale to BlackRock of its subsidiary that currently operates two ports at the Panama Canal as a positive step in reducing Chinese influence in the country. Bloomberg reported on Wednesday morning that despite China’s “anger” over the transaction, CK Hutchison Holdings Limited’s sale of the two Panama Canal ports to BlackRock is “moving ahead as scheduled.” Christian K.

Title: Fidelity Reportedly Preparing to Debut In-House Stablecoin

Asset manager Fidelity Investments is reportedly preparing to launch its own stablecoin. The Boston-based company, which manages more than $5 trillion in assets, is in the advanced stages of testing the coin, the Financial Times (FT) reported Wednesday (March 25), citing sources familiar with the matter. According to the report, the planned launch is part of Fidelity’s expansion into the burgeoning market for tokenized versions of US Treasuries. The report adds that the company has also recently filed to introduce a digital version of a U.S. money market fund at the end of May, which would put it in competition with rival asset management groups BlackRock and Franklin Templeton. As the report notes, Fidelity is making these efforts at a time when federal regulators are changing their attitude toward cryptocurrencies in the wake of President Donald Trump’s election last year. Trump had embraced crypto on the campaign trail — marking a contrast with the stricter approach by the Biden White house — and has pledged to promote the growth of dollar-backed stablecoins. There is also a pair of stablecoin bills before Congress. Fidelity published a report earlier this year arguing that central banks and world governments would be among the next “significant investors” in bitcoin. That report noted that while many countries hold bitcoin, it is typically through government seizures and recoveries from criminal prosecutions. Many governments also have rules for the selling or handling of this bitcoin and can’t list them as part of their treasury. “We expect 2025 to be the year this changes for both acceptance and adoption,” wrote Fidelity’s Matt Hogan. “This is to say, we anticipate more nation-states, central banks, sovereign wealth funds, and government treasuries will look to establish strategic positions in bitcoin.” Meanwhile, PYMNTS wrote last week about use cases for stablecoins beyond crypto market liquidity, with applications that include cross-border payments. “Traditional international transactions remain slow and expensive, burdened by correspondent banking networks and legacy financial systems,” that report said. “Stablecoins, pegged to fiat currencies, promise a faster and cheaper alternative. By leveraging blockchain rails, stablecoins can bypass intermediaries, facilitating near-instantaneous settlements at potentially lower costs.” For the Outlook 2030 B2B event at the end of last year, PYMNTS spoke with Ran Goldi, SVP, payments and network at Fireblocks, and Nikola Plecas, Visa Crypto’s head of commercialization, to explore the benefits and myths surrounding blockchain-based payments. This included a discussion of the concept of the “stablecoin sandwich,” a method of using stablecoins to transfer value between currencies, which helps illustrate blockchain’s efficiency in cross-border transactions.

The March dip attracted massive buyers as over $470M SOL were withdrawn from exchanges. Fidelity, a $15 trillion asset manager, has joined the U.S. spot Solana [SOL] exchange-traded funds (ETF) race. On the 25th of March, the firm filed a 19b-4 form with the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission), via Cboe BZX exchange for a spot SOL ETF. Only BlackRock was yet to make a similar application. But Grayscale, 21Shares, Bitwise, Canary Capital, and VanEck had done so. The market’s expectation for approval was high, at 86% per Polymarket. In fact, in February, the agency acknowledged all the filings and subsequently entered them into the Federal Register (FR), triggering the 240-day window for an approval decision. As of this writing, Franklin Templeton’s filing was yet to hit the FR. Unsurprisingly, Fidelity’s move was expected after registering a trust in Delaware on the 20th of March, a common pathway for issuers eyeing a new ETF filing. After recent ETF futures approval and a subsequent debut on CME Futures, SOL was the top contender in the altcoin ETF lineup. Other altcoins like Litecoin [LTC], Polkadot [DOT], Avalanche [AVAX], Sui [SUI], and Dogecoin [DOGE] also saw ETF interest amongst issuers. However, Nate Geraci of ETF Store projected that the agency might not greenlight all altcoin ETFs. “Optimistic on approval of various altcoin ETFs (but SEC will likely draw line somewhere). Quite a bit of debate around whether advisors want broad crypto exposure ETFs vs targeting single crypto ETFs. I’m bullish on broad crypto ETFs.” On markets, speculators betted on the altcoin’s price upside. Notably, over the past seven days, holders withdrew approximately $70M of SOL from exchanges, signaling bullish expectations for the future. Source: Coinglass Coinglass data showed that over $470M SOL was moved from exchanges in the past three weeks alone. The demand triggered the altcoin to bounce nearly 30% from the March low of $112. However, bulls had to clear the $150 hurdle to climb higher, or short sellers could regain the market edge.

Title: Best Crypto Presales to Watch as BlackRock Bets on Bitcoin

Bitcoin may be taking a breather, but behind the scenes, the giants are quietly stacking chips. The latest move? BlackRock, the world’s biggest asset manager, has launched a physically backed spot Bitcoin ETP in Europe called iShares Bitcoin ETP. Yes, the same BlackRock whose IBIT fund in the US made waves as one of the most successful Bitcoin ETF launches in history. When the whales start swimming, minnows take notice, and it’s not Bitcoin alone that’s attracting attention. We look at three of the best crypto presales that investors have been flocking to, but first, more about what BlackRock’s been up to. BlackRock doesn’t just toss darts. Their latest European Bitcoin ETP follows the roaring success of IBIT, which quickly became one of the most successful ETF launches in history. This isn’t a side hustle. It’s a signal. Larry Fink, BlackRock’s CEO, once called Bitcoin an ‘index of money laundering.’ Now, he’s all in. If that’s not a 180, we don’t know what is. And as BlackRock expands its crypto exposure into Europe, it tells us one thing: the institutional floodgates aren’t just open – they’re flooding. Bitcoin’s Hash Ribbon is an on-chain metric that tracks Bitcoin miners’ health and behavior. When it flips bullish, it usually means miners have stopped panic-selling and started hoarding coins again. Historically, it’s been a sure sign of an incoming rally. So, with BlackRock going full steam ahead on $BTC, and technical indicators flashing green, what’s the smart money move? Just before the next $BTC rally, Bitcoin is always the big play. But those who caught Ethereum in 2016 or Dogecoin in 2020 know the biggest gains can come through smaller players if you get in while they’re still small. So, let’s talk about some of the new kids on the blockchain, three of the best crypto presales you’ll want on your radar before the rocket takes off: If BlackRock is the heavyweight champ in the Bitcoin arena, BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) is an ambitious contender with serious crowd appeal. At its core, $BTCBULL is a reflection-based token that aims to amplify exposure to Bitcoin. When the price of $BTC moves up, $BTCBULL is designed to react even stronger – thanks to its tokenomics and smart contract mechanics. That means you’re not just betting on Bitcoin. You’re turbocharging the bet. Right now, you can buy $BTCBULL for just $0.00243, and the project has already raised over $4.1M in presale. That’s no small feat for a token that hasn’t even hit the main exchanges yet. There’s more under the hood. One of the token’s standout features is its Bitcoin airdrop system. As Bitcoin hits key milestones – $125K, $150K, and beyond – holders of $BTCBULL will receive $BTCBULL and $BTC airdrops. But there’s a catch: airdrops are only distributed to those who bought $BTCBULL via Best Wallet and continue holding it there. If you’re holding your tokens somewhere else, even in a cold wallet, you’ll miss the party. So if you’re chasing those juicy $BTC rewards, make sure you’re in the right wallet and ready for the next breakout. Next up is Meme Index ($MEMEX) – a token that could only exist in 2025. Picture this: what if there were a single index token that tracked the performance of top meme coins like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Pepe? That’s exactly what Meme Index is. Meme Index is made up of four unique indexes: Meme Titan, Meme MidCap, Meme Moonshot, and Meme Frenzy. Each one targets a different layer of the meme coin market, from established giants to up-and-coming underdogs and ultra-volatile moonshots. The platform uses automated smart contracts to track, weigh, and rebalance the top meme coins based on market cap and liquidity. $MEMEX holders automatically gain diversified exposure to the meme coin market – no active trading required. It’s meme investing made passive. If Dogecoin taught us anything, it’s that memes can turn into gold. $MEMEX isn’t just banking on it – it’s systematizing it. It might sound like a meme, but the index structure makes it a surprisingly smart play. You get exposure to the meme coin space, without having to put all your eggs in the Doge basket. In the rapidly evolving crypto landscape, Dawgz AI ($DAWGZ) is making waves by merging the playful essence of meme culture with cutting-edge artificial intelligence. Dawgz AI is an AI agent that stands out by offering powerful, automated AI trading bots designed to scan, analyze, and trade the crypto markets 24/7. These bots aren’t just fast – they’re trained on real-time data and refined by continuous machine learning to optimize decision-making and maximize returns. Whether you’re a seasoned investor or someone who panics during market dips, Dawgz AI aims to take the stress out of trading. The platform also includes an intuitive dashboard for monitoring performance and a suite of tools that lets you customize risk levels, strategies, and even tap into community-voted bot upgrades. The goal? Make AI-driven trading simple, efficient, and fun. $DAWGZ is currently in presale at $0.00345, and the project has already raised nearly $3M, reflecting strong investor confidence in the idea of democratizing AI trading. Let’s be real – Bitcoin isn’t going to zero. Not when BlackRock’s buying in. Not when miners are hoarding. And definitely not when the Hash Ribbon flashes bullish like it just did. But while $BTC is gearing up for its next leg up, the smartest money often finds the breakout stars before they hit the headlines. So whether you’re into altcoins, or just hunting for the best presale of 2025, now’s the time to act. Because once the market starts running again, hesitation will be the most expensive decision of all. As always, don’t forget to do your own research (DYOR) – crypto investments are highly volatile and carry risks, especially during presales. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

ByBilly Bambrough ByBilly Bambrough Senior Contributor. 03/26 update below. This post was originally published on March 25 Bitcoin has surged over the last week as traders bet U.S. president Donald Trump could be pulling back from his threat of global trade tariffs (though fears are swirling over a new, mystery threat). Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes’ CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" The bitcoin price has added around 10% since its early March lows but remains well off its peak of almost $110,000 per bitcoin set in January despite a a White House official revealing how Trump could spur the bitcoin price higher. Now, as a BlackRock executive predicts a “big catalyst” for bitcoin could be on the horizon, traders are braced for meme stock darling GameStop to make a bitcoin-related announcement when it reports fourth-quarter results after Tuesday’s market close—potentially following in the footsteps of Michael Saylor’s Strategy. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run U.S. president Donald Trump hosted bitcoin and crypto company executives, including Strategy's ...

Last month, GameStop received a proposal from Strive Asset Management recommending that the brick-and-mortar video game retailer convert its $5 billion in cash reserves into bitcoin, a move it claims would transform the company into the "premier bitcoin treasury company in the gaming sector." Strive Asset Management chief executive Matt Cole told GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen that he “has an incredible opportunity." “Letter received,” Cohen then posted to X. Just weeks earlier, Cohen set social media alight when he posted a picture of himself with Michael Saylor, the founder of software company turned acquisition vehicle Strategy. 03/26 update: GameStop has followed through with teased plans to adopt bitcoin, aping Michael Saylor’s Strategy that’s built up the world’s biggest corporate stash of bitcoin—with self-styled “bitcoin historian” Pete Rizzo telling traders to “buckle up.” While GameStop has $4.75 billion in cash and said it plans to use some of this cash as well as future debt or equity issuances to buy bitcoin, it didn't commit to an amount, somewhat disappointing those who had hoped the company would reveal a firm bitcoin-buy. GameStop's "investment policy permits investments in certain cryptocurrency assets, including bitcoin and U.S. dollar-denominated stablecoins, and if the company acquires bitcoin or U.S. dollar denominated stablecoins, the company will be exposed to certain risks associated with bitcoin or stablecoins, respectively," the company's fourth-quarter earnings report read. GameStop’s stock has climbed almost 20% overnight after the announcement, though it remains well below the sky-high levels it reached in 2021. Meme stock traders, unofficially led by Keith "Roaring Kitty" Gill, helped send the stock price of companies, including GameStop and cinema chain AMC, to astronomical levels alongside cryptocurrencies like dogecoin. Traders are betting GameStop could become the next Strategy, which has seen its stock explode 3,000% since it started buying bitcoin in the summer of 2020. "Welcome to team bitcoin, Ryan Cohen," Saylor posted to X along with the photo of their pair. That growing team includes Metaplanet and Semler Scientific, both of which have adopted so-called bitcoin treasury strategies. “Overall, news about crypto initiatives could make GameStop stock even more susceptible to sharp movements," analysts at crypto payments platform B2BinPay, said in emailed comments. “In the short term, this has already acted as a positive decision, as reflected in the company’s stock growth, however, it also carries risks of volatility. Stablecoins, of course, won’t carry those risks, but bitcoin can go both ways — offering potential for growth but also for a drop. So if the crypto market takes a big hit, it could negatively affect GameStop’s financial standing.” Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has rocketed higher over the last year, recently falling back from its all-time ...

Strategy, until recently known as MicroStrategy, now holds around 500,000 bitcoin worth $42 billion after it began aggressively buying bitcoin in 2020. Saylor was one of a handful of bitcoin and crypto company executives that attended the White House digital asset summit hosted by U.S. president Donald Trump earlier this month. Last week, Saylor predicted there’s about to be a “Cambrian explosion” of companies and countries buying bitcoin during a Blockworks podcast.

Title: With 600 mile range and $9K price, maybe it really SHOULD be the new Model 2

The SGMW Wuling Hongguang EV offers Chinese car buyers five or seven-seat configurations, 300 km of range (that’s about 185 miles to you and me), and a $9,600 price tag – but it’s the 1000 km EREV version that would take the US by storm in 2025. Context: this is an opinion/satire piece, so get that out of the way and have some fun. Despite the fact that we still have the same POTUS we did in 2020 and that familiar sense of impeding, civilization-wide collapse has never quite went away after David Bowie died and they shot the gorilla, the automotive world has changed quite a bit since Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced an affordable, $25,000 Tesla “Model 2” at the company’s now infamous 2020 Battery Day event. Back then, it seemed like just about every automaker this side of the Pacific was announcing plans to go “fully electric” by 2030 or 2035 or whatever in a cynical bid to emulate TSLA and its trillion-dollar market cap. It’s 2025 now, the shareholder cash grab didn’t take, and Toyota’s pocket Senator Joe Manchin succeeded in advancing the company’s “hybrids are electric” cause by lowering the rebate floor for battery-powered vehicles to just 7 kWh. With batteries still being the limiting reagent in America’s EV reaction, the name of the game now is plug-in hybrids and EREVs – and with Musk buddying to the Indian and Chinese governments, US oil lobbyists, and hoping to sell more cars to a cash-strapped middle America, the timing feels right for an affordable EREV Tesla. This is the one. Eggs are still $9 here in Chicago, despite what Chester Cheetah promised on the campaign trail. Rent is still high, and utility prices are about to start creeping up, too. What’s more, there are currently zero new cars with an MSRP below $20,000 for sale in the US, where the average transaction price for a new vehicle has crept up to $48,039 (more than the median annual income at the last census, by the way). The time is right, in other words, for Tesla to roll out a car exactly like the SGMW Wuling Hongguang EREV. And by “exactly like,” I mean exactly. Like. This is how I think a multinational Wuling Tesla rebadge Model 2 could work, and benefit all of Elon’s other plans: If you squint, the Wuling Hongguang already looks like it might the 7/8 scale offspring of a first-gen Model Y and a Kia Rondo. Heck, Tesla might not even have to change the logo because: how many Tesla logos have they really seen in South Dakota, you know? It wouldn’t even be the first time Tesla (or its CEO) repurposed someone else’s engineering and put their name on it. The original Tesla Roadster was essentially a re-powered Lotus Elise with a body kit, wasn’t it? Tesla is a "tech" company that marks itself as the "Apple" of cars, meaning it is exorbitantly priced, filled with fancy gadgetry and thus expensive. What the public needs and can afford is a very basic no-frills shoebox design daily-driver moving at flow-of-traffic crawl speed. Of course it was, and this new Tesla Model 2 could be just as great, thanks to a rear-wheel drive layout paired with a relatively low-weight, sport-tuned chassis and 200 combined hp from its 1.5L range extender and 75 kW electric motor. The 8.5 kWh DCFC-capable lithium iron phosphate battery pack is good for about 35 miles (50 km) of all-electric range – but they’ll sell the car’s 1,000 km “total range.” It might even have more genuine performance cred than this LeMans-inspired French cargo van, and that thing costs over $50K! That’s my take, anyway – let me know what you think in the comments. SOURCES | IMAGES: links throughout; photos by Wuling, via CarNewsChina. FTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links. More.

Title: Exploring Telecom's Four Strategic Options For Navigating Change
URL: https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbesbusinesscouncil/2025/03/26/exploring-telecoms-four-strategic-options-for-navigating-change/
Time Published: 2025-03-26T11:45:00Z
Full Content:
ByClaudio Saes ByClaudio Saes Forbes Councils Member. Claudio Saes is a partner and telecom practice leader at Bell Labs Consulting, a group of the award-winning Nokia Bell Labs. It has been more than a year since I last wrote about the global telecommunication landscape scenario. In that article, I provided my view of four possible strategic options telecom providers could explore to adapt to "ever-increasing data transmission rates": subsidies, mergers and acquisitions (M&As), infrastructure split and network facilitation. In this article, I want to review what's happened in recent years in the realms of these four strategic imperatives, the possible outcomes and considerations for telecom operators moving forward. In my original article, I advocated for the importance of subsidies, but there's a risk of confining telecom operators, original equipment manufacturers and their customers. At the time, the Broadband Equity, Access and Deployment (BEAD) program in the U.S. was seen as the solution to bringing the country fast, reliable connectivity. Fast forward to today, and the BEAD program has shown mixed results. While it aims to expand broadband access in underserved areas and help local businesses flourish with high-speed internet access, the rollout faces challenges, such as complex regulations. While all participating states and territories have approved their "internet for all" plans, some have pointed out that navigating state-level regulations and bureaucratic red tape could delay project implementation, echoing the initial concern about subsidies potentially creating dependency. For instance, certain smaller internet service providers rely on government grants, which raises the question of how sustainable these deployments might be once the funds dry up. Despite these challenges, the overall impact of subsidies has been constructive. With the new U.S. administration, I believe there may be an opening for the possibility of using low Earth orbit satellite technology and lowering regulation requirements for the skilled labor force. My second strategic imperative was related to M&As. In 2024, relevant moves took place in the U.S. market. Led by Verizon's $20 billion acquisition of Frontier Communications in the U.S., the Americas accounted for 62% of last year's global telecom M&A deal value. T-Mobile acquired fiber internet provider Metronet for $4.9 billion, which boosted its fixed broadband capabilities. This acquisition allowed T-Mobile to expand its home internet services and compete more effectively in the fixed broadband market. Bell Canada Enterprises (BCE) made a surprising move by acquiring Ziply Fiber, a fiber internet provider based in Washington. This strategic investment gives Bell a foothold in the U.S. market and access to a new fiber network infrastructure. Last year also saw an increase in technology, media and telecommunications M&A activities compared to 2023. With $514 billion in deals, the landscape is evolving faster than ever, and we might see others following in 2025. Investors and companies targeting acquisitions should be prepared to scrutinize asset values and possible future investments. The infrastructure split trend has gained momentum, with several notable fiber companies’ deals in 2024. For instance, in a joint venture with BlackRock, AT&T spun off its fiber assets into a separate entity, GigaPower, and the companies said last year they wanted to expand that venture, according to Fierce Network. Additionally, AT&T expanded its fiber reach through partnerships with four open-access providers in late 2024, Fierce Network also said. The move will allow AT&T to expand its open fiber solution to its own subscribers in new areas and share the costs of deployment with third-party internet service providers. Telecom Italia completed a significant split by spinning off its fixed landline network. This move aimed to streamline operations and help the company compete more effectively. I'm finding this split model is becoming increasingly common as it provides clarity on the value of underlying network infrastructure and opens opportunities for coinvestment from technology partners or private equity. Telecom CEOs must have their eyes and hearts open for such a competitive strategy move, even if that means disrupting your own market first before others do it. Network facilitation has seen significant advancements, particularly in network slicing, data center interconnect and consumable bandwidth solutions. For example: 1. Network Slicing: T-Mobile was the first operator worldwide to shift to a standalone nationwide 5G network in August 2020, and the company started providing network slicing for some events in 2023. 2. Data Center Interconnect: EdgeConneX, a global hyperscale and hyperlocal data center provider, continued to expand last year to offer data center interconnect solutions ranging from mid to large data centers internationally. 3. Consumable Bandwidth Solutions: AT&T partnered with Equinix in 2022 to provide its customers with geo-redundant cloud on-ramps, according to an Equinix blog titled "5 Equinix Fabric Use Cases for Network Service Providers." This collaboration allows AT&T's clients to access cloud availability zones across Equinix's global footprint, the blog also said. I've found there’s a consensus that Network-as-a-Service won’t be widespread due to integration complexity and cost. However, I believe the telcos that have contracts with medium and large enterprises are the ones that benefit the most from these value-added services, especially in light of the AI investment surge. As we reflect on the developments across these four strategic imperatives, it's clear that the telecom industry continues to evolve rapidly. The interplay among subsidies, M&As, infrastructure strategies and network facilitation shapes a new landscape where traditional boundaries are blurring and new opportunities are emerging. Whether a telco embraces strategic partnerships for infrastructure expansion, leverages M&As for competitive positioning or capitalizes on NaaS for enterprise growth, it is imperative to reassess its organization and governance structure. In our experience, companies fail to meet time to market and get lost in pursuing new initiatives with existing organizations, so they're unable to reap the benefits of a new strategic direction. Looking ahead, the industry must navigate challenges such as regulatory uncertainties, technological disruptions and lower operating margins. However, those that can effectively leverage these strategic imperatives will be well-positioned to thrive in the ever-changing telecom ecosystem. Forbes Business Council is the foremost growth and networking organization for business owners and leaders. Do I qualify?

Largest ETF issuers aren’t going to ignore this.” Geraci, who had already forecast a spot ETF filing by BlackRock in mid-March, reiterated that it is increasingly plausible that major asset managers will seek to tap into top altcoins beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. On March 14, he wrote: “I’m ready to log formal prediction… BlackRock will file for both solana & xrp ETFs. Solana could be any day. Think XRP once SEC lawsuit concluded.” The expert emphasized that BlackRock is currently the leader (followed by Fidelity) by assets under management for both spot Bitcoin and spot Ethereum ETF. “I simply don’t see them allowing competitors to come in & launch ETFs on 2 of the top 5 non-stablecoin crypto assets w/out any sort of fight. I also believe BlackRock will file for crypto index ETFs btw,” Geraci stated. Notably, yesterday’s filing by Fidelity for a spot Solana ETF filing appears to reinforce the notion that leading fund issuers are stepping into the altcoin ETF domain. Geraci’s renewed optimism comes on the heels of yesterday’s announcement from Ripple Chief Legal Officer (CLO) Stuart Alderoty, who provided what he characterized as his “last update on SEC v Ripple ever.” Last week, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) agreed to drop its appeal against Ripple. “Ripple has now agreed to drop its cross-appeal. The SEC will keep $50M of the $125M fine (already in an interest-bearing escrow in cash), with the balance returned to Ripple. The agency will also ask the Court to lift the standard injunction that was imposed earlier at the SEC’s request. All subject to Commission vote, drafting of final documents and usual court processes,” Alderoty revealed. Nonetheless, pro-XRP attorney Fred Rispoli has clarified via X that the case is not entirely concluded until the SEC’s formal vote and subsequent filings have been processed. Based on standard timelines, Rispoli suggests it could take up to 30 days for the Commission to vote and another 30 days for Judge Torres to sign off on lifting the injunction. In the best-case scenario, observers could see a fully resolved matter within roughly 60 days. The formal conclusion of the SEC lawsuit against Ripple would ostensibly remove a central barrier to major institutional products tied to XRP, thereby making Geraci’s spot XRP ETF prediction more plausible. At press time, XRP traded at $2.4495. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email. Jake Simmons has been a Bitcoin enthusiast since 2016.

Title: Bitcoin Rally To $95K? Market Greed Suggests It’s Possible

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Bitcoin is on everyone’s crosshairs once more. The cryptocurrency shot up to $88,500 today, exciting traders who think the price will rise to $95,000 in the near term. But while optimism is high, so is caution. Some analysts are warning that a retreat back to $80,000 may occur before the next major rally starts. Market intelligence platform Santiment reports that greed is building among crypto investors. References of Bitcoin reaching $100,000 or even as high as $159,000 have surged through social media platforms. While hope is generating all the excitement, Santiment reminds that such peaks in greed generally precede an imminent price adjustment. 🤑 As crypto has bounced nicely in the second half of March, traders have swung the pendulum back toward mild greed. After showing major fear in late February and early March following two stints of Bitcoin dipping as low as $78K, it appears that this rebound to $88.5K has… pic.twitter.com/WGvmvKSv2X — Santiment (@santimentfeed) March 25, 2025 Traders had also been holding back earlier in the year when Bitcoin fell to a low of $78,000. But that recent spike back to $88,500 does appear to have changed the general sentiment. Santiment suggests this might be an ideal time for traders to consider taking profits. Bitcoin miners appear to be confident about the future. According to data from CryptoQuant, miners have not been selling much of their Bitcoin recently. In fact, miner reserves now total 1.81 million BTC, which is worth around $159 billion. Ali Martinez, a crypto analyst, confirmed in a comment on X that no significant selling activity has been recorded among miners over the past 24 hours. This behavior could be a sign that miners are expecting higher prices and prefer to hold onto their earnings for now. Institutional investors are also playing a big role in the market’s momentum. On March 25, Bitcoin spot ETFs in the US recorded a total daily inflow of $27 million. BlackRock, one of the largest asset management firms, led the way with $42 million in inflows that day. Whereas some other funds such as Bitwise and WisdomTree experienced $10 million and $5 million outflows respectively, the robust demand for BlackRock helped in nudging the general trend into positive direction. BlackRock’s net assets in its Bitcoin spot ETF are currently at a little over $50 billion, demonstrating that institutional investors still have a passion for Bitcoin. Technical analysis is indicating Bitcoin might experience a temporary decline before the next peak. On its 4-hour chart, Bitcoin is having a difficult time surpassing a trendline of resistance, creating what experts refer to as a “double top” formation. The pattern suggests the potential for a price drop towards $85,000. Meanwhile, the most important support level is at $86,146, according to the 61.80% Fibonacci retracement level. If Bitcoin manages to stay above this level, analysts indicate that the price may rebound and move towards $95,000.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Title: Ripple SEC settlement – Partial fine stays, injunction to be lifted

What’s next for XRP as regulatory headwinds clear with pending SEC settlement? Ripple [XRP] reportedly settled with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This followed after the agency dropped its appeal against the firm without condition last week. According to Ripple’s Legal Chief Stuart Alderoty, the $125M fine for unregistered ‘institutional XRP sales’ was reduced to $50M as part of the agreement. Alderory stated, “The SEC will keep $50M of the $125M fine, with the balance returned to Ripple. The agency will also ask the Court to lift the standard injunction that was imposed earlier at the SEC’s request.” Here, the injunction referred to Judge Analisa Torres’s ruling that barred Ripple from future sales of XRP tokens, especially to institutions that could be deemed unregistered security offerings. The agreement was subject to a Commission vote. But policy watchers speculated it could be officially over within two months. According to pro-crypto attorney Fred Rispoli, “Then we wait on filing by SEC to lift injunction, which will be unopposed by Ripple. Judge Torres will sign off on it (less than 30 days from motion filing). At most, we are 60 days out from this being 100%, formally, legally, and spectacularly over.” Rispoli added that the case would be revisited only if no legislation was passed before 2028 and a crypto-hostile regime got into power. However, U.S. lawmakers were on track to pass legislation for stablecoins and crypto market structure by 2025. In fact, Kristin Smith, CEO of the Blockchain Association, expected them to be passed by August of this year. Besides, the new SEC’s ongoing regulatory rollbacks were part of its push for clarity in the sector. It recently held a roundtable discussion on the security status of crypto assets. In addition, the agency has planned more public events between now and June. These would clarify regulations on crypto trading, custody, tokenization, and DeFi. Reacting to the latest settlement update, Nate Geraci of ETF Store stated, “Ripple lawsuit coming to end…Seems obvious spot XRP ETF approval is simply matter of time IMO. And yes, I expect BlackRock, Fidelity, etc., to all be involved.” On the market side, the whale wallets with 10 million to 100 million XRP coins were on a steady accumulation spree from late February. XRP price was more sensitive to their movements (yellow) than the larger cohort with 100 million to 1 billion coins (they held 10 billion XRP, red). Source: Santiment XRP didn’t bulge on the price chart, perhaps because it had pumped 12% after last week’s dismissal update. With regulatory headwinds out of the way, the next price catalyst would be XRP ETF approval.

Fidelity Investments is in advanced stages of testing its own stablecoin, which is designed to act as cash in cryptocurrency markets and will be managed through its digital assets arm. 1 26 March 2025 Be the first to comment This content has been selected, created and edited by the Finextra editorial team based upon its relevance and interest to our community. The FT reports that Fidelity’s launch is part of its expansion into the nascent market for tokenised versions of US Treasuries. Late last week it filed to launch a digital version of a US money market fund at the end of May, in direct competition with traditional asset manager rivals BlackRock and Franklin Templeton. The move comes as crypto-friendly President Donald Trump pledged to promote the growth of “lawful and legitimate” dollar-backed stablecoins to support the US currency and called for supporting legislation to be ready to be signed into law by August. In no surprise to anyone, World Liberty Financial, the crypto project promoted by Trump and his sons, has also announced plans to launch its own stablecoin. The coin’s reserves will be backed by short-term US Treasuries and other cash equivalents.

Title: World’s Largest Asset Manager BlackRock Unveils First Bitcoin ETP In Europe

BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager and now a major player in the broader crypto landscape, is making headlines again with the upcoming launch of its first Bitcoin exchange-traded product (ETP) in Europe. Following the successful performance of its $48 billion US fund that tracks Bitcoin, the new iShares Bitcoin ETP is set to debut on Xetra and Euronext Paris under the ticker IB1T, and on Euronext Amsterdam under the BTCN ticker on Tuesday. To attract investors from the outset, BlackRock is implementing a temporary fee waiver of 10 basis points, which will reduce the expense ratio to 0.15% until the end of the year. According to Bloomberg, this pricing strategy positions IB1T among the most competitively priced options in the market—significantly cheaper than Europe’s largest crypto ETP, CoinShares International Ltd’s physical Bitcoin product, which charges 0.25%. Manuela Sperandeo, BlackRock’s head of Europe & Middle East iShares Product, commented on the launch, stating that it represents a potential “tipping point” in the industry. The iShares Bitcoin ETP marks BlackRock’s first venture into crypto-linked ETPs outside North America. While similar products have been available in Europe for years, the market—valued at $13.6 billion—remains significantly smaller compared to the US market. BlackRock’s US-listed iShares Bitcoin Trust made headlines upon its launch in January 2024 following the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) approval, quickly accumulating billions in assets and setting records for ETF launches. The physical Bitcoin backing the IB1T will be custodied by Coinbase Global. The product is designed for both institutional and informed retail investors and will be issued by a special purpose vehicle based in Switzerland. In related developments, the asset manager is also expanding its digital asset offerings through collaboration with Securitize, a financial technology company for real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. The BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), which has recently surpassed $1 billion in assets under management, will launch a new share class on the Solana (SOL) blockchain, representing BlackRock’s first tokenized fund to be issued on a public blockchain. Launched in March 2024, BUIDL provides qualified investors with access to US dollar yields on-chain, featuring flexible custody options, daily dividend payouts, and near real-time peer-to-peer transfers. With BUIDL now available on seven blockchains—including Aptos (APT), Arbitrum (ARB), Avalanche (AVAX), Ethereum (ETH), Optimism (OP), and Polygon (POL)—cross-chain interoperability is facilitated by Wormhole, allowing secure and seamless token transfers. Carlos Domingo, co-founder and CEO of Securitize, highlighted the growing demand for tokenized real-world assets and the asset manager’s decision to expand to the Solana blockchain, stating: In the year since BUIDL’s launch, we’ve experienced significant growth in demand for tokenized real-world assets, reinforcing the value of bringing institutional-grade products on-chain. As the market for RWAs and tokenized treasuries gains momentum, expanding BUIDL to Solana—a blockchain known for its speed, scalability, and cost efficiency—is a natural next step At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $88,000, up 8% on a weekly basis. Solana, on the other hand, has seen even greater gains with a price spike of nearly 20% in the same time frame, trading at $145.

Title: Time for businesses to return to their essential purpose

U.S. Federal Housing director Bill Pulte exposes more empty office buildings and wasteful spending in Washington on 'The Ingraham Angle.' Corporate America is poised to unlock its potential as never before. For years, progressive activists have successfully pushed boards of directors and CEOs at top companies to support and promote radical causes that would never stand a chance at the ballot box. The end-result has been to compromise many corporate leaders’ commitment to fulfilling their fiduciary duties and diminished the American economy’s capacity to deliver prosperity for the American people. A correction is long overdue. And it’s finally underway. When businesses try to play politics, they often make things worse rather than better. (Getty Images) Consider the recent news from BlackRock, where CEO Larry Fink has signaled his company’s rejection of legally risky and divisive "Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion" commitments, and abandoned his position as a leader in the so-called "Environmental, Social, and Governance" revolution. DEATH OF DEI IS A MASSIVE REMINDER THERE ARE BETTER WAYS TO RUN A BUSINESSBlackRock’s course correction is confirmation of a massive sea change throughout Corporate America. Other financial giants like State Street and JPMorgan Chase have also ditched DEI, along with household brands like Walmart, Target, McDonald’s and Ford. The list is expansive and should be encouraging to every American CEO, shareholder, consumer and employee. After more than half a decade of allowing their businesses to be weaponized by activists, leaders like Fink are now refocusing on the main goals of businesses. Those goals are at the center of the Good for Business Coalition and our Statement on the Purpose of a Corporation. This coalition’s vision rests on four pillars: creating economic value, maintaining clear accountability to shareholders, avoiding entanglement in political controversies, and advancing the general welfare through business success rather than political advocacy. LAWFARE AND THE DEATH OF DEI AND AFFIRMATIVE ACTION This approach recognizes an essential truth: that businesses serve society best when they focus on what they do best: creating wealth by delivering consumers with goods and services that people need and want. Profit is what drives a pharmaceutical company to develop life-saving medicines. It also drives a technology company to create tools that enhance human capability to do great things that our grandparents could never have imagined. This doesn't mean corporations should be indifferent to broader social questions or have a license to provide unethically. It simply means that their specific contribution to society’s well-being is through doing what business does best. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Through pursuing profit and generating economic value, businesses serve customers, develop innovative products, create jobs and generate returns that help build millions of Americans' retirement savings. If businesses choose, they can also contribute through traditional corporate citizenship such as supporting local communities or engaging in philanthropy. Businesses aren't designed to be political actors – they lack both the democratic legitimacy and the institutional competence for that role. When they try to play politics, they often make things worse rather than better. The path forward is clear: American businesses need to recommit to their fundamental purpose. That means living up to high ethical standards and good business practice, pursuing operational excellence, maintaining clear accountability to shareholders and avoiding unnecessary political entanglements. It means measuring success by the value created for customers and the returns generated for investors. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP When businesses focus on doing what they do best, they create the innovation, prosperity and opportunity that truly advance human flourishing. The business of business is business – not because social issues don't matter, but because this is how business best serves society. And business leaders who reprioritize along these lines deserve our support. It's time for American corporations to remember this fundamental truth and return to their essential purpose.

The iShares Bitcoin ETP (IB1T) is listed on German, French, and Dutch stock exchanges, according to a prospectus on the iShares website. “Each ETP security corresponds to a specific amount of Bitcoin,” the prospectus reads. Decrypt has reached out to BlackRock to learn more. Coinbase, the U.S.’s largest crypto exchange, would custody the digital assets for the investment vehicle, according to the prospectus. BlackRock’s application for a spot Bitcoin ETF in mid-2023 was considered a pivotal moment in their eventual approval in January 2024, given its status as the world’s largest asset manager, with over $11 trillion in assets under management. It's iShares Bitcoin Trust has generated nearly $40 billion in net inflows, the most among the 11 bitcoin funds currently trading, according to U.K. asset manager Farside Investors. Spot Bitcoin funds now control nearly $100 billion in assets. BlackRock’s spot Ethereum fund has received more than $4 billion in assets since it debuted in July 2024. Crypto ETFs have given investors exposure to the asset in a more familiar financial product. Separately, in an announcement Tuesday, tokenization platform Securitize said that it had launched BlackRock’s $1.7 billion tokenized treasury fund BUIDL on the Solana blockchain. “Following the one-year anniversary of BUIDL’s launch, BlackRock and Securitize are expanding access with a new share class on the Solana network,” Securitize said in a post on X. “This milestone marks an important step in the continued institutional adoption of tokenized real-world assets,” it added.
