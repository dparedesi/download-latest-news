Federal antitrust enforcers expressed support on Thursday for arguments wielded by Republican states that accuse asset managers BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street of conspiring through climate activism to decrease coal output. The Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission filed a statement of interest in the case where Texas and 12 other states claim the companies used their substantial holdings in US coal companies to discourage competition. The agencies urged the judge overseeing the case in Tyler, Texas, to reject several of the arguments the asset managers made in their bid to dismiss the case, including that the alleged conduct falls under an exemption for passive investors. “This case is about precisely the sort of conduct, including concerted efforts to reduce output, which have long been condemned under the antitrust laws,” the agencies said in their court brief. BlackRock said that forcing asset managers to divest from coal companies would harm the companies’ access to capital and likely raise energy prices. State Street said it acts in the long-term interests of investors and that the lawsuit is baseless. Vanguard reiterated its prior comment that it would defend its history of safeguarding returns for investors. Reuters first reported earlier on Thursday that the agencies were expected to support the states’ arguments. The development marks a political setback for the top asset managers. With some $27 trillion among them, BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street have come under fire from conservative Republicans, many from energy-producing states, who say the firms wrongly put environmental and social concerns above maximizing returns for their customers. BlackRock, for instance, faces restrictions and outright bans on managing public assets in states including Texas and Indiana over its ESG policies. There were signs of thawing relations in February when the company led a consortium to buy ports near the strategic Panama Canal, a deal hailed by President Trump. The asset managers have called the case “half-baked” and say there is no evidence they pressed for reduced output. US District Judge Jeremy Kernodle is scheduled to hear arguments on the asset managers’ bid to dismiss the case in June.

Title: Trump Admin Throws Weight Behind Lawsuit Alleging Wall Street Embraced ESG To Shut Down Coal

Skip to comments. Posted on 05/22/2025 9:30:27 AM PDT by george76 Brief represents the first time the Trump administration has weighed in on green investing issues.. The Federal Trade Commission is throwing its weight behind a high-profile federal lawsuit led by 12 Republican-led states accusing three of the world's largest asset managers—BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard—of artificially constricting the coal market in violation of U.S. antitrust laws, the Washington Free Beacon has learned. The filing in the case is a remarkable move that represents the first time the Trump administration has waded directly into an issue or case related to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) policies. Led by powerful asset managers and banks, the ESG movement broadly calls for investors to pull money away from traditional energy industries, like coal and oil, and divert it to green energy industries in the fight against global warming. "Competition in coal markets incentivizes companies to produce as much coal as the market demands," the FTC stated in its Thursday brief. "Allowing the marketplace to freely determine the intersection of supply and demand is thus critical to America’s energy security and economic dynamism." "This case is about alleged anticompetitive conduct that increased energy prices for ordinary American consumers and businesses," it continued. The case dates back to November when Texas attorney general Ken Paxton filed a complaint alongside 11 other states, accusing defendants of violating century-old antitrust laws by collectively acquiring substantial ownership stakes in every major coal company in the country before using their newfound influence to pressure the industry to adopt climate goals like cutting coal output in half by 2030. Paxton said those actions have contributed to rising electricity prices. Coal-fired power currently generates less than 15 percent of the nation's total electricity, down from the 33 percent it generated a decade ago, according to federal data. In that same time period, the average price of electricity has steadily increased. In its brief Thursday, filed in the District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, the FTC made clear its interest in protecting Americans from anticompetitive behavior that "reduces the production of domestic energy, raises energy prices for consumers and businesses, and undermines America’s energy dominance." The brief clarified that antitrust laws allow for passive fund investing and that the federal government does not intend to argue otherwise. The case, however, is about the coordinated use of the power to distort output and prices in energy markets, the commission wrote. Paxton's complaint alleged that BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard ultimately deceived thousands of investors "who elected to invest in non-ESG funds to maximize their profits" but whose money was used to pursue ESG strategies. "The President has declared a national energy emergency, and we need competition in coal production now more than ever to help fuel American energy dominance," Abigail Slater, the assistant attorney general for the Justice Department’s antitrust division, said in a statement. "American consumers suffer when institutional asset managers use shareholdings in competing companies to orchestrate output reductions." Texas's complaint accuses defendants of violating the Sherman Act and Clayton Act. Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, West Virginia, and Wyoming joined as plaintiffs. "This is great news for the case and for the country because it helps validate the arguments that Ken Paxton's office and the other states have been making," Will Hild, the executive director of watchdog group Consumers Research and a prominent critic of ESG policies, said in an interview. "What I really hope to see coming out of this is these companies acknowledging that they messed up and figuring out how they're going to make it right for American consumers in these states and then promising never to do it again," he continued. "But I think the pressure is really building in a monumental way." BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The court is expected to rule on the defendants' motion to dismiss in the coming weeks. A hearing on the motion is slated for early June. Critics of the ESG movement say it seeks to improperly boost politically favored green industries that aren't profitable at the expense of more profitable energy industries. In doing so, they argue, ESG policies harm American investors—asset managers that have a legally-mandated fiduciary duty to promote the wellbeing of clients whose money they manage. Citing those arguments, several GOP states like Texas and lawmakers have taken action to block ESG policies nationwide. "Woke corporations are collectively adopting and imposing progressive policy goals that American consumers do not want or do not need," Rep. Jim Jordan (R., Ohio), the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said in 2022 after he launched a sweeping antitrust investigation into Wall Street over ESG. ESG efforts proliferated on Wall Street in recent years, with major financial institutions, including the defendants in Texas's case, joining large net zero coalitions designed to marshal initiatives pushing public companies to reduce their carbon emissions. And the Biden administration itself introduced ESG-related policies at the Securities and Exchange Commission and Department of Labor. President Donald Trump's electoral victory, however, dealt a crippling blow to the ESG movement and, as a result, Wall Street largely backtracked from its previous efforts. For example, the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, a high-profile international coalition whose membership included some of the world's largest banks, suspended operations in January after BlackRock withdrew for unspecified legal reasons. Texas referenced the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative in its November lawsuit, alleging that it was used by defendants to push their ESG objectives.

"This is great news for the case and for the country because it helps validate the arguments that Ken Paxton's office and the other states have been making," Will Hild, the executive director of watchdog group Consumers Research and a prominent critic of ESG policies, said in an interview. "What I really hope to see coming out of this is these companies acknowledging that they messed up and figuring out how they're going to make it right for American consumers in these states and then promising never to do it again," he continued. "But I think the pressure is really building in a monumental way." BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The court is expected to rule on the defendants' motion to dismiss in the coming weeks. A hearing on the motion is slated for early June. Critics of the ESG movement say it seeks to improperly boost politically favored green industries that aren't profitable at the expense of more profitable energy industries. In doing so, they argue, ESG policies harm American investors—asset managers that have a legally-mandated fiduciary duty to promote the wellbeing of clients whose money they manage. Citing those arguments, several GOP states like Texas and lawmakers have taken action to block ESG policies nationwide. "Woke corporations are collectively adopting and imposing progressive policy goals that American consumers do not want or do not need," Rep. Jim Jordan (R., Ohio), the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said in 2022 after he launched a sweeping antitrust investigation into Wall Street over ESG. ESG efforts proliferated on Wall Street in recent years, with major financial institutions, including the defendants in Texas's case, joining large net zero coalitions designed to marshal initiatives pushing public companies to reduce their carbon emissions. And the Biden administration itself introduced ESG-related policies at the Securities and Exchange Commission and Department of Labor. President Donald Trump's electoral victory, however, dealt a crippling blow to the ESG movement and, as a result, Wall Street largely backtracked from its previous efforts. For example, the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, a high-profile international coalition whose membership included some of the world's largest banks, suspended operations in January after BlackRock withdrew for unspecified legal reasons. Texas referenced the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative in its November lawsuit, alleging that it was used by defendants to push their ESG objectives.

Paxton said those actions have contributed to rising electricity prices. Coal-fired power currently generates less than 15 percent of the nation's total electricity, down from the 33 percent it generated a decade ago, according to federal data. In that same time period, the average price of electricity has steadily increased. In its brief Thursday, filed in the District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, the FTC made clear its interest in protecting Americans from anticompetitive behavior that "reduces the production of domestic energy, raises energy prices for consumers and businesses, and undermines America’s energy dominance." The brief clarified that antitrust laws allow for passive fund investing and that the federal government does not intend to argue otherwise. The case, however, is about the coordinated use of the power to distort output and prices in energy markets, the commission wrote. Paxton's complaint alleged that BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard ultimately deceived thousands of investors "who elected to invest in non-ESG funds to maximize their profits" but whose money was used to pursue ESG strategies. "The President has declared a national energy emergency, and we need competition in coal production now more than ever to help fuel American energy dominance," Abigail Slater, the assistant attorney general for the Justice Department’s antitrust division, said in a statement. "American consumers suffer when institutional asset managers use shareholdings in competing companies to orchestrate output reductions." Texas's complaint accuses defendants of violating the Sherman Act and Clayton Act. Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, West Virginia, and Wyoming joined as plaintiffs.

"American consumers suffer when institutional asset managers use shareholdings in competing companies to orchestrate output reductions." Texas's complaint accuses defendants of violating the Sherman Act and Clayton Act. Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, West Virginia, and Wyoming joined as plaintiffs. "This is great news for the case and for the country because it helps validate the arguments that Ken Paxton's office and the other states have been making," Will Hild, the executive director of watchdog group Consumers Research and a prominent critic of ESG policies, said in an interview. "What I really hope to see coming out of this is these companies acknowledging that they messed up and figuring out how they're going to make it right for American consumers in these states and then promising never to do it again," he continued. "But I think the pressure is really building in a monumental way." BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The court is expected to rule on the defendants' motion to dismiss in the coming weeks. A hearing on the motion is slated for early June. Critics of the ESG movement say it seeks to improperly boost politically favored green industries that aren't profitable at the expense of more profitable energy industries. In doing so, they argue, ESG policies harm American investors—asset managers that have a legally-mandated fiduciary duty to promote the wellbeing of clients whose money they manage. Citing those arguments, several GOP states like Texas and lawmakers have taken action to block ESG policies nationwide. "Woke corporations are collectively adopting and imposing progressive policy goals that American consumers do not want or do not need," Rep. Jim Jordan (R., Ohio), the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said in 2022 after he launched a sweeping antitrust investigation into Wall Street over ESG. ESG efforts proliferated on Wall Street in recent years, with major financial institutions, including the defendants in Texas's case, joining large net zero coalitions designed to marshal initiatives pushing public companies to reduce their carbon emissions. And the Biden administration itself introduced ESG-related policies at the Securities and Exchange Commission and Department of Labor. President Donald Trump's electoral victory, however, dealt a crippling blow to the ESG movement and, as a result, Wall Street largely backtracked from its previous efforts. For example, the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, a high-profile international coalition whose membership included some of the world's largest banks, suspended operations in January after BlackRock withdrew for unspecified legal reasons. Texas referenced the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative in its November lawsuit, alleging that it was used by defendants to push their ESG objectives.

Title: Bitcoin Breaks Records as Market Value Hits Historic Peak – Here Are The Key Drivers
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-hits-historic-peak/
Time Published: 2025-05-22T16:30:18Z
Full Content:
The crypto market recently witnessed a historic moment as Bitcoin, the largest digital asset, rallied hard to a new all-time high on Wednesday, triggering renewed optimism in the sector. After the milestone, BTC’s bullish performance has been analyzed and attributed to several key favorable conditions. Since gaining upward traction in April, the market value of Bitcoin has officially risen to a new all-time high of $111,867, surpassing its previous peak at the $109,241 level achieved during United States President Donald Trump’s inauguration on January 20. The notable upsurge to a new peak marks a major turning point in the cryptocurrency’s development as a widely recognized financial instrument. However, this spike is being driven by a combination of strong variables rather than speculative hype. According to Santiment, a leading on-chain data platform, this milestone was reached just six weeks after the news of Trump’s tariffs caused the crypto sector to display extreme FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt). This is a clear example that crypto markets have often moved in the opposite direction of institutional whales’ capital and retail expectations. The on-chain platform has also taken a step to outline the key factors that supported the recent rally to a new all-time high. Aside from the tariffs being lowered and the 90-day truce between the US and China, a major factor behind the BTC’s rally highlighted by Santiment has been the increasing number of institutional investors. This heightened institutional interest has been observed among top asset management firms like BlackRock, Fidelity, Ark Invest, and others. Santiment noted that BlackRock’s interest is evidenced by the expansion of its BTC holdings through its Spot Bitcoin ETF, IBIT, which currently breached the $20 billion milestone. During the period, Fidelity and Ark Invest have also reported record inflows. BTC’s notable surge has triggered bullish sentiment in the sector. Due to ongoing tariff uncertainties and widespread jadedness, there has not been much FOMO, therefore, the path was paved for BTC to finally create history. Over time, Bitcoin has swiftly transformed from a speculative asset to a vital part of diversified investments. This is because of its increasing inclusion in the portfolios of significant asset managers and hedge funds. With the growing presence and crowd’s greed, Santiment is confident that BTC might surge to the $115,000 and $120,000 price range in the near future. Ali Martinez, a crypto analyst and trader, also predicted a continuation of the uptrend, claiming that BTC is entering price discovery. Given the robust performance so far, Martinez believes that the next key levels to watch include $116,000, $126,000, $136,000, and $148,000. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $110,834, demonstrating a nearly 9% increase in the past week. Data from CoinMarketCap shows that investors are capitalizing on the ongoing upward trend as BTC’s trading volume has risen sharply by more than 73% in the past day.

The offering, which covers more than 50 U.S.-listed stocks and exchange-traded funds, will be facilitated through a partnership with Backed, a firm specializing in tokenized securities, using the Solana blockchain to offer so-called xStocks, the company said. Tokenization refers to the process of taking real-world assets, whether stocks or bonds, and representing them on-chain using digital assets. Kraken said that stocks will be represented on Solana using SPL tokens, a token standard mirroring ERC-20 tokens on Ethereum. xStocks, which will be issued on a public blockchain, are expected to trade around the clock. According to Kraken, the exchange and Backed chose Solana as the first chain for xStocks because of its “unmatched performance, low latency and thriving global ecosystem.” However, the company said it will explore tokenized securities on other networks as well. “We’re reimagining equities investing and ushering in a new wave of demand from clients seeking better alternatives to the status quo,” Mark Greenberg, Kraken’s global head of consumer, said. “Access to traditional U.S. equities remains slow, costly, and restricted.” In April, Kraken began offering U.S.-listed stocks and ETFs to U.S.-based customers. The company says it is eyeing similar expansion in the UK, Europe, and Australia. The push comes as the exchange reportedly prepares for an initial public offering this year. Among traditional financial institutions, tokenization has several backers. In 2022, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink hailed the concept as the future of markets, saying that blockchain-based plumbing could yield near-instantaneous settlement and reduced fees. In the U.S., firms like Securitize have emerged as leaders in the tokenization space. The company manages BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) fund, which has a market capitalization of around $2.8 billion, according to analytics firm rwa.xyz. Collapsed crypto exchange FTX waded into the tokenization space in 2020, when it began offering tokenized stocks for marijuana firms. Binance had dabbled in tokenized securities as well, including offering a version of Coinbase’s stock, at one point. Tokenized stocks have a relatively nascent footprint compared to stablecoins or products like BUIDL. According to rwa.xyz, around $373 million worth of tokenized requites exist on-chain, namely Exodus Movement’s stock, which is issued by Securitize on the Algorand blockchain.

Title: Kraken To List Tokenized Version of Nvidia, Apple, Tesla Shares

Kraken plans to list tokenized shares of Nvidia, Apple, Tesla and over 50 other U.S. stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), the Wall Street Journal reported. The tokens, deployed on Solana SOL$180.72, will be known under the name “xStocks” and will be available to trade 24/7 for investors all across the world. Some of the ETFs that will be available to trade include the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY), which tracks the S&P 500 index, and the SPDR Gold Shares (GLD). The stocks will be represented by real shares held by Backed Finance and can be redeemed 1:1 for their cash value. Kraken had announced the initial rollout of over 11,000 U.S.-listed stocks and ETFs in April, starting with 10 U.S. states and offered through Kraken Securities. This latest announcement expands Kraken’s offering to include tokenized versions of over 50 stocks and ETFs to customers outside of the U.S., starting with Europe, Latin America, Africa and Asia. The move puts Kraken in direct competition to platforms like Robinhood (HOOD) and makes it the first exchange to successfully offer tokenized shares of major U.S. stocks. Binance attempted to launch tokenized U.S. stocks in 2021 but canceled their plans eventually due to regulatory uncertainty. A Kraken spokesperson told the Wall Street Journal that the exchange is “actively working with various regulators” to ensure that xStocks can be offered legally in each jurisdiction as regulation varies. Tokenization, which turns real-world assets into blockchain tokens, has become the latest buzz word in crypto with more and more companies starting to enter the space. Some, including Ondo Finance, BlackRock and Franklin Templeton, have long been pioneers in the area, pushing their overall tokenization market to a $65 billion market cap as of May.

Image Credit: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock.com HONG KONG, May 22 (Reuters) – CK Hutchison confirmed on Thursday that Italian billionaire Gianluigi Aponte’s family-run MSC Mediterranean Shipping Company is the main investor in a group seeking to buy 43 ports from the Hong Kong conglomerate. Hutchison co-managing director Dominic Lai was speaking at the company’s annual general meeting following weeks of scrutiny and criticism in China of its proposal to sell most of its $22.8 billion global ports business to a consortium led by U.S. investment firm BlackRock. When asked if the Swiss-headquartered MSC shipping empire, which is controlled by the Aponte family, was the major investor, Lai said: “Yes, it has been from the beginning.” CK Hutchison has not previously disclosed the exact ownership of each investor in the consortium. Shipping Giant MSC Set to Become World’s Largest Terminal Operator in Hutchison Ports Deal MSC did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Lai’s remarks. The sale of assets, which would include two ports along the strategically important Panama Canal, has become highly politicised at a time of intensifying U.S.-China trade tensions. In April, China’s top market regulator said it was paying close attention to CK Hutchison’s planned sale and that parties to the deal should not try to avoid an antitrust review. CK Hutchison, controlled by tycoon Li Ka-shing, said this month that the deal would strictly adhere to all required compliance standards. The proposed sale has also drawn the attention of U.S. President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly expressed his desire to reduce Chinese influence around the Panama Canal and termed the deal a “reclaiming” of the waterway.

Title: Trump Admin Throws Weight Behind Lawsuit Alleging Wall Street Embraced ESG To Shut Down Coal
URL: https://freebeacon.com/energy/trump-admin-wades-into-esg-case-accusing-wall-street-of-shutting-down-coal-jacking-up-electric-prices/
Time Published: 2025-05-22T15:52:02Z
Full Content:
The Federal Trade Commission is throwing its weight behind a high-profile federal lawsuit led by 12 Republican-led states accusing three of the world's largest asset managers—BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard—of artificially constricting the coal market in violation of U.S. antitrust laws, the Washington Free Beacon has learned. The filing in the case is a remarkable move that represents the first time the Trump administration has waded directly into an issue or case related to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) policies. Led by powerful asset managers and banks, the ESG movement broadly calls for investors to pull money away from traditional energy industries, like coal and oil, and divert it to green energy industries in the fight against global warming. "Competition in coal markets incentivizes companies to produce as much coal as the market demands," the FTC stated in its Thursday brief. "Allowing the marketplace to freely determine the intersection of supply and demand is thus critical to America’s energy security and economic dynamism." "This case is about alleged anticompetitive conduct that increased energy prices for ordinary American consumers and businesses," it continued. The case dates back to November when Texas attorney general Ken Paxton filed a complaint alongside 11 other states, accusing defendants of violating century-old antitrust laws by collectively acquiring substantial ownership stakes in every major coal company in the country before using their newfound influence to pressure the industry to adopt climate goals like cutting coal output in half by 2030. Paxton said those actions have contributed to rising electricity prices. Coal-fired power currently generates less than 15 percent of the nation's total electricity, down from the 33 percent it generated a decade ago, according to federal data. In that same time period, the average price of electricity has steadily increased. In its brief Thursday, filed in the District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, the FTC made clear its interest in protecting Americans from anticompetitive behavior that "reduces the production of domestic energy, raises energy prices for consumers and businesses, and undermines America’s energy dominance." The brief clarified that antitrust laws allow for passive fund investing and that the federal government does not intend to argue otherwise. The case, however, is about the coordinated use of the power to distort output and prices in energy markets, the commission wrote. Paxton's complaint alleged that BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard ultimately deceived thousands of investors "who elected to invest in non-ESG funds to maximize their profits" but whose money was used to pursue ESG strategies. "The President has declared a national energy emergency, and we need competition in coal production now more than ever to help fuel American energy dominance," Abigail Slater, the assistant attorney general for the Justice Department’s antitrust division, said in a statement. "American consumers suffer when institutional asset managers use shareholdings in competing companies to orchestrate output reductions." Texas's complaint accuses defendants of violating the Sherman Act and Clayton Act. Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, West Virginia, and Wyoming joined as plaintiffs. "This is great news for the case and for the country because it helps validate the arguments that Ken Paxton's office and the other states have been making," Will Hild, the executive director of watchdog group Consumers Research and a prominent critic of ESG policies, said in an interview. "What I really hope to see coming out of this is these companies acknowledging that they messed up and figuring out how they're going to make it right for American consumers in these states and then promising never to do it again," he continued. "But I think the pressure is really building in a monumental way." State Street did not immediately respond to request for comment. "The DOJ and FTC’s support for this baseless case undermines the Trump administration’s goal of American energy independence," a BlackRock spokesman said in a statement. "As we made clear in our earlier motion to dismiss, this case is trying to re-write antitrust law and is based on an absurd theory that coal companies conspired with their shareholders to reduce coal production. Forcing asset managers to divest from coal companies will harm their ability to access capital and invest in their businesses and employees, likely leading to higher energy prices." "The underlying lawsuit contorts the law in a way that will hurt individual investors, and Vanguard will continue to defend our long history of safeguarding and promoting long-term investment returns on behalf of Vanguard-advised funds and their investors," added a Vanguard spokesman. The court is expected to rule on the defendants' motion to dismiss in the coming weeks. A hearing on the motion is slated for early June. Critics of the ESG movement say it seeks to improperly boost politically favored green industries that aren't profitable at the expense of more profitable energy industries. In doing so, they argue, ESG policies harm American investors—asset managers that have a legally mandated fiduciary duty to promote the wellbeing of clients whose money they manage. Citing those arguments, several GOP states like Texas and lawmakers have taken action to block ESG policies nationwide. "Woke corporations are collectively adopting and imposing progressive policy goals that American consumers do not want or do not need," Rep. Jim Jordan (R., Ohio), the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said in 2022 after he launched a sweeping antitrust investigation into Wall Street over ESG. ESG efforts proliferated on Wall Street in recent years, with major financial institutions, including the defendants in Texas's case, joining large net zero coalitions designed to marshal initiatives pushing public companies to reduce their carbon emissions. And the Biden administration itself introduced ESG-related policies at the Securities and Exchange Commission and Department of Labor. President Donald Trump's electoral victory, however, dealt a crippling blow to the ESG movement and, as a result, Wall Street largely backtracked from its previous efforts. For example, the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, a high-profile international coalition whose membership included some of the world's largest banks, suspended operations in January after BlackRock withdrew for unspecified legal reasons. Texas referenced the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative in its November lawsuit, alleging that it was used by defendants to push their ESG objectives.

May 22, 2025 – Singapore, Singapore Mantle, the largest sustainable hub for on-chain finance with over $3 billion in TVL (total value locked), today announced a strategic partnership with Republic Technologies, the Ethereum (ETH) treasury of publicly listed Canadian company Beyond Medical Technologies Inc. (CSE: DOCT) (IBKR: DOCT) (FSE: 7FM). This partnership marks a major milestone in institutional cryptocurrency adoption, positioning Mantle’s mETH as the first liquid staking token to be held on the balance sheet of a publicly listed company. Through the partnership, Republic Technologies plans to delegate a significant portion of its ETH holdings to Mantle’s mETH Protocol and will hold mETH as a yield-bearing, liquid staking token on its balance sheet. The collaboration underscores a structural shift in institutional digital asset strategy and growing investor conviction in Ethereum-native yield infrastructure, reflecting Republic Technologies’ deepening alignment with the Mantle ecosystem. Republic Technologies is establishing a new institutional paradigm by building a treasury strategy around Ethereum, seen as the foundational layer for smart contracts, tokenization and decentralized financial settlement. In contrast to Bitcoin-focused strategies employed by firms like Strategy and Metaplanet, whose reserves are largely Bitcoin-based, Republic Technologies’ approach is anchored in Ethereum’s role as the infrastructure layer powering both blockchain innovation and real-world enterprise integration. By accumulating ETH as a core balance sheet asset, Republic Technologies advances the growth of its underlying healthcare technology businesses while offering institutional-grade exposure to digital assets for all shareholders. This strategy attracts growing interest from traditional markets and accelerates institutional participation in the emerging technology sector. Daniel Liu, CEO of Republic Technologies, said, “We hold strong conviction that Ethereum is the institutional chain, with ETH serving as the digital fuel powering global financial systems. “Our initial entry through Mantle’s Scout program helped us gain early exposure to the broader Mantle ecosystem, where our alignment with mETH Protocol came as a natural next step. “More than 50 established incumbents – including BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, PayPal and Visa – have already built services on Ethereum. Wall Street has made its decision. “Our role now is to extend the benefits of this macro tailwind to a broader base of institutional and retail participants worldwide.” Its leadership team brings decades of experience from top-tier financial institutions, including Apollo Global Management, Goldman Sachs, BlackRock and Canaccord Genuity. Republic Technologies operates under the publicly listed company Beyond Medical Technologies Inc., a technology firm integrating blockchain infrastructure to drive operational efficiency and improve patient outcomes across the medical ecosystem. In March 2025, Republic Technologies entered into a licensing agreement and launched its medical attestation platform, leveraging Ethereum-based distributed systems to power healthcare data integrity and regulatory compliance. The Ethereum treasury was established to support and scale this vision, marking a first-of-its-kind integration. Mantle’s mETH Protocol has quickly emerged as one of the leading platforms in Ethereum liquid staking and restaking. Within just 66 days of launch, it surpassed $1 billion in TVL – the fastest growth in its category – and has since peaked at over $2.19 billion. Designed with institutional-grade capital efficiency and composability in mind, mETH enables institutions to access Ethereum-native yield through a fully composable and capital-efficient framework. To date, over 170,000 mETH (approximately $455 million) has been restaked into EigenDA, securing Mantle’s modular data availability layer. Validator operations are distributed across leading infrastructure providers, including Stakefish, P2P.org, Blockdaemon, A41 and Veda, ensuring high availability and robust institutional reliability. Jonathan Low, growth lead at mETH Protocol, said, “Republic Technologies’ participation highlights mETH Protocol’s ability to support institutional strategies built natively on Ethereum. “As demand accelerates for ETH-native yield and utility, we remain focused on building resilient infrastructure that long-term allocators can trust.” The partnership precedes mETH’s inclusion in MI4 (Mantle Index Four), a tokenized, yield-focused index fund developed in collaboration with Securitize – the tokenization firm behind BlackRock’s BUIDL and Apollo’s ACRED. Backed by up to $400 million anchor investment from the Mantle Treasury, MI4 targets $1 billion in AUM and will offer regulated exposure to BTC, ETH, SOL, stablecoins and select staking assets, with mETH playing a central role in its ETH allocation strategy. In parallel, Mantle is preparing to extend mETH’s utility across TradFi (traditional finance) through Mantle Banking, an initiative that will integrate mETH into fiat rails, credit products and conventional payment systems. This integration will allow users to spend, borrow and invest with mETH across traditional payment rails, unlocking real-world utility for digital assets. A pioneering on-chain ecosystem dedicated to revolutionizing the future of finance and blockchain scalability, seamlessly bridging TradFi and DeFi (decentralized finance). Through innovative products like Mantle Network, mETH Protocol, Function (FBTC) and MI4, Mantle’s ecosystem empowers users and institutions with a unified financial services platform, redefining how the world spends, saves and invests in the Web 3.0 era.

Title: Renowned Data Analyst Warns Excess Deaths Are Surging ‘Off the Charts’ . Started Exploding after the Covid mRNA “vaccines” Roll Out in Early 2021″

Time Published: 2025-05-22T13:49:45Z
Full Content:
World-renowned data analyst Ed Dowd has just dropped a chilling warning after uncovering evidence showing that the number of excess deaths of working-age Americans is skyrocketing. According to an alarming warning from Dowd, a leading Wall Street analyst, insurance industry data shows that excess deaths are soaring among people aged 18 to 64 years old. These deaths started exploding after the Covid mRNA “vaccines” were rolled out for public use in early 2021. However, the deaths appear to show no signs of slowing down, despite the pandemic being long over and vaccination rates dropping off. Dowd is a former executive at the world’s largest investment firm, BlackRock. He is considered one of America’s leading data experts. Through his expert analysis of insurance industry data, Dowd has become a prominent figure in investigations into the impact of the global Covid vaccination campaign. In January 2022, Life Insurance CEO Scott Davidson reported that death rates among working-aged people aged 18 to 64 were “up 40 percent over what they were pre-pandemic.” He explained that a 40 percent spike in deaths was completely unprecedented. Davidson compared a 10 percent rise in deaths to a once-in-200-year flood. According to Dowd, excess deaths are now “off the charts.” Davidson also noted that excess deaths that started surging in 2021 were non-Covid deaths. Speaking about the alarming spike, pathologist Dr. Ryan Cole said: “The majority of those deaths happened in quarters number three and four of… 2021. “What does that mean? “When did the mandate start? “Quarter number three and four, 2021.” Although the soaring deaths identified by Dowd are deeply concerning, they don’t show the whole picture, as the data only reveals figures related to working-age individuals with insurance policies. However, Dowd has previously identified major spikes in other age groups using different data sets. In December, Dowd issued a red alert after uncovering evidence that reveals excess deaths are continuing to skyrocket in children who received Covid mRNA “vaccines.” According to Dowd’s findings, excess child deaths are still accelerating and show no sign of slowing down. Dowd made the discovery while analyzing the official data from the UK government’s Office for National Statistics (ONS). “The UK has a problem,” Dowd warned during an interview on “The Jimmy Dore Show.” However, while the deaths were identified in UK data, the trend is most likely reflected in other nations with a similar mass vaccination protocol, including the United States, Canada, Australia, and much of Europe. Dowd’s data shows that excess deaths for children aged one to fourteen have surged higher each year since the Covid mRNA “vaccines” were rolled out in 2021. According to Dowd, excess deaths for children in this age group spiked by a staggering 22% in 2023 – the last full year of data available at the time. Dowd notes that this trend didn’t start until “the magic juice started to be issued to children later in 2021.” The data shows that deaths were actually lower than expected in 2020 but started surging in 2021. According to Dowd’s findings, each year’s data shows: As Dowd notes, while the “vaccines” were rolled out for public use in early 2021, they were authorized for children later in the year. Although the data for last year wasn’t complete at the time of his analysis, Dowd revealed that the available official figures showed that the surging death trend continued through 2024. “Figures from the Office for National Statistics show about 10% more deaths (across all age groups) than expected since April [2024],” Dowd adds. Yet, despite the clear correlation with the mass vaccination campaign, UK health officials insist that “circulatory diseases and diabetes are … behind the increase.” * Click the share button below to email/forward this article.

He provides a comprehensive analysis of everything you need to know about the “pandemic” — from the medical dimensions to the economic and social repercussions, political underpinnings, and mental and psychological impacts. “My objective as an author is to inform people worldwide and refute the official narrative which has been used as a justification to destabilize the economic and social fabric of entire countries, followed by the imposition of the “deadly” COVID-19 “vaccine”. This crisis affects humanity in its entirety: almost 8 billion people. We stand in solidarity with our fellow human beings and our children worldwide. Truth is a powerful instrument.” Reviews This is an in-depth resource of great interest if it is the wider perspective you are motivated to understand a little better, the author is very knowledgeable about geopolitics and this comes out in the way Covid is contextualized. —Dr. Mike Yeadon In this war against humanity in which we find ourselves, in this singular, irregular and massive assault against liberty and the goodness of people, Chossudovsky’s book is a rock upon which to sustain our fight. –Dr. Emanuel Garcia In fifteen concise science-based chapters, Michel traces the false covid pandemic, explaining how a PCR test, producing up to 97% proven false positives, combined with a relentless 24/7 fear campaign, was able to create a worldwide panic-laden “plandemic”; that this plandemic would never have been possible without the infamous DNA-modifying Polymerase Chain Reaction test – which to this day is being pushed on a majority of innocent people who have no clue. His conclusions are evidenced by renown scientists. —Peter Koenig Professor Chossudovsky exposes the truth that “there is no causal relationship between the virus and economic variables.” In other words, it was not COVID-19 but, rather, the deliberate implementation of the illogical, scientifically baseless lockdowns that caused the shutdown of the global economy. –David Skripac A reading of Chossudovsky’s book provides a comprehensive lesson in how there is a global coup d’état under way called “The Great Reset” that if not resisted and defeated by freedom loving people everywhere will result in a dystopian future not yet imagined.

Title: R3 connects to Solana

R3 and Solana Foundation today announce a strategic collaboration to bring regulated financial institutions and their real-world assets onto Solana. 0 22 May 2025 Be the first to comment This content is provided by an external author without editing by Finextra. It expresses the views and opinions of the author. It will deliver the first enterprise-grade, permissioned consensus service offered to the public directly on a Layer 1 network. This brings the institutional TradFi and DeFi worlds into true convergence, marrying the unparalleled reach of R3 into the TradFi ecosystem with the scale, liquidity, and innovation of internet capital markets. As the world’s most used public blockchain, the Solana blockchain offers unmatched performance, low fees, and a vibrant global ecosystem - making it the ideal foundation for the next generation of regulated digital finance.R3 has invited Lily Liu, President of the Solana Foundation, to R3’s Board of Directors, marking a strategic shift for R3 that unites the strengths of public and permissioned blockchains.Solana and R3 will bring regulated assets onto a public blockchain at a time when the RWA sector is at a pivotal juncture: regulatory tailwinds are spurring investor confidence in digital assets, financial institutions are becoming increasingly comfortable with leveraging public networks, and the DeFi sector is maturing. These forces are driving growing demand for high-quality, tokenized assets on public networks.As the world's largest collection of permissioned RWA networks, with over $10 billion in regulated assets on-chain across its platforms, the R3 ecosystem is ideally positioned to meet this demand. R3’s Corda has the most live, in-production use cases and millions of transactions processed daily by leading institutional players. Integrating with Solana’s blockchain will enable these assets to flow to meet the growing demand on public networks, and unlock new settlement options across these ecosystems, including using high-quality stablecoins. Unlike traditional interoperability approaches, this comprehensive integration means private transactions on Corda can be confirmed directly on Solana mainnet, inheriting the network's performance and security, and enabling true transactional atomicity.The collaboration will create a consensus service deployed on Solana to enable native interoperability between R3’s existing Corda platform - as well as other private networks - and Solana, bridging the gap between permissioned and public blockchain ecosystems for the first time. This will enable regulated financial institutions - including banks, financial market infrastructure providers, and asset managers - to fully harness the openness and efficiency of Solana without re-writing their applications or compromising on compliance, security, or asset control.R3 chose Solana as its public Layer-1 substrate and the basis for its new consensus service following an extensive evaluation and technical review of decentralized protocols, selecting Solana for its low transaction fees, speed, scalability, as well as the Solana ecosystem’s robust developer community, and relationships with numerous regulated financial institutions, including Blackrock, Franklin Templeton, and Hamilton Lane which have all deployed regulated assets on the network.Critically, this collaboration simplifies the complexity of managing RWAs on public blockchains - bringing Corda’s proven strengths in identity, privacy, and compliance to a public and permissioned environment. This allows traditional financial institutions to operate with the same control and clarity they expect from enterprise-grade infrastructure, while unlocking the scale and flexibility of a public network. “This is a major step forward for the institutional adoption of public blockchain," said Lily Liu, President of the Solana Foundation. "R3’s decision to bring its regulated financial network onto Solana is powerful validation that public blockchains have reached institutional readiness. With Solana's unmatched performance, enterprise-grade permissioning, and growing roster of regulated assets, we're not just witnessing convergence between TradFi and DeFi - we're enabling it. This collaboration signifies that the future of capital markets will be built on public infrastructure. We’re thrilled that the Solana ecosystem is leading the way."David E. Rutter, Founder and CEO of R3 commented: “We’ve never pursued blockchain for its own sake - our mission is to solve real financial problems. After years of laying the groundwork, R3 is ready to bring our experience and our network of regulated financial institutions towards a new public future with one of the best and most trusted public ecosystems - Solana. This is more than a milestone; it’s a strategic realignment for the entire industry. We know DeFi isn’t coming to TradFi, so it’s up to us to build the connective infrastructure that links these two ecosystems. This is about adapting to deliver real-world utility, institutional-grade readiness, and shaping the long-term future of regulated markets.”Clearstream, a leading post-trade infrastructure provider at the forefront of digitizing financial markets, is a long-standing user of R3’s Corda which underpins its digital collateral solution. Jens Hachmeister, Head of Issuer Services & New Digital Markets at Clearstream, commented: “Tokenization isn’t just about digitizing assets - it’s about building scalable, global infrastructure where real-world assets can interact directly and securely, no matter where investors are located. The convergence of public and private blockchains is no longer a future promise - it’s happening now. This is a generational shift in how value moves, and a compelling moment for any institution looking to enter the crypto space. We’re excited for what’s ahead.”

Title: Ant International Helps HSBC Hong Kong Offer Tokenized Deposits

Time Published: 2025-05-22T12:28:17Z

Ant International has teamed with HSBC on the bank’s tokenized deposit service in Hong Kong. The service is designed to support treasury management via real-time, “always-on” Hong Kong and U.S. dollar payments between corporate wallets held by an HSBC Hong Kong client, according to a Thursday (May 22) press release. In addition, the service is also Hong Kong’s first bank-led, blockchain-based settlement service, and follows a pilot test between HSBC and Ant International on Ant’s Whale platform. “We are very excited to work with an industry leader like HSBC, who shares the belief that tokenisation is the key to bridging the stability of traditional banking with the efficiency of blockchain, to enable real-time treasury management,” Kelvin Li, general manager of platform tech at Ant International, said in the release. “As a tech connector in the fast-evolving financial services industry, our banking partnerships are expanding from tokenization to AI-driven global FX and liquidity initiatives. We look forward to working with more public and private-sector partners to unlock more transparent, accessible and efficient treasury management solutions for businesses worldwide.” The partnership is happening at a moment when, as covered here last month, money and assets are experiencing a transformation thanks to tokenization on the blockchain. “On-chain tokenization is moving from concept to practice, with players like Visa, Mastercard, J.P. Morgan, and other commercial banks exploring or piloting real-world tokenized payment and financial systems,” PYMNTS wrote. “For chief financial officers and corporate treasurers, tokenization isn’t just a tech issue; it could represent a capital strategy shift.” BlackRock CEO Larry Fink also wants all assets to be tokenized and tradable online, telling shareholders: “Every stock, every bond, every fund — every asset — can be tokenized.” At its most basic level, tokenization refers to representing real-world assets like fiat currency, securities and investment contracts as digital tokens on a distributed ledger. From there, these tokens can be transferred, programmed, or settled in ways traditional systems don’t allow. Tokenization “isn’t a cryptocurrency play,” that report added, but rather a way for businesses and financial services stakeholders to move value faster, cheaper, and more securely across networks. It’s also a way to modernize money movement while democratizing investment access to institutional-grade products. “Banks are in the state where they are thinking about blockchains as public infrastructure that they need to rely on,” Chainalysis Co-founder and CEO Jonathan Levin told PYMNTS. “Back in 2014 … cryptocurrency only meant blockchains that had native cryptocurrency tokens. Today, people are putting all types of financial instruments on the blockchain.” This Week in AI: The Agentic Web, AI-Native Devices and Search Tools Trump Threatens to Raise Tariffs on Apple and European Union The Digital Asset Primer: Why Equity Markets Are Being Tokenized Report: SBA Staffing Cuts Reduce Service to Entrepreneurs We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

Title: BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF Hits 2-Week High as $BTC Nears $112K. BTC Bull Token to Follow?

Time Published: 2025-05-22T12:06:54Z

BlackRock ETFs have experienced a two-week high while Bitcoin is pushing to its first-ever $112K price mark. Projects like BTC Bull Token could rally next. Farside Investors published the numbers, showing that IBIT’s net inflows peaked at $530.6M, the highest since May 5th $531.2M. The ETF tracking Trader T also highlighted BlackRock’s record Bitcoin intake, as it peaked at 4,931 $BTC, the highest volume since January 23. According to Bloomberg ETF analyst, Eric Balchunas: ‘Classic feeding frenzy in effect, new ATHs will do that,’ referring to Bitcoin’s recent performance, which is nothing short of inspirational. What does this mean and, perhaps more importantly, how can you leverage this bull run through BTC Bull Token, which promises free Bitcoin? Let’s dig in! The BlackRock ETF rally tells a larger story—that of Bitcoin’s record-breaking rally, sprinkled with modest swings, but overall very bullish. $BTC hit its peak at $111,746 on May 22 at 7:00AM and, while it lost $1K in the meantime, it doesn’t seem that the bull run is anywhere near over. Titan of Crypto’s X prediction of a $135K $BTC for 2025 is more than reasonable, given the recent Bitcoin adoption trend among public and private institutions. However, it turns out that Titan’s $135K prediction is among the tamest ones, as technical analyst Gert van Lagen envisions a $320K Bitcoin by the end of 2025. Peter Brandt, veteran Bitcoin trader, shares Lagen’s optimism, stating: I think it is wonderful Bitcoin is making ATHs. I am long. […] On track maybe for top of $125,000 to $150,000 by the end of August? —Peter Brandt, X That being said, despite Bitcoin’s 30-day pump of 25%, investors should still show caution and patience, according to Joao Wedson, CEO of Alphractal: Public obsession with breaking the ATH matters more than risk management — setting the stage for traps targeting both bulls and bears. —Joao Wedson, X Caution or not, though, you should know that Bitcoin’s steroid-fueled chart run is bound to rally some of the best altcoins on the market today. One such altcoin is BTC Bull Token, one of the most promising meme coins in 2025. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) is a meme project that fuels its run by offering you free $BTC airdrops, so long as you hold your $BTCBULL tokens in Best Wallet. The project was born from the idea that Bitcoin is an unstoppable force that will eventually breach the $1M price ceiling. Following the same line of thought, a $250K price point for 2025 isn’t out of the question either. The presale is understandably pumping, with over $6.1M raised since inception and a token price of $0.002525. According to the same projection, you should expect a more modest ROI of 160% by the end of 2025, if the $0.006467 prediction comes true. In this context, the airdrops are the cherry on top, as the project will reward holders with real $BTC every time Bitcoin breaches through predetermined price points ($150K and $200K) With such a low token price and the fact that the project is still in presale, BTC Bull Token appears to be a good investment opportunity, especially in a market where even Ethereum is witnessing consistent gains. If you decide to catch this bull by the horns, check out our ‘how to buy $BTCBULL’ guide today to streamline the acquisition process. We’ve no reason to think the Bitcoin bull is coming out of the china shop yet. It’s definitely resting, though, as Bitcoin appears to consolidate its position around $110,700-ish. But given the avalanche of Bitcoin-endorsing policies coming from the White House in Q1 2025 and the mass adoption over the last year, it’s safe to say that 2025 will be Bitcoin’s time to shine. So, don’t get blindsided by the King coin’s break, and don’t ignore potential honeypots like the BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL).

Readers should conduct independent research before taking any actions related to the project mentioned in this piece. This article should not be regarded as investment advice. Mantle, a pioneering on-chain ecosystem revolutionizing the DeFi space, has partnered strategically with Republic Technologies, the Ethereum (“ETH”) treasury of publicly listed Canadian company Beyond Medical Technologies Inc. According to an official announcement today, the partnership will see Republic Technologies integrating Mantle’s mETH Protocol to foster Defi innovation. Following this partnership, Mantle’s mETH will become the first liquid staking token to be held on the balance sheet of a publicly listed company, marking a major milestone in institutional cryptocurrency adoption. Nonetheless, Republic Technologies has disclosed plans to delegate a significant portion of its ETH holdings to Mantle’s mETH Protocol and will hold mETH as a yield-bearing, liquid staking token on its balance sheet. While this move highlights growing investor conviction in Ethereum-native yield infrastructure, it reflects Republic Technologies’ deepening alignment with the Mantle ecosystem. With this partnership, Republic Technologies seeks to establish a new institutional paradigm by building a treasury strategy around Ethereum, which is seen as the foundational layer for smart contracts, tokenization, and decentralized financial settlement. Per the announcement, Republic Technologies adopts an approach anchored in Ethereum’s role as the infrastructure layer powering blockchain innovation and real-world enterprise integration. This is unlike Bitcoin-focused strategies employed by firms like Strategy and Metaplanet, whose reserves are largely Bitcoin-based. As such, Republic Technologies will be accumulating ETH as its core balance sheet asset, advancing the growth of its underlying healthcare technology businesses while offering institutional-grade exposure to digital assets for all shareholders. Daniel Liu, the CEO of Republic Technologies, commented on this,s saying; “We hold strong conviction that Ethereum is the institutional chain, with ETH serving as the digital fuel powering global financial systems…Our initial entry through Mantle’s Scout Program helped us gain early exposure to the broader Mantle ecosystem, where our alignment with mETH Protocol came as a natural next step.” “More than 50 established incumbents—including BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, PayPal, and Visa—have already built services on Ethereum. Wall Street has made its decision. Our role now is to extend the benefits of this macro tailwind to a broader base of institutional and retail participants worldwide,” Liu added. The firm’s decision to establish an Ethereum treasury has fueled its decision to integrate Mantle’s mETH Protocol. This DeFi platform has quickly emerged as one of the leading platforms in Ethereum liquid staking and restaking. Designed with institutional-grade capital efficiency and composability in mind, mETH enables institutions to access Ethereum-native yield through a fully composable and capital-efficient framework. Jonathan Low, the Growth Lead at mETH Protocol has also commented on the partnership saying; “Republic Technologies’ participation highlights mETH Protocol’s ability to support institutional strategies built natively on Ethereum…As demand accelerates for ETH-native yield and utility, we remain focused on building resilient infrastructure that long-term allocators can trust.” Following efforts to boost mETH’s adoption while offering users the opportunity to spend, borrow, and invest with mETH across traditional payment rails, Mantle is making plans to extend mETH’s utility across traditional finance through Mantle Banking. This initiative seeks to integrate mETH into fiat rails, credit products, and conventional payment systems.

Title: Ethereum staking hits record high, ETF inflows turn bullish – Impact on market?
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/ethereum-staking-hits-record-high-etf-inflows-turn-bullish-impact-on-market/
Time Published: 2025-05-22T08:30:41Z
Full Content:
The return of positive ETF inflows and rise in depositing addresses for staking could pave way for a better environment of Ethereum products. Ethereum [ETH] ETFs produced a combined $64.8o million in net flows on the 20th of May 2025. This pointed to an extra religion from essential institutions and influential individuals known as ‘smart money’ who seemed to be positioning themselves. BlackRock’s ETHA fund led with a $45.0 million raise, while Fidelity’s FETH secured $19.8 million. Meanwhile, there were no net flow changes for Bitwise (ETHW), 21Shares (CETH), VanEck (ETHV), Invesco (QETH), Franklin (EZET), or Grayscale’s funds (ETHE and ETH). These inflows follow a period of mixed or lower flows, following the—$39.8 million outflow on the 15th of May, primarily from Grayscale and Fidelity. Source: X On the 20th of May, major institutions like BlackRock and Fidelity made significant purchases, contributing $152.9 million in inflows and $15.2 million in outflows since the 8th of May. Their actions suggest an attempt to position themselves ahead of potential price increases or key market triggers. If this trend continues, it could further solidify the bullish structure for ETH’s price soon. The sudden surge in new capital indicates a notable shift in how high-conviction investors allocate their resources. Moreover, there were now more than 225,000 depositor addresses taking part in Ethereum’s staking contract—a record high. The change climbed by 0.30% over the past week, 1.77% in the past month, and 5.76% in the previous three months. It appeared more consumers were joining the Ethereum staking feature, with steady rates starting from mid-2023. Although the market was volatile, the strong growth of staked ETH demonstrated that more people were joining the network. With the total staked ETH standing at 34,559,715, this growth highlighted rising network participation despite market volatility. As the conversation about ETH ETF staking accelerated, the rise in unique staking addresses indicated that more validators were now participating. Source: IntoTheBlock Though it did not connect to institutions, it showed that ETH was still in high demand as an asset providing high yields. Although these numbers could rise significantly more, regulatory approval was necessary for it to happen. ETH’s resilience could be key to its future price stability. BlackRock has continued to push for approval of ETH ETF staking, options, and tokenization, signaling growing investor interest in Ethereum’s products as the market recovers. The company’s discussions with the SEC Crypto Task Force could accelerate the creation of clearer cryptocurrency regulations. If ETH ETF staking is approved, large investors may shift toward Ethereum, boosting its adoption. In the long term, these developments could drive higher ETF inflows, especially as Ethereum leads efforts in tokenization and stablecoin infrastructure. However, the outcome ultimately depends on regulatory decisions and market response.

The ₹2,150-crore IPO is entirely a fresh issue by the company, with no offer-for-sale component. Against an offer size of about 17.71 crore shares, the IPO received bids for 11.82 crore shares, subscribing 0.67 times. The IPO will close on May 23. The price band for the offer has been pegged at ₹85-90 per share, and investors can bid for a minimum of 166 equity shares. The offer is being made through the book-building process, wherein not more than 50 per cent of the offer shall be available for allocation on a proportionate basis to qualified institutional buyers, not less than 15 per cent for allocation to non-institutional bidders, and up to 35 per cent of the offer to retail investors. While the quota for non-institutional investors, generally referred to as HNIs, was subscribed 1.44 times, the retail portion elicited 0.48 times subscription and the institutional quota 0.42 times. Ahead of the IPO, Belrise Industries on Tuesday garnered ₹645 crore from anchor investors. The company informed the bourses that it had allocated 71,666,665 shares at ₹90 per share to anchor investors. The investors who participated in the anchor book include foreign institutions such as BlackRock, Capital Group, M&G, and Pinebridge, and domestic institutions such as ICICI Prudential MF, HDFC MF, Nippon India MF, ValueQuest, and Bajaj Allianz Life. The proceeds from the fresh issue, to the extent of ₹1,618.13 crore, will be used for repayment or prepayment, in full or in part, of certain borrowings availed by the company, and for general corporate purposes. Belrise Industries Ltd (BIL) is an automotive component manufacturing company, offering a diverse range of safety critical systems and other engineering solutions for two-wheelers, three-wheelers, four-wheelers, commercial vehicles, and agri-vehicles. Its product portfolio includes metal chassis systems, polymer components, suspension systems, body-in-white components, and exhaust systems, among others. BIL’s products are largely agnostic to vehicle powertrain types, reflecting its ability in catering to both electric vehicles and internal combustion engine vehicles, thus positioning it favourably to adapt to the growing electric vehicle market. The company specialises in precision sheet metal pressing and fabrication (i.e., the process of joining sheet metal components to create unified structures for assembling vehicle subsystems and bodies), and had a market share of 24 per cent in the overall two-wheeler metal components segment in India as of March 31, 2024, in terms of revenue (Source: CRISIL Report). Belrise has a long-standing relationship with OEMs such as Bajaj Auto Limited, Honda Motorcycle & Scooter India Private Limited, Hero MotoCorp Limited, Jaguar Land Rover Limited, and Royal Enfield Motors Limited, among others. Belrise Industries’ revenue from operations increased by 13.70 per cent to ₹7,484.24 crore for the financial year 2024, from ₹6,582.50 crore for the financial year 2023, primarily attributable to an increase in product sales and higher prices of raw materials and components. Profit after tax for FY24 stood at ₹310.88 crore. For the nine months ended December 31, 2024, revenue from operations stood at ₹6,013.43 crore, and profit after tax stood at ₹245.47 crore. Axis Capital Limited, Jefferies India Private Limited, HSBC Securities and Capital Markets (India) Private Limited, and SBI Capital Markets Limited are the book-running lead managers, while MUFG Intime India Private Limited is the registrar to the issue.

The rebound is buoyed by renewed risk appetite from investors as President Trump has toned down his trade war rhetoric, seeking deals with trading partners after slapping them with sizable tariffs. Still, Bitcoin has more room to run, according to the experts—with some industry observers predicting a $200,000 top. Others are predicting even higher jumps, whether they're expected later this year or beyond. Here’s a look at some of the massive targets that crypto experts have placed on Bitcoin lately. Adam Back, Blockstream CEO: $500,000 to $1 million this cycle Blockstream boss and Bitcoin legend Adam Back spoke to Decrypt last week, and predicted the biggest and oldest digital coin would hit $500,000 to $1 million this cycle. In an interview, the computer scientist said that the price of BTC was surprisingly low at this point after last year’s halving, considering all the institutional money involved. "I think if you get a new all-time high, it could quickly become a lot higher,” he said. Standard Chartered: $200,000 this year British bank Standard Chartered’s digital assets research team is bullish, to say the least. The bank’s Global Head of Digital Assets Research Geoffrey Kendrick has repeatedly said that the virtual coin would soar this year—despite Trump tariffs and other geopolitical factors—and is predicting a $200,000 high by the end of 2025. His reasoning? U.S.-based investors wanting a non-sovereign asset. "We expect a strategic asset reallocation away from U.S. assets to trigger the next sharp upswing in Bitcoin in the coming months," he said in April. Even more bullish is the analyst's outlook for the next few years: $500,000 per coin by the time President Trump leaves office at the start of 2029. Bernstein: $200,000 this bull run Investment firm Bernstein has also bet on Bitcoin's price hitting new highs, with analysts at the firm regularly saying that institutional money will be the main driver. The firm expects companies to snap up $330 billion in Bitcoin over the next five years. "The Bitcoin genie is out of the bottle, and it is hard to reverse this course," Bernstein analysts said last year before crypto-friendly President Trump won the U.S. election. Bernstein analysts in 2024 and this year have forecast that BTC's price will end 2025 at $200,000. Arthur Hayes: $150,000 in 2025 Billionaire entrepreneur Arthur Hayes is known for his outlandish predictions—even once referring to long-term forecasts as "pretty shit." Still, the former BitMEX boss knows his macro and has predicted intense central bank money printing to push BTC's price to the moon. Similar to Standard Chartered, he thinks investors will want to leave American assets behind. "Bitcoin is the perfect and only lifeboat for global capital that must leave America and elsewhere," he wrote in a recent blog post, predicting a $150,000 high this year. Tim Draper: $250,000 this year Billionaire investor Tim Draper recently went as far as to say that companies that didn't hold BTC on their balance sheets were being "irresponsible." The Silicon Valley venture capital investor and founder of Draper Associates said earlier this month that by the end of 2025, he believes Bitcoin will hit $250,000, noting a "gravitational pull toward Bitcoin." BlackRock's Larry Fink: $700,000… eventually BlackRock boss Larry Fink, who has massively helped institutions get involved in buying BTC with the launch of the popular iShares Bitcoin Trust, said that the coin could hit $700,000. Speaking in January at the World Economic Forum in Davos, the CEO of the world's largest asset manager said that if institutions like sovereign wealth funds continued to make even small allocations to the asset, the orange coin's price would rocket upwards. But the Wall Street titan did add that he wasn't promoting the cryptocurrency with his bullish bet. Brian Armstrong: Multi-millions… at some point The CEO of America's biggest crypto exchange Coinbase forecast in January that Bitcoin will be worth "multiple millions”—at some point in the future. Brian Armstrong, who founded the San Francisco, California-based exchange in 2012, said that nation-state adoption would help propel the asset that high. "I think over time we'll see Bitcoin get into the multiple millions price range," he said. Still, Armstrong, whose firm has contracts with the U.S. government, added that BTC has a long way to go before rising that high.

Title: Mike Novogratz Says Weakening Dollar, Widening Deficit and America’s Deteriorating Financial Situation ‘Very Good’ for Bitcoin and Crypto

The chief executive of crypto asset manager Galaxy Digital says America’s current financial situation is bullish for Bitcoin (BTC) and crypto. In a new interview with Bloomberg, Novogratz says that many factors have contributed to the rise of digital assets, including President Donald Trump and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink’s embrace of the sector. “It started with Larry Fink. When he got orange-pilled, the largest asset manager in the world said ‘this is a real asset,’ at least Bitcoin, that everyone should be a part of and lots of other companies… followed suit. And that was kind of round one of institutions coming in. But really it was the shift of approach from the Gary Gensler SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) to this Trump Administration which has just embraced our industry, and that freed up the animal spirit, both here and abroad.” However, Novogratz goes on to say that America’s current uncertain fiscal situation is ultimately good for the top crypto asset by market cap and the digital assets industry in general. He says the Trump administration’s failure to significantly lower the debt-to-GDP ratio has been a boon for the asset class. “We’re in a really hard position as a country… We have this kind of debt, yield curves are selling off everywhere, the dollar is under pressure, and that all is very good for Bitcoin and crypto assets as well.” BTC is trading for $108,961 at time of writing, just below a new all-time high.

As hedge funds trimmed their Magnificent Seven positions in the first quarter, they increasingly turned their attention toward some other stocks. In Goldman Sachs' Hedge Fund Trend Monitor published May 20, the firm highlighted 20 stocks that an increasing number of hedge funds added to their holdings in that period. That heightened interest could be a sign that the stocks are primed for strong returns in the months ahead, the bank said. "Historically, stocks with the largest increase in the number of hedge fund investors ('Rising Stars') have typically gone on to outperform sector peers during the quarters following their rise in popularity," said the note, authored by a team of strategists led by Ben Snider, a managing director. The utilities, financials, and consumer discretionary sectors each had five stocks on the list. Two have AI exposure: Sempra and Kinder Morgan. The average market cap of the 20 stocks on the list is $17 billion. We've listed the stocks below, along with their net gain in the number of funds that own them.

Title: Bitcoin ownership surpasses gold in the US as 50M Americans hold BTC
URL: https://coinjournal.net/news/bitcoin-ownership-surpasses-gold-in-the-us-as-50m-americans-hold-btc/
Time Published: 2025-05-21T15:13:56Z
Full Content:
Bitcoin has officially outpaced gold in US ownership, marking a significant pivot in the country’s investment landscape. According to a new report released on 20 May by Bitcoin investment firm River, roughly 50 million Americans now own Bitcoin, compared to 37 million who own gold. This data underscores the rise of Bitcoin as a preferred store of value, reshaping traditional notions of economic security and reserve asset status. As Bitcoin ownership expands, it’s increasingly seen not just as a speculative instrument, but as a fundamental part of US financial infrastructure. The River report notes that the United States is the global leader in Bitcoin adoption, with 40 percent of all Bitcoin-related companies headquartered in the country. American firms also hold 94.8 percent of all Bitcoin owned by publicly traded companies worldwide, reflecting significant institutional backing. This dominance is supported by a robust ecosystem comprising crypto-focused startups, spot ETF launches, and policies promoting digital asset development. Regulatory momentum in Washington has further strengthened Bitcoin’s foundation in the financial system. Recent discussions around treating Bitcoin as a potential strategic reserve asset suggest growing political acceptance. Several politicians have floated the idea of the US government maintaining a Bitcoin reserve, signalling institutional confidence amid rising concerns over the US dollar’s long-term stability. The shift toward Bitcoin is occurring alongside broader macroeconomic concerns. Moody’s recent downgrade of the US credit rating—ending over a century of top-tier ratings—has reinforced the appeal of decentralised alternatives. Investors increasingly view Bitcoin as a hedge against fiscal instability and inflation, particularly given its fixed supply and decentralised governance model. Bitcoin also offers practical advantages over gold in the digital age. The ease of storage, cross-border transfer, and liquidity make it an attractive option for both individual and institutional investors. This is particularly relevant in an era where digital finance is becoming the norm and where traditional safe-haven assets like gold face logistical and accessibility limitations. While Bitcoin is gaining legitimacy as a reserve asset, it remains a volatile asset class. Unlike gold, which has maintained relatively steady valuations over time, Bitcoin has experienced frequent price swings—something that may deter more risk-averse investors. Nonetheless, the market appears to be increasingly tolerant of this volatility, especially as long-term returns continue to outperform traditional assets. Institutional support also plays a key role in this shift. Major asset managers such as BlackRock are incorporating Bitcoin into their portfolios, further validating its status. Meanwhile, crypto ETFs and custodial services are helping to bridge the gap between traditional finance and the digital asset space, making it easier for Americans to gain exposure to Bitcoin without navigating complex self-custody solutions. As Bitcoin ownership grows, it reflects not just a shift in preference, but a broader transformation in how Americans perceive financial security and resilience. The trend is still developing, but the numbers now place Bitcoin squarely ahead of gold—at least in terms of how many Americans are betting on it.

Title: Welcoming Jon Xu and Andrew Miklas as YC’s Newest General Partners

Time Published: 2025-05-21T15:00:00Z
Full Content:
by Garry Tan5/21/2025 Over the last few batches, visiting partners Jon Xu and Andrew Miklas have become two of the most trusted voices in the YC community. They were both founders in YC’s Summer 2010 batch, and now, 15 years and two industry-shaping companies later, they’re back in a new role: General Partners at YC. As visiting partners, Jon and Andrew have already made a big impact, working closely with hundreds of founders across multiple batches. Now, as full-time General Partners, they’ll play an even bigger role in selecting, advising, and supporting the companies we back. They bring deep technical experience, firsthand startup grit, and a strong track record of helping early-stage companies grow – all of which makes them a perfect fit for YC’s mission to help ambitious founders build enduring companies from the earliest stages. Jon is the co-founder and former CTO of FutureAdvisor (YC S10), one of the first robo-advisors to make quality investment management accessible to a broader consumer audience. After the company was acquired by BlackRock in 2015, Jon continued to lead product and engineering, building an enterprise-grade robo-advisor platform for large financial institutions. His background gives him unique expertise both in building high-trust consumer products and B2B platforms for regulated industries. Andrew co-founded PagerDuty (YC S10, NYSE:PD), which became the backbone of digital operations for thousands of businesses. As founding CTO, he designed the original product and its high-availability architecture, and scaled the engineering team to 70+ people. After PagerDuty, he became an early-stage investor at s28 Capital, supporting companies like Clerk, CaptivateIQ, and Teleport. Andrew brings deep experience in building resilient systems and scaling engineering teams from zero to impact. At YC, we’re always looking for ways to meet the needs of the most ambitious founders. Adding Jon and Andrew to our team strengthens our bench of technical leaders who’ve built durable companies – and who know what it takes to turn early-stage ideas into something world-changing. We’re lucky to have them, and our founders will be even luckier.

Title: Crypto’s Market Penetration Tipping Point

You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday. The digital assets market has transformed from a niche experiment into a global force reshaping finance, commerce, and technology. In May 2025, the global crypto market is valued at $3.05 trillion, growing at a pace on par with the internet boom in the 90s. Historical adoption curves for technologies like the internet and smartphones demonstrate that 10% penetration often marks a tipping point, after which growth accelerates exponentially due to network effects and mainstream acceptance. Digital assets are now on this trajectory, driven by rising user adoption, institutional investment and innovative use cases. After years of public uncertainty, a pivotal milestone may be achieved this year: cryptocurrency user penetration can surpass the critical 10% threshold, estimated to reach 11.02% globally in 2025 by Statista, up from 7.41% in 2024. The chart below compares the early user adoption curves of cryptocurrency and the internet. It highlights that crypto is growing at a significantly faster rate than the internet did in its early years. With crypto expected to cross the 10% threshold of adoption in 2025, it is important to note that the 10% mark is not arbitrary —- it’s a well-documented tipping point in technology diffusion, rooted in Everett Rogers’ diffusion of innovations theory. This model shows that adoption shifts from early adopters (13.5%) to the early majority (34%) at around 10–15% penetration, marking the transition from niche to mainstream. Crossing 10% market penetration triggers rapid growth as infrastructure, accessibility and social acceptance align. Two very recent examples of this are the smartphone and the internet. For cryptocurrencies, surpassing 10% penetration in 2025 would signal a similar inflection point, with network effects amplifying adoption — more users increase liquidity, merchant acceptance and developer activity, making crypto more practical for everyday transactions like payments and remittances. In the U.S., 28% of adults (approximately 65 million people) own cryptocurrencies in 2025, nearly doubling from 15% in 2021. Additionally, 14% of non-owners plan to enter the market this year, and 66% of current owners intend to buy more, reflecting significant momentum. Globally, two out of three American adults are familiar with digital assets, signaling a sharp departure from its earlier speculative reputation. These figures underscore the growing mainstream acceptance of digital assets, aligning with the post-10% adoption surge observed in other transformative technologies. Crypto’s economic impact spans remittances, cross-border trade, and financial inclusion, particularly in Africa and Asia, where it empowers the unbanked. Several factors are propelling crypto past the 10% threshold: Institutional and business involvement is accelerating digital assets’ mainstream integration. Major financial players like BlackRock and Fidelity are going all in on crypto services and have launched crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs), with 72 ETFs awaiting SEC approval in 2025. Businesses are adopting crypto payments to cut fees and reach global customers, particularly in retail and e-commerce. Examples include Burger King in Germany accepting bitcoin since 2019 and PayPal’s 2024 partnership with MoonPay for U.S. crypto purchases. Platforms like Coinbase Commerce and Triple-A, alongside partnerships like Ingenico and Crypto.com, enable merchants to accept crypto with local currency settlements, reducing volatility risks. DeFi activity has increased significantly in Sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America, and Eastern Europe. In Eastern Europe, DeFi accounted for over 33% of total crypto received, with the region placing third globally in year-over-year DeFi growth. Despite its momentum, digital assets face hurdles: Still, the trajectory is promising. Bullish sentiment and crypto-friendly regulators, coupled with ETF momentum and payment integrations, underscore this trajectory.

Title: World’s Largest Alternative Asset Manager Discloses Modest Stake In BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF In First-Ever Crypto Bet

Blackstone, which considers itself to be the “world’s largest alternative asset manager,” has dipped its toes into crypto, purchasing shares in BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). According to a May 20 filing, Blackstone bought just around $1.08 million worth of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT), despite boasting approximately $1.2 trillion in assets under management. Blackstone reported holding 23,094 shares of IBIT at the end of the fiscal quarter ending March 31. The IBIT shares were added to Blackstone’s Alternative Multi-Strategy Fund (BTMIX), which holds $2.63 billion worth of assets, as per Google Finance data. This is the first time the asset manager has disclosed investing in anything crypto-related. Despite IBIT’s outstanding performance, it appears that Blackstone is not yet ready to commit substantial capital to investing in the apex crypto. It’s worth mentioning that Blackstone has largely steered clear of crypto. Back in September 2019, Blackstone co-founder and CEO Stephen Schwarzman said he liked the blockchain technology but thought its use for money was “pretty odd.” “[I was] raised in a world where someone needs to control currencies,” he noted at the time. Schwarzman further admitted he wasn’t much of a fan of Bitcoin, citing difficulties understanding the technology. BlackRock’s IBIT has drawn in a net inflow of over $46 billion since it went live on Wall Street in January 2024, signaling institutions’ persistent confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term prospects. Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas noted in a recent post on X that BlackRock is now the second-biggest Bitcoin holder globally, trailing only the mysterious BTC inventor Satoshi Nakamoto. Balchunas believes the asset manager is poised to surpass Satoshi’s holdings by next summer. The pundit reckons that if the Bitcoin price climbs to $150,000 in the coming months, it could spark a “feeding frenzy” among financial advisors, which would help BlackRock attain this milestone even more quickly.

While the risk of a downside correction cannot be ruled out, particularly if negative sentiment returns to the equity markets, the likelihood of such a scenario remains relatively low in the short to medium term. Overall, bitcoin is positioning itself for another upward move in the near future.”

Meanwhile Hugh Dooley reports that three of Ireland’s regional airports are set to share nearly €8 million in government funding to fund capital development projects.

Title: US Ambassador to Israel: 'America is your friend—we stand with Israel against evil'
URL: https://www.israelnationalnews.com/news/408688
Time Published: 2025-05-20T20:10:15Z

In a defiant and impassioned address in Tel Aviv, US Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee declared that the alliance between Israel and the United States is not only unshaken—it’s indivisible. Speaking to an audience of Israel’s top economic leaders, Huckabee rejected any notion of drifting ties between the nations. Framing Iran as the common source of regional threats, he vowed unwavering US support for Israel. "To anyone who says that the paths of Israel and the US are going their separate ways, that there is a conflict between them or that they are moving away from each other, I say: that is not what is happening. The only thing that was separated in this part of the world was the Red Sea, when Moses parted it in two to allow the Israelites to pass. I came here today in the name of friendship and gratitude," declared the US Ambassador at a festive reception held in his honor by the Ministry of Finance and the Israel Securities Authority on Tuesday evening, in the presence of the heads of the economy. Huckabee added that he "prays that God will cross the Red Sea again and allow the kidnapped to return home." “I realize that as I stand here tonight there are enemies poised to do any and everything they can to destroy you, to take you down and to take your future and your hope away. But they won't be able to do it. On all sides, whether it's Hamas, Hezbollah or the Houthis. I've said several times this week, it doesn't matter who brings the plate of hate to Israel to try to destroy you. We know where the kitchen is. The kitchen from which all of these really deadly disease dishes come from is from Iran and you're standing up against this evil monster, who for 46 years has said they're going to destroy you. But then they say once they're finished with you, they come after us. You're the appetizer, we're the entrée. Americans need to understand that the reason it matters what you do is because how you handle this threat is how we will ultimately have to handle this threat. Your enemies are our enemies and I hope it's always true that your friends are our friends. I say this from the bottom of my heart, America is your friend. We're your partner. We will stand with you. We must. We can't afford to pay the alimony of the divorce. So I hope you like us; you're stuck with us and I hope Americans will always love you because we feel like we're stuck with you too. God bless you.” Huckabee emphasized that "we (the US and Israel) are partners, we are not just stakeholders cooperating to advance their own selfish interests. Israel is not just our business partner, we also benefit from Israel's economic strength." He also noted "the strength of the Israeli economy in the midst of war, against all the international pressure, and frankly, against the backdrop of international madness." Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich also addressed the strength of relations between the countries: "We believe that the coming period will be a new high in relations between Israel and the US: an economic partnership that will bring more investments and more cooperation, regional moves that will position Israel as a strategic center connecting the Middle East, Europe and Asia, and an ideological infrastructure of a connection between tradition and innovation and freedom." Smotrich noted that Huckabee is "not just an ambassador of a country but a true friend" of Israel. "The Israeli economy has stood a huge test and emerged from it stronger than ever," said Smotrich. "The Israeli shekel is stronger today than on the eve of the war. This is not just the result of market trends - it is an international expression of confidence in the strength of Israeli society, in our political stability, and in the economic policy we are leading. The Israeli stock exchange has provided some of the highest returns in the world, thus proving that despite the war - the future here is bright. Investors understand better than politicians and commentators and they believe in Israel and the fast future that awaits it. And they are right.. The Chairman of the Israel Securities Authority, Seffy Zinger, said that "one of the main factors for the strength of the Israeli capital market is its deep integration with global markets, and especially with the American capital market. The financial ties between us are deep and strong." Zinger recounted a recent meeting in the US with American investors: "What particularly caught their attention was the performance of the Israeli stock exchange compared to global markets. The Tel Aviv-125 index yielded a return of almost 30% in 2024, almost as much as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq indices. This is an especially impressive achievement, given the fact that it took place during the most difficult and complex war in Israel's history. I told those investors: Don't invest in Israel just out of love. Invest in it because it's a good investment." In addition to Smotrich and Zinger, the event was attended by other heads of the economy, including Bank of Israel Governor Prof. Amir Yaron, Finance Ministry Director General Ilan Rom, Israel Stock Exchange Director General Itai Ben Ze'ev, Competition Authority Director Michal Cohen, Capital Market Authority Commissioner Amit Gal, Bank Leumi CEO Hanan Friedman, Phoenix CEO Eyal Ben Simon, Zvi Stepak, co-owner of the investment house Meitav-Dash, BlackRock Israel CEO Anat Levin, venture capitalist Michael Eisenberg, co-founder of the Aleph Fund, businessman Gideon Tadmor, Bank of Jerusalem CEO Yair Kaplan, and former minister and venture capitalist Yizhar Shai, whose son Yaron Shai fell on October 7, and who decided to leverage the pain to establish 1,500 startups to commemorate those murdered and fallen on October 7 and in the Swords of Iron War. Minister Smotrich said that he came to the event from Mount Herzl, where Yosef Yehuda Chirak, who fell yesterday in Gaza, was laid to rest. He said that Huckabee and he met just two days ago with Yehuda Eliyahu, head of the Settlement Directorate at the Defense Ministry, and Chirak’s father-in-law.

BlackRock's IBIT poised to potentially overtake Satoshi Nakamoto's Bitcoin holdings by next summer. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has become the second-largest holder of Bitcoin as of May 20, surpassed only by the infamous wallet of Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of the flagship crypto. According to data compiled by crypto analyst Shaun Edmondson, IBIT currently holds 636,108 BTC, representing over 3% of Bitcoin’s total capped supply of 21 million and nearly 57% of Nakamoto’s estimated 1.12 million BTC stash. With this, BlackRock now holds more Bitcoin than Binance, the largest crypto exchange by trading volume, and Strategy, the largest corporate holder of the bellwether asset. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas suggested that, depending on how Bitcoin performs in the market, the ETF’s Bitcoin holdings could overtake Satoshi’s by next summer. He added that the timeline could accelerate if the asset’s price approaches $150,000. He said such a surge might prompt widespread institutional demand, particularly from financial advisors reallocating client assets into Bitcoin exposure. Since its launch in January 2024, IBIT has become a dominant player in the Bitcoin ETF space. The fund has consistently outpaced other ETFs in inflows and asset growth, including traditional vehicles such as gold ETFs. Its rise has been fueled by growing demand from institutions and retail investors seeking regulated exposure to Bitcoin. According to data from Sosovalue, BlackRock’s IBIT held $66.9 billion in net assets as of May 19, making it the largest Bitcoin ETF by value. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential. He imparts insights on a range of topics like DeFi, hacks, mining and culture, underlining transformative power.

Title: The Significance of Jamie Dimon’s Reluctant Bitcoin Surrender

Correspondent JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon at the Global Markets Conference in Paris on May 15, 2025. Correspondent JPMorgan Chase’s CEO Jamie Dimon has long been one of Bitcoin’s most vicious skeptics. In 2017, he said he would fire any employee who traded Bitcoin for being “stupid,” and called it a “fraud.” Last year, he called the cryptocurrency a “pet rock.” But this week, Dimon announced that JPMorgan Chase would allow its clients to buy Bitcoin. He said it with a grimace on his face, speaking at JPMorgan Chase’s investor day, and rattled off a list of criticisms shared by other Bitcoin cynics, including that the currency facilitated sex trafficking and terrorism. But he conceded that his clients could do what they wished with their money. “I don’t think you should smoke, but I defend your right to smoke. I defend your right to buy Bitcoin. Go at it.” Advertisement Advertisement The decision marks a significant symbolic and practical victory for the Bitcoin community, which, despite its anti-establishment beginnings, has sought institutional acceptance. Dimon, a heavyweight of traditional finance, has consistently used his perch to discourage regular investors and other financial leaders from getting involved. But he has also often been called a pragmatist—and his shift on Bitcoin reflects a changed political climate and mounting client demand.

The entwining of Bitcoin and traditional finance kicked off in January 2024, when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission reluctantly gave the green light for Bitcoin ETFs—investment vehicles which allow people to bet on Bitcoin’s price without actually holding it—to enter the market. Billions of dollars immediately flowed into these ETFs, proving their value to major financial institutions like BlackRock. That summer, Morgan Stanley allowed its wealth advisors to sell Bitcoin ETFs to clients, and Goldman Sachs purchased $418 million worth of them. Then, Donald Trump won the presidency, sending crypto hype into overdrive. On the campaign trail, Trump won over many crypto fans for accusing Biden of choking off the industry. Trump then pledged to make the U.S. the “Bitcoin capital of the world.” Since his election, Trump has thrown both his government influence and personal brand behind cryptocurrency efforts. And the banking sector has been significantly impacted. In his first week in office, Trump repealed SAB 121, a Biden-era accounting rule which discouraged banks from handling crypto assets. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency then rescinded their anti-crypto guidance, leaving much greater discretion to the banks on how to deal with digital assets. Many banks jumped in. Goldman Sachs amassed a stockpile of over $1 billion worth of Bitcoin ETFs. The CEOs of Bank of America and Morgan Stanley both expressed interest in offering crypto products. Dimon could have stuck to his guns and kept JPMorgan out of it. But the bank—which is the biggest in America, with over $3 trillion in assets worldwide— risked losing high-net-worth individuals and institutional clients seeking to diversify their portfolios at a moment of extreme financial volatility. So now, JPMorgan customers will be allowed to buy Bitcoin, he said on Monday. He added, however, that the bank would not custody Bitcoin, necessitating a trusted third party. Dimon’s decision could bring about further change. His capitulation could serve as a powerful signal to other holdouts in traditional finance. And JPMorgan’s massive customer base could bring in a new wave of Bitcoin investors. Crypto Twitter, unsurprisingly, gleefully celebrated his about-face. “Jamie Dimon has bent the knee,” Cory Klippsten, the CEO of Swan, wrote on Twitter. © 2025 TIME USA, LLC. All Rights Reserved.
