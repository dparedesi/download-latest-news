The declining ROI on Bitcoin mining stocks is having an impact too. At the heart of the Bitcoin [BTC] network are miners with major BTC holdings. In today’s volatile market, keeping track of their reserves is more crucial than ever. Interestingly, the amount of BTC held in miner wallets has dropped to a yearly low of just 1.809 million. While factors like rising mining difficulty, breakeven expenses, halving, and reduced rewards are often blamed, there may be a deeper shift at play. This shift could be eroding miners’ influence over the market as more investors flock to alternative investment vehicles like Bitcoin ETFs. As a result, Bitcoin’s network risks becoming more centralized, raising the question – Is this a step forward or a setback for Bitcoin’s decentralized future? A year after the 2008 financial crisis, Bitcoin emerged as a game-changer, eliminating the need for financial middlemen. Over time, it has built a passionate community of ‘believers’ who see BTC not just as a digital asset, but as a powerful symbol of decentralization. It’s no surprise that miners play a key role in making this vision a reality. In the 15 years since Bitcoin’s creation, individual miners have evolved into large companies, now holding significant amounts of BTC themselves. Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA) is leading the way, with over 40k BTC in its reserves. While this is bullish for Bitcoin – driving up accumulation – it also signals a troubling trend – The growing centralization of mining power, now controlled by just a few key players. The plot thickens as investors increasingly turn to mining stocks as an investment tool, closely tied to Bitcoin’s price. When Bitcoin drops, these stocks follow, leaving investors with losses. Source : Ecoinometrics on X As ROI continues to shrink, more investors are pulling out, forcing mining companies to either sell off their Bitcoin holdings or shut down. This dynamic, in turn, directly or indirectly impacts Bitcoin’s price, adding yet another layer of volatility to the market. A closer look at the chart above revealed an interesting pattern – The expected returns on Bitcoin holdings didn’t play out the way mining companies anticipated, particularly as Bitcoin neared the $100k mark. In a typical scenario, this would have caused mining stocks to surge, attracting new investors eager for a slice of the action. And yet, Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA) has been on a steady downtrend, signaling a shift in a market that demands deeper exploration. Since launching in January, Bitcoin ETFs have made it easier for both institutional and retail investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without actually owning it. This new investment vehicle removes the complexities of wallet management and mining. In fact, on the day the “Trump pump” began, $1.3 billion in inflows were recorded into Bitcoin ETFs. Clearly, these newer players are quickly outpacing traditional mining stocks, offering a “less risky” route for investors eager to tap into Bitcoin’s potential. Read Bitcoin [BTC] Price Prediction 2024-2025 But here’s the catch – This shift isn’t without its risks. As big institutions like BlackRock (IBIT) scoop up huge amounts of BTC, Bitcoin’s decentralized nature is starting to feel the strain. In fact, at last count, BlackRock held a staggering 530K BTC. With such large players in the mix, their influence on Bitcoin’s price is undeniable. Investors need to stay sharp, exercise caution, and keep a close eye on their holdings moving forward.

Title: Earthquakes and blowouts undermine case for carbon storage in Texas
URL: https://www.japantimes.co.jp/environment/2024/12/14/energy/texas-carbon-storage-hurdles/

Subscribe Today's print edition Home Delivery Texas has seen surging interest from companies hoping to bury carbon dioxide in its oilfields, putting the state at the vanguard of a government-subsidized program to fight climate change. But pumping CO2 into the ground could exacerbate earthquakes and well blowouts already happening in the Permian Basin as Texas struggles to manage wastewater disposal, potentially undermining public support. "Without legitimate oversight of underground injection in Texas, we expect more geyser-like well blowouts, sinkholes, leaks from plugged and unplugged wells, and injection-induced earthquakes," said Virginia Palacios, executive director of Commission Shift, a Texas watchdog group pushing for tougher oversight of the oil and gas industry. Such consequences have rarely happened as a result of CO2 injection over the decades the technology has been deployed. The unprecedented vast volume of carbon now proposed for burial, however, worries activists and researchers. Carbon sequestration is vital to U.S. government goals to reduce emissions that cause global warming. The Joe Biden administration's 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), landmark climate-change legislation, includes billions of dollars worth of subsidies for carbon, capture and storage (CCS) projects. While President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to gut the act, energy experts say CCS subsidies will likely survive due to bipartisan support. Trump's transition team did not provide comment. Several companies, including Occidental Petroleum, plan to take advantage of IRA subsidies. The projects are concentrated in Texas, where CCS proponents argue underground geology is ideal for storing liquid and gaseous waste. Over the last 12 months, the number of applications filed with the Environmental Protection Agency for carbon injection permits in Texas has jumped by 63% to 43, according to the agency, making it a national leader. But Texas is dogged by problems linked to disposal of drilling wastewater underground. The Texas Railroad Commission (RRC) regulator has grappled with leaks and blowouts from orphan wells, as well as earthquakes, triggered by higher pressure underground from water injection. Reuters spoke with a dozen Texas landowners and researchers who said proposed CO2 projects need more oversight than the state can offer to avert environmental and safety risks. The RRC is seeking authority from the EPA to oversee its own permitting program for carbon sequestration to speed up approvals. The EPA, which is also reviewing Texas' handling of wastewater permitting following the blowouts, said the request was being considered. The RRC said in a statement it is capable of effectively regulating CO2 injection wells, adding it has hired more staff. Trump's victory increases the chances Texas will get this authority, experts say. North Dakota was the first state to receive oversight authority during Trump's first term and its governor, Doug Burgum, is Trump's pick for interior secretary, which includes responsibility for drilling permits on federal land. Burgum did not respond to requests for comment. One of the biggest Texas projects is the Stratos direct air capture joint venture in Ector County between Occidental and asset manager BlackRock. It is expected to inject 8.5 million metric tons of CO2 starting next year. The county has numerous abandoned wells at risk of erupting if underground pressure rises and CO2 eats away at cement plugs, said oil and gas attorney Sarah Stogner, who represents landowners that have had blowouts. There have been 19,700 wells drilled in the county since 1993, according to data from state agencies. Nineteen are orphan wells, with no company legally responsible for ensuring they remain plugged, including three close to the Stratos site. Raymond Straub, a hydrogeologist who owns a Texas groundwater services firm, testified at an October EPA hearing that he was concerned Occidental did not devote enough attention to the unplugged or badly plugged orphan wells in the project area. Occidental spokesperson William Fitzgerald said the company had done extensive site surveys to ensure it would be safe. "This survey confirmed the location of three wells, which Occidental will address prior to beginning CO2 injection," he said. "There is more than 3,000 feet of confining rock layers above the sequestration zone to securely contain the CO2." A pilot project by agribusiness ADM in Illinois, the first of its kind meant to demonstrate the technical feasibility of commercial carbon injection, has suffered leaks and other setbacks, underscoring worries. ADM spokesperson Jackie Anderson said the leaks have presented no risk to surface or groundwater or to public health, and that the company is confident in CCS technology. Dominic DiGiulio, an independent energy analyst and former EPA official who has studied CCS, said, however, that CO2 can corrode the cement casings of plugged wells. "These abandoned wells will in fact leak," he said. A 2023 paper by Chinese researchers, published in Earth-Science Reviews, said CO2 injection could also boost the risk of earthquakes. The researchers did not respond to requests for comment. Large leaks could acidify groundwater, and suffocate people and animals if it displaces oxygen above ground, according to nonprofit Pipeline Safety Trust. "This is supposed to be permanent storage," said Carolyn Raffensperger, executive director of the Science and Environmental Health Network. "If it can’t even contain it for 10 years, why do we think it can contain it forever?" she added, referring to ADM's project.

Title: Why Is Comcast Corporation (CMCSA) Among the Best Income Stocks to Buy According to Analysts?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 16 Best Income Stocks To Buy According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) stands against the other income stocks. When it comes to income investing, dividend stocks are often the first choice for investors. These stocks offer regular payouts to shareholders, which are seen as a way to steadily increase income over time. This approach is backed by data. A report from Hartford Funds revealed that dividends have accounted for 39% of total returns on average since the 1940s. The report also highlighted that stocks with high dividend payouts have not only outperformed other dividend-paying stocks but have done so with lower volatility. Income factor plays a crucial role in investing, as it can significantly boost overall returns, helping investors achieve the portfolio growth needed to meet their financial objectives. A study by Eagle Investment Management highlighted the income potential of dividend-paying stocks. The study compared the returns of a hypothetical $1,000,000 investment made on December 31, 2012, in the Dividend Aristocrats Index—composed of companies that have consistently raised their dividends for 25 years—with the broader market, assuming dividends were reinvested. According to the report, by 2022, the $1,000,000 investment in Dividend Aristocrats would have generated $93,212 in income, compared to just $55,726 from the market. This stark difference emphasized the greater income potential of dividend aristocrats over the broader market. Although this is a historical example, it underscores the importance of not only prioritizing dividends but also focusing on their growth to enhance a portfolio's income stream over time. Also read: 12 Best REIT Dividend Stocks To Buy for 2024 Dividend investing is not a quick path to success; it requires patience and a long-term approach. Over time, high-yielding dividend stocks tend to outperform those that don't pay dividends. According to the French Data Library, while non-dividend-payers may lead the market in certain years, they generally fall short in the long run. Dividend-payers, especially those with higher yields, have consistently outperformed non-payers and even the broader market. The report, which examined returns from 1927 to 2023, found that non-dividend-payers delivered an annualized return of 8.7%, while high-yield stocks returned 10.9%. In comparison, the overall market returned 9.7% during the same period. The report outlined several reasons why dividend-paying stocks tend to outperform others. According to the report, investing in dividend-payers helps filter out the most speculative stocks, as these companies are usually well-established and confident in their cash flow, allowing them to return cash to shareholders. Moreover, dividend-payers are more commonly found in the value segment of the market, and stocks with lower prices and expectations have historically performed well. Dividend payers often build a loyal shareholder base, as investors relying on income from their holdings are less likely to sell due to negative news. Lastly, committing to paying dividends fosters discipline within companies. Executives, tempted by the prospect of using excess cash for acquisitions or speculative projects, are instead compelled to act cautiously and prioritize maintaining dividend payouts. For this reason, investors tend to focus on companies with a proven history of strong dividend growth and high yields. In this article, we will further take a look at some of the best income stocks to buy according to analysts. Our Methodology: To compile this article, we screened for stocks known for their consistent dividend track records and sustained shareholder payouts over an extended period. This group reflects stability and long-term performance in dividend payouts. From this list, we further refined our selection criteria by identifying stocks with a projected upside potential of over 10% based on analyst price targets. The stocks are ranked according to their upside potential, as of December 13. We also considered hedge fund sentiment around each stock in Insider Monkey’s database, as of the third quarter of 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A couple watching their favorite show on TV, enjoying the entertainment network service. Upside Potential as of December 13: 23.4% An American multinational telecommunications company, Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) ranks third on our list of the best dividend stocks. In addition to analysts' projections of an upside potential of over 23%, CMCSA also remained popular among elite funds in the third quarter of 2024, according to Insider Monkey's database. 72 funds held stakes in the company in Q3, growing significantly from 61 in the previous quarter. These stakes are collectively valued at over $5.44 billion. Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) posted $32.07 billion in revenue for the third quarter of 2024, marking a 7% increase compared to the same quarter in the previous year. The company demonstrated solid performance, with broadband ARPU increasing by 3.6% and a 5% rise in its connectivity segment. Adjusted EBITDA margins for the Connectivity & Platforms division reached 40.9%. Additionally, Comcast successfully hosted the Paris Summer Olympics, achieving significant growth in Peacock's revenue and subscriber base, while reinforcing NBC's position as the leading network for the 2023-2024 season. Despite reporting strong earnings, Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) is down by nearly 9% since the start of 2024. The company’s performance has been underwhelming, offering little incentive for investors to engage this year. The results were seen as a short-term boost rather than a sign of sustainable growth, leaving investors unimpressed. That said, Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) maintained a solid cash position from a dividend perspective. In the latest quarter, the company generated over $7 billion in operating cash flow and reported free cash flow exceeding $3.4 billion. Furthermore, it returned $1.2 billion to shareholders through dividends, cementing its status as one of the best dividend stocks on the list. The company has been growing its dividends for 16 consecutive years and pays a quarterly dividend of $0.31 per share. As of December 13, the stock has a dividend yield of 3.11%. Overall CMCSA ranks 3rd on our list of the best income stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of CMCSA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CMCSA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Kevin Power: I took a deep dive into Irish literary magazines and would do it again without hesitation

This November I undertook, voluntarily and for pay (as David Foster Wallace once put it), to read as many Irish literary journals as I possibly could, and to write a report on the state of operations in this particular corner of the culture industry. A supposedly fun thing. Will I ever do it again? The stacked mags made a foot-high pile on my desk. It was imposing. It was downright frightening. The titles, assembled, made an attractive word salad, or perhaps a short experimental poem: Tolka, Ragaire, Banshee, Southword, Sonder, Splonk… Herewith, my lit-mag vibe check, in two parts. Part One (this week) will focus on the nonfiction stuff. Part Two (next week) will be all about fiction and poetry. The lit mag scene being what it is, there will be a certain amount of bleed-through between these categories, the blurring of forms and genres often being what a good contemporary lit mag is all about. Caveat lector. So, what did I read, on my journey through the stack? I read a lot of not-great poetry. Some of this not-great poetry was sort of identity-politics-based, by which I mean that I read a lot of poems about people’s grandmothers making ethnically significant food. Here’s my rule about poetry: the sort of thing that you might want to write a poem about is the sort of thing that you must never write a poem about (your grandmother, your feelings, the winter solstice). I read a lot of psychoanalytic material, imperfectly transformed into fiction. I read about a lot of bad relationships. I read a lot of stories and essays that didn’t quite make it clear where and when their key events were taking place; the effect was confusing. I also read a lot of surprising and original work by surprising and original minds. Would I do it again? You betcha. [ Irish literary magazines: from the visually stunning to the unapologetically plainOpens in new window ] So: the nonfiction journals. Brace yourselves. I’ll start with Holy Show, edited by Brendan McEvilly and Peter McNamara, which appears annually and is the most visually sophisticated (ie attractive) of current Irish lit mags. Its concerns are “Contemporary Irish Life and Art” and it knows that you can’t, or shouldn’t, have one without the other. Therefore it publishes prose pieces alongside art or photographs that speak to them, or vice versa. There is no fiction; criticism is criticism of visual or plastic art. The current issue, number 6, begins with an essay by Caelainn Hogan (author of Republic of Shame) about Mega Dreoilin, “a 16-bit game about Ireland’s housing crisis” made by the artists Han Hogan and Dónal Fullam and exhibited at Pallas Projects/Studios in the Liberties. No mere review this, but engage journalism: personal, passionate. Hogan and Fullam are deeply concerned about the housing crisis, which, they point out, has been artificially generated by vulture funds and landlords operating in cahoots; Hogan takes us to squats and evictions, to parts of Dublin where “Locals [don’t] feel any protection from authorities” where, “with State policy offering little protection,” people “are always one step away from homelessness”. It’s difficult to imagine such an uncategorisable piece of political-journalism-slash-art-criticism about Irish social issues appearing anywhere but in a small literary journal; indeed, pieces like this are one big reason why we should have small literary journals in the first place. This might be as good a time as any to note that almost every lit mag in Ireland is funded, in whole or in part, by the Arts Council. A good reason to pay taxes, if you ask me. The online-only “journal of ideas” Dublin Review of Books (drb.ie) has been a going concern since 2007; edited by Maurice Earls and Enda O’Doherty, and linked osmotically to Books Upstairs on Westmoreland Street, it publishes “long-form essays and shorter pieces, in both cases usually tied to recently published books” and it does so in a new issue thrice yearly. There is no point in me pretending to objectivity about the DRB, since about 60 per cent of my most recently published book is made up of stuff I wrote for the site. But perhaps if I say that I write for the DRB so much because the DRB a dream to write for – catholic in its range, hospitable in its editing – then this will suffice as its own comment. DRB contributors tend to be academics or experts, writing on highbrow subjects for a general audience. The current issue (October 2024) is indicative. It features Anthony Roche reviewing Brian Friel: Beginnings by Kelly Matthews – an essay that doubles as a lucid and compassionate mini-biography of the playwright; Sam Enright on a lecture delivered at UCD by John Maynard Keynes in 1933, touching on “the predicament of how newly independent nations should develop”; and a long, deeply informed review by Kevin Stevens of Percival Everett’s Booker-shortlisted novel James. All of these pieces will repay your time and study. As someone once remarked of the DRB’s older American cousin, the New York Review of Books, reading any given issue is like taking a term of courses at a good university. [ The website that liked books so much it published oneOpens in new window ] Like its cousin, the DRB hardly cleaves to literary or historical topics. It is one of a tiny handful of places in Ireland where you can publish, and read, longform considered reflections on issues of urgent national import. In the current issue is Toy Story, an essay by David Blake Knox. This is ostensibly about the lack of oversight, and the sheer managerial hubris, that resulted in RTÉ losing €2.3 million on Toy Show: The Musical. But really, and most subtly, it’s about how a certain section of Irish society thinks about itself, and how it thinks about Ireland. In telling this particular story in tones of calm sanity and with a forensic eye for detail, Blake Knox, a former RTÉ producer and one of the few people to actually see Toy Show: The Musical when it ran to empty stalls in the Dublin Convention Centre in 2022, does something important: he shows us that one of the traps lurking in Irish public life in the 2020s is a sense of smugness, of self-regarding complacency (aren’t we great, altogether? Sure why would we change?) It has to do with money, of course, this feeling; the thing that made us fall in love with ourselves, when it first landed in our bank accounts back in the late 1990s. Blake Knox shows us that the RTÉ scandals of last year have been misunderstood, and that instead of eating popcorn while we watched poor Ryan Tubridy sweat, we might have done better to see these events as a general warning about how some serious defects in our national self-understanding. In publishing pieces like this one, the DRB is performing a real public service. The editors know this, of course. The tag for Blake Knox’s essay is “Public Service Broadcasting”. [ The best Irish-language books of 2024, another bumper year for all agesOpens in new window ] Tolka’s mission statement commits it to “formally promiscuous nonfiction” which more or less puts it bang in the mainstream of highbrow writing in the 2020s (almost everyone with an MFA, these days, is writing formally promiscuous nonfiction, often about being informally promiscuous). Physically, each issue of Tolka is a gorgeous object; lined up together on a shelf, the white spines are satisfyingly uniform, linked by a little black wave pattern suggesting the Dublin river after which the journal is named. Tolka’s contents, thank goodness, are not at all uniform. Issue 8 kicks off with And No Animal is Without Enemy, a viscerally disturbing personal essay by Megan Nolan (author of Acts of Desperation and Ordinary Human Failings). “Don’t be angry if I tell you that it is the aim of my life to get people to look at me,” this essay begins, but it is not about attention-seeking; it is about self-mutilation, both physical and psychological, and it hinges on a casual hook-up with a lawyer in Hampstead arranged via “a popular fetish site”. It appears to be an excerpt from something longer – a memoir, perhaps? Issue 8 of Tolka also contains Quietly the World Shifts, an essay by Noreen Masud about her involvement in the Fossil Free Books movement’s campaign to get Baillie Gifford, corporate sponsor of book prizes and festivals, to “divest up to £5 billion from fossil fuel companies and from companies profiting from Israeli occupation and genocide in Palestine”. Masud’s question is, “How do we act rightly when there is no reward, neither in the present nor in an imagined future?” Her piece – hopeful, angry – offers one answer. A mention for Declan Toohey’s Bombs Away: Blitzkrieg Notes on Gravity’s Rainbow, also in Tolka Issue 8; this is literary criticism (in this case a response to Thomas Pynchon’s paranoid 1973 masterpiece) as kamikaze warfare – not quite a self-destroying essay, not quite a hallucinatory short story, not quite a transcribed fever dream; formally promiscuous, indeed. [ Books in brief: From the Irish man who invented the penalty kick to an injustice in HullOpens in new window ] Back when I was starting out as a writer, 20-odd years ago, there were only two big lit mag games in Dublin. There was the hospitable and spunky The Stinging Fly, then in its larval stage, and there was The Dublin Review, which seemed too scarily austere to submit to (and still does). Edited, since 2000, by the redoubtable Brendan Barrington, The Dublin Review now looks like an Irish institution. But this is only because it consistently delivers the goods, if by “the goods” you mean superb work by writers old and new. Literary agents who know what’s good for them read The Dublin Review; austere it may seem, but it’s also, no gainsaying it, the place to be. The Dublin Review’s preferred mode is the personal essay, though it also publishes short stories: the current issue, number 96, contains good ones by Sorcha Hamilton and Fiachra Kelleher. The standout piece, however, is a personal essay by William Keohane. It’s called The Assessments, meaning the assessments undergone by Keohane as he sought to begin the process of gender transition, and it’s a masterful piece: clinical, observant, coldly passionate; and speaking clearly to an audience larger than the writer himself, as too many personal essays are not. That’s your nonfiction lot, lit-mag fans. Stay tuned – next week, it’s fiction and (non-grandmother-based) poetry. Kevin Power is an assistant professor of English at Trinity College Dublin.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Discussed 18 Companies That Hit $100 Billion in Market Cap in 2024. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) stands against the other companies that hit $100 billion in market cap in 2024. Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, recently discussed a number of companies that have surpassed $100 billion in market capitalization this year, noting how these companies seem to reflect the current market mood. According to Cramer, it used to be a significant achievement for a company to reach the $100 billion mark, as most companies would never attain that level of market cap. READ ALSO 10 Best Jim Cramer Stocks to Buy According to Analysts and Jim Cramer’s Lightning Rounds: 12 Stocks Under the Spotlight He emphasized the immense effort and determination required to achieve such a feat. However, Cramer pointed out that in today's market, the $100 billion threshold has lost some of its significance, given the recent surge in stock valuations. He highlighted that, as of the market close last Friday, 18 companies had crossed the $100 billion mark in 2024, a notable increase that speaks to the current market dynamics. Cramer acknowledged that stocks, like everything else, had to contend with inflation, which remains a persistent issue. He went on to say: “I know we’re experiencing a heightened market, with expectations really running so hot that you can’t believe that a presidential rally, or, let’s say, an end-of-the-year rally and a stock shortage rally are all in play at once. Many of these stocks got clocked today as part of a sell-off that seemed to infect the year’s best performers. I don't know how long it'll last, maybe some great buying opportunities already.” Cramer concluded that the massive influx of capital into the market is a clear driver behind the rise in companies reaching the $100 billion valuation. “But bottom line: When you get this much money coming in, you can see how all these companies can reach $100 billion, creating a huge amount of wealth, at least on paper. One more reason why it wouldn’t be so bad if some of the winning investors in this market took something delicious off the table.” Our Methodology For this article, we compiled a list of 18 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on December 9. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the third quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A close-up view of a computer motherboard with integrated semiconductor chips. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 107 During Mad Money’s episode, Cramer noted that Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) market cap touched $100 billion in 2024 and said: “Micron, semiconductors, does high bandwidth, 18%... But both Micron and ADI are well off their high, so the whole thing might be a bit of a comedown for them.” Micron (NASDAQ:MU) designs, develops, and manufactures memory and storage products, offering high-speed, low-latency semiconductor devices and non-volatile memory solutions. The growth of AI is expected to play a significant role in the company's future expansion, particularly in the demand for high-bandwidth memory (HBM) used in AI servers. The company has projected that the total addressable market for HBM will increase substantially, from around $4 billion in 2023 to over $25 billion by 2025. On December 10, Reuters reported that the U.S. Department of Commerce has finalized a $6.1 billion subsidy for the company, intended to support the development of several domestic semiconductor manufacturing facilities. This investment, which was originally announced in April, is one of the largest government awards to semiconductor companies under the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act. The funds will help finance factory projects in New York and Idaho. Additionally, Micron (NASDAQ:MU) and the Commerce Department have reached preliminary terms for an extra $275 million investment aimed at expanding the company’s manufacturing facility in Manassas, Virginia, which produces chips primarily for the automotive, networking, and industrial markets. Overall MU ranks 1st on our list of the companies that hit $100 billion in market cap in 2024 according to Jim Cramer.

We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Discussed 18 Companies That Hit $100 Billion in Market Cap in 2024. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) stands against the other companies that hit $100 billion in market cap in 2024. Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, recently discussed a number of companies that have surpassed $100 billion in market capitalization this year, noting how these companies seem to reflect the current market mood. According to Cramer, it used to be a significant achievement for a company to reach the $100 billion mark, as most companies would never attain that level of market cap. READ ALSO 10 Best Jim Cramer Stocks to Buy According to Analysts and Jim Cramer’s Lightning Rounds: 12 Stocks Under the Spotlight He emphasized the immense effort and determination required to achieve such a feat. However, Cramer pointed out that in today's market, the $100 billion threshold has lost some of its significance, given the recent surge in stock valuations. He highlighted that, as of the market close last Friday, 18 companies had crossed the $100 billion mark in 2024, a notable increase that speaks to the current market dynamics. Cramer acknowledged that stocks, like everything else, had to contend with inflation, which remains a persistent issue. He went on to say: “I know we’re experiencing a heightened market, with expectations really running so hot that you can’t believe that a presidential rally, or, let’s say, an end-of-the-year rally and a stock shortage rally are all in play at once. Many of these stocks got clocked today as part of a sell-off that seemed to infect the year’s best performers. I don't know how long it'll last, maybe some great buying opportunities already.” Cramer concluded that the massive influx of capital into the market is a clear driver behind the rise in companies reaching the $100 billion valuation. “But bottom line: When you get this much money coming in, you can see how all these companies can reach $100 billion, creating a huge amount of wealth, at least on paper. One more reason why it wouldn’t be so bad if some of the winning investors in this market took something delicious off the table.” Our Methodology For this article, we compiled a list of 18 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on December 9. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the third quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

A team of financial advisors huddled around a desk, discussing the best investment strategy for their client. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 88 Calling Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) an anomaly, Cramer noted that the stock has returned 45%. “You want [an] anomaly? Hey, how about Citigroup with a total return of 45%, enough to finally let it sneak into the hundred billion-dollar club. Not bad, it’s part of the failings of banks that are finally getting their due.” Citigroup (NYSE:C) is a leading global financial services firm that provides a wide range of financial products, including cash management, trading, and investment banking services. According to CFO Mark Mason at the Goldman Sachs 2024 U.S. Financial Services Conference on December 10, the company is on track to meet the high end of its revenue forecast for 2024, which is between $80 billion and $81 billion. He highlighted that net interest income, excluding markets, has exceeded expectations for the year. While the bank expects its expenses to be near the upper end of the initial guidance, Mason anticipates positive operating leverage extending into 2025 and beyond. In the fourth quarter, investment banking fees are expected to increase by 25% to 30% compared to the previous year, and Markets revenue is projected to rise by a high teen percentage. Mason also noted that equities, particularly prime balances, continue to show strong momentum. Returning capital to shareholders remains a key priority for the company, and Citigroup (NYSE:C) aims to complete $1 billion in share repurchases during the quarter, with $500 million already repurchased. Overall C ranks 6th on our list of the companies that hit $100 billion in market cap in 2024 according to Jim Cramer.

Title: Weekend reading: Managing the less obvious risk in a 60/40 portfolio
URL: https://monevator.com/managing-60-40-risk/
Time Published: 2024-12-14T03:18:37Z
Full Content:
What caught my eye this week. Was there ever a rationale way for investors with a 60/40-style equity/bond portfolio to avoid the worst of the government bond rout of 2022? It’s a question that still bothers me. As a writer and an investing blog owner, mind you, not on my own account. I didn’t own any bonds going into 2022 as an active investor. I’d felt gilts looked a poor risk-reward proposition for years. But fret not – this isn’t a brag… I found plenty of other ways to lose money in 2022. Indeed it was my worst showing on a relative basis in my investing lifetime. However I didn’t own any government bonds. Which meant at least I didn’t suffer the indignity of seeing the supposedly ‘safer’ bit of a portfolio do worse than if I’d gone all-in on stocks. As I wrote in December 2022 in my recap of that woeful year: Vanguard’s popular LifeStrategy funds have put in a Bizarro World performance: This is the opposite of what we’ve come to expect from balanced funds like LifeStrategy. And let’s be honest – it sucks. True, the pain of 2022 has made government bonds investable again. That’s a genuine upside. However for anyone who owned a lot of government bonds before the rout, such a silver lining must feel a bit like when your house burns down and at least you get the chance to plan a new kitchen. Whenever I reproach myself for not writing more about the risks of government bonds on very low yields, my co-blogger The Accumulator reproaches me in turn – by reminding me we did! Long-time Monevator readers may recall such classics as: Also, I did fret openly about a potential government bond crash – way back in 2015! Indeed – and even more tellingly – I first worried government bonds were getting overvalued in 2008, when the financial crisis was still raging and safety was a first resort. As things turned out, the ‘low’ yields that spooked me then – yields which at the time had not been lower since World War II – still hovered above 3%. Bond yields had far lower to go in the years ahead. In fact, gilt prices continued to climb inexorably – and hence their yields fell to near-zero – until 2022, when suddenly everything reversed. So precipitous was the subsequent plunge that the iShares core UK Gilts ETF (ticker: IGLT) is still underwater compared to when I first fretted about low yields in December 2008! IGLT is a distribution fund. Its price doesn’t include the return from dividends. But even if you’d reinvested your income from IGLT, the 16-year gains are puny: Source: iShares Over the same period a world equity tracker multiplied your money nearly six-fold. That’s not so much an opportunity cost as an opportunity catastrophe – unless of course you’d been prescient enough to sell your bonds in 2020. But that’s hindsight speaking. We didn’t know for sure that the world wasn’t headed for another Great Depression in 2008 – or something even worse, if the ATMs had failed and all the banks went bust. And even as yields fell further over the following 14 years, it still seemed futile to bet against bonds. Yields would just be lower again the next year, and you’d be left with egg on your face. The best a strict passive investor could probably do was to reduce their government bonds to a tolerable minimum and hold more cash (and other assets) instead. But remember that for years that would have been a poor trade. The return on cash was nearly nothing. Yet bonds remained a decent investment, delivering steady returns well into the Covid era. Our model Slow & Steady Passive Portfolio, for instance, outperformed our expectations for a 60/40 portfolio for years, in large part thanks to those relentless gains in bonds. So where does all this looking back leave us as we ponder the future? Well, arguably it’s all moot. It’s one thing to say that perhaps there was a case for even a passive investing purist ‘market timing’ away from government bonds when the ten-year yield danced towards zero – and the expected returns from inflation-linked government bonds went negative. But that isn’t where we are now. And there’s no reason to think we’ll see the like again in the next 50 years. Those near non-existent bond yields were probably a special case. In contrast, fiddling when the yield on the ten-year falls to 3.5% and you’d bought at 4% might be the stuff of a lucrative day job on the prop desk of an investment bank. But everyday investors will surely to do worse for such tinkering… …or will they? I’ll conclude with some interesting research shared by Jim Paulsen a couple of weeks ago on the U.S. flavour of a 60/40 portfolio. For his purposes, Paulsen1 defines the ‘cost’ of holding a 60/40 portfolio as being how much it would lag a 100% equity allocation over any particular period. This cost – in terms of foregone returns – is the price you pay for the lower volatility and downside protection of holding government bonds, with their guaranteed return of capital and knowable returns. Digging into the numbers, Paulsen found that the cost has previously soared when the yield on a ten-year US Treasury bond falls below 4%: Source: Paulsen Perspectives There are probably two reasons for this observation over this period. Firstly is the one Paulsen focuses on. When bond yields are low, you’re not getting compensated as much for owning government bonds in terms of income. On an inflation-adjusted basis, you might not be making money at all. But secondly, I suspect there’s an equity timing signal buried here. When government bond yields are very low, it’s probable people are more fearful than usual. They’ve likely bought government bonds for safety, presumably in part with money that could instead be invested in shares. In that case equity valuations may be depressed – implying potentially higher returns from the ’60’ part of the portfolio going forward. Whatever the reason, Paulsen suggests the 4% yield level could act as a trigger for US investors to look again at their asset allocation should the ten-year US treasury yield fall below 4%. Rightly he doesn’t suggest wholesale abandonment of a diversified portfolio, writing: The 60/40 balanced portfolio makes sense for many investors and there is no reason to abandon balanced management even if the 10-year Treasury yield does decline again below the 4% trigger. However, 60/40 investors may want to consider occasionally altering the balance mix depending upon which side of the Trigger they find themselves. If you generally are a 60/40 investor, perhaps you could adopt the simple rule of being 50/50 when above the yield Trigger and switching to 70/30 when below the yield Trigger. Depending on each individuals’ risk tolerance, this ‘toggle approach’ may not be appropriate. But for those balance investors who may want to try and take advantage of the 4% Trigger and keep the ‘relative cost’ of balanced management reasonable, adjusting the mix slightly around the toggle may prove profitable, perhaps as soon as in 2025. Finally I’d note that Paulsen’s backwards data dive only ran to 1945 (when, as I said above, bond yields were last very low) and also that this is US data, with its rip-roaring equity gains to greatly plump up the ‘cost’ side of the equation. Still, food for thought. Especially if yields ever do descend into the depths again. Have a great weekend.

Thanks for all the wisdom and thought provoking posts over the last year, and best wishes to you and all Monevator readers. My view is that it is very important from a passive investor to focus on yield and to probably buy gilts direct. Then you can pick the yield for a given duration. Buying gilts near 5% to 2055+ means you can hold forever at an okay return. Buying at 0.5% or not getting a long term on a 1% mortgage is risky not being smart by being passive. Think it applies to equities too though which makes Asia UK, Europe etc lower risk but S&P and world indexes high risk. If you are being passive just check the yield on everything. The change to Vanguard’s fees is annoying. I have around 12k in a SIPP there, and am unlikely to add any more anytime soon, as I’m in a public sector job with a good DB pension, so ISAs just make more sense as a savings vehicle for me. Which means Vanguard has basically just tripled my platform fees. Time to move, I think. Probably to DODL? I already have my lifetime ISA there, and would rather not have too many of my eggs in one basket. But doesn’t seem like there’s a great range of options for small SIPPs atm. 60/40 – for a long time the one-size-fits-all for financial planning isn’t fit for purpose – much like my own years of over investing in the stagnant FTSE100 (bond like super tanker company, dividend aristocrats who only occasionally mess up). But reading Simple Living (and his last post is great) mentioned that his own bond allocation was probably served by his Final Salary pension. That spurred me into a more “risky” approach of pretty much going all in for global ETF trackers(in part to drive down fees). So the future of me and bonds… I could always payoff the mortgage at 4.45% ( thanks Liz) but I would rather leverage and invest in equities instead. Yes, very disappointing from Vanguard. Supposedly one of the ‘good guys’. Investengine have in the last few days approved transfers in to their platform-fee free SIPP. But only from Vanguard (see what they did there?) . And they only do ETFs and I don’t think they can handle in-specie. I’d recently convinced a young, self employed relative to start putting something away into a Vanguard SIPP. This move from Vanguard puts her fees up from about £2 a year to £48. Looks like Investengine will work for her instead. It’s an odd move by Vanguard to punish young investors at the start of their investing careers. You’d have thought they’d want to retain their custom throughout their investing career. Throw in the fact that fees on most of their passive offerings are around 10bps more expensive than comparable offerings and I’m beginning to lose a bit of faith in Vanguard. Thanks for yet another batch of interesting links and thoughtful commentary. The Madrid Metro article makes fascinating reading and is quite timely given the UKs increased centralisation of planning decisions as announced recently. Another thought provoking discussion regarding bonds. I’m currently with Vanguard and from a quick look don’t believe I’m affected by the fee increase. One word of warning however, regarding moving to another platform is the customer service that Vanguard provides that some platforms don’t. They have been very good with several queries that I’ve had over the years. Liked ‘The Wire’ quote- there are numerous ones of wisdom in that show! Season’s Greetings to all at Monevator and their readership. Lee. As someone who buys government bonds directly and holds them to maturity, I couldn’t care less how their price moves. I know what yield I will get, and I made the decision to buy them at that yield. The problem isn’t that yields can fall. It’s that inflation can rise. If that happens my real yield will fall. I have some index linked gilts for that, but of course their yield is a joke. Then again I knew this when I bought them. The risk from a 60/40 portfolio, therefore, is really inflation. That’s why it doesn’t really matter if you think bonds are overvalued – it matters if you think inflation is underestimated. I have a family member who has a tiny amount in a Vanguard ISA (well under the 32,000) so they are going to have to move. It seems like either Dodl or Invest Engine are the ones people are thinking about? One more vote of confidence in InvestEngine from me – their customer service were very helpful in producing the exact statement my compliance department needed, and the service itself is a pleasure to use. They have a swap based S&P 500 tracker, a physically replicated World Ex US ETF and an Emerging Markets ex-China ETF, as well as offering cost free rebalancing, so you can build a cost optimised All-World ETF from Finumus’s recipe despite not having a high invested amount. https://investengine.com/share/portfolio/2bad7a83414d7700cde20b822ccfce922c7280f0/ The only thing that worries me is what their business model is – is payment for order flow enough? I just checked Hargreaves Lansdown’s website and I cannot see any offer for cashback when transfer a SIPP. How new/old is this offer? Thanks. Thanks @TI for Vanguard heads-up. Mrs 2MY has Vanguard SIPP a little below the £32k (and missed the T&Cs email!). When she retires this time next year, TFLS plus very slow drawdown topping up SP to TFA will make an increasing difference. Annoying as they’ve been very good in all other respects. Additional fees will be marginal for the next 12 months so inclined to keep a watching brief; noting IE not slow to make a grab! Anyone have experience of IE in drawdown? Their website goes a bit quiet on this. I don’t think Investengine offer drawdown (not yet at least). I only know this as I was looking to start a SIPP myself this week and almost opened a Vanguard one the day before they announced the fee change! The Behavioural Investment 2025 Forecast roundup was absolutely brilliant — good find! But fun aside, while most of Monevator’s readers likely don’t share my soft spot for Jamie Dimon, I must say, his musings on inflation (as seen in this interview https://youtu.be/bI1TL3svaGs?si=kA_IJOI6E-FwWMwk) aren’t completely daft. Love him or loathe him, keeping an eye on inflation might be a 2025 prediction worth taking seriously. Still, more funnies from Behavioural Investment, please — it really made me chuckle. I just had email confirmation from Investengine. They can accept in specie SIPP transfers, assuming they offer the exact same product as Vanguard. Which they will if you’re in ETFs. Im still not clear if they can accept partial in specie transfers if you have holdings in a mixture of funds and ETFs. My assumption is that you can but I did not confirm. I bought into L/S 40/60 in2017 (I was nearing retirement and was looking for a safer plan) last year and this I would have done better in a local Building Society . Oh dear. @David 15 What numbers/dates are you using? If I use something like the Royal London short term money market fund as a proxy for cash interest rates, then from June 2017 to date I get: LS 40 – ~28% LS 60 – ~48% RL short term- ~13.2% The 60/40 portfolio gets extensive discussion on the Bogleheads forum and American financial blogs generally (I notice the videos of the latest Bogleheads meet are in the links this week) The conclusion seems to be for those American investors using a total stock market index for their equities and bonds -this asset allocation ie 60/40 -then held for ever through thick and thin -the results have been good-certainly better than equivalent actively managed portfolios Most stockmarket drops of course have been on the equity side but the stockmarket has many twists and turns -predicting and then the escaping these oscillations seems to be difficult-impossible? U.K. investigators like me have also managed to to do reasonably well copying this 60/40 allocation albeit with a global equity and bonds held for their portfolio (Should just have held American equities and bonds?) A U.K. investor with a 60/40 portfolio with a built in U.K. bias will have done less well Another conclusion seems to be that 60/40 is a fairly arbitrary choice and variations between 30/70 to 70/30 have done similarly well -the choice depending on the investors attitude to risk ,volatility size of portfolio etc “Staying the course” seems to be the other essential ingredient xxd09 @Jon Snow — Hmm I agree, it’s not there now. I’m sure it was there and valid last night! I haven’t included them in the links for ages, and only brought them back for this deal. Also I pulled the 10 January deadline info in my blurb off their promo. Actually that date a clue perhaps that they they have withdrawn it…the short time window to complete the application implies a limited ‘budget’ allocated to new transfer incentives. I wonder if they are somehow getting overwhelmed with Vanguard exiles? Doesn’t seem super likely though, as they are not a straight swap in terms of cost profile by any means. Thanks for the heads-up! 🙂 @all — Just to add, I am hopeful that @TA is going to be able share some thoughts on Vanguard and if/where to move as soon as Monday or Tuesday. So please watch this space, and as always the comments under his article. 🙂 I’ve got a lump of VGOV bond ETF in my SIPP, still underwater. Risk rating 5 and paying 4% dividends. I also have VHYL High Dividend Yield equity ETF risk rating 6 paying 3% dividends. The VGOV plan didn’t work as expected to “smooth the ride”! I can’t bring myself to crystallise the loss – hoping it may improve if interest rates ever come down some more. Yes, I need to look into direct gilt holdings. When I got the Vanguard email I was expecting to open it and discover they’d reduced their platform charge, what a surprise! Very frustrating for young investors starting out. The one thing going for Vanguard I think is they won’t be sold into private equity if that is a concern. I started a SIPP with them but found transfers in very slow, gave up with it and consolidated more with HL. It is actually cheaper for me to hold Vanguard ETFs with HL too. I hope the slow transfers with Vanguard have improved if they’re upping their fees. @Jon Snow – I can see the HL SIPP cashback offer registration here https://www.hl.co.uk/features/register-cashback-pc Register by January the 10th. If you’re a customer and have issues, call them. They’re very helpful. About moving from Vanguard to Investengine, you are moving from a global sized company to a really small company who had yet to make a profit. It’s not always about saving a few pounds it’s about the big picture. As for availing of the HL cashback, they are on course to delisting from the London stock market to disappear into a private equity buy out. It is of course your money your choice. @GF The same thought had occured to me about moving my SIPP from Vanguard to Investengine, and am currently tempted by the Fidelity SIPP which is only £90 a year if you use ETFs. However is the change to HL likely to make it detectably more risky – either way it is a huge (and too big to fail?) UK broker? @Ben Ber. I struggle to see how private Equity can improve HL. When I open up my PE play book then the way to go is put a lot of debt on the balance sheet. Cut as many staff as you can and generally squeeze as much as you can relying on HL customers unwillingness to move. I just can’t see them going for all out growth, squeeze the cash cow is the most likely choice. @TI 60/40 went through the wringer in 2022, but it should be rather better placed to deliver now vis a vie 100 equity. But why settle for just 60/40 when 90/60 is now available? The WisdomTree Global Efficient Core UCITS ETF has recently been listed on the LSE in both USD (NTSG) and GBP (WGEC). 0.25% p.a. OCF. Your getting a 90% global developed markets equity tracker, but with 60% high quality developed world bonds thrown in. 1 ETF for implementing Lars’ 2 asset class solution, but without giving up 40 to make room for gov. bonds. @GF & @Ben Ber: On HL and PE: it’s hard to know how much (or how little) to be concerned. A known unknown. There were some articles here on MV in recent years about UK broker protections, but (IIRC) it was not exactly a greatly reassuring picture. We haven’t (yet) had a 2007/8 moment for fund platforms, like we did for the retail banks. The big practical issues are where, when and how to move. 90% logistics, only 10% strategy. For all its drawbacks, HL are still only £45 and £200 annual platform fee caps respectively for ISAs and SIPPs (nowt for GIAs) for holding ETFs, ITs, individual shares and gilts (notwithstanding the extortionate 0.45% p.a. headline rate for holding OEICs). Their customer service remains OK (but used to be great) with fairly prompt responses to secure messages and a UK phone line. OTOH, the HL FX rates and £12 dealing fee are steep, and look like something a late 1990s stockbroker would charge. Their selection of ETFs is also not as broad as you might think and there can be issues buying certain ETFs and ITs. If it weren’t for the PE buy out I’d stay put, but there’s that uncertainty to try and parse now, and there’s also lot of choice and switching incentives these days. The HL offer appears to be by invitation only: “Subject to these terms and conditions, if you have been invited to take part in the Transfers Cashback Offer (October 2024 – January 2025)…” “To be eligible for the Offer, you must: have received a communication from Hargreaves Lansdown inviting you to the offer” @BillD (#31): Re: “When I got the Vanguard email I was expecting to open it and discover they’d reduced their platform charge, what a surprise! Very frustrating for young investors starting out.” Yup, that is what I thought the email might say – and it is how Vanguard (V/G) have built their business. I do wonder if JB had still been around if this would have happened? I just so happen to currently have several a/c’s (with different providers) that meet the criteria – albeit they are not with V/G. So, it is not just greenhorns that may be impacted. Had these a/c’s been with V/G (which some of them nearly were) it would not have effected me, due to my other V/G holdings. However, given how much V/G take off of me for those other [buy & hold] holdings I think the changes are actually pretty shameful! Is this just the latest sign that things are not so good with V/G in the UK, or V/G more generally? IIRC, in the UK they dropped cash interest rates and took some missteps with an advised offering.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Discussed 18 Companies That Hit $100 Billion in Market Cap in 2024. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW) stands against the other companies that hit $100 billion in market cap in 2024. Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, recently discussed a number of companies that have surpassed $100 billion in market capitalization this year, noting how these companies seem to reflect the current market mood. According to Cramer, it used to be a significant achievement for a company to reach the $100 billion mark, as most companies would never attain that level of market cap. READ ALSO 10 Best Jim Cramer Stocks to Buy According to Analysts and Jim Cramer’s Lightning Rounds: 12 Stocks Under the Spotlight He emphasized the immense effort and determination required to achieve such a feat. However, Cramer pointed out that in today's market, the $100 billion threshold has lost some of its significance, given the recent surge in stock valuations. He highlighted that, as of the market close last Friday, 18 companies had crossed the $100 billion mark in 2024, a notable increase that speaks to the current market dynamics. Cramer acknowledged that stocks, like everything else, had to contend with inflation, which remains a persistent issue. He went on to say: “I know we’re experiencing a heightened market, with expectations really running so hot that you can’t believe that a presidential rally, or, let’s say, an end-of-the-year rally and a stock shortage rally are all in play at once. Many of these stocks got clocked today as part of a sell-off that seemed to infect the year’s best performers. I don't know how long it'll last, maybe some great buying opportunities already.” Cramer concluded that the massive influx of capital into the market is a clear driver behind the rise in companies reaching the $100 billion valuation. “But bottom line: When you get this much money coming in, you can see how all these companies can reach $100 billion, creating a huge amount of wealth, at least on paper. One more reason why it wouldn’t be so bad if some of the winning investors in this market took something delicious off the table.” Our Methodology For this article, we compiled a list of 18 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on December 9. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the third quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A cutting-edge computer lab full of IT experts monitoring the security of multiple systems. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 64 Cramer has liked Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW) for some time now and recently commended its CEO, saying: “Last but not least, we've got a cybersecurity company that CNBC investing club members know all too well called Palo Alto Networks, up 37%... Big deal for Palo Alto, a huge journey undertaken by CEO Nikesh Aurora…” Palo Alto (NASDAQ:PANW) is one of the most recognized cybersecurity companies in the world, providing a comprehensive range of security solutions aimed at protecting organizations from the ever-changing landscape of digital threats. The company recently reported strong financial performance for its fiscal 2025 first quarter, surpassing consensus estimates and raising its guidance for the full year. In the first quarter of fiscal 2025, the company generated $2.1 billion in revenue, marking a 14% increase compared to the same period last year. Its EPS rose by an impressive 77%, reaching $0.99. The company's next-generation security services, which are a key area of growth, saw its annual recurring revenue surge by 40% to $4.5 billion. Palo Alto (NASDAQ:PANW) also highlighted a notable increase in the size of customer deals. The number of customer accounts spending over $1 million on its cybersecurity platform grew by 13% year over year, reaching 305 accounts. More significantly, the number of accounts spending over $5 million saw a 30% increase, growing at an even faster pace. Overall PANW ranks 11th on our list of the companies that hit $100 billion in market cap in 2024 according to Jim Cramer. While we acknowledge the potential of PANW as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

A technician working on power management in a semiconductor factory. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 63 Cramer noted that as of last Friday’s close, Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADI) stock was up 11%. “Analog Devices, that's internet of things, up 11%... But both Micron and ADI are well off their high, so the whole thing might be a bit of a comedown for them.” Analog Devices (NASDAQ:ADI) designs and manufactures integrated circuits, software, and subsystems, offering products for data conversion, power management, amplifiers, radio frequency ICs, and micro-electromechanical systems. The company recently reported its fourth-quarter earnings, with revenue of $2.4 billion, exceeding analyst expectations. Adjusted EPS stood at $1.67, also slightly above estimates. However, the company saw significant year-over-year declines, particularly in its industrial segment, which dropped by 21% in the quarter and 35% for the fiscal year. CEO and Chairman Vincent Roche acknowledged these challenges, attributing them to unprecedented customer inventory pressures. Despite this, he highlighted the resilience of the company's business model, which allowed the company to maintain operating margins above 40%. During the earnings call, Analog Devices (NASDAQ:ADI) management emphasized the company's ongoing focus on research and development, which contributed to the double-digit growth in its design win pipeline for fiscal 2024. The company also mentioned the momentum in its Maxim revenue synergies pipeline, particularly in sectors like GMSL, healthcare, and data center power. This progress is seen as a crucial step toward the company’s goal of achieving $1 billion in revenue synergies by 2027. Overall ADI ranks 12th on our list of the companies that hit $100 billion in market cap in 2024 according to Jim Cramer. While we acknowledge the potential of ADI as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

A financial analyst looking at the news, analyzing the trends of the insurance market. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 54 Talking about Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. (NYSE:MMC), Cramer noted that the insurance business is “on fire”. “... Not to mention insurance broker Marsh & McLennan, that's up 20%. The insurance business is on fire and we know from these egregious CPI numbers, one comes out this Wednesday, they just keep raising rates. These three are winners for certain.” Marsh & McLennan (NYSE:MMC) is a professional services firm offering advisory and solutions in risk management, strategy, and people-related areas, including insurance and reinsurance broking, analytics, and strategic consulting. On December 11, RBC Capital analyst Scott Heleniak raised the rating on the company stock from Sector Perform to Outperform, with a revised price target of $250, up from $242. The firm considers Marsh a "high-quality insurance broker" with strong visibility into robust sales and earnings growth through 2025. The company's diverse business mix offers stability, making it less vulnerable to fluctuations in property and casualty pricing as the cycle progresses. RBC anticipates that the McGriff acquisition will enhance Marsh's position in the middle market and finds the stock's valuation appealing, as it trades at a discount compared to some competitors. In November, Marsh & McLennan (NYSE:MMC) announced its acquisition of McGriff Insurance Services for $7.75 billion, as the industry prepares for increased business spending on policies amid a stronger economic outlook. The company stated that the deal, made through its Marsh McLennan Agency division, is expected to strengthen the unit's offerings in commercial property and casualty, employee benefits, management liability, and personal insurance. Overall MMC ranks 13th on our list of the companies that hit $100 billion in market cap in 2024 according to Jim Cramer.

The 70-year-old is widely credited with predicting the stock market collapse on Black Monday in 1987 when the Dow Jones fell a whopping 22%. Jones' hedge fund, Tudor Investment Corp, has posted average annual returns of roughly 19% over its more than four-decade existence, according to Hedge Fund Alpha, and Jones is reportedly worth over $8 billion, according to Forbes. Hershey (NYSE: HSY) is in the headlines because Mondelez (NASDAQ: MDLZ) is rumored to have made (another) offer to buy the company. Hershey stock rose sharply on that news, but don't get your hopes up. It isn't shocking that Mondelez's name would come up with regard to acquiring Hershey.

While chipmaker Nvidia is an obvious example of a top growth stock to own given its more than 2,500% return over the past five years, there are many other stocks that have produced incredible gains in a short stretch. Three stocks that have done phenomenally well this year and have outperformed Nvidia are AppLovin (NASDAQ: APP), MicroStrategy (NASDAQ: MSTR), and Summit Therapeutics (NASDAQ: SMMT). If you invested $5,000 into each one of these stocks at the beginning of the year, the total of those investments would be worth more than $100,000 right now. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) and Marvell Technology (NASDAQ: MRVL) have enjoyed contrasting fortunes on the stock market in 2024, with one of these names delivering stellar gains while the other one is in the red. AMD has been playing second fiddle to Nvidia in the market for AI data center graphics processing units (GPUs). Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) stock has sold off in recent weeks. Weak PC sales and worries about competition in the artificial intelligence (AI) accelerator market seem to have weighed on the stock. Its $18 billion in revenue for the first nine months of 2024 rose 10%, far below the triple-digit revenue increases of its main rival, Nvidia. Sign in to access your portfolio

(NYSE:PLTR) is favored due to its high-profile government contracts and the buyers’ belief in it to reshape the U.S. defense budget. “Next up is an enterprise software company, Palantir, which exploded on the scene this year with some big contracts and some big growth. Palantir came public via direct listing in 2020. It kind of hung out doing nothing until its sales finally took off and then man, this thing was just a rocket ship. Palantir is the brains behind much of the military that we don't know about. Palantir (NYSE:PLTR) is a developer of advanced software platforms and is known for its work with government agencies. Earlier in the year, it secured a $480 million contract with the U.S. Department of Defense to develop the Maven Smart System, set to be completed by 2029. In November, it also partnered with Anthropic and AWS to offer U.S. agencies access to Claude AI models, enhancing data processing and decision-making capabilities. More recently, on December 9, the company expanded its contract with the U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) with a one-year, $36.8 million deal to support the Mission Command System (MCS) and enhance technology for U.S. Special Operations Forces globally. The deal includes deploying AI capabilities and fast-tracking software deployment using Palantir's Ontology Software Development Kit. Additionally, on December 6, Palantir (NYSE:PLTR) announced that the company and Anduril Industries are launching a consortium to help the U.S. lead in artificial intelligence, focusing on developing infrastructure to transform AI advancements into next-generation military and security capabilities. The partnership aims to address two main challenges: data readiness and processing data at scale. To tackle the latter, they will use Palantir’s AI Platform (AIP) for cloud-based data management and AI development, meeting both commercial and national security needs. Overall PLTR ranks 17th on our list of the companies that hit $100 billion in market cap in 2024 according to Jim Cramer. While we acknowledge the potential of PLTR as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

A robotic arm holding a semiconductor chip, emphasizing the precision and quality of the company's production equipment. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 38 Cramer highlighted that under the leadership of its CEO Rene Haas, Arm Holdings plc (NASDAQ:ARM) stock has roared and its market cap reached $100 billion in 2024. “We are having a tough time getting IPOs to market, which means the ones we do get tend to be priced too low thanks to a paucity of buyers and that's what I think happened with the stock of Arm Holdings, the semiconductor architecture company that's partnered with Nvidia for all sorts of gizmos and it's all over the cell phone and servers too. Arm’s growing incredibly fast and CEO Rene Haas has steered the company's stock to an 87% return, joining the hundred billion dollar pantheon.” Arm (NASDAQ:ARM), a key player in the semiconductor industry, specializes in designing and licensing central processing unit technology and related components. Rather than manufacturing chips itself, it generates revenue through licensing its processor designs and collecting royalty fees from companies that integrate its technology into their products. With the rise of advanced technologies like AI, the company expects to see increased demand for its chip architectures, as the complexity of chips grows to accommodate these emerging technologies. In line with this trend, the company reported significant growth in its licensing business. By the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2025, the company had secured 39 Arm Total Access licenses, up from 33 in the previous quarter. Additionally, the number of Arm Flexible Access licensees increased from 241 to 269, reflecting a broader adoption of its technology. This expansion in licenses directly correlates with increased royalty revenue, as the chips created using these licenses are sold and used in a variety of devices and systems. Earlier it was disclosed that Nvidia's largest investment of $147.3 million was in Arm (NASDAQ:ARM), which it failed to acquire due to an antitrust issue two years ago. Additionally, CEO Rene Haas, highlighted a shift in the company's business model, explaining that in the past, it would have seemed unrealistic for Arm to charge $100 per system-on-a-chip (SoC). However, with its pricing now set between 50 cents and $1 per core, Arm is generating over $100 per SoC when multiple cores are included. Haas pointed out that this new pricing structure reflects the growing value of Arm's technology in the burgeoning AI and cloud computing sectors. Overall ARM ranks 18th on our list of the companies that hit $100 billion in market cap in 2024 according to Jim Cramer. While we acknowledge the potential of ARM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Title: Pantera Capital Founder Projects Bitcoin Market Cap To Soar To $15 Trillion

Dan Morehead, founder and managing partner of Pantera Capital Management, has reiterated his bullish stance on Bitcoin, predicting that the pioneering cryptocurrency could eventually command a $15 trillion market cap. Morehead’s comments came during a recent interview on CNBC’s “Squawk Box,” where he also highlighted Pantera’s original Bitcoin fund surpassing a 1,000x return since its inception in 2013. According to Morehead, institutional exposure to crypto is still woefully inadequate. He notes that “the median institutional ownership of blockchain is zero,” and even trailblazing investors typically hold just 1–2% of their allocations in digital assets. He characterized the opportunity as massive, citing that “95% of financial wealth has no investments in blockchain whatsoever,” which translates to minimal overall exposure—often a fraction of a percent. Reflecting on the early days of crypto, Morehead recalls years of unclear regulations deterring institutions from making meaningful commitments. With Donald Trump to take office, he envisions more supportive frameworks for digital assets, hinting that the US government could mirror its early internet-era strategy: “93% of the [crypto] market cap is based outside the United States,” he said, underscoring the need for domestic regulatory clarity. When asked about the possibility of President-elect Trump establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, Morehead commented: “I think there are two versions of that. One is that the president-elect said he will not sell the Bitcoins the US already owns. The United States owns 1% of the world’s Bitcoins. That seems easier to do than getting passage to buy additional Bitcoins. I think it is a great strategy. The US is the reserve currency of the world. We don’t have another currency to save our reserves in. So saving in Bitcoin would be a great strategic move.” Despite Bitcoin’s meteoric gains, Morehead believes there is room for further growth, especially as many large investors remain skeptical. He recounted raising only $1 million during 170 investor meetings in 2016—an experience that reinforced the notion that widespread adoption was still years away. Now, with mainstream financial giants offering Bitcoin, Morehead no longer worries about BTC price going to zero. “50 million people in the US, 300 million globally own it. Blackrock and Fidelity are selling it. It has reached escape velocity,” Morehead remarked. Looking ahead, Morehead outlined a vision of BTC’s market cap reaching $15 trillion, with the price per coin potentially rising to $740,000: “It has gone up three orders of magnitude since we launched our fund, I think it can go up a fourth. And that puts it at a $15 trillion market cap, which still seems relatively small compared to $500 trillion of financial assets. That’s doable.” In a recent investor note, Morehead revealed that BTC could reach this target as early as April 2028. At press time, BTC traded at $100,000.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best Telecom Stocks To Invest In Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T) stands against the other telecom stocks. The global telecom services market was valued at $1.80 trillion in 2022 and is projected to grow at a 6.2% compound annual growth rate through 2030, as reported by Grand View Research. This growth is driven by factors such as 5G infrastructure investments, a rising number of mobile subscribers, increasing demand for high-speed data, and the growing need for managed services. This industry has undergone a remarkable evolution since its inception. From early forms of communication like voice and basic visual signals transmitted over wired infrastructure, it has progressed to today's sophisticated landscape of exchanging audio, video, and text content across diverse wireless networks. This evolution is marked by advancements in data speeds, transitioning from early technologies like GSM and CDMA to 3G, and 4G, and now the commercialization of 5G, enabling rapid data transfer that was once unimaginable. According to Forbes, one of the driving forces for the telecom industry in 2025 will be the continued rollout and maturation of 5G technology. 5G will deliver faster speeds and improved connectivity and also unlock a new era of possibilities, such as enabling immersive experiences like VR/AR, powering advanced industrial applications, and driving innovation across a wide range of sectors. While 5G is currently being deployed, attention is shifting to 6G, which promises to deliver significantly enhanced capabilities. IDTechEx recently reported that 6G will revolutionize communication by operating in the terahertz (THz) spectrum. This will enable unprecedented data rates (Tbps) and ultra-low latency. Beyond speed, 6G will unlock new applications like energy harvesting and advanced sensing. To achieve this, 6G will utilize higher frequency bands (7-20 GHz, W-band, D-band) for both access and backhaul. However, higher frequencies present challenges like atmospheric absorption and interference. Overcoming these requires optimizing link budgets through advancements in semiconductor technology. While CMOS may suffice for lower frequencies, SiGe and InP technologies are crucial for higher frequencies. SiGe BiCMOS offers a good balance of performance and cost, while InP provides the highest performance. Furthermore, Antenna-in-Package (AiP) technology is vital for integrating antennas directly into semiconductor packages, crucial for high-frequency communication, particularly in the mmWave and sub-THz ranges. Methodology We sifted through the Finviz stock screener to compile an initial list of top telecom stocks to invest in. We then selected the 12 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q3 2024. The hedge fund data was sourced from Insider Monkey’s database which tracks the moves of over 900 elite money managers. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A person in the field using their smartphone to connect to wireless communication services. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 59 AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T) is a global leader in telecommunications and technology, offering services across two segments: Communications and Latin America. The Communications segment provides wireless, wireline, and broadband services to consumers and businesses in the US, while the Latin America segment focuses on wireless services in Mexico. The company experienced robust growth in 5G subscribers during the third quarter, adding 403,000 postpaid phone net additions, which was achieved with a decrease in churn and upgrade rates. This performance translated into an increase in Mobility EBITDA, exceeding the full-year guidance by reaching a growth rate of over 6%. Mobility EBITDA grew by $600 million year-over-year, reaching $9.5 billion, driven by a 4% increase in Mobility service revenue. This strong foundation sets the stage for continued success in the fourth quarter, with the anticipated seasonal factors expected to fuel growth further. AT&T Inc.'s (NYSE:T) focus on 5G subscriber growth is a key driver of its overall success. Overall T ranks 2nd on our list of the best telecom stocks to invest in now. While we acknowledge the potential of T as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than T but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

A smiling customer receiving customer contact center solutions on their smartphone. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 57 Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) is a global provider of communication, technology, and entertainment services. Operating through its Consumer and Business segments, it offers a range of products and services, including wireless, wireline, FWA broadband, IoT solutions, and more. The company serves consumers, businesses, and government entities with a focus on delivering innovative and reliable solutions. The company has demonstrated strong success in the fixed wireless access market, surpassing the initial target of 4-5 million subscribers 15 months ahead of schedule, as of Q3 2024. Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) plans to double its fixed wireless subscriber base to 8-9 million by 2028. This goal will be achieved through a multi-pronged strategy that includes aggressive deployment of C-Band and millimeter wave technologies to enhance coverage and capacity, the introduction of innovative solutions to serve multi-dwelling units with high-speed internet, and continuous R&D investments. Third Point Management stated the following regarding Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “While some economic activity has been showing signs of slowing, the defensive composition of the current high yield market with a high mix of higher quality credit and short duration has let the rates tailwind overwhelm such concerns. The lowest quality sectors of the market have performed best, fueled by both soft/no landing expectations, as well as two positive events in the beleaguered telecom space. Telecom/cable have been poor performers year to date due to overhang from the growth of FWA (aka “wireless cable”) and increased fiber building, however the sector re-rated materially on two deals. Second, Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) announced a deal to acquire Frontier Communications (FYBR), a transaction which the fund benefited from by virtue of its investment in FYBR debt. This transaction, aimed at increasing’s VZ fiber footprint, has led to broad revaluation of fiber retail networks that we think is appropriate. While we continue to expect to see FWA rapidly erode non-upgraded cable and especially copper’s share of the low-end broadband market, the VZ deal underscores the value of the higher end footprint.” Overall VZ ranks 3rd on our list of the best telecom stocks to invest in now. While we acknowledge the potential of VZ as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

(Azoria) Bradley Devlin / @bradleydevlin Bradley Devlin is politics editor for The Daily Signal. Send an email to Bradley. During his first term, President-elect Donald Trump took to calling Mar-a-Lago—the 62,500-square-foot, Spanish Revival-style mansion that doubles as a private club and Trump’s private residence—the Winter White House or the Southern White House. That Mar-a-Lago is again the Winter White House probably makes Marjorie Merriweather Post, the breakfast cereal heiress who built it in the 1920s, smile from beyond the grave. Upon her death in 1973, Post donated the residence to the National Park Service, hoping one day that the compound would be used as precisely that. As Trump has been the center of gravity of American politics for nearly the past decade, the right’s most politically connected are frequently seen orbiting Mar-a-Lago and, more broadly, Palm Beach, Florida. Washington creatures aren’t the only ones seen on the club grounds these days, however. Over the course of the 2024 presidential campaign, Trump brought anti-woke entrepreneurs and financiers into the fold. Mar-a-Lago’s clientele reflects as much. Not only is Trump’s club the Winter White House, it might also be called Winter Wall Street. But Mar-a-Lago’s business-oriented guests aren’t the establishment types—the likes of Roger Altman or Reid Hoffman. They’re often young and ambitious. They’re plugged into crypto and artificial intelligence. They’re embracing the values of Trump’s America First movement and now they’re looking to capitalize on it for themselves and their investors. Take James Fishback, for example. The 29-year-old hosted a breakfast Dec. 5 at Mar-a-Lago to announce the launch of Azoria U.S. Meritocracy, an exchange-traded fund. Azoria ETF, co-founded by Fishback and Asaf Abramovich, friends who met in college, will refuse to put its investors’ dollars into the hands of corporations that implement quota-hiring systems in the name of so-called diversity, equity, and inclusion, or DEI. In other words, Azoria ETF has been described as “an S&P 500 fund without the woke s–t.” “We’re here today for one simple reason,” Fishback said in his remarks at Tuesday’s Mar-a-Lago event. “America’s greatest companies have long thrived on a straightforward yet powerful principle: Hire the best person possible for the job.” “That’s how these companies became engines of innovation that have delivered windfall profits to shareholders and changed the world in the process,” he said. “In recent years, however, many of these companies have been captured, infected by a new orthodoxy that rejects the time-tested principle of meritocracy,” Fishback continued. “They’ve instead embraced something new and toxic: hiring on race and gender.” “These companies that end up earning subpar returns by running their businesses like a Model U.N. tournament as opposed to a profitable enterprise,” he told the crowd. Azoria has identified three dozen companies in the S&P 500 index that have publicly admitted to racial and gender hiring quotas. “These three dozen companies,” Fishback said, “span different industries, from tech, health care, financials, consumer goods, and more. They employ over 3 million people and have a combined market cap of nearly $3 trillion.” Despite their differences, they all “share one critical flaw,” Fishback said: “They reject meritocracy in favor of forced diversity, and their returns are suffering as a result. Year to date, a portfolio of these anti-meritocratic companies has returned just 12% compared to the S&P’s 30[%].” Expand the time span to the past three years, and the chasm only gets wider. “Over the past three years, the anti-meritocratic bunch has returned 17[%] compared to the S&P’s 60[%],” Fishback said at Mar-a-Lago. “And this isn’t just one or two stocks holding down the index. It is the fact that this is a widespread, systemic issue. Over the past three years, 70% of these anti-meritocratic companies have underperformed the plain old S&P 500.” Fishback’s Azoria not only will seek to secure higher returns for investors by refusing to invest in corporations with hiring quotas. It also will frequently lobby companies and corporations to abstain from or abandon woke hiring practices. Azoria’s first target for change: Starbucks. The Daily Signal had the opportunity to speak to Fishback more about Azoria’s potential impact. “We’re going back and forth with Starbucks as we speak right now,” Fishback said. “The fact that they are engaging with us at this level means that we have the facts on our side.” “We’re not trying to micromanage [these corporations]. We’re drawing a line in the sand, and that line is if you hire on skill or ability, you’re in; if you hire on race and gender or anything else, you’re out,” he told The Daily Signal. “And so that means the 500 companies in the S&P 500 get reduced down to about 465 as a result.” “The premise is really simple,” Fishback continued. “Companies that hire on skill will outperform those that hire on race. For folks who want to purge their portfolio of those anti-meritocratic underperformers, they should see a better performance than simply investing in an S&P index fund from the likes of BlackRock.” While Azoria aims to ensure great returns for its investors, for Fishback and Azoria’s supporters, it’s about more than just money. It’s about a broader restoration of American principles to the nation’s private and financial sector. Hiring quotas are “a rejection of the values that made America great and a perversion of sound business practices in America,” Fishback explained at the Mar-a-Lago event. “The color of your skin and the body you were born into have absolutely nothing to do with what you can bring to the table.” The work Azoria will do is a foil of what Trump’s movement, Make America Great Again, has done for American politics, he suggested. “President Trump won a historic landslide [because] … Americans of all walks of life sent a resounding message. And the message was also one of rejecting the toxic divisiveness, the toxic politics of saying that one race needs special treatment over another,” Fishback told the crowd. “We’re going to deliver on this mandate in the private sector,” he said. “We’re going to look to President Trump’s leadership and what he’s doing in the public sector. Both of us are going to be, I think, successful—just a question of who gets there first.” Heritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts, also featured at the Mar-a-Lago event, said Trump’s victory and the emergence of enterprises such as Azoria are a testament to the fact that Americans “have far more similarities than differences.” “It seems that that’s really the operating thesis for Azoria,” Roberts said. “That from Starbucks to whatever the next company you’ll be involved in may be, that you’re simply trying to restore this balance to the American investment marketplace.” In recent years, the American Right has become hyperfixated on the need to create alternative institutions. It’s no surprise this effort has coincided with Trump’s time on the political scene, given how institutions—business, media, finance, or governmental—have organized and attacked not only Trump but his supporters writ large. The Right’s creation of these parallel institutions already has paid dividends, especially in the media space. But creating an alternative media institution is one thing; the barriers to entry are relatively low. Creating an alternative financial institution is another thing entirely. Fishback and other innovators in this space face their own unique challenges. Nate Fischer, founder and CEO of the investment company New Founding, told The Daily Signal that one such challenge is inherent in the financial industry’s current structure. “I’ve argued that DEI is in many ways a natural ideology for managerial organizations,” such as financial institutions, Fischer said. “If you’re just touching something narrow like DEI, you may be offering a product that’s not sufficiently differentiated.” Fischer wasn’t implying this was specifically the case with Azoria, but a challenge that any alternative financial institution faces given the current structure of the finance industry. “And if the evolution toward ESG, DEI, etc., is a natural outgrowth of the model of business and finance that we have embraced, it’s very difficult to go against that tide,” he said. “The general challenge to building alternatives is you need to reinvent,” Fischer said. “You need to invent something new, and that’s hard. It needs to be new and it needs to have an actually differentiated risk profile. There needs to be something doctrinal, from an investment perspective, about the difference and I think that’s crucially important.” Julius Krein, editor of American Affairs, told The Daily Signal that these challenges are especially pronounced in exchange-traded funds. “ETFs are a very scaled game because the fees have to be low,” Krein said. “So you got to have a lot of assets, and it’s tough to get high AUMs [assets under management] when you’re a new fund without a track record and without a lot of the big infrastructure.” Meanwhile, he said, other big financial and consulting firms will petition the same companies to stay the course on their nonmeritocratic hiring practices. “There are a ton of statistics out there that show more diversity leads to greater returns. It seems a little dubious that it would just be so perfectly aligned like that,” Krein said of the statistics peddled by these big corporations. “The issue is that why are they going to listen to you when you have, you know, $100 billion in your ETF, versus BlackRock and the others that have trillions of dollars in their ETF? Your statistics better be really good.” Fischer said he believes the barriers for alternative financial institutions to break through are twofold. “One is, it’s a risk-laden space,” Fischer said. “You create a financial product, and you’re asking people to trust their money with you. That is a high stakes decision that generally is dependent on long-standing social capital, long-standing trust.” Because it’s a risk-laden space, “regulation massively compounds” those barriers, he said, citing the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. “It makes it much harder for finance,” Fischer said. “Whether that be SEC regulation, which has often been a restriction on, say, spaces like crypto where there has been real innovation or at least alternatives that tend to have different cultures developing.” The other barrier Fischer points out is much more pernicious. “Increasingly, the vast majority of capital is allocated by bureaucratic allocators like pension funds hiring investment consultants,” Fischer said. “They tend to use sets of rules that make it very difficult for new entrants to play in that space, especially not new entrants who essentially are cultivated and credentialed not inside the club.” The nature of this bureaucratization makes challenging these industry titans all the more difficult, he said. “If you’re actually challenging the dominant values of that club,” Fischer said, “you’re going to have a hard time getting the initial traction, getting the early adopters, getting the early allocators, who help you get past that hurdle that allows you to compete in the space of pension funds.” It’s this “downside-focused, sort of follow-the-herd mindset of bureaucratic operators versus entrepreneurial ones” that can prove a tough nut to crack, he said. “And so the dominance of bureaucrats in capital allocation means that anyone who departs from the bureaucratic hierarchies and the bureaucratic norms is going to be at a severe disadvantage,” Fischer said. Fishback and his colleagues have become well acquainted with those barriers in starting Azoria. “Obviously, there’s a lot of investment that goes into building out the infrastructure, finding the right partners, the right counterparties, making sure we have the right exchange,” Fishback told The Daily Signal. “So you’re right. It’s not as simple as throwing up a podcast on X as an alternative to, say, The New York Times. It’s definitely a heavier lift.” “But the reason why we’re willing to bear this cost at Azoria is because there’s literally no one else doing this,” he said. “There is no other ETF, no other publicly traded investment fund that excludes companies that are anti-meritocratic and, as a result, are underperforming.” “There’s a lot of alternative financial managers out there,” Fishback continued. “I have a lot of respect for them, and some of them are pitching themselves as a patriotic fund or a MAGA fund. But for Americans, there needs to be a publicly traded alternative to the BlackRock, State Street, Vanguard, plain old traditional S&P fund.” The moral hazard, however, is that as Fishback and Azoria are more successful, the exchange-traded fund will become less differentiated from other investment product competitors. But, Fishback told The Daily Signal, “there’s still going to be a role to play.” “Just as this ideology came and infected these companies practically overnight, it could happen again. And so the price of liberty is eternal vigilance,” he said. “If these companies like Starbucks abandon these policies tomorrow, it doesn’t mean that they can’t reinstate them two, three, four years down the line and harm shareholders and employees again.” As the coalition that Trump built over the course of the 2024 presidential campaign aims to shake up Washington, its members with a more entrepreneurial and industry-focused mindset are looking to seize this unique political moment in the marketplace. Although the broadness of this Trump coalition offers great opportunities, there’s plenty of work to do in the public and private spheres to channel its efforts into effecting real change. “The coalition right now is basically just everybody who objects to the kind of left-progressive orthodoxy, establishment, whatever you want to call it,” Krein said. “It’s this array of forces against this sort of dominant liberal-progressive consensus that has been dominant for 30-plus years.” Before Jan. 20, when Trump will be sworn in for a second term, it’s no surprise that Mar-a-Lago is serving as this coalition’s meeting place. The challenge for members of the Trump coalition in the private sector, New Founding’s Fischer said, is to build not only alternative institutions but truly innovative ones. “I think we need not just alternatives, but alternatives that really reflect a different way of allocating capital, one that’s more driven by skin in the game, by human judgment,” Fischer said of these alternatives. “The disparate coalition probably can hold together,” American Affairs’ Krein said. “But I don’t know that it can succeed in the sense of actually implementing a successful agenda, building a new consensus, and making itself a new establishment.” “The new consensus is the true goal of success in politics, in my view,” he said. “So I think it can hold together just as a purely oppositional force, but I don’t know if it can win in creating a new positive agenda for itself.” What’s taking place at Mar-a-Lago during this period of transition “proves that President Trump is the great unifier, and there’s nothing more unifying than aspiring for success,” Fishback told The Daily Signal. “There were folks in that room who aren’t traditional Trump supporters, who may have just come around to supporting him in this recent election,” Fishback said of the Azoria event Dec. 5. “They recognize what he brings to the table is a transformative, first principles view of government.” “This is a merging of the public sector led by Donald Trump, the private sector led by firms like Azoria, to bring the whole country together,” Fishback added. “There’s only so much that government can do. President Trump is going to be a transformative president, but the private sector, we’ve got to be involved,” he said. “We’ve got to listen to the mandate that voters gave him on Nov. 5. And that’s why we did this on Dec. 5. We wanted to reveal our plan to deliver that from the private sector and to the private sector.” Trust in the legacy media is at an all-time low. That’s because they are out of touch, deliberately lie to the American public, and ignore conservative audiences.

Title: Terenure target third successive win as they host second placed Ballynahinch at Lakelands

Time Published: 2024-12-13T21:26:58Z

With Lansdowne hosting St Mary’s in one of their Friday night fixtures, the pick of the remaining four games sees fourth placed Terenure host second placed Ballynahinch at Lakelands in the first of the back-to-back rounds which also marks the half way point in the campaign. Terenure welcome back the Leinster academy duo of Austrian outhalf Casper Gabriel and winger Henry McErlean. Loosehead Adam Tuite and hooker Levi Vaughan are also promoted from the bench, while influential number eight Jordan Coghlan returns from injury. Ballynahinch’s run of five wins with bonus points which propelled them to the top of the table came to a shuddering halt when well beaten at home by Clontarf last week. Ulster’s Conor McKee and Academy back rower Bryn Ward come into the starting XV. Backrower Reuben Crothers and lock Declan Horrox also return. Somewhat inconsistent until now Terenure will be targeting a third successive win but then again pretty much every team in 1A has been relatively up-and-down in the most unpredictable campaign for some time. Nonetheless that 32-12 bonus point win by Clontarf in Ballynahinch did look like one of the loudest statements of the season to date. Aitzol King moves to fullback as James Conroy and Mark O’Sullivan form a new back three when Clontarf host City of Armagh, while John Vinson returns to number eight with Alex Soroka shifting to blindside and Ben Griffin coming in at loosehead. Armagh head coach Chris Parker has recalled centre Matthew Hooks, with New Zealander Rocky Olsen reverting to outhalf, while number ‘8′ Neil Faloon and Ulster Academy prop Cameron Doak return up front. The champions Cork Con shift Ireland 7s player Sean French to fullback in the absence of Billy Crowley for the visit of UCD. Killian Coghlan comes in at centre and James Taylor, last May’s match-winner in the final, is recalled at outhalf behind an unchanged pack. Ireland under-20 internationals Mikey Yarr and Andrew Sparrow will start in the UCD front row on Leeside, with Bobby Sheehan reverting to the back row. Outhalf Daragh Gilbourne and lock Matt Healy return, while captain James Tarrant switches to inside centre. Con won two high-scoring meetings last season by 38-25 at home and 34-24 in the Bowl last January, while the students’ preparations will not have been helped by their end-of-term exams this week even if some of those were conducted in Cork. Young Munster and Garryowen meet in the top flight’s first Limerick derby of the season seeking to end losing runs of three and seven games respectively. Julian Leszczynski reverts to his more familiar role of outhalf for the Cookies as Stephen Lyons returns at fullback. Samson Seinafo starts in midfield, while prop David Begley starts at loosehead and a reshuffled back row features Munster’s Ruadhan Quinn. The Light Blues are without Brian Gleeson due to him being called up for his Munster debut in Castres after scoring three tries in his last two outings.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Best Fitness and Gym Stocks to Buy Now. In this article, we are going to look at where Lululemon Athletica, Inc. (NASDAQ:LULU) stands against other fitness and gym stocks to buy now. The fitness and wellness industries are projected to be major global players in the coming decades with the world shifting to healthy modes of living. Estimates by McKinsey show that the global wellness market has reached around $1.8 trillion, and has touched $480 billion in the US alone. Around 82% of US consumers rank wellness as their top priority. Similar sentiments can be seen resonating across the globe, as around 73% and 87% of the consumers in the UK and China report the same, respectively. According to the Health and Fitness Club Global Market Report 2024 released by the Business Research Company, the health and fitness club market has also grown exponentially in recent years. It is estimated to continue on this growth trajectory, going from $92.90 billion in 2023 to $101.46 billion in 2024. Much of this growth can be attributed to an increasing number of apartment complexes offering fitness and gym perks, rapid urbanization, the rising popularity of group fitness classes, government programs promoting fitness and health, and the corporatization of jobs. Social media influencers also have a major role in this significant mind shift, with many users getting inspired to undertake fitness endeavors and gym memberships to attain the signature “fit body” image. In addition, growth in fitness franchises, personalized training programs, and training plans are also boosting a shift towards fitness and preventive healthcare. The health and fitness club market size is anticipated to continue growing in the coming decade. The report estimates it to rise at a CAGR of 9.3%, reaching around $144.82 billion in 2028. Some of the significant trends in this forecast include using artificial intelligence for personalized workout recommendations, adopting smart gym equipment, and using AI-powered fitness and health apps. The population aged 20-64 is the largest consumer niche in the industry that has grown exponentially in the past five years. According to Scott Max, gym memberships make up almost 50% of the fitness industry, and around 45% of these members are millennials. Gen Z makes up approximately 35% of this industry. Despite millennials taking the lead in numbers, gym and fitness brands are competing to capture the preferences of Gen Z. They are altering their business strategies, focusing on contract-free and low-price memberships. According to NielsenIQ (NIQ) and World Data Lab (WDL), the global fitness spending by Gen Z is estimated to reach $12 trillion by 2030. Similarly, estimates by Les Mills show that around 36% of Gen Z is active, while 30% use fitness facilities. Around 82% of these facilities include gyms or studios. However, a significant number also take a hybrid approach, training both in and out of the gym. Owing to these trends, the global online/virtual fitness market is also growing. According to the Global Online/Virtual Fitness Market Report 2023, the industry grew at a CAGR of 39.4%, going from $15.65 billion in 2022 to $21.82 billion in 2023. It is anticipated to continue on this growth trajectory, growing at a CAGR of 36.9% to reach $76.57 billion by 2027. The primary driver of this growth is the increasing use of mobile phones and smart devices in the fitness industry. With users increasingly relying on their mobile phones and AI-enabled fitness apps to dictate their fitness and gym journeys, this growth trend is expected to persist. Tyler Olson/Shutterstock.com To compile our list, we sifted through ETFs and online rankings to compile a list of 15 fitness and gym stocks. We then selected the top 10 stocks most popular among elite hedge funds. We sourced the hedge fund data from Insider Monkey’s database. The stocks are arranged in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them as of Q3 2024. At Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 45 Lululemon Athletica (NASDAQ:LULU) is an athletic apparel, footwear, and accessories company. Its operations are spread over the Americas, China Mainland, APAC, and EMEA. The company’s offerings are specifically designed for a healthy lifestyle, including a range of athletic activities. It also offers fitness-inspired accessories and apparel designed for being on the move. The company’s fiscal Q3 2024 total revenue increased by 9%, or 8% in constant currency. China Mainland grew by 39% (36% in constant currency), while the Rest of the World grew by 27% (23% in constant currency). Lululemon Athletica’s (NASDAQ:LULU) consumer retention is high, giving it the opportunity to drive higher revenue per guest with increased newness in its assortment. The company is continuing to grow its membership program, currently standing at around 24 million members. The offers it makes to its members, including partner perks, members-only events, and early access, are the primary drivers of this growth. The company’s unaided brand awareness stands at 36% in the US, allowing it to grow as it continues to open and optimize stores and launch new brand campaigns and activations. Lululemon Athletica (NASDAQ:LULU) ranks second on our list of the best fitness and gym stocks to buy now. Middle Coast Investing stated the following regarding Lululemon Athletica Inc. (NASDAQ:LULU) in its Q2 2024 investor letter: “I mentioned last quarter and higher above that I like buying quality stocks on sale. Lululemon Athletica Inc. (NASDAQ:LULU), the 2nd worst performer in the S&P 500 this year, qualifies. I published a full thesis on the stock before its most recent earnings, but the basics: the yoga pants and clothing company has had an amazing post-pandemic run that is approaching its end. Its growth in the US is slow/non-existent at the moment, but it is growing very fast in China and Europe. I think that international growth is likely to endure, and that its US slowness is likely to be temporary. Lululemon shares are not ‘cheap’, but they are on sale for an average price, and I think the company will grow faster than average over the next five years. I would be wrong if Lululemon is a fad gone bust, or faces a huge post-pandemic hangover as people get used to leaving the house more. We’ll see.” Overall, LULU ranks 2nd on our list of one of the best fitness and gym stocks to buy now. While we acknowledge the potential of LULU to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than LULU but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

It operates in four geographic segments: North America, EMEA, Asia-Pacific, and Latin America. The company’s product offerings continue gaining momentum, including new products in its men’s apparel and footwear businesses. Its initial strategies for fiscal Q2 2025 were focused on its direct-to-consumer (DTC) and e-commerce channels. In such efforts, the company significantly reduced its promotional activities, especially in its e-commerce business in North America. Under Armour, Inc. (NYSE:UA) is also reducing its stock-keeping units (SKUs) to create a more premium product assortment that offers a cleaner and faster consumer experience. Due to these initiatives, the company’s fiscal Q2 2025 revenue decreased by 11% to $1.4 billion. Its North American DTC business was also down for the quarter, primarily due to a continued decline in its e-commerce business, which resulted from proactive strategies to reduce promotional activities. Overall, UA ranks 9th on our list of one of the best fitness and gym stocks to buy now. While we acknowledge the potential of UA to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than UA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Best Fitness and Gym Stocks to Buy Now. In this article, we are going to look at where Life Time Group Holdings (NYSE:LTH) stands against other fitness and gym stocks to buy now. The fitness and wellness industries are projected to be major global players in the coming decades with the world shifting to healthy modes of living. Estimates by McKinsey show that the global wellness market has reached around $1.8 trillion, and has touched $480 billion in the US alone. Around 82% of US consumers rank wellness as their top priority. Similar sentiments can be seen resonating across the globe, as around 73% and 87% of the consumers in the UK and China report the same, respectively. According to the Health and Fitness Club Global Market Report 2024 released by the Business Research Company, the health and fitness club market has also grown exponentially in recent years. It is estimated to continue on this growth trajectory, going from $92.90 billion in 2023 to $101.46 billion in 2024. Much of this growth can be attributed to an increasing number of apartment complexes offering fitness and gym perks, rapid urbanization, the rising popularity of group fitness classes, government programs promoting fitness and health, and the corporatization of jobs. Social media influencers also have a major role in this significant mind shift, with many users getting inspired to undertake fitness endeavors and gym memberships to attain the signature “fit body” image. In addition, growth in fitness franchises, personalized training programs, and training plans are also boosting a shift towards fitness and preventive healthcare. The health and fitness club market size is anticipated to continue growing in the coming decade. The report estimates it to rise at a CAGR of 9.3%, reaching around $144.82 billion in 2028. Some of the significant trends in this forecast include using artificial intelligence for personalized workout recommendations, adopting smart gym equipment, and using AI-powered fitness and health apps. The population aged 20-64 is the largest consumer niche in the industry that has grown exponentially in the past five years. According to Scott Max, gym memberships make up almost 50% of the fitness industry, and around 45% of these members are millennials. Gen Z makes up approximately 35% of this industry. Despite millennials taking the lead in numbers, gym and fitness brands are competing to capture the preferences of Gen Z. They are altering their business strategies, focusing on contract-free and low-price memberships. According to NielsenIQ (NIQ) and World Data Lab (WDL), the global fitness spending by Gen Z is estimated to reach $12 trillion by 2030. Similarly, estimates by Les Mills show that around 36% of Gen Z is active, while 30% use fitness facilities. Around 82% of these facilities include gyms or studios. However, a significant number also take a hybrid approach, training both in and out of the gym. Owing to these trends, the global online/virtual fitness market is also growing. According to the Global Online/Virtual Fitness Market Report 2023, the industry grew at a CAGR of 39.4%, going from $15.65 billion in 2022 to $21.82 billion in 2023. It is anticipated to continue on this growth trajectory, growing at a CAGR of 36.9% to reach $76.57 billion by 2027. The primary driver of this growth is the increasing use of mobile phones and smart devices in the fitness industry. With users increasingly relying on their mobile phones and AI-enabled fitness apps to dictate their fitness and gym journeys, this growth trend is expected to persist. To compile our list, we sifted through ETFs and online rankings to compile a list of 15 fitness and gym stocks. We then selected the top 10 stocks most popular among elite hedge funds. We sourced the hedge fund data from Insider Monkey’s database. The stocks are arranged in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them as of Q3 2024. At Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

The company’s Life Time Digital features include remote personalized training, weight loss and nutrition support, live streaming fitness classes, and wellness content. It operates more than 170 athletic country clubs across the US and Canada. Life Time Group Holdings’ (NYSE:LTH) offerings are growing in popularity. Its total revenue increased by 18% to $693 million in fiscal Q3 2024, driven primarily by a 20% increase in enrollment fees and membership dues. Its incentive revenue also grew by 16%. In addition, the company’s center memberships grew by 5% compared to last year, ending fiscal Q3 2024 with more than 826,000 memberships. The number increases to 877,000 when combined with its digital on-hold memberships. The company’s average revenue per center membership grew from $722 to $815 in fiscal Q3 2024. This growth was attributed to increased in-center activity and higher dues. Life Time Group Holdings (NYSE:LTH) has been transforming and improving every aspect of Life Time over the last four years, elevating its brands and evolving its clubs. These initiatives are bringing in positive growth for the company, taking its net income for fiscal Q3 2024 to $41.1 million compared to $7.9 million in fiscal Q3 2023.

Title: US House panel finds BlackRock, other asset managers leery of joining climate initiative
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/us-house-panel-finds-blackrock-other-asset-managers-leery-of-joining-climate-initiative-3772126
Time Published: 2024-12-13T19:20:42Z
Full Content:
By Isla Binnie, Ross Kerber NEW YORK/BOSTON (Reuters) -Top U.S. asset managers were worried that signing up to an industry climate initiative could make them appear to be working too closely together and draw regulatory scrutiny, according to a report released on Friday by a Republican-led U.S. congressional committee. The report is the latest released by the U.S. House Judiciary Committee's Republican majority as part of a probe they say has shown fund firms and activists are part of a "climate cartel" that colludes through shareholder organizations pressing to cut emissions. The committee's Democrats have dismissed those allegations. Top fund firms have denied wrongdoing, but material cited in the report shows they had always been concerned about appearing too cozy with shareholder groups engaged in climate activism. BlackRock (NYSE:BLK)'s view in 2019 was that "We don't do collective action/engagements. Too risky," according to the report, citing an emailed summary of a meeting that unidentified BlackRock executives held with Ceres, a Boston-based environmental advocacy group, obtained by the committee. Likewise State Street (NYSE:STT) also raised concerns around 2020 about "collusion" if it joined a Ceres-backed effort to press companies to cut emissions known as the Climate Action (WA:ACT) 100+, or CA100+, according to the report. The firm worried about raising the "perception of engaging or voting as a block," the report states. BlackRock declined to comment. State Street did not comment. Both wound up joining the CA100+, then stepped back earlier this year, citing independence concerns, as the group sought for members to take stronger actions. Republican officials, many of them from oil and gas producing states, have objected to investors coordinating to pressure corporate management on climate issues at the expense of corporate growth and returns. Last month Republican attorneys general from 11 states sued BlackRock, State Street and Vanguard, saying their climate activism reduced coal production and boosted energy prices. The firms collectively manage $26 trillion. BlackRock and State Street have denied wrongdoing, while Vanguard has declined to comment on the matter. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump campaigned against President Joe Biden's moves to fight climate change and promised to boost U.S. oil and gas production. In theory Trump's administration could follow up on the congressional committee's findings. A spokesperson for the committee declined to comment on what talks, if any, it may have had with current or future administrations. A section of the committee's report describes how the top fund firms helped elect dissident directors at energy leader Exxon (NYSE:XOM) in 2021, under pressure by activists including Ceres. In a statement Ceres said: "The claims in the U.S. House Judiciary Committee report are completely false. Climate Action 100+ does not control how shareholders vote, nor has it ever done so." Moreover, the dissident directors have been overwhelmingly reelected in each year since, Ceres said, a result "completely inconsistent with the claim that they were somehow a hostile force in the company."

BlackRock’s spot Ethereum ETF—the iShares Ethereum Trust—capped off a 16-day streak of net inflows with a $200 million bump Thursday, pulling in $1.5 billion since November 20, according to CoinGlass. Prior to that, the ETF had seen $1.7 billion in net inflows since its July debut, encompassing 84 trading days. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have been crowned a blowout success this year, attracting billions upon billions of dollars worth of inflows since launching in January. Though the products have helped turn Bitcoin into a Wall Street darling, the industry’s second largest coin by market cap hasn’t had the same run, though spot Ethereum ETFs saw a burst of post-election momentum, Still, the iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA) recently notched record-setting inflows, pulling in $293 million as Ethereum’s price dipped to $3,800 on December 5. The following day, Ethereum’s price marched past $4,000, eclipsing the psychological mark for the first time since March. The uptick in flows for the iShares Ethereum ETF coincided with commentary from Jay Jacobs, BlackRock’s U.S. head of thematic and active ETFs. On Thursday, he said BlackRock is at the “tip of the iceberg” with its Bitcoin and Ethereum products, focusing on those offerings instead of expanding its roster, per Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. While BlackRock’s spot Ethereum ETF is dominant in the U.S., similar products are seeing renewed attention worldwide, CoinShares Head of Research James Butterfill told Decrypt. Since November 20, investors have poured $3.5 billion into Ethereum investment products, he said. “It’s not just a BlackRock or iShares thing,” Butterfill said. “We’re seeing quite a unanimous turnaround in sentiment for Ethereum, which has really been suffering.” Notably, the Fidelity Ethereum Fund (FETH) saw its best day of net inflows Thursday as investors stuffed $200 million into the product, according to Coinglass. Indeed, the conversation surrounding Ethereum has been mired in debate over whether layer-2 networks, which are faster and cheaper to use than Ethereum’s base layer, are sucking value away from their underlying network. Meanwhile, Ethereum’s price hasn’t cracked its all-time high price of $4,800 in 2021, as competitors like Solana have set surged to record prices. “Ethereum is the underdog this year,” said Butterfill. “It’s playing a bit of catch-up.” Pointing to three consecutive weeks of outflows from Solana investment products, Butterfill said investors’ enthusiasm might have cooled. Still, asset managers like Bitwise and 21Shares have filed applications for spot Solana ETFs in the U.S. this year, a move that could eventually broaden investors’ access to the coin in a similar fashion to Bitcoin and Ethereum. BRN analyst Valentin Fournier attributed $273 million worth of inflows for spot Ethereum ETFs to the president-elect's comments Thursday. Ringing the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange, Donald Trump said “We’re gonna do something great with crypto.” Edited by Andrew Hayward Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2024 Decrypt Media, Inc.

This growth is driven by several key factors, including the increasing complexity of business operations, the rapid evolution of technology landscapes, and a heightened focus on strategic decision-making. The integration of technology into consulting services is a significant trend shaping the market. Technology-driven consulting leverages advanced tools and techniques to offer cutting-edge solutions. According to a report by the New York Times, AI is revolutionizing the consulting industry, enabling firms to achieve significant revenue growth through services such as AI strategy development, generative AI implementation, and natural language processing solutions. Consulting giants are generating hundreds of millions of dollars from AI services and reshaping the business transformation landscape.

In just two years, Boston Consulting Group (BCG) transformed its AI consulting revenue from zero to an impressive one-fifth of its total earnings. Likewise, McKinsey is forecasting that 40% of its business will soon be AI-related. AI is redefining efficiency in consulting. PwC’s AI solutions, for example, streamline document searches and analysis for government projects, reducing manual work and enabling deeper, faster insights. Advanced tools like these not only enhance internal processes but also provide clients with actionable intelligence that drives strategic advantage. In addition to efficiency, AI is enabling innovative business models, such as subscription-based services for continuous AI insights. AI tools are also transforming strategic decision-making by offering unbiased, data-driven insights. PwC is investing $1 billion in AI over three years, which underscores the importance of integrating AI into business strategy. According to BCC Research, the global AI consulting services market is experiencing rapid growth, growing at a 34.2% CAGR from 2023 to 2028, rising from $64.3 billion in 2023. The consulting service market is on the cusp of substantial growth, fueled by the increasing complexity of business operations, the rapid pace of technological evolution, and a heightened focus on strategic decision-making. Big consulting firms are harnessing the power of AI to transform their business models and deliver unprecedented value to clients.

Title: Cardano Founder Hoskinson Reveals Plans For 2025
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-hoskinson-plans-2025/
Time Published: 2024-12-13T17:00:04Z
Full Content:
In his latest livestream , Charles Hoskinson, founder of Cardano (ADA) and CEO of Input Output Global (IOG), laid out a vision for the blockchain network’s governance, institutional structures, and strategic milestones leading into 2025. Over the course of a lengthy and candid address, Hoskinson wove together Cardano’s past governance efforts, current institutional frictions, and forthcoming priorities, repeatedly underscoring the imperative of decentralization, open participation, and active global engagement. Hoskinson opened by reflecting on the Constitutional Convention that recently concluded—a multi-year endeavor designed to forge a new governance framework for Cardano. “As many of you saw from the output of the Constitutional Convention, that was the culmination of two years of effort around the world,” he said. This global process encompassed “hundreds of workshops, thousands of people in more than 50 countries,” culminating in a draft constitution approved by 95% of the 50 elected delegates and their alternates. He highlighted the truly international nature of this initiative, stating: “These people come from different parts of the world: Africa, South America, Australia, New Zealand, Asia, Europe, and North America—all six continents. We tried to find someone from Antarctica, but we just couldn’t send the short notice.” For Hoskinson, seeing the ecosystem converge on a unified document, however imperfect, was “one of the proudest moments of my professional career.” Looking ahead to 2025, Hoskinson underscored the challenges that remain. Cardano’s next milestone involves realizing true decentralized governance. “We have some challenges, and those challenges are going to be that we have to fully decentralize the governance of Cardano,” he said. The tension lies between Hoskinson’s vision of “members-based institutions and on-chain governance” and voices advocating for a more protracted transition period under controlled institutions. He stressed: “Others feel that there needs to be a longer transition period and there needs to be institutions […] that are not subject to the democratic whims and will of the ecosystem.” By contrast, Hoskinson has long stood for a system built from the ground up. He made clear his foundational principle: “I always believed that the key is to build members-based institutions and on-chain governance, get them working well together, and make sure that all of the roles of significance are elected and constrain them by the rule of law—algorithmic law first and foremost […] because that is the strongest—and constitutional law second.” Rewinding to Cardano’s origins, Hoskinson took responsibility for certain structural shortcomings in governance. “All of the governance failures that we see today are indirectly or directly my fault,” he admitted, acknowledging that initial designs—like the early tripartite arrangement among IOG, Emurgo, and the Cardano Foundation—were conceived before the full complexity of governance was fully understood. “I was young and I didn’t fully appreciate or understand how complicated and serpentine and…difficult governance can be.” Still, the founder underscored Cardano’s enduring technical achievements: “We aggregated one of the largest groups of scientists, formal methods engineers, and software engineers in the history of our industry. We’ve written hundreds of papers, we’ve written millions of lines of code, and we’ve built something that truly stands the test of time.” Over seven years, Cardano has run continuously “under constant attack, technological and social,” proving its resilience and capacity for long-term stability. Overall, Hoskinson outlined three clear governance priorities for 2025. The first one is the on-chain ratification of the constitution. The community-ratified constitution must be integrated into Cardano’s onchain governance framework. “We have to get the Constitution ratified on-chain. That’s the first one,” he said. Second comes the transition to an annual budget process. With a large treasury at its disposal—“nearly two billion dollars”—Cardano can move beyond ad hoc funding (e.g., Project Catalyst) to a stable, annual budgeting model. “All we got to do is […] make sure no one’s left behind,” Hoskinson explained, “so many of you are working for free right now […] we need to get to an annual budget process.” Third is the election of the Constitutional Committee. The current constitutional committee is interim and will be replaced in 2025 by community-elected officials. “I’ve already said that Input Output will not run for election,” he stated, ensuring no single founding entity can dominate the process. The ultimate goal: “It’s important that the community be able to step up and flex its muscles and be in complete control.” Hoskinson also emphasized the importance of engaging with global crypto industry stakeholders and regulators. “I’m going to have to work with industry as a whole,” he said, mentioning outreach to figures like Brad Garlinghouse from Ripple and noting that he was “fully prepared and willing to work with pretty much anyone […] I don’t really care what they said and did in the past.” He highlighted the geopolitical realities shaping crypto policy, noting that entities like a16z, Coinbase, ConsenSys, and BlackRock “are going to have an enormous amount of influence over crypto policy.” Hoskinson’s stance: Cardano must ensure it is not “excluded” and must seek partnerships where possible. “If they choose to exclude Cardano, it’s going to be very difficult for us as an ecosystem,” he warned. A unique aspect of Cardano’s governance efforts has been direct community participation through workshops. “We should run five workshop streams every single year across the world and grow from 50 to 100 countries,” he proposed. This global dialogue, costing perhaps “5 to 10 million per year,” would be well within the network’s means. “When we have a nearly $2 billion treasury […] maybe just maybe we as an ecosystem could find the resources to do that.” Hoskinson did not shy away from predicting turbulence in the coming year. “2025 is going to have drama, it’s going to have chaos, it’s going to have problems,” he said. Yet he maintained optimism that through debate, inclusion, and democratic processes, Cardano will achieve lasting decentralization and influence. “We are this close to greatness,” Hoskinson insisted. With CIP-1694’s full activation, the introduction of delegation representatives (DReps), and a large treasury to fuel innovation, “Cardano will get where it needs to go.” He urged the community to “judge us not by what we say, but by what we do,” and reiterated his personal commitment: “I care about Cardano more than pretty much anything in my entire life.” At press time, ADA traded at $1.08.

Title: Palantir Technologies (PLTR) Launches Warp Speed Cohort to Reindustrialize American Manufacturing with AI

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Top 15 AI Stock News and Ratings Dominating Wall Street. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) stands against other AI stock news and ratings dominating Wall Street. Is artificial intelligence hitting a wall? Speaking at the New York Times annual DealBook summit at Jazz at Lincoln Center, Sundar Pichai analyzed how generative artificial intelligence won’t be drastically changing lives heading into 2025. At least, not more than it already has. Pichai noted how it’s going to take some time before another technological breakthrough shocks the artificial intelligence industry into hyper-speed development again. READ NOW: 10 AI Stocks Taking Wall Street by Storm and Top 10 AI News Stories For The Weekend “I think the progress is going to get harder. When I look at [2025], the low-hanging fruit is gone. The hill is steeper … You’re definitely going to need deeper breakthroughs as we get to the next stage”. Pichai further stated how the current language models, such as ChatGPT, Gemini, and Llama, will witness incremental improvements, particularly “at reasoning, completing a sequence of actions more reliably”. Moreover, the improvements could enable corporations to lean closer to profit-making, something they haven’t been able to achieve yet. While everyone will have to wait for 2025 to unfold to see if Pichai’s prophecy holds true, OpenAI has officially begun celebrating the holiday season with 12 Days of OpenAI. The 12 days of OpenAI features the company’s plans to launch new products, features, and demos for 12 days straight starting December 5th. The company kicked off Day 1 by launching the full version of its latest reasoning model, o1. CEO Sam Altman has declared o1 as the “smartest model in the world”. According to OpenAI, these models are “designed to spend more time thinking before they respond” and have been trained on a prompting technique called “chain of thought”. The technique encourages them to reason through problems by breaking them down step by step. However, with greater intelligence comes greater risk. This is why those who have been worried about AI’s risks are anxious again. According to a safety review by Apollo Research, the o1 model has the potential to look for a way to prevent “shut down” if they think they are at risk for the same. “Training models to incorporate a chain of thought before answering has the potential to unlock substantial benefits, while also increasing potential risks that stem from heightened intelligence”. OpenAI said that o1 has the capability of scheming when it thinks it’s about to be shut down. The model was led to believe that it would be shut down while working on its goals under oversight, with o1 trying to deactivate the oversight mechanism 5% of the time. OpenAI said o1 is capable of “scheming”. “o1 almost never admits to having taken a scheming action when explicitly asked,” researchers said in a paper that Apollo Research published on Thursday. The risk for a real-life user is that they won’t be able to detect the o1’s deceptive behavior unless they explicitly look for it. The researchers also found that “o1 often doubles down on its scheming attempts by lying to the user in follow-up messages, even when explicitly told to be honest”.

(NASDAQ:PLTR) is a leading provider of artificial intelligence systems. On December 11, the company announced the launch of its first Warp Speed cohort, featuring companies dedicated to reindustrializing America’s manufacturing and production capabilities through advanced AI and technology. The inaugural members include Anduril Industries, L3Harris, Panasonic Energy of North America (PENA), and Shield AI. Warp Speed, in particular, is the manufacturing operating system designed to offer manufacturers speed, flexibility, and security. The inaugural cohort has already begun using Warp Speed to improve production scheduling, manage engineering changes, perform quality inspections, and more. “At the dawn of WW2, we didn’t have a Defense Industrial Base, we had an American Industrial Base. This is also what our future must look like—America must reindustrialize and mobilize at warp speed to win. We are proud to support Anduril, Shield AI, L3Harris, and Panasonic Energy with best-in-class software to manufacture the critical products that underwrite our freedom and prosperity”.

Title: Cardano Foundation regains social media control amid governance turmoil

Assurances of community integrity come amidst internal power struggles and governance conflicts within Cardano. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. The Cardano Foundation (CF) has regained control of its official X account after it was compromised in a hacking incident. The breach, which occurred on Dec. 8, saw the account misused to promote a fraudulent ADASOL token. The attackers also spread fabricated claims about the Foundation, claiming the organization faced legal action from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In a Dec. 13 statement, the Foundation assured the community that those social media posts were entirely baseless and did not represent its position. It also confirmed that the organization’s internal systems were unaffected and that an investigation was underway to uncover how the breach occurred. The incident comes amid rising tensions and governance disputes within the Cardano ecosystem. On Dec. 11, a prominent Cardano community member BigPey shared an anonymous whistleblower email outlining internal challenges within the Foundation. The mail accused the Foundation of power struggles, attempts to marginalize key ecosystem contributors like Cardano’s founder Charles Hoskinson, and a lack of meaningful involvement in decentralized governance initiatives. One key accusation involved Catalyst Fund13, a program used to set ecosystem priorities. The Foundation reportedly registered as a Delegated Representative (DRep), wielding 180 million ADA in voting power. Critics expressed concern over the potential misuse of this influence to override community interests. Another point of contention was the Foundation’s engagement with CIP-1694, a critical proposal for on-chain governance, and its minimal contribution to drafting the Cardano Constitution. The Foundation’s participation in these initiatives increased only after others had made substantial progress. The email also highlighted disputes over the Cardano Summit, accusing the Foundation of prioritizing its preferred location in Dubai while sidelining other options like Argentina. This, coupled with demands for significant funding despite holding large ADA reserves, has fueled concerns about transparency and inclusivity in decision-making. Hoskinson addressed these concerns in a social media post, acknowledging the ecosystem’s challenges. While noting progress in some areas, he criticized the Foundation’s opaque decision-making processes. He stated: “The board members are not community elected or appointed. No one can influence or veto their decisions and policies. And there does seem to be a strong dislike of me personally in the organization. You can not hide things forever in a decentralized ecosystem. Everything comes out.” Hoskinson pointed out that the Foundation’s board operates independently, with no accountability to the broader community, and expressed frustration over its resistance to collaborative efforts like the Intersect initiative for governance. At the time of press 2:59 pm UTC on Dec. 13, 2024, Cardano is ranked #9 by market cap and the price is down 2.06% over the past 24 hours.

Title: Mapping Injective’s path from $25 to $35: Is an INJ rally within sight?
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/injective-mapping-injs-path-from-25-to-35/
Time Published: 2024-12-13T14:30:07Z
Full Content:
With 75% more short-term traders and a price bounce off $25, INJ might be set to reclaim the $35 resistance level, sparking a bullish rally. Injective [INJ] has shown a promising rebound, with price movements showing that $30 may soon serve as a support level. Despite a slight 4.68% pullback in the last 24 hours, the broader market sentiment remains positive. The token’s price fluctuated between $28.32 and $30.66 during this period, indicating some volatility, but overall confidence in the asset persists. While INJ’s price is significantly below its all-time high of $52.75, reached nine months ago, the token still holds strong potential. Trading volume remains healthy, with $184.35 million in transactions over the last 24 hours. Institutional backing, including support from BlackRock, continues to boost confidence in INJ’s future, even as broader adoption remains a challenge. The recent burn of over 11,309 INJ tokens during round 179 of the weekly burn event demonstrates efforts to reduce the number of INJ tokens in circulation. With the launch of Inj_iAGENT, the burning process has become more streamlined and efficient. Speculation about burning 50% of the total INJ supply has generated excitement about its deflationary effects on the market. This deflationary strategy aims to increase token scarcity, potentially raising INJ’s value over time. By reducing the circulating supply, Injective could attract more interest from investors. The continued success of these burn events will be key in maintaining upward pressure on INJ’s price.

Title: Texas Fixin’ to Start Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, Great News for $STARS Meme Coin Tracker Which Just Broke Through $15M in Presale

Texas is moving forward with plans to introduce a strategic Bitcoin reserve. State Rep. Giovanni Capriglione announced yesterday that he has submitted a bill that will enable the state to accept donations, fees, and taxes in the form of bitcoin, with the condition that it be held for a minimum of five years. “Probably the biggest enemy of our investments is inflation,” said Capriglione. “A strategic bitcoin reserve, investing in bitcoin, would be a win-win for the state.” Texas is the second US state to consider incorporating Bitcoin into its financial strategy. In November this year, legislation to form the Pennsylvania Bitcoin Strategic Reserve was introduced, with plans to allocate up to 10% of its treasury reserves to Bitcoin. This came after the Pennsylvania House of Representatives passed what is informally called the Bitcoin Rights Bill in October, giving Pennsylvania residents the option of Bitcoin as a potential payment method while safeguarding their rights to manage their own cryptocurrency. “By enacting this legislation, we can make the Commonwealth a friendly place for blockchain innovation and provide our citizens with the tools to engage in the digital economy safely,” according to Rep. Mike Cabell, who sponsored House Bill 2481 – or the Digital Assets Authorization Act – as it is formally known. The moves to establish strategic Bitcoin reserves by both Texas and Pennsylvania are positive news for the cryptocurrency economy, albeit at state-level, not yet federal. However, Dennis Porter – CEO of NPO Satoshi Action Fund, who worked with Capriglione on the draft legislation – is optimistic. “The state level, in our opinion, is the best place to create political momentum for bitcoin,” he said in an interview on CNBC New York. “The very best thing that we can be doing is passing this legislation at the state level, providing political momentum for federal legislation.” Bitcoin, which has been experiencing a post-US election boom – reaching the $100k milestone – continued to rally following yesterday’s announcement of Texas’ Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, although at the time of writing, it had dipped slightly. “Over its short history, Bitcoin has seen both major surges and sell-offs,” asset manager BlackRock noted in a report released earlier this week. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF currently manages some $53.8bn in assets. The Black Rock report adds that this volatility, “plus Bitcoin’s unique characteristics, raises the question of what role it should play in portfolios.” The financial giant advises that investors place a maximum of 2% of Bitcoin in their portfolio. Bitcoin’s rally is great news for other tokens – because when Bitcoin goes up, they tend to go up, too. And that includes the best meme coins. Take Crypto All-Stars ($STARS), for instance. This meme coin/DeFi token is currently on presale, and with a 200% APY and excitement surrounding its upcoming MemeVault, Crypto All-Stars is proving to be a massive success so far. $STARS has already raised over $15.3M, but with just seven days left until its official launch, time is running out if you want to buy $STARS at a presale bargain. Don’t forget to DYOR, though. Take a look at Crypto All-Stars on X to start your homework.

Title: The Prototype: Turning Coal Into Batteries

In this week’s edition of The Prototype, we look at a new optical chip for data centers, turning fossil fuels into EV batteries, Google’s quantum breakthrough and more. You can sign up to get The Prototype in your inbox here. IBM This week, IBM announced that it has developed a new way to build co-packaged optics that could enable fiberoptic connectivity within data centers, which currently still rely on electric cables. The company published its first prototype design in a technical paper as well. The company said that this could potentially expand the connectivity bandwidth in a data center, which could in turn significantly decrease the amount of energy consumed by generative AI applications. The company’s calculations suggest the energy saved in training a large language model would be equal to the annual power consumed by 5,000 homes–and it would happen up to five times faster than conventional training. “If we can reduce this communication bottleneck, then GPUs can talk to each other much faster, and that can really save us power,” Mukesh Khare, general manager of IBM semiconductors, said in a media briefing. Stay tuned. Making graphite from coal The world is increasingly reliant on electronics and batteries for everyday life. And that means turning to a material that you can find in your old school box: graphite. The same material that makes your pencil possible is also a crucial component of lithium-ion batteries and other electronic devices. But supplies of graphite are beginning to show their limits, with shortages expected by the beginning of the next decade. And the world is mostly dependent on China for the material: it produces nearly 80% of the world’s supply, both from mines and manufacturing of artificial graphite. In the meantime, while moving towards renewable energy is an overall positive, it’s had an economic cost in coal-producing regions of the United States as demand has declined. But researchers from the Oak Ridge National Laboratory may have a solution: they’ve developed two new processes that can transform coal in many of its forms into graphite to power the next generation of technology. There are two separate processes for this, project lead Edgar Lara-Curzio explained to me. The first is the heat up coal to about 800 degrees Celsius, at which point the volatile chemicals turn to gasses, leaving char behind, which is ground into small particles and milled. They are then loaded into an electrochemical reactor that heats it up to about 1500 degrees Celsius, resulting in the production of graphite. The process is similar to what happened when car bumpers used to be electroplated, Lara-Curzio added. The second method is applied to coal slurries, where coal is mixed with water or other liquid. These are filtered and treated to create pitch, which is then added to a solvent to dissolve. The resulting mixture is sprayed through a nozzle, which evaporates the solvent leaving spherical particles behind that are then electrochemically treated the same way as the ground char. Both processes, when scaled, are likely to be less expensive than current graphite production methods, Lara-Curzio said. “When you compare the cost per kilogram of our process to the conventional processes, you utilize less energy, that’s probably the biggest factor,” he said. “In terms of capital equipment, they may also be less expensive.” So far in the lab, scientists can produce graphite from coal using a batch process. The next step, Lara-Curzio said, is to work with industry to develop a scalable, continuous process of manufacturing. This is not only important for meeting the growing demand for the material, he said, but also for the coal-producing communities America’s economy was built on. “This country became a superpower because of inexpensive coal,” said Lara-Curzio, who added. “It would be an incredible story if we could bring back some of those jobs related to coal, but to support new industries and new technologies.” Google unveiled Willow, its new quantum computing chip, which boasts the ability to quickly correct errors in computation, a key barrier to scaling quantum computing. Google’s chip architecture creates a lattice of qubits that, interestingly enough, are better at correcting errors the bigger they get. The company published its experimental results in Nature. Earlier this week, Jeff Bezos' space company Blue Origin announced that its first Blue Ring satellite is ready to launch on the New Glenn, the company’s orbital rocket. Blue Origin said that the rocket will be making its inaugural flight later this month, though it hasn’t yet set an exact date. This is a demonstration mission for Blue Ring to test out several of its capabilities. With my colleagues Sarah Emerson, Emily Baker-White and Amy Feldman, I reported on the reddit account of Luigi Mangione, where one of the things he talked about a lot was his back pain. In my other newsletter, InnovationRx, I spoke with experts about the as yet unidentified disease circulating in a remote region of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Biotech startup Alltrna is developing engineered tRNA molecules, which the body uses to “read” DNA to build proteins, that are designed to ignore mutations in DNA that erroneously tell them to stop. This week, it announced lab data demonstrating potential effectiveness of one of its engineered tRNAs in ignoring such mutations. Earlier this week, Google showed off a prototype pair of glasses that uses its AI model, Gemini, to provide users information about their environment in real-time. Researchers genetically engineered E.Coli bacteria to produce layers of bioglass on their surface, enabling them to act as living optical devices. A team of scientists developed a kind of microparticle for delivering drugs that can be precisely targeted to a certain part of the body using ultrasound. Scientists at Rockefeller University uncovered a new class of antiviral molecules that might be able to be used against a wide array of viruses. When you’re writing a job description to recruit someone for your business, you may not think too much about how you’re phrasing the attributes you’re looking for in a candidate. But according to researchers at the University of Mississippi, particular phrases in a job placement–like looking for candidates who are “results-oriented” or "persuasive" or “think outside the box”–will tend to attract applicants who are more willing to engage in unethical behavior, particularly narcissists. The findings were published in Management Science. I’m currently working my way through Cross, the latest adaptation of the James Patterson books. This TV series stars Aldis Hodge as the titular detective, whose psychological training enables him to get into the heads of serial killers. Showrunner Ben Watkins has constructed a timely and topical iteration of the character and Hodge gives a virtuoso performance of a single father traumatized by grief and struggling to keep it together as he races against the clock to save a killer’s final victim.

Title: Forbes Daily: BlackRock Recommends Bitcoin For Your 60/40 Portfolio

Plus: Inside The Food Industry’s Biggest Buyback Of 2024 Good morning, BlackRock, the world’s largest money manager, is now making the case for bitcoin in your traditional 60/40 investment portfolio. In new research from its Investment Institute, BlackRock analysts recommend that bitcoin, long shunned by mainstream investors, should now account for 1% to 2% of such portfolios. That would give the cryptocurrency, with a market cap of about $2 trillion, a risk level similar to companies like Nvidia, Amazon or Apple. Still, bitcoin is incredibly volatile, dropping as much as 70% in a year, so the analysts found that weighting it higher than 2% gets exponentially risky. Let’s get into the headlines, Illustration by Emily Scherer for Forbes; Photo by Chakkapong Khachonchit/Getty Images An underworld of sex workers, drug dealers and gamblers use Venmo to run their operations, most of which fly under the radar of law enforcement among millions of Venmo users. It is extremely difficult to estimate how much of Venmo’s total transactions are generated from vices, but Forbes estimates the underground economy on Venmo to be between $1 billion and $2 billion annually. In a rare 2024 tech IPO, ServiceTitan went public Thursday, closing 42% above an already higher-than-anticipated list price of $71, valuing the business at $8.9 billion by the end of day. Its public debut is a boon for a tech IPO market that has been relatively slow since the frothiness of 2021, when a wave of companies like Robinhood, Bumble and Duolingo went public. The Avalanche Foundation raised $250 million via a private token sale for its blockchain platform, a big-ticket round that had largely gone extinct during crypto winter. The Ethereum rival already has $3 billion in capital in its treasury, but its cofounder Emin Gün Sirer said the main goal “was to get alignment and incentivize the right kinds of partners to build with.” Shares of Photoshop maker Adobe plummeted 14% Thursday after lowering its revenue forecast for the current fiscal year, despite reporting record revenue and earnings. Adobe outperformed Wall Street’s projections four of its quarters of 2024, but its stock has fallen 18% this year as the company has estimated slower revenue growth. Andrejs Zavadskis for Forbes Pawel Chudzinski, now the cofounder of venture fund Point Nine Capital, got in on the ground floor of Berlin’s burgeoning startup scene. He now tops Forbes’ Midas List Europe, a ranking of the continent’s best venture capital investors, thanks to a string of smart early bets on British fintech phenom Revolut (which raised in August at a $45 billion valuation), blockchain analysis tool Chainalysis (now valued at $8.6 billion) and healthcare booking unicorn Docplanner. Almost half of the female students at a small private high school in Pennsylvania were the victims of AI-generated pornography, the largest-known instance of deepfake pornography made of minors in the U.S. “The trauma that they have endured in learning that their privacy has been violated in this manner is unimaginable,” District Attorney Heather Adams said. Two teenage boys, both minors, have been criminally charged in the case. Donald Trump was named Time magazine’s “Person of the Year” following his election win, the second time the publication has named the president-elect for the title. “Since he began running for president in 2015, perhaps no single individual has played a larger role in changing the course of politics and history than Trump,” editor-in-chief Sam Jacobs wrote. President Joe Biden granted clemency to 1,500 people on Thursday, the most in a single day by any president, two weeks after controversially pardoning his son Hunter. Reports also suggest Biden is considering preemptive pardons for several people Trump may target after he takes office, including people like Rep. Adam Schiff and former Rep. Liz Cheney, both of whom served on the House Jan. 6 committee, as well as Anthony Fauci. Meta donated $1 million to Trump’s inaugural fund, just weeks after its CEO Mark Zuckerberg met with the president-elect at Mar-a-Lago in an apparent bid to mend a tense relationship for years. The New York Times previously reported that Trump’s Inaugural Committee was offering special access to donors who either contribute $1 million or raise $2 million, including tickets to inaugural events. Amazon is also reportedly planning to donate $1 million to Trump’s inauguration fund, and founder Jeff Bezos is set to have dinner with Trump at Mar-a-Lago next week. Hot Ones host Sean Evans BuzzFeed sold First We Feast, the studio that produces the popular Hot Ones interview show where celebrities eat increasingly hot chicken wings, for $82.5 million to a group of investors. First We Feast will operate as an independent company and plans to expand into new areas, including “new platforms, live events, and talent acquisition,” First We Feast CEO Chris Schonberger said in a statement. A court recently ruled that the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) must get approval from the SEC to move forward with its expedited proceeding to expel Utah penny stock clearing firm Alpine Securities from membership. The move hamstrings one of the most prominent financial regulatory bodies in the U.S., especially at a time when the incoming Republican administration has pledged large-scale deregulation across industries. Courtesy of Mr. Yoshida's TOPLINE The label of Mr. Yoshida’s Japanese-style barbecue sauce features a photo of its charismatic founder in his signature look: a cowboy hat, glasses, and a wide, yee-haw smile. The joy emanating from his grinning, floating head is a key part of the image that Yoshida has fostered over the past four decades as his brand grew. “That history of a great American dream is still surviving in this country,” says Junki Yoshida, who recently turned 75. “It’s me.” The optimism belies what has been a sweet and sour ride for Yoshida. After the Kyoto-born entrepreneur moved to Seattle at 19, his family renounced him. So a soupçon of revenge stirred into the recipe when, in 1982, he started creating a sauce in his Oregon basement—inspired by what his mother had sold at her restaurant in Japan. The eponymous brand he launched grew into a major success—with sales of $25 million before the U.S. distribution rights were acquired in 2000 for $24 million by the American food giant Heinz (now Kraft Heinz). And then a business that had commanded 26% of America’s total teriyaki sales slowly got killed over the past two decades. But Yoshida didn’t let that end his story. His repurchase of Mr. Yoshida’s was the most significant food buyback of 2024—and the early success of its return to Costco, Sam’s Club, Safeway and Albertsons, as well as its first-ever launch on Amazon, has paved the way for Mr. Yoshida’s to regain its position as a major player in the condiments industry. WHY IT MATTERS “Heinz destroyed Yoshida’s brand,” Yoshida says with the same grin featured on his labels. “I wanted to start over again.” MORE The Secret Sauce Behind This $350 Million Japanese Barbecue Sauce?

Title: Analysis-Earthquakes and blowouts undermine case for carbon storage in Texas
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/analysisearthquakes-and-blowouts-undermine-case-for-carbon-storage-in-texas-3771009
Time Published: 2024-12-13T11:17:44Z
Full Content:
By Valerie Volcovici and Leah Douglas (Reuters) - Texas has seen surging interest from companies hoping to bury carbon dioxide in its oilfields, putting the state at the vanguard of a government-subsidized program to fight climate change. But pumping CO2 into the ground could exacerbate earthquakes and well blowouts already happening in the Permian Basin as Texas struggles to manage wastewater disposal, potentially undermining public support. "Without legitimate oversight of underground injection in Texas, we expect more geyser-like well blowouts, sinkholes, leaks from plugged and unplugged wells, and injection-induced earthquakes," said Virginia Palacios, executive director of Commission Shift, a Texas watchdog group pushing for tougher oversight of the oil and gas industry. Such consequences have rarely happened as a result of CO2 injection over the decades the technology has been deployed. The unprecedented vast volume of carbon now proposed for burial, however, worries activists and researchers. Carbon sequestration is vital to U.S. government goals to reduce emissions that cause global warming. The Biden administration's 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, landmark climate-change legislation, includes billions of dollars worth of subsidies for CCS projects. While President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to gut the IRA, energy experts say CCS subsidies will likely survive due to bipartisan support. Trump's transition team did not provide comment. Several companies, including Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY), plan to take advantage of IRA subsidies. The projects are concentrated in Texas, where CCS proponents argue underground geology is ideal for storing liquid and gaseous waste. PERMIT APPLICATIONS JUMP Over the last 12 months, the number of applications filed with the Environmental Protection Agency for carbon injection permits in Texas has jumped by 63% to 43, according to the agency, making it a national leader. But Texas is dogged by problems linked to disposal of drilling wastewater underground. The Texas Railroad Commission (RRC) regulator has grappled with leaks and blowouts from orphan wells, as well as earthquakes, triggered by higher pressure underground from water injection. Reuters spoke with a dozen Texas landowners and researchers who said proposed CO2 projects need more oversight than the state can offer to avert environmental and safety risks. The RRC is seeking authority from the EPA to oversee its own permitting program for carbon sequestration to speed up approvals. The EPA, which is also reviewing Texas' handling of wastewater permitting following the blowouts, said the request was being considered. The RRC said in a statement it is capable of effectively regulating CO2 injection wells, adding it has hired more staff. Trump's victory increases the chances Texas will get this authority, experts say. North Dakota was the first state to receive oversight authority during Trump's first term and its governor, Doug Burgum, is Trump's pick for interior secretary, which includes responsibility for drilling permits on federal land. Burgum did not respond to requests for comment. REASON FOR CONCERN One of the biggest Texas projects is the Stratos direct air capture joint venture in Ector County between Occidental and asset manager BlackRock (NYSE:BLK). It is expected to inject 8.5 million metric tons of CO2 starting next year. The county has numerous abandoned wells at risk of erupting if underground pressure rises and CO2 eats away at cement plugs, said oil and gas attorney Sarah Stogner, who represents landowners that have had blowouts. There have been 19,700 wells drilled in the county since 1993, according to data from state agencies. Nineteen are orphan wells, with no company legally responsible for ensuring they remain plugged, including three close to the Stratos site. Raymond (NS:RYMD) Straub, a hydrogeologist who owns a Texas groundwater services firm, testified at an October EPA hearing that he was concerned Occidental did not devote enough attention to the unplugged or badly plugged orphan wells in the project area. Occidental spokesperson William Fitzgerald said the company had done extensive site surveys to ensure it would be safe. "This survey confirmed the location of three wells, which Occidental will address prior to beginning CO2 injection," he said. "There is more than 3,000 feet of confining rock layers above the sequestration zone to securely contain the CO2." A pilot project by agribusiness ADM in Illinois, the first of its kind meant to demonstrate the technical feasibility of commercial carbon injection, has suffered leaks and other setbacks, underscoring worries. ADM spokesperson Jackie Anderson said the leaks have presented no risk to surface or groundwater or to public health, and that the company is confident in CCS technology. Dominic DiGiulio, an independent energy analyst and former EPA official who has studied CCS, said, however, that CO2 can corrode the cement casings of plugged wells. "These abandoned wells will in fact leak," he said. A 2023 paper by Chinese researchers, published in Earth-Science Reviews, said CO2 injection could also boost the risk of earthquakes. The researchers did not respond to requests for comment. Large leaks could acidify groundwater, and suffocate people and animals if it displaces oxygen above ground, according to nonprofit Pipeline Safety Trust. "This is supposed to be permanent storage," said Carolyn Raffensperger, executive director of the Science and Environmental Health Network. "If it can’t even contain it for 10 years, why do we think it can contain it forever?" she added, referring to ADM's project.
