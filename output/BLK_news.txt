Title: Ethereum Market Outlook: $4,100 Resistance Holds as BlackRock and Major Funds Boost Exposure

After two weeks of a disappointing run, Ethereum (ETH) is once again capturing institutional interest as major funds and asset managers step into the smart-contract platform. According to recent data, Bitmine Immersion Technologies purchased approximately $251 million worth of ETH, adding 63,539 tokens to its portfolio and bringing its holdings to over 3 million ETH ($13 billion). BlackRock’s clients have added $41.91 million in Ethereum, marking another sign of growing institutional adoption. These inflows come as Ethereum breaks out of a descending trendline pattern and parallels the rally seen in gold, with ETH’s correlation to gold reaching 0.7 in Q3 2025, driven by ETF inflows and DeFi-driven growth. On-chain metrics further reinforce this accumulation narrative. Wallets are moving more ETH off exchanges, signaling long-term holding behavior, while tokenization and DeFi usage on Ethereum’s network continue to expand meaningfully. Institutions appear to be treating Ethereum not just as a speculative bet, but increasingly as a foundational infrastructure asset, particularly given Ethereum’s post-Proof-of-Stake upgrade energy efficiency and suitability for ESG mandates. From a technical vantage, Ethereum is testing the key resistance zone near $4,100–$4,440. Analysts like Ali Martinez point out the recent breakout of the descending trendline provides a bullish structural shift, but only if support levels remain intact. The most critical support lies near $3,800, with a deeper fallback to $3,600 if momentum fades. A sustained move above $4,440 could unlock a run toward $4,800–$5,000, provided institutional flows and macro conditions align. Conversely, a close below $3,800 would weaken the momentum thesis and potentially invite a retracement toward $3,560 or lower. With ETF flows, macro liquidity, and network fundamentals converging, Ethereum is showing a rare blend of structural strength, but execution is key. The near-term jury is out until Ethereum closes decisively above $4,100 with volume confirming the move.

Massive Job Displacement: Amazon plans to replace 600,000 workers with AI-driven robots, signaling a broader economic shift as China, Tesla, and Boston Dynamics accelerate automation, risking an $18 trillion consumer debt collapse. Economic Collapse Looms: Analysts predict hyperinflation, bank failures, and currency devaluation surpassing the 2008 crisis, with Universal Basic Income (UBI) failing to prevent homelessness and AI-driven governance sparking civil unrest. Vaccine Forensics Exposes Corruption: Brighteon.AI unveils an uncensored AI tool citing medical literature to expose Big Pharmaâs rigged trials, CDC/FDA collusion, and suppression of safer alternatives like natural immunity and detox protocols. Financial & Societal Breakdown: Gold, silver, and Bitcoin may be the only stable assets as fiat currencies hyperinflate, corporate landlords seize foreclosed homes, and AI-driven law enforcement enforces digital dystopia. Survival Strategies: Adams urges converting savings into gold/silver or crypto, avoiding UBI traps tied to compliance mandates, and building self-sufficient communities through off-grid homesteading and decentralized trade networks.

The Automation Tsunami Leaked documents confirm Amazonâs staggering plan to replace 600,000 human workers with AI-driven robots and autonomous systems within the next few yearsâa harbinger of a broader economic catastrophe. Analysts warn this trend, accelerated by Chinaâs mass-production of humanoid robots by 2025 and advancements from Tesla and Boston Dynamics, will trigger an $18 trillion consumer debt collapse as displaced workers default on mortgages, loans, and credit cards. The 2008 financial crisis will pale in comparison. Hyperinflation, bank failures, and currency devaluation loom as governments scramble to bail out institutions drowning in bad debt. Mike Adams, founder of Brighteon.com, warns of a "Mad Max 2030" scenarioâwhere Universal Basic Income (UBI) fails to offset skyrocketing costs, homelessness surges, and AI-driven governance replaces human institutions, sparking violent clashes between the jobless and the machines that replaced them. The AI Truth Wars Amidst the chaos, Brighteon.AI unveils a revolutionary tool: Vaccine Forensicsâan uncensored, citation-backed AI engine exposing Big Pharmaâs decades of deception on vaccines, mRNA technology, and regulatory capture. Unlike mainstream AI models prone to "hallucinating" sources, this system pulls direct excerpts from medical literature, historical documents, and peer-reviewed studies, proving: Pharmaceutical corruption and rigged clinical trials Suppression of safer alternatives (natural immunity, detox protocols) CDC/FDA collusion with industry lobbyists This tool empowers researchers to demand transparency in an era where informed consent is under siegeâwhile offline, decentralized models resist Big Tech manipulation. The Great Unraveling The convergence of AI-driven job eradication, financial collapse, and institutional distrust paints a dire forecast: Gold, silver, and Bitcoin may be the only stable assets as fiat currencies hyperinflate. Housing markets implode as corporate landlords (BlackRock) seize foreclosed properties. AI judges and cops enforce digital dystopia, while governments deploy robots to crush dissent. Medical truth remains a battleground, with alternative research tools like Vaccine Forensics offering a lifeline against censorship. Survival in the New Economy Adams urges proactive measures: Exit fiat currency: Convert savings into physical gold/silver or decentralized crypto. Prepare for UBI traps: Digital handouts will come with compliance mandates (vaccines, social credit). Build self-sufficient communities: Off-grid homesteading, permaculture, and decentralized trade networks. Conclusion The storm is here. The globalist agendaâdepopulation, digital enslavement, and AI-driven controlâis accelerating. But tools like Brighteon.AI and grassroots resilience offer a path to truth, freedom, and survival. As Adams warns: "When people lose everything, they lose it." The time to act is now.

Title: The Great Democratization: Why Your Pension Deserves Bitcoin

For decades, the investment elite have enjoyed a secret: alternative assets deliver superior returns. While ordinary Americans watched their 401(k)s stagnate in index funds, endowments and sovereign wealth funds quietly reaped gains from private equity, venture capital, and—lately—digital assets. President Trump’s Executive Order 14330, “Democratizing Access to Alternative Assets for 401(k) Investors” (Aug. 7, 2025), finally tears down that wall, giving working Americans the same opportunities long hoarded by the wealthy. Leveling the Field The reform works on three levels: federal directive, state legislation, and congressional codification. At the federal level, Trump’s order directed the Department of Labor to lift Biden-era restrictions that effectively banned cryptocurrencies from retirement accounts under the guise of “extreme care.” States responded swiftly. Arizona, New Hampshire, and Texas legalized modest Bitcoin allocations in early 2025. North Carolina proposed allowing up to five percent of its $127 billion retirement fund—$6.35 billion—to flow into Bitcoin ETFs. Michigan already holds $11.4 million in Bitcoin exposure, and Wisconsin disclosed $164 million in spot ETF holdings. Florida’s House Bill 183, filed for the 2026 session, is the boldest initiative yet. It would authorize the State CFO to invest up to 10 percent of public funds—including the $218 billion Florida Retirement System Trust Fund—in digital assets. Even a 1 percent allocation would add $2.2 billion to Bitcoin markets; 5 percent would exceed $11 billion. The bill imposes strict custody and compliance requirements, limiting holdings to qualified custodians or SEC-registered ETFs. It cites Trump’s earlier Executive Order 14233 establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, defining Bitcoin as a store of value and inflation hedge. In Congress, Rep. Troy Downing’s Retirement Investment Choice Act seeks to codify the reform permanently, shielding it from future reversals. Senate Republicans are pressing for regulatory safe harbors to protect plan sponsors. Critics decry “speculation,” ignoring that institutions have owned crypto for years. Harvard, Yale, and Stanford invested in digital assets long ago; Michigan and Wisconsin pension funds now follow. The paternalism that deems Harvard’s allocation “prudent” but a Kentucky teacher’s “reckless” is indefensible. Oklahoma lawmakers estimated that a five-percent Bitcoin allocation would have yielded $750 million in just five months—reducing pension liabilities without costing taxpayers. Macroeconomic Realism The macro case is simple: the old rules no longer apply. The 60/40 stock-bond portfolio worked when inflation was tame and rates predictable. Since Nixon abandoned gold in 1971, the dollar has lost nearly 90 percent of its purchasing power. Pension funds invested solely in dollar assets are slowly boiling away their value. Bitcoin offers scarcity and independence from central banks. Its fixed supply of 21 million coins provides what fiat currency cannot—certainty against dilution. While the Fed prints trillions, no government can mint more Bitcoin. For funds managing decades of liabilities, that scarcity is protection. Since 2015, Bitcoin has appreciated over 15,000 percent. Even accounting for volatility, its risk-adjusted returns beat every traditional asset over ten years. With BlackRock, Fidelity, and other giants now offering Bitcoin products, the real question is why ordinary savers were barred from this asset class for so long. Monetary Sovereignty and Stability Cryptocurrency is not rebellion but evolution. The Fed’s monopoly on money creation produced asset bubbles, the 2008 crisis, and inflation that punishes savers. Bitcoin provides a decentralized system where no bureaucracy can rewrite the rules. For pensions, diversification across uncorrelated assets enhances stability. Bitcoin’s movements have low correlation with equities, particularly during inflation shocks. When the dollar weakens, Bitcoin often rises—the hedge long-term portfolios need. The 2022 “crypto winter,” endlessly cited by skeptics, was followed by a recovery that rewarded patient holders. Pension funds, with multi-decade horizons, are ideally suited to absorb short-term volatility. Integrating crypto also secures America’s leadership in digital finance. China has its digital yuan; Europe experiments with a digital euro. If U.S. pensions remain confined to 20th-century assets while others advance on blockchain rails, America risks obsolescence. Trump’s order ensures American savers, not foreign innovators, benefit from U.S. financial ingenuity. The Geopolitical Dimension The dollar’s supremacy is not eternal. Its strength rests on faith in U.S. institutions and the dollar’s global utility. Endless deficits and monetary expansion corrode both. Bitcoin, a neutral and borderless asset, is becoming a global reserve hedge. Far from undermining American power, adopting Bitcoin reinforces it. The U.S. still commands the deepest capital markets and most advanced financial infrastructure. Keeping Bitcoin innovation under American jurisdiction ensures it strengthens, not weakens, the national system. Trump’s Strategic Bitcoin Reserve mirrors the role gold once played at Fort Knox: a signal of monetary credibility in the digital age. Vermont’s proposed ban on pension crypto holdings shows the opposite impulse—fear masquerading as prudence. Dismissing Bitcoin as “too young” recalls those who once said the same about equities or the internet. Pension funds that avoided technology stocks in the 1990s underperformed disastrously; those that shun digital assets now will repeat the mistake. The Path Forward Trump’s order does not compel investment; it restores fiduciary discretion. The three-tier system—federal deregulation, state empowerment, congressional codification—forms a durable structure resistant to political shifts. Florida’s plan exemplifies best practice: a 10 percent ceiling, strict custody rules, ETF channels, and explicit recognition of Bitcoin as an inflation hedge. As Brian Graff of the American Retirement Association notes, “Professional fiduciaries—not the federal government—are best placed to decide what serves participants’ interests.” Maintaining the status quo is the true recklessness. States like Kentucky and Oklahoma face massive pension shortfalls. With traditional assets underperforming, fiduciaries must seek alternatives. Crypto offers return, diversification, and protection against monetary debasement—the very goals of responsible investment. Volatility fears are outdated. Institutional adoption and regulatory clarity have stabilized markets, and Bitcoin’s swings have narrowed as liquidity deepens. For pensions with long horizons, near-term fluctuations are noise; long-term appreciation is the signal. The democratization of alternative assets is overdue justice. For too long, working Americans were excluded from wealth-building strategies reserved for elites. Trump’s reforms end this financial apartheid. Every worker deserves access to the same instruments that enriched universities and sovereign funds. If pension funds buying Bitcoin seems radical, the real radicalism was denying citizens the chance to protect their savings. In an age of monetary erosion, Bitcoin is not speculation—it is self-defense. Extending that protection to every American is what democratic capitalism should mean. Fortune favors the brave; poverty rewards the timid. Bepi Pezzulli is a Solicitor in England & Wales and an Avvocato in Italy. He is a foreign-policy scholar, a member of Advance UK’s College, and a councillor of the Great British PAC. He tweets @bepipezzulli. Image: Free image, Pixabay license.

Rowe Price on Wednesday applied for a mixed digital asset exchange-traded fund, according to a regulatory filing, its first in the crypto space as it joined a growing list of traditional finance firms that have proposed token-focused products. The Baltimore-based firm, which manages $1.77 trillion in assets, said that the T. Rowe Price Active Crypto ETF would hold five to 15 digital assets, including potentially Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana, Dogecoin, Cardano, Avalanche, Shiba Inu, Hedera, Bitcoin Cash, Chainlink, Litecoin, and Polkadot, according to its S-1 prospectus filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Bitcoin and Ethereum, the two largest digital coins by market cap, will have the biggest weighting, according to the application. SEMI-SHOCK: T Rowe Price just filed for an Active Crypto ETF. They are a Top 5 active manager by assets (mostly mutual funds). Did not expect it but I get it. There’s gonna be land rush for this space too. pic.twitter.com/gXbCsll9kG — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) October 22, 2025 "Under normal circumstances, the Fund is expected to hold between five and fifteen crypto assets; however, the Fund may hold more than fifteen or less than five crypto assets at any time," the filing said, adding that the ETF would try to outperform the FTSE Crypto U.S. Listed Index. The application comes as traditional finance firms look to expand their digital asset fund offerings to meet soaring investor demand, a result of the success of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum funds that debuted last year and a friendlier regulatory and political environment. Fidelity, VanEck and ProShares have all proposed Solana funds. This week, ProShares also submitted a proposal for a mixed digital coin fund. Several crypto-focused asset managers are also looking to list ETFs based on altcoins. The SEC is currently weighing more than 90 applications for crypto-focused ETFs. T. Rowe Price told Decrypt that it could not provide information aside from what was in the filing. In January 2024, the SEC approved a slew of Bitcoin ETFs, including funds proposed by BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale. The funds have had the most successful start in the ETF industry's 32-year history and now manage over $150.3 billion in assets. Ethereum funds, approved later in the year, now control about $23 billion in assets, most of those coming in the last four months. The funds have given more traditional investors and some institutions access to the world of crypto via shares that trade on a stock exchange. Previously, investors were discouraged by some aspects of buying digital assets, such as storing digital coins and paying tax on gains.

The 54-page analysis paints an optimistic picture of crypto's trajectory, emphasizing 2025 as the pivotal year for institutional embrace while highlighting surging user growth, technological advancements, and regulatory progress in the U.S. "This is the year the world came on-chain," the authors wrote. With Bitcoin dominating over half the cryptocurrency market cap and stablecoins rivaling global payment giants like Visa in transaction volume, the report argues that crypto is anchoring the modern economy—yet it warns that challenges like privacy, scalability, and AI integration must be addressed to unlock its full potential. That optimism isn't unexpected: Andreessen Horowitz is Silicon Valley's biggest booster, having raised more than $7.6 billion across four funds earmarked for crypto. At the heart of the report is the assertion that crypto's market is "big, global, and growing," driven by cyclical feedback loops between rising prices, developer activity, and user adoption. The total crypto market capitalization has seen dramatic ups and downs, but recently topped $4 billion for the first time ever. And underlying metrics show resilience: monthly active developers have climbed to over 40,000, while mobile wallet users approach 60 million. Bitcoin remains king, holding more than 50% of the global crypto market cap and ranking among top global assets—its value now surpasses companies like Meta and Saudi Aramco, though gold's market cap is still 11 times larger. The report notes Bitcoin's increasing correlation with macro forces, behaving at times like a safe haven (similar to gold) and at others like a risk asset (tracking the Nasdaq). In the report, Andreessen Horowitz dubbed 2025 "the year of institutional adoption." Major financial players are diving in: Circle's market cap exceeded $50 billion earlier this year after a splashy IPO, Robinhood launched its own Arbitrum-based layer-2 blockchain, BlackRock continued expanding its tokenized money-market fund, and Fidelity started testing its own USD-pegged stablecoin. Traditional giants like Stripe, Visa, PayPal, Mastercard, Shopify, JPMorgan, and Morgan Stanley are integrating crypto features, from stablecoin payments to tokenized assets. Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs alone hold over $170 billion in on-chain assets, with BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust holding over $91 billion worth of BTC as of this writing. Meanwhile, publicly traded "treasury companies" now hold billions in crypto reserves—led by Bitcoin giant Strategy with $69 million—signaling a shift toward treating digital assets as core balance-sheet items. Stablecoins emerged as a breakout star, having "gone mainstream" with adjusted transaction volumes hitting $9 trillion over the past year—gaining on ACH ($87 trillion) while dwarfing PayPal ($1.7 trillion). Tether's USDT and Circle's USDC dominate stablecoin supply, primarily on Ethereum and Tron, and stablecoin issuers now rank among the top 20 holders of U.S. Treasuries, ahead of nations like Saudi Arabia and Germany. The report posits that stablecoins could bolster USD dominance amid rising national debt and declining foreign demand for Treasuries, with organic adoption decoupling from speculative trading. Decentralized finance, or DeFi, is expanding, capturing 25% of spot trading volume as users shift from centralized exchanges (CEXs) to decentralized ones (DEXs). Real-world assets (RWAs) like tokenized Treasuries and corporate bonds have reached $30 billion on-chain, bridging traditional finance. Decentralized physical infrastructure network (DePIN) plays are also gaining steam, with projects like Helium generating revenue through user-owned wireless services. Meme coins, with over 13 million different tokens launched in the past year, are framed as a symptom of regulatory gaps, while NFTs evolve from speculation to broad collecting on low-fee chains. Prediction markets, buoyed by post-election traction, are "here to stay," the report claims. The report claimed that crypto infrastructure is "(almost) ready for prime time," processing over 3,400 transactions per second—approaching scales of Nasdaq or credit card networks. Solana stands out as a hub for economic activity, with rising throughput and billions in app revenue, while Ethereum's layer-2 upgrades have driven record volumes at all-time-low fees. Bridges are funneling billions to more robust chains, and zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs are accelerating privacy and scaling. Blockchains are also preparing for quantum threats, with 6.65 million Bitcoin ($717 billion) still at risk from vulnerable addresses. A key convergence is between AI and crypto, with the report arguing that crypto can solve AI's pain points: proving human uniqueness (over 17 million verified on World), enabling agent payments ($30 trillion projected AI-influenced purchases by 2030), tracking IP provenance ($80 trillion in intangible assets), and decentralizing compute (over 420,000 models on Gensyn's network). Since ChatGPT's launch, crypto has seen a talent exodus to AI but net gains from other sectors, fueling a wave of "AI x crypto" startups—now representing 30% of crypto VC deals. AI's power consolidation in Big Tech underscores the need for crypto's decentralization. AI needs identity, payments, and provenance tracking. Crypto provides all three. Together, crypto & AI are shaping a more open internet—one where both money and intelligence move freely. pic.twitter.com/slZvgB0ruj — a16z crypto (@a16zcrypto) October 22, 2025 In America, the industry is "stronger than ever," the firm wrote, thanks to advancing legislation like the GENIUS Act—which President Trump signed into law in July with bipartisan support—and the pending CLARITY Act. Federal agencies are being proactive, too: the DOJ revised crypto prosecution policies, the CFTC clarified that code isn't a crime, and the SEC issued guidance on stablecoins and ETFs. This environment enables tokens to capture revenue directly for holders, the report suggests, closing economic loops with $33 billion in user-paid fees generating $18 billion for projects and $4 billion accruing to tokens. Looking ahead, Andreessen Horowitz forecasts market structure as top policy priority, accelerated stablecoin use strengthening USD, traditional finance doubling down on-chain, infrastructure breakthroughs, and revenue-generating tokens. It also projects AI-crypto innovations addressing internet challenges, a surge in tokenized real-world assets, clearer regulations unlocking developer opportunities, and consumer products onboarding the next wave of users.

Title: Crypto lost 1,000 jobs to AI since ChatGPT launched—but gained them back from other sectors, says a16z report
URL: https://fortune.com/crypto/2025/10/22/andreessen-horowitz-a16z-report-crypto-jobs-ai/
Time Published: 2025-10-22T19:05:11Z
Full Content:
Ever since AI supplanted crypto as the shiny new toy in Silicon Valley, there’s been no shortage of jokes about workers jumping ship. New data from prominent venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (commonly referred to as a16z) shows that the truth is more complicated. In its annual state of crypto report released on Wednesday, a16z found that since the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022, around 1,000 workers left the crypto industry for AI startups. But, in that same time period, blockchain companies gained the same number of employees from other industries, including traditional finance and tech. “People forget that the collapse of FTX and the launch of ChatGPT were less than a month apart”, said Daren Matsuoka, a partner on the crypto investment team at a16z, in an interview with Fortune. “There was a period of time in the crypto industry where it was looking very negative for crypto and very promising for AI.” Today, the outlook for crypto is markedly different than it was in late 2022. AI continues to drive record investment, but crypto has mounted a comeback. The market cap of all cryptocurrencies in circulation has surpassed $4 trillion, and Bitcoin’s value hit new all-time highs this year. The resurgence comes as the Trump administration embraced the sector, pushing for a regulatory thaw and championing legislation in Congress to establish oversight for stablecoins and exchanges. Top financial institutions like JPMorgan, BlackRock, and Fidelity are all expanding their crypto offerings. In its report, a16z found that workers coming into the crypto industry are tending to join from a traditional finance and consulting background, or from emerging fintech companies, another sign that the line is blurring between traditional finance and crypto. “We started doing this report four years ago, when crypto was in its teenage years,” Matsuoka added. “But now the world takes crypto seriously… the industry just got a lot more mature.” This year’s crypto annual crypto report is the fourth of its kind to be published by a16z, which spun out its crypto arm in 2018. Following the spin-off, the entity known as a16z crypto raised staggering funds during an earlier boom era for blockchain, including a $2.2 billion vehicle in 2021 and a $4.5 billion fund in 2022. Led by Chris Dixon, a16z crypto has invested in top startups such as Worldcoin, Uniswap, and Phantom. While the soaring AI industry has dominated tech headlines, a16z crypto’s new report shows that crypto users’ desire for privacy is becoming more pronounced. The firm cites Google searches related to crypto privacy surging in 2025. “It’s a common trope in the industry for people to say users don’t really care about privacy”, said Eddy Lazzarin, a16z crypto’s chief technology officer, in an interview with Fortune. “I personally don’t think that that’s true. I think that people either do or will care.” © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Banks once shunned crypto custody; now they’re racing to tokenize trillions in cash and securities. The quiet rebuild is underway, and it’s happening inside the balance sheets of Goldman, Citi, and BlackRock. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Wall Street’s biggest balance sheets are quietly rebuilding the crypto stack under the banner of tokenization and custody. What began as a defensive stance toward digital assets is turning into an infrastructure shift: bringing fund administration, cash management, and settlement onto blockchain rails that look more like BNY Mellon’s LiquidityDirect platform than a typical crypto exchange. Since late summer, Goldman Sachs and BNY Mellon have taken tokenized money market funds live, Citi has positioned itself as a tokenization agent and custodian on Switzerland’s SDX exchange, and BlackRock has doubled down on the thesis that tokenized funds will eventually sit beside ETFs as a core product line. In the span of a few months, tokenized treasuries have become an $8.3 billion asset class. Broader real-world assets (RWAs) now range between $24 and $30 billion. Yet the real contest isn’t in the numbers; it’s in who will custody the next $100 billion of digital paper and how those assets connect to traditional balance sheets. The first wave of bank entries shows a clear pattern. Goldman and BNY chose the least volatile and most systemically relevant asset they could: money market funds. Money market funds are among the safest and most liquid investment vehicles in traditional finance. They hold short-term government and corporate debt, giving institutions a way to park cash while earning modest yields with minimal risk. Tokenizing them turns those holdings into digital units that can be transferred instantly and settled 24 hours a day. For large institutions, the benefit is not speculative but operational: corporate treasurers can move cash faster, pledge assets as collateral, and reduce the frictions that come with banking cut-off times. Citi’s strategy moves in parallel through private markets. By joining SDX, Citi now provides custody and tokenization services for regulated digital securities, acting as the back-end for issuers experimenting with tokenized bonds or shares. The structure resembles traditional custody, but settlement happens atomically, meaning payment and asset transfer occur simultaneously without intermediaries. BlackRock’s BUIDL fund demonstrates how this can scale. The fund holds tokenized Treasury bills and represents them as programmable tokens. Its assets have grown more than eightfold in 18 months. With total assets at $13.5 trillion and nearly $100 billion of crypto-linked funds, BlackRock has the reach to turn tokenized products into standard portfolio components for institutions. If the early 2020s were about crypto custodians learning compliance, the mid-2020s are about banks learning blockchain. The players are different, but the economics are familiar. Coinbase, Fidelity, and BNY already charge custody fees of roughly 0.05% to 0.15% of the value they hold, depending on client size and risk profile. As tokenized cash and securities become mainstream, these percentages start to resemble the fees charged in fund administration and collateral management, creating an overlap that did not exist before. In this version of tokenization, the appeal is not headline innovation but efficiency. A tokenized Treasury or fund share can move instantly between accounts and settle in real time, cutting costs for both clients and custodians. The conservative outlook for this market sees tokenized Treasuries hovering between $6 billion and $8 billion if regulation slows and yields fall. A middle-ground projection expects around $10-15 billion by mid-2026 as more banks integrate money-market products. The optimistic scenario reaches $25-40 billion if tokenized cash accounts tied to ETFs take off and if banks start testing repo markets for tokenized collateral. Repos are the backbone of short-term lending in finance. Banks lend cash in exchange for safe collateral such as Treasuries, agreeing to reverse the trade later. Tokenized repos would allow these transactions to settle automatically on a blockchain, reducing the operational delays and counterparty risk that currently require expensive intermediaries. That collateral link is what turns tokenization from a bookkeeping experiment into real financial plumbing. Goldman and BNY’s tokenized money-market shares already move within closed, permissioned environments. The next question is whether those tokens can move across custodians safely. The joint Project Guardian initiative between the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority and Singapore’s Monetary Authority is testing that exact idea: shared standards for verifying compliance across public and private blockchains. If the project succeeds, 2026 could bring the first bank-to-bank repo transactions executed entirely with tokenized assets. Today’s systems still operate inside walled gardens. Networks such as Goldman’s GS DAP, SDX, and JPMorgan’s Onyx offer efficiency at the cost of interoperability. Regulators prefer this model because every participant is known and verified, but financial institutions are beginning to explore how permissioned systems might connect to public networks through cryptographic proofs that preserve compliance. If that link is established, custody fees could expand toward $300–600 million in annual revenue, assuming tokenized cash and Treasury products reach $25–40 billion in assets and charge service fees near 0.1–0.15%. Regulation will decide how fast this happens. In Europe, MiCA has introduced uniform rules for custodians and crypto-asset service providers, known as CASPs. These rules define how digital assets must be segregated, safeguarded, and reported, allowing banks to passport tokenized funds across the European Economic Area without facing different national requirements. The UK and Singapore are building similar frameworks through Project Guardian to standardize tokenization in asset and wealth management. In the US, the obstacle is accounting treatment. Under the now-revised Staff Accounting Bulletin 121, or SAB 121, banks holding crypto for clients had to record those assets on their balance sheets as liabilities. That made large-scale custody uneconomical for systemically important banks, also known as G-SIBs. If future guidance removes that burden, these banks could hold tokenized assets without incurring punitive capital requirements, unlocking the full balance-sheet potential of tokenization. Until then, the firms already embedded in ETF custody, Coinbase, Fidelity, and BNY, retain a practical advantage. Coinbase’s $246 billion in assets under custody shows how much flow still runs through crypto-native infrastructure. Yet the gravitational pull of regulated fund structures is increasing. As tokenized Treasuries and money-market products scale, the operational logic of banking begins to merge with blockchain’s settlement mechanics. Money-market tokens may sound like plumbing, but plumbing determines who controls the flow of funds. In this race, the flow is not just digital assets but the future structure of the balance sheet itself.

Pump it up, Until you can feel it When we think about ETFs, we tend to think about large, cheap passive indexes. After all, those are the biggest ETFs from places like BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street. But when we look at all the new ETF launches, they tend to not be passive indexes, not be cheap, and not come necessarily from those three big companies. They’re active and they are involved in all sorts of different areas, that are off the beaten path. To figure out what this means for you and your portfolio, let’s bring to figure out what this means for your portfolio. Let’s bring in Dave Nadig. He is the President and Director of Research at ETF.com and an ETF structural expert, really since the inception of the entire sector. Dave, we’ve seen an explosion in the growth of not just new ETFs, but primarily active ETFs in all sorts of niches. What are you seeing in this space? Dave Nadig: Well, you know, for a long time ETF meant cheap index, right? I mean you go back to SPY and then the first iShares products, and then even when we started getting into the big expansion of the two thousands, it was all just index, index, index. Then we got some smart beta where we tried to be a little bit more clever and it wasn’t really until the late 2010 cycle where Kathy Wood at Ark Invest, launched ARKK and really put herself out there as the portfolio manager in a way that I don’t really frankly remember seeing since the dot-com boom, right? It’s been a long time since we’d had superstar managers on CNBC talking about, you know, pounding the table for a single stock. And Kathy did that and obviously had enormous amounts of success, has had some performance hiccups along the way, but that sort of went a little bit dormant during some of the pandemic when people really discovered trading. What we’ve seen now is this resurgence – particularly to folks I’d mentioned Dan Ives Wedbush, people know him; and Tom Lee from Fundstrat with his Granny Shots ETF, both of which have pulled in huge money, Barry Ritholtz: Billions of dollars? Dave Nadig: Billions and billions of dollars. And for the reasons you would expect because you’ve got smart people talking on podcasts and TV and on their own air and their own newsletters telling you why they own what’s in the fund. I know that sounds so dumb, but that’s why people love superstar managers because they can look and they can see Tom Lee on screen and he can sit there and say, yeah, this is why we like Bitcoin here. Here are the three firms we have in our fund because of it. We might be wrong, we might be right. There’s a level of authenticity to that that I think is really appreciated. I also think the fact that they’ve doubled the S&P this year doesn’t hurt. Barry Ritholtz: So to put some flesh on the bones here, Kathy Woods during 2020 was a huge Tesla and Bitcoin bull. The fund arc put up giant numbers, triple digit gains. Dan Ives has been an apple and an Nvidia bull, pretty much for as long as I can remember. He’s been a whole lot more right than wrong, and Tom Lee has been very constructive exactly when it paid to be constructive and stay bullish. All three of those managers have really big followings. What does the resurgence of brand name active managers mean for the ETF space? Dave Nadig: Well, first of all, I think it’s great for the ETF space because I think the dichotomy that we’d had where people thought of active as being a thing that happens somewhere else and ETFs were only passive, wasn’t helpful. I think we are moving towards a world where all of your exposures, for the most part are gonna be in an ETF wrapper. So by all means we should get active managers as part of this mix. And now we’ve got lots of them. You know, we’ve got a bunch of active funds from PIMCO was early, we’ve got lots in the bond space. You know, everything from Cumberland advisors to State Street with the double line and, and Jeff Gundlach. Lots of active managers in lots of different areas. I think that’s very healthy for the industry. For the individual investor, it doesn’t necessarily make your life easier because as much as I happen to, like all the people we have talked about, Dan, Dom Lee and Kathy – personally as people I would have dinner with, the math is not on their side as an industry, right? Barry Ritholtz: Why is that? Dave Nadig: As an industry, we have to point out active managers categorically underperform over time. Doesn’t mean they all do, but it means that you’ve gotta be the special person who managed to pick the right active manager at the right time. That is a tough business and even the active managers running these funds will tell you trying to time when to get in and out of their own funds is gonna be tough. So that’s the problem is that active management is tough to evaluate. Barry Ritholtz: Yeah, and to put some numbers there, half of all active managers underperform in any given year. You go out to 10, five years, it’s 80% underperform; at 10 years it’s 90%. So it’s a tough road to hoe But let’s talk about what makes active ETFs somewhat different than active mutual funds. And that data I referenced where all mutual fund data, mutual funds have to do a regular filing each quarter about their largest holdings, there has been a lot of back and forth about how transparent active ETFs have to be versus other active funds. What’s the state-of-the-art today? What is the regulatory environment? Dave Nadig: So there are solutions if you’re an active manager and you don’t want to tell everybody what you’re doing every day. There are solutions and there’s plenty of funds that have been launched on them. Fidelity has their versions. T Rowe Price has been one of the more successful funds out there. They have a pretty popular blue chip strategy called T Chip, which isn’t semi-transparent, meaning they’re not telling you the whole portfolio every day. They’re telling you once in a while and they’re giving the street just enough information to make a good market, not knowing all the information. So it’s sort of a, a clue, a bit of a hack to be semi-transparent. This solves a problem for some asset managers. It doesn’t solve a single problem for an individual investor, right? So like I’ve never heard an individual investor say, golly, I wish I knew less about what I owned. Right? Barry Ritholtz: Let’s talk about why it’s a problem for fund managers. Fund managers don’t buy a stock on a Monday and then they’re done. If they say, “Hey, we like XYZ, they’re buying that stock trying to take advantage of drawdowns buying it over days, weeks, even months. So there is a price advantage to the investor if the fund manager can be a little less transparent. Fair, fair description. Dave Nadig: That’s the, that’s certainly the argument that the active management industry who does not wanna disclose what they’re doing would give you. So you have articulated that side of the argument. Well, my counter to that would be if your strategy requires you buying securities where your action is going to move the market absent disclosure or absent, you know, obfuscation, then that strategy probably doesn’t belong in an ETF because you’ve got bigger problems, right? That means that you are in something small or a liquid or micro cap, at which point already, my question would be how do you plan on running a $10 billion ETF with that strategy? Because you can’t really close an ETF. So if you are a special situations manager, if you are a really sort of obscure nichey finding those stocks, nobody else knows about manager, you do not belong in the ETF industry. I’ll just flat out say it as simple as that. The mutual fund structure or even better, a liquidity cap structure like a CEF or an interval fund is actually a better structure for those kinds of investments. Everybody else, CEF, honestly there’s so much liquidity. I think it’s tough to argue that somebody like Tom Lee is being particularly hurt by being transparent. He’s double, he’s at 30% for the year. The S&P500 is up 15% Barry Ritholtz: CEF stands for closed end funds as opposed to ETFs. Dave Nadig: Yes. Barry Ritholtz: So, let’s talk about some other varieties of active funds that are a little bit out there. We see funds with options, futures, derivatives, inverse leveraged, and along with some wild income promises in an ETF wrapper. Tell us about some of those products. Dave Nadig: Yeah, the, the interesting thing about those is most of them are very mechanical, right? So if you’re running a leveraged strategy, you’re not making any decisions, right? I’ve got Apple, I need 2X Apple, I’m gonna go to my swap counterparty overnight and they’re just gonna settle up my two x swap. That’s the whole management process. But technically that’s gonna be an actively managed fund because you can’t just automate that whole process. Somebody still has to make a call about whether or not you’re teeing up the swap at this rate or that rate. Same thing with almost anything in the option space, because the options are constantly changing and constantly repricing and constantly rolling off. It’s very difficult to create solid index product around actively or high frequency moving positions in the options market. So for convenience as much as anything, almost all of those type products you mentioned are listed as active products. I refer to them as AiNOs — Active in Name Only, because they’re really, there’s no Tom Lee saying I really want Apple options today. There’s some guy generally Jay, pastor Elliot at title, sitting on a desk somewhere pushing a button to say yes, we want those options because the model says we need to roll. And that becomes active management. And consequently, I mean it is active management, it has higher costs associated with it for a reason. Some of that is the profit that the issuer wants, but some of it is legitimately you need a trading desk with a bunch of people doing work. Barry Ritholtz: So let’s talk about another niche. Illiquid alts, things like private equity, private credit, private debt, real estate. Are we gonna see those asset classes that really don’t trade on their own — because they’re not public – are we gonna see those in an ETF wrapper? Dave Nadig: We’re starting to, we’re starting to the, the canary in the coal mine here was some products from State Street, the big ones, priv, PRIV for private, which has a bunch of Apollo private credit in it. Generally pretty short maturity stuff, two, three year kind of things and, and fairly straightforward, understandable private credit. Intel needs to bill a fab in Ireland. They go get a loan, Apollo gives ’em the loan, you get a slice of it. Nothing super complicated, nothing super interesting either. I mean, it’s not, you’re not getting 20% yields out of or anything like that. You’re getting some marginal increase in the yield you would get if you were simply investing in say, junk or short term co corporates. So those products are starting to come to market. The concerns I have about them is they’re just gonna be untested. We’re not gonna really know how they’re going to perform when the markets go hinky, right? And, and also what does that even mean? Like if we had a corporate bond blowout and we saw a bunch of triple C stuff start defaulting, I have no idea what the impact on Apollo private credit issued in Ireland to Intel is going to be when that happens. I also have no idea how they’re gonna respond if half the fund decides they want out on that Tuesday and now you’ve got a bunch of illiquid stuff, which can be up to 35% of the portfolio that literally the only buyer is Apollo. Technically they’ve got answers to all those questions. I’m, and I read all the answers to those questions and I’m sort of not convinced, but it’s one of those things that if you wanna be, if you wanna be out there on the edge, by all means go ahead. But I think the private securities in the daily liquid vehicle has not really been through the ringer yet, so I remain very skeptical. Barry Ritholtz: So let’s talk a little bit about crypto and, and how that’s going to impact in both investor behavior and portfolio construction. Last year, BlackRock, was it last year or this year, BlackRock introduced IBIT. 2024. So it’s a year ago coming up on a 100 billion dollars in assets, probably the fastest ETF ever to do that. What does this mean? And explain the concept of tokenization. Dave Nadig: Yeah, so what it means is all of these assets are going to be more and more available to the average Joe like us who’s just trading in their Schwab account or something like that. And because the SEC has said they’re gonna make it very easy very soon, we’re gonna have every major coin that people know about a Solana and Avay whatever. There’ll be a sleeve of that in an ETF that you’ll be able to trade. That’s all great. Then having those building blocks is awesome, also because it will now allow portfolio managers to create portfolios of those individual securities, which right now you can’t even do, you can’t even buy an index right, of the top 10 coins because there isn’t a target for the top 10 coins to invest in. So that will be fun when we get that, and I suspect you’ll see firms like Bitwise and BlackRock who’ve got some real bonafides in the crypto management space, start bringing pretty institutional active management products there. That’s probably a 2026 side. Long term though, if we wanna talk 10 years from now, that’s when crypto starts becoming an interesting competitor to the ETF space. I think we will eventually end up in a world where how you move your ownership of Apple around is going to happen. Not by going to the New York Stock Exchange and exchanging ledger entries to move around your Schwab account. Instead, you’re gonna have an actual token. You’ll be able to look at the serial number of it, you’ll be able to put it in a wallet and say, “Oh no, this is worth a hundred shares of Apple.” And that wallet will be able to directly move that security to your wallet without any exchange being part of the process. Most of it will happen, like crypto happens now on giant exchanges because price discovery. But just like with Bitcoin, I could walk up to you when we could engage in a direct transaction, you’re gonna start seeing that with other securities. It’s happening more in bonds and real estate now. To do it in equities is gonna require some actual legislation and we don’t make so many laws these days. So that may take some time. Instead, what we’ll do is we’ll wrap a lot of stuff. So you, you’ll probably hear about things like Wrapped Apple and wrapped Cisco and what that’s gonna be is a token that owns the security in some sort of trust pool. That’s a baby step, but that’s what we’ll start hearing first. So be skeptical when people say we’re tokenizing everything ’cause it’s gonna be a decade. Barry Ritholtz: I had a conversation with Jose Minyana who is the head of wealth strategies at investment Giant BNY (Bank in New York) and he was saying, Hey, we went from T+3 to T+1, meaning it used to take three days to settle a trade. Today it’s gonna take one day. If we wanna get to T+0, we have to really have confidence in both sides of the transaction. And theoretically, tokenization solves that problem. Dave Nadig: It does. Although think about how many big transactions in the world that we could be doing easier. We deliberately put breaks on, think about buying a house… Barry Ritholtz: Wiring money?! Dave Nadig: BarryRight? So it, there’s, you know, the, there’s escrow, there’s secondary inspection processes, there’s separate contracts around just the intention to buy and sell. So the bigger and more interesting a transaction gets, the less T zero is actually a good idea, right? I mean, I, the, the thing I always say about T zero is, did you really want T zero during the flash crash in 2010? Like, did you really want no recourse for that? That fat fingered billion dollar pennies on the dollar trade? No. You wanted this ecosystem that protects you from a bad actor spoofing something into the system. So we we’re gonna have a lot to evaluate as a market, what we actually want. The idea of slowing down markets has actually gotten a lot of traction, like speed bump markets, things like that, that, that are actually pushing against this idea of instantaneous settlement for anything. I don’t even want instantaneous settlement for my bank account. I like knowing that I’ve got somebody I can call when something goes wrong. Barry Ritholtz: So, so you’ve written about volatility and liquidity laundering. Explain what this is and are these really gonna be ETFs? Dave Nadig: They already are, man. So volatility laundering is simply moving volatility from one bucket to another and charging something for the privilege of doing that. Right Now you can buy something like MSTY, which will give you a hundred percent income return on a MicroStrategy position through the magic of options, right? And it creates a synthetic long position. Then it does a synthetic covered call against the synthetic long position, and then it does a whole lot of return of capital to give you your money back and promises you this endless stream of high distributions, a high percentage distributions that is volatility laundering. Because what you are actually doing is you are trying to sell other people the volatility of MicroStrategy, which is probably not a fantastic idea because it, the vol of all is high in those cases. So you are being the person picking up the, in this case, quarters in front of the steamroll, not the pennies, but you’re still exposed to MicroStrategy collapsing and going to nothing. That volatility laundering is what all of these options strategies are really doing. Barry Ritholtz: So really to wrap this up, the bottom line is bring the same level of common sense and scrutiny to new ETFs that you would to any financial product. Make sure you understand what the product is, how it generates gains, the sort of risks you’re incurring, especially with these exotic products — And the costs. Are these products worth spending 75, 100, 125 basis points more than what you would get for a plain vanilla passive index that seems to be dominating the asset allocation space and the space for ETFs?

Title: U.K.’s FCA sues Justin Sun-linked exchange for unlawful promotions

The FCA has taken legal action against HTX, formerly Huobi Global, alleging it unlawfully promoted crypto services to UK consumers. The U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority is accusing Justin Sun-linked exchange HTX of promoting crypto services without proper authorization. The lawsuit demonstrates a welcome of regulated products, while cracking down on offshore exchanges that violate promotion laws. The U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority [FCA] has filed a civil lawsuit against crypto exchange HTX, formerly Huobi Global. It accused it of unlawfully marketing digital-asset services to U.K. consumers without authorization. The case, lodged in London’s High Court, targets HTX. Also, it targets its predecessor entity Huobi Global, and four unnamed individuals connected to the exchange’s promotional operations. The FCA stated that the exchange breached the country’s financial promotions regime by offering crypto services without meeting requirements. The FCA stated, according to a Financial Times report, that firms operating outside the U.K. but promoting crypto services to British consumers are still subject to the U.K.’s financial promotion rules. “We will not hesitate to act where firms flout the law or put UK investors at risk,” an FCA spokesperson told reporters. HTX already appears on the FCA’s warning list, which alerts the public to firms “not authorized and likely to be operating illegally.” Market observers are describing the new case as a test of jurisdiction for U.K. authorities seeking to rein in global exchanges marketing to domestic users. The lawsuit adds to a growing list of legal challenges linked to Justin Sun, HTX’s de facto owner and founder of the Tron Network. In March 2023, the U.S. SEC charged Sun and the Tron Foundation for allegedly selling unregistered securities and orchestrating wash trades in TRX and BTT. That case remains open, although court filings indicate that both parties are exploring a potential settlement. Sun has also faced scrutiny over governance concerns, with reports alleging he controls the majority of TRX’s circulating supply. The U.K. action could widen regulatory pressure on Sun-associated firms. HTX’s integration with Tron-based assets and Sun’s recent efforts to expand HTX’s global footprint have kept his empire in regulators’ crosshairs. The lawsuit comes amid sweeping regulatory changes in the U.K. Earlier this month, the U.K. lifted its ban on retail access to crypto exchange-traded products [ETPs]. This allows Bitcoin and Ethereum ETPs from firms such as BlackRock and WisdomTree to list on the London Stock Exchange. Meanwhile, the Bank of England is preparing new stablecoin rules, signalling a broader tightening of oversight even as the country opens to institutional crypto investment.

Hollywood has hit a breaking point. Audiences are fatigued by franchise sequels and reboots. YouTube has overtaken Disney as the world’s largest distributor. And Gen AI tools like Sora 2 can soon turn anyone into a filmmaker. Yet one thing hasn’t changed: how films get financed. And that’s why we keep getting fewer original films. Decline of original screenplays at the US box office (1984-2023) Source: The Numbers and Box Office Mojo For decades, filmmakers have had only two ways to raise capital: courting wealthy “patrons of the arts” or signing away IP in restrictive studio deals. These small circles still control who the next David Lynch will be, or which film becomes the next Napoleon Dynamite, while everyday fans — the people who live and breathe these films — have never had a seat at the table. (Fewer than 1% of Americans meet SEC “accreditation” standards to invest in most private ventures, including film.) That’s finally changing, thanks to tokenization. The promise of "decentralization in film” has arrived, quietly and legally this time. A few years ago, “Web3 Film” had the right dream but the wrong tools: people were slicing films into NFT frames, touting complex tokenomics and skirting securities laws. None of it worked. Projects like Stoner Cats, Ashton Kutcher’s NFT cartoon, became cautionary tales after the SEC cracked down for selling unregistered securities to unaccredited investors. Today, the difference is compliance. Through licensed platforms operating under SEC exemptions such as Reg CF, production companies can take on thousands of unaccredited investors (even in the U.S.) to back real film projects and share in the upside. Security tokens issued on blockchain rails make it possible to distribute dividends transparently and cost-effectively — and, eventually, trade investors’ stakes on secondary markets. And it’s already working. Tens of thousands of investors have contributed more than $30 million to premium productions from some of Hollywood’s most respected names. This year, Robert Rodriguez (Sin City, Spy Kids) raised $2 million from 2,000 fans to invest in new action films — and every investor got to pitch him a film as part of the slate. Pressman Film — the company behind American Psycho, Wall Street and The Crow — raised $2 million for a slate of bold, original films, and is already starting to return capital within six months. And Eli Roth (Hostel, Inglorious Basterds) launched a fan-owned horror studio that maxed out its $5 million Reg CF campaign in July. He was tired of studios deeming his ideas too gory, even though the most profitable film of 2024 was the unrated slasher, Terrifier 3. Tokenized fan investing is opening up new paths for capital and creativity. Filmmakers can now tap their audiences for capital instead of taking the studio deal, allowing them to retain more ownership of their IP and take creative risks without interference from the suits or the algorithm. For fans, tokenization opens up access to a previously inaccessible opportunity: investing in film as an alternative asset class. Ultimately, these projects tend to perform better — not just creatively but financially — as audiences with skin in the game drive buzz and box-office returns. The timing couldn’t be better. With IPOs slowing and private markets swelling, tokenization is unlocking billions in household capital and opening doors to previously gatekept opportunities across private credit, venture capital and now, film. The GENIUS Act has brought long-awaited regulatory clarity to digital assets, while institutions from BlackRock to Visa are embedding blockchain infrastructure into the mainstream economy. Tokenization has quietly graduated from crypto casino to financial plumbing, and entertainment is proving to be one of its most relatable (and needed) use cases. There may be no better Trojan horse for mainstream adoption of tokenization than culture real-world assets (RWAs). Few industries are as ripe for disruption as film, and none as universally relatable, considering nearly all of us end our day watching Netflix (and then complain about the content). But when the audience can invest in the projects they want to see, whether from established filmmakers or up-and-coming creators, we won’t just get new financing models. We’ll get better movies.

Title: Andreessen Horowitz Says Crypto Has Entered a ‘New Era’ of Real Utility
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/10/22/andreessen-horowitz-says-crypto-has-entered-a-new-era-of-real-utility

Crypto’s future is starting to look more like a global financial system and less like a speculative playground, according to Andreessen Horowitz. In its State of Crypto 2025 report, a16z analysts argue that the industry has entered a new era shaped by infrastructure upgrades, regulatory clarity and deeper ties with traditional finance. Among the most important trends for the coming year: stablecoin growth, real-world assets moving onchain, and new intersections with artificial intelligence (AI). Stablecoins, which enable fast and cheap dollar transfers, are seeing wide adoption from institutions like Visa, Citi and PayPal. Visa said it sees strong demand in volatile emerging markets and cross-border payments. According to a16z, stablecoins handled $46 trillion in transactions over the past year — more than double PayPal — and now rival major networks like ACH and Visa. They’re also becoming major U.S. Treasury holders, surpassing countries like South Korea and Germany. As regulatory efforts in the U.S. gain traction, stablecoins could strengthen the dollar’s global position. Legislation around market structure is expected to be a top priority in 2025, giving companies a clearer framework to launch products and onboard users. Institutional momentum is picking up too. BlackRock and JPMorgan are building crypto partnerships, while Morgan Stanley plans to offer crypto trading on E*TRADE starting at the beginning of 2025. Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for bitcoin BTC$111,527.41 and ethereum ETH$3,986.11 now hold over $175 billion combined, signaling a shift from fringe asset to portfolio staple. Meanwhile, a quiet infrastructure revolution is underway. Ethereum upgrades and the rise of Solana have pushed blockchain transaction speeds to over 3,400 per second — closing in on the scale of credit card networks. These technical improvements, along with new privacy tools like zero-knowledge proofs and preparations for quantum-resistant encryption, are making blockchains more usable and secure. Real-world assets such as U.S. Treasuries, commodities and equity instruments are beginning to move onchain, with $30 billion already tokenized. This shift could rewire how capital markets operate by creating more efficient settlement layers and round-the-clock liquidity. AI is also becoming part of the equation. Developers are exploring how crypto tools like decentralized infrastructure and smart contracts can check the growing concentration of power in big tech's hands. Though crypto has lost some engineering talent to AI startups, it's also pulling new entrants from adjacent industries. Finally, developers are starting to focus more on revenue-generating products. Projects brought in $18 billion last year, and about $4 billion of that flowed directly to tokenholders — hinting at a maturing business model that rewards users and investors alike. As user numbers reach up to 70 million, a16z expects consumer apps to drive the next wave of growth. The report paints a picture of crypto not as a trend but as a long-term platform — one that’s finally finding its footing in the mainstream economy.

Time Published: 2025-10-22T14:48:10Z
Full Content:
Jennie O\u0027Sullivan The jury in the trial of two men accused of the murder of a man whose skeletal remains were found five months after he was first reported missing, has retired to consider its verdicts. Luke Taylor, aged 28, formerly of Cherry Lawn, Blackrock, Cork, and 33-year-old Niall Long, formerly of St Michael's Close, Mahon, Cork, have both pleaded not guilty to the murder of Kieran Quilligan. The murder count which each man denies states that on a date unknown between 1 September 2023 and 29 January 2024, at an unknown location within the State in the District Court area of Cork City he did murder 47-year-old Kieran Quilligan contrary to Common Law. Before the jury began their deliberations this afternoon, Ms Justice Siobhán Lankford told the two women and 10 men that they are dealing with two seperate trials and the verdict in respect of one of the defendants could be different to the verdict on the other, if the jury so decided. Ms Justice Lankford said their verdicts had to be unaminous. She said there are three verdicts open to the jury in respect of each defendant. They can find him guilty of murder, not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter, or not guilty of murder. Mr Quilligan was first reported missing on 1 September 2023. His skeletal remains were found on scrub land near Midleton on 29 January 2024, almost five months later. © RTÉ 2025.

Title: APT price soars as BlackRock’s BUIDL fund expands to Aptos
URL: https://coinjournal.net/news/apt-price-soars-as-blackrocks-buidl-fund-expands-to-aptos/
Time Published: 2025-10-22T14:46:05Z
Full Content:
The APT price is showing renewed strength as Aptos gains major institutional backing from global giants like BlackRock and Jump Crypto. After dipping to a yearly low earlier this month, Aptos has staged an impressive comeback, fueled by real-world asset tokenisation and enterprise-grade innovation across its ecosystem. Aptos has outperformed a sluggish crypto market, gaining around 5% in the past 24 hours to trade near $3.32. This sharp rebound follows BlackRock’s expansion of its Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) to the Aptos blockchain, a move that has injected $500 million worth of tokenised Treasuries into the network. 🚨 $500M more of @BlackRock's BUIDL just landed on Aptos. This pushes Aptos back into the Top 3 in RWAs, with $1.2B+ tokenized assets on-chain. And now, we're #2 in BUIDL adoption. Institutions are choosing Aptos, the chain to move what matters. pic.twitter.com/vT3jfZYmPb — Aptos (@Aptos) October 21, 2025 The deployment of BUIDL has pushed Aptos into the top tier of real-world asset (RWA) blockchains, sitting just behind Ethereum and zkSync Era. Data shows that more than $1.2 billion in RWAs are now tokenised on Aptos, a milestone that marks growing trust from traditional finance. Notably, BlackRock’s involvement brings not only prestige but also liquidity and credibility to the network. In parallel, Jump Crypto has launched Shelby, a decentralised, high-performance storage layer developed in collaboration with Aptos Labs. Storage is the missing layer. Blockchains run fast. Oracles work. Messages move across chains. But without high performance storage, real execution stays centralized. We're building Shelby with @AptosLabs to fix that.https://t.co/VFtuFRQp4P — Jump Crypto 🔥💃🏻 (@jump_) October 21, 2025 Designed to rival traditional cloud providers such as AWS and Google Cloud, Shelby enables sub-second latency, low-cost reads and writes, and improved scalability. Its architecture reduces redundancy while maintaining high data durability through erasure coding. The new system could become a backbone for decentralised applications that require real-time data access and high-speed processing. By combining Aptos’s parallel execution engine and Move programming language with Shelby’s efficient data design, the two firms aim to create infrastructure suited for enterprise and AI-driven decentralised finance (DeFi). This blend of performance and programmability is helping Aptos carve a niche in a crowded Layer-1 field. As institutional adoption accelerates and on-chain liquidity grows, the Aptos price could continue to benefit from renewed investor confidence. While short-term volatility remains, the network’s long-term fundamentals appear stronger than ever — anchored by innovation, partnerships, and a clear path toward real-world integration. The Aptos price is currently testing resistance near $3.50 after rebounding from a recent low of $2.22. Technical indicators show mixed signals, with moving averages flashing multiple sell alerts, although oscillators remain neutral. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) hovers around 34, suggesting mild accumulation. If APT breaks above $3.50, it could extend gains toward $3.85. However, failure to maintain current momentum could see the token slip toward $3.00 or even retest its earlier lows. Analysts like Michaël van de Poppe have noted that APT remains at one of its lowest valuations in years, hinting at potential upside if broader market sentiment improves.

Title: Blockbuster $40b AI Investment Is Only 10% of What’s Coming (NVDA, MSFT, META, BLK)

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 AI giants including Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, and Oracle recently announced a $40 billion deal that will help them secure coveted computing capacity for artificial intelligence. The blockbuster data center deal is a big reason why Morgan Stanley estimates that Global AI infrastructure spending is projected to hit $400 billion this year. Some speculate that all of this AI dependency can be risky, however, because if AI stumbles, all major tech stocks could fall simultaneously. Previously, individual companies were affected by performance in their specific sectors, but now many will rise and fall together based on AI sentiment. It’s why so many have compared this moment to the dot-com boom of the late 1990s, where enthusiasm for a single technological trend drove valuations beyond reason. Douglas McIntyre: Lee, one of the things we’re seeing in the world of AI is these massive alliances, you know, where different companies form partnerships and everybody brings piece of their expertise to the thing and work together. It’s not always clear who gets what from whom and who put what in, but you’ve got one, you just, you got one that just came out. Lee Jackson: Boy, do I ever, I mean, when you get, okay, and I’m gonna have to, I’m gonna read these off to you, Doug. When you get BlackRock, who’s clearly has more dough than anybody in the world, Nvidia, Microsoft, and OpenAI to all chip in $40 billion to buy aligned data centers. That shows you that the demand for cloud computing and data center storage, and, and retrieval and all of that has got to be, they see it to be exponentially much, much bigger than we can see it right now. Or why would they go in and spend $40 billion to buy this? And I think it’s, I think it’s pretty provocative because it’s, it’s like all four major partners in the industry who have been very happy to just do circular financing is now, we have now deemed it to be that they’re gonna combine to have this capacity for, for cloud computing and, and all the above. But $40 billion is a big chunk of dough even for those kind of major players. And it’s interesting. Will we see more of this? Will we see other data center providers? And there’s big ones, you know, there’s super big ones and, you know, Digital Realty people like that. Will somebody go in and make a big play for them? Or somebody you know of that size and scope. I think it’ll be interesting to see if this expands and there’s more data center purchases, you know, as we head down the road. McIntyre: If you called me up tomorrow and said to me that Microsoft bought Duke Energy there’s, or Constellation, it’s, this is crazy enough now, so that you could actually see a consolidation based on an based on ownership. If I’ve got, if I’ve got the technology and you’ve got the infrastructure, maybe I should just buy you. Jackson: Absolutely. And I don’t think, you know, and as we’ve discussed, you know, you’re not gonna build any small scale nuclear reactors anytime soon. And the approval process, you know, could take forever. Although I’m sure they could help speed it up ’cause we’re gonna need it for the national power grid ’cause we’re gonna need it. But yeah, I think, I think that’s true. And you know, there’s big players like Digital and Equinix and people like that, you know, that have been in the business forever, you know, from, you know, startup, you know. In that industry. And it’s interesting to focus on, well, will they continue to build more or will people continue to consolidate that industry? Because again, the question is, is it getting away from itself as well? Are we building too many data centers? I don’t think so because the demand is just never ending. But boy, it, there’s gonna be a point, I think when, and, and we’ve had this discussion where data center usage and power usage is gonna, there, there’s gonna be an issue here at some point, and that’s why most of these people are trying to desperately to find a way. That’s why they’re building data centers in North Dakota and South Dakota because of the, the big, you know, oil fields up there, and that’s why they’re building them in Texas. That’s why they’re building them out in the Permian and out there. And so it’s like, okay, if we can’t bring the electricity to us, we’ll go to where the gas, the natural gas is, and we’ll build our own. McIntyre: It’s funny, CNBC did a, an article today and it’s, it’s, it’s based on a, a see your own shadow premise. Apparently, the people looking for data centers are shopping around the utilities. So if I’m gonna build a data center, I may call 10 utilities try to. What’s happening is the utilities are now getting confused about how many data centers there might be. Because if, if you call me and it’s just, I’m the one utility and you’re the one person who wants a data center, that’s easy to count, right? One guy called me about one data center, but if I’m the utility and ten data centers around and you say to me, “Do a forecast. I want you to forecast for me how many data centers we’re gonna have to support. It’s like, well, ten guys called me, but if I don’t get any of them? Or what if I get all 10? So there’s a capacity calculation problem that has the chance of me being that you’ll have overbuilding it. It could be that people have phone calls that they think, well, I’ll, I’ll build because I’m gonna get five of the ten. The town over does the same thing. There is a situation, scenario, as they say, where you could have overbuilding based on shadow demand, is they asked me, so it must be that they’ve picked me. Jackson: And the thing that will be interesting to see, if we do overbuild, which typically you know, has happened in the United States for, you name it, what do you do with empty data centers, with racks and racks and racks of servers> McIntyre: When that happens, we’ll just pull out the racks and turn ’em into huge barnyards. Listen, at least we know they have to be close to water for cooling. We know that they’ll get some electricity, so we need to keep the lights on for the cattle. So there’ll be water for the cattle ’cause they’ll be located, they’ll have water and we’ll have some electricity and we can use it. We can use them basically as a huge farm. Jackson: Well, I think this deal is either the beginning of the end or the end of the beginning. You know, I don’t know what it is for the data center wave and, and, and data center building and data center construction, but we’ll find that out soon enough.

Title: The M&A Curse of Warner Bros. Discovery | Analysis

Pro Available to WrapPRO members WBD is officially in play. Can CEO David Zaslav do right by his shareholders after three-plus years of holding a declining stock? Warner Bros. Discovery announced it was undergoing a “strategic review” on Tuesday after the company said it is fielding “unsolicited interest” from “multiple parties” for all or part of its business. Its stock popped 11% on the news. But mergers have generally not been kind to the company that started out as Warner Brothers in 1923, including what history will record as one of the worst mergers ever with AOL Time Warner, whose shareholders lost $2oo billion in the aftermath of that dot-com bubble marriage in the early aughts. That didn’t stop the Ellisons’ billions, which have actually made what would have otherwise been a ho-hum year for M&A in media and entertainment pretty interesting. Through their own new acquisition, Paramount, they set off a steeplechase for Warner Bros. Discovery — either as a whole entertainment conglomerate, or as two separated units in Warner Bros. and Discovery Global. That now begs the question of whether the Ellisons would take yet another crack at buying WBD, or maybe just the Warner Bros. studio and HBO, on a hot streak right now. Or do we see some new deep-pocketed buyers emerge? Paramount reportedly made a $20 a share bid for WBD that was spurned, and then two additional bids under $30 a share according to CNBC, leading to CEO David Zaslav‘s announcement: “After receiving interest from multiple parties, we have initiated a comprehensive review of strategic alternatives to identify the best path forward to unlock the full value of our assets.” But the constituency we aren’t reading too much about here is the WBD shareholders who are sitting on a stock at Tuesday’s close that is still 17% lower than when WBD first started trading on April 11, 2022, after Zaslav engineered his Discovery’s takeover of Warner. That is 17% lower, notably, even with the takeover talk bump to WBD stock from when Paramount’s interest first broke and then the 11% rise on Tuesday. For shareholders, that’s three-plus years of watching your stock go in the opposite direction of where it’s supposed to go. Big shareholders include Vanguard Group and BlackRock on the institutional side, and Condé Nast owners the Newhouse family and cable mogul John Malone on the individual side. (Malone inherited the Warner stock, a big bonus over the downward course where Discovery was headed.) The Ellisons seem suited to shake things up. It feels like their parachuting into Hollywood was all about that, with the bags of cash to make it happen. But now that the “For Sale” sign is officially up at WBD, you’d have to consider Netflix, Amazon, Apple, Comcast or maybe even a consortium of private equity or Saudi backers as potentially interested suitors. On Tuesday, Ted Sarandos left the door open to considering Warner, saying on the earnings call: “We focus on profitable growth and reinvesting in our business, both organically and through selective M&A,” Sarandos said, with an emphasis on selective M&A for effect. Zaslav brought in the big-gun investment bankers to assist with his review, Allen & Co., J.P. Morgan and Evercore. Let’s pause for a minute to consider the math: $12.54 — This was WBD’s closing price on Sept. 10, the day before Bloomberg broke the news that Paramount was preparing a bid. $16.17 — This was WBD’s closing price the next day, showing a 29% bump on a so-called takeover premium. Takeover offers in the media space have been attracting a 20% to 25% premium. If Paramount did indeed offer $20 per share offer, that represents a 59% premium from the $12.54 where WBD was languishing before the takeover news broke. But clearly Zaslav and team are thinking that WBD could see more upside from bringing in other potential buyers to boost a premium for the company. Circling back to those downtrodden WBD shareholders. Bank of America Securities on Tuesday placed a value of $30 per share on WBD ($26 for the Warner Bros. studio, which includes HBO, and $4 for the cable networks side, which includes CNN). So what if a buyer would come in with a $30 a share offer for the whole company? That would be a 48% premium to the current price, and 140% premium to the Sept. 10 closing price. Pretty enticing for a shareholder who’s held on for three years in a downward slide. Zaslav was schooled under the legendary General Electric CEO Jack Welch when he was starting out at NBC, so don’t underestimate his deal savvy, even though WBD shareholders are feeling like they got stuck with a dud.

Tech Companies Pushing Off Those Exits: Research firm CB Insights reported some interesting data last week as part of its State of Venture Q3’25 Report that shows that tech companies are in less of a rush to strike an exit. “The ability to raise at decacorn ($10 billion and above) valuations while staying private removes the pressure to go public for capital. Companies can now scale to a massive size, hire top talent through liquid secondary markets, and maintain founder control — all without the quarterly earnings pressure or regulatory burdens associated with going public,” CB Insights explains. Average time for tech startups to stay private rose from 12.2 years in 2015 to 15.9 years in 2025. See below. 2. AI Killing Jobs? Not if You Look at This Data: It seems like companies are increasingly bringing people on board who help embed AI into daily operations, but new data dispells the widespread notion that the technology is a job killer. The Economist cites work by Seyed Hosseini and Guy Lichtinger, both doctoral students at Harvard University who have been tracking companies that hired “generative-AI integrators.” The students used AI itself to go through 200 million job postings and found 130,000 such vacancies at 10,600 firms that they called “AI adopters.” See below for the upward trend. When you hear Libby Bush talk about her motivating drive over the years, one that has been rewarded with a senior executive role for partnerships at CAA, it’s hard not to think it came from her days on the soccer pitches and lacrosse fields of her youth outside Philadelphia. She ended up playing Division I lacrosse for the University of Richmond Spiders, a sport she’s still involved with near her home in Pacific Palisades. “I certainly didn’t get promoted because I waited for somebody to recognize my worth. It takes fighting for yourself, asking for things even though you might not feel qualified or you might not feel like you’ve hit the mark completely to deserve it. The worst people can say is no. “It’s a little bit of the fake it til you make it. I never worked for an agency. How did I have the right to start one? But I believed enough in myself, I was willing to take the risk and I was willing to hear the word no as many times as I needed to until I heard the word yes. Holding myself back and not doing it because I didn’t have the qualifications was just never a part of the trajectory for me.” Sure feels like the spark of a competitive athlete is still in there somewhere. Bush, 43, spoke to our TV business reporter Lucas Manfredi for last week’s installment of our Office With a View executive Q&A series about the importance of brands becoming an essential tool for creators to both finance and market their projects across platforms. Bush has been responsible for leading the CAA team behind collaborations between hit series like Netflix’s “Bridgerton” and Flonase and Apple TV+’s “Severance” and State Farm. She’s also worked closely on connecting brands directly with CAA clients through projects like Ariana Grande’s Swarovski ad campaign, the NBC competition series “On Brand With Jimmy Fallon” and Kerry Washington’s YouTube series “Street You Grew Up On.” Bush, whose career has taken her to the NBA, WNBA, Disney and to her own startup agency Tandem Entertainment that CAA later purchased, is aware how important it was to hone her own story if she was going to help creators and brands do the same. “One size does not fit all in this business. There’s a lot of options on how to financially get deals done and creatively tell great stories in entertainment and culture.” Ad Age this year put her on its list of Leading Women, an honor for which some commenters on LinkedIn called her a “badass.” Our favorite part of her interview with Lucas was this career advice: “I would also say I learned a lot about mentorship and mentoring. When you work in really big corporations and you start out young in your career in these big organizations, you realize really quickly that people will continue to grow in their careers and they may end up anywhere. “So to me, it was always about treating everybody — whether they were next to you, below you or above you — the same, and how important it is to collect relationships and nurture them. Your network becomes everything to you in your career. Understanding how to use it and protect it and nurture it is a really big lesson for me throughout those companies.” The PR Guy Who Says The AI Boom Is a Bust, Channels with Peter Kafka podcast What’s Your AI-dentity?

Today’s top news: DraftKings just made its most aggressive move yet outside of sports betting. And it wasn’t into casino, poker, or fantasy. It was into prediction markets. 📌 What Happened DraftKings announced it is acquiring Railbird Technologies, a CFTC-regulated prediction market exchange, and will use it to launch a standalone events trading app called DraftKings Predictions. Railbird comes with what Kalshi and others fought hard for - federal approval from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to let people trade real-money contracts on real-world outcomes. Now DraftKing’s 6M monthly users will get access to prediction markets (and its $15B company has a shiny new expansion path). DraftKings says the new app will launch “in the coming months” and initially cover non-sports markets - things like finance, pop culture, elections, entertainment, and news. Though sports are very likely to come later (especially in states where DraftKings is currently banned). 🗣️ What Are They Saying “We are excited about the additional opportunity that prediction markets could represent for our business. We believe that Railbird’s team and platform—combined with DraftKings’ scale, trusted brand, and proven expertise in mobile-first products—positions us to win in this incremental space.” - DraftKings CEO Jason Robins said in a statement to CNBC “DraftKings acquires prediction market firm Railbird As I shared last week prediction markets are the future for sports wagering Less than a week later you see $DKNG getting involved.” - Rippe, on X “$DKNG is acquiring CFTC-licensed predictions platform Railbird to launch “DraftKings Predictions” a marketplace for trading outcomes in finance, culture & entertainment. It’s a move to tap non-sports states like California & Texas in the coming months.” - Shay Boloor on X 🧠 Why It Matters If prediction markets needed any more validation, they got it here from DraftKings. They have simply become too big to ignore and are now fully crossing over into mainstream betting. There’s also a new battle brewing between two worlds: DraftKings brings three big advantages: They will be a force to be reckoned with in this space. A lot depends on timing here. Someone who is used to betting elections on Polymarket probably won’t switch to DraftKings. But - if DraftKings beats Polymarket to the US market with its new DraftKings Predictions app, it could absolutely steal that average user who knows what prediction markets are / Polymarket is, but doesn’t want to hassle with VPNs. And if DK sports prediction markets have the same liquidity that Kalshi has shown over the past few months, then they could steal significant market share in sports. The bull case is, the entrance of DraftKings into the prediction market sector grows the overall pie and drives weekly volumes even further up and to the right. The bear case - the sector is zero-sum for the near future and any DK share is taken from an existing leader. My gut is, the bull case will prevail for the near future.

Title: Dublin to host Michelin star ceremony – could Ireland be about to get a three-star restaurant?

The Michelin Guide annual ceremony for Britain and Ireland will land in Dublin for the first time in February next year. The selection of an Irish city for the ceremony on February 9th, following Glasgow in 2025, is not just about geography – it’s about signalling that Ireland’s culinary moment is now. At the event in Dublin’s Convention Centre, the Guide will unveil stars, Bibs Gourmands, Green Stars and special awards for “the most talented restaurant teams and chefs from Great Britain and Ireland”. The ceremony will also be livestreamed globally. La Rousse Foods, Musgrave’s premium food service brand, will be official partner. If past years are anything to go by, the Bibs and Green Stars will be teased or quietly announced before the main stars are revealed. In Ireland the speculation about awards is electric. Chapter One in Dublin under Mickael Viljanen and Ross Lewis is viewed as possibly being in line for a third Michelin star. It currently holds two. Liath in Blackrock, Co Dublin, with chef Damien Grey is widely tipped as one to watch – again, rumours suggest a push toward three stars. Dede in Baltimore, Co Cork, helmed by Ahmet Dede and managed by Maria Archer, is also in the conversation for top-tier elevation. For two-star upgrades, names to watch include Lady Anne at Mount Juliet Estate (chef John Kelly) and Adare Manor (chef Mike Tweedie), which is also gearing up to host the Ryder Cup in 2027. Dublin’s incomprehensibly overlooked spots are Library Street Café and Una Mas, both long considered deserving of a first star. The newer challengers – Lena and Comet – may well be poised to make their first splash. Outside Dublin, the Park Hotel Kenmare in Co Kerry under Bryan and Tara Meehan already holds two Michelin Keys for its hotel offering and is undergoing a significant expansion. The owners may well be holding off on chasing a Michelin star for their Landline restaurant, adorned with Seán Scully paintings, until after this upgrade is complete. In a more general sense, hosting the Michelin ceremony in Ireland is symbolic, speaking of recognition and rising ambitions. But hosting isn’t the same as winning. The kitchens still need to deliver. Between now and next February, a few questions are sure to keep buzzing around the Irish restaurant scene. Will Chapter One finally get its third star? Given its pedigree this is internationally accepted as overdue. Will Liath and Dede join the three-star club? It would be a big ask, but the talk is loud. And will there be any surprise entries? We should remember that newcomers often sneak in; we’ll be watching Lena and Comet closely.

Title: How Beyond Meat became the market's latest meme-stock darling

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Good morning and welcome to First Trade. Warner Bros. Discovery is trying to gin up a bidding war, and stock investors seem to think a sale is a great idea. Maybe they want "Westworld" back on HBO Max. Rundown But first, a blast from the past. Love Business Insider? Log into Google and make us a preferred source. Was this email forwarded to you? Sign up now. Market musings It's 2019. You get out of an "Avengers: Endgame" screening and pop your earbuds in. You like this up-and-coming artist, Billie Eilish, who seems pretty promising. You fire up a new app called TikTok. You can't figure out how it's different from Vine, but everyone seems to be into it. You pop into a local eatery and order one of those new plant-based Beyond Meat burgers that everyone's talking about. The company is valued at $14 billion. It doesn't taste great, but you're told it's the future of food. Fast-forward to the present day. Beyond Meat is worth less than $1 billion, and was a penny stock until very recently. Sales are a fraction of what they were. No, this is not some dystopian reality. The fact is, the competition stacked up against Beyond, and demand for meat alternatives waned. But something has shifted in the stock this week. Shares surged 128% (to $1.47) on Monday, on trading that was roughly 70 times the average. It followed that up on Tuesday with a 146% increase (to $3.62) on even more volume. Then it soared another 65% on Wednesday, bringing the three-day move to more than 800%. What gives? Well, it turns out that a retail investor named Dimitri Semenikhin (screen name: Capybara Stocks) has been buying up all the Beyond shares he can find. He says he now owns about 4% of the company's outstanding stock, and he posted about it on Reddit. Given the fact that Beyond already carried the natural characteristics of a meme stock — a nostalgic brand heavily shorted by institutions — the post was like catnip to Semenikhin's fellow retail traders. Business Insider's Sam O'Brient tracked down Semenikhin — who is based in Dubai — on Monday, while Beyond stock was ripping. He wanted to find out what was motivating him. Why take such a big position in a downtrodden penny stock down more than 80% year to date? Semenikhin provided some fundamental reasons. Key among them was the completion of a convertible note exchange, which he says lessens its previously high risk of bankruptcy and greatly strengthens its balance sheet. He said this was incorrectly viewed by some as a negative. "At the current price that I bought in, the pricing was just way too low for what was happening," he told BI. In a separate interview on Tuesday, he said that he sees the stock soaring another 66% from current levels, to around $6 per share. Semenikhin's undervaluation thesis may very well be true. After all, Beyond on Tuesday announced a collaboration with Walmart that — when combined with the lingering retail rocket fuel, and the stock's addition to a meme-stock ETF — sent shares surging more than 100% for a second straight day. But there's also no denying that Semenikhin is trying to emulate the playbook of Roaring Kitty, the GameStop-obsessed retail investor who was eventually immortalized in his very own movie. It's also clear he's having a similar effect, with Monday's price surge in Beyond defying fundamental logic. There's the regular YouTube posting. There's the Reddit activity (although his original post is now deleted). And there's the unrepentant desire to drive a short squeeze. Will Semenikhin go full Roaring Kitty and start wearing a signature headband? That remains to be seen. But the similarities run deep, and BI will continue to check in with him for updates. Look at that V-shaped bounce! Thanks a lot, Dimitri Semenikhin (and Walmart). Beyond Meat stock is now down just 4% in 2025, compared to the 86% loss through last Thursday's close. The rally has coincided with unprecedented options-trading volume for the stock, and as daily shares traded broke the 1 billion threshold for two straight sessions. The title of this chart from BlackRock Investment Institute says it all: earnings expectations for companies in the S&P 500 are reaccelerating. This is reflected by the upward slope of the orange line, which shows the 12-month change in profit forecasts. This aligns with the guidance we've gotten so far from industry bellwethers during the third-quarter reporting season. On Tuesday alone, General Motors, GE, Lockheed Martin, and RTX raised future earnings forecasts. Culture confidential Business Insider's Will Edwards spotlights a hot trend dominating Wall Street and the finance industry. They make you feel like you're walking on a cloud. You can wear them with a suit or with jeans. They'll earn you street cred with finance bros. The catch? They're $1,100. Zegna's Triple Stitch shoes have unofficially become Wall Street's hottest footwear, exploding in popularity in recent years amid the quiet luxury movement. Apple CEO Tim Cook sports them. CNBC host Andrew Ross Sorkin told BI he wears them too, and that he sees them everywhere. The Wall Street Journal proclaimed a few years back that they're the most-worn shoes on private jets. But they're not only popular with the uber-rich. Sales associates at multiple Zegna locations in Manhattan said that they have a wide age range of financial industry clients. Are they really worth the hype? Eager to see for myself, I went to the brand's global store on 57th Street in NYC to try on a pair. My review, in short? They're absolutely worth the money. If you're the type of person who is OK with dropping a rent payment on some sneakers, at least. I didn't love their plain look initially, but how they feel on your feet completely changes your perception of them. I'm usually a size 11.5, but the folks at the store said they recommend going a half-size up. They come in 30 different color options — I went with a black and white scheme. They were easily the most comfortable pair of shoes I'd ever worn. After being made a convert, I decided to head out and try to spot a pair of them in the wild. Given that it was rainy, I was doubtful I'd find anyone. But within minutes, as I approached Park Avenue, there was a pair walking right at me.

Title: Why Some Bitcoin Whales Are Converting Their BTC Into Spot ETF Shares: Bloomberg

Some large bitcoin holders are moving coins into spot exchange-traded funds through in-kind creations, converting off-platform BTC into brokerage-account assets they can borrow against or include in estate plans, Bloomberg reported Tuesday. The mechanics rest on a summer policy shift. On July 29, 2025, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced the decision to approve orders allowing in-kind creations and redemptions for crypto-asset exchange-traded product (ETP) shares, a policy which covers spot bitcoin exchange traded funds (ETFs). The agency called the change a break from earlier cash-only approvals for spot bitcoin and ether and an alignment with long-standing practice for commodity ETPs. In practice, the SEC said authorized participants can deliver or receive the underlying asset, rather than cash, when creating or redeeming ETP shares. SEC Chair Paul Atkins said the shift would make products “less costly and more efficient,” while Trading and Markets Director Jamie Selway called it an “important development” that adds flexibility for issuers and investors. Against that backdrop, Bloomberg reported that some whales are handing BTC to ETFs and receiving fund shares without selling, a structure the outlet noted is generally tax-neutral because no sale is recorded. The exposure stays the same, but it appears in a brokerage account where it can be pledged as collateral or folded into estate planning, Bloomberg said. Activity is already visible, Bloomberg reported. BlackRock has facilitated more than $3 billion of such conversions, its head of digital assets Robbie Mitchnick said. Bitwise told Bloomberg it is getting daily inquiries from clients who want holdings reflected on wealth platforms. Galaxy has processed a handful of transactions, Bloomberg added, citing Michael Harvey. Some clients shift only a slice of holdings; a “subset” consolidates entirely because “it’s the easiest way” to hold going forward, Mitchnick told Bloomberg. Bitwise President Teddy Fusaro said there are “benefits of having things in the traditional financial system,” including how clients are serviced by private banks. Banks already play a limited role in facilitating these trades — particularly on creations — even as only non-bank broker-dealers can currently complete the full process, Bloomberg added. Neither BlackRock, Bitwise nor Galaxy immediately responded to CoinDesk's request for comment.

Title: DWS Transforms $2.5M ESG ETF into Something Much Different
URL: https://www.thedailyupside.com/etf/industry-news-etf/dws-transforms-2-5m-esg-etf-into-something-much-different/
Time Published: 2025-10-22T10:00:00Z

Asset managers have repurposed sustainable funds amid a pullback from them in the US. This change is more substantial than most. Emile Hallez emile@thedailyupside.com It’s not that unusual to change one’s appearance: Just ask all the bros who can’t wait to stop shaving in Movember. But if a fund got a different name, ticker, benchmark and investment process, is it still the same fund, or just a way of seeding a new product? One DWS Xtrackers ETF is having something of an identity crisis, going from a value ESG mandate to being an S&P 100 fund that simply cuts out the biggest names in the index. And that’s after a name change the fund already had earlier this year. On Dec. 19, the Xtrackers S&P 500 Value Scored & Screened ETF (SNPV), which until February had been the S&P 500 Value ESG ETF, will become the S&P 100 Ex Top 20 ETF (XOEX). Whew. It’s common for asset managers to change funds’ names and investment strategies. That has all but been the norm amid a pullback in the US from sustainable and ESG mandates, with many products removing any hint of those labels. The trend was in the opposite direction a few years ago, when seemingly every fund shop wanted in on ESG, and many existing products saw slight modifications to reflect that. This year, however, the Janus Henderson Responsible International Dividend Fund dropped “Responsible” from its name, and the BlackRock Sustainable Balanced Fund scrapped “Sustainable.” Both of those funds backed off from ESG-related goals, according to a Morningstar analysis. Other products, such as the Sprott Critical Materials ETF and Cromwell Foresight Global Infrastructure Fund, had name changes but retained their investment strategies. Assets have been pouring out of US sustainable and ESG-themed products in recent years, and small funds have been closing : The move by DWS to morph its ETF into essentially a different product stands out from the more measured changes many issuers have made in repurposing funds. Nonetheless, SNPV’s metamorphosis won’t affect too many investors, as it represents just $2.5 million in assets. DWS, through a PR firm, declined to comment. However, the fund’s new strategy aligns it somewhat with others this year that have addressed the extreme concentration in market-cap-weighted indexes of just a few companies, like Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon. What Are Sustainable Investors to Do? Clearly, there are fewer ESG-related funds on the market today than just a few years ago. But investors still have choices, as asset managers dedicated to the space aren’t leaving. “There are big players out there like Parnassus, Calvert, etc., who are starting to offer ETFs. This is a huge shift and helps open the space to investors who want a more tax-friendly approach and lower investment minimums,” said Justin Horowitz, owner of Just Advising, which offers an ethical investing option. “Other mainstream names, like BlackRock, still offer their ESG funds, but it does seem harder to find them through their website nowadays.” Soon, ETF shareholders may opt for proxy policies that could support (or oppose) issues like the $1 trillion Tesla pay package for Elon Musk. Some of the largest S&P 500-based funds lost billions this year as institutional investors sought out cheaper alternatives. The rare earths industry is booming as the materials are used less in electric vehicles and more in AI data centers. Tokenized securities are moving closer to a reality as issuers make plans to bring more assets and funds on-chain. Even with the lights out at the SEC, it’s unlikely that ETF issuers seeking 3x and 5x funds will sail through the approval process. The new VanEck TruSector ETFs invest in stocks and other ETFs to maximize exposure to individual companies and reflect actual market caps. No one knows the future, but high inflation could make some investments virtually worthless. As regulators have warmed up to crypto and assets have poured into ETFs, advisors who ignore the trend risk losing clients, proponents said. Analysts from JPMorgan on Monday wrote that levered ETFs might worsen macro swings by increasing intraday volatility. The firm has waited until now to expand its US product line as sales trends are favoring ETFs over many mutual funds. As the iShares Bitcoin Trust nears the milestone, dozens of spot-price crypto ETFs are being prepped to come to market. Low-fee products tracking indexes have outperformed their higher-fee ETF counterparts and have raked in assets. © 2025 The Daily Upside

Title: Bitcoin ETFs record $477M in inflows after four days of outflows
URL: https://coinjournal.net/news/bitcoin-etfs-record-477m-in-inflows-after-four-days-of-outflows/
Time Published: 2025-10-22T08:16:05Z
Full Content:
Spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US registered strong inflows on Tuesday, reversing the previous week’s outflow trend. According to data from Farside Investors, total daily net inflows reached $477.2 million, signalling renewed investor confidence following a period of volatility in the crypto market. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) led the inflows with $210.9 million, while the Ark & 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) followed with $162.8 million. Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) also recorded $34.15 million in new investments. The inflows come after several consecutive sessions of net withdrawals across spot crypto ETFs, which collectively lost over $1 billion in recent days as persistent trade tensions between the US and China weighed on investor sentiment. Despite the rebound in inflows, overall trading activity remained elevated. Bitcoin ETFs posted $7.41 billion in total trade volume on Tuesday. Throughout October, daily trading volumes have fluctuated between $5 billion and $9.78 billion — significantly higher than the $2 billion to $4 billion range seen in September. Spot Ethereum ETFs also saw renewed investor participation. On Tuesday, the funds collectively attracted $141.6 million in net inflows, according to Farside data. Fidelity’s FETH accounted for the largest portion at $59 million, while additional inflows came from funds operated by BlackRock, Grayscale, and VanEck. The combined rebound across Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs suggests that institutional appetite for crypto exposure remains strong despite recent price corrections. At the time of writing on Wednesday, Bitcoin (BTC) was trading around $108,500, stabilising after facing resistance the previous day. The cryptocurrency found support near the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $106,453, drawn from its April low of $74,508 to its record high of $126,199. BTC rebounded nearly 4% by Monday but later slipped 2% on Tuesday after being rejected from the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $113,606. If the downward momentum continues, Bitcoin could revisit support near $106,453. A decisive close below this level may open the door for further declines toward the October 10 low of $102,000. Ethereum (ETH) has also shown signs of weakness, extending its recent correction. After retreating by more than 4% last week from resistance at $4,232, the cryptocurrency continued to slide by another 3% through Tuesday. ETH was trading around $3,847 on Wednesday. Should the downward trend persist, Ethereum may test the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $3,593, which aligns closely with the 200-day EMA — a key area that could determine whether the broader trend remains intact or shifts further bearish.

Title: Reimagined 1970s three-bed apartment in the heart of Ballsbridge for €800,000

One of Dublin 4’s most sought after addresses, Pembroke Road, is a short stroll to cafes and restaurants on Baggot Street Upper and a short walk up the two bridges in either direction on the Grand Canal will take you to local Dart and Luas stops. A 15-minute stroll will have you in the centre of St Stephen’s Green, the Aviva Stadium for rugby internationals and the villages of Ranelagh, Donnybrook and Sandymount, all of which have a great selection of pubs and restaurants. Number 75 Pembroke Road is set well back from the road itself. It originally had an office block to one side, which was replaced in the 1970s with a set of apartments, though is accessed through the original period doorway. Located just off the junction triangle of Northumberland, Lansdowne and Pembroke Roads, it’s as smack bang in the centre of Ballsbridge as you can get. Sharing its site with 30 other units, number 21 Pembroke Court is a second-floor dual aspect apartment that has just been released to the market through estate agent Owen Reilly. It has three bedrooms and a generous 97sq m (1,044sq ft) of floor space that has undergone a recent transformation since its owner purchased the unit in early 2021, for €525,000, according to the Property Price Register. It’s a smashing renovation of a 1970s unit that had little in the way of features until its owners gave it a stylish upgrade: “It was easy to see its potential, even though nothing had been done since the 1970s,” says its owner, adding “you don’t always get the luxury of all-square rooms, with proper windows that overlook a garden, but that, and the location made us buy”. With the help of Belgradian architectural duo Tihomir Dicic and Iva Njunic, the entire space has been reimagined to a superb, spacious three-bedroom contemporary apartment in the heart of one of the most desirable addresses in Dublin. By removing small hallways, the entire unit was opened up to give a lovely internal flow with the benefit of lots of light from large windows, all of which have been replaced with more energy-efficient aluclad units. When the walls were being insulated and upgraded, builders discovered the original brick walls of the period property next door. With advice from the architects that it could be exposed, and though it took “lots of cleaning and sealing” it is now a standout feature in the apartment, which owners have highlighted with the use of smart LED lights in an overhead shadow gap. In fact, thoughtful lighting – as 1970s ceilings are rarely high – was one of the many considerations when this unit was being refurbished. Central to the living space – off the dining and kitchen area – is a modular unit the family sourced from Nordic Elements in Blackrock, which sits so well around the television that you would think it was custom made for the room. Solid oak floors run through the C1-rated apartment, which has a streamlined kitchen with Bosch appliances and the focus on storage at design stage, allows the whole place to be streamlined and clutter free – despite this being home to a family with young children. Its three bedrooms comprise of two doubles and a single, and the family who live here say they were amazed at how the architects managed to rearrange the space to accommodate an en suite and so much storage in their home. Even the bathrooms are luxuriously subtle in a pared back kind of way, with focus on storage and illuminating soft tones from the wood. The owners, who are moving due to a growing family, have loved their time here – especially the garden out front where their children play – and say they live a mostly car-free life due to the location. This unit shows what a 1970s apartment can become with a bit of thought, and is now seeking €800,000 through Owen Reilly.

Share this article Bitcoin whales executed around $3 billion in ETF trades through BlackRock’s $IBIT, a spot Bitcoin ETF, using portfolio trade mechanisms that offer significant portfolio benefits, Bloomberg reported today. The trades allow large Bitcoin holders to convert their holdings directly into ETF shares through custom creation processes. BlackRock has been facilitating these in-kind creations for $IBIT, enabling Bitcoin whales to seamlessly integrate their holdings into traditional finance portfolios. The structure mirrors portfolio trades commonly used in bond markets, where assets are exchanged directly rather than through cash transactions. The portfolio trade mechanism provides Bitcoin whales with benefits including enhanced liquidity and tax efficiencies. These custom ETF creation methods have gained traction in crypto markets as institutional investors seek regulated investment vehicles for their digital asset holdings. BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF has seen heightened institutional interest as traditional finance firms adapt to cryptocurrency integrations through ETF structures. The asset management giant has been expanding its crypto offerings in response to evolving investor demands for regulated Bitcoin exposure. Sign in to your account Don’t have an account?

PHOTO: GIC Published Oct 22, 2025, 08:44 AM Updated Oct 22, 2025, 05:57 PM London – Deep-pocketed sovereign wealth funds are helping drive a resurgence in dealmaking that has taken global merger and acquisition (M&A) volumes past US$3.5 trillion (S$4.5 trillion) in 2025. The M&A volume is now up 34 per cent this year, putting 2025 on track to be the best year since 2021, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. More than US$1.3 trillion in transactions were recorded in the third quarter, driven by a few mega deals. State-backed funds from the Middle East and Asia, including Singapore, provided firepower for some of 2025’s biggest transactions. Blackstone and TPG agreed on Oct 21 to acquire medical-device maker Hologic for as much as US$18.3 billion including debt, with Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (Adia) and Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC taking minority stakes. Last week, BlackRock teamed up with Singapore’s investment company Temasek and MGX, an artificial intelligence investment firm set up by Abu Dhabi’s Mubadala Investment, on a US$40 billion deal for Aligned Data Centres. US$40 billion deal for Aligned Data Centres The week before, Carlyle Group partnered with Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) to buy control of BASF’s coatings business in a deal valuing the unit at €7.7 billion (S$11.6 billion). It was only in September that Saudi Arabia’s sovereign fund agreed to take video-game maker Electronic Arts private in a US$55 billion leveraged buyout – the biggest ever. Sovereign wealth funds have been building out their internal deal teams as they seek to do more direct investments, giving them a chance to profit without having to pay fees to Wall Street. They are among the biggest backers of private equity funds, and have squeezed out concessions that force the buyout firms to give them opportunities to invest alongside them in return for the cash they provide. The funds have been particularly active in tech. In August, private equity giant Thoma Bravo got backing from Adia for its roughly US$12 billion acquisition of human-resource software provider Dayforce. Abu Dhabi’s state-backed MGX has invested in OpenAI at a US$500 billion valuation. It has also backed Mr Elon Musk’s xAI and plans to contribute to US President Donald Trump’s Stargate venture. GIC and QIA have put money into rival AI start-up Anthropic. Rainmakers at the top investment banks said they expect the flurry of takeovers to continue. Goldman Sachs Group is predicting a major ramp-up in dealmaking towards the end of 2025, with a chance that 2026 will be a record year for M&A. Sovereign investors are on the hunt for more deals. Mubadala’s asset management arm is exploring an acquisition of Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings, the billboard operator with a market value of around US$930 million. And they are looking beyond takeovers, with the Qatari sovereign fund joining a more than US$2 billion fundraising for Hollywood superagent Ari Emanuel’s new company, alongside other investors like Apollo Global Management and Ares Management Corporation.

Title: Trump rebukes “young lady” reporter questioning Argentina bailout as farmers rips his beef deal
URL: https://www.dailydot.com/viral-politics/trump-backlash-beef-trade-deal-argentina/
Time Published: 2025-10-21T18:00:00Z
Full Content:
Rachel Kiley President Donald Trump is facing renewed backlash for his support of Argentina following a tone deaf comment he made about a potential beef trade deal with the country. Trump has been publicly mulling over the possibility of beginning to import beef from Argentina as a way to bring down prices at U.S. grocery stores. “If we buy some beef now—I’m not talking about that much—from Argentina, it would help Argentina, which we consider a very good country, a very good ally,” he said over the weekend. No deal has officially been made as of yet, but even the idea of it is causing an uproar among farmers who already feel betrayed and misled by the allegedly “America First” president. A reporter recently questioned Trump about this backlash, asking, “What do you have to say to U.S. farmers who feel that the deal is benefiting Argentina more than it does them—” “Look, Argentina’s fighting for its life, young lady,” he said, cutting her off. “You don’t know anything about it. They’re fighting for their life.” He went on to claim that “nothing’s benefiting Argentina” and that he wants to “help them survive in a free world,” before letting his true motivation slip. “I happen to like the president of Argentina,” he said. “I think he’s trying to do the best he can. But don’t make it sound like they’re doing great. They’re dying, alright? They’re dying.” The reporter’s identity could not immediately be confirmed. Q: What do you have to say to farmers who feel that the deal is benefitting Argentina more than it is them?TRUMP: Look, Argentina is fighting for its life, young lady. You don’t know anything about it. You understand what that means? They are dying pic.twitter.com/1DMyaHtcTR Trade wars have led to China, previously the largest buyer of U.S. soybeans, halting its purchases. Instead, they’re now getting soybeans from Brazil and Argentina. Adding insult to injury, the Trump administration has authorized a $20 billion currency swap for Argentina while U.S. farmers continue to struggle. And Trump himself has repeatedly made it clear that this help is motivated by his ideological allyship with Argentina’s president, Javier Milei. “Just helping a great philosophy take over a great country,” he recently said, while warning U.S. financial support for the country would drop if Argentinian politics shift left. Putting this relationship and Argentina’s economy above struggling Americans has angered some farmers, with many worrying that creating a beef deal with Argentina will only exacerbate an already bad situation for rural Americans. “President Trump’s plan to buy beef from Argentina is a betrayal of the American rancher,” Farm Action’s Senior Director of Programs, Christian Lovell, said in a press release. “The U.S. beef industry is dominated by four major meatpackers that control roughly 85% of the market. This consolidation allows them to suppress prices paid to ranchers while keeping consumer prices high. Importing more beef into this rigged system will not lower costs for families or restore fair markets for producers.” As frustrated as farmers may be, there’s been a fair amount of frustration aimed at them from other Americans, as well, considering many of them voted for him despite being warned that it would hurt the economy and their own bottom line. Still, that doesn’t mean people are keen on Trump throwing money at Argentina while gutting American programs—or that anyone was impressed by his condescending response to the reporter who actually asked him about it. The tone of “young lady” here then calling the reporter stupid is quite the combo https://t.co/dC6GDoDXts it’s quite funny that argentina’s current situation is a direct result of Milei’s policy. Farmers: We’re struggling. Trump: Okay, but have you tried being Argentina?MAGA farmers voted for the guy who bankrupted casinos, and they’re shocked he’s bankrupting them too. https://t.co/4Rw1LVBB8c I think the media should be doing a better job of explaining that Argentina is “fighting for it’s life” because they followed right wing policies which caused their economy to collapse. https://t.co/g2sxwYlaKY Why would Trump buy beef from Argentina while US farmers struggle?Maybe it’s because the Trump-connected fund managers at BlackRock, Fidelity and Pimco, and his mega-wealthy friends are heavily invested in Argentina.Always follow the money and you’ll find Trump’s corruption. https://t.co/4SM5nFaP4q Just found out that the first A in MAGA stands for Argentina.

You can stream and download our full conversation, including any podcast extras, on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube, and Bloomberg. All of our earlier podcasts on your favorite pod hosts can be found here. ~~~ This is Masters in Business with Barry Ritholtz on Bloomberg Radio this Barry Ritholtz: This Week on the podcast. Yet another extra special guest, Henry Ward, is CEO and co-founder of Carta. They’re the company that keeps track of cap tables, compensation, valuation, liquidity for over 50,000 private companies. They work with 8,500 investment firms and over two and a half million equity holders to track all of this crucial information. It’s kind kind of hard to imagine that they were doing this manually with stock certificates before Carta came along and digitized everything and put it all on the cloud. Fascinating company. Fascinating guy. I thought this was really a great conversation. With no further ado, the CEO and co-founder of Carta Henry Ward, welcome to Bloomberg. Henry Ward: Thanks for having me. Barry Ritholtz: Well, thanks so much for doing this. It’s been a crazy week with the UN and everything, so I’m glad you, you guys fought your way over. But I wanna start talking a little bit about your education and background. A bachelor’s in mathematics and computer science from University of Michigan, go Blue and MSC in market finance from EDHEC. I am less familiar with Ed Heck than I am with Ish. What was the original career plan? Henry Ward: You know, I went to University of Michigan originally to be a math major. Technically, my, my degree on my transcripts has a bachelor’s of general studies. ’cause at that time to get a math degree, you were in the literature of Science and Arts College and you had to take two years of a foreign language. And I failed Japanese three times, tried Spanish, failed that twice. And my counselor was, and at the time I was supposed to go in the Marines and they said, look, I said to my counselor, you, I just need to graduate. And they said, well, look, if you switch to a general studies degree, you can, you can graduate. ’cause you have enough credits. It’s kind of a generalist degree. ’cause you took a bunch of math, computer science and linguistics and you can graduate next year. And, and I said, let’s do that. So it was me and 13 football players that graduated with a general studies degree that year. But, but the, my passion had always been math. I thought I’d be a mathematician. My roommate was a computer scientist. He got me into computers and, and then I went into software engineering. Barry Ritholtz: So two questions. First, did you end up in the Marines? Henry Ward: I joined the Marines out of high school as an enlisted man. I, I went to Paris Island and then I later went into what’s called Platoon Leaders course, which is like the Marine Corps version of rotc. I did that. But when I finally graduated, and sometimes I, I regret this, you know, you kind of look back at old decisions and at the time, four years, four more years and the Marines seemed like an eternity. Right now it seems like nothing book of an eye Barry Ritholtz: Would be, it would be gone, right? Henry Ward: Yeah. I ended up deciding to pay back my, my GI bill because this was 2000. I graduated in 1999. My signing bonus paid off my entire college debt at the time, and I decided to go that route. So I, I never Barry Ritholtz: Where was the signing bonus? Where’d you go? Henry Ward: I went to a company called Trilogy out Austin, Texas. And it was an incredibly formative experience for me. I it was a very smart company. They, they were gonna be the Google of the South for a variety of reasons. It didn’t quite work out for them. They, the CEO is still there though, running Trilogy and it’s a great private privately held company. But yeah, that’s what took me into, into Texas. Barry Ritholtz: So I hear you saying you didn’t do well with languages with Japanese, with Spanish, but am I reading this correctly? Did you get your masters, your MSC in France? Henry Ward: Yeah, I did because the, the business schools in France are mostly taught in English. Huh. And English is hard enough for me. So I had to, I had to stick with, with an English business school. The plan was never to go to business school. I, I wanted to ride my bicycle in southern France. It was a big tour to France. Watch here. I loved riding my bike. My fiance now, ex ex-wife was like, well, hey, if we’re gonna go, I convinced her to come with me. We’re gonna be productive. Let’s go to business school while you train for the Iron Man and do all those things. And, Barry Ritholtz: And you did all of that? Henry Ward: Yeah. So we, we, but it was a French business school, so there wasn’t a lot of work. There was a lot of riding, a lot of, a lot of eating bread. It was, it was a great couple years. Barry Ritholtz: That’s a kind of fascinating mix of technical, financial, financial training, Marines and overseas study. How did that experience shape the way you think about building companies? Henry Ward: You know, I, I realized pretty quickly, I, I, I’m not good at the military. My father was an army officer for a long time, and he used to tell me, you know, and the difference between military life and civilian life is in military life, you’re, you’re judged on the, the worst thing you do in civilian life, or certainly in startups. You’re judged on the best thing you do. And, and I’m very much, I do one or two things really well versus I do many things, you know, not wrong. And so I quickly realized the military was not not the right place for me. Investment banking was not the right place for me. I, I went to an investment bank after grad school, and then I discovered entrepreneurship sort of accidentally. And I, I realized this is what I was meant to do. Successful or unsuccessful. This is what I was meant to do. Barry Ritholtz: So let’s talk about the predecessor firm to Carta second site, a portfolio optimization platform. You launched that not long after grad school. How did that experience influence how you approached the next venture? How did it affect what your plans were for scaling Carta? Henry Ward: The idea for second site was, it was like a wealth front or a betterment, one of these robo-advisors. But you know, Andy and Josh did a, a much better job than I I did, my company failed. And what I, what kind of rose outta the ashes of that was, and I got through the tr of depression after closing. It was, I couldn’t imagine doing anything else as a completely failed founder. I just wanted to do it again. And Carta came out of that experience. And it, it was one of these interesting things where the conventional wisdom for founders is you fall in love with a problem and entrepreneurship is a vehicle with which to that solve that problem. I was different. I fell in love with entrepreneurship. I fell in love with building a startup, and I just needed a problem. The problem was a vehicle with which to be a, a founder. And that really shapes how Carta is today. We’re a heat seeking missile going after any problem we can find to solve to keep the business moving forward. And, and I, I talk a lot to early stage founders about this, is which one are you, are you in love with the being a founder? Are you in love with the problem? And both come with strengths and weaknesses. If you’re in love with being the, in the problem, you know, you’re passionate about the problem, you’ll grind through the, the bad stages of being a founder to solve this problem. The, the downside is if the problem isn’t actually that valuable, you kind of get stuck entrenched in this problem, right? And many founders burn and crash in that. The other side for me is, you know, because I’m not, I’ll do, I’ll work on any problem to, to move the company forward. There’s often not a coherent strategy. It’s like, I’ll grab a problem over here, I’ll grab a problem over there. And, and you can see it in the kind of diversity for, for a $500 million business, we have a, a large number of SKUs and business lines. And it’s because we shoot at a lot of different targets. Barry Ritholtz: So let’s talk about the initial target. How did you come up with the idea, hey, these cap tables, all the data around comp and valuation and VC investing. No one is really tracking this in a consistent, intelligent way. Like, what was that aha moment? Henry Ward: I was working with Manu Kumar over at Canine Ventures on the, my previous company. And when we shut that down and, and we were talking about what am I gonna do next? He pointed out this cap table problem and, and was like, Hey, this is a real problem. I think you should solve it. Really? Yeah. Yeah. That’s fascinating. I’ll, I’ll invest in it. And, and he, he gave me this, this problem set to go after. And I, I spent a few months working on it and learning about it. What was really interesting was the first version of it was not cap table. So that’s what everybody knows us for. The first version actually was PayPal for equity. It was, instead of, back then you used to mail a paper stock certificate, just like we used to do with the railroads, right? And it cost $50 in FedEx fees and a hundred bucks for the paralegal to print it. Barry Ritholtz: And somebody had to file it in a cabinet. And we were like, we said, Hey, why are we email or, you know, FedExing paper stock certificates, let’s just email it. And, and that was the initial idea. And we realized companies didn’t care that much. We thought the competition was FedEx. They didn’t care that much about it, but they said, well, hey, if you’re, you’re emailing all this stuff, can you just put all of it into a table and show it to me? And we’re like, yeah, we can do that. That sounds pretty good. And that was the thing that had product market fit, was just showing them everything we issued. And then once you had the cap table of the company, my, my heat seeking missile instincts were like, well, what else could we do? And then we launched four nine A and stock option expense accounting and employee management and cart total compensation and QSBS. And suddenly you could do so many things around this core system of record called the Cap Table. Huh. Barry Ritholtz: So fascinating. What was it like scaling that? What sort of technology issues did you run into? How much of the data you were finding? Was it all hand assembled or was there any mass amount of data that made it easy to navigate? What, what were the next few steps ? Henry Ward: I often tell earlier stage founders, you know, being a, you know, we’re about 2000 employees now. The problems I deal with are no different than the early stage. They’re just bigger, faster, harder. But they’re the same, same set of problems. I I do the same thing every day than an early stage founder does. And it’s really simple. It’s talk to customers, figure out their problems, solve the product, build the product to solve their problems and make them happy. And that’s just it. It is just rinse and repeat. Everything else is just, you know, overhead to building a, a a, building a company. And so these days, you know, I’m in New York for, for a few days, half my meetings are our customer meetings. Barry Ritholtz: So this isn’t just obviously public companies. This is public and private companies. How do they differ? My assumption is it’s easier to track and access public companies data. What do you do on the private side? Henry Ward: Public company data and, you know, Bloomberg’s a a great, you know, example of this is, is so ubiquitous and it’s how do we manage this incredible set of data across massive ecosystems and networks in the public markets. Private markets is very different. It’s, it’s private there, there’s no central place to access all this data. We have a lot of the data on what’s happening in the private markets, particularly around venture capital and private equity. But because it’s private, we can’t share it. And that is the very unique interesting thing about what we do is we track all the much of the same data that like a Bloomberg would track, but we can’t share it with anybody. And that’s the, that’s, many people have asked me, Hey, how come you haven’t done blockchain? You know, blockchain seems like an obvious thing for a cap table to be put on. And the reason is our, our customers pay us to fix things when they’re broken. And don’t tell anybody about, tell, don’t tell anybody about it. And blockchain is immutable and public. And that’s, that’s the big difference between private and public. Barry Ritholtz: Really interesting. What was the hardest problem in assembling a private market set of data and cap tables across the whole technology ecosystem? Henry Ward: The big issue we had early was what I’ll call the dematerialization of, of private stock. So the, the model that we think we look at is when Nixon pulled us off the gold standard, he dematerialized cash. You know, now the Federal Reserve could just create cash because cash was now put into the cloud. They could create money, they could do what, they could move money around without actually moving physical inventory. They dematerialized cash and gold and put it in the cloud. And this was in the seventies. We think of us as doing the same thing. Was everything in private markets until Carta was, was cash, it was paper equity, it was contracts, it was PDFs, it was documents. And we dematerialize that. We put it all in the cloud. So now everything could be moved around seamlessly. Getting the ecosystem of venture capital to believe in the dematerialization of private, private equity and private capital was the hardest part. ’cause it sounds crazy today, but in 2012 and 13, lawyers were like, no, but you, you have to have a, a green stock certificate with an embroider around it. Like that’s what we’ve been doing literally for 200 years. I would like, who are you to change this? Barry Ritholtz: I would’ve thought if anybody would be amenable to let’s go from physical paper to digital, it would be Silicon Valley venture capitalists. They were pushing back or their lawyers were pushing back. Henry Ward: The Lawyers are pushing back. But, but even the venture capitalists, ’cause the, the venture capitalists are, they’re very interesting because they are stewards of what the future will be and prognosticators of it, but they’re not users of it. And it’s one of these things I I say a lot about AI is everybody thinks AI will change everybody’s job except their own. And, and venture is the same. Like, oh, you know, all the companies should be using technology, but we don’t because we’re just pros. Barry Ritholtz: we’re the professionals. We don’t need it. Exactly. We’re smarter than everybody else. Exactly. What was the aha moment where that ecosystem that was kind of pushing back said, oh, this is really useful and helpful. Yes, let’s dematerialize, let’s go digital. Henry Ward: It was the grassroots, the the way we got it going was the grassroots efforts of startups saying, Hey, they, they didn’t understand that they were buying into a dematerialization model, but what they understood was, Hey, I can track my cap table cheaper, faster, better on Carta than anything else. And so they just came, came to us. That was the wedge, the net, the kind of the golden phrase is, you know, come, come for the tool, stay for the network. So the tool, the wedge was just better cap table management for one 10th of the cost. And then the network is, once everybody started converging on the cap tables, it became the new standard. So now it’s a weird world, just like, it’s a weird, weird, weird world to say that, you know, know we had paper stocks there to give it and that was the right way to do it. It is now a weird world to say, oh well why wouldn’t we put it in the database on the cloud? Barry Ritholtz: And that becomes a self-reinforcing flywheel. You get a critical mass and then you could go out in, in all sorts of directions from from there. Henry Ward: That’s right. And nobody knows that better than, than Bloomberg and Mr. Bloomberg. ’cause that’s exactly what Bloomberg did. Barry Ritholtz: That’s exactly right. Started with the data… Coming up, we continue our conversation with Henry Ward, CEO and co-founder of Carta, talking about how a simple cap table management became an essential part of the startup world ~~~ Barry Ritholtz: My extra special guest today is Henry Ward. He is the CEO and co-founder of Carta. They help manage cap tables and so much more when it comes to both public and private corporate data. So let’s talk a little bit about this. You start with a simple capital table management kind of unglamorous, but sounds important, essential. Hey, I need to know how many shareholders I have, who owns what, what VCs, what, what employees own, how much stock, like I would’ve thought that was around for 30, 40 years. How has nobody been doing that for, you know, you could practically go back to, you know, the launch of Intel 40 years ago. How has this not been a thing? Henry Ward: The one of the most common questions I got when I was raising money in the early days for this idea was, hey, this sounds kind of obvious. Why has nobody done this before? Right. And I, I, my answer was somewhat cheeky. And I, I always would say, how, how would I know I’m doing it? And you know, I’m the last person in the world that would know the answer to this. You should ask the SE 6.9 billion other people in the world that haven’t done it. Who chose not to, right. Who chose not to. And I’m, I’m a least qualified person. I, I think it’s just one of these inner innovator dilemma problems that the people that should have solved this should have been the investment banks. That should have been the ne the stock VCs. Stock exchanges vc, sure. Maybe even the VCs. Yeah. Somebody, somebody should have solved it, but you know, who’s going to do paper stock certificates? Like it just, it’s so somebody Barry Ritholtz: Had a clerk had to have a clerk or a junior researcher putting this together somewhere and had to realize there was some value to both the firm and various outside startups for, it’s kind of shocking Henry Ward: For sure. But, but the, your, your point so well made, Barry is the kind of person that would be filing paper stock certificates would never come up with the idea of replacing them. And so you, you need this, this is the magic of a, a founder, a visionary founder is, is you need that connection of they, they know enough about technology to, to know what technology can do, but they don’t know enough about the current process that they think it’s unchangeable. And that’s the, you, you know, there’s certain level of intelligence and a certain level of stupidity that you need to get that, that chemical quotient. Right. Barry Ritholtz: So how did you convince investors that, hey, this is worthwhile, this should exist. It doesn’t, please invest in this. It’s worth building. Henry Ward: Most investors said, Hey, the, the even I believe you can build a cap table product and make some money and sell it, but it, the, the market size is too small. How many cap tables can you actually sell? And the, the pitch was, well, hey, this is, this is a two-part story. Part one is win the cap tables. Part two is if you win the cap tables, then we can go build at the time what we called the NASDAQ for private markets. The, the stock exchange to trade the, these, these shares. And our thesis then was the reason why there were many stock market companies before us, but none of them had actually owned the settlement. They hadn’t owned the cap table itself. And so they had to connect, match, and settle these things offline. And by owning the cap table, we could digitize the entire settlement process for these companies. But we, you had to do the hard work of winning the cap table business first. We were wrong. It turned out the cap table business was way bigger than we and investors thought. Today it’s a $350 million business. Wow. But the, the stock market that everybody thought was gonna be, you know, a billion dollar business is zero for us. 00:19:37 [Speaker Changed] That, that’s unbelievable. Yeah. The, you know, VCs love to toss around tam, total addressable market. Again, kind of shocking that people right in the middle of this surrounded by tens of thousands of companies in California and Silicon Valley completely underestimated the total addressable market. Yeah. That, that’s just shocking to me. Let’s talk about the, the income stream you set up in the beginning. This was a fee per stock certificate business. You guys changed this to a subscription model. Tell us about the factors that drove those changes and how it affected the steadiness of your income stream. 00:20:19 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, so we, we thought we were competing against FedEx. And so instead of paying $60 to FedEx to FedEx a stock certific, you’ll pay us $20 to email it. It worked. People would pay for it. What was really hard about it though is it’s a transactional business. It’s very hard to, to manage the transactional business. And it was very volatile. And we also quickly realized that we wanted to move to a subscription based business. ’cause we needed to bundle other things that were, were more subscription based, like 4 0 9 a valuations and expense accounting and other services we were doing. But we were, we were two years in and, you know, at the time I think we had maybe 2000 customers that were all paying us 20 bucks. And we realized this was like a, a crucible moment for us. If we didn’t change the business model, we wouldn’t, we wouldn’t survive. 00:21:06 And we emailed all of our customers from me. I emailed all 2000 customers and I said, Hey, I made a mistake. I I priced this wrong for you and I I need to change from the $20 per certificate to, you know, X dollars per year. And, and everybody had a, a price that they, we custom already set up for them. So we didn’t even ask ’em, we just said, we’re moving you starting next month to the subscription model. And it was a very scary, scary thing to do. ’cause you don’t know what your customers are gonna do. Right? You, you literally changed the agreement in the mid-flight. And I, I explained in this long email, I said, I, I made a mistake. If I keep charging you this way, I’m gonna go outta business and I need to move you over to this. And I’m very sorry I made this mistake. I hope I understand if you decide to leave us, but I hope, I hope you won’t. And it was remarkable. We lost almost no customers. Wow. And I, I have some of these saved and framed where customers came back and said, you know, we’re so glad you did this ’cause we were wondering if you were gonna run out of business. Like we thought, you know, this pricing was wrong. It didn’t make any sense making, 00:22:19 [Speaker Changed] So the subscription model allows them to just keep doing repeat business and no one has to track, oh, we did these six companies and it’s however much it is. No, here’s our monthly fee and we can do as many companies as we have to work 00:22:33 [Speaker Changed] With. They, they have a monthly ex annual fee for most of them. They pay annually, they, they renew and based on the size of the cap table at that renewal, they, they just get a renewal notice. And, and it’s interesting, you know, eight years ago we were 10 x cheaper than the lawyers. Now we’re still eight x cheaper than the lawyers. But now it’s, it’s just a different, different world. People are used to software now. And it’s, it’s that, that, you know, 10 years ago is a, is a weird thing for these companies to pay a subscription fee for legal software. And today it’s super, super common. Do 00:23:06 [Speaker Changed] You really think about this as legal software? It, I mean it obviously has ramifications in law, but it really seems more like it’s a combination of hey, it, it’s business, it’s investing, it’s accounting. How, how do you contextualize what space you’re actually in 00:23:26 [Speaker Changed] It? It’s a great question. I I think we started as legal software and people thought of us as legal software. I think over the first five years we transitioned the concept of cap table from a legal solution to a financial solution. So we sort of categorize ourselves in the FinTech world. I think today, when you look at cap tables, our fund administration and fund accounting business, our LP business and all the, the, the software that we sell as a platform into private, private equity, private credit venture capital. I, I think of us now as a, as a software infrastructure business, you know, we, we, we sell, we’re we’re more similar to a NetSuite or even a Google suite than we are to a legal tech company or a 00:24:12 [Speaker Changed] Makes a lot of sense and save on legal fees. So, so back, let’s call it about eight years ago you were called e shares, which kind of intuitively makes a lot of sense. What was behind the rebranding? Why did you go from eShares to Carta in 2017? 00:24:31 [Speaker Changed] The, we liked eShares because it, it was an electronic share, you know, instead of paper. And it made a ton of sense. In 2017, we kind of realized we wanted to do way more than electronic shares. So we knew we needed a new name. We were also pushed on it because we didn’t own eshares.com. We owned eShares inc.com and there was a domain squatter on eshares.com. 00:24:55 [Speaker Changed] What did they want for it? 00:24:57 [Speaker Changed] They wanted, initially I think it was a million bucks when we had, we had $2 million raised total. And then as soon as we raised more money, it became $10 million. Oh really? And so it was just every single time we were trying to get more and we just couldn’t, couldn’t do business. And so we decided we needed to change the name and we came up with Carta and we were able to buy it for I think 75,000 bucks. And it was great. 00:25:21 [Speaker Changed] Wow. That’s fantastic. Did, did eShares ever get sold? 00:25:25 [Speaker Changed] I don’t think so. It is a great question. I don’t know if it’s still, I haven’t been there in a long time. It 00:25:30 [Speaker Changed] Just goes to show you, you know, you have to leave a little bit on money on the table if you try and squeeze every last penny end up with nothing. Exactly. So you guys, I mentioned in the original introduction, Carta serves 50,000 companies, 8,500 firms, millions and millions of equity holders. Starting out with that first $2 million raise, it appears that you’ve scaled from a, a little niche solution to a giant platform for private companies. What was the biggest growth pains in in that scaling that up? 00:26:04 [Speaker Changed] It’s all of them. We scaling a company, I, I think I, I love Jensen at Nvidia and I got to see ’em speak and you know, someone was asked him about would he do it again? And, and you know, he’s one of the most successful entrepreneurs of our generation. And he goes, if I knew what it would take, I wouldn’t have done it again. Really. And yeah, and you know, it’s, I think Mark Andreessen calls it, it’s, it’s eating glass until you, you enjoy the taste of your own blood. So it, it’s, you know, ev every day I, there’s sort of this funny thing where people are like, well what was it like to scale? And I’m like, I’m still doing it. Like, like we’re, you know, and, and it’s, you know, getting in at, you know, 10 o’clock last night from a 4:00 AM start. It’s, you know, talking to customers, it’s hiring, firing, you know, uncomfortable conversations, you know, board mechanics. It’s, it’s all the same. It’s just more harder, faster. 00:26:59 [Speaker Changed] Is andreessen’s quote eating glass till you like the taste of your own blood? Is that accurate? Or is it a little hyperbolic? 00:27:06 [Speaker Changed] You know, I think, so I talk a lot to founders about this, where the, the founders that want to be founders for the money, we all know that the expected value of being an entrepreneur is, is below pursuing a career far, far below the better business bureau 00:27:22 [Speaker Changed] Actually well sold such a large percentage fail Exactly at the gate. So that’s exactly, we all the survivorship bias of, we see the ones that have succeeded. That’s just the top of the iceberg. You don’t see everything below the waterline. A 00:27:33 [Speaker Changed] Hundred percent. And then when you see the ones that succeeded, sort of by definition the ones that succeeded, made it look easy, right? Because it’s like we’re on podcasts doing, doing all of these things. They 00:27:44 [Speaker Changed] Found the right niche, they pivoted appropriately. They built what was needed and the market rewarded 00:27:49 [Speaker Changed] That. That’s exactly right. How hard could it be? That’s exactly right. And and when I look at my history, I know how lucky I got. Like there’s so many forks in the road that, boy, if I had flipped heads instead of tails, I would not be here. And I had, I had to flip, you know, I had to flip tails 32 times in a row to get to, to where I am. 00:28:08 [Speaker Changed] I’m gonna, let me interrupt you a second ’cause I just have to share this. So I’ve done oh 550, 600 of these and I have heard that exact thing over and over again. And the first couple of times I heard it, especially from billionaires, I’m like, yeah, yeah, false humility. But then when I start hearing it from more people, from guys like you who are in the trenches chewing on glass, it’s like, and my own experience as an entrepreneur, you really smart and hard work is just table stakes. You really have to get lucky. And people don’t understand how the role of serendipity in, in how things work out. 00:28:46 [Speaker Changed] One, one of my favorite other quotes is Bo bo Durham, the comedians said, you know, don’t take advice from successful people. ’cause it’s, it’s like listening to Taylor Swift say, follow your dreams. You know, or, or the lottery winner goes, you know what you should do, sell everything you own and buy lottery tickets. That’s right. And 00:29:04 [Speaker Changed] That’s an XKCD. They told me I would never win, but I kept at it. That’s right. And here I am today. Exactly. No, it’s, it’s a hundred percent true. Listen, there’s so much more signal in the failures than there are in the successes. ’cause success. Maybe it was skill, maybe it was luck. We don’t know. 00:29:20 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. And I, what I try to coach like in my angel investments is it, I call it, you know, the love of the game. And so, you know, you see founders that I wanna be successful, I wanna be a successful founder. I wanna make the money. You know, and, and what I always tell ’em is like, hey, the, the problem with money doing this for the money is most of your journey, if not all, you’re poor, right? You’re seed stage, early stage, you’re just poor. And so if you’re doing it for the money, you, you kind of quickly lose motivation. ’cause you’re poor for years, right? And then let’s say you’re one of the lucky for you to get successful. Well, well now you’re rich. And so if you do it for the money now, now you just, you have no reason to do it anymore. ’cause you’ve got the money and the, the, the people that that, that are successful over time in this business, do it for the love of the game. Like I, you know, I do it because I love chewing glass. 00:30:09 [Speaker Changed] My, you know, my wife and I were having a conversation the other day about when we were poor and I mean really poor. And the really challenging thing is when you’re in the thick of it, you don’t know that it’s gonna work out. You have no idea, Hey, am I gonna get that lucky break? Is the right client, partner, customer gonna come along and and give me that critical mass to go to the next level? So not only are you poor, but the outcome is wholly unknown. And so if you don’t love it, then what are you, what are you doing? 00:30:42 [Speaker Changed] That’s right. You’re poor and you’re, it’s an you’re living in constant uncertainty. 00:30:46 [Speaker Changed] Uncertainty. Absolutely. 00:30:47 [Speaker Changed] And I think what people forget is, you know, I, I’m not poor anymore, but I still live in uncertainty and, you know, I don’t know what’s gonna happen. You know, I’m trying to build a bigger business, you know, and, and the water watermark keeps going up. And so like, if, if in three years the watermark isn’t higher, I I will feel like I failed the last three years. And I, I think that’s the, you know, that’s the essence of being entrepreneur is the watermark keeps going up and you keep going up. 00:31:11 [Speaker Changed] Huh. Really quite, quite fascinating. I want to dive into the world of, of private companies and alts, but before we do that, I just had to ask you a data question. My, my assumption is accessing reliable and clean data has to be the lifeblood of what you’re doing. How challenging is that? How many different inputs do you guys have to track at Carta? 00:31:37 [Speaker Changed] I have a perspective on, on software and data businesses that might be a bit provocative, which is, I’ll make this statement that software businesses cannot be data businesses. And the reason is, if a software business has customer data, they get that customer data by selling software and and service to this customer. And if they monetize that data on the other side, if their left hand is, we will keep, keep your data confidential and as part of our software service to you. But then with the right hand they’re selling that data, it cannibalizes their software business. ’cause the customers won’t trust them now ’cause they’re now giving ’em their data. Which is why Carta does not have a data product. We have tons of data. We do not have a monetizable data product. Huh, interesting. We only sell workflow or business operation software. The, the, it’s hard to think of a business that sells actual software and also sells data. I I can’t think of any, even Bloomberg started really as a data data business. The, the non-existent, non-existence of something is not proof that it cannot exist. But my my best example of why my theory that software businesses and data businesses cannot coexist in one company is Salesforce. If anybody would launch a data product, 00:32:55 [Speaker Changed] So funny. That’s who exactly it would be 00:32:56 [Speaker Changed] Salesforce was thinking of. And in 30 years they have not. And I don’t think they ever will. And I think the day Salesforce launches a successful data business, I I will be eating my words and I will be wrong, but I don’t think software businesses can become data businesses. I 00:33:11 [Speaker Changed] I would imagine that, so we use, in my shop, we use Salesforce as our CRM very customizable. And they have specific industries that they, they market towards and and customize. But the moment it feels like your data is being reused, every single one of their competitors would say, we keep your data safe. We don’t monetize the data. Give ’em up on them. Come to us where we respect privacy. I mean, I think the moment anybody tries that their competition is all over that. 00:33:43 [Speaker Changed] And, and you would agree because suddenly you’re now on every list of every vendor trying to sell software to bury and they know everything about you. ’cause Salesforce gave them your data. 00:33:52 [Speaker Changed] Not only that, but it’s not quite hipaa. But the SEC has privacy requirements. Things you’re not allowed to share when you, you’re supposed to know your client. You have all this data. And if one of your vendors is reusing that, repurposing that data for their own ends, like, wait, not only are you violating our privacy agreement, you’re putting me underwater with the SEC, they may come yell at me. I I don’t need that. Totally. I’m I’m gonna go to your competition. Kind of interesting. So, so let’s, let’s pivot towards the private markets. ’cause it’s so interesting. You’ve testified before Congress that’s startups and growth companies backed by private capital. That’s where most of the new job growth comes in the United States. Explain. 00:34:37 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. You know, public markets is, is actually a shrinking industry. You know, there’s fewer public companies today than there were 10 years ago by, by quite a big margin. But the number of private companies is growing astronomically and be, that’s largely fueled by there’s a lot more private capital than there used to be to fund these businesses. And there’s less reasons to, to, to go public now. So I think, I think that will continue to be true. I think it’s structurally true. When I go to the, to the hill and, and talk to our legislators, the, the common response is, well, we just have to push more companies to go public. I, I think it’s like what the, their, their belief is the public markets is a great product for everyday Americans to access growth equity. And I think they’re right. It, it is a good product for it. The problem is it’s not the, it’s a shrinking product and most of the growth is being hap is happening in the private markets. And there are attempts to get these companies to go public so that there can be retail access to them is isn’t working. It’s a little bit like, you know, the river’s coming and you’ve got like one tiny little dam trying to hold the water back. Let, 00:35:46 [Speaker Changed] Let me share a data point that I bet a lot of listeners are not familiar with the US is something like four to 5% of the global population where something like 24, 20 5% of the global economy, global market cap we’re over half. I mean, we are wildly disproportionate in our public markets. How much bigger does Congress wanna make that? I mean, what you’re describing makes a lot of sense. The public markets are enormous. Let’s let the private markets grow and see where they go. 00:36:16 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. And that’s certainly the, the, the message that that, that we’re pushing, we still have to solve the problem of, of retail access because as the number of public companies is, is shrinking. That’s less, less and less options for your everyday American to invest their money in their retirement. I don’t think the answer is to try to push more companies to go public. I think the answer is to create safe access for everyday Americans into private capital. And that’s what we spend a lot of time lobbying for in Congress. 00:36:45 [Speaker Changed] Huh. Really quite, quite fascinating coming up. We continue our conversation with Henry Ward, CEO and co-founder of Carter, talking about the rise of private company investing. I’m Barry Riol, you’re listening to Masters in Business on Bloomberg Radio. 00:37:16 I am Barry Reho. You are listening to Masters in Business on Bloomberg Radio. My extra special guest this week is Henry Ward. He’s the CEO and co-founder of Carta. They help manage the cap tables for tens of thousands of private companies, thousands of investment firms and millions of equity holders. They do a number of other things in terms of tracking, compensation, valuation, liquidity, all these really fascinating issues. So there are a number of companies that bring liquidity to private companies. Sometimes it’s it’s private equity or, or some form of a private fund. Other times it’s individuals who wanna participate in companies before they go public. What are your thoughts on the future of secondary liquidity, both for the investors and employees of startups and for the rest of the investing public that wants to participate in these privates? 00:38:13 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, so I am, I think I’m one of the maybe top five people in the world that have worked on private market liquidity. I, I spent the, the last 10 years working on the, on the problem. And I, I’m of the view now that that at least venture startup liquidity will, will never happen. And, and at least a, a secondary exchange in the, in the sense that we think of public market exchanges, the private markets are so different from public, it’s really kind of the upside down world. You know, in, in public markets, the the price is set by the last buyer, not the first in private markets. It’s set by the first and not the last. And public markets, it’s easier to sell one share than a hundred million dollars worth of shares in private markets. Easier to sell a hundred million dollar block than it is to sell one one share. You know, in public markets the distribution outcomes is mostly Gaussian normally distributed in private markets. It’s it’s power law. So all the math that exists to, in modern portfolio finance theory in public markets doesn’t work in private. So it, it is just, it’s a very different market infrastructure. I I think all the attempts they try to create liquidity in the, in the venture world are, are, will be failed attempts. But I hope I’m wrong, I hope I’m just old. I 00:39:27 [Speaker Changed] Mean, equity Zen seems to have figured this out a while ago. They seem to have put together a way to do secondaries for creating some liquidity for, for insiders or employees at companies. But it’s not like they’re a trillion dollar platform. It’s, it’s a little bit of a niche specific focused. And there are other companies like that. I just happen to be thinking of them recently. But really what you’re saying is there’s a gulf between trillions and trillions of dollars in public equity and private stock and, and never the twain shall meet. So 00:40:05 [Speaker Changed] In, in public markets liquidity begets liquidity. And so it centralizes on two exchanges in the US and most regions it centralizes on one in, in private markets. What’s happened is there’s equities and there’s many others. There’s many, many small niche businesses doing secondaries. It does happen, but liquidity does not. But beget liquidity, the, as soon as one of these companies starts to scale, all the competitors come around and they devolve back down to a niche business. And and that’s just the, the, the market structure is that any company that actually starts to scale in their private markets, it actually the it degenerates there. The, we’ve seen so many examples of com of private market liquidity providers, you know, come in hot, get really a quick start and then, and then once they hit scale it falls down. And so you see so many of these small businesses that will always stay small businesses. I don’t think there’s an opportunity for someone to consolidate the market. 00:41:03 [Speaker Changed] There’s been so much focus on privates and alternatives. D does this intensity of interest, does this surprise you at all or you’ve been up to your chin in this for, for a decade and what took everybody so long? 00:41:17 [Speaker Changed] We, we’ve been in this up to up to up to my chin as you say, for for a decade plus. So it’s, it’s not surprising. What I think is really, we’re in a moment of time in the speed that it’s happening, especially with the current administration. We’re liberalizing a lot of the rules for private market access. You know, there’s a lot of work being done around can retail investors access private equity firms? Private credit firms. I think that will continue to happen and I think that’s a big tailwind for, for Carta. And I think the, the, the US economy and and GDP because so much of this capital is being now deployed in, in useful ways. I think that will continue to be true in the next administration. Hopefully they will continue that legislative policy. I think it will, it will be weird in 20 or 30 years, it will be weird that we locked out 99% of Americans out of private capital. 00:42:14 [Speaker Changed] So when I look at who’s being aggressive in terms of moving from, how do we get more people onto the alternatives and private side, it’s everyone from Blackstone to BlackRock, Carlisle, Apollo, Goldman Sachs go down the list. I’m assuming you’re working with some or most of these companies. 00:42:33 [Speaker Changed] We we know them all and we’re we’re huge fans. I I was lucky enough to spend an hour with Rob Goldstein, the, the COO over at BlackRock and, and he was telling me kind of the vision of, of BlackRock and their, their perspective on private markets and you know, he, he made this very salient point, which was, you know, when they talk to their customers, they, they might look at a customer and they, they spend, you know, $25 million a year on public market infrastructure and technology for their public market asset allocation software. And they might spend, you know, 300, you know, $350,000 on their private market stuff. A fraction, a fraction, right? With BlackRock. But they might spend a million dollars total. So 350 k is with BlackRock and 700 K is with a bunch of other vendors. And his team is like, oh, we should go after that 700 k and we’ll win the whole, you know, million dollars that they send in alts. And he goes, no, no, no, no. What we need to do is figure out how to get that million dollars a year they spend in alts to be $25 million a year. Right. And then we’ll capture half of that. And, and that was the, the mental mind shift that I think BlackRock is so smart at, which is we’re trying to grow the market, not not our percentage of the market. Right. 00:43:50 [Speaker Changed] That makes, that makes a whole lot of sense. So they’re looking at an adjacent market to their public market dominance. They’re the biggest investment firm in the world at around $12 trillion. How do you decide what adjacent markets are attractive? And you might wanna enter them if you started with cap tables, you’re doing all sorts of other data analytics. How do you figure out what’s adjacent? 00:44:15 [Speaker Changed] We, we have a really strict framework on it because we spend a lot of our time thinking about where we can expand. And we have really two, two criteria. So one is do we have a a right to win? So what gives us competitive edge that we can do that nobody else can do? And second is, can we, can we win that market quickly? Because we’re very much a software business. Like if, if you can win a market, but it takes a long time. We’re a growth growth company, so it’s gotta be fast. So you have to have a very aggressive customer acquisition model that, that creates a flywheel. That the more customers you get, the more customers you get. And so if those two things are true, we’ll we’ll go after it. And it it, it leads you to really funny things where you wouldn’t actually attack adjacent markets that are obvious adja that have obvious adjacencies. So the example I love is cap tables and four nine A cap tables was a legal service when we entered it done by lawyers. Four nine a valuations was a valuation service done by valuation providers. Nobody thought of them as similar. What we realized is by having the cap table, we could do valuations faster, cheaper, smarter. And so we just started doing valuations. Well, 00:45:21 [Speaker Changed] Well, you know, the tomba number of shareholders, you know what the last transaction or funding was. It sounds pretty basic math, right? 00:45:27 [Speaker Changed] Totally. It’s just math on the cap table. But they’re a completely different industry. So if you think about from a market perspective, they’re different. But you think about it from where we have competitive edge, they’re the same and the same with fund accounting, fund administration, fund accounting software. Very different industry than cap table management. But we’re able to connect the cap tables to the funds and that gave us unique competitive advantage that nobody else could do. And so now we’re in the fund admin business and that’s, that’s our our second biggest business line. 00:45:54 [Speaker Changed] You, you guys also do compensation analytics. How did you find your way into that space? 00:45:58 [Speaker Changed] We realized we’re the only ones that could do benchmarking for both salary and equity for startups. Oh, of course. Nobody else can do it. And so Right. 00:46:06 [Speaker Changed] Without the equity, the salary may not be that significant. 00:46:09 [Speaker Changed] That’s right. But to, to have start at a priority and go, we’re gonna do cap tables and that’s gonna lead us into compensation didn’t make a ton of sense. And that’s the, we have a a a a flywheel of this is how we entered these industries. 00:46:21 [Speaker Changed] You are the perfect person to ask this question. I’m gonna go off script. So I spoke at an event in June in Silicon Valley. It was a kind of funky hotel that was turned into this really interesting space right on the edge of trying to remember exactly where it was about 45 minutes outside of San Francisco. But anyway, it was an employee benefits conference with all sorts of people. And I was there to talk about my book at the time. And I heard over and over again from all these people who, the 401k people, they’re employee compensation consultants, they’re health benefit consultants, all these people who were telling me that there’s this sort of misalignment amongst Silicon Valley employees who were more interested in the dollars than they are in the equity. Which just completely sounds upside down to me. Am I just looking at a weird corner of the world or is that a thing that, hey, you can’t pay your rent with equity. I have to at least make x What do you see out there in terms of how startup employees are thinking about equity versus cash payments for comp? Yeah, 00:47:40 [Speaker Changed] We, we’ve spent a lot of time thinking about this and I’ll, I’ll I’ll frame it. As you know, wealth management financial advice is a well established industry in the public world and the, I’ll call it the liquid world, right? You pay, you know, 1% or half a percent of a UM to your financial advisor and they, they help you manage your assets. There is no equivalent in the private world. Like if I’m a employee and I make, you know, $150,000 a year in cash, but I’m sitting on a million or $2 million of equity, illiquid equity, how, how do I think about that? How, how do I work on it? And there is no industry for that. The financial advisors don’t know how to work with that in part ’cause they don’t understand the, the private market, you know, illiquid asset piece. But also they don’t have, they don’t have any way to monetize $2 million worth of private stock. 00:48:29 You can’t, you know, you can’t charge one basis point or a percent of a UM on it. And so, so we’ve wrestled with this question of if an industry were to be created, not wealth managed but but wealth management for illiquid people for high net worth, but illiquid asset holders, what would that industry look like? And so we’ve been thinking a lot about that problem. And, and we, we recently launched a partnership with Morgan Stanley where we’re last year we posed this problem to them and we said, Hey, we think it’s worth solving wealth management for illiquid holders. How would we do that? And they’re, you know, the largest wealth management firm in the country. They do this extremely well. And now we’re creating a motion to basically help these employees who are like, I would just want the cash ’cause I don’t know what to do with this equity. I don’t know, I don’t understand it. I I don’t know when it’s gonna be liquid. And can you create a financial advisory industry to help those people? 00:49:26 [Speaker Changed] Hmm. That, that’s really fascinating. I was genuinely shocked. Maybe because I’m, I’m more risk seeking than risk averse and the thought of equity is so, you know, attractive to me. But I guess when you’re in the thick of it and you’re grinding a hundred hour weeks, hey, I’m working my butt off and I still have to worry about paying my rent. I I don’t wanna go that way. That was the only explanation I could come up with. But it was, it was really quite fascinating. I only have you for a limited amount of time. Why don’t we jump to some of our favorite questions that we ask all of our guests starting with, and you’re a good person to ask this. Tell us about your mentors who helped shape your career. 00:50:08 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, I, I don’t think I’ve had just one. I I think I pulled together a lot of people that have that helped me with little different things. And so, you know, everything from my boxing coach in high school and college that, that, you know, boxing’s an interesting sport ’cause it’s one of the very few sports that if you’re tired and you’re in pain and you have to let off the gas a little bit, it hurts more, not less. And 00:50:33 [Speaker Changed] You gotta dig 00:50:33 [Speaker Changed] Deep. That’s right. And you know, there’s, it’s literally in the corner and you know, from, from perseverance from him, from the marines, from, you know, mark Andreessen who helped me figure out, you know, NetSuite, what we call ERP for private capital at a breakfast to, you know, John Waldron, who I had to got to have a lunch with him, who’s the president at, at Goldman, who explained to me why bankers make more money than I do. And it’s ’cause of the regulatory defensibility. And so you just pick up these nuggets from these very smart people and, and you, you hold ’em as a treasure trove. 00:51:11 [Speaker Changed] Let’s talk about books. What are some of your favorites? Are you reading anything currently? 00:51:15 [Speaker Changed] We just read Amp It Up as a, as a leadership team. So we, last month we, we took 60 of our top leaders at Carta and, and on an offsite. And every time we do an offsite at Carta, we pick a book to read and everybody has to read it. And we do a discussion group. And it was very timely for us. We’re, we’re in very much an acceleration mo motion and so, so everybody at, at Carta right now is, is reading Amp It up and, and talking about it. 00:51:41 [Speaker Changed] Hmm. Really interesting. What about streaming? What are you listening to in terms of podcasts or watching on Netflix or Amazon? I kind of get the sense you’re not a big couch potato kind of guy. 00:51:51 [Speaker Changed] I’m not, I I don’t really watch TV except I have an 11-year-old boy and I recently got him into Arrested Development, which is a classic, classic. I absolutely mean it’s some of the best comedy ever done. And, and we’re watching it together and we’re loving it. And now he, he hits me with the lines and you know, dad, I, I’ve made a huge mistake and we’re having a great time with it 00:52:14 [Speaker Changed] Narrator. It wasn’t, yeah, right. That’s, I mean, that’s where that comes from. People use it all the time, but it all goes right back to, I, I like his podcast, smartless is always kind of fun. Our final two questions. What sort of advice would you give to a recent college grad who is interested in a career in fill in the blank entrepreneurship, startups, private companies? 00:52:41 [Speaker Changed] You know, I, I just did a talk at Waterloo yesterday to a bunch of soon to be grads there and, and I, I said, you know, they were computer science grads and, and I said, you know, there’s, you know, they know of this algorithm called the Hill climbing algorithm, which is basically, if you’re trying to find a global maximum versus a local maximum. What I mean by that, the analogy I use is, let’s say you’re an a French, you know, you’re climbing in the French Alps as a mountain climber and you’re trying to find the tallest mountain in the French Alps, but there’s cloud cover. You can’t see, you can’t see the tops of these. How would you find the, the highest mountain? And you would, you would do it by picking a mountain, climbing to the top, recording how high you are, and then randomly jumping to another mountain and climbing and recording that. 00:53:22 And there’s all this math around, you know, how many random jumps to mountains do. You have to have to have a 90% probability of finding the global, the global maximum. And I, I say it’s a great analogy for a metaphor for, for early careers, which is most of us unfortunately are taught. You go through kindergarten to high school to college, you pick a career at 19 or a specialty, you then become a, a finance analyst, an associate, then you become a senior associate, then you become a man and you just, you kind of walk this track and you, you never ask the question, am I on a local opt hill or a global optimal hill? And I encourage people early to, to jump mountains to figure out which, which mountain they want to be on. And I think one of the reasons many people my age are very unhappy in their careers is they look back and they realize, oh, I got to the top of the mountain, but it was the wrong mountain. And I encourage young people to, to mountain jump. 00:54:17 [Speaker Changed] I, I, I love that metaphor. Mountain jump is a great, great line. What do you know about the world of entrepreneurship, startups, et cetera today might have been useful 20 or so years ago when you were first starting out? 00:54:31 [Speaker Changed] Idea matters. It matters a lot. ’cause I’ve had a lot of great ideas that did not work and I worked hard, hard at it. I also think there’s this counterintuitive, I guess, thesis that’s happening right now, which is the more entrepreneurs there are, the harder entrepreneurship gets. But people think the opposite, right? Oh, so many’s do, so many people are doing it. I can do too. The number Michael 00:54:58 [Speaker Changed] MOBAs not calls that the paradox of skill, the more skillful players there are in sports, the more luck matters because everybody’s playing at such a high level. 00:55:08 [Speaker Changed] A hundred percent. And I think it’s one of these funny things where like, not many people, you know, dream or move to Atlanta to be a hundred meter, you know, sprinter. ’cause I, you know, I think I can be the greatest a hundred meter sprinter in the world. And it’s because there’s not a lot of luck. I mean, there’s luck around, you don’t get injured and all of those things, but like, we pretty quickly can tell who’s good and who’s not good. That’s 00:55:32 [Speaker Changed] Your skill outcome. 00:55:33 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. And, and the, it’s a little bit like acting like so much of it is luck that because so much of it is luck. People think anybody can do it and it, it’s actually worse. You actually have to be a super skilled, you know, a hundred meter sprinter and you have to be lucky to do one of these startups. And I think a lot of people are like, oh, you know, a lot of it’s luck. So if it’s luck, anybody can do it. It’s, it’s, you gotta have both. It makes it actually harder, not easier. 00:55:59 [Speaker Changed] I love the expression, table stakes. Smart, hardworking, that’s just to enter the arena. Then you gotta luck. Get lucky on top of it. That’s right. Un unbelievable. Henry, this has been absolutely fascinating. We have been speaking with Henry Ward.

Check out our Live Update Coverage on the Best Meme Coins for October 21, 2025! Meme coins are the centerpiece of today’s crypto boom, surfing the bullish waves like none other. Backed by unwavering support from asset managers like JPMorgan and exchanges, the momentum is rising constantly. With a marketing cap over $55B, meme coins have Lamborghini potential (think 7-10x in a day). High-risk, high-reward players naturally love them, and so should you. Top Choices of Best Meme Coins That Could Soar Next Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) - Real-Time Layer-2 Solution for Scaling Bitcoin Launch: May, 2025 VISIT NOW Maxi Doge ($MAXI) - High-Impact Meme Coin Built On Strength, Staking & Conviction Launch: July, 2025 VISIT NOW PepeNode ($PEPENODE) - A New, Gamified Way to Mine to Earn Meme Coin Rewards Launch: February, 2025 VISIT NOW Snorter Token ($SNORT) - Lowest-Fee Telegram Trading Bot for Solana and Ethereum Launch: May, 2025 VISIT NOW This page gives you the inside edge—live updates on trending meme coins, alpha from crypto degens, and whispers from FOMO-driven trading circles.

This page gives you the inside edge—live updates on trending meme coins, alpha from crypto degens, and whispers from FOMO-driven trading circles. If you’re hunting for the next 10x or 100x gem, you’re in the right place. We update this page frequently throughout the day, as we get the latest insider insights on the best meme coins, so keep refreshing! October 21, 2025 • 15:00 UTC Bitcoin’s resilience, following the October 10 market crash, which wiped out $19B in leveraged positions and more than $450B in market cap, hints at a coming bull run. According to analysts at TD Cowen, Bitcoin could reach $141K by December if the asset regains its lost momentum. Following the brutal market crash, Bitcoin lost 10% in a matter of hours and dipped below $105K over the course of a week. A $141K prediction is more than feasible given Bitcoin’s resilience to such a devastating hit, and thanks to Bitcoin Hyper’s ($HYPER) presale, currently at $24.4M. As Bitcoin’s Layer 2 Solution, Hyper aims to enhance the Bitcoin network by making it faster, cheaper, more performant, and more scalable, thereby accommodating institutional investors who require high throughput and near-instant finality. Learn how to buy $HYPER right here. October 21, 2025 • 14:00 UTC Global investment management firm VanEck recently filed an application with the SEC for an ETF that tracks the price of Lido Staked $ETH ($stETH). If approved, it would be the first of its kind in the US. The firm also stated in a blog post that its ETF would give institutional investors ‘a compliant, tax-efficient way to gain Ethereum staking exposure within a regulated investment structure.’ While ETFs, such as those proposed by VanEck, offer investors a way to profit from crypto without owning the asset directly, others prefer to hold their investment directly. These investors, however, understand the challenge of finding promising assets to buy, especially if they’re in the market for the best meme coins. This is where Snorter Token ($SNORT) comes in with its proposed Snorter Bot. When launched, it’ll be a Telegram-based crypto trading bot that facilitates features such as sniping, copying trades, and managing wallets. Find out more about Snorter Token here. October 21, 2025 • 13:00 UTC Tom Lee’s BitMine Immersion continued with its Ethereum ($ETH) buying spree as the second-largest crypto’s price slid over the past few days. The world’s top Ethereum corporate treasury bought an additional 203,826 $ETH yesterday, which brought its total holdings to 3,236,014 $ETH. Lee said in a statement yesterday that with the expected Ethereum Supercycle, the currently low price of the coin represents an attractive risk/reward.’ Like Lee, other crypto traders are looking for alternative digital assets that are promising yet reasonably priced, such as Maxi Doge ($MAXI). The project aims to position $MAXI as one of the market’s best meme coins and dethrone its distant cousin Doge. To date, the $MAXI presale has raised over $3.7M, as it continues to attract fellow degens to the fold. Get the full details in ‘What is Maxi Doge?’ October 21, 2025 • 12:00 UTC Strategy (MSTR), the largest corporate to hold Bitcoin, recently purchased 168 $BTC at an average price of $112,051, according to a filing on Monday. The recent purchase brings up strategy’s total $BTC holdings to 640,418 (worth $71B), with an overall average purchase price of $74,010. $BTC prices have been on a rollercoaster since the market crash on October 10th. The OG crypto rebounded to $111K on Monday after falling to as low as $103,500, helping MSTR shares climb by 3% in pre-market trading, just below $300 per share. While institutional giants like Strategy continue to expand their $BTC reserves, retail investors remain cautious amid market volatility, redirecting capital toward promising presale opportunities with strong upside potential. One such rising contender is Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) — a Layer-2 scalability solution that employs Solana Virtual Machine to bring lightning-fast transactions and cross-chain operability to Bitcoin’s Layer 1. Check out our expert $HYPER price prediction here. October 21, 2025 • 10:47 UTC Binance founder Changpeng Zhao believes that the crypto captain has what it takes to flip gold’s market cap, although it might take some time. Currently, gold is the world’s largest asset, but that is likely to change soon, as the $BTC price soars over the coming cycles. Currently ranked eighth, $BTC has a market cap of $2.2T. CZ’s post also serves as a reminder that the long-term crypto projection looks strong, despite brief corrections. This is further evident from Bitcoin Hyper’s sizzling hot presale, ready to smash through $25M. The project is building a layer-2 solution for Bitcoin, bringing more speed and programmability to the network. Could $HYPER be the next meme coin to explode? Read our Bitcoin Hyper price prediction to find out. October 21, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Elon Musk reignites meme coin manis with his new viral post ‘Flōki is back on the job as 𝕏 CEO!’ His post sent $FLOKI soaring over 20% within hours, causing the token to climb from $0.00006689 to $0.00007456. $FLOKI’s derivatives volume spiked by 663% and open interest rose by 165%, all indicating strong retail speculation surrounding the asset. $FLOKI did not soar alone; Musk’s post helped the entire meme coin market cap to rise by 5.8% to $55.2B, once again highlighting his unmatched influence on dog-themed tokens. FLOKI’s official X account declared it the ‘#1 trending token on CxoinGecko,’ branding itself as ‘Elon’s dog.’ With $FLOKI riding Musk’s viral wave, the newest contender in the block is quietly stealing the spotlight – Maxi Doge ($MAXI). A meme token built on a body-building trading doge that represents gym pumps, raw strength, and the grind of the bull market. Beyond the high-octane meme appeal, the project is already building a loyal community united by its bold ‘crush the charts’ motto. Check out our in-depth $MAXI price prediction here. October 21, 2025 • 10:00 UTC BlackRock just launched its iShares Bitcoin ETP (IB1T) on the London Stock Exchange with the starting price of $11.10. As the official press release states, the goal is to expose ‘retail investors (i) with specific knowledge and/or experience of investing in similar products’ to Bitcoin and other digital assets in a regulated ecosystem. BlackRock’s IB1T is now available in 12 registered locations, including Austria, Spain, Portugal, UK, and Germany. The news is bullish for Bitcoin and could catalyze its Q4 run once $BTC breaks the $120K resistance point again. When that happens, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) may also see visible boost, although the presale is already in full bull mode. As Bitcoin’s Layer 2, promising a faster, cheaper, and more scalable Bitcoin ecosystem, Bitcoin Hyper already raised $24.4M in presale and it targets a Q1 2026 release date if the market is favorable.
