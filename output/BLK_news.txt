Securitize, a pioneering platform in asset tokenization, has announced its intention to go public through a merger with Cantor Equity Partners II, valuing the company at $1.25 billion. The platform disclosed the strategic move on October 28, 2025, with this set to mark a major development for the tokenization industry. Securitize is at the forefront of bringing global financial institutions onchain. The move sees it join a growing number of crypto-focused companies going public across Wall Street and elsewhere. In its case, the platform, renowned for its role in tokenizing assets for entities such as BlackRock and Apollo, will merge with Cantor Equity Partners II as it eyes the $1.25 billion listing. Cantor Equity Partners is a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) sponsored by Cantor Fitzgerald. The transaction is anticipated to generate up to $469 million in gross proceeds, including a $225 million private investment in public equity (PIPE) financing round. This capital infusion will enhance Securitize’s ability to scale its operations and advance its mission of making capital markets more accessible and efficient through tokenization. 8/ The deal is expected to deliver $469M of gross proceeds consisting of an upsized $225 million in committed common stock PIPE, anchored by new and existing blue-chip institutional investors, and $244 million of cash held in CEPT’s trust account, assuming no redemptions. — Securitize (@Securitize) October 28, 2025 The merged entity, to be renamed Securitize Corp., will list on Nasdaq under the ticker symbol “SECZ.” Going public sees Securitize cement its position as a leader in the tokenization space. The platform, which has facilitated over $4 billion in tokenized assets, could attract even more attention as a public entity. The company’s platform offers a comprehensive ecosystem, integrating with major blockchains and financial institutions. It stands out as the first vertically integrated, SEC-registered tokenization provider. BlackRock and Apollo are among firms to tokenize funds with Securitize. “This is a defining moment for Securitize and for the future of finance,” said Carlos Domingo, co-founder and chief executive officer of Securitize. “We founded this company with a mission to democratize capital markets by making them more accessible, transparent, and efficient through tokenization. This is the next chapter in making financial markets operate at the speed of the internet and is another step in our mission to bring the next generation of finance onchain and tokenize the world.” The public listing of Securitize is expected to accelerate the adoption of tokenization across traditional financial markets. Cantor Fitzgerald CEO Brandon Lutnick noted: “We believe that blockchain technology has massive potential to transform finance, and partnering with Securitize underscores our confidence in tokenization as a foundational force in the next era of capital markets.” The real-world asset (RWA) tokenization market has expanded by 135% over the past year, reaching a total value of $35 billion, according to recent data. Analysts at Citi project that the tokenized RWA sector could climb to nearly $4 trillion by 2030.

Vanguard Group has turned artificial intelligence from a pilot program into a profit engine, generating more than $500 million in measurable business value across customer service, analytics and software development, according to MIT Sloan Management Review. The $11 trillion asset manager’s methodical rollout shows how large financial institutions can use AI to boost productivity while maintaining trust, governance and employee engagement.

Δ As mentioned in MIT Sloan analysis on Monday (Oct. 27), Vanguard’s first wave of AI deployments focused on service and productivity. Its “Crew Assist” tool, powered by Azure OpenAI, helps call-center representatives handle investor inquiries more efficiently, while an automated report generator produces customized market summaries for more than 150,000 advisers. Both tools have reduced call-handling times and improved customer satisfaction. The firm’s “Digital Advisor” applies machine learning to model job-loss risk and unemployment duration, tailoring financial-planning recommendations even for clients with minimal balances. A separate call-summarization model automatically drafts meeting notes and follow-ups, reducing administrative work by nearly 50 percent. Vanguard’s research arm has also trained a large-language model on 22,000 corporate earnings-call transcripts to forecast dividend cuts. Companies flagged as negative were five times more likely to announce reductions within a month, underscoring how generative models can supplement traditional financial analysis. As reported by MIT Sloan, Chief Information Officer Nitin Tandon said AI is “embedded where it makes the most difference in decisions that improve investor outcomes and streamline how our teams deliver value.” While Vanguard has taken a focused, high-ROI approach, JPMorgan Chase is expanding AI across the enterprise. Its “LLM Suite” supports more than 200,000 employees and includes 175 active AI applications, from automated research assistants to wealth-management tools that helped boost sales. And JPMorgan isn’t the only company to tap into AI-powered tools for insights into wealth management. BlackRock has also integrated generative AI capabilities into Aladdin, its portfolio management platform used by global institutions, providing portfolio managers with faster insights into exposures and scenario analysis. Advertisement: Scroll to Continue Half of Vanguard’s 20,000 employees have completed its internal AI Academy training program, designed to improve literacy and responsible use. Each system is monitored for drift, bias and performance under the company’s governance framework. Chief Data Analytics Officer Ryan Swann told MIT Sloan Review that Vanguard’s success sees “the best outcomes when humans and machines collaborate, not compete.” That approach mirrors findings from the World Economic Forum’s AI in Financial Services report, which found that 70 percent of financial executives expect AI to drive revenue growth but warned that scaling safely depends on workforce readiness and governance discipline. Citigroup is also emphasizing human-AI collaboration through its “agentic AI” system, Stylus Workspaces, which allows employees to perform multi-step workflows, such as market analysis and report summarization, with a single prompt. The tool connects directly to Citi’s internal databases and collaboration platforms, turning AI into an end-to-end task manager. The rollout began in September and is expected to expand globally next year. Across the industry, finance leaders are shifting from cost-based AI metrics to performance-based ones. A PYMNTS report found that CFOs increasingly view AI as a driver of growth and revenue rather than just operational savings, a change reflected in how firms like Vanguard and Citi quantify ROI in business terms rather than experimentation.

Time Published: 2025-10-28T18:03:37Z

© 2025 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy Burlington Stores, the retailer formerly known as Burlington Coat Factory, has taken 42,575 square feet for a store at the as-yet-unbuilt 72-22 Broadway in the Jackson Heights section of Queens. Adam Heller, Stephen Weber and Joshua Singer from the Heller Organization represented the landlord, Werber Real Estate. Clifford Simon, David Rosen and Jake Simon from CNS Real Estate repped the tenant. The length of the lease and the asking rent were unavailable, though CNS classified the lease as “long-term.” Retail asking rents in Jackson Heights for this quarter equaled around $64.10 per square foot, according to CoStar. Burlington’s new Jackson Heights store is scheduled to open in September 2028. 72-22 Broadway is set to be a 13-story, mixed-use building with 60,000 square feet of retail on three levels, with two floors dedicated to office and the rest multifamily residential, Clifford Simon told CO. “Burlington’s arrival is a strong addition to the Jackson Heights community, bringing much-needed affordable soft goods to one of the city’s busiest transit hubs,” Heller said in an email to CO. “We’re excited about the continued momentum in the area as this corridor continues to thrive as a key shopping destination in Queens.” Traded was first to note the lease, which was signed in August. Burlington has been busy on several fronts after opening 101 new stores in 2024 and aiming for around the same number this year. The company took over 45 leases from Joann in May 2025, including at 535 Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, following Joann’s second bankruptcy filing in January 2025. The month before, Burlington paid over $257 million to BlackRock to acquire an 889,445-square-foot industrial warehouse in Southern California where the company had been the sole tenant since 2019, as CO previously reported. Burlington also signed a 12-year, 77,970-square-foot lease at RXR and Hudson Bay Capital’s 620 Avenue of the Americas in December 2024 in a move from 695 Avenue of the Americas, as CO previously reported. The company took over the spot of the former Bed, Bath & Beyond outlet. Werber Real Estate, as Roosevelt 72 LLC, purchased the Jackson Heights site — also using the address 72-11 Roosevelt Avenue, according to public records — from Delco Properties for $24 million in May 2020. Representatives for Burlington Stores, Werber Real Estate and the Heller Organization did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

"Owning crypto assets or gold are assets of fear," Fink said during his appearance at the Future Investment Initiative conference in Riyadh, according to a Bloomberg report. "You own these assets because you're frightened of the debasement of your assets. You're worried about your financial security. You're worried about your physical security." “The renewed focus on the so‑called ‘debasement trade’—where investors move away from fiat currencies into hard assets—is rooted in a clear trend: purchasing power is weakening in light of both fiscal and monetary policy leeway, especially on the U.S. dollar side,” Fabian Dori, Chief Investment Officer at Sygnum Bank, told Decrypt. “There are good reasons why private investors, banks, and institutions may start to hedge using Bitcoin,” he added, while warning that 24/7 volatility demands new risk systems and round-the-clock liquidity management. The concerns come as the U.S. government's debt burden is projected to exceed levels in both Italy and Greece for the first time this century. General government gross debt in the U.S. will surge by more than 20 percentage points to reach 143.4% of GDP by 2030, surpassing pandemic-era records, according to IMF forecasts. The IMF estimates the U.S. budget deficit will remain above 7% of GDP annually until 2030, the highest among rich nations tracked by the fund. Fink has gone from calling cryptos such as Bitcoin “the domain of money launderers and thieves” in 2017 to describing himself as a “major believer” in 2024, saying it’s “an instrument you invest in when you’re more frightened.” Two weeks ago, he told CBS that markets force constant reassessment, adding that crypto has "a role in the same way there is a role for gold, that is, it's an alternative." With BlackRock managing $12.5 trillion in assets and operating the largest crypto ETF, the iShares Bitcoin Trust, with $93.9 billion under management, his views carry substantial weight across global markets. Nic Puckrin, crypto analyst and co-founder of The Coin Bureau, told Decrypt that while Bitcoin originated as an "asset of fear" in response to the 2008 financial crisis, crypto has evolved into "a risk-on bet on the future of blockchain technology and an entirely new, borderless financial system." Bitcoin and blue-chip tokens remain viewed as hedges against fiat devaluation, Puckrin said, calling it "a secular trend, not just a short-term fear-based strategy." Bitcoin is currently trading at around $114,820, down 0.4% in the past 24 hours, per CoinGecko data. Meanwhile, users of prediction market Myriad, launched by Decrypt’s parent company Dastan, expect that Bitcoin will not outperform gold this year, suggesting lingering uncertainty about crypto's volatility despite growing institutional adoption. Sygnum’s Dori pointed to U.S. public entities exploring strategic reserves, major managers positioning Bitcoin as collateral, and the CME’s move toward 24/7 crypto derivatives as signs that the “pieces of the puzzle are coming together.” Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2025 Decrypt Media, Inc.

Title: US spot Bitcoin ETF balances are negative without BlackRock

Without BlackRock's IBIT, Bitcoin ETFs face potential outflows, showcasing a fragile market balance. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Over the past year, Bitcoin’s exchange-traded fund (ETF) boom has been celebrated as proof that Wall Street has finally embraced crypto. Yet the numbers reveal something far more fragile. On Oct. 28, Vetle Lunde, head of research at K33 Research, noted that US-traded Bitcoin ETFs have attracted about $26.9 billion in inflows year-to-date. However, that headline figure hides a stark imbalance that BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) alone accounts for roughly $28.1 billion of those flows. In other words, Bitcoin ETFs would be in net outflows this year without IBIT. The product’s relentless accumulation has single-handedly offset redemptions across competitors, keeping aggregate inflows positive and sustaining Bitcoin’s narrative of institutional adoption. Since launching in early 2024, IBIT has dominated every major performance metric in the ETF ecosystem. According to SoSo Value data, it has seen about $65.3 billion in lifetime inflows, compared to $21.3 billion across all other Bitcoin funds combined. Meanwhile, Grayscale’s GBTC has suffered roughly $24.6 billion in redemptions, confirming that without IBIT, the aggregate picture would be deeply negative. This effectively means that BlackRock’s IBIT scale stands in a league of its own. The fund drew $37 billion in its debut year and has added another $28 billion so far in 2025, pushing its total assets under management past $90 billion, which is well ahead of any competitor. According to Coinperps data, Bitcoin ETFs collectively hold about 1.3 million BTC, and IBIT accounts for over 60% of that entire stash. A significant part of IBIT’s growth can be linked to the fact that BlackRock has used its $12.5 trillion AUM, retail brokerage channels, and institutional relationships to channel demand into a single flagship product. The asset manager’s entry into the emerging industry instantly conferred legitimacy on a sector still reeling from the broader crisis of trust. Eric Balchunas, Bloomberg ETF Analyst, said: “When BlackRock filed for IBIT, the price was $30,000 and the stench of FTX was still in air. It’s now [over] $110k (a return that is 7x that of the mighty S&P 500) and is now seen as legitimate for other big investors.” Apart from that, the fund’s recent success can also be linked to how Bitcoin has transformed BlackRock’s investor base. Last year, the firm revealed that three out of four IBIT investors were entirely new to BlackRock’s iShare product suite. This shows that IBIT has become not just a crypto ETF but also a client-acquisition engine for the world’s largest asset manager. Indeed, the asset manager’s custom creation mechanisms have become increasingly popular among large Bitcoin holders, or “whales,” who were once wary of traditional financial institutions. These mechanisms allow investors to transfer their Bitcoin directly to the ETF in exchange for new shares, bypassing the need to sell on the open market. So far, the firm has reportedly processed over $3 billion in such in-kind transfers, reflecting the strong confidence in its custodial design and long-term exposure model. This strong dominance has created a halo effect that has proven very profitable for BlackRock. Barely more than a year old, IBIT already ranks as BlackRock’s top ten revenue generators, surpassing long-standing funds like the iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF. IBIT’s overarching dominance of the Bitcoin ETF space begs the question of what will happen when its numbers eventually slow down. If IBIT’s inflows taper, the immediate impact would be felt across market liquidity and price stability. At its current size, even a modest reduction in buying could remove a significant source of consistent demand. That demand has acted as a quasi-monetary inflow, offsetting miner sell pressure and exchange outflows. A slowdown would therefore widen spreads on US spot exchanges, reduce arbitrage opportunities for market makers, and weaken the feedback loop that has kept Bitcoin’s price anchored above key support levels. In essence, the ETF bid has become Bitcoin’s floor, and IBIT is most of that bid. The knock-on effects would also ripple through institutional sentiment. If month-over-month flows turn negative, family offices and RIA desks benchmarking performance to IBIT could rebalance away from Bitcoin ETFs entirely. That withdrawal would lower the “liquidity premium” currently embedded in Bitcoin’s price. Finally, a sustained stagnation in IBIT inflows could shift capital toward Ethereum and newly launched altcoins ETFs, eroding Bitcoin’s dominance ratio. However, Lunde pointed out that BlackRock’s absence from these product suites could limit their overall net flows. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

The company’s common stock will trade on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol “SECZ” once the transaction is completed, Securitize said. The firm will also issue digital representations of its stock on a blockchain, the company added. Securitize expects up to $469 million in proceeds from the proposed merger, which would stem from a private placement in public equity and Cantor Equity Partners II’s trust account. Existing backers, including BlackRock–the world’s largest asset manager–and financial services giants ARK Invest, and Morgan Stanley Investment Management, will see their equity rolled into the combined company, Securitize said. The stock price of Cantor Equity Partners II, an affiliate of the firm linked to U.S. Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, fell 7% on Tuesday to $11.93, according to Yahoo Finance. Securitize offers a platform enabling companies to manage issuance of real-world assets on-chain, including stock and money market funds. Last March, the company helped BlackRock debut its $2.8 billion USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL). Several crypto firms have debuted on Wall Street this year as U.S. regulators and lawmakers have moved to bring clarity to the industry. Securitize CEO Carlos Domingo told Decrypt that Circle’s blockbuster IPO in June provided ample motivation. “We started thinking, maybe this makes sense for us,” he said. “We’ve been really pushing for the company to become profitable, and I think there are a lot of opportunities.” Domingo described BlackRock’s BUIDL as a “catalyst” for tokenization, and last month, Securitize reached an agreement with FG Nexus, a Nasdaq-listed Ethereum treasury firm, to issue a tokenized version of its stock on Ethereum. Securitize’s tokenization platform underpins $22 billion worth of real-world assets, but Citi analysts have projected that the sector could reach $5 trillion by the end of the decade. Having a big balance sheet gives Securitize the opportunity to participate in consolidating the industry, as opposed to being scooped up by a larger firm, Domingo said. Domingo said that Securitize’s public debut will likely take place early next year, depending on how the regulatory process plays out and when the U.S. government shutdown ends. “We’ve built a real company with 230 employees, revenue, growth, [and] profits,” he said. “We’re just scratching the surface of what the industry is.” Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2025 Decrypt Media, Inc.

Title: BlackRock Holds the Line as Bitcoin ETFs Reveal Fragile Foundations | US Crypto News
URL: https://beincrypto.com/blackrock-bitcoin-etf-dominance-us-crypto-news/
Time Published: 2025-10-28T15:20:36Z

Written byLockridge Okoth Edited byMohammad Shahid Welcome to the US Crypto News Morning Briefing—your essential rundown of the most important developments in crypto for the day ahead. Grab a coffee to read how institutional flows tell a story of dominance, dependency, and deep accumulation. At the center stands BlackRock, propping up a fragile ETF ecosystem that may not stand so tall without it. BlackRock’s IBIT contributed $28.1 billion in year-to-date net inflows to US Bitcoin ETFs, surpassing sector gains and revealing a fragile foundation for institutional crypto adoption. Outside IBIT, Bitcoin ETFs faced negative flows, raising concerns over broader market confidence. On October 27, US Bitcoin ETFs saw inflows of 1,300 BTC (about $149.3 million), equal to three days’ worth of new Bitcoin. This demonstrates lasting institutional demand, yet nearly all of it goes through IBIT. Competitors continue to face challenges, even as interest in digital assets grows. Recent figures show a stark pattern. BlackRock’s IBIT has driven the net positive flows for US Bitcoin ETFs, outpacing rivals. According to Farside Investors, US Bitcoin ETFs reported $26.9 billion in net inflows this year, but $28.1 billion came from IBIT. Without IBIT, flows in other ETFs, such as Fidelity’s FBTC and Bitwise’s BITB, were flat or negative. “No BlackRock, no party? BTC ETFs are up $26.9bn YTD, yet $28.1bn stems from BlackRock’s IBIT. Ex-IBIT, flows are negative. BlackRock is absent from the imminent altcoin ETF wave. Opportunity for competitors to secure strong flows, but on net, likely limiting for overall flows,” wrote Velte Lunde, head of research at K33 Research. This reliance on one fund signals a critical vulnerability. If BlackRock scales back, institutional inflows could fade quickly. Such concentration can shape the perception of ongoing institutional confidence in global finance. On the same day as notable Bitcoin inflows, US Ethereum ETFs added 32,220 ETH, worth $133.9 million according to Farside. While significant, no Ethereum ETF has achieved IBIT’s dominance. This indicates growing yet more distributed interest from institutions exploring beyond Bitcoin. Meanwhile, Bitwise data shows that banks, asset managers, and payment companies treat crypto as a core part of finance. Transitioning from niche to mainstream, large firms are deepening exposure through custody, tokenization, and ETF products. This kind of change would have been unlikely just a few years ago. “Institutions are quietly going all in. Banks, funds, and payment giants keep adding exposure every week. Crypto’s no longer a side bet – it’s becoming part of the system,” wrote analyst Kyle Doops. Research by CoinShares confirms this trend. Bitcoin investment products drew $931 million in inflows for the week ending October 24, 2025, bringing the annual total to $30.2 billion. Yet, a sharp outflow the previous week highlights ongoing volatility and shifting sentiment that still affect the crypto markets.

Title: Forget the debasement trade: 2 reasons the US is the best place to keep your money, according to BlackRock chief Larry Fink.

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Larry Fink isn't losing a lot of sleep over the debasement trade. The BlackRock CEO said he's still confident that US assets are the best place for investors to park their cash for at least the next 18 months. That's despite fears swirling around the debasement trade, which is the idea that investors are fleeing from dollar-denominated assets due to concerns that the US dollar is losing value, and that rising debt levels and deficit spending will broadly hurt fiat currencies. "Money is going to move around all the time. But I would say most global investors have a very large overweight in the US and I think that's going to be the best place to have your overweighting for at least the next 18 months," Fink said, speaking at a panel discussion in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday. There are a few reasons Fink thinks investors' focus should still be on US markets. First, the sell-off in US assets earlier this year has largely reversed. Investors fled US stocks and other dollar assets in early 2025 as concerns mounted over tariffs, America's credit rating, and the nation's growing debt balance. But that move has largely reversed in recent months, Fink said. Foreign demand for US assets saw a strong rebound in May and June despite net selling in April, analysis from Apollo Global Management showed. Meanwhile, other safe-haven alternatives to US assets, like gold, are retreating after a big rally that some observers say was largely driven by FOMO rather than fundamental fears about financial stability. Second, there's huge faith in the investment being poured into the US, Fink said. He pointed in particular to capital expenditures spending related to AI, tech, energy infrastructure, and data centers. Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, and Google — four of the biggest companies at the center of the artificial intelligence boom — could be on track to spend as much as $320 billion on capex this year, according to a Business Insider analysis of the companies' financial statements. "You're seeing all that happening more in the United States than most places in the world today," Fink said, attributing large investment to why the US GDP has outpaced European nations. Other market pros have expressed doubt over the debasement theory. JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, and Apollo are among the top Wall Street forecasters that have been skeptical about the "sell America" narrative this year, thanks largely to the excitement for investment opportunities in the US. The US dollar has also remained stable against other currencies in recent months, Capital Economics said in a note to clients on Monday. The 10-year US Treasury has also rallied, the firm added, signaling that investors haven't lost confidence in Treasurys. Jump to

Title: Tariffs Fuel Inflation Fears Among Insurance Companies

Time Published: 2025-10-28T14:14:00Z

Insurance firms see inflation as the biggest threat to their investment strategy over the next year, per a BlackRock report. The possibility that tariff wars will create a knock-on effect leading to higher inflation over the next year is by far the biggest concern among insurance companies during that time period, according to BlackRock’s annual “Global Insurance Report.” “Inflation remains a key concern, particularly with the renewed imposition of tariffs and their potential ripple effects,” the report stated. “Escalating geopolitical tensions and increasing market fragmentation are also shaping insurers’ investment strategies and outlook.” The report also noted that the sustained higher-interest-rate environment, combined with ongoing regulatory developments, is forcing insurance firms to adjust their strategies “to navigate a rapidly evolving landscape.” The report analyzed a survey of 463 senior investment professionals at firms representing an aggregate of $23 trillion in assets under management. It found that 63% of those surveyed cited inflation risk when asked what they consider to be the “most serious macro conditions” affecting their companies’ investment strategy during the next 12 months. This is a big jump from last year, when inflation risk ranked fifth, with only 46% of insurers saying it worried them the most. Never miss a story — sign up for CIO newsletters to stay up-to-date on the latest institutional investment industry news.  With respondents able to select more than one option, “rising geopolitical tension and fragmentation” was a distant second, with 50% naming it as their biggest concern. A “high-rate environment” was cited by 42%, while “regulatory developments” and “recession risk” were cited by 40% and 35% of respondents, respectively. In last year’s survey, the top concern among insurance companies was regulatory developments, cited by 68% of respondents, followed by rising geopolitical tensions and a high-rate environment at 61% and 58%, respectively, while 50% cited the risk of a recession. This year’s report also found that insurance companies have lost their appetite to increase risk, down to just 12% in 2025 from 60% in 2021. However, they are still eating up private market investments, with 30% of insurers saying they expect to increase their allocation to the asset class over the next 12 months and only 12% reporting they plan to cut back on private assets. Some 79% said they plan to raise their allocation to private markets by 1% to 5%; 13% said they expect to increase their exposure to private markets by 6% to 9%; and 1% said they plan to boost their private assets by at least 10% over the next 12 months. Within private markets, insurance companies reported the most interest in single-strategy direct lending, named by 39% of respondents, followed by special situations/opportunistic investments at 38% and citing infrastructure debt at 37%.

Solana officially joins Bitcoin and Ethereum in the ETF arena as the first U.S. spot Solana ETFs go live. 📌 What Happened Four new crypto ETFs will begin trading this week across Nasdaq and the NYSE, led by Solana, Litecoin, and Hedera. The big headline is Solana, which will see two ETFs go live: The Bitwise ETF will track 100% spot SOL and is designed to participate in staking, meaning it could compound yield through validator rewards over time. The Litecoin and Hedera ETFs, both from Canary Capital, also begin trading Tuesday. This is the first wave of altcoin ETFs to reach U.S. markets after the Bitcoin ETF launch in January and Ethereum ETF rollout in July. 🗣️ What They’re Saying “Confirmed. The Exchange has just posted listing notices for Bitwise Solana, Canary Litecoin and Canary HBAR to launch TOMORROW and grayscale Solana to convert the day after. Assuming there’s not some last min SEC intervention, looks like this is happening.” - Eric Balchunas, Senior ETF Analyst for Bloomberg 🧠 Why It Matters Solana enters ETF land with serious momentum. SOL is now a top-5 crypto by market cap, trading near $200, and continues to dominate usage metrics with higher daily transactions than Ethereum. And the Solana ETF unlocks new access to SOL for retirement accounts, wealth advisors, and institutional portfolios that can’t touch crypto directly. It deepens liquidity and puts Solana in the same regulated bucket as BTC and ETH, something nearly unthinkable during the FTX collapse just two years ago. That means inflows and diversification buying is incoming. But, with that said, there is one key difference between these SOL ETFs and BTC & ETH - BlackRock isn’t at the table (yet). BlackRock’s IBIT (BTC) and ETHA (ETH) are the dominant players in their respective categories of ETFs. IBIT has seen $65B in net inflows. The next biggest is FBTC at $12B (so 5x bigger). Similarly, ETHA has seen $14.2B in net inflows. The next biggest is Fidelity’s FETH at $2.69B (also ~5x bigger). So while there is reason to celebrate these new ETFs, especially for SOL - take them with a grain of salt. And pop the champagne when BlackRock announces their SOL ETF… A few Crypto and Web3 headlines that caught my eye: In Corporate Treasuries / ETFs In Memes Here’s a rundown of major token, protocol and airdrop news from the day: Here is the list of other notable headlines from the day in NFTs: Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2025 Decrypt Media, Inc.

Title: Tesla chairwoman warns Musk could quit if shareholders reject $1tn pay deal

Tesla chairwoman Robyn Denholm has stepped up her campaign to win shareholder support for Elon Musk’s $1 trillion (€859 billion) pay package, warning there is no “Elon mark 2” if the carmaker’s board is forced to try to replace the chief executive. Ms Denholm and other Tesla board members are meeting this week with the company’s largest institutional investors, which include Vanguard, BlackRock and State Street, to lobby for the plan in advance of a vote on November 6th. Mr Musk has threatened to walk out if shareholders vote down a new package of stock options that could be worth up to $1 trillion over the next decade. Ms Denholm confirmed that Mr Musk’s public threats had also been communicated privately to the board, but refused to explain Tesla’s contingency plan if shareholders reject the pay deal. Ms Denholm has also written to shareholders warning of his potential departure if his package is not approved. “This is a vote for shareholders on the future of Tesla,” Ms Denholm told the Financial Times. “There’s just not anybody, either inside or outside the organisation, that is Elon today,” she said. Mr Musk’s pay has been the centre of years of controversy and legal wrangling. Last year, shareholders voted in favour of a previous $56 billion pay deal. That package was originally awarded in 2018 but subsequently blocked by a Delaware court, which said the process lacked proper board oversight. The new proposal is expected to face significant opposition after advisory groups Glass Lewis and ISS recommended that shareholders reject the proposals. A group of big pension funds separately issued an open letter opposing the pay plan, claiming the board’s “relentless pursuit” of retaining its chief executive had damaged Tesla’s reputation and led to excessive compensation. On Monday, the head of the New York pension fund called the pay proposal “inflated and poorly designed” and urged investors to vote against it. Mr Musk responded to the criticism on X, the social media site he owns, last week: “Tesla is worth more than all other automotive companies combined. Which of those CEOs would you like to run Tesla? It won’t be me.” The fortune of the world’s richest man is largely tied up in the value of Tesla’s shares, which have more than tripled in value over the past five years as the carmaker’s market capitalisation soared to $1.4 trillion. Asked what the board will do if Tesla loses the vote and cannot retain Mr Musk, Ms Denholm said: “I don’t want to foreshadow anything on that front at this moment, but clearly, as a board, we have discussed what happens and we know that it wouldn’t be a good outcome for shareholders.” “If we don’t have Elon at the helm, or he isn’t as motivated or incentivised to actually create that future, then it’s actually a negative for all shareholders.” She added that she did not believe Mr Musk would do anything “sudden and detrimental” if Tesla loses the vote. Mr Musk has used large quantities of his Tesla shares as security to borrow billions of dollars to fund his other ventures, such as his acquisition of Twitter, now X, in 2022 and the development of his artificial intelligence start-up, xAI. He currently owns a 15 per cent stake in Tesla and is able to vote his shares in favour of the compensation plan. Tesla has warned investors that Mr Musk’s leadership is crucial to a strategic pivot into AI, including through autonomous driving and its plans to build millions of humanoid “Optimus” robots. Mr Musk has argued he needs to control at least a quarter of Tesla’s voting rights to stop its AI products falling into the wrong hands, using the example of him being ousted by activist investors. Last week, Mr Musk branded Glass Lewis and ISS “corporate terrorists” and said: “I just don’t feel comfortable building a robot army and then being ousted because of some asinine recommendations from ISS and Glass Lewis who have no freaking clue.” Ms Denholm told the FT that the special committee set up to design the pay package – which was made up of her and director Kathleen Wilson-Thompson – explored whether there was a way to give Mr Musk the voting rights he wanted without the vast payout. “There wasn’t an instrument that you could use that could do that,” she said. “We searched high and low for it, but we ended up using restricted stock, which does have economic rights.” The proposed $1 trillion compensation award includes 12 tranches of restricted stock that are each tied to ambitious milestones for its share price and operational performance. It would grant Mr Musk an additional 12 per cent of Tesla’s shares if he increases its valuation to $8.5tn, boosts earnings 24-fold and sell millions more cars and robots. Achieving even half of those targets could make him the world’s first trillionaire. Shareholders will also vote on a string of other proposals next week, including the reappointment of three directors and whether Tesla can invest in xAI. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2025 Join The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to date Sign up to the Business Today newsletter for the latest new and commentary in your inbox Listen to Inside Business podcast for a look at business and economics from an Irish perspective Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire said the project has “remarkable early momentum,” in a press release. “Arc presents the opportunity for every type of company to build on enterprise-grade network infrastructure—advancing a shared vision that a more open, inclusive, and efficient global economic system can be built natively on the internet,” he added. A testnet is separate blockchain mimicking the main blockchain network and using simulated assets, enabling developers to test new features without risking the security of the live mainnet. Companies with “billions of users” have participated in the launch, with Wall Street firms and global banks including BNY, Intercontinental Exchange, and State Street joining the Arc testnet. Wall Street giants already on the platform include BlackRock, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, HSBC, and Standard Chartered. There are also established tech and payments companies participating, including Amazon Web Services, Cloudflare, Mastercard, and Visa. Several crypto exchanges, including Coinbase, Kraken, and Robinhood, are also taking part in the testnet. The blockchain network, which Circle bills as an "Economic Operating System" for the internet, aims to bring more economic activity onto blockchain infrastructure with features including predictable dollar-based fees, sub-second transaction finality, and optional privacy configurations. Circle said its Arc platform is designed to support financial applications including lending, capital markets, foreign exchange, and global payments. The network integrates with Circle's existing platform and enables the use of stablecoins—digital currencies pegged to traditional currencies. Several regional stablecoin issuers have joined the testnet, including JPYC from Japan, BRLA from Brazil, and QCAD from Canada. Circle, which issues the USDC stablecoin, is working to bring additional dollar and euro stablecoin issuers onto the platform. While Circle is currently stewarding Arc's development, the company said it plans to transition the network toward distributed governance. The long-term vision includes expanding validator participation and establishing community-driven governance frameworks.

Reuters 28/10/2025 09h41 • Atualizado 1 dia atrás 28/10/2025 09h41 • Atualizado 1 dia atrás Publicidade (Reuters) – Os Estados Unidos continuarão a atrair a grande maioria dos fluxos de investimento e os riscos de uma desaceleração na maior economia do mundo são exagerados, disseram chefes de algumas das principais empresas financeiras em uma conferência na Arábia Saudita nesta terça-feira. Os mercados acionários dos EUA atingiram recordes de alta, à medida que enormes somas de dinheiro são investidas no país para apostar na IA, levando alguns executivos e banqueiros centrais a alertar sobre riscos crescentes de uma bolha e de uma correção do mercado. Outros investidores se preocupam com a crescente dívida do governo sob o comando do presidente Donald Trump e com o impacto de suas tarifas comerciais. Ainda assim, executivos da Future Investment Initiative (FII), em Riad, passaram a maior parte do tempo falando com entusiasmo sobre perspectivas para os EUA, dizendo que o país se compara favoravelmente à Europa e a partes da Ásia. O presidente-executivo da BlackRock, a maior administradora de ativos do mundo, disse que o dinheiro tem voltado para os Estados Unidos principalmente nos últimos dois meses, revertendo uma saída de ativos em dólares no início do ano. “A maioria dos investidores globais tem um grande excesso de peso nos EUA e esse é o lugar para manter seu excesso de peso nos próximos 18 meses”, disse Larry Fink. Continua depois da publicidade O presidente-executivo do Goldman Sachs, David Solomon, disse que a “grande maioria da alocação de capital” está em ativos em dólares e que não há um catalisador óbvio para uma desaceleração econômica nos Estados Unidos nos próximos 6 a 12 meses. O presidente-executivo da Blackstone, Stephen Schwarzman, disse estar confiante de que os EUA e a China farão um progresso significativo para a conclusão de um acordo comercial, com Trump se reunindo com o primeiro-ministro chinês nesta semana. O fundador da Pershing Square Capital Management, Bill Ackman, minimizou preocupações com os níveis de endividamento do governo dos EUA, destacando a força e a escala dos ativos do governo, enquanto todos se concentram em seus passivos.

October 28, 2025 05:35 ET | Source: MOVA MOVA DUBAI, United Arab Emirates, Oct. 28, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- At the Palazzo Versace Dubai in the United Arab Emirates, MOVA successfully hosted the “Vision 2030: Global Digital Economy & Brand Excellence Summit.” Distinguished guests attending the summit included:Mr. Mohammed Al Ahbabi from the UAE Ministry of Economy and Tourism;Mr. Shehab Bin Nouri from the Al Maktoum Royal Family Private Office;Mr. Khalifa Al Mazrouei from UAE Capital Group;Mr. Peter Hacham, representative of Mubadala’s Hub71 sovereign fund;Professor Peter Knez, former Investment Director at BlackRock (USA) and Chairman of Palm Global (Abu Dhabi);Mr. Samir M. Suleymanov from the World Bank’s New Economy Industry Department;Ms. Nancy Guan, Secretary-General of the International Olympic Arts Development Committee;Mr. Eric Lee, CEO of Bithumb (Korea Exchange);Mr. Bobby Zhou, Co-founder of Aqua Labs;and Ms. Christina Wang, Chief Representative of PIF China. (USD1SWAP members with Bithumb CEO Eric Lee) The summit brought together global industry leaders, capital institutions, and technology innovators to discuss the future of RWA (Real World Asset) tokenization, public blockchain ecosystems, and brand digitalization. Beyond exploring global trends in the digital economy, the event also provided an important platform for USD1SWAP and the MOVA ecosystem to showcase their latest developments. USD1SWAP: Bridging the Real and Digital Asset Worlds As a key player in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, USD1SWAP became one of the highlights of the event. USD1SWAP’s Chief Marketing Officer, Smith, delivered a keynote speech elaborating on the project’s strategic positioning within the global digital economy—particularly focusing on liquidity solutions and decentralized financial infrastructure built on the MOVA blockchain. Smith emphasized that USD1SWAP aims to provide a secure and transparent channel for global asset exchange through innovative cross-chain liquidity protocols and intelligent risk control systems. “In the future, USD1SWAP will be more than just a decentralized trading platform—it will become a vital bridge between traditional finance and the Web3 world,” said Smith. As a major application on the MOVA chain, USD1SWAP is driving the tokenization of real-world assets, opening new possibilities for the circulation of digital assets worldwide. Global Collaboration in RWA Tokenization and Brand Digitalization The summit centered on two major themes: RWA tokenization and brand digital transformation—both of which align with USD1SWAP’s long-term strategic direction. Smith noted that as stablecoin models and cross-chain technologies mature, traditional assets such as real estate, energy, and commodities are entering a new era of digital transformation. “Digital assets are no longer confined to cryptocurrencies—they are increasingly linked to real-world asset value, forming an entirely new global capital structure,” Smith explained. Through its RWA on-chain protocol, USD1SWAP enables liquidity and value mapping for real assets, helping traditional financial assets transition smoothly into the decentralized digital economy. This strategy complements the MOVA ecosystem, jointly advancing asset digitalization and public blockchain development—ultimately creating a seamless, secure cross-chain value exchange network for users worldwide. MOVA: Strategic Partnership Empowering USD1SWAP’s Growth As a core component of the MOVA blockchain, USD1SWAP collaborates closely with MOVA on asset mapping, cross-chain liquidity, and brand digitalization initiatives. MOVA CEO Wael Muhaisen also delivered an inspiring address at the summit, highlighting the pivotal role of the MOVA chain in advancing decentralized finance and brand ecosystems. Wael noted that MOVA is not just a smart contract platform—it is the foundational engine for global decentralized asset exchange and ownership verification. The distinguished guests at the summit discussed the latest trends in RWA tokenization and cross-chain liquidity in the global financial market, offering strategic insights and validation for the USD1SWAP and MOVA ecosystems. By fostering deep integration among global capital markets, governments, and technology sectors, USD1SWAP is not only laying the technological groundwork for decentralized finance but also providing strong momentum for the convergence of capital and innovation.

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. The crypto market, despite experiencing throughout the year major price fluctuations, security incidents, and legal hurdles, has experienced remarkable growth. This can be attributed to the expansion of digital asset treasuries (DATs), increased institutional adoption, and new initiatives aimed at integrating digital assets, particularly stablecoins, into traditional financial sectors. Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) recently shared their projections for the crypto landscape for the remainder of the year and years to come, highlighting nine key trends expected to be major catalysts for the industry. Firstly, market structure legislation in the US is expected to emerge as a critical priority for policymakers and Congress, establishing a clear regulatory framework that supports crypto developers. The passage of the GENIUS Act in July of this year also marked a pivotal moment, garnering bipartisan support and providing builders with much-needed certainty in their endeavors. Secondly, the adoption of stablecoins is set to accelerate as network effects take hold among financial institutions, merchants, and consumers, thereby enhancing the global standing of the US dollar. Furthermore, major players like JPMorgan, Citi, BlackRock, and Fidelity are amplifying their crypto offerings through new product launches, partnerships, and acquisitions. The infrastructure supporting blockchain technology is also advancing rapidly. Current networks can process over 3,400 transactions per second, marking a 100-fold increase over the past five years. Moreover, a new wave of real-world assets (RWAs) is transitioning onto the blockchain as the worlds of crypto and traditional finance converge. The market for tokenized real-world assets has expanded to nearly $30 billion, with significant contributions from Treasuries, money market funds, and private credit. In parallel, the crypto sector is attracting a growing pool of talent, driven by a more favorable regulatory environment and the emergence of new opportunities for developers. The focus on revenue generation is also shifting within the token ecosystem. More tokens are implementing fee mechanisms, redirecting attention toward fundamental value. In the past year, users have paid $33 billion in fees, resulting in $18 billion for projects and $4 billion for token holders. Innovative consumer products are also expected to drive the next wave of crypto adoption. Although approximately 716 million people now own cryptocurrency, only 40 to 70 million are considered active users. Ultimately, 2025 is poised to lay the groundwork and establish the foundations for the years to come. It is expected to be a transformative year for the crypto industry, characterized by widespread institutional adoption, regulatory clarity, and tangible utility.

Title: Trump administration narrows list of potential Federal Reserve chairs to 5

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Monday confirmed the names of five candidates to replace Jerome Powell as chair of the powerful Federal Reserve next year WASHINGTON -- Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Monday confirmed the names of five candidates to replace Jerome Powell as chair of the powerful Federal Reserve next year. On an Air Force One flight to Asia with President Donald Trump, Bessent said he would engage in a second round of interviews in the coming weeks and present a “good slate” of candidates to Trump “right after Thanksgiving.” Trump said he expected to decide on Powell's replacement by the end of this year. The five people under consideration are: Federal Reserve governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman; former Fed governor Kevin Warsh; White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett; and Rick Rieder, senior managing director at asset manager BlackRock. The names suggest that no matter who is picked, there will likely be big changes coming to the Federal Reserve next year. Bessent, who is leading the search for Powell's replacement, last month published extensive criticisms of the Fed and some of the policies it has pursued from the Great Financial Crisis of 2008-2009 to the pandemic. Trump on Monday, meanwhile, repeated his long-standing attacks on Powell, charging that he has been too slow to cut interest rates. “We have a person that’s not at all smart right now," Trump said, referring to Powell. “He should have been much lower, much sooner.” The Fed is expected to lower its key rate Wednesday for the second time this year. Trump's goal of selecting a new chair by the end of this year could reflect some of the tricky elements surrounding Powell's status. His term as chair ends next May, but he could remain on the Fed's board as one of seven governors until January 2028, an unusual but not entirely unprecedented step. Such a move would deprive Trump of an opportunity to nominate another governor for several years. Still, current governor Stephen Miran was appointed by Trump Sept. 16 to finish an unexpired term that ends next Jan. 31. Trump could nominate his candidate to replace Powell for that seat, and then elevate that person to chair in May after Powell steps down. Hassett is currently the chair of the National Economic Council at the White House and was also a top Trump adviser in the president's first term, and a frequent defender of the administration's policies on television. His longtime loyalty to the president could give him an edge, some Fed watchers say. Warsh is a former economic advisor in the George W. Bush administration and was appointed to the Fed's governing board in 2006 at age 35, making him the youngest Fed governor in history. He left the board in 2011. Warsh is now a fellow at the Hoover Institution and a lecturer at the Stanford Graduate School of Business. Waller was appointed to the Fed by Trump in 2020, and quickly established himself as an independent voice. He began pushing for rate cuts in July and dissented at that meeting in favor of a quarter-point cut, when the Fed decided to leave its key rate unchanged. But he voted to reduce rates just a quarter-point in September, along with 10 other Fed officials, while Miran dissented in favor of a half-point. Michelle Bowman is the Fed's vice chair of supervision, making her the nation's top banking regulator. She was appointed by Trump in 2018, and before that was Kansas' state bank commissioner. Bowman also dissented in favor a rate cut in July, then voted with her colleagues last month for a quarter-point reduction. Rieder has the most financial markets experience of any of the candidates and has worked for Wall Street firms since 1987. Rieder joined BlackRock in 2009. His focus is in fixed income and he oversees the management of roughly $2.4 trillion in assets. Bessent has set out a wide-ranging critique of the Fed while interviewing for Powell's replacement. In particular, he has criticized the central bank for continuing unconventional policies, such as purchasing Treasury bonds in order to lower longer-term interest rates, long after after such steps were justified, in his view, by emergency conditions. “It is essential the Fed commit to scaling back its distortionary impact on markets," Bessent wrote. “It also likely requires an honest, independent, and nonpartisan review of the entire institution and all of its activities.” Bessent's criticisms aren't entirely new, but they have gained greater traction in the wake of the 2021-22 inflation surge. The Fed is mandated by Congress to seek stable prices as well as maximum employment. Bessent's critiques have also inevitably been tangled up with Trump's insistent calls for lower interest rates, which have threatened the Fed's independence from day-to-day politics. Trump has also taken the unprecedented step of trying to fire Fed governor Lisa Cook, a Biden appointee, to open another seat on the board for him to fill. Cook has sued to keep her seat and the Supreme Court has allowed Cook to remain on the board while it considers the case. Trump's attacks on the central bank have left some longtime Fed critics skeptical of the Trump administration's approach. Peter Conti-Brown, a Fed historian and professor of financial regulation at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, cautioned against placing “loyalists” on the Fed “who are there to push the president’s narrative.” “Those are the ones that we want as his advisers and spokespeople and his lawyers, not his central bankers,” he said.

Full Content:
Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent confirmed President Donald Trump has five potential successors to serve as Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s successor when his term ends in May 2026. On Air Force One Monday, Bessent told reporters Trump is considering nominating Kevin Hassett, former Kevin Warsh, Michelle Bowman, Christopher Waller, or Rick Rieder to replace Powell. The Federal Reserve Chair serves a four-year term, which is renewable. However, Trump has been vocal about wanting to replace Powell, whom he sees as an obstacle to enacting his economic agenda and rescuing America’s middle class from the decline it had under the Biden administration. While all of Trump’s potential replacements are described as inflation hawks who generally favor interest rate cuts, their stances differ on supporting Trump’s ambitious economic agenda, which includes lower interest rates to boost growth, reduce debt servicing costs, and support policies like tariffs. President Trump says he expects to make a decision on the next Fed Chair before the end of the year. Bessent confirms the five finalists to reporters on Air Force One: – Governor Christopher Waller – Governor Michelle Bowman – Former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh – NEC Director… — annmarie hordern (@annmarie) October 27, 2025 Kevin Hassett (White House Economic Adviser): Hassett, as Trump’s longest-serving economic advisor and National Economic Council (NEC) Director, is among the leading candidates to be the next Fed chair, according to a July Washington Post article. He has been a vocal critic of Powell’s tenure at the Federal Reserve and has publicly argued that rates should be at least three percentage points lower than they are now. He has accused Powell and the rest of the board of partisanship in decision-making for refusing to cut rates, the Economic Times reported. (Sign up for Mary Rooke’s weekly newsletter here!) While he publicly supports Fed independence from political influence, his alignment with Trump’s economic policies, including tariffs, suggests he would prioritize lower rates to reduce debt costs and stimulate the economy. During Trump’s first term, Hassett championed the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, defending it as a driver of middle-class benefits through increased investment and earnings growth. He has advocated pro-growth stimulus and tax policies to achieve 4 % GDP growth, emphasizing opportunities for the middle class. Kevin Hassett is both kind and brilliant. As Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, he has been instrumental in advancing this Admin’s pro-growth economic agenda & lifting America’s hard-working families. Kevin is a dear friend & will be missed! Thankful for his service! — Ivanka Trump (@IvankaTrump) June 7, 2019 This makes Hassett the most likely to support an economic agenda that promotes middle-class growth. Kevin Warsh (Former Fed Governor): Warsh served on the Fed Board under the administration of former President George W. Bush. Like Hassett, Warsh has criticized the Fed’s decision not to cut interest rates. In April, speaking at a conference organized by the Group of Thirty, an international body of financiers and academics, Warsh urged the Fed to stop relying on “stale” government data in setting monetary policy. He also warned against sharing their “latest musings” on economic forecasts, as it makes it harder to secure “stable prices and full employment.” Kevin Warsh on Fox Business: The Fed can “lower interest rates a lot” to get mortgage rates down. Warsh also says the Fed should shrink its balance sheet to “redeploy that money to Main Street so that Main Street can have the strong economy that we’re seeing in financial… — Nick Timiraos (@NickTimiraos) October 24, 2025 “The more the Fed opines on matters outside of its remit, the more it jeopardizes its ability to ensure stable prices and full employment, and the more vulnerable it becomes to the body politic,” Warsh said, adding, “Each time the Fed jumps into action, the more it expands its size and scope, encroaching further on other macroeconomic domains.” While Warsh has been a vocal critic of the Fed board since his departure, he has historically been staunchly pro-free trade, which clashes with Trump’s tariff policies, making him slightly less aligned with aggressive middle-class-focused fiscal agendas than Hassett. Michelle Bowman (Current Fed Governor): Bowman, a Trump appointee from 2018, has repeatedly signaled that she supports raising rates to combat inflation if it does not reach the Fed’s 2% inflation target, rather than Trump’s wish for massive rate cuts to induce rapid easing to stimulate the economy. Bowman’s preference for restrictive monetary policies makes her among the least likely to advance Trump’s agenda to cut rates. However, Bowman’s desire to push gradual rate adjustments to maintain full employment and economic resilience aligns exceptionally well with Trump’s plan to grow the middle class. They may not see eye to eye on how to get there, but their end goal seems the same. Christopher Waller (Current Fed Governor): Waller, another Trump appointee from 2020, supported massive rate hikes during the Biden Administration to combat rising prices. Similar to Bowman, Waller advocates gradual rate adjustments to maintain the Fed’s progress on slowing inflation without overstimulating the economy. His balanced approach aligns somewhat with Trump’s push for lower rates. Still, his emphasis on data-driven caution runs counter to Warsh’s view that government data is an unreliable marker because it is constantly revised. Federal Reserve Gov. Christopher Waller: “We need to start cutting rates at the next meeting… Over the next 3-6 months, we could see multiple cuts coming in.” pic.twitter.com/LLqx6biszH — Rapid Response 47 (@RapidResponse47) September 3, 2025 He has analyzed the inflationary effects of tariffs and advocates cautious rate cuts to avoid labor-market risks. And while Waller supports stable growth, there is no indication that his monetary policies would help a middle-class boom. Rick Rieder (BlackRock Executive): Unlike the other four picks, Rieder has never worked on the Federal Reserve Board or in any federal economic role. Instead, Rieder comes from the private sector, serving as BlackRock’s chief investment officer for global fixed income. He is a veteran of the bond market. He aligns with Trump’s economic agenda, which argues that the Fed’s high interest rates could contribute to inflation by boosting corporate incomes and spending while restricting middle-class growth. However, like Waller, Rieder sees Trump’s trademark tariffs as an inflation driver. Despite his tariff concerns, he supports rate cuts. Rieder is a unique choice as he’s one of the few who focus on U.S. growth driven by AI. As a fixed-income investor, he favors lower rates and opportunities in income-generating assets, which could indirectly benefit middle-class savers. However, his focus is not on growing America’s middle class, but rather market growth, making him less likely to push Trump’s middle-class agenda if it conflicts with his more market-oriented agenda. (ROOKE: Biden Deep Stater Sings Trump’s Praises On Foreign Policy Wins) Of the five possible Powell replacements, Hassett seems most focused on middle-class growth. And while his Fed Chair role would center strictly on monetary tools rather than policies, he could coordinate closely with Trump’s economic agenda to amplify the middle class.

Title: Inside BlackRock’s Approach to Systematic Investing

Jeff Shen, co-head of BlackRock Systematic Equities, discusses in depth how his team uses data and technology to generate consistent alpha. October 27, 2025 In a world where asset managers strive to differentiate themselves from the competition and capture the attention of financial advisors, one approach has been systematic investing. Systematic investing involves using a repeatable, rules-based process, often paired with the use of technology, to come up with investment recommendations based on insights gleaned from both traditional economic and alternative data. According to BlackRock Systematic, a division of global investment giant BlackRock with $336 billion in AUM, its approach to systematic investing is aimed at delivering consistent alpha returns, even through periods of market volatility. Over a five-year period, BlackRock Systematic claims that roughly 90% of its funds have outperformed peer medians. BlackRock’s Systematic investing team, which comprises 230 people globally, has experimented with techniques such as using machine learning for portfolio construction and works on an investment horizon of three to four months, according to Jeff Shen, PhD, co-chief investment officer and co-head of BlackRock Systematic Equities. The number of market signals the team relies on to make its investment decisions has grown from just three when it started in 1985 to over 1,000 today. WealthManagement.com recently spoke to Shen about the evolution of systematic investing approach, what types of data sets it uses, how it incorporates AI and large language models into the process and why Shen’s team focuses on active equities strategies. Related:Wealth Management Invest: Building Resilient Portfolios with Vanguard’s Todd Schlanger This Q&A has been edited for length, style and clarity. WM: Can you talk about how BlackRock’s approach to systematic investing is different from competitors? Jeff Shen: What we do is try to take interesting data—could be traditional data, could be alternative data—and use advanced techniques, such as machine learning, AI and translate that data through modern techniques into forecasts for active portfolios. We are hoping it will generate consistent and differentiated alpha over different market cycles. Compared to our competitors, what sets us apart is the usage of alternative data through modern techniques, especially learning AI systems. Also, having an investment horizon that’s three to four months is a little bit distinctive. A lot of quant shops can have pretty short investment horizons, sometimes intra-day. For us, it’s an intermediate horizon. The last thing I want to mention is that we think about this as a team sport. It’s 230 people working together across the globe, across asset classes and trying to bring that together in one platform. Related:Morningstar: Short-Term Active Fund Outperformance Is Often Random WM: Can you give me some examples of the alternative data you’ve mentioned? JS: One is a macro example. The labor market is certainly a big variable that the Federal Reserve looks at very carefully. We have been looking at job posting data over the past six to seven years. At any moment in time in the U.S., there are about 30 million job postings populated on different websites—company websites, some of the aggregated websites. That gives you a bit of a sense of the health of the economy, who’s hiring, the velocity of hiring, wage inflation because some of the postings indicate their wage range. In that way, you can get a bit of a sense of the propensity of the labor market, the health of the labor market, but also forward-looking inflation indications. It covers both private and public companies, so it gives you a pretty good sense of the overall labor market. A second example has a little more to do with social media information. We are not interested in individual posts, but the aggregated market sentiment we can draw from social media to use a company as a unit of analysis and see what people, whether retail investors or maybe other firms, are saying about different stocks. And then we try to draw a little bit of the retail sentiment through social media on different companies. Related:Orion Unveils Portfolios Combining Direct Indexing, Third-Party Models The technology underneath it is the use of language processing, and large language models clearly come into play as well. WM: What has changed over the past several years in terms of the kind of data and tools you might be using? What new techniques are you seeing rapidly developed in this field? JS: If you go to the last couple of years, one obvious one is the large language model. ChatGPT was released about two years ago. We had a couple of natural language processing insights that we were already using to transform our technology six or seven months before the release of ChatGPT. Nevertheless, we are using a lot of those technologies, generative AI, large language models, to read through a lot of these alternative data sets and social media, financial news, regulatory filings. You can really think about using machines to read through a lot of these texts, to try read between the lines, to try to find sentiment and interesting insights. That stack of technology continues to evolve, and there are a lot more exciting things on the horizon—multi-language, multi-modal. In addition to text, think about voice, video, image. The less obvious development has to do with thinking about using machine learning for portfolio construction. Mean variance optimization—maximize returns, minimize risk—has been around for a long time, and there have been pretty interesting developments in using machine learning, using neural networks in particular, for portfolio construction. That part may come as a bit differentiating and may be a surprise to people. We don’t really see too much application of that type of technology in portfolio construction, but we’ve been doing quite a bit of work on that over the past couple of years, and it has been showing quite a bit of promise. WM: When it comes to using AI in your work, can you talk about the main advantages it offers and maybe some of the limitations of AI in the field of systematic investment? JS: Maybe I define AI in the narrow sense. When people talk about AI it probably has more to do with the generative AI or large language models. But in the broader sense, if you look at any of the AI book, that’s just one part. A very important part, but there are a lot of other things that are the bread and butter of AI. I’ll focus on generative AI and large language models first. The benefits are that these things are very good at reading texts and finding insights, meanings, and investment theses. So, we’ve applied that in our security selection, some of the macro investments. In that sense, it’s played the role of a financial analyst. With that investment analysis piece, you can use generative AI and large language model to not only provide efficiency, but to provide scalability. You can do this beyond one stock or one company at a time. You can do it on a large scale 24/7 with very timely updates. That creates huge efficiency and productivity, but also there is precision in terms of finding meaning from the text aspect of it. In terms of the limitations, clearly, there are two things. One is the generic large language model that you can get from a third party—Open AI, or Gemini, or Anthropic. It doesn’t necessarily cater to financial services as a vertical. So, there are limitations on deep understanding of the particular domain. The second limitation that’s particular to systematic investing is that time is an interesting challenge for large language models. If you were to do a back test or simulation, you need to make sure that the large language model only knows up to that particular time what’s going on in the world. Otherwise, you get this very strong peek-ahead bias by using an off-the-shelf large language model. If you ask, “Is Nvidia a good investment or not?” today, a large language model knows it’s a phenomenal investment. But would it be able to think about Nvidia without that knowledge in the simulation set 10 years ago? So, point in time in a large language model is certainly an important part. The last part that I want to raise is to zoom it out slightly. I do think there is a lot of excitement about generative AI and large language models, but there is a whole list of additional technologies and systems that we use that I don’t hear people talking about too much. There is reinforcement learning. There is deep learning. There is a lot more depth in AI. The fortunate thing is that a big part of our group is based in San Francisco, so we’ve had the front row seat to AI revolution for the past 15, 16 years. That’s why we are investing heavily into the space. WM: A lot of the focus in systematic investment is delivering alpha. In the past couple of years, there has been a particular focus on actively managed funds to achieve that. However, from the research we’ve seen from Morningstar, as well as comments we’ve gotten from financial advisors, it’s tough for any given fund to outperform beyond the short term. How do you deal with this dilemma, and where does the systematic investing approach come in? JS: Active management is definitely not easy. It’s a zero-sum game. From our perspective, the benefit is our history. Our U.S. equity fund was launched in September 1985. So, we have a 40-year track record of trying to beat the S&P 500, and it’s done very much that. We’ve also expanded our universe internationally, in global markets, emerging markets. There is definitely the difficulty for active managers to outperform. We come with a certain level of confidence, legacy and history. But on a forward-looking basis, to deliver that consistency of alpha over time, in our mind, it’s about innovation and innovation at scale. You’ve got to think about new insights and what’s going to be driving the market, which is always going to be a little bit different from what was driving the market before. I do think using AI and machine learning and things we have been talking about to essentially build scale for investment is becoming more important. When I say “scale,” it means “how many data sets do you have?” We spend millions and millions of dollars every year on data—technology, systems development. We are also using the BlackRock scale and reach. Trying to drive that scale for the benefit of alpha generation to try to deliver that consistency is a differentiator relative to some of the maybe smaller-scale players. WM: How do you work with financial advisors on all this? JS: We have three main sets of products that we engage with financial advisors on. There are quite a few benchmark-driven active mutual funds that we help to run to try and deliver returns that are above and beyond the S&P 500. We do have market-neutral liquid alts funds. We have a Global Equity Market Neutral Fund [BDMIX] that has actually been around for a while and is gaining quite a bit of traction, given that it’s got market-neutral characteristics. But it still delivers that alpha return for advisors. (Over a five-year period, BDMIX delivered a total return of 10.85%. The Morningstar average for the category is 7.14%.) And we’ve also gotten a few active ETFs that have gained traction. We’ve got a rotation series—it’s rotating between different factors, different themes. And we’ve got some income active ETFs as well. So, active ETFs is another way to engage with the financial advisors. WM: Among these three types of products, do you find that they appeal to different segments of the advisor ecosystem? JS: It’s a bit more firm-specific. There are people who certainly prefer an ETF type of vehicle. For model builders, active ETFs can be quite attractive. For the benchmark-driven mutual funds, clearly, among some of the wirehouses, there is quite a bit of interest in that. It’s consistent alpha with a reasonable fee, and that’s why there is a lot of traction there. And then the liquid alts fund [BlackRock Systematic Multi-Strategy Fund (BIMBX)], from a portfolio construction perspective, the advisors are essentially using it as a fixed-income replacement, as a diversifier in a portfolio. We’ve seen a high rate of adoption for that across RIAs and wirehouses. So that appeals across the spectrum. [BIMBX has delivered a total return of 4.94% over a 10-year period compared to a Morningstar category average of 3.02%.] WM: What do you include in the definition of “liquid alts”? JS: We have essentially a global equity market-neutral long-short fund. In any given country or sector, we go long on a bunch of names or short a bunch of names to keep it reasonably market-neutral so there is not too much of a net exposure. It’s very similar to a long-short equity hedge fund, but it has all of the liquid alts characteristics associated with it. It’s a daily liquidity fund. But if you take the return we generate in it and correlate it to the S&P 500, you will have a correlation pretty much close to zero. WM: In terms of building up your capabilities, have you made any outside firm acquisitions in recent years? JS: Within the BlackRock systematic group, we haven’t made any acquisitions. On the overall talent perspective, we’ve continued to invest. It’s really been an ongoing journey, investing in technology, data science, AI, machine learning, talent. What we do here, given this three-to-four month investment horizon, is try to get people who have finance/economic background, alongside people who have engineering/computer science/machine learning background and blend the two to solve the problem. From the talent strategy perspective, we’ve been continuously trying to hire top talent. One thing I want to mention that BlackRock as a firm has an AI lab that has been a firm commitment for the last six, seven years and there are a few Stanford/Berkeley professors we’ve been working with.

Anticipation is building ahead of Ripple Swell 2025, the company’s flagship conference scheduled for November 4 to 5 in New York, with a welcome reception on November 3. This year’s edition is set against a backdrop of growing institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies, and Ripple is bringing some of the world’s most powerful financial names to the stage. For the first time, the event will feature an extensive lineup of speakers from the White House and major traditional finance institutions, including BlackRock, Nasdaq, Bloomberg, and Citi. Ripple’s 2025 edition of the Swell event is turning out to be filled with the biggest roster yet. Ripple has confirmed that the 2025 edition of Swell will host top executives from some of the largest names in both the crypto industry and in traditional finance. Among the notable names are Maxwell Stein, Director of Digital Assets at BlackRock; Adena Friedman, Chief Executive Officer at Nasdaq; Sandy Kaul, Head of Innovation at Franklin Templeton; and Hunter Horsley, CEO of Bitwise Asset Management. Other confirmed participants include senior representatives from Citi, Fidelity, JPMorgan Chase, Mastercard, CME Group, Moody’s, State Street, DBS Bank, Bloomberg, and Société Générale, among many others. This roster of names is the strongest representation of traditional finance in Swell’s eight-year history. Each of these executives brings deep institutional experience in asset management, banking, and capital markets, areas that are now embracing tokenization, digital payments, and blockchain settlement, and where Ripple is looking to become a major player. Nobody wants to be left behind in the blockchain/crypto movement. Therefore, discussions are expected to focus on how these institutions are preparing to integrate blockchain-based systems into global finance, particularly for cross-border transactions, stablecoin infrastructure, and regulated digital-asset investment products. Observers are also going to be watching for major announcements from Ripple at Swell, like new partnerships, new tokenization offerings, developments regarding Ripple’s RLUSD, institutional partnerships, and possibly some information regarding the launch of Spot XRP ETFs in the US. “From stablecoins and payments to regulation and real-world adoption, Swell brings together the conversations shaping the future of finance,” noted Ripple in a social media post. Adding a new dimension to this year’s event is the confirmed participation of Patrick J. Witt, Executive Director of the Presidential Council of Advisors on Digital Assets (PCADA). Witt, who serves directly under the White House, will be making his first appearance at Ripple Swell, making this the first time in the event’s history that a sitting US government official has joined the speaker lineup since 2018. The inclusion of a White House voice at Swell 2025 upgrades the conference’s importance beyond the crypto community. It also shows the crypto-positive approach held by the current US administration.

Title: The Fed 5: Bessent's short list for Powell's job

EJ Antoni, chief economist at The Heritage Foundation, explains why the Fed has been behind the curve in managing monetary policy. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has whittled down his short list of candidates to replace Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell to five individuals, he said on Air Force One, The Wall Street Journal reported. Some have connections to the central bank and the White House, while another is a Wall Street powerhouse. President Donald Trump has kept up his verbal criticism of Powell for not cutting interest rates fast or deep enough, calling the chairman a "stubborn moron" and "Jerome Too Late Powell", among other things in social media posts and publicly. Bessent plans to brief Trump on the candidates in full after Thanksgiving, although Powell's term as chairman ends on May 15, 2026. FOX Business takes a look at the contenders ahead of the Federal Reserve’s October meeting on Wednesday in which policymakers are seen cutting interest rates by 25 basis points, lowering the target to a range of 3.75% to 4%. The anticipated rate cut follows the same move the Fed made at its September meeting. Markets also expect another rate cut of that size at the Fed's subsequent meeting in December. TRUMP SLAMS POWELL AS 'MORON' AND CALLS FOR FED'S BOARD TO TAKE CONTROL OF POLICY MOVES Here's the list in alphabetical order. Michelle Bowman was one of the first dissenters at the July meeting. (Graeme Sloan/Bloomberg/Getty Images / Getty Images) Federal Reserve Governor Bowman, who also serves as the Fed's vice chair for supervision, became one of the first dissenters at the July meeting, favoring rate cuts, while the central bank left rates unchanged. She has also made her case for future rates through year-end. Kevin Hassett is the director of the National Economic Council. (Allison Robbert/Bloomberg via Getty Images) Hassett is on his second spin through Trump's orbit. He is the director of the National Economic Council. In the first Trump administration, he was a senior advisor and chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers. Both agencies work in tandem with the White House on economic policies. Hassett said the latest consumer inflation data, which showed a less-than-expected 3% annual increase, is a sign costs are falling. "Our expectation is that inflation is decelerating and that will take all the pressure off the Fed to keep on the path that they are on," he said during an interview on FOX Business Network's "Varney & Co." FED EXPECTED RATE CUT COMES WITH OTHER DILEMMAS FOR CENTRAL BANK BlackRock Global Allocation Team Head Rick Rieder predicts the Fed's next moves on interest rates on 'The Claman Countdown.' Rick Rieder, BlackRock's chief investment officer of global fixed income, oversees $3.2 trillion in customer assets for the world's largest asset manager. BlackRock has more than $10 trillion under management. During an interview with FOX Business' Liz Claman in August, Reider was asked about being considered for the role. "When I first heard it, I thought it'd be the greatest honor of my life. I mean, to actually be considered in a position like that and think about the responsibility, and quite frankly, what I thought about is the ability, and I think why serving your country is such a powerful dynamic, is the ability to help people through monetary policy, through economic transmission, is really powerful," he said. CHEVRON CEO TOUTS AMERICA'S ENERGY COMEBACK Christopher Waller, (Al Drago/Bloomberg via Getty Images / Getty Images) Waller, like his colleague Bowman, was also among the dissenters in July. The duo signaled a growing divide within the Federal Reserve, which has come under fire for waiting too long to cut rates amid higher inflation and a slowing labor market. WALLER, BOWMAN EXPLAIN DISSENTS AMID FED PRESSURE Former Federal Reserve Board Gov. Kevin Warsh discusses the significance of ADP ending data sharing with the Federal Reserve and the return of inflation data on ‘Maria Bartiromo’s Wall Street.’ The former Federal Reserve governor, who was one of the early contenders for Fed chair, has been a longtime critic of the central bank. "I think their track record is really quite poor in forecasting the growth of the economy from policies like the ones the president put in place. And their inflation forecasts have been terrible, too. That's why they were so late, and that's why we had this surge of inflation that's done the most harm to the hardest-working Americans among us.
