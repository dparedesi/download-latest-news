Wall Street’s main indexes opened at record highs in anticipation of Trump’s pro-business approach. Donald Trump’s return as president of the United States for the second time has boosted equity markets on bets of lower corporate tax, favourable tariffs and deregulation, lifting shares of banks, locally focused small-cap companies and Trump Media. His promise to make Tesla CEO Elon Musk head of a government efficiency commission after the billionaire backed Trump throughout his electoral campaign led to a 12.5 percent surge in the shares of the electric carmaker. Wall Street’s main indexes opened at record highs, while the small-cap Russell 2000 index jumped about 4.8 percent to its highest in nearly three years. “Business animal spirits could be rekindled once again from Trump’s pro-business approach which could lead to a more robust capital expenditures and investment environment,” said Jeff Schulze, market strategist at ClearBridge Investments. Trump Media & Technology Group, in which Trump owns a majority stake rose nearly 8 percent in choppy trading. Investors overlooked the company’s latest quarterly results that showed the Truth Social parent’s revenue was just $1m. The shares have more than tripled in value from their all-time lows in late September, and Trump’s stake was worth as much as $5.3bn, up from $3.9bn on Tuesday. Trump’s Republican Party also secured the Senate and was making gains in the House of Representatives, potentially making it easier for the president to legislate his proposals and push through key appointments. Markets “have priced in a pretty strong mandate for the Republicans and are biasing towards most of the Trump trades”, said Scott Chronert, US equity strategist at Citi. “Policy details will be important for here as the market focus seems to be putting more emphasis on deregulation, tax cuts, and a more business-friendly backdrop.” Wall Street lenders JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Goldman Sachs jumped between 6 percent and 10 percent on prospects of improving domestic investment, looser regulations and more deals. “Trump’s win likely means some deregulation, including rolling back banking regulations, though Big Tech may remain a bipartisan antitrust focus,” strategists at BlackRock Investment Institute said in a note. Semiconductor stocks advanced, with the Philadelphia chip index rising 1.8 percent and AI darling Nvidia gaining 2.7 percent despite Trump’s criticism of the US CHIPS and Science Act, which supports domestic chip manufacturing through subsidies. Trump has instead proposed tariffs on imported chips, particularly from Taiwan’s TSMC, whose US-listed shares dropped 3 percent. Oil stocks firmed 3.5 percent, while US renewable energy companies such as NextEra Energy and First Solar plunged 6 percent and 13 percent, respectively. Trump’s campaign laid out an energy policy platform centred around maximising US fuel and power output, in part by dismantling the Biden administration’s efforts to fight climate change. While Tesla shares surged on Musk-Trump proximity, stocks of other electric carmakers dipped as Trump had said he would consider ending a $7,500 tax credit for EV purchases. Rivian Automotive dropped 8 percent and Nikola slipped about 1.4 percent. “Nobody is making money in EVs aside from Tesla, so the reduction or elimination of EV credits will widen Tesla’s competitive moat,” said Garrett Nelson, senior equity analyst at CFRA Research. Fears of escalation in Sino-US tensions pressured US-listed China shares with iShares MSCI China ETF dropping nearly 2.4 percent. Import duties, including a 10 percent universal tariff on imports from all foreign countries and a 60 percent tariff on imports from China, are a key plank of Trump’s policies and likely to have the biggest global impact. Victory for Trump, who has positioned himself as pro-cryptocurrency, lifted Bitcoin to a record high. Crypto-linked stocks Coinbase, MicroStrategy, Riot Platforms, MARA Holdings jumped between 11 percent and 21 percent. Private prison operators Geo Group and CoreCivic jumped about more than 30 percent each as Trump’s promised crack down on undocumented immigration could boost demand for detention centres. US steel makers Cleveland-Cliffs, Steel Dynamics and Nucor surged between 13 percent and 19 percent, with analysts having noted in the run-up to the election that a Trump presidency may mean rising protections for the domestic steel industry.

Title: BlackRock Bitcoin ETF trades over $1 billion in the first 20 minutes

Share this article BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) recorded over $1 billion in trading volume within the first 20 minutes of market opening on November 6, according to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. Damn, $IBIT has seen $1b in volume in the first 20min- that's about what it does in full day. Other bitcoin ETFs in same boat, crazy volume. Set for a record-breaking volume day (and given price is up so much, this is likely feeding frenzy volume vs crisis volume = look for… pic.twitter.com/1gSvV5Lwzo — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) November 6, 2024 At the time of writing, over $2.5 billion worth of IBIT shares traded hands, Coinglass data shows. Meanwhile, Fidelity’s FBTC saw around $464 million in volume, followed by Grayscale’s GBTC, per Coinglass. Trading volume, which represents both buying and selling activity, doesn’t directly translate to net inflows. For instance, of the $4.5 billion in first-day volume for Bitcoin ETFs, only about $600 million constituted actual inflows. Balchunas suggested that IBIT could end today with huge inflows. Historically, large volume spikes during a rally have often preceded significant inflows into Bitcoin ETFs, the analyst said. Remember the last time we saw volume spike during a rally? That was a precursor to the recent flow-athon, $IBIT alone took in $1.8b over next few days. Not saying it's guarantee but i'm fan of patterns and it fits pattern. https://t.co/YbkshZ5lOw — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) November 6, 2024 His projection was based on similar patterns observed on October 30, when IBIT’s trading volume surpassed $3.3 billion, which later converted into $643 million in net buying, Crypto Briefing reported. That marked the fund’s heaviest inflow since March 12 when Bitcoin neared $73,000. According to data tracked by Farside Investors, IBIT shed over $44 million yesterday. US spot Bitcoin ETFs also ended the day with approximately $117 million in net outflows, extending its losing streak to three consecutive days. The recent spike in IBIT trading comes amid Bitcoin’s price rally to around $74,400, up over 6% in the last 24 hours. Bitcoin recently established a new record high of $75,358 on CoinGecko. The milestone was achieved against the backdrop of the 2024 US elections, with projections indicating that Donald Trump was set to secure a second term in office. Trump’s victory was later confirmed as major media outlets, including FOX News, the Associated Press, and NBC, officially declared him the winner of the 2024 election.

Title: Garrett Motion Inc. (GTX): A Bull Case Theory

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We came across a bullish thesis on Garrett Motion Inc. (GTX) on Value Investing by Double Alpha Factory’s Substack by Maksim. In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on GTX. Garrett Motion Inc. (GTX)'s share was trading at $7.34 as of Nov 4th. GTX’s trailing and forward P/E were 6.02 and 5.95 respectively according to Yahoo Finance. A close up of an engine piston with a commercial turbocharger attached. Garrett Motion (GTX) operates as a key player in the mobility and industrial technology sector, focusing on high-performance turbocharging solutions for light vehicles, commercial vehicles, and industrial applications. Known for its mechanical and electrical turbo products, GTX caters to a broad spectrum of vehicle types, including gasoline, diesel, and natural gas engines, with some revenue now coming from its E-Boosting and hydrogen fuel cell compression solutions. As of 2023, GTX leads in turbochargers for internal combustion engines (ICEs), a critical technology that enables automakers to meet fuel efficiency and emission standards without sacrificing power or performance. This niche, heavily dominated by Garrett Motion and BorgWarner, has a high barrier to entry due to the technical complexity involved. Additionally, a significant portion of GTX's revenue is secured years in advance, with more than 80% of OEM sales planned four years ahead, providing solid visibility into future cash flows. Despite the auto industry's shift towards battery electric vehicles (BEVs), GTX’s turbo business remains resilient, with turbocharger penetration expected to exceed 50% in ICE-based vehicles through 2030. As BEV adoption has slowed due to infrastructure, cost, and consumer preference challenges, hybrids—where turbo penetration is even higher—are likely to account for a larger portion of future vehicles. This benefits GTX, as hybrids require more advanced turbo systems, which offer higher margins. Moreover, GTX’s commercial and industrial applications, such as backup power generators and marine engines, represent a significant growth area, accounting for about 30% of total sales and offering higher profitability than light vehicle applications. This segment continues to expand, especially in sectors like marine and backup power, where demand is surging due to their role in ensuring stable power for critical infrastructure, such as data centers. CEO commentary from recent earnings calls reflects GTX's confidence in the durability of its turbo business, which caters to both diesel and natural gas engines for high-demand applications like locomotives and off-highway vehicles. In terms of financials, GTX projects substantial free cash flow (FCF) generation over the next five years. Management estimates between $1.7 billion to $2.1 billion in FCF, with the lower end of this forecast still translating to a FCF yield of approximately 20% based on its current market capitalization of around $1.6-$1.7 billion. This robust FCF, along with GTX’s forward sales visibility, makes it likely that the company could repurchase its entire outstanding share base within five years, even after allocating around $0.5 billion toward new zero-emission technologies. Given the current 41% BEV penetration assumption in these projections—an aggressive forecast—GTX’s outlook could improve further if BEV adoption rates continue to lag. The slow pace of the BEV transition, noted at the 2024 J.P. Morgan Automotive Conference, reinforces the durability of GTX's revenue base, as the turbocharger market retains a long tail of demand. Recent discussions, including those from major industry events and political forums, highlight various challenges facing BEV adoption, such as prohibitive costs, consumer hesitancy, and infrastructure inadequacies. In Europe, for example, the ambitious goal to ban non-BEV vehicles by 2035 faces substantial resistance, with auto executives and government officials questioning the feasibility of such rapid changes. In the U.S., adoption rates for BEVs are likewise decelerating, as indicated by recent regulatory shifts to ease tailpipe standards. The Biden administration, for instance, reduced its BEV adoption targets amid political and industry feedback. Meanwhile, automakers are doubling down on hybrids, which offer a balance between emission reduction and operational efficiency. Companies like Ford and General Motors are pivoting to hybrids due to profitability concerns, reinforcing GTX’s position in the evolving vehicle mix. In China, EV manufacturers are increasingly exploring hybrid technologies, acknowledging the profitability and flexibility advantages of hybrid systems over pure BEVs. Garrett's sustained focus on hybrids and ICE solutions aligns well with these market shifts, positioning it as a critical supplier for automakers facing stringent efficiency mandates but limited by BEV scalability issues. From an investment perspective, Garrett Motion's (GTX) valuation is attractive, trading at a discount relative to its cash flow potential. With a market cap of approximately $1.6 to $1.7 billion, GTX is projected to generate $1.7 billion in free cash flow (FCF) over the next five years. This cash flow can be utilized for substantial stock buybacks, potentially enhancing shareholder value and driving the stock price higher. The company’s diverse revenue streams, particularly in expanding commercial and industrial applications, provide resilience amid uncertainties in the transition to battery electric vehicles (BEVs). In a worst-case scenario, investors can anticipate a 20% return over the next five years, followed by a 10% return in subsequent years, indicating a solid margin of safety. Comparatively, GTX's closest competitor, BorgWarner, trades at free cash flow yields of around 8-10%, about half of GTX’s yield. This difference implies a potential upside of 50-100% for GTX if the market aligns its valuation with that of BorgWarner. The investment thesis is based on GTX's strong market position, ongoing demand for internal combustion engines (ICE) and hybrid vehicles, clear revenue visibility, diversification into high-margin industrial applications, and robust free cash flow generation. Collectively, these factors underscore GTX's status as an undervalued entity with significant upside potential, particularly if the transition to BEVs is slower than anticipated. Garrett Motion Inc. (GTX) is not on our list of the 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 32 hedge fund portfolios held GTX at the end of the second quarter which was 35 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the risk and potential of GTX as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GTX but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Fundamentally Strong Penny Stocks to Invest In. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Luk Fook Holdings (International) Limited (OTC:LKFLF) stands against the other fundamentally strong penny stocks. As per Royce Investment Partners, small caps saw a rebound in Q3, exhibiting a strong advance on both an absolute and relative basis. As per the investment management firm, the Russell 2000 Index saw an increase of ~9.3% in Q3 2024, surpassing the large-cap Russell 1000 Index (which rose ~6.1%) and the mega-cap Russell Top 50 Index (which increased ~4.2%). The investment firm believes that small caps see a long road back to the top, with large caps holding a commanding lead through the initial 9 months of 2024. On a YTD basis, the Russell 2000 saw an increase of ~11.2% compared to the respective gains of ~21.2% and ~27.3% for the Russell 1000 and Russell Top 50, in the third quarter of 2024. The investment firm said a confluence of factors might support small-caps in sustaining market leadership. The still-growing US economy, together with a more typical interest rate environment, might support small-cap leadership. As per Russell Investments, the US equity-market leadership reversed during Q3 2024, with small-cap stocks surpassing the returns delivered by their large-cap counterparts. Also, the value factor outperformed the growth factor. This means there was a significant pivot from the first 2 quarters of 2024, during which market returns were dominated by the US large-cap growth stocks— the Magnificent 7, to be precise. Russell Investments highlighted that, from Q2 2024 to Q3 2024, there was a moderate change in the US average daily turnover, with $578.8 billion in Q3 2024 as compared to $581.5 billion in Q2 2024. Q3 2024 saw a shift in investor focus from high-flying tech stocks to more traditional sectors. Small-cap and value stocks surpassed the performance of large-cap and growth stocks, thanks to the broader market rotation. Moreover, utility stocks saw significant traction due to higher investments in energy infrastructure in a bid to support the elevated demand from AI and data centers.

Wall Street experts believe that the shifts in monetary policy, sectoral innovation and developments, a favorable interest rate environment, and supportive regulatory environment are expected to fuel growth in small and emerging stocks over the next year. As per Francis Gannon, Co-Chief Investment Officer, and Managing Director of Royce Investment Partners, earnings form the foundation for long-term performance. This means that earnings tend to support the broader market over the long term. He noted that the Russell 2000 saw a near-record number of companies having no earnings, with a total of ~44.6% (as of September end). Despite this, the earnings growth for the small-cap companies that have them has been estimated to be higher than large-cap ones in 2025. Chuck Royce, Founder and Senior Advisor at Royce Investment Partners, believes that the lower rates are expected to help the M&A activity. The potential buyers have been waiting for the US Fed to act before they go ahead with acquisitions. He believes that many small-caps want to get merged. Therefore, there are expectations of more strategic buyouts moving forward. Our Methodology To list the 10 Best Fundamentally Strong Penny Stocks to Invest In, we used Finviz and Yahoo screeners to extract stocks trading under $5. Next, we selected the companies that have reliable 3-year revenue and 3-year net income growth rates. Finally, the stocks were arranged in ascending order of their hedge fund holdings, as of Q2 2024.

Wall Street analysts believe that Luk Fook Holdings (International) Limited (OTC:LKFLF)’s growth prospects are expected to be aided by its asset-light model, which should enable the company to expand into lower-tier cities in China. The firm’s focus on affordable luxury and its strong network of licensed stores provide a healthy foundation for future growth. The analysts are optimistic about Luk Fook Holdings (International) Limited (OTC:LKFLF) as a result of its strong licensing model and healthy post-pandemic recovery. The company’s strategy revolves around the successful use of licensing, which led to the expansion of its brand reach across Mainland China and fortified Luk Fook Holdings (International) Limited (OTC:LKFLF)’s position in Hong Kong/Macau and several other international markets. The company continues to focus on cost efficiency and store optimization and remains well-placed to manage potential rental cost hikes. Luk Fook Holdings (International) Limited (OTC:LKFLF)’s successful reinvigoration of tourist sales and a lower gold hedging ratio should help it to capitalize on rising gold prices. The company highlighted that the decline in same-store sales in the Mainland market (which includes self-operated shops and licensed shops) and the Hong Kong market narrowed since September. From 1 October - 14 October 2024, its overall same-store sales performance demonstrated some improvements as compared to Q2. The mainland government continues to work on boosting domestic demand.

(NASDAQ:META) stands against other trending AI stocks on the latest analyst ratings and news. The AI Boom in Big Tech is showing no signs of slowing down any time soon. This past week, artificial intelligence was the key focus for the Big Five, which together are valued at more than $10 trillion. The reporting season not only highlighted the push these big tech companies are making in AI investments but also demonstrated that they aren’t afraid to take it up any further than they already have. Previously, concerns regarding the returns from substantial AI investments had led to negative investor sentiment and even triggered a sell-off in major AI plays. However, some results are demonstrating that AI investments may be worth the wait.

As long as that infrastructure continues to be built, then we continue to be in a good place for the broader AI trade”. That said, executives of the major AI plays have fair-warned that their AI splurges will continue next year. Tech giants are racing to secure high-end chips and build sprawling data centers, forging partnerships with energy providers and much more. Each company wants to prove to Wall Street that these investments will eventually lead to greater profitability as compared to their current businesses. Ray Wang, principal analyst and founder at Constellation Research, believes that only a handful of technology names will be able to come out at the top, especially considering the high costs related to AI. This makes the situation quite favorable for well-capitalized companies. As companies ramp up their spending on AI, let’s take a closer look at how other AI players are advancing to make headlines. For starters, Perplexity, an AI conversational search engine that uses large language models to answer queries, has announced a dedicated hub for US general election information. Even though the AI-powered search engine has been seen to hallucinate from time to time, the company is keen on showing its trustworthiness when it comes to tracking election results. “Starting Tuesday, we’ll be offering live updates on elections by leveraging data from The Associated Press so you can stay informed on presidential, senate, and house races at both a state and national level. Thank you to Democracy Works for granting us access to your Elections API to help power these experiences.” The company’s election hub provides answers to election-related questions, as well as AI-generated analyses on ballot measures, policy stances, candidates, and endorsements. In other news, Noma Security, a stealth mode startup specializing in Enterprise, Cyber Security, and Artificial Intelligence, is said to be developing tools to identify vulnerable data pipelines and code in data science environments, as well as threats like prompt injection attacks. “Existing tools are designed for the traditional software lifecycle. However, the data and AI lifecycle is inherently different. It involves distinct R&D processes, relies on different technologies, and faces unique technical vulnerabilities within AI models.” Talking about the AI pioneer OpenAI, reports from Bloomberg state that the company is in talks with California’s attorney general’s office about the process of becoming a for-profit entity. While a shift to being a for-profit company would mark a drastic reversal in the governance structure for the company, the move would also make the firm more attractive to investors.

Stephen Yiu, chief investment officer of Blue Whale Growth Fund, has similar views on the stock.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 15 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Dell Technologies Inc. (NYSE:DELL) stands against other trending AI stocks on the latest analyst ratings and news. The AI Boom in Big Tech is showing no signs of slowing down any time soon. This past week, artificial intelligence was the key focus for the Big Five, which together are valued at more than $10 trillion. The reporting season not only highlighted the push these big tech companies are making in AI investments but also demonstrated that they aren’t afraid to take it up any further than they already have. Previously, concerns regarding the returns from substantial AI investments had led to negative investor sentiment and even triggered a sell-off in major AI plays. However, some results are demonstrating that AI investments may be worth the wait. READ ALSO: Top 10 Trending AI Stocks to Watch in November and Top 10 Trending AI Stocks in Q4. “The AI theme is intact if you’re the mega caps,” as companies show that they can monetize their investments while maintaining existing profitability. As long as that infrastructure continues to be built, then we continue to be in a good place for the broader AI trade”. That said, executives of the major AI plays have fair-warned that their AI splurges will continue next year. Tech giants are racing to secure high-end chips and build sprawling data centers, forging partnerships with energy providers and much more. Each company wants to prove to Wall Street that these investments will eventually lead to greater profitability as compared to their current businesses. Ray Wang, principal analyst and founder at Constellation Research, believes that only a handful of technology names will be able to come out at the top, especially considering the high costs related to AI. This makes the situation quite favorable for well-capitalized companies. As companies ramp up their spending on AI, let’s take a closer look at how other AI players are advancing to make headlines. For starters, Perplexity, an AI conversational search engine that uses large language models to answer queries, has announced a dedicated hub for US general election information. Even though the AI-powered search engine has been seen to hallucinate from time to time, the company is keen on showing its trustworthiness when it comes to tracking election results. “Starting Tuesday, we’ll be offering live updates on elections by leveraging data from The Associated Press so you can stay informed on presidential, senate, and house races at both a state and national level. Thank you to Democracy Works for granting us access to your Elections API to help power these experiences.” The company’s election hub provides answers to election-related questions, as well as AI-generated analyses on ballot measures, policy stances, candidates, and endorsements. In other news, Noma Security, a stealth mode startup specializing in Enterprise, Cyber Security, and Artificial Intelligence, is said to be developing tools to identify vulnerable data pipelines and code in data science environments, as well as threats like prompt injection attacks. “Existing tools are designed for the traditional software lifecycle. However, the data and AI lifecycle is inherently different. It involves distinct R&D processes, relies on different technologies, and faces unique technical vulnerabilities within AI models.” Talking about the AI pioneer OpenAI, reports from Bloomberg state that the company is in talks with California’s attorney general’s office about the process of becoming a for-profit entity. While a shift to being a for-profit company would mark a drastic reversal in the governance structure for the company, the move would also make the firm more attractive to investors. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A team of IT experts discussing the latest network security trends over a laptop screen. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 88 Dell Technologies Inc. (NYSE:DELL) is an American multinational technology company that designs, develops, manufactures, markets, sells, and supports a wide range of comprehensive and integrated solutions, products, and services. The company offers the hardware and infrastructure that support the deployment and scalability of AI applications across various industries. On November 1, CRN reported that the Dell PowerMax and Dell PowerScale have gotten big AI upgrades. The newest upgrades to the PowerMax storage arrays give partners faster and more efficient input and output rates, three times faster connectivity through ethernet, and the ability to back up a petabyte worth of data per day. Moreover, it also introduces 92 percent RAID efficiency to optimize overall storage and industry-leading power and environmental monitoring capabilities. Varun Chhabra, senior vice president of product marketing at Dell Technologies, said the company has embedded AI into the product to make alerting easier, learn the customer’s workload, and then adjust its health checks and thresholds accordingly. “There’s no other vendor in the world that has the capabilities across storage, servers or storage, compute, networking, client, PCs, data protection, etc., etc., that Dell has. And as AI is deployed, and how AI is deployed, and where it’s deployed continues to evolve. We think this is going to be a big differentiator for our customers.” Overall, DELL ranks 6th on our list of trending AI stocks on the latest analyst ratings and news. While we acknowledge the potential of DELL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than DELL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: PAC free to investigate MAHB sale, says Transport Minister

Wednesday, 06 Nov 2024 KUALA LUMPUR: Transport Minister Anthony Loke said he has no qualms if the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) investigates the sale of Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd (MAHB) shares to a company linked to BlackRock. He said that the ministry, through the Malaysian Aviation Commission (Mavcom), is only focused on regulating competition in the industry. "If the PAC chairman Datuk Mas Ermieyati Samsudi wants, she may call for a meeting any time to review the deal's details. "Mavcom only looks into industry dealings from a regulatory perspective ... (and) has no say in its equity distribution. "Eventhough Mavcom is under the ministry's purview, I am not directly involved in its decision making as meetings are attended by its own board members, and the decisions they make are independent and objective based on their mandate to regulate the industry," Loke told Parliament during his ministry's winding down speech of Budget 2025 on Wednesday (Nov 6). Loke was responding to concerns raised by Mohd Radzi Md Jidin (PN-Putrajaya) over the sale of MAHB's shares to a foreign company, with the latter demanding why MAHB shares could not have been sold to local investors. This comes after Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), along with the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, planned to buy a 30% stake in MAHB's privatisation move. The deal was criticised by Opposition politicians after it emerged that GIP is in talks to be sold to BlackRock, a firm that is reported to have investments in Israel.

Title: Puttshack’s Technological Twist On Mini-Golf Hits 20 Locations
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikedojc/2024/11/06/puttshacks-technological-twist-on-mini-golf-hits-20-locations/
Time Published: 2024-11-06T12:29:34Z
Full Content:
The view inside a Puttshack location Putt-putt, an amusement partaken by seven-to-seventy-year-olds may conjure memories of analog-fun—ramps leading into clown mouths and windmills with blades guarding the path to the hole that your opponent would have to spin to get turning. But to younger generations, a digitally enhanced version is fast becoming par for the course. Puttshack, a fast-growing eatertainment name, has just opened the doors on its 20th location in Dunwoody, Georgia, their second venue in the Atlanta GTA. The high-tech concept which received a $150 million capital infusion from BlackRock two years-ago, ditches miniature pencils and scorecards for their proprietary Trackaball technology, where the ball itself keeps tabs on players’ strokes and tabulates scores. “It knows the difference between you hitting the ball, and the ball hitting features on the course and so much to my children’s chagrin, you can’t actually cheat in the game so it does take some elements out of the traditional mini golf I remember as a kid,” CEO Logan Powell explained. Unlike traditional golf where were the lower your tally the better, scoring is via a modified Stableford system of sorts, with points awarded for birdies, pars and hole-in-ones, yet also subtracted for rolling into a hazard. There’s almost a pinball dynamic at play, with “supertube” markers on each hole that if hit, gush up point totals, setting the stage for plenty of lead changes within a round, which is by design. Powell views the dynamic scoring system through the prism of competitive socializing and wanted to facilitate as many opportunities to turn a round, well around, as possible. “We wanted to make sure that if you want to make a comeback, it levels the playing field a little bit and I can tell you from experience that I can go from crushing it one round and play the same course and just do horribly. Having those fun innovations, which also build on themselves—if you hit multiple super tubes in a row you get extra bonus points—the game encourages you to build up streaks and really go after it,” Powell adds, that often at the wire, it’s still anybody’s game. Holes feature skateboard style half pipes, a take on Connect Four, a tribute to beer pong and a basketball hole where a robot defender attempts to prevent balls from dunking.Its fair to say that their philosophy on hole design, is to keep the creative wheels turning. “We have a phenomenal innovation team based out of the U.K. who design all of our holes and we have new ones we’re developing now. We wanted to take the fun, nostalgic aspects of mini golf that you would think of from playing the traditional game but elevate it to target the demographic that tends to come to our stores—the 21-39 year old crowd,” Powell said, adding that they like elements to be recognizable but then to add a technology twist. Less than a year ago, they introduced the Challenge Hole, a private mini-golf suite where couples and small groups could eat-drink-play in a single location while playing a variety of putting themed games including a spin on Nintendo’s Duck Hunt, the point and shoot classic currently celebrating its 40th anniversary. “The ducks go across a screen and there are slots to put the the ball into and you’re trying to hit the ducks,” Powell explained, adding that reserving the Challenge Hole is popular for date nights. Addison, Texas is the beta test for the product and they plan to offer it as well in future locations, though a decision to retrofit existing locations to include one is still being considered. Puttshack’s main differentiating factor from other eatertainment concepts facilitating flatstick fun is how much it leans into technology. Though you find scorecards either at Puttery, which uses touchscreens to keep score or Tiger Woods’ Popstroke where an app is used to keep tallies and order food and drinks. The new Dunwoody location in Northern Atlanta, typifies the type of real estate sweet spots they scout for in order to hit their demographic trifecta—families, the corporate crowd and adults seeking an evening entertainment option. Domestically, locations average an ample 25,000 square feet and include dedicated private event space which get a lot of use over the holidays. “We typically target more urban locations, those hotspot areas within a market where you or your friends would think about going. When we think about a Puttshack location, it needs to be in an area where people tend to work, live, and play. We want to make sure we are in the consideration mix there,” Powell said. A group dining at a Puttshack location Beyond the mini-golf experience, the apps at Puttshack are as international as a Presidents Cup squad, offering shareables that range from Lebanese hummus and Korean bao buns to Thai fried chicken and Canadian-style poutine. Every location even has its own take on spring rolls—dubbed ‘tailpipes’—tailored to the local market. The Atlanta area locations feature fire-braised chicken, collard greens, and pimento cheese, served with BBQ and peach dipping sauces. Puttshack also gives back through its menu, with $1 of each tailpipe purchase supporting area charities. Their Boston location donates to the New England Center for Children, while the newly opened Dunwoody site supports Lost-n-Found, a local nonprofit that provides services to homeless LGBTQ+ youth. Powell expects the demand for experiential entertainment with friends, family and loved ones outside the home will continue to grow and welcomes new concepts pile into the space. “I think winners within the space will tend to have a technological competitive edge and that’s why we continue to innovate and make sure we have fresh ideas.” With only 20 units, Powell feels Puttshack is still merely scratching the surface in terms of expanding their footprint. On the near horizon, they have new stores in various stages of completion in the Minneapolis, Chicago and Fort Lauderdale areas and see plenty of opportunity to continue to expand in markets they already have a presence in, as they’ve done in Atlanta.

Title: Trump Media, Tesla, and crypto stocks surge as Trump wins — and clean energy companies tumble

Donald Trump's victory in the presidential election boosted shares of his social media company, Elon Musk's Tesla, as well as cryptocurrencies and related stocks on Wednesday. The former president's reelection sent renewable-energy stocks tumbling in premarket trading as traders bet his administration would be less friendly in terms of subsidies and regulation. Shares of Trump Media & Technology Group surged as much as 62% to $55 as investors wagered Truth Social's parent company, which counts Trump as its largest shareholder, would benefit from his second term. The stock — which has Trump's initials, DJT, as its ticker — was trading 33% higher at last check. If the gain holds, Trump would be about $1.3 billion richer on paper given his near-53% stake in the company. Tesla stock rose as much as 15% in premarket trading and was poised to open at its highest level in more than a year. Musk, the electric-vehicle maker's CEO, has emerged as one of Trump's most vocal champions and closest advisors. If Tesla's overnight gain holds, Musk — already the world's richest person — would become $14 billion richer based on his roughly 13% stake. Bitcoin, the most popular crypto, climbed past $75,000 for the first time on election night before paring gains. Other digital coins including ethereum also jumped. Crypto stocks jumped on the prospect of a friendlier US regulatory environment under Trump. Coinbase and MicroStrategy both rose 13% ahead of the open. Conventional financial stocks also gained with Bank of America, JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, BlackRock, Blackstone, and KKR rising between 6% and 9% in the US premarket. Traders expect Wall Street banks, asset managers, and private equity firms to benefit from tax cuts and deregulation under Trump. In contrast, clean-energy stocks slid with Plug Power, SunRun, First Solar, and Enphase Energy all dropping at least 10% in premarket trading. Danish wind turbine manufacturer Orsted and rival Vestas fell 10% and 8% respectively in Frankfurt trading. The declines likely reflect concerns that Trump's reelection will lead to the repeal of the Inflation Reduction Act passed by the Biden administration, which provided large-scale tax credits for renewable-energy providers. The broader stock market gained before the open with futures underlying the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average climbing more than 2.3%, while Nasdaq 100 futures rose 1.8%.

Title: Bitcoin Hits Record as Pro-Crypto Trump Heads Toward US Victory

(Bloomberg) -- Bitcoin jumped to a record high, part of a wave of trades across global markets in response to Donald Trump emerging victorious over Democratic rival Kamala Harris in the US presidential election. Most Read from Bloomberg Paris Restricts Through Traffic in City Center Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races Highlight Views on Abortion, Immigration From Housing to Immigration, Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races to Follow The largest digital asset rose as much as 10% to $76,106 with Trump winning a second term, the Republicans taking back the Senate and the House looking increasingly more likely to remain red. The increase was the most since the last peak in March, when investors were cheered by inflows into US Bitcoin exchange-traded funds. Bitcoin is viewed by many as a so-called Trump trade because the former president embraced digital assets during his campaign after a major push by the industry. Crypto muscled onto the high table of politics by deploying a giant campaign-finance war chest to further its agenda. Trump vowed to make the US the crypto capital of the planet, create a strategic Bitcoin stockpile and appoint regulators who love digital assets. Harris adopted a more measured approach, pledging to support a regulatory framework for the industry. In contrast, the Securities & Exchange Commission under the Biden administration pursued a crackdown via a flurry of enforcement actions. “The crypto industry feels like it’s been operating with one hand tied behind its back for years, and it senses that might be coming to an end,” said Matthew Hougan, chief investment officer of Bitwise Asset Management Inc. “People are starting to position for the next few years in crypto.” In Ohio, Republican car dealer and blockchain entrepreneur Bernie Moreno beat Senate Banking Chairman Sherrod Brown. Crypto titans spent some $40 million to defeat Brown — a longtime skeptic of the industry — underlining the influence of their political outlays. The prospect of friendlier US crypto rules led to gains across the digital-asset market. Second-ranked token Ether added about 12%. Dogecoin, a meme-crowd favorite promoted by Trump supporter Elon Musk, rallied 31% at one point. Gensler’s Fate Digital-asset companies often complained that officials under President Joe Biden failed to create a clear new legal framework for the nascent market. SEC Chair Gary Gensler said existing rules apply and repeatedly labeled the sector as rife with fraud and misconduct. The agency cracked down on crypto following a 2022 market rout that triggered a litany of collapses, notably the bankruptcy of Sam Bankman-Fried’s fraudulent FTX exchange. “The first test of his credibility to watch out for is whether he will deliver on his promise to fire Gensler on his first day in office,” said Le Shi, Hong Kong managing director at market making firm Auros. Bitcoin has now advanced more than 80% in 2024, topping assets such as stocks and gold. US spot-Bitcoin ETFs, from issuers such as BlackRock Inc. and Fidelity Investments, have attracted $23.5 billion of net inflows following their launch at the start of the year — among the most successful new ETFs in history. --With assistance from Teresa Xie and Dave Liedtka.

Title: Bitcoin – Volatility reigns as election uncertainty spurs $541M in BTC ETF outflows

Could the inflows into BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF indicate a broader shift in investor sentiment towards Bitcoin ETFs? With the U.S Presidential election around the corner, the crypto market has seen a surge in volatility. Bitcoin [BTC] exchange-traded funds (ETFs), in particular, have felt the impact, with notable outflows observed on 1st and 4th November. With Election Day now here, uncertainty surrounding potential political shifts is continuing to add to the ups and downs of the Bitcoin ETF landscape. According to the latest data from Farside Investors on 4 November, Bitcoin ETFs recorded significant outflows – Totaling $541.1 million. Fidelity’s FBTC led the trend, with outflows hitting $169.6 million, followed closely by Ark 21Shares’ ARKB which saw $138.3 million in outflows. Grayscale’s BTC and Bitwise’s BITB also faced declines, with outflows of $89.5 million and $79.8 million, respectively. Grayscale’s GBTC recorded $63.7 million outflows too. Although most ETFs reported outflows, Invesco’s BTCO and WisdomTree’s BTCW stood out by maintaining stable flows without any outflows. Despite the broader downturn, however, not all updates were negative. BlackRock’s IBIT notably bucked the trend by attracting $38.4 million in inflows. Reflecting this optimism within the crypto community, Dr. Dinero shared a positive perspective, highlighting hopeful sentiment despite recent market turbulence. Source: Dr. Dinero/X Another X user noted, Source: Flip/X Looking at the cumulative data though, BTC ETFs have generated significant inflows since their launch, with volumes of $23 billion. Notably, BlackRock’s IBIT alone recorded $26 billion in inflows. Eric Balchunas, Bloomberg’s Senior ETF analyst, had previously forecasted that BTC ETFs might soon exceed the holdings attributed to Bitcoin’s creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. It was expected that these ETFs will reach this milestone by mid-December. However, a recent single-day purchase by BlackRock, totaling 12,127 BTC, has accelerated this timeline. In response to this significant accumulation, Balchunas shared his insights on X. He highlighted the swift momentum ETFs have gained in Bitcoin’s space. “At this rate, they’ll pass Satoshi in less than two weeks. Altho they can’t keep up this Joey Chestnut-level pace, can they?” This recent surge in Bitcoin ETF activity has coincided with notable price volatility in BTC itself. After touching $73,000 just days ago, Bitcoin has now dipped below the $70,000-threshold. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $68,807.31, following a slight 0.10% drop over the last 24 hours. On the weekly charts, it fell by over 3%. Thus, as election season adds an extra layer of uncertainty, the crypto market might be gearing up for further volatility in the coming days.

Click to read more Swiggy, the Indian food delivery giant, recently raised $605 million by selling shares to institutional investors, including well-known names like Fidelity and Norges Bank. This funding move marks a significant step as Swiggy prepares for a $1.35 billion initial public offering (IPO), expected to be India’s second-largest IPO this year. The share sale reflects strong institutional interest in Swiggy’s stock, underscoring confidence in the company’s growth potential and market position. In addition to Fidelity and Norges, domestic mutual funds have also shown keen interest in Swiggy’s offering, collectively purchasing shares worth $246 million, as noted in a stock exchange filing by Swiggy.

Combined with its rich valuation, this could make retail investors wary — similar to how they reacted to Hyundai Motor India’s recent debut. Still, foreign investors are likely to be big buyers, given their optimism about India’s long-term consumption growth, even if Swiggy’s shares don’t come cheap.

Swiggy’s innovation DNA is key to success and it could again be at the forefront through its new 10-minute food delivery offering. However, given that the company is still loss making at an aggregate level, and overall profitability may be some time away, we recommend only High Risk investors to ‘Subscribe for long term’. At the upper price band of ₹390, the issue is priced at 7.8x FY24 Market Cap to Sales and looks reasonably priced compared to Zomato which is trading at 17.5x.” Swiggy plans to utilise the IPO proceeds towards funding investment in the Material Subsidiary, Scootsy, investment in technology and cloud infrastructure, brand marketing and business promotion expenses for enhancing the brand awareness and visibility of its platform, across segments; and for funding inorganic growth through unidentified acquisitions and general corporate purposes.

Click to read more Swiggy, the Indian food delivery giant, recently raised $605 million by selling shares to institutional investors, including well-known names like Fidelity and Norges Bank. This funding move marks a significant step as Swiggy prepares for a $1.35 billion initial public offering (IPO), expected to be India’s second-largest IPO this year. The share sale reflects strong institutional interest in Swiggy’s stock, underscoring confidence in the company’s growth potential and market position. In addition to Fidelity and Norges, domestic mutual funds have also shown keen interest in Swiggy’s offering, collectively purchasing shares worth $246 million, as noted in a stock exchange filing by Swiggy. This local support from mutual funds further strengthens Swiggy’s financial backing as it moves toward its IPO, which has generated widespread anticipation in India’s financial markets. Swiggy Limited has emerged as a key player in India’s burgeoning on-demand delivery landscape. Its user-friendly app connects millions with a diverse range of services, extending far beyond food delivery to encompass groceries and logistics. Focused on innovation and convenience, Swiggy has solidified its presence, particularly in urban centres across the nation. This IPO will feature a total issue size of ₹11,327.43 crores, comprising a fresh issue of ₹4,499 crores and an offer for sale of ₹6,828.43 crores, inviting investors to partake in its growth story. Inputs from PTI report “At the upper price band of ₹390, Swiggy is available at Mcap/sales of 7.8x (on FY24 financials), which appears to be fairly priced. We assign a “Subscribe” rating for the issue on a long term investment basis, considering its strong brand recall, diversified offerings, integrated app, rapid scaling, consistent innovation, expansion of dark stores, and promising industry outlook.” QIB - NIL NII - NIL RIIs 0- 0.04 times Employee Reserved - 0.02 times Total: 0.01 times Indications from the grey market point to a muted listing-day gain for Swiggy. Combined with its rich valuation, this could make retail investors wary — similar to how they reacted to Hyundai Motor India’s recent debut. Still, foreign investors are likely to be big buyers, given their optimism about India’s long-term consumption growth, even if Swiggy’s shares don’t come cheap. Bloomberg report Track bl’s stock market live updates here Screenshot 2024-11-06 095124.png “Swiggy operates in a oligopoly market which is at a nascent stage, thus providing enough opportunities for players to create their niche. Swiggy’s innovation DNA is key to success and it could again be at the forefront through its new 10-minute food delivery offering. However, given that the company is still loss making at an aggregate level, and overall profitability may be some time away, we recommend only High Risk investors to ‘Subscribe for long term’. At the upper price band of ₹390, the issue is priced at 7.8x FY24 Market Cap to Sales and looks reasonably priced compared to Zomato which is trading at 17.5x.” Swiggy plans to utilise the IPO proceeds towards funding investment in the Material Subsidiary, Scootsy, investment in technology and cloud infrastructure, brand marketing and business promotion expenses for enhancing the brand awareness and visibility of its platform, across segments; and for funding inorganic growth through unidentified acquisitions and general corporate purposes. Up to 75 per cent of issue is reserved for qualified institutional bidders, 15 per cent for non-institutional investors (HNIs) and 10 per cent for retail investors. The company has also reserved 750,000 shares for employees, which will get a discount of ₹25 from the issue price.

The world's largest crypto rose to $74,504 on the day, beating its previous March all-time high of $73,780, CoinGecko data shows. Bitcoin is now up more than 9% over the last 24 hours. It has more than doubled in price in the last 12 months. It comes amid the U.S. election results between former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris, with the former gaining an early lead in electoral college votes. Trump or Harris need 270 electoral college votes to secure the presidency. Trump leads with 198 to Harris' 99, according to the latest figures from the Associated Press. Analysts have been citing a "Trump trade" is in play, which, they say, has helped bolster risk assets, including equities and crypto. The business mogul and former reality TV star has explicitly said he will help the digital asset industry, while Democratic candidate Kamala Harris has been quieter on the issue. Trump's renewed shot at claiming a second term in the White House has been keenly felt around the crypto industry, according to VanEck’s head of digital assets research, Matthew Sigel. "Trump has made material inroads in the last month," he told Decrypt before election day. "Many business leaders are all making phone calls to Donald Trump to mend fences." "There’s definitely some momentum for Trump, in my opinion," Sigel added. Previously with Bitcoin cycles, the crypto has hit highs following the asset's quadrennial halving event. This time, it's different, though, and the crypto last hit an all-time high in March, just ahead of April's halving. Bitcoin's halving happens every four years and cuts miner rewards in half, forcing those who secure the network to work harder and allowing fewer digital coins to be minted and put into circulation. But Bitcoin's spike earlier this year arguably comes down to the approval of Bitcoin ETFs. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in January approved 10 of the vehicles, which make it easy for people to buy shares that track the price of Bitcoin and trade on stock exchanges. A flood of capital has since entered the space, as traditional investors, previously too cautious about buying the asset, can now do so easily via products by Wall Street titans such as BlackRock and Fidelity. Such funds have seen more than $20 billion worth of inflows so far this year.

Title: ‘I was lucky to be there’ – No hard feelings as Garry Ringrose looks back on his first All Black experience

Garry Ringrose: 'I certainly feel if I’m not all-in in everything I can do to try and prepare, they are exceptionally good at exposing that.' Photo: Sportsfile Garry Ringrose had the best seat in the house as he watched history unfold at Solider Field in November 2016. Like Joey Carbery, Ringrose was named in an Ireland match-day squad for the first time, but rather than follow his former Blackrock College team-mate in helping to see out the historic victory over the All Blacks, he remained on the bench for the entire 80 minutes. Scrum-half Kieran Marmion found himself in a similar position in Chicago that day, but even looking back on it now, eight years later, there was no sense of bitterness on Ringrose’s part at missing out on such a momentous occasion. Instead, Joe Schmidt handed the centre his Test debut at home the following week in the slightly less glamorous win over Canada. “It was funny, I was 21,” Ringrose recalled. “Myself and Joey Carbery were on the bench and both of us would have been nervous going into the game. “I was lucky to be on the plane because Keith Earls got injured during the week and that gave me the opportunity to be on the bench. “I couldn’t believe that I’d been selected. After the game I had a text or two saying hard luck that I hadn’t got on but I was laughing to myself because that didn’t even cross my mind. “To be there for such a special occasion, I felt I was lucky to be over there. “Even the fact that Joey came on and played so well, I was coat-tailing on how well he had done because we had gone through the week together. “It wouldn’t have been a thing, any sort of frustration. I was just excited to be there and experience such a monumental day in Irish sports history, I think. Since then, I guess I’ve been lucky to play in the ones here. “There was one game, the autumn after the Lions tour when Robbie [Henshaw] and Bundee [Aki] would have been together [up until then] and Robbie was injured which gave me the opportunity to play and get the win on a special night in the Aviva. “Experiences like that stand out and you never take them for granted, to be lucky enough to beat such an exceptional side. It’ll take everything this week to try and repeat that.” As for what Schmidt said to Ringrose after keeping him on the bench against the All Blacks, given it is a rarity in modern-day rugby not to use all eight available replacements, Ringrose added: “I can’t remember exactly but I do remember after the game in the hotel, obviously everyone was celebrating, he let me know, just a heads-up, you’re going to be starting next week against Canada. “I was pretty nervous from that point on. I wouldn’t have expected or looked for an apology at all. Everyone was buzzing, it wasn’t even a thing.” Ringrose is set to be in the thick of the action against New Zealand at the Aviva Stadium on Friday night, as Ireland aim to finish a year, which has included a Six Nations title win and a Test victory in South Africa, on a high. “When I was younger in the first couple of squads you have the blinkers on, but in the last couple of years I’ve been able to look at it from the wider lens and appreciate the amount of support we have or that I can see around the country,” Ringrose (29) maintained. “And I don’t know what it is, there just seems to be a buzz about it, definitely in the World Cup. “I know my first World Cup was in Japan so it was unbelievable travelling support, but going through a World Cup that was a little bit closer to home and seeing and feeling the support was unbelievable. “And then there’s a continuation from there, I’ve certainly felt.” Ringrose’s battle with his opposite number Rieko Ioane, who may face a frosty reception from the Dublin crowd following his war of words with Johnny Sexton, is set to be one of many box-office match-ups. “I certainly feel if I’m not all-in in everything I can do to try and prepare, they are exceptionally good at exposing that,” Ringrose added. “And in the past it shows that even when we are all-in [with our] preparation, they can still expose it with the strength they have. “They’re a team you just have to be at your best against to try to beat them. And we’ve been lucky in the past in some of those seven games to get a win and then some unfortunate results in there as well. “It’s something I never take for granted, and I’m excited for the challenge. “I guess from my experience over the last couple of years, games can fall on such fine margins and against a team of their quality, even more so. “[It will be] unbelievably special and everyone in the group would be grateful to get an opportunity to play, to deliver for the support that will be there and the support that will be watching on TV. We’re just trying to do our best to prepare as best as we possibly can.”

Title: Why Professional Investors Often Misjudge the Market After a Presidential Election

Professional investors often assume they are free of political bias. However, research suggests this is far from true. Political bias is proven to cost investors who may over- or under-estimate the state of the economy depending on whether their preferred party is in power. Thank you for signing up!

You can opt out anytime. In a June Nasdaq article, investor Martin Tiller observed how many left-leaning investors dumped stocks after Donald Trump’s victory in 2016 and right-leaning investors after Barack Obama’s victory in 2008. Both were motivated by notions that the wrong party had won the election and the economy would pay a price. Yet, the S&P 500 consistently grew in the months following each president’s inauguration, duping the investors who let their bias get in the way. Academic research suggests this is a widespread phenomenon. A 2017 Journal of Financial Markets study highlighted how individuals’ investment behaviors shifted when their preferred political party held the White House. The study found that when their favored party was in power, investors became more optimistic, perceived markets as less risky, and increased allocations to high-beta, small-cap, and value stocks. Consequently, nonpartisan investors consistently outperformed their Democratic- and Republican-leaning counterparts, according to a University of Chicago study of fund performance from 2015 to 2021. Political bias affects not only market perspectives but also stock selection. Mutual fund managers often hold onto losing stocks issued by politically allied companies longer than justified, a behavioral pattern known as the “disposition effect,” according to a study by the University of Kansas of nearly 1,300 actively managed mutual funds between 2000 and 2015. In other words, fund managers may overestimate the competence of companies led by executives with similar political beliefs to theirs. The researchers found that funds with more politically-motivated stock selection have lower return-to-risk ratios. Political bias isn’t confined to equity investors. A 2020 study tracking credit analysts from Fitch, Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s between 2000 and 2018 showed that those not aligned with the sitting president’s party tended to issue more frequent downgrades of corporate credit ratings. Nevertheless, historical market data provides a stark reality check. Long-term market performance has proven resilient regardless of which political party holds power. The S&P 500, for example, has typically risen regardless of partisan shifts in Washington. While executive decisions from the White House can be large in scope and have long-term impact, markets can often work through them. For example, when Trump launched a trade war with China in September 2019, some analysts expected Apple (AAPL)’s iPhone sales to fall by as much as 8 million units and its share price to plummet. In the following 12 months, Apple’s stock rose 160 percent compared to the S&P 500’s 16 percent. Likewise, after President Joe Biden’s inauguration, many expected his green energy policies would hurt oil and natural gas companies. And yet, Morningstar’s data finds U.S. energy companies outperformed the S&P 500 in the year following. Political sentiments can also influence how major shareholders vote on corporate policies. Major mutual funds and asset managers tend to vote in lockstep with the political party in control at the time, according to joint research from the City University of Hong Kong and INSEAD published in the International Banker. Examining shareholder voting behavior between 2004 and 2021, the researchers found major asset managers were substantially more likely to support environmental and social initiatives when a Democrat was in the White House than when a Republican was. However, instead of bias getting in the way, another possible explanation is that major asset managers, like BlackRock (BLK), StateStreet and Vanguard, may be acting in accordance with the prevailing political party to avoid regulatory scrutiny. Further solidifying their findings, the researchers noted that voting behavior on corporate policies unrelated to environmental and social justice issues remained consistent, regardless of which political party was in power. Data confirms that the stock market reflects investors’ election jitters. VIX, an index measuring volatility in the stock market, is about 6 percent higher during election years than in other years. A higher VIX reading signals increased expected volatility and heightened market uncertainty from investors. We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience.

Title: X Is a White-Supremacist Site
URL: https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2024/11/x-white-supremacist-site/680538/
Time Published: 2024-11-05T19:41:17Z
Full Content:
Donald Trump has won the 2024 U.S. presidential election. Read more from our writers on what happens next: Elon Musk has made one of Twitter’s most glaring problems into a core feature on X. Produced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (NOA) using AI narration. X has always had a Nazi problem. I’ve covered the site, formerly known as Twitter, for more than a decade and reported extensively on its harassment problems, its verification (and then de-verification) of a white nationalist, and the glut of anti-Semitic hatred that roiled the platform in 2016. But something is different today. Heaps of unfiltered posts that plainly celebrate racism, anti-Semitism, and outright Nazism are easily accessible and possibly even promoted by the site’s algorithms. All the while, Elon Musk—a far-right activist and the site’s owner, who is campaigning for and giving away millions to help elect Donald Trump—amplifies horrendous conspiracy theories about voter fraud, migrants run amok, and the idea that Jewish people hate white people. Twitter was always bad if you knew where to look, but because of Musk, X is far worse. (X and Musk did not respond to requests for comment for this article.) It takes little effort to find neo-Nazi accounts that have built up substantial audiences on X. “Thank you all for 7K,” one white-nationalist meme account posted on October 17, complete with a heil-Hitler emoji reference. One week later, the account, which mostly posts old clips of Hitler speeches and content about how “Hitler was right,” celebrated 14,000 followers. One post, a black-and-white video of Nazis goose-stepping, has more than 187,000 views. Another racist and anti-Semitic video about Jewish women and Black men—clearly AI-generated—has more than 306,000 views. It was also posted in late October. Many who remain on the platform have noticed X decaying even more than usual in recent months. “I’ve seen SO many seemingly unironic posts like this on Twitter recently this is getting insane,” one X user posted in response to a meme that the far-right influencer Stew Peters recently shared. It showed an image of Adolf Hitler holding a telephone with overlaid text reading, “Hello … 2024? Are you guys starting to get it yet?” Peters appended the commentary, “Yes. We’ve noticed.” The idea is simply that Hitler was right, and X users ate it up: As of this writing, the post has received about 67,000 likes, 10,000 reposts, and 11.4 million views. When Musk took over, in 2022, there were initial reports that hate speech (anti-Black and anti-Semitic slurs) was surging on the platform. By December of that year, one research group described the increase in hate speech as “unprecedented.” And it seems to only have gotten worse. There are far more blatant examples of racism now, even compared with a year ago. In September, the World Bank halted advertising on X after its promoted ads were showing up in the replies to pro-Nazi and white-nationalist content from accounts with hundreds of thousands of followers. Search queries such as Hitler was right return posts with tens of thousands of views—they’re indistinguishable from the poison once relegated to the worst sites on the internet, including 4chan, Gab, and Stormfront. The hatred isn’t just coming from anonymous fringe posters either. Late last month, Clay Higgins, a Republican congressman from Louisiana, published a racist, threatening post about the Haitians in Springfield, Ohio, saying they’re from the “nastiest country in the western hemisphere.” Then he issued an ultimatum: “All these thugs better get their mind right and their ass out of our country before January 20th,” he wrote in the post, referencing Inauguration Day. Higgins eventually deleted the post at the request of his House colleagues on both sides of the aisle but refused to apologize. “I can put up another controversial post tomorrow if you want me to. I mean, we do have freedom of speech. I’ll say what I want,” he told CNN later that day. And although Higgins did eventually try to walk his initial post back, clarifying that he was really referring to Haitian gangs, the sentiment he shared with CNN is right. The lawmaker can put up another vile post maligning an entire country whenever he desires. Not because of his right to free speech—which exists to protect against government interference—but because of how Musk chooses to operate his platform. Despite the social network’s policy that prohibits “incitement of harassment,” X seemingly took no issue with Higgins’s racist post or its potential to cause real-world harm for Springfield residents. (The town has already closed and evacuated its schools twice because of bomb threats.) And why would X care? The platform, which reinstated thousands of banned accounts following Musk’s takeover, in 2022—accounts that belong to QAnon supporters, political hucksters, conspiracy theorists, and at least one bona fide neo-Nazi—is so inundated with bigoted memes, racist AI slop, and unspeakable slurs that Higgins’s post seemed almost measured by comparison. In the past, when Twitter seemed more interested in enforcing content-moderation standards, the lawmaker’s comments may have resulted in a ban or some other disciplinary response: On X, he found an eager, sympathetic audience willing to amplify his hateful message. His deleted post is instructive, though, as a way to measure the degradation of X under Musk. The site is a political project run by a politically radicalized centibillionaire. The worthwhile parts of Twitter (real-time news, sports, culture, silly memes, spontaneous encounters with celebrity accounts) have been drowned out by hateful garbage. X is no longer a social-media site with a white-supremacy problem, but a white-supremacist site with a social-media problem. Musk has certainly bent the social network to support his politics, which has recently involved joking on Tucker Carlson’s show (which streams on X) that “nobody is even bothering to try to kill Kamala” and repurposing the @america handle from an inactive user to turn it into a megaphone for his pro-Trump super PAC. Musk has also quite clearly reengineered the site so that users see him, and his tweets, whether or not they follow him. When Musk announced his intent to purchase Twitter, in April 2022, the New York Times columnist Ezra Klein aptly noted that “Musk reveals what he wants Twitter to be by how he acts on it.” By this logic, it would seem that X is vying to be the official propaganda outlet not just for Trump generally but also for the “Great Replacement” theory, which states that there is a global plot to eradicate the white race and its culture through immigration. In just the past year, Musk has endorsed multiple posts about the conspiracy theory. In November 2023, in response to a user named @breakingbaht who accused Jews of supporting bringing “hordes of minorities” into the United States, Musk replied, “You have said the actual truth.” Musk’s post was viewed more than 8 million times. Read: Musk’s Twitter is the blueprint for a MAGA government Though Musk has publicly claimed that he doesn’t “subscribe” to the “Great Replacement” theory, he appears obsessed with the idea that Republican voters in America are under attack from immigrants. Last December, he posted a misleading graph suggesting that the number of immigrants arriving illegally was overtaking domestic birth rates. He has repeatedly referenced a supposed Democratic plot to “legalize vast numbers of illegals” and put an end to fair elections. He has falsely suggested that the Biden administration was “flying ‘asylum seekers’, who are fast-tracked to citizenship, directly into swing states like Pennsylvania, Ohio, Wisconsin and Arizona” and argued that, soon, “everywhere in America will be like the nightmare that is downtown San Francisco.” According to a recent Bloomberg analysis of 53,000 of Musk’s posts, the billionaire has posted more about immigration and voter fraud than any other topic (more than 1,300 posts in total), garnering roughly 10 billion views. But Musk’s interests extend beyond the United States. This summer, during a period of unrest and rioting in the United Kingdom over a mass stabbing that killed three children, the centibillionaire used his account to suggest that a civil war there was “inevitable.” He also shared (and subsequently deleted) a conspiracy theory that the U.K. government was building detainment camps for people rioting against Muslims. Additionally, X was instrumental in spreading misinformation and fueling outrage among far-right, anti-immigration protesters. In Springfield, Ohio, X played a similar role as a conduit for white supremacists and far-right extremists to fuel real-world harm. One of the groups taking credit for singling out Springfield’s Haitian community was Blood Tribe, a neo-Nazi group known for marching through city streets waving swastikas. Blood Tribe had been focused on the town for months, but not until prominent X accounts (including Musk’s, J. D. Vance’s, and Trump’s) seized on a Facebook post from the region did Springfield become a national target. “It is no coincidence that there was an online rumor mill ready to amplify any social media posts about Springfield because Blood Tribe has been targeting the town in an effort to stoke racial resentment against ‘subhuman’ Haitians,” the journalist Robert Tracinski wrote recently. Tracinski argues that social-media channels (like X) have been instrumental in transferring neo-Nazi propaganda into the public consciousness—all the way to the presidential-debate stage. He is right. Musk’s platform has become a political tool for stoking racial hatred online and translating it into harassment in the physical world. The ability to drag fringe ideas and theories into mainstream political discourse has long been a hallmark of X, even back when it was known as Twitter. There’s always been a trade-off with the platform’s ability to narrow the distance between activists and people in positions of power. Social-justice movements such as the Arab Spring and Black Lives Matter owe some of the success of their early organizing efforts to the platform. Yet the website has also been one of the most reliable mainstream destinations on the internet to see Photoshopped images of public figures (or their family members) in gas chambers, or crude, racist cartoons of Jewish men. Now, under Musk’s stewardship, X seems to run in only one direction. The platform eschews healthy conversation. It abhors nuance, instead favoring constant escalation and engagement-baiting behavior. And it empowers movements that seek to enrage and divide. In April, an NBC News investigation found that “at least 150 paid ‘Premium’ subscriber X accounts and thousands of unpaid accounts have posted or amplified pro-Nazi content on X in recent months.” According to research from the extremism expert Colin Henry, since Musk’s purchase, there’s been a decline in anti-Semitic posts on 4chan’s infamous “anything goes” forum, and a simultaneous rise in posts targeting Jewish people on X. X’s own transparency reports show that the social network has allowed hateful content to flourish on its site. In its last report before Musk’s acquisition, in just the second half of 2021, Twitter suspended about 105,000 of the more than 5 million accounts reported for hateful conduct. In the first half of 2024, according to X, the social network received more than 66 million hateful-conduct reports, but suspended just 2,361 accounts. It’s not a perfect comparison, as the way X reports and analyzes data has changed under Musk, but the company is clearly taking action far less frequently. Read: I’m running out of ways to explain how bad this is Because X has made it more difficult for researchers to access data by switching to a paid plan that prices out many academics, it is now difficult to get a quantitative understanding of the platform’s degradation. The statistics that do exist are alarming. Research from the Center for Countering Digital Hate found that in just the first month of Musk’s ownership, anti–Black American slurs used on the platform increased by 202 percent. The Anti-Defamation League found that anti-Semitic tweets on the platform increased by 61 percent in just two weeks after Musk’s takeover. But much of the evidence is anecdotal. The Washington Post summed up a recent report from the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, noting that pro-Hitler content “reached the largest audiences on X [relative to other social-media platforms], where it was also most likely to be recommended via the site’s algorithm.” Since Musk took over, X has done the following: None of this is accidental. The output of a platform tells you what it is designed to do: In X’s case, all of this is proof of a system engineered to give voice to hateful ideas and reward those who espouse them. If one is to judge X by its main exports, then X, as it exists now under Musk, is a white-supremacist website. You might scoff at this notion, especially if you, like me, have spent nearly two decades willingly logged on to the site, or if you, like me, have had your professional life influenced in surprising, occasionally delightful ways by the platform. Even now, I can scroll through the site’s algorithmic pond scum and find things worth saving—interesting commentary, breaking news, posts and observations that make me laugh. But these exceptional morsels are what make the platform so insidious, in part because they give cover to the true political project that X now represents and empowers. As I was preparing to write this story, I visited some of the most vile corners of the internet. I’ve monitored these spaces for years, and yet this time, I was struck by how little distance there was between them and what X has become. It is impossible to ignore: The difference between X and a known hateful site such as Gab are people like myself. The majority of users are no doubt creators, businesses, journalists, celebrities, political junkies, sports fans, and other perfectly normal people who hold their nose and cling to the site. We are the human shield of respectability that keeps Musk’s disastrous $44 billion investment from being little more than an algorithmically powered Stormfront. The justifications—the lure of the community, the (now-limited) ability to bear witness to news in real time, and of the reach of one’s audience of followers—feel particularly weak today. X’s cultural impact is still real, but its promotional use is nonexistent. (A recent post linking to a story of mine generated 289,000 impressions and 12,900 interactions, but only 948 link clicks—a click rate of roughly 0.00328027682 percent.) NPR, which left the platform in April 2023, reported almost negligible declines in traffic referrals after abandoning the site. Continuing to post on X has been indefensible for some time. But now, more than ever, there is no good justification for adding one’s name to X’s list of active users. To leave the platform, some have argued, is to cede an important ideological battleground to the right. I’ve been sympathetic to this line of thinking, but the battle, on this particular platform, is lost. As long as Musk owns the site, its architecture will favor his political allies. If you see posting to X as a fight, then know it is not a fair one. For example: In October, Musk shared a fake screenshot of an Atlantic article, manipulated to show a fake headline—his post, which he never deleted, garnered more than 18 million views. The Atlantic’s X post debunking Musk’s claim received just 28,000 views. Musk is unfathomably rich. He’s used that money to purchase a platform, take it private, and effectively turn it into a megaphone for the world’s loudest racists. Now he’s attempting to use it to elect a corrupt, election-denying felon to the presidency. To stay on X is not an explicit endorsement of this behavior, but it does help enable it. I’m not at all suggesting—as Musk has previously alleged—that the site be shut down or that Musk should be silenced. But there’s no need to stick around and listen. Why allow Musk to appear even slightly more credible by lending our names, our brands, and our movements to a platform that makes the world more dangerous for real people? To my dismay, I’ve hid from these questions for too long. Now that I’ve confronted them, I have no good answers.

Title: Brendan Mullin one of the last great Irish players of rugby’s amateur era

Full Content:
Brendan Mullin (61), who has been found guilty on 12 charges of stealing hundreds of thousands of euro from Bank of Ireland Private Bank when he was its managing director a decade ago, was one of the last great Irish players of rugby’s amateur era. Born in Jerusalem, he was educated at Blackrock College, which he captained to a Schools Senior Cup success, scoring a hat-trick of tries in the final against King’s Hospital. He was also twice the senior boys All Ireland 110m hurdles champion (1980-1981). Mullin studied Law at Dublin University while representing Trinity at rugby. He also played club rugby with Blackrock College and London Irish. Mullin then headed for Oxford University, where he won a “Blue” playing in the annual Varsity match against Cambridge. Having represented Leinster and Ireland at schools’ level, he graduated to the senior ranks for province and country. He made his Ireland debut against the Grand Slam-winning Australia side in November 1984, a losing start as the home side went down 16-9, but there was better fortune around the corner as he was part of Mick Doyle’s Triple Crown and championship winning side (1985) in his rookie Test season. Mullin scored his first Irish try in that campaign, where he blocked down England fullback Chris Martin’s kick and regathered to dot down. An elegant centre with blistering pace and an underappreciated kicking game, he played alongside some very talented three-quarters in Irish backlines such as Simon Geoghegan, Dave Curtis, Jim Staples, Michael Kiernan, Keith Crossan, Trevor Ringland and Hugo MacNeill. [ Ex-rugby international Brendan Mullin found guilty of stealing hundreds of thousands of euro from bankOpens in new window ] A member of the Ireland squad for the first-ever World Cup in 1987, Mullin was subsequently selected for the 1989 British & Irish Lions tour to Australia under head coach Ian McGeechan, one of four Irish players in the original touring party, alongside Paul Dean, Steve Smith and Donal Lenihan, and played well enough to win a place in the first Test against the Wallabies, playing alongside Mike Hall (Wales). Mullin broke George Stephenson’s 62-year-old record as Ireland’s leading try scorer when he crossed for his 15th in a 28-25 defeat to Scotland at Murrayfield in March 1991 The Lions were thrashed 30-12, and among the changes for the final two Tests, both of which the Lions won to claim the series 2-1, was a new centre partnership of Scott Hastings and Jerry Guscott. Mullin did play another Test for the Lions, against France later that year, to celebrate the bicentenary of the French Revolution. He broke George Stephenson’s 62-year-old record as Ireland’s leading try scorer when he crossed for his 15th in a 28-25 defeat to Scotland at Murrayfield in March 1991, and later that year was part of the Ireland team that suffered a narrow World Cup quarter-final defeat at Lansdowne Road to the eventual champions, Australia. By the time he retired from rugby – he came back to play in the 1995 World Cup in South Africa, having been out of international rugby for two years, and retired for good after the quarter-final defeat to France, the last of his 55 Irish caps – Mullin had added another two tries to push the new Irish record to 17, a milestone that he retained for a dozen years until broken by Brian O’Driscoll. [ Brendan Mullin one of the last great Irish players of rugby’s amateur eraOpens in new window ] The former Ireland captain eclipsed the mark when he scored his 18th Irish try against Italy in Rome (2003) on his 35th cap, 20 fewer than it took Mullin, who sent O’Driscoll a congratulatory note and a signed jersey from that final cap against France in the 1995 World Cup. He said in a subsequent interview when asked about losing the record to O’Driscoll: “No regrets at all. It’s a milestone. It was something I was very proud to hold on to for a while, but it’s something to be broken. Many more players will break that milestone and that’s good for Irish rugby, while Brian will go on to score many more tries.” Mullin is due to be sentenced on November 25th.

Title: British Pension Fund Joins Bitcoin Rush, Invests 3% Of Its Total Assets In BTC

In a major adoption boost for Bitcoin, a United Kingdom-based pension fund has added the bellwether crypto to its balance sheet — marking the first move of its kind in the nation. According to pension advisory firm Cartwright, the undisclosed fund made a 3% allocation to the apex cryptocurrency. Pensions specialist Cartwright announced Monday that it had successfully guided an unnamed client in the UK to make a considerable investment into Bitcoin. In October, the client in question allocated 3% of its £50 million ($65 million) to BTC after “lengthy consultations with the scheme’s trustees, where ESG, investment case, and security were all addressed at length,” Glenn Cameron, head of digital assets at Cartwright told Corporate Advisor. What makes this investment particularly noteworthy is that the pension fund is actually investing in Bitcoin itself rather than a proxy such as a spot BTC ETF. The report reveals that the private key is divided between five separate institutions. Cartwright said it had made the recommendation owing to Bitcoin’s long-term returns. According to CoinGecko data, the top crypto has soared by almost 100,000% since 2013. According to Sam Roberts, the firm’s director of investment consulting, Bitcoin is well suited to the scheme’s 10-year investment horizon. “Trustees are increasingly looking for innovative solutions to future-proof their schemes in the face of economic challenges,” Roberts posited. This Bitcoin allocation is a strategic move that not only offers diversification but also taps into an asset class with a unique asymmetric risk-return profile.” Roberts further said he hoped the “strategic move” would be emulated by others. “We are proud to have led this groundbreaking move,” he declared, “which we hope will be the start of a trend for institutional investors in the UK to catch up with their increasing number of peers and competitors around the world who are already taking advantage of Bitcoin’s unique attributes.” Cartwright further stated that it anticipates institutional Bitcoin adoption to be similar to when pension schemes started purchasing equities in the 1970s. It might be painfully slow at first, but then, ultimately, it would become a bad idea not to allocate the asset to a portfolio. Cameron also believes that Bitcoin’s unique asymmetric return profile indicates that even a small allocation can considerably improve financial performance. Institutional adoption of Bitcoin has skyrocketed across the globe, specifically in the United States, following the Securities and Exchange Commission’s historic greenlighting of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in January. These novel investment vehicles allow traditional investors to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency through stock-like shares on regulated exchanges without the hassle of storing the asset. The funds were introduced by Wall Street giants, including BlackRock and Fidelity, and have so far collectively accumulated over 1 million BTC — fast closing in on Satoshi Nakamoto’s stack.

Title: Michigan Becomes First State Pension Fund To Invest In Ethereum ETFs With $10 Million Buy

The State of Michigan Retirement System has disclosed a new holding in Grayscale’s Ethereum exchange-traded fund, becoming the first public pension fund to do so since the ETH-based product commenced trading on U.S. exchanges in July. This strategic move marks a huge step for institutional investment in crypto assets, as the Michigan Retirement System manages roughly $13.6 billion in pension fund assets for state employees. In a 13-F disclosure filed Monday with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Michigan’s pension fund revealed it has scooped up 460,000 shares in Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust (ETHE), valued at approximately $10.07 million, along with an additional 1.1 million worth of shares in the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust (ETH). According to VanEck’s head of digital asset research, Matthew Sigel, Michigan has now become one of the top five holders of Grayscale’s ETH and ETHE. What’s more interesting is that the Michigan pension fund now owns more Ether than Bitcoin, despite the latter being greenlighted by the securities regulator several months in advance. The move sets Michigan apart as most state pension funds focus mostly on Bitcoin investments. As revealed in its latest SEC filing, the Michigan pension fund continues to hold its Bitcoin investment with 110,000 shares in the ARK 21Shares BTC ETF, worth roughly $7 million. “Not only did Michigan’s pension buy ether ETFs, but they bought more than they did of Bitcoin ETFs, $10 million vs $7 million, this despite BTC being up a ton and ether in the gutter,” Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas posited in a post on X. “Pretty big win for ether, which could use one.” Following the approval of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, institutional investors have become more comfortable with dipping their toes into the fast-growing asset class. In May, the State of Wisconsin Investment Board made a trailblazing move by picking up a $100 million investment in the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund issued by investment giant BlackRock. Notably, Florida CFO Jimmy Patronis recently sent a letter requesting a report on considering Bitcoin and other digital assets as viable investments for state pension funds. This move signals that more and more states are now eyeing crypto as a viable investment for pension funds.

Group plans to buy company behind Conlons & Sons in Co Kildare Frank Keane also operates Volkswagen dealerships in Dublin Frank Keane Motors plans to buy company behind Co Kildare BMW dealership BMW. Photo: Getty Frank Keane Motors – a BMW dealership for almost 60 years – is planning to buy Conlons & Sons in Co Kildare in a deal that’s likely to be worth well in excess of €20m. If approved by the competition watchdog, it will create a group with turnover easily exceeding €300m a year. Frank Keane Motors has just notified the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) that it intends to buy the entire issued share capital of Pavla Unlimited in Naas. Both companies sell new and used cars and are BMW dealerships, with Conlon & Sons selling the eponymous marque as well as Mini, Jaguar and Land Rover. Frank Keane Motors also sells Volkswagen vehicles and light commercial vehicles. It is also a wholesale distributor of FUSO trucks and MG passenger cars. Today's News in 90 Seconds - November 6th Recent company filings for Pavla – controlled by Ray and Nicholas Conlon - show that last month it issued shares valued at almost €23m to a company called Bonaghmore Holdings. Pavla was only incorporated during the summer. Bonaghmore Holdings is in turn owned by a company called Gledstanes, which was also set up during the summer. The most recent set of publicly available accounts for Bonaghmore Holdings show that it generated sales of €84.8m in the 12 months to the end of August 2023, up from €71.4m a year earlier. The company made a €6.1m pre-tax profit in the 2023 financial year, which compared with almost €6.9m in the previous year. It had shareholder funds of €41.5m at the end of the 2023 financial year. Frank Keane Group is unlimited and does not have to file publicly available accounts. However, its turnover is likely to be north of €250m a year. Founded in 1967, it was awarded the BMW franchise for Ireland that year. It now employs about 300 people. It operates a BMW dealership on the Naas Road in Dublin as well as one on Blackrock in the capital’s southside. It also has a Mini dealership on the Nass Road. The firm has two Volkswagen dealerships, both of which are in Dublin. The CCPC said submissions from third parties in relation to the proposed acquisition of Pavla Unlimited are due by December 13 as part of its preliminary investigation in the deal.

Title: Investor Anthony Pompliano Calls Bitcoin ‘Gold With Wings,’ Says BTC the Savings Account of the New Generation

Longtime crypto bull Anthony Pompliano believes that the flagship digital asset Bitcoin (BTC) is gold on steroids. In a new interview on Fox Business, the founder of venture capital firm Pomp Investments says that the debasement of the US dollar is bullish for both Bitcoin and gold, but the flagship crypto asset could outperform the precious metal due to increasing adoption. “If you look at gold and the S&P 500 over the last five years, the compound annual growth rate is about the same. Gold is up 13% and the S&P is up 14%. Bitcoin has destroyed that. And so I like to say that Bitcoin is gold with wings. Bitcoin and gold both go up for the same reason. They’re debasing the dollar. But Bitcoin is much more sensitive. It’s an earlier asset that the world is trying to price in. What’s very unique about Bitcoin is that it’s a bottom-up story. Most technology goes top-down. Militaries and governments, they adopt it first, then corporations and then finally individuals. They get a smartphone or they get a computer on their desk. They’re the last ones. Bitcoin was the opposite. The individuals got it first. Now we’re seeing corporations and financial institutions like BlackRock and Fidelity start to adopt this. Eventually, it’s going to be central banks and it is going to be governments. Central banks today own 12% of the global gold supply. I believe that they will eventually start to buy Bitcoin. That would be very bullish for the price of Bitcoin.” He also believes that people will increasingly store their wealth in stablecoins and Bitcoin instead of a traditional bank account. “If you think of the traditional financial system, you have a checking account, you got a savings account. That checking account is being replaced by stablecoins. It’s just dollars in a digital rail. Bitcoin is becoming that savings account and the beauty of a savings account is you put your money there and you don’t move it. So if you go and you look on-chain, you can see that more than one out of every two Bitcoin has not moved in the last two years, and two out of every three Bitcoin has not moved in the last 12 months even though Bitcoin’s price has tripled during that time period.” Bitcoin is trading for $67,694 at time of writing, down 1.5% in the last 24 hours.

Title: ‘I could have been dead’: Food delivery driver in shock after being attacked in Cork

As he recovers from the surgery he underwent on Friday to reconstruct the broken bones in his left leg, Brazilian delivery rider Alexandre Athos Pinheiro Teixeira (23) is still in shock after being chased then rammed as he worked in Cork on Halloween night. Shortly before midnight Mr Teixeira, who also studies English in Ireland, had just completed a delivery on his motorbike in the Blackrock area of the city when he noticed a grey car stopping and reversing in his direction. “I thought someone had gone the wrong way or something, that’s normal. I swerved to avoid the car,” he says. Moments later, when he tried to overtake it, however, he was suddenly attacked by a man “wearing a mask and a bandanna. The car’s back door opened, and a person jumped out of the car towards me. “I thought: ‘Wow, I’m going to get robbed,’ or something like that, but I still didn’t know if it was a Halloween prank. And I sped up. Then the person tried to pull me but he couldn’t. I sped up and left. “I thought they were going to leave me alone at that point, but they didn’t. My motorbike isn’t very fast and their car was much faster. So, when they caught up to me, I braked and turned back to try to lose them.” To try to escape, Mr Teixeira entered a residential area but he was caught as he tried to make a sudden turn. “They knocked me off the motorcycle with the car, but at that moment I hadn’t been hurt yet. I was fine,” he says. The same attacker who had earlier jumped out of the car emerged from the vehicle again. “I started screaming: ‘Why are you doing this to me? Why are you doing this to me?’” The man started swinging punches in the direction of Mr Teixeira, who sought to hit him back. “I managed to punch him and he got back in the car,” he says. He was then caught off guard for a moment and the driver accelerated towards him. “This part is a kind of a blur in my mind, but I remember my leg cracking. I think it got between the fender (mudguard) of my motorcycle and the bumper of the car,” Mr Teixeira said. [ Gardaí recover stolen car used to ram Deliveroo driver (23) in alleged road rage incidentOpens in new window ] The occupants of the car left the scene, abandoning their victim who was lying trapped by his motorbike with severe compound fractures in his left leg. “If I had landed on my hip,” he says, “I could have been in a wheelchair. If I had landed on my head near the car, I could have been dead. They would have killed me.” Mr Teixeira told The Irish Times he managed to call an emergency group of delivery workers and send them his location. “They came to where I was and helped me,” he says. Residents also heard the collision and discovered the victim in severe pain on the street and called emergency assistance. He was brought to Cork University Hospital, where he underwent surgery. “I think it’ll be a few months of recovery,” he says. Mr Teixeira says he saw a man driving the car, a woman front passenger, and another man in the back. All were in their 20s, he believes. Gardaí recovered a stolen Skoda Kodiaq – believed to have been used to ram Mr Teixeira – burnt out in a field in Carrignavar, 12km north of Cork city, early on Friday morning and have begun a technical examination of the vehicle. The same car is believed to have rammed a Garda vehicle at about 2am on the Old Mallow Road on the northside of the city, about 8km from the scene of the hit and run. Two gardaí were treated for minor injuries at the scene. Gardaí suspect that the occupant or occupants of the stolen Skoda Kodiaq were collected by a driver in another car. Gardaí have requested witnesses or anyone with footage of either incident to contact them at Anglesea Street station at 021 452 000 or the Confidential Line at 1800 666 111. © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

In a 13-F disclosure filed Monday with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the state fund revealed it has picked up $10 million worth of shares from Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust (ETHE). What’s surprising is that the fund now owns more Ethereum than Bitcoin, despite the latter being approved first by the securities regulator many months in advance. Monday’s records show the fund scooped a further $1.1 million worth of shares from the digital asset manager’s Ethereum Mini Trust. It also marks the first U.S. state pension fund to invest in Ethereum ETFs, providing crypto enthusiasts with confidence the asset is becoming more entrenched in the traditional financial world. It follows the fund’s recent purchase of $6.6 million worth of ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF in July, which followed the SEC's regulatory approval of the asset class for the investment vehicle in January. ETHE represents a fractional ownership of Ethereum held by Grayscale on behalf of the trust’s shareholders. Each share gives indirect exposure to the performance of Ethereum without the need for direct ownership. ETHE has experienced significant net outflows since its conversion to an ETF in July 2024. On its first trading day, Grayscale’s flagship Ethereum fund saw outflows of $484 million, and by early August, total outflows had exceeded $2 billion, data from SoSoValue shows. The launch of multiple spot US-based Ethereum ETFs by firms this year, including BlackRock, Fidelity, and Bitwise, has all but intensified competition, particularly when it comes to fees. While ETHE charges 2.5%, rivals BlackRock (ETHA) and Fidelity (FETH) are expected to charge 0.12% and 0.25% following the expiration of their fee waiver slated for December 31.

Pensions advisory firm Cartwright announced Monday that it had told an unnamed client in the UK to make a 3% allocation to the leading cryptocurrency. The firm said that it made the recommendation because of Bitcoin’s long-term gains. The cryptocurrency has risen in price by nearly 100,000% since 2013, CoinGecko data shows. “Trustees of the unnamed scheme choose to make a 3% Bitcoin allocation, reflecting the scheme’s relatively long investment time horizon,” the announcement said. Cartwright’s director of investment consulting at Cartwright, Sam Roberts, said that he hoped the “strategic move” would be followed by others. “We are proud to have led this groundbreaking move,” he said, “which we hope will be the start of a trend for institutional investors in the UK to catch up with their increasing number of peers and competitors around the world who are already taking advantage of Bitcoin’s unique attributes.” Cartwright said it expects institutional adoption of Bitcoin to be similar to when pension schemes started buying equities in the 1970s: It may be slow at first, but then eventually will seem like a bad idea to not allocate the asset to a portfolio. Institutional adoption of Bitcoin has grown around the world—but particularly in the U.S.—following the January approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The funds allow investors to buy exposure to the cryptocurrency via stock-like shares that trade on regulated exchanges. Major Wall Street players including BlackRock and Fidelity launched the funds, and have so far collectively snapped up over 1 million Bitcoin—or $67 billion worth at today’s prices Edited by Andrew Hayward Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2024 Decrypt Media, Inc.

Title: Lex: Warren Buffett’s Apple trade exposes Berkshire’s dilemma

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. Lex is the flagship investment column of the Financial Times and has published in the newspaper since 1945. OPINION What is the next great investment idea? And what are the chances that Warren Buffett will be the person to identify it? Wall Street likes his odds. Shares in the class B of Berkshire Hathaway are up 25% so far in 2024. And the rally comes as Buffett has been rapidly paring back his blockbuster win in Apple stock. On Saturday Berkshire Hathaway reported its third-quarter results, most notably that its cash and marketable securities balance had swelled to $325 billion (NZ$543.9b). A big chunk of that has come from share sales of Apple whose value for Berkshire now stands at $70b, down from a peak of $178b. Berkshire invested initially in Apple in 2016 when its share price was around $25 a share. Today Apple trades above $200. Berkshire’s total book value through the third quarter was $631b, while its public equity market capitalisation is just shy of $1 trillion. That premium to net asset value reflects a vote of confidence from shareholders that Buffett, at 94, has another similar masterstroke in him. Buffett for now, however, is increasingly content to clip US Treasury coupons earning a few percentage points, risk free, with no dividends or real buybacks for Berkshire shareholders. It comes as other big pools of capital – alternative asset managers as well as BlackRock – are pouring funds into all types of plain and exotic private credit as well as long-tailed infrastructure and data centre deals. Blackstone, for example, has deployed $123b in the past 12 months mostly away from either public or even private equity. To be sure, Berkshire’s property and casualty insurance business carries out all sorts of sophisticated trading and hedging activities. But the investment group is best known for largely buying public, large-cap equities as well as mega operating business platforms such as power utilities and railroads. In the absence of a financial markets crisis where Buffett could play white knight to handsome reward, there is a question in calm markets if he needs to choose less vanilla securities. The sheer size of Berkshire now makes it hard to find single investments that can move the needle. Its securities portfolio of more than $300b has fewer than 30 stocks and the next Apple probably needs to be an up-and-coming Big Tech luminary. Buffett’s Apple bonanza helped obscure the dearth of juicy opportunities for Berkshire. That dilemma is now back on the table. © Financial Times Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read.

Title: Lam Research Corporation (LRCX) Faces Struggles Amid Semiconductor Short Positions

Time Published: 2024-11-04T17:52:44Z

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Jefferies’ Top Crowded Semiconductor Short Positions: Top 10 Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX) stands against other Jefferies’ top crowded semiconductor short positions' stocks. With the third quarter earnings season with us, the semiconductor industry continues to be filled with surprises. 2023 and the better part of 2024 have seen investors remain bullish about chips due to the increased market size resulting from artificial intelligence. Yet–at the same time–the pipers of Wall Street have also been wary of over-investing in artificial intelligence and the state of the broader chip manufacturing industry apart from the fortunes of the AI industry. For the latter front, October has been quite eventful. It once again reminded us that even the firms closest to a monopoly these days aren’t immune from either macroeconomic headwinds or from worried investors. It saw the shares of the most important company in the semiconductor industry tank by a stunning 21.64% in just two days after a rather interesting set of events. This stock ranked 8th on our recent list of AI stocks that were trending in the news and this was unsurprising. It was due to report its earnings on October 16th, but the report ended up leaking a day earlier. Earnings leaks are a serious matter, and even more so for this firm since its business provides investors with early insight into the affairs of the semiconductor industry ahead of an earnings cycle for other firms. The leaked earnings saw the firm guide its 2025 net sales at a midpoint of €32.5 billion as it warned that the weakness in the semiconductor industry “is expected to continue in 2025, which is leading to customer cautiousness.” Since its machines are booked months in advance, the firm has a greater insight into its future cash flows than others, and investors were further spooked by its bookings. The bookings sat at €2.6 billion as of the third quarter, for a wide miss over midpoint analyst estimates of €5 billion. Consequently, investors weren’t impressed. The day that the earnings report leaked, the shares dropped by 16% for their biggest one-day drop in more than two decades. They continued their downward spiral the following day to close 6.42% lower and extend the two-day cumulative drop to 21.64%. While these drops might seem to be a bit too much since after all, you don’t see multi-decade records get broken every day, they stem from the uncertainty that investors have to contend with when analyzing complex industries such as semiconductor fabrication. Broadly speaking, the semiconductor industry is divided into three tiers. Starting from the top, firms like GPU and CPU designers are responsible for selling products to consumers and businesses. The second tier is made of manufacturers which produce the chips and the third is made of firms that provide the manufacturing equipment. Consequently, the fact that the chip manufacturing equipment provider’s downbeat revenue guidance wiped off billions of dollars of capital from the semiconductor industry was unsurprising. As per Bloomberg, following the bookings miss and lower guidance, US-listed chip stocks, and Asian stocks bled a collective $420 billion in value. Michael Roeg, an analyst at investment bank Petercam Degroof provided more color into the drop. After the release, he shared that sales trends at the world’s largest contract chip manufacturer “are a misleading indicator for the overall health of the semiconductor industry.” This is because the firm “has been spending rather low capex numbers so far this year, and they may do so again next year because their overall (plant) utilization is not as good as their sales numbers suggest.” Utilization refers to the percentage of time that expensive chip machines are running and producing chips and fabs prefer to have high rates since it decreases the time it takes for them to recuperate their investment. Low capital expenditure affects utilization since if utilization is low then chip manufacturers do not feel the need to spend heavily for new machines. In sum, these trends mean that semiconductor spending at the bottom tier of the industry remains muted unless demand picks up and utilization grows. Shifting gears, the top tier of the industry is divided into several categories. One category includes firms like Wall Street’s favorite AI stock, the GPU designer whose shares are up 198% year-to-date. Due to the market’s rush into AI, while investors have been kind to this firm, they have been far more prudent for others. One such firm is responsible for manufacturing silicon carbide chips that are used for power management by electric vehicles. Since the demand for EV vehicles has slowed, leading to the shares of Elon Musk’s car company losing 12.3% year to date, the shares of this firm haven’t done well either. They are down 18.3% year to date, and if you’re interested in knowing more about this stock, we’ve included it in today’s list. This overall bifurcation in the semiconductor industry hasn’t skipped the attention of institutional investors. According to Jefferies’ October Trading Positioning Survey, the percentage of investors overweight on semiconductor stocks was 42%, a strong 18-point drop over July’s figures. The funds that were underweight on these stocks grew by five points from July to sit at 16%, so let’s take a look at the stocks that they have shorted. To make our list of Jefferies’ top overcrowded semiconductor short positions, we ranked the top ten crowded short positions from the latest Trading Positioning Survey by their shares short as a percentage of outstanding shares. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A technician operating an automated semiconductor processing machine with laser accuracy. Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q2 2024: 84 Shares Short % Of Outstanding: 2.49% Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX) is one of the few companies in the world that makes and sells products that are used in several phases of semiconductor fabrication. These phases include etching, deposition, and managing intra-chip connecting circuits called interconnects. Its product portfolio also makes Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX) a good example of a chip stock that is struggling these days even though AI optimism still persists on Wall Street. The shares are down 2.58% year to date due to multiple factors. Firstly, during its fiscal 2024, 42% of Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX)’s revenue came from the memory industry. This industry has struggled in 2023 and has been on a slow recovery this year which hasn’t helped ignite investor consequences. Secondly, 42% of its revenue came from China, where not only have economic struggles hurt Lam Research Corporation’s (NASDAQ:LRCX) revenue but investors are also wary of future sanctions. Artisan Partners mentioned Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said: “The top contributors to performance for the quarter were Alphabet, Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX) and Elevance. Lam Research shares rose 10% during the quarter and are up 67% over the past year, primarily due to optimism around the pending investment cycle in semiconductor capital expenditures. Lam is one of the largest equipment manufacturers used to make semiconductor chips. This equipment, commonly referred to as WFE (wafer fabrication equipment), is expected to experience significant growth due to a combination of a cyclical rebound in memory chips and growing demand for new AI-related chips. Lam’s product portfolio is particularly well positioned to benefit from both trends and should grow even faster than the overall market. Its shares now trade at ~30X prior peak earnings, which suggests this dynamic is well understood by the market and is mostly priced in.” Overall, LRCX ranks 7th on our list of Jefferies’ top crowded semiconductor short positions' stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of LRCX as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than LRCX but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Crypto Voters In 2024 And Beyond: Shaping Policy And Political Power

PARIS, FRANCE - JANUARY 11: In this photo illustration, a visual representation of the digital ... [+] cryptocurrency Bitcoin is displayed in front of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) logo on January 11, 2024 in Paris, France. The first American Bitcoin ETF was authorized by the SEC (Commissioner of the American Stock Exchange) on Wednesday January 10, 2024. Around ten of the world's largest financial asset managers have filed an application with the SEC to launch a Bitcoin. ETFs. After blocking bitcoin from entering Wall Street for more than 10 years, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has given the green light to exchange-traded funds (ETFs) invested in bitcoin. (Photo illustration by Chesnot/Getty Images) The 2024 election cycle has brought an unexpected issue to the forefront of U.S. politics: cryptocurrency. Both major political parties are addressing digital assets, blockchain technology, and regulatory frameworks, as crypto has grown from a niche investment to a mainstream topic. Candidates are now actively courting the "crypto voter," recognizing the widespread appeal and economic potential of the digital asset economy. Crypto’s newfound prominence is fueled by recent moves from major financial institutions like BlackRock and Fidelity, which have entered the Bitcoin ETF market, lending further legitimacy to crypto assets. Political action committees like the Stand With Crypto Alliance and Fairshake Super PAC are also pouring resources into pro-crypto candidates, positioning cryptocurrency as a policy issue that cuts across party lines. As political candidates and parties look to gain traction with voters, crypto has proven to be a compelling, if divisive, topic that speaks to younger, tech-savvy demographics and finance industry titans alike. In this election, crypto’s appeal in key swing states could impact close races as candidates respond to a unique confluence of voter interest and economic opportunity. Polling data from industry leaders such as Digital Currency Group (DCG), Paradigm, and Stand With Crypto highlights a distinct “crypto voter” demographic. This emerging constituency is becoming a powerful influence in electoral decisions. According to a ConsenSys/HarrisX survey, 92% of crypto owners are committed to voting in 2024, which underscores the political mobilization within this group​. Stand With Crypto reports that 71% of self-identified crypto voters across political parties prefer candidates who support transparent and fair crypto regulations. This figure underscores mounting frustration over vague and restrictive U.S. crypto policies. Additionally, a DCG survey shows that 62% of young voters (ages 18–34) are “more likely” to support a candidate who advocates for crypto-friendly policies, as this demographic views digital assets as essential for financial inclusion, offering an alternative to traditional financial systems. The HarrisX survey also notes that crypto owners skew younger, male, urban, and are more racially diverse than the average voter base, with 33% of surveyed crypto voters identifying as non-white​. Crypto is also gaining traction in swing states like Georgia, Pennsylvania, and Arizona, where Paradigm polling found that 28% of likely voters consider a candidate’s stance on crypto important. Stand With Crypto’s data further highlights crypto’s relevance for minority voters in swing states; for instance, 23% of Black and Latino voters rate pro-crypto policies as a top priority, emphasizing the potential for digital assets to broaden access to financial services in underserved communities. Polling reveals that distrust in traditional financial institutions is a significant factor for crypto interest among voters. DCG reports that 58% of respondents cited distrust of banks and financial institutions as a primary reason for exploring digital assets, pointing to a broader trend of viewing decentralized finance (DeFi) and blockchain as viable alternatives to traditional banking systems. Interest in crypto spans the political spectrum, with 43% of Republicans and 39% of Democrats favoring “sensible regulation” to promote innovation without stifling growth. Despite bipartisan appeal, support for crypto-friendly candidates leans slightly Democratic, with 54% favoring candidates like Vice President Harris, who emphasizes crypto’s potential to promote economic advancement for the middle class. For many crypto voters, financial inclusion remains central; nearly 75% view digital assets as a means to create economic opportunity, particularly for communities historically marginalized by traditional finance. Among Democratic voters, crypto is particularly popular among non-white demographics, with 22% of Black Democrats and 25% of Hispanic Democrats owning crypto​. For Republicans, 41% of non-white Republicans own or have bought crypto​. Crypto ownership is highest among Republicans under 40, with 45% of this group involved in crypto, emphasizing youth-driven interest​. These findings illustrate how crypto’s role in the 2024 election is nuanced, resonating particularly with younger and minority voters. Candidates paying attention to these trends are likely to adopt more balanced and informed regulatory approaches. Money has long been a double-edged sword in American politics. Financial contributions help amplify candidates’ platforms but can also create imbalances. Financial backing enables candidates to reach more voters and cover costs for travel, events, and advertisements. However, donations from wealthier interests can tilt the playing field, creating the perception that policies favor the elite over the public. Crypto PACs have infused $119 million into the 2024 election cycle, accounting for nearly half of corporate donations, with Fairshake PAC alone raising over $200 million to back pro-crypto candidates, second only to a major pro-Trump super PAC​. Coinbase, a major player, has directed $50 million to Fairshake PAC, positioning it as a major influencer in various congressional races, including both Republican and Democratic candidates who support pro-crypto legislation​. This influx of crypto money, particularly from PACs and industry-focused initiatives, adds another layer of complexity, as blockchain-based prediction markets like Polymarket allow users to gauge public sentiment on political outcomes. While these decentralized markets offer real-time data, they also pose regulatory challenges and concerns over transparency. Blockchain-based prediction markets such as Polymarket provide a unique view of public sentiment on political outcomes by allowing users to wager on election results. Although these platforms offer valuable insights, they also highlight the need for new regulatory frameworks to manage potential manipulation risks. Polymarket’s emergence reflects the broader impact of blockchain technology in politics, where its applications extend beyond financial innovation into political influence. The trajectory of cryptocurrency in U.S. policy will largely depend on the new administration’s approach to balancing innovation with consumer protection. Institutional interest in digital assets, as seen in the rise of Bitcoin ETFs and DeFi platforms, suggests that crypto is here to stay. However, to responsibly harness this potential, the U.S. must adopt forward-thinking policies that encourage innovation while managing risks. To address the critical needs of the digital economy, the next administration must consider the following: The 2024 election has solidified cryptocurrency’s role as a transformative force in politics. Its ability to bridge divides and appeal to diverse constituencies positions digital assets as an influential issue for American voters. As the next administration shapes its crypto policies, its approach to regulation, financial inclusion, and international cooperation will determine the U.S.’s standing in the global digital economy. By embracing sound policies, the U.S. has the opportunity to lead the way, fostering a prosperous future for early adopters and cautious newcomers alike. One Community. Many Voices.

Title: Chip fever has created an $11 billion debt market backed by Nvidia's AI-enabling GPUs

Top Wall Street firms have loaned billions to a handful of tech companies that have used Nvidia's artificial intelligence-enabling GPUs as collateral, The Finanacial Times reported. According to the FT, big financial institutions including BlackRock, Blackstone, Pimco, and Carlyle, have made over $11 billion in loans to "neocloud" companies, tech companies that provide cloud services to other tech firms building AI products. These firms are among some of Nvidia's largest customers and include names like CoreWeave, Crusoe, and Lambda Labs. Collectively, they have purchased tens of thousands of Nvidia's highly sought-after chips and have offered them as collateral for loans that they use to buy even more GPUs, the report said. There are concerns, though, over the value of Nvidia's GPUs, with the price of existing AI chips potentially coming down as more advanced models are released and as companies potentially dial back AI spending. Having access to GPUs is no longer like having a "golden ticket to Willy Wonka's factory," as it was considered to be a year ago, a senior executive at one of CoreWeave's lenders told the FT. Leasing contracts between neocloud firms and tech groups, meanwhile, are poised to expire in the coming years. That could result in a huge supply of chips making their way back to the market, the report added. CoreWeave, Crusoe, and Lambda Labs did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. Nvidia declined to comment. Elsewhere on Wall Street, there are concerns that Nvidia's huge pace of growth cannot be sustained, with doubts rising about returns on AI investment by corporations and the threat of competition from other chip makers muscling into the AI space.

The Fed cut its benchmark rate by 50 basis points in September, indicating a turning point in its management of the U.S. economy and in its outlook for inflation. In late-September reports, strategists at JPMorgan and Fitch Ratings had predicted two additional interest rate trims by the end of 2024 and expect such reductions to continue into 2025. The CME Group's FedWatch tool puts the probability of a 25 basis point cut at this week's November meeting at 98%. The current probability of the benchmark rate being taken down by another 25 basis points at the December meeting is 78%. But some CEOs appear skeptical. Speaking last week at Saudi Arabia's showcase economic conference, the Future Investment Initiative, they see more inflation on the horizon for the U.S., as the nation's economic activity and both presidential candidates' policies involve developments that will potentially be inflationary and stimulatory — such as public spending, the onshoring of manufacturing and tariffs. A group of CEOs speaking at an FII panel moderated by CNBC's Sara Eisen — which included Wall Street hegemons such as the bosses of Goldman Sachs, Carlyle, Morgan Stanley, Standard Chartered and State Street — were asked to raise their hand if they thought two additional rate cuts would be implemented by the Fed this year. No one put their hand up. "I think inflation is stickier, honestly, you look at the kind of jobs report and the wage reports in the U.S., I think it's going to be hard for inflation to come down to the 2% level," Jenny Johnson, Franklin Templeton president and CEO, told CNBC in an interview Wednesday, saying she thinks only one further interest rate cut will take place this year. "Remember a year ago, we were all here talking about recession? Was there going to be [one]? Nobody's talking about recession anymore," she said. Larry Fink, whose mammoth BlackRock fund oversees over $10 trillion in assets, also sees one rate reduction before the end of 2024. "I think it's fair to say we're going to have at least a 25 [basis-point cut], but, that being said, I do believe we have greater embedded inflation in the world than we've ever seen," Fink said at another FII panel last week. "We have government and policy that is much more inflationary. Immigration — our policies of onshoring, all of this — no one is asking the question 'at what cost.' Historically we were, I would say, a more consumer-driven economy, the cheapest products were the best and the most progressive way of politicking," he noted. America's consumer price index, a key inflation gauge, was up 2.4% in September compared with the same period in 2023, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. That figure is a tick down from the 2.5% print of August, implying a slowdown in price growth. The September reading was also the smallest annual one since February 2021. On Friday, new data showed U.S. job creation in October slowed to its weakest pace since late 2020. Markets largely ignored the bad news, as the nonfarm payrolls report flagged acute climate and labor disruptions. Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon said inflation will more embedded into the global economy than what market participants are currently predicting, meaning price rises could prove to be stickier than the consensus. "That doesn't mean that it's going to rear its head in a particularly ugly way, but I do think there's the potential, depending on policy actions that are taken, that it can be more of a headwind than the current market consensus," he said. Morgan Stanley CEO Ted Pick went even further, declaring last Tuesday that the days of easy money and zero interest rates are firmly in the past. "The end of financial repression, of zero interest rates and zero inflation, that era is over. Interest rates will be higher, will be challenged around the world. And the end of 'the end of history' — geopolitics are back and will be part of the challenge for decades to come," Pick said, referencing the famous 1992 Francis Fukuyama book, "The End of History and the Last Man," which argued that conflicts between nations and ideologies were a thing of the past with the ending of the Cold War. Speaking on Eisen's panel Tuesday, Apollo Global CEO Marc Rowan even questioned why the Fed was cutting rates at a time when so much fiscal stimulus had propped up a healthy-looking U.S. economy. He noted the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act and the CHIPS and Science Act and an increase in defense production. "We're all talking about, in the U.S., of shades of good. We really are talking about shades of good. And to come back to your point on rates, we massively increased rates, and yet, [the] stock market [is] at a record high, no unemployment, capital market issuance at will, and we're stimulating the economy?" he said. "I'm trying to remember why we're cutting rates, other than to try and equalize the bottom quartile," he later added. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

Title: Here’s How Much J.D. Vance Is Worth
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/kylemullins/2024/11/04/heres-how-much-jd-vance-is-worth/
Time Published: 2024-11-04T06:29:26Z
Full Content:
Update (Nov. 4, 2024): Two years ago, JD Vance was an Ohio venture capitalist best known for writing a book that helped explain the rise of Donald Trump to liberal coastal elites. Today, he’s a firebrand senator whose first and only election victory was bankrolled by PayPal billionaire Peter Thiel and who now has a shot of becoming Donald Trump’s heir apparent. Since we published his net worth estimate back in July, not much has changed on the financial front for him—media attention has mostly focused on past and present controversial remarks about abortion, women, immigrants and more. But a promotion to vice president would come with a compensation bump to $235,000 from his current Senate salary of $174,000. It would also set the 40-year-old up for a future White House run of his own—and all the monetary perks that come with it. Donald Trump and his running mate, J.D. Vance, come from two different Americas. In Trump’s, fathers start passing down real-estate fortunes to their kids when they are toddlers. In Vance’s, fathers don’t even leave kids with their last names. Raised mostly by his mother’s parents, the Vances, J.D. Vance catapulted himself from Rust Belt poverty to coastal high society with a degree from Yale Law School, a marriage to another lawyer and the publication of “Hillbilly Elegy,” a memoir about Vance’s upbringing. The book came out in the summer of 2016 just as Donald Trump was surging in the polls, leaving liberals searching for something, anything, to explain Trump’s popularity in Middle America. “Hillbilly Elegy” made Vance rich—it reportedly sold more than three million copies—and turned him into a national figure. Today, he is worth an estimated $10 million. Given where he started, it’s a remarkable sum, one that solidifies Vance’s place in circles that might have made his younger self uncomfortable. Vance wrote in his book about how odd he found a particular kind of charity—wealthy families picking out gifts for low-income kids, not knowing what those kids actually wanted or needed. “I grew up in a world where everyone worried about how they’d pay for Christmas,” he wrote. “Now I live in one where opportunities abound for the wealthy and privileged to shower their generosity on the community’s poor.” V ance’s maternal grandparents moved from Jackson, Kentucky to Middletown, Ohio as part of the 1950s mass migration to industrial centers. His grandfather worked in an Armco steel plant his whole career, and they raised three kids. That included Vance’s mother, who had Vance, her second child, in 1984, at age 23, with her second husband. By then, the Steel Belt had begun to rust, eventually leaving Middletown “little more than a relic of American industrial glory,” as Vance put it. His childhood was chaotic, laced with dropouts, alcoholics and violence, problems he chalks up to both structural factors—economic insecurity, a culture that “encourages social decay”—and individual bad decisions. Vance’s father was largely out of the picture early, and his mother cycled through husbands, abusive episodes and rehab stints. A product of his environment, moving between homes, sometimes Vance was dysfunctional, too. The only relative stability he had came from his grandparents, who stressed education, but Vance racked up so many unexcused absences from class at one point that the school district threatened his divorced parents with prosecution. He finished his freshman year of high school with a 2.1 grade-point average. Life changed when Vance moved in with his grandmother as a sophomore. (His grandfather had died a few years earlier). He got a part-time job as a cashier, and his grades improved. Vance contemplated college, balked at the price and instead enlisted in the Marines, earning about $1,000 a month after taxes. He served in Iraq and used extra money he won from playing online poker to pay for his grandmother’s health insurance. He also learned how to save money, balance a checkbook and invest. “The Marine Corps,” Vance wrote, “taught me how to live like an adult.” He finished his service in 2007 and enrolled at The Ohio State University. Vance excelled, graduating in less than two years, then went to Yale Law School in 2010. Military service and financial aid helped Vance avoid accruing massive debt—and high-paying gigs at elite law firms during his Yale years helped, too. He graduated in 2013, and today, Vance has no student debt. Equipped with a law degree, Vance and his girlfriend, Yale classmate Usha Chilukuri, both clerked in Cincinnati for a year, then married soon after, changing their last names to “Vance.” The newlyweds moved to Washington D.C., where Usha clerked for then-circuit court judge Brett Kavanaugh and Vance started at a corporate law firm. They purchased a home east of the Capitol building in August 2014 for $590,000, borrowing just over $600,000 to pay for it. The home is worth about $850,000 today, and they owe an estimated $480,000 against it—the only debt they appear to have on their balance sheet. Vance and his wife, Usha, appeared on the floor of the Republican National Convention Monday night, where he was acclaimed Trump's VP nominee. Next, the couple headed to the Left Coast, where Usha started at the San Francisco office of Munger, Tolles and Olson. J.D. pivoted to tech, finding like-minded conservative circles in Silicon Valley. He worked at a biotech outfit, then joined Mithril, a venture capital firm founded by Paypal billionaire Peter Thiel. I n 2016, Vance published “Hillbilly Elegy,” which launched him onto the national stage, turning a poor kid from Ohio into a more genteel spokesperson for the white working class than the rich guy from New York. Vance appeared on CNN and graced the pages of The New York Times, but he didn’t always enjoy his new role, unsettled by his proximity to what he now terms “the liberal establishment.” In 2017, Vance announced that he was moving back to Ohio and starting an organization to fight the opioid epidemic. It didn’t go well. Our Ohio Renewal raised $220,000 in 2017 and spent $45,000 on a survey, $71,000 on salaries and wages, $63,000 on management and $11,000 on advertising and promotions. His wife, meanwhile, left her law firm in 2017 to clerk for Chief Justice John Roberts, then returned to private practice in D.C. at the same firm. J.D. pivoted back to startups, joining AOL billionaire Steve Case in his efforts to invest in VC-starved Middle America. In 2018, Vance and his wife bought a $1.4 million home in Cincinnati’s left-leaning East Walnut Hills—his neighborhood voted for Joe Biden in 2020 by 40 points. Forbes estimates that the house, now owned by an LLC, is worth about $1.8 million. Online listings say the property contains 5 bedrooms and 4,700 square feet, offering plenty of room for Vance, his wife and their three kids. A year after buying the Cincinnati home, Vance started his own venture firm, Narya. His investments hinted at his political inclinations. He bet on Rumble, a right-leaning YouTube competitor that now serves as a key partner to Trump’s Truth Social platform. His firm also invested in Strive Asset Management, the fund provider that former presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, another Ohioan, founded to take on the likes of BlackRock and Vanguard. By 2021, with somewhere between $3 million and $10 million of venture holdings and liquid assets, Vance moved on to a new challenge, politics. Thiel, his old venture partner, seeded a U.S. Senate run with $10 million, then pitched in another $5 million as the race heated up. Other billionaires who had crossed paths with Vance in the business world declined to donate anything. Something had changed about Vance. Once a “never-Trump” Republican, he began bowing down to the former president, ultimately winning Trump’s endorsement. It was enough to beat former Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan, and Vance stayed loyal to Trump after winning. On Saturday, he blamed Joe Biden for the assassination attempt that nearly killed Trump. As a Senate candidate, Vance leaned hard into right-wing messaging on immigration, Ukraine and support for former president Trump. Vance’s triumphant return to Washington D.C. came with another real estate investment in a blue area—in early 2023, he dropped $1.6 million on a 2,500-square-foot home in Alexandria, Virginia, which voted by huge margins for Biden in 2020. Asked if Vance has friends in the area, one neighbor said, “No, God, no, no,” before noting that Sean Spicer lives nearby. Forbes estimates Vance’s home is worth about $1.8 million today, bringing his total real estate holdings across three homes to around $4 million. He may not need the house in Virginia for long. If Vance becomes vice president, as polls currently suggest he will, he and his family will be able to move into the Naval Observatory, the official vice presidential residence, 10 minutes from the White House and hundreds of miles from hillbilly country.

Title: For investors, does it matter who wins the US election?

Larry Fink of BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, is “tired of hearing this is the biggest election in your lifetime”. The reality, says Fink, “is over time it doesn’t matter”. Is he right? Ordinarily, yes. With stock returns, there are many more important factors than politics. Stocks usually rise no matter who is in power, so professionals routinely advise investors not to fret about politics. Some republicans believed Obama would be terrible for stocks. Some Democrats panicked when Trump was elected in 2016. Nevertheless, stocks rose in both instances. As Dimensional Fund Advisors founder David Bloom notes, “shareholders are investing in companies, not in politicians”. Stocks may well rise significantly during a second Trump administration, and many on Wall Street are enthused about possible corporate tax cuts and deregulation. Nevertheless, Fink’s nonchalance is misplaced. Trump is no ordinary politician. Tariffs, trade wars, huge budget deficits, increased inflation expectations, further deglobalisation, mass deportations – one sees why 23 Nobel economists recently penned a letter endorsing Kamala Harris. Worse, Trump’s authoritarian instincts are deeply problematic. As Financial Times columnist Martin Wolf warns, Trump “is at the very least ‘fascistic’ and can be credibly called a fascist”. Autocracy is not good for investors, with research showing a strong link between democracy and stock returns. Capitalism relies on independent courts and institutions to ensure fair rules and support a stable market environment. Replacing civil servants with political appointees could endanger reliable reporting of economic data. Additionally, investors should be alarmed by Trump’s desire to end the Federal Reserve’s independence and give the president influence over rate policy. Now, some argue Trump’s bark is worse than his bite. Even if there is institutional erosion, it might unfold slowly, so stocks may do just fine under a Trump presidency. A bad president can still be good for stocks. Still, ignoring political risks may no longer be wise; healthy markets require healthy democratic institutions.

Almost a year in, Niall Davidson has settled into his Canal Docks location. A new casual bar and bottle shop has just opened and there are plans for a test kitchen, which is an indication of where his ambitions lie. The food is as spectacular as ever, with freshly landed fish, seafood, pork chops and hunks of beef from six-year old ex-dairy cows cooked over a custom-built Rhys Allen levitation grill. Corinna Hardgrave Andra Bhavan has branched out to Abbey Street with its extensive menu of southern Indian dishes and it now has Ireland’s first South Indian cocktail bar. The menu stretches from breakfast-style dosas, idlis, and vadas to heartier fare as the day moves on, such as mixed thali platters, Gutti Vankaya curry, lamb Chettinadu, and birianis. If you know the Marlborough Street original, expect much of the same, with the bonus of cocktails. CH Gaz Smith has built a reputation for seafood and steak that few can rival. His dedication to delivering the freshest seafood extends to rising at the crack of dawn to get the catch direct from local boats, and on busy days, the contents of their indulgent seafood platters can change three to four times. With steaks from Hannan’s, and an extensive wine list, Big Mike’s is a spot for celebrations big and small. Joanne Cronin Foxrock locals are lucky to have this spot, run by Alan and Elaine Wang. Start with Castletownbere crab on sourdough or pan-fried scallops, and move on to the decadent shellfish risotto. The 45-day dry-aged rib-eye steak, paired with crispy onions and a rich Béarnaise, and sole on the bone are cooked with pinpoint precision. The well-priced wine list rounds off the experience. CH A long-established fixture in Ireland’s Chinese restaurant scene, China Sichuan offers elevated Sichuan cooking in comfortable surroundings. Second-generation owner Kevin Hui and his team of classically trained chefs have developed a menu that combines the best of Sichuan flavours with Irish ingredients. Look out for beef tenderloin with black pepper and merlot, Sichuan favourite dan-dan noodles or delightful luóbo gao (crispy turnip cubes). JC Aishling Moore is one of the sharpest culinary talents in the country, her cooking driven by a “whole catch” philosophy that keeps things exciting and unpredictable. Much of her menu depends on what the day boats haul in, allowing her to flex her creative muscles on the fly. Her approach to flavour is as agile as it is bold, starting with Rossmore oysters topped with elderflower vinegar granita, and moving on to larger plates such as pan-roasted hake, paired with tomatillo kakut and a punchy beetroot acchar. CH Gursha operates as a supper club with a €29.90 tasting menu, so you’ll need to book and pay in advance. Prepared by Ethiopian native Yagerenesh Tadesse, (known to all as Mamay), her slow-cooked, berbere-spiced dishes, brimming with onions and chillies, are mostly vegetarian and served family-style on vast platters of injera, the tangy fermented bread made from teff. The food is bold, hearty and shared. Their next big project is brewing Ethiopian honey wine (mead), which is still in the experimental phase. CH Eric Mathews’ and Richie Barrett’s restaurant exploded on to the scene a year ago, making an immediate impact with its fiery cooking and bold flavours. The menu jumps from light bites to sharing plates, with pasta and meats kissed by flames. The potato focaccia with carbonara butter feels almost criminal in its indulgence, while Matthews’ Irish coffee riff on tiramisu is rich and delicious. It’s brash, unapologetic, and full throttle flavour. CH Kevin Burke’s restaurant is the kind of place where getting a table feels like winning the lottery – it’s one of the hottest bookings around. It’s a buzzy room with food that is sharp and inventive. Kick off with small plates such as crispy rabbit paired with sauce gribiche, before graduating to heavier hitters such as hamachi belly. Downstairs, a private diningroom for six-to-10 people can be yours with enough advance notice, and a minimum spend to match the experience. CH When chef Gráinne O’Keeffe was seeking to name her first restaurant, it was only natural to name it after her late grandmother Mae. It’s housed above the French Paradox wine shop, O’Keeffe’s seasonal cooking complemented by wine pairings sourced from below. The glorious tarte Tatin and selection of handmade knives have become fixtures, and in good news for locals, she has recently added a Friday lunchtime service. JC When chef Luis Martin took over the former Old Couch Café, he maintained its quirky nature, all the while putting his Spanish stamp on the menu. Bringing experience from his time in the kitchen at three-Michelin-starred restaurant Cenador de Amos, he seamlessly integrates Irish produce into dishes such as rabbit and carrot escabeche or quail and dark chocolate. Plans are under way with a local farmer to grow vegetables for next year’s menus. JC Regardless of whether you are dining during daytime or night-time, the large glass windows at Ox provide a sense of openness to this beautiful, understated room close to the river Lagan. Refurbished in 2023, it is the canvas on which chef Stephen Toman and sommelier Alain Kerloc’h paint their magic. Look out for smoked Ballywalter veal with black garlic or lobster with broad beans and lemon grass. JC Owners Alice Jary and Richard Kennan draw on their vast experience and travels to produce contemporary dishes such as Velvet Cloud labneh and peaches, adorned with glorious green beans and hazelnuts, or flavourful shiitake and tofu dumplings with Szechuan vinegar and roasted seaweed. With bar and restaurant seating, plus a creative cocktail list, and open from lunch to late night, Rúibín is truly a gem in Galway. JC Fidelity Studio is now linked to Fidelity Bar by a sleek interior door, making it easy to drift between the two. Sister 7′s menu, a collab with Big Fan, features dumplings, bao and inventive sharing plates. Don’t skip the “lip sticks”, deep-fried vegetable cakes of fermented rice, celeriac, yam and tofu. DJs spin tunes from a bright orange booth, keeping the energy alive as the night rolls on. CH The Dunmore is a space built for celebrations – dramatic, lively and perfect for catching up with friends over fresh seafood and sizzling dishes from the charcoal-burning oven. Midweek, the early-evening menu – two/three courses for €29/€35 – is particularly good value, with Duncannon mussels, seafood pie, fire-roasted chicken and a Pat McLoughlin beef burger featuring. For larger groups, the mezzanine is your spot, hosting up to 20 people. CH Knockranny has taken a more laid-back approach with the rebranding of La Fougère into The Fern Grill, now focused on relaxed dining, local ingredients and a new cocktail counter. Head chef Seamus Commons fires up daily catches, dry-aged Irish Black Angus, and lamb on the Josper Basque charcoal grill. Choose from the a la carte or the €55, five-course Taste of Knockranny menu. CH Owner and chef Brian Murray describes his style as “cooked with grá and kissed with a little fire”. Since returning to his native city, he has transformed the former Old Thompsons Bakery building into a modern, stylish restaurant. The menus change regularly, offering dishes of black sole with surf clams or Fitzgerald’s lamb served family style. JC The Tannery has become synonymous with modern Irish cooking, combining a cookery school and elegant town house accommodation with Paul and Máire Flynn’s famous restaurant. Chef Damien Derwin has shouldered Paul’s legacy, maintaining the tradition of hearty and creative food made with local ingredients. The revamped website now makes it easier than ever to book an overnight B&B stay with dinner. JC Having spent many years travelling the world and working at Belfast’s Yugo, chef Sean Lafferty opened Umi to share his love for Asian flavours. Umi has a vibrant atmosphere that seamlessly reflects the creative food including binchotan grilled Wagyu steak, and crispy dumplings made with local pork and chilli nut oil. They even offer their own wine, Rainbow Pie, a fresh Austrian Blaufränkisch made by ex-employee Jack Mcateer, with plans to add a white wine. JC Morgan VanderKamer, president of the Irish Guild of Sommeliers, co-owns this Waterford spot, so the wine list is exceptional. Her partner, Stephen McArdle, ensures the food is equally impressive. The menu focuses on wild fish and seasonal ingredients, with dishes such as Kilmore Quay crab with pickled cucumber, free-range pork terrine with foie gras, and roasted monkfish with smoked almond romesco and fennel.

We write helpful technology guides, unbiased product reviews, and report on the latest tech and crypto news. We maintain editorial independence and consider content quality and factual accuracy to be non-negotiable. Eastern Europe has recorded increased crypto adoption, with DeFi transactions as the key driver. The region received more than $499 billion worth of crypto assets between July 2023 and June this year. Moreover, Eastern Europe contributes over 11% of the total crypto value worldwide and ranks as the fourth-largest global crypto market. Eastern Europe has recorded significant growth in its crypto adoption within the past few months. In a recent report, on-chain analytics company Chainalysis indicated the region received about $499.14 billion between July 2023 and June 2024. Further, the report revealed that the region now ranks globally as the fourth-largest crypto market. Its digital assets activity accounted for 11% of the cumulative global inflows within the period under analysis. In detail, decentralized finance (DeFi) activity within Eastern Europe saw a remarkable surge. The region recorded over $165 billion of DeFi-related transactions, representing a third of its total crypto deals within the period. Amid the events of war and turbulence within the region, DeFi activity grew by almost 40% in Eastern Europe. Moreover, decentralized exchanges (DEXes) witnessed more inflows, especially from Russia, Ukraine, Poland, and Belarus. These positive indications placed Eastern Europe third in global DeFi adoption, only behind Latin America and Sub-Africa. Amid the growing DeFi engagement, centralized exchanges (CEXs) still dominate crypto activity within the region. The report indicated that the CEXs received more than $324 billion in crypto asset transactions. Russia and Ukraine pioneer crypto adoption and growth within Eastern Europe with remarkable crypto transaction volumes amid their ongoing war and turbulent events. According to Chainalysis, Russia recorded over $182 billion in crypto assets flows to emerge at the top. Ukraine trails in the second position, with transaction flows amounting to more than $106 billion. Also, DEXs in Russia and Ukraine posted inflows growth of over 173% and 160%, respectively. Meanwhile, the Chainalysis report indicated that Ukraine and Russia ranked sixth and seventh in the 2024 global crypto adoption index. Ukraine made the most drive in the market’s activity in institutional and professional transfers. The country’s prominent activity came from large institutional transfers of over $10 million and mid-sized institutional transfers between $1 million and $10 million. A leading CEX in Ukraine, WhiteBIT, acknowledged the positive overturn of crypto transactions. WhiteBIT told Chainalysis: “Institutional and professional crypto transfers in Ukraine have surged as many seek financial stability amid the ongoing war, with cryptocurrencies viewed as a safer alternative.” Also, WhiteBIt highlighted certain factors that fueled the spike in crypto adoption and transfers in the country. These include inflation, market volatility, war-related sanctions, and the increasing institutional attraction in Bitcoin ETFs from issuers like BlackRock. Citing order book data, the Chainalysis report also noted that Bitcoin acquisition via the Ukraine hryvnia surged drastically over the past year, above $882 million. This trend reflects that Ukrainians have potentially adopted Bitcoin as a reliable store of value and inflation hedge.
