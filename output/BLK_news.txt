Crypto is reportedly becoming more integrated into the conventional banking system, according to the Wall Street Journal. This shift occurs after the regulatory crackdown that followed the failure of crypto exchange FTX and its aftermath for many crypto-friendly institutions caused many in the conventional financial sector to withdraw their support from the digital asset market. But now, with Trump’s recent vow to make America a “Bitcoin superpower,” things might be starting to change, the report alleges, and more integration between crypto and conventional banking could be on the horizon. Several crypto firms, including Circle and BitGo, are reportedly planning to apply for banking charters or licenses. Notably, Coinbase Global and the stablecoin company Paxos are also considering similar steps. As reported by Bitcoinist, the Trump administration aims to mainstream crypto finances, as such, Congress is advancing legislation that would create a regulatory framework for stablecoins. These proposed regulations would require stablecoin issuers to obtain charters or licenses from regulators, a move that could fundamentally change the operational dynamics of the digital asset market. Many firms are exploring options for national trust or industrial bank charters, which would allow them to function similarly to conventional banks by accepting deposits and making loans. Others are reportedly pursuing more specialized licenses that would enable them to issue stablecoins. Any firm that secures a banking charter will face stricter oversight, a reality that has been vividly illustrated by Anchorage Digital, the only digital asset firm in the US to hold a federal bank charter. CEO Nathan McCauley told the Wall Street Journal that the company has invested tens of millions of dollars to meet regulatory obligations, which include stringent anti-money-laundering measures. Anchorage’s recent partnership with major financial players, including BlackRock and Cantor Fitzgerald, underscores the growing acceptance of digital assets within mainstream finance. Just a few years ago, major banks severed ties with crypto firms amid a wave of regulatory scrutiny following the FTX incident. The fallout from the collapse of Silvergate Capital and Signature Bank left many crypto entrepreneurs struggling to find banking partners willing to accept their deposits or provide loans. However, the political climate is shifting, and under Trump’s administration, regulators have begun to relax restrictions that previously required banks to obtain approval for crypto-related activities. New guidance on how banks can engage with crypto is anticipated later this year. Some banks are eager to catch up and establish partnerships within the crypto space. For instance, Bank of America’s CEO Brian Moynihan expressed interest in issuing a stablecoin, contingent upon a solid legal framework. Similarly, US Bancorp recently announced plans to relaunch its digital asset custody service in collaboration with NYDIG, a Bitcoin trading and banking firm. Conversely, some banks remain cautious. KeyCorp’s CEO Chris Gorman acknowledged the potential risks posed by digital assets, viewing them as both an opportunity and a competitive threat. Gorman emphasized the importance of understanding the evolving regulatory landscape, particularly concerning anti-money-laundering safeguards.

Title: Gerry Thornley: Leinster’s success masking alarming fault lines which have emerged in Irish rugby

On the surface, all seems hunky dory. The Ireland men’s team are ranked third in the world, the ever-improving women’s side are ranked fifth and Leinster are one more home semi-final win away from becoming the first side ever to reach four successive Champions Cup finals. Scratch underneath, though, and the gap between Leinster and the other three provinces has never been bigger, nor more alarming. For sure, there is nothing particularly new in Leinster being the last Irish team standing in Europe. They have been the only Irish team in the semi-final stages of the Champions Cup for six seasons in a row now, while Ulster haven’t been in a final for 13 years and Munster for 17 seasons. However, it’s not just that the other three provinces are so far away from dining at European rugby’s top table, it’s that there is no sign of this changing any time soon. Furthermore, take the URC, a competition which the Irish teams used to routinely dominate. Two seasons ago, Leinster, Ulster, Munster and Connacht all reached the playoffs. The latter three, on average, had a 61 per cent winning ratio that season. This season, as things stand, Munster, Ulster and Connacht have all lost more matches than they have won. Between them, the trio’s winning ratio has dropped to 42 per cent. Munster sit seventh, Ulster 10th and Connacht 12th, and there is a real possibility that Leinster might be the only Irish team in the playoffs and hence the only Irish team in next season’s Champions Cup, with the other three consigned to the Challenge Cup. It shouldn’t come to that. The others are still in the mix, but then again it might come to that. This cannot be solely attributable to the arrival of the South African teams. After all, they were there two seasons ago. Throw in the provinces’ respective Champions Cup and Challenge Cup games this season and whereas Leinster’s winning ratio is 95 per cent, for the three others combined this figure is 45 per cent. This is truly alarming. But then again this is the inevitable byproduct of the increasing centralisation of the Irish system and its focus on international teams, be they 15s or Sevens, during the tenure of David Nucifora as the IRFU performance director. And it could take many years to rectify the problem. The IRFU invest equally in the pathways of all four provinces but they are not receiving much in return from Munster, Ulster and Connacht, although the Union’s focus on Provincial Talent Squads and National Talent Squads seems only to have shrunk the base designed to develop international quality players. Next season there will be 14 centrally contracted players, of whom four came from the pathways in New Zealand (Bundee Aki, James Lowe and Jamison Gibson-Park) and Australia (Mack Hansen). Connacht can rightly lay claim to Robbie Henshaw, but the other nine, including Munster’s only centrally contracted player, Tadhg Beirne, came through the Leinster pathway. Not one player came through Munster or Ulster, and the latter do not have one centrally contracted player next season. Last week’s announcement by the IRFU that the provinces are to be responsible for 40 per cent of national player contracts where previously the figure had been set at 30 per cent is a step in the right direction. It is estimated that this will free up around €500-€600,000 for the IRFU to redistribute toward improving the pathways in Connacht, Munster and Ulster. One sincerely hopes that these monies are used to upgrade the yawning gulf in facilities and coaching which exists between the elite rugby-playing schools in Leinster compared to the other three provinces. As well as having this and other socio-economic advantages, true to type Leinster were also quicker out of the blocks in breaking into their own schools. As with the other provinces, schools rugby had been something of an impenetrable sacred cow, but teachers – under heightened pressure academically – don’t have the time for coaching which they once had. So, maybe the other three provinces should stop trying to emulate the Leinster system and focus their energies and player development on their clubs. For it’s hard to see how the Cork, Limerick, Galway and Belfast schools will ever match the facilities and coaching budgets of St Michael’s, Blackrock et al. The IRFU have done many things right, eventually, in the professional era but in investing more heavily on Ireland international teams they have taken their eye off the provinces. And although Team Ireland should be strong for another few years yet, the chickens are already coming home to roost. Remember the 90s? Team Ireland could hardly buy a win. That was partly because the same was true of all four provinces in the early days of professionalism and the European Cup. Then came Ulster’s 1999 European Cup triumph and, in particular, Munster’s emergence in the noughties to reach four finals, winning two of them in 2006 and 2008. This was followed by Leinster’s arrival among European rugby’s true elite, which provided the players with the confidence to establish Ireland as one of the best sides in the world. Viewed in that light, Leinster’s excellence should be celebrated. Where Irish rugby would be without them really doesn’t bear thinking about. That’s why the stellar signings of the last 12 months, and the IRFU sanctioning the arrival of Rieko Ioane, are positives. Leinster winning the Champions Cup would be brilliant for Irish rugby. Rather than close the gap by diluting Leinster in any way, the Union need to strengthen the other three. The restructuring of the Union’s funding model last week is presumably with this ideal in mind and followed ‘a planned review of its funding model’. Hence it had been in the pipeline for a year or so, and it will take many years for it to bear fruit. The likelihood is that much of the investment in Under-20s and Sevens programmes will also be redirected towards the other three provinces. But it is already clear that while this is a step in the right direction, it is most likely a drop in the ocean and not nearly enough to address the underlining and alarming fault lines which have emerged in Irish rugby. gerry.thornley@irishtimes.com Sign up to the Irish Times weekly rugby digest for the view from the press box with Gerry Thornley © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Wall Street Journal: Trump's Less Border Migration Allows More Airport Migration
URL: https://www.breitbart.com/immigration/2025/04/21/wall-street-journal-trumps-less-illegal-migration-allows-more-legalized-migration/
Time Published: 2025-04-22T03:30:36Z

President Donald Trump has successfully stopped the inflow of economic migrants via the southern border, so he should invite more economic migrants via the nation’s airports, says the Wall Street Journal. The political “question is whether Mr. Trump can use the political capital from his border victory to achieve a more lasting immigration success,” the newspaper’s pro-migration editors declared. According to WSJ-owner Rupert Murdoch’s editors, Trump’s “opportunity” for “immigration success” should: include more pathways for legal immigration to address the labor needs of a growing economy. Half of small businesses say one of their largest problems is finding workers. If Mr. Trump wants more fruits and vegetables grown at home, who’s going to pick them? … If Mr. Trump wants Silicon Valley to win the AI race, why are H-1B skilled visas capped at a low number and handed out by lottery? The newspaper’s illegal=bad/legal=good message comes as Trump’s deputies are charting a course back to a lower-migration, high-productivity United States, away from the post-1990 cheap-labor economy that transfers ordinary Americans’ wages into profits for quarterly CEOs and Wall Street investors. The promise of cheap labor is “a drug that too many American firms got addicted to … [and] cheap labor is a problem precisely because it’s been bad for innovation,” Vice President JD Vance told his audience of investors in March: Real innovation makes us more productive, but it also, I think, dignifies our workers. It boosts our standard of living. It strengthens our workforce and the relative value of its labor. Breitbart News has posted many articles about migration’s harmful impact on productivity and innovation — and also how tight labor markets help pressure companies to invest in wage-boosting automation and productivity. In the white-collar sector, Breitbart News has shown how visa programs created by Congress and executives — such as the H-1B, J-1, L-1, CPT, and other visa programs — have imported debilitating Indian-style office politics into a wide range of critical U.S. companies, including Intel, IBM, Twitter, and Boeing. The damage was recently spotlighted by Citibank, which announced it would sharply reduce its reliance on foreign contractors after the contractors cost the company at least $600 million in routine operations and regulatory incompetence. The decision means Citibank will begin hiring at least 10,000 American technology professionals for jobs held by supposedly cheaper Indian visa workers. The economic damage of migration has been noted by some business leaders who face competing temptations to either raise short-term profit via migration or raise long-term productivity and innovation via investment in American employees. “I can argue, in the developed countries, the big winners are the countries that have shrinking populations,” BlackRock founder Larry Fink said at a 2024 pro-globalist event hosted by the World Economic Forum in Saudi Arabia. He continued: That’s something that most people never talked about. We always used to think [a] shrinking population is a cause for negative [economic] growth. But in my conversations with the leadership of these large, developed countries [such as China, and Japan] that have xenophobic anti-immigration policies, they don’t allow anybody to come in — [so they have] shrinking demographics — these countries will rapidly develop robotics and AI and technology … “If a promise of all that transforms productivity, which most of us think it will [emphasis added] — we’ll be able to elevate the standard of living in countries, the standard of living for individuals, even with shrinking populations,” Fink said.

Title: Wall Street and the dollar tumble as investors retreat further from the United States

WEATHER ALERT Elaine Kurtenbach Associated Press Published: April 20, 2025 at 9:56 PM Updated: April 21, 2025 at 4:16 PM Elaine Kurtenbach Associated Press Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All rights reserved Trader Sal Suarino works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, Monday, April 21, 2025. (AP Photo/Richard Drew) Wall Street weakened Monday as investors worldwide get more skeptical about U.S. investments because of President Donald Trump’s trade war and his criticism of the Federal Reserve, which are shaking the traditional order. The S&P 500 sank 2.4% in another wipeout. That yanked the index that’s at the center of many 401(k) accounts 16% below its record set two months ago. Recommended Videos The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 971 points, or 2.5%, while losses for Tesla and Nvidia helped drag the Nasdaq composite down 2.6%. Perhaps more worryingly, U.S. government bonds and the value of the U.S. dollar also sank as prices retreated across U.S. markets. It’s an unusual move because Treasurys and the dollar have historically strengthened during episodes of nervousness. This time around, though, it’s policies directly from Washington that are causing the fear and potentially weakening their reputations as some of the world’s safest investments. Trump continued his tough talk on global trade as economists and investors continue to say his stiff proposed tariffs could cause a recession if they’re not rolled back. U.S. talks last week with Japan failed to reach a quick deal that could lower tariffs and protect the economy, and they’re seen as a “test case,” according to Thierry Wizman, a strategist at Macquarie. “The golden rule of negotiating and success: He who has the gold makes the rules,” Trump said in all capitalized letters on his Truth Social Network. He also said that “the businessmen who criticize tariffs are bad at business, but really bad at politics,” likewise in all caps. Trump has recently focused more on China, the world’s second-largest economy, which has also been keeping up its rhetoric. China on Monday warned other countries against making trade deals with the United States “at the expense of China’s interest” as Japan, South Korea and others try to negotiate agreements. “If this happens, China will never accept it and will resolutely take countermeasures in a reciprocal manner,” China’s Commerce Ministry said in a statement. Also hanging over the market are worries about Trump’s anger at Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Trump last week criticized Powell again for not cutting interest rates sooner to give the economy more juice. The Fed has been resistant to lowering rates too quickly because it does not want to allow inflation to reaccelerate after slowing nearly all the way down to its 2% goal from more than 9% three years ago. Trump talked Monday about a slowdown for the U.S. economy that could be coming unless “Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.” A move by Trump to fire Powell would likely send a bolt of fear through financial markets. While Wall Street loves lower rates, largely because they boost stock prices, the bigger worry would be that a less independent Fed would be less effective at keeping inflation under control. Such a move could further weaken, if not kill, the United States’ reputation as the world’s safest place to keep cash. All the uncertainty striking pillars at the center of financial markets means some investors say they’re having to rethink the fundamentals of how to invest. “We can no longer extrapolate from past trends or rely on long-term assumptions to anchor portfolios,” strategists at BlackRock Investment Institute said in a report. “The distinction between tactical and strategic asset allocation is blurred. Instead, we need to constantly reassess the long-term trajectory and be dynamic with asset allocation as we learn more about the future state of the global system.” That in turn could push investors outside the United States to keep more of their money in their home markets, according to the strategists led by Jean Boivin. On Wall Street, Big Tech stocks helped lead indexes lower ahead of their latest earnings reports due later this week. Tesla sank 5.7%. The electric vehicle maker’s stock has more than halved from its record set in December on criticism that the stock price had gone too high and that CEO Elon Musk’s role in leading the U.S. government’s efforts to cut spending is damaging the brand. Nvidia fell 4.5% for a third straight drop after disclosing that U.S. export limits on chips to China could hurt its first-quarter results by $5.5 billion. They led another wipeout on Wall Street, and 92% of the stocks within the S&P 500 fell. Among the few gainers were Discover Financial Services and Capital One Financial, which climbed after the U.S. government approved their proposed merger. Discover rose 3.6%, while Capital One added 1.5%. All told, the S&P 500 fell 124.50 points to 5,158.20. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 971.82 to 38,170.41, and the Nasdaq composite tumbled 415.55 to 15,870.90. Gold also climbed to burnish its reputation as a safe-haven investment, unlike some others. In the bond market, shorter-term Treasury yields fell as investors expect the Fed to cut its main overnight interest rate later this year to support the economy. But longer-term yields rose with doubts about the United States’ standing in the global economy. The yield on the 10-year Treasury climbed to 4.40%, up from 4.34% at the end of last week and from just about 4% earlier this month. That’s a substantial move for the bond market. The U.S. dollar’s value, meanwhile, fell against the euro, Japanese yen, the Swiss franc and other currencies. ___ AP Business Writer Elaine Kurtenbach contributed.

Key Points Direct Answer What Tether DoesTether is the company behind USDT, a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar, meaning each USDT is supposed to be backed by an equivalent amount in reserves like cash or assets. How Tether Makes MoneyTether likely makes money in a few main ways, though the exact details can be complex: Controversy and UncertaintyThere’s debate about how transparent Tether is with its reserves, with past issues like fines for not maintaining full reserves, which might affect trust in its reported profits. For 2024, it reported $5.2 billion in profit for the first half, but exact figures can vary (Wikipedia – Tether). What is Omni and What Are Some Interesting Use Cases of It: A Comprehensive Analysis This note provides a detailed examination of how Tether makes money, exploring its business model, revenue streams, and the controversies surrounding its operations. It builds on the initial overview, offering a thorough analysis for readers seeking a deeper understanding, current as of 7:12 PM PDT on Monday, April 21, 2025. Introduction to Tether and Its Business Model Tether is the company behind USDT, a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar in a 1:1 ratio, meaning each USDT in circulation is theoretically backed by an equivalent amount of US dollars or other assets held in reserves. Launched in 2014, Tether has become one of the largest stablecoins by market capitalization, with a reported value of nearly $99 billion as of March 2024 (Investopedia – Tether (USDT)). Its primary function is to provide stability to crypto traders and investors by offering a digital asset that mirrors the value of fiat currency, facilitating transfers between cryptocurrency markets and traditional financial systems. The question of how Tether makes money is nuanced, as it operates in a controversial space with regulatory scrutiny and transparency issues. This note explores its revenue generation mechanisms, drawing on recent research and examples from 2024 and early 2025. Tether’s Revenue Streams Tether generates revenue through several key mechanisms, leveraging its role as a stablecoin issuer and its management of reserves. Below are the primary ways Tether makes money, supported by recent data and examples: Controversies and Transparency Issues Tether’s revenue generation has been controversial, particularly around the transparency and management of its reserves. Research suggests several issues that impact trust in its profitability claims: These controversies suggest that while Tether reports significant profits, the exact mechanisms and transparency of its revenue generation remain debated, affecting trust among investors and regulators. Comparative Analysis with Other Stablecoins Research, such as Forbes Advisor – What Is Tether?, indicates that other stablecoins like USD Coin (USDC) and Dai (DAI) also generate revenue through interest on reserves, but Tether’s scale and strategic investments set it apart. Its ability to hold over $97.6 billion in Treasuries and report $5.2 billion in profit for H1 2024 highlights its dominant position, though regulatory scrutiny remains higher due to past issues. Practical Examples and Adoption Despite controversies, Tether’s revenue model has driven significant adoption: Risks and Challenges Tether’s revenue generation faces challenges: Conclusion Research suggests Tether makes money primarily through interest on its reserves, especially U.S. Treasury securities, investment profits from assets like gold and bitcoin, and strategic investments in companies like Blackrock Neutro and Rumble. It may also earn from transaction and issuance fees, though this is likely smaller. However, controversies around reserve transparency, like past CFTC fines and debates over profit reporting, highlight the complexity and debate surrounding its revenue model. This analysis, current as of April 21, 2025, underscores Tether’s significant profitability, balancing its role as a stablecoin with regulatory and trust challenges.

Title: Report: New Valuation Push for Elon Musk’s xAI

After spending much of his time and energy this year as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), could Elon Musk be pivoting to refocus on his businesses? Sources familiar with an xAI investor call last week told CNBC Monday (April 21) that Musk was on the call and is seeking to establish a “proper valuation” for his artificial intelligence (AI) startup. Although Musk, who was a co-founder of AI pioneer OpenAI, did not formally announce a capital funding round for xAI, the sources for the CNBC report think that is coming soon. The sources also said a $1 billion potential run rate figure was mentioned on the call. CNBC said the investor call took place just months after reports that xAI was seeking to secure up to $6 billion at a $50 billion valuation, with the funding reportedly coming from Middle Eastern sovereign wealth funds and backing from global investors. That capital was earmarked for acquiring 100,000 Nvidia chips, CNBC said, a key component in the company’s AI infrastructure. xAI recently merged with the Musk-owned social media platform X in an all-stock deal. PYMNTS reported that he valued xAI at $80 billion and X at $33 billion. Founded in July 2023, xAI launched the chatbot Grok last year to compete with other leading AI chatbots, including Anthropic’s Claude and OpenAI’s ChatGPT. The CNBC report said that at the time, xAI touted that Grok’s real-time internet knowledge enabled it to launch with just two months of training. PYMNTS reported in March that xAI and Nvidia joined a $30 billion AI Infrastructure Partnership backed by BlackRock, Microsoft, and Abu Dhabi AI investment group MGX, with the ultimate goal to raise up to $100 billion for AI development. The partnership aims to build the next generation of AI-ready data centers and support the escalating demands of generative AI models. The CNBC report also noted that Tesla, where Musk is CEO, experienced a 40% decline in shares this year and could raise questions about his management bandwidth.

Title: First XV rugby: Tauranga’s storming preseason; St Kentigern win another Quadrangular, 2024 global school rankings, Hamilton’s Sanix Tournament opponents
URL: https://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/rugby/school-rugby/first-xv-rugby-taurangas-storming-preseason-st-kentigern-win-another-quadrangular-2024-global-school-rankings-hamiltons-sanix-tournament-opponents/H3HQP6WIXNBU3LFNB5PU3V5D2M/
Time Published: 2025-04-21T21:06:03Z

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. Tauranga Boys’ College have hit the ground running in 2025, despite having a relatively new First XV rugby team with only seven returnees from last season. The defending Super 8 champions have amassed 169 points in four consecutive pre-season victories and there was more than a hint of excitement about some of their players when, in a rare visit to the capital on Saturday, Tauranga topped Wellington College 45-31. And that was without co-captains Jay McQuoid and Ethan McManemin, who were sidelined with concussion stand-downs. It’s been a tough 2025 rebuild for Tauranga coach Aidan Kuka. In 2024, he could call upon the New Zealand Secondary Schools starting halfback-first five combination of Charlie Sinton and Mason Verster, who have now left. But he’s hoping lessons from their time remain, particularly for new first five-eighths Ivan Ward. “Charlie and Mason worked really hard to promote themselves and create a competitive environment for the team last year,” Kuka said. “The challenge for this year’s group is to build that again. “I don’t think I can replicate talented players as coach – individuals have to understand who they are as a player. “But Ivan had a front-row seat last year to what a good 9 or 10 should look like – how they pushed each other, how they prepared and recovered, how they guided the team, and has learned off them.” In pleasantly autumnal conditions, the Wellington-Tauranga match was a vibrant spectacle between two sides expected to be leading contenders in their respective competitions. Wellington gained a brief ascendancy before the interval. Tauranga lock Blake Vrieze was sin-binned and the hosts flipped a 19-12 deficit into a 24-19 advantage with tries to prop Harry Baddington and No 8 Z’Kdeus Schwalger – without his formerly captivating Afro but no less unmistakable with his rigorous athleticism. But the biggest drawcard was Tommy McQuoid. The Tauranga fullback bagged four tries, a feat almost unheard of by visitors to the forebodingly nicknamed “Graveyard”. (It’s likely Hurricanes winger Kini Naholo holds the record for most tries in any game against Wellington College. In 2017, he scored five tries in a 78-0 win for the eventual National Top Four champions, Hastings Boys’ High.) McQuoid was rugby ethereal, moving so light and rapidly on his feet it seemed he could reject the BOP Steamers Academy for K-pop. Early in the second half, McQuoid latched on to an errant pass and sprinted 80m to complete his hat-trick. Kuka described McQuoid as an exciting prospect promoted from last year’s Tauranga Under-15s. “Opponents underestimate his power,” Kuka said. “He doesn’t look like a strapping athlete, but in contact he has the ability to wriggle out of a tackle. “And he is extremely fast. There is no substitute for speed. He also has a nose for space, an instinct. He is a special player.” A conversion followed from the assured Ward, and the Tauranga Titans didn’t relinquish the lead again. Indeed, Wellington began to implode, conceding a raft of penalties and three successive tries. Hooker Zach Horan, whose dad Sean helps coach Evans Bay-based Marist St Pat’s, rumbled over from a maul. Winger Malachi Emmett regathered a chip-and-chase for a second time, and McQuoid completed his quartet with a 30m surge. Tommy McQuoid’s dad, Grant McQuoid, played 50 games for Bay of Plenty, winning the Ranfurly Shield in 2004 and representing the All Blacks Sevens, while brother Jay is also highly regarded. “Jay’s an abrasive No 7,” Kuka said. “A ‘follow-me’ type of leader who is always full steam ahead.” Except for kickoff receipts (a headache for Tauranga too), there’s a lot to like about Wellington College and they regrouped from 45-24 down to score the last try. “We don’t seem to have a problem in scoring, but I’m more concerned about our defence,” Kuka reflected. Wellington’s mammoth prop, Julius Toimata, had a conspicuous impact. In his third season, first five-eighths Archie Sims offers variety and stability. Centre Narvin Campbell breached the defence more than once. Openside Connor “Notorious” Gregor was all heart. “They were tough,” Kuka said of Wellington. “Some really good players there.” Tauranga now host Auckland Grammar at noon on Saturday. Grammar are reluctant to publicise their First XV rugby these days, but have won all their pre-season matches to date, including a 28-19 away victory over Palmerston North Boys’ High, after leading 17-14 at halftime. Tauranga Boys’ College pre-season: bt Dilworth 36-33, bt Wesley 45-7, bt St John’s (Hamilton) 43-10, bt Wellington College 45-31. In its 2024 Global Top 20 first XV school rankings, the UK-based nextgen.com (Ireland) website selected Tauranga Boys’ College as the third-best behind Paul Roos (South Africa) and Irerland’s Blackrock College. Hamilton Boys’ High were fifth (up from 11th in 2023), Nelson College were 10th (unranked in 2023), St Kentigern were 13th (same as 2023) and Feilding High were a new entrant at 16. But there was no place for Kelston Boys’ High, Blues champions and World Schools Rugby Festival winners (and, incidentally, conquerors of Paul Roos) in Abu Dhabi in December. Nextgen.com 2024 Global rankings: 1.) Paul Roos (South Africa); 2.) Blackrock College (Ireland); 3.) Tauranga Boys’ College (NZ); 4.) Nudgee College (Australia); 5.) Hamilton Boys’ High (NZ); 6.) St Michaels (Ireland); 7.) Paarl Gim (South Africa); 8.) Clifton College (England); 9.) Grey College (South Africa); 10.) Nelson College (NZ); 11.) Millfield (England); 12.) Affies (South Africa); 13.) St Kentigern (NZ); 14.) Sedbergh (England); 15.) Barker College (Australia); 16.) Feilding High (NZ); 17.) Paarl Boys (South Africa); 18.) Shore (Australia); 19.) Cranleigh (England); 20.) Llandovery (Wales). There was little surprise when St Kentigern College defeated St Andrew’s College 39-12 in the final of the Presbyterian Schools Quadrangular Tournament. The Pakūranga powerhouses have won the event on 10 consecutive occasions and 23 times since its inception in 1989. But those who attended the third-place playoff would have been gobsmacked by the outcome of that fixture, as tournament hosts Lindisfarne College embarrassed their longest and fiercest rivals, Scots College, 98-19. Lindisfarne opened in 1953 and have jousted with Scots in various sporting codes since. Since 2014, Scots have won the Wellington Premiership five times and were semifinalists in 2024. Comparatively, Lindisfarne have struggled, making the semifinals of the Central North Island series only twice since 2016. In the unprecedented rout, Lindisfarne scored 14 tries, with Noah Rogers scoring two and kicking nine conversions for an individual haul of 28 points. That beats the 24 points future Rugby World Cup-winning fullback Israel Dagg scored in Lindisfarne’s 24-0 whitewash of Scots in 2005. Te Awarangi Puketapu Pene (3), Fletcher McKay (2) and Charlie East (2) were also multiple try-scorers for Lindisfarne, who have also beaten Super 8 sides Gisborne Boys’ High (27-26) and Palmerston North Boys’ High (34-15) in pre-season. Ironically, Lindisfarne are coached by Andre Bell who guided Scots to the 2023 Wellington Premiership and a 61-26 thumping of Lindisfarne that season. A further dive into the history books reveals Bell attended Lindisfarne. In 1988, he captained a First XV that beat Scots 40-9 and Taradale High School 113-0. In that game, Bell scored 57 points (7 tries, 13 conversions, penalty) in an era when tries were worth only four points. What to make of Scots? Former All Black Dominic Bird is director of rugby with support from Hurricanes Poua head coach Fusi Feaunati. Scots lost by a combined five points to the 2024 finalists, but depth proved to be an issue and remains a challenge with a Second XV that has been in Premier Four. Premier divisions in Wellington typically have 10 teams. Quad Summary: St Kentigern College 43 Lindisfarne College 7. St Andrew’s College 69 Scots College 17. Third playoff: Lindisfarne College 98 Scots College 19. Final: St Kentigern College 39 St Andrew’s College 12. Tournament MVPs: Lindisfarne: Charlie East Scots: Brandon Lo St Andrew’s: Caleb Collins-Polata Saint Kentigern: Siale Pahulu Hamilton Boys High will face three Japanese schools in pool play at the Sanix World Rugby Youth Tournament in Fukuoka, Japan, from April 28-May 5: Tokai University Sagami High (Kanagawa), Gose Industrial High School (Nara) and Nagasaki Hokuyodai High School (Nagasaki). Other international entrants in the 24-team tournament are Barker College (Australia), Chien Kuo High (Chinese Taipei), SGS Filton College (England), Ratu Kadavulevu School (Fiji), and Paichai High School (Korea). Meanwhile Howick College are contesting the eight-team girls sevens at the Sanix tournament, facing defending champions Fukuoka Rugby Football Club, Reitaku High School (Chiba, Japan) and Hong Kong China Junior Dragons in pool play. Hamilton Boys’ High School First XV squad for the Sanix tournament: Liam Van Der Heyden, Noah Walker, Dion Fifita, Bailey Dent, Masami Kawai, Ryan Ralph, Caleb Puamau, Hunter Hammond, Corban Dunlop, Caleb Grice, Kent Mills, Tom Foote, Campbell Bushell, Aiden Saxon, George Roose, Lachlan Ross, Hakopa Paringatai, Jackson Botherway, Maxwell Kara, Miller Sturm, Toby Wales, Ollie Guerin, Cullen Parai, Koewyn Kearins-Te Whare, Carson Hunter, Nathan Stephens, Liam De Har-Elliott. Henderson’s Liston College continue to catch the eye in pre-season, with their latest effort being a 33-26 away win over Nelson College, last year’s National Top Four runners-up. With a school roll of just 845, Liston finished seventh in Auckland’s 1A competition in 2023, and 10th in 2022, but could be heading for a higher placing in 2025. Meanwhile Nelson have a new first XV coaching line-up this year. Greg Foe, the college’s former assistant coach, has moved up to head coach and is being assisted by Tim O’Malley, a recent retiree from professional rugby with over 50 appearances for Tasman Mako. Elsewhere, St Thomas of Canterbury beat St Peter’s (Auckland) 36-21 after leading 21-7 at the break, while touring Rosmini College beat King’s High (Dunedin) 27-21. Marlborough Boys’ College completed a short tour of the capital with an unblemished record, accounting for St Bernard’s College 30-7, then at a grey and windswept NZCIS, Marlborough blunted Wellington Premiership champions St Patrick’s College Silverstream 17-7. Marlborough were semifinalists in the Miles Toyota Premiership last year, a result not achieved in the Crusaders region competition since 2014. This suggests a similar outcome may be attainable this season. Marlborough’s scrum is bolstered by burly and mobile props Jordyn Gardner and Mason Nicklin, whose brother Rico Nicklin is a tireless and combative captain. Both brothers scored tries in the win against Silverstream. Centre Anru Erasmus was described by one spectator as “Snakey” – surely a reference to Conrad Smith – and with more possession Vilikesa Nawaqa will raise alarm bells. Marlborough’s head coach is Tonga Taumoefolau, father of eye-catching Moana Pasifika winger Kyren Taumoefolau.

Title: Wall Street And The Dollar Tumble As Investors Retreat Further From The United States

NEW YORK (AP) — Wall Street weakened Monday as investors worldwide get more skeptical about U.S. investments because of President Donald Trump’s trade war and his criticism of the Federal Reserve, which are shaking the traditional order. The S&P 500 sank 2.4% in another wipeout. That yanked the index that’s at the center of many 401(k) accounts 16% below its record set two months ago. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 971 points, or 2.5%, while losses for Tesla and Nvidia helped drag the Nasdaq composite down 2.6%. Perhaps more worryingly, U.S. government bonds and the value of the U.S. dollar also sank as prices retreated across U.S. markets. It’s an unusual move because Treasurys and the dollar have historically strengthened during episodes of nervousness. This time around, though, it’s policies directly from Washington that are causing the fear and potentially weakening their reputations as some of the world’s safest investments. Trump continued his tough talk on global trade as economists and investors continue to say his stiff proposed tariffs could cause a recession if they’re not rolled back. U.S. talks last week with Japan failed to reach a quick deal that could lower tariffs and protect the economy, and they’re seen as a “test case,” according to Thierry Wizman, a strategist at Macquarie. “The golden rule of negotiating and success: He who has the gold makes the rules,” Trump said in all capitalized letters on his Truth Social Network. He also said that “the businessmen who criticize tariffs are bad at business, but really bad at politics,” likewise in all caps. Trump has recently focused more on China, the world’s second-largest economy, which has also been keeping up its rhetoric. China on Monday warned other countries against making trade deals with the United States “at the expense of China’s interest” as Japan, South Korea and others try to negotiate agreements. “If this happens, China will never accept it and will resolutely take countermeasures in a reciprocal manner,” China’s Commerce Ministry said in a statement. Also hanging over the market are worries about Trump’s anger at Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Trump last week criticized Powell again for not cutting interest rates sooner to give the economy more juice. The Fed has been resistant to lowering rates too quickly because it does not want to allow inflation to reaccelerate after slowing nearly all the way down to its 2% goal from more than 9% three years ago. Trump talked Monday about a slowdown for the U.S. economy that could be coming unless “Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.” A move by Trump to fire Powell would likely send a bolt of fear through financial markets. While Wall Street loves lower rates, largely because they boost stock prices, the bigger worry would be that a less independent Fed would be less effective at keeping inflation under control. Such a move could further weaken, if not kill, the United States’ reputation as the world’s safest place to keep cash. All the uncertainty striking pillars at the center of financial markets means some investors say they’re having to rethink the fundamentals of how to invest. “We can no longer extrapolate from past trends or rely on long-term assumptions to anchor portfolios,” strategists at BlackRock Investment Institute said in a report. “The distinction between tactical and strategic asset allocation is blurred. Instead, we need to constantly reassess the long-term trajectory and be dynamic with asset allocation as we learn more about the future state of the global system.” That in turn could push investors outside the United States to keep more of their money in their home markets, according to the strategists led by Jean Boivin. On Wall Street, Big Tech stocks helped lead indexes lower ahead of their latest earnings reports due later this week. Tesla sank 5.7%. The electric vehicle’s stock has more than halved from its record set in December on criticism that its stock price had gone too high and that its brand has become too entwined with Elon Musk, who’s leading the U.S. government’s efforts to cut spending. Nvidia fell 4.5% for a third straight drop after disclosing that U.S. export limits on chips to China could hurt its first-quarter results by $5.5 billion. They led another wipeout on Wall Street, and 92% of the stocks within the S&P 500 fell. Among the few gainers were Discover Financial Services and Capital One Financial, which climbed after the U.S. government approved their proposed merger. Discover rose 3.6%, while Capital One added 1.5%. All told, the S&P 500 fell 124.50 points to 5,158.20. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 971.82 to 38,170.41, and the Nasdaq composite tumbled 415.55 to 15,870.90. Gold also climbed to burnish its reputation as a safe-haven investment, unlike some others. In the bond market, shorter-term Treasury yields fell as investors expect the Fed to cut its main overnight interest rate later this year to support the economy. But longer-term yields rose with doubts about the United States’ standing in the global economy. The yield on the 10-year Treasury climbed to 4.40%, up from 4.34% at the end of last week and from just about 4% earlier this month. That’s a substantial move for the bond market.

Skip to comments. Posted on 04/21/2025 12:53:40 PM PDT by nickcarraway The deal aligns with companies across Hollywood stepping back from DEI policies. Parent company Paramount Global is seeking regulatory approval of its proposed merger with Skydance.CBS Studios has settled a lawsuit from a script coordinator for SEAL Team, who accused parent company Paramount of carrying illegal diversity quotas that discriminate against straight white men. Lawyers for both sides on Friday informed the court of a deal to settle the case. They noted that the “action and all claims and defenses asserted therein, be dismissed with prejudice,” meaning the lawsuit can’t be refiled, according to the filing. Terms of the agreement weren’t disclosed. The settlement aligns with companies across Hollywood rethinking diversity, equity and inclusion policies amid a larger retreat from initiatives under that label in the private sector driven by the government. That includes Disney, Warner Bros. Discovery and Paramount, which earlier this year eliminated staffing goals tied to race, ethnicity, sex and gender. The company also stopped collecting gender and diversity data for most U.S. job applicants and tying its employee incentive program to DEI goals, pointing to the U.S. Supreme Court striking down race-conscious admissions in universities and federal mandates that “require changes in the way our company approaches inclusion moving forward.” Related Stories Kathy Bates as Matty with Skye P. Marshall in the season finale. TV "Who the Hell Are You?": 'Matlock' Creator Answers Key Questions From Finale, Teasing Season 2 Padma Lakshmi TV Padma Lakshmi to Host Cooking Competition Series for CBS Some of those policies came under the spotlight last year when SEAL Team script coordinator Brian Beneker alleged in a lawsuit filed in California federal court that he was repeatedly denied a staff writer job after the implementation of an “illegal policy of race and sex balancing” that allegedly promoted the hiring of less qualified applicants from certain groups, namely those who identify as minorities, LGBTQ or women. He sought at least $500,000, as well as a court order making him a full-time producer on the series and barring the further use of discriminatory hiring practices. The court overseeing the case later rebuffed Paramount’s bid to dismiss the case. The lawsuit was settled as Paramount Global continues to seek regulatory approval of its proposed merger with Skydance. FCC commissioner Brendan Carr, who sent a letter to Comcast in February saying that he was investigating DEI policies, has asserted his authority over the sale due to the transfer of broadcast licenses. The agency continues to investigate CBS News’ handling of a 60 Minutes interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris. Beneker was represented by America First Legal Foundation, a conservative group founded by White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller. The firm, which was joined by JW Howard Attorneys, has brought federal complaints against major companies, including Starbucks, Morgan Stanley and BlackRock, arguing that corporate diversity and hiring practices run afoul of civil rights laws. It has targeted allegedly discriminatory hiring quotas at Disney, specifically a provision requiring that at least half of producer and writing staff come from underrepresented group that the company rolled back earlier this year. The settlement was reached as President Donald Trump’s administration continues to campaign against DEI programs in the media and entertainment sector. Carr in March urged the agency’s enforcement arm to open an investigation into Disney and ABC over whether the companies maintains discriminatory policies through racial quotas, among other things. Paramount and CBS declined to comment. Lawyers for Beneker didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.

Marshall in the season finale. TV "Who the Hell Are You?": 'Matlock' Creator Answers Key Questions From Finale, Teasing Season 2 Padma Lakshmi TV Padma Lakshmi to Host Cooking Competition Series for CBS Some of those policies came under the spotlight last year when SEAL Team script coordinator Brian Beneker alleged in a lawsuit filed in California federal court that he was repeatedly denied a staff writer job after the implementation of an “illegal policy of race and sex balancing” that allegedly promoted the hiring of less qualified applicants from certain groups, namely those who identify as minorities, LGBTQ or women. He sought at least $500,000, as well as a court order making him a full-time producer on the series and barring the further use of discriminatory hiring practices. The court overseeing the case later rebuffed Paramount’s bid to dismiss the case. The lawsuit was settled as Paramount Global continues to seek regulatory approval of its proposed merger with Skydance.

Beneker was represented by America First Legal Foundation, a conservative group founded by White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller.

Title: Pundit Explains Why He Believes Ripple’s XRP Price Has Already Been Determined
URL: https://zycrypto.com/pundit-explains-why-he-believes-ripples-xrp-price-has-already-been-determined/
Time Published: 2025-04-21T18:53:53Z
Full Content:
In a bold claim that has sparked debate in the crypto community, market pundit Versan Alajjarah asserts that XRP’s future price has already been predetermined by major financial institutions long before retail investors entered the market. Alajjarah’s argument comes even as XRP price continues to lag despite Ripple’s recent major wins like the XRP legal battle with the SEC and expanding ecosystem. In a recent article titled “XRP Price Already Set: What Global Institutions Know,” the pundit outlined a theory comparing XRP’s current situation to traditional pre-IPO processes. “The price of XRP has already been determined,” he stated, a position he’s maintained since 2022. According to his analysis, just as large institutional investors negotiate share prices before a company goes public, global financial entities like central banks, JP Morgan, BlackRock, and the IMF have already established XRP’s true value behind closed doors. “XRP is being adopted by the world’s largest financial players behind closed doors, and they have already agreed on a price for the technology’s use in their financial systems,” Alajjarah explained. He pointed to Ripple’s integration into financial systems of various central banks worldwide as evidence of this pre-arranged adoption. The Swan Capital founder further distinguishes between two XRP price realities. First, the institutional price, which is allegedly set through private negotiations for cross-border transactions and blockchain interoperability, and the retail price, which is currently subject to market speculation and manipulation. Notably, while he didn’t specify the exact set figure, he suggested the institutional price will “far exceed” current market values, potentially reaching “three to four-digit ranges” to facilitate multi-trillion-dollar financial transactions globally. “Central banks and large financial institutions aren’t going to transact in XRP at 50 cents. They need stability and confidence in the price when using XRP for large-scale settlements,” he noted, adding, “Retail price action is irrelevant to the larger institutional game already underway.” He believes XRP’s true value will only become apparent once its full role in the global financial system is realized. That said, the theory has generated mixed reactions within the crypto community. Blockchain enthusiast Jason Vonhunk rejected the prediction, stating, “It will never be triple digits. Ever. $100 = $10 trillion market cap. That’s Bitcoin’s entire global market cap, six times.” Others supported Alajjarah’s view, with one commenter noting, “Having done an IPO and capital raises on the stock market, this is the long-term reality, eventually.” Meanwhile, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has recently confirmed that a Ripple IPO is “possible, but not a priority.” However, although no official timeline has been set, speculation around a potential year-end IPO continues to grow. For XRP holders, a Ripple IPO could be a double-edged sword—bringing both opportunity and uncertainty. On the positive side, going public would likely generate significant buzz and credibility for Ripple, potentially accelerating adoption of its technology and XRP’s price.

Title: Strategy Increases Total Holdings To 538,200 BTC As Over 13,000 Institutions Are Exposed To The Bitcoin-Buying Firm
URL: https://zycrypto.com/strategy-increases-total-holdings-to-538200-btc-as-over-13000-institutions-are-exposed-to-the-bitcoin-buying-firm/

Strategy co-founder and Executive Chairman Michael Saylor has revealed that over 13,000 institutions now have direct exposure to the firm. The Bitcoin treasury company’s most recent acquisition of 6,556 BTC brought its total holdings to 538,200 BTC, valued at over $46 billion. Strategy’s stock (MSTR) is quickly becoming one of the key on-ramps into Bitcoin, not just for Wall Street but also for everyday investors, pension funds, and institutions worldwide. “Based on public data as of Q1 2025, over 13,000 institutions and 814,000 retail accounts hold MSTR directly. An estimated 55 million beneficiaries have indirect exposure through ETFs, mutual funds, pensions, and insurance portfolios,” Saylor wrote on X. Strategy’s increasing popularity among retail and institutional investors is noteworthy as the firm siphons capital from traditional financial markets and into Bitcoin. Increased capital flows translate into Strategy amassing more BTC, gradually boosting the price of the supply-capped crypto. Ironically, Wall Street giant Vanguard Group, known for its unwavering anti-Bitcoin stance, is still the top MSTR holder with over 16 million shares, despite reducing its stake by 6% in Q4 2024. Some other top institutions that hold Strategy stock include BlackRock, UBS Asset Management AG, State Street Global Advisors, Cantor Fitzgerald Asset Management, and Morgan Stanley. As reported by ZyCrypto, Strategy (formerly known as MicroStrategy) joined the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 index in December 2024 after witnessing tremendous gains during that year. The MSTR stock has gained 5.73% on a year-to-date basis. Interestingly, it has outperformed the Nasdaq-100, which is down 13%. Meanwhile, Strategy bought an additional 6,556 Bitcoin for $555.8 million between April 14 and April 20, according to a regulatory filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday. $MSTR has acquired 6,556 BTC for ~$555.8 million at ~$84,785 per bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 12.1% YTD 2025. As of 4/20/2025, @Strategy holds 538,200 $BTC acquired for ~$36.47 billion at ~$67,766 per bitcoin. https://t.co/YxUq6mHzca The purchase was funded through proceeds from the sale of its own shares to investors via ongoing stock sale programs. Between April 14 and April 20, Strategy sold 1.76 million shares of its Class A common stock (MSTR) and over 91,000 shares of a preferred stock series (STRK), raising a total of $555.5 million to fund the Bitcoin buy. The latest purchase pushes Strategy’s total stash to 538,200 BTC, purchased at an average price of $67,766 per coin. Overall, the Saylor-led company has spent $36.47 billion implementing its Bitcoin strategy. The price of Bitcoin is currently hovering at around $87,000. At that price, Strategy’s BTC cache is worth around $46.8 billion, marking a paper profit of approximately $10 billion. The company is committed to boosting its holdings after setting a goal of raising a whopping $42 billion by the end of 2027 to scoop up more BTC, regardless of market conditions.

Title: As Stocks Tumble Again, Donald Lashes Out At 'Major Loser' Jerome Powell

The U.S. dollar has fallen to a three-year low, and stocks are tumbling again today. Meanwhile, Donald weighed in to blame his tariff tantrums Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, while casting a conspiracy theory involving "Sleepy Joe Biden" and Kamala Harris. '“Preemptive Cuts” in Interest Rates are being called for by many," Lumpy wrote on Truth Social. "With Energy Costs way down, food prices (including Biden’s egg disaster!) substantially lower, and most other “things” trending down, there is virtually No Inflation." Fact check: Excluding food and energy, prices rose 2.8% in March. According to a study from SmartAsset, "While prices of fruits, vegetables and dairy products either increased or decreased depending on the location, eggs, meat and poultry soared almost unanimously, reaching over 9% or higher than just a year before — tripling the general rate of inflation." "With these costs trending so nicely downward, just what I predicted they would do, there can almost be no inflation, but there can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates," It added. "NOW. Europe has already “lowered” seven times. Powell has always been “To Late,” except when it came to the Election period when he lowered in order to help Sleepy Joe Biden, later Kamala, get elected. How did that work out?" To late, eh? The Stable Genius™ is referring to the European Central Bank (ECB) lowering interest rates for the seventh time since last June. However, the ECB took this action in response to concerns about trade tensions and their potential impact on the economic recovery. It's because of Donald's tariffs. Powell said last week that inflation is likely to go up as the cost of US tariffs makes its way to consumers. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink told CNBC that he believes the U.S. economy has weakened to the point where growth may turn negative. “I think we’re very close, if not in, a recession now,” Fink said. He's right. “The Street does not care anymore about words and ‘deal progress’ comments,” Wedbush analysts said on Sunday. “The economic damage done from this Trump back and forth tariff plan has likely pushed the economy towards a recession path already as cap ex [has been] halted across the board, hiring plans paused, price increase worries, and supply chain shock/chaos has sparked a level of uncertainty in the US not seen since Covid days.” We're going to have to hear his whining for over 3 1/2 years more. He will never stop. He's only been in office for a couple of months, and look what he's done to the global economy already.

Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter The deal aligns with companies across Hollywood stepping back from DEI policies. Parent company Paramount Global is seeking regulatory approval of its proposed merger with Skydance. By Winston Cho CBS Studios has settled a lawsuit from a script coordinator for SEAL Team, who accused parent company Paramount of carrying illegal diversity quotas that discriminate against straight white men. Lawyers for both sides on Friday informed the court of a deal to settle the case. They noted that the “action and all claims and defenses asserted therein, be dismissed with prejudice,” meaning the lawsuit can’t be refiled, according to the filing. Terms of the agreement weren’t disclosed. The settlement aligns with companies across Hollywood rethinking diversity, equity and inclusion policies amid a larger retreat from initiatives under that label in the private sector driven by the government. That includes Disney, Warner Bros. Discovery and Paramount, which earlier this year eliminated staffing goals tied to race, ethnicity, sex and gender. The company also stopped collecting gender and diversity data for most U.S. job applicants and tying its employee incentive program to DEI goals, pointing to the U.S. Supreme Court striking down race-conscious admissions in universities and federal mandates that “require changes in the way our company approaches inclusion moving forward.” Related Stories TV 'Einstein' Procedural, 'DMV' Comedy Land Series Orders at CBS TV 'Poppa's House' and 'The Summit' Canceled by CBS After Just One Season Some of those policies came under the spotlight last year when SEAL Team script coordinator Brian Beneker alleged in a lawsuit filed in California federal court that he was repeatedly denied a staff writer job after the implementation of an “illegal policy of race and sex balancing” that allegedly promoted the hiring of less qualified applicants from certain groups, namely those who identify as minorities, LGBTQ or women. He sought at least $500,000, as well as a court order making him a full-time producer on the series and barring the further use of discriminatory hiring practices. The court overseeing the case later rebuffed Paramount’s bid to dismiss the case. Paramount Global and CBS Studios have agreed to a settlement in a lawsuit America First Legal brought on behalf of our client Brian Beneker. America First Legal is pleased to see Paramount and CBS publicly back off their DEI requirements and return to merit-based considerations. Diversity quotas that discriminate on the basis of race are unlawful. Others in the entertainment industry should take note. The lawsuit was settled as Paramount Global continues to seek regulatory approval of its proposed merger with Skydance. FCC commissioner Brendan Carr, who sent a letter to Comcast in February saying that he was investigating DEI policies, has asserted his authority over the sale due to the transfer of broadcast licenses. The agency continues to investigate CBS News’ handling of a 60 Minutes interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris. Beneker was represented by America First Legal Foundation, a conservative group founded by White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller. The firm, which was joined by JW Howard Attorneys, has brought federal complaints against major companies, including Starbucks, Morgan Stanley and BlackRock, arguing that corporate diversity and hiring practices run afoul of civil rights laws. It has targeted allegedly discriminatory hiring quotas at Disney, specifically a provision requiring that at least half of producer and writing staff come from underrepresented group that the company rolled back earlier this year. In a statement, Nick Barry, a lawyer for Beneker, said, America First Legal is pleased to see Paramount and CBS publicly back off their DEI requirements and return to merit-based considerations.” He added, “Diversity quotas that discriminate on the basis of race are unlawful. Others in the entertainment industry should take note.” The settlement was reached as President Donald Trump’s administration continues to campaign against DEI programs in the media and entertainment sector. Carr in March urged the agency’s enforcement arm to open an investigation into Disney and ABC over whether the companies maintains discriminatory policies through racial quotas, among other things. Paramount and CBS declined to comment. Lawyers for Beneker didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.

Title: The Digital Asset Primer: On-Chain Tokenization for Payments Professionals
URL: https://www.pymnts.com/blockchain/2025/digital-asset-primer-on-chain-tokenization-payments-professionals/
Time Published: 2025-04-21T15:22:04Z

Highlights On-chain tokenization is shifting from concept to reality, enabling real-world assets like fiat, real estate and securities to be represented as programmable digital tokens on the blockchain. Tokenization offers new capital and liquidity strategies through real-time, cross-border and programmable money movement. Despite regulatory fragmentation and digital identity concerns, adoption is growing due to tokenization’s potential for speed, cost efficiency, transparency and automation. The convenience, security and speed of digital innovation have reshaped the way businesses and individuals transact. Now, money and assets are undergoing their own fundamental transformation. It’s all happening by way of tokenization on the blockchain. On-chain tokenization is moving from concept to practice, with players like Visa, Mastercard, J.P. Morgan and other commercial banks exploring or piloting real-world tokenized payment and financial systems. For chief financial officers and corporate treasurers, tokenization isn’t just a tech issue; it could represent a capital strategy shift. As recently as Friday (April 18), Vera Capital announced a partnership with Blocksquare to tokenize “a substantial portfolio of commercial and multifamily real estate assets” across the United States, having already tokenized a $5.4 million commercial property in Fort Lauderdale. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink also wants all assets to be tokenized on a blockchain and tradable online, writing in his shareholder letter: “Every stock, every bond, every fund — every asset — can be tokenized.” At its most fundamental level, tokenization refers to representing real-world assets, such as fiat currency, deposits, securities and investment contracts, as digital tokens on a distributed ledger. These tokens can then be transferred, programmed or settled in ways traditional systems don’t allow. Tokenization isn’t a cryptocurrency play. Tokenization helps give businesses and financial services stakeholders a way to move value faster, cheaper and more securely across different networks. It’s about modernizing the movement of money and assets while democratizing investment access to institutional-grade products. See also: Stablecoin Sandwiches? Here’s What CFOs Need to Know About Crypto Jargon Unlike traditional digital assets, which are typically ledger entries in a private system (like a bank or card network), on-chain tokens are blockchain-native. They can be programmed, split, audited or transferred with a few lines of code, and often faster than traditional methods allow. These tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) can be anything: fiat currency (like dollars or euros), real estate, equities, loyalty points or invoices. Payments giants aren’t waiting on regulators to get started prototyping. Last year, Visa tested the settlement of stablecoins. J.P. Morgan’s JPM Coin is now facilitating billions of dollars in daily transactions, primarily for institutional clients. “Banks are in the state where they are thinking about blockchains as public infrastructure that they need to rely on,” Chainalysis co-founder and CEO Jonathan Levin told PYMNTS this month. “When we started the business in 2014 … cryptocurrency only meant blockchains that had native cryptocurrency tokens,” he said. “Today, people are putting all types of financial instruments on the blockchain.” As appetite grows from corporate treasurers for 24/7 programmable money, tokenization could provide tangible benefits to companies managing global supply chains, complex vendor networks or digital platforms. While tokenized payments are not a panacea, they can help to solve specific, persistent pain points in the global movement of money. Read also: 3 Things Payment Stakeholders Can All Agree on About Stablecoins Cross-border payments, treasury management and programmable contracts are among the emerging real-world use cases for on-chain RWA. Traditional correspondent banking networks are fragmented and slow. Tokenized fiat or deposits on a shared ledger allow for near-instant cross-border transfers, potentially collapsing multiday settlement windows into minutes or seconds. This is among the main benefits of stablecoins, an increasingly popular payment mechanism that involves the tokenization of fiat and other reserve backings. At the same time, multinational corporations can struggle with liquidity fragmentation across jurisdictions. Tokenized deposits can be moved 24/7 across entities or regions, enabling just-in-time funding and optimizing working capital. Blockchain-based smart contracts can also allow conditional or milestone-based payments to execute automatically, which could prove useful for trade finance, supply chains or royalty payments. Ultimately, tokenization’s benefits such as real-time liquidity, conditional payments and borderless value exchange can create competitive advantages. Two primary roadblocks to scalable utility across the enterprise are regulatory fragmentation and digital identity. Regulatory alignment remains patchy, especially across borders. Cybersecurity and smart contract auditing are still evolving. And adoption depends not just on technology, but on user trust and industry coordination. Sensitive financial data and transactions may be increasingly exposed to public scrutiny on-chain, so there’s a pressing need to address privacy and identity challenges within crypto. However, the marketplace isn’t standing still, and work is being done to overcome these challenges. For forward-thinking finance leaders, it could be worth entertaining that the next decade of payments may be built not just with APIs and rails, but with tokens, smart contracts and interoperable ledgers.

Pedigree counts. Clontarf and Cork Constitution set up a heavyweight Energia All-Ireland League final next Sunday in the second leg of an Aviva Stadium double with the women’s final after taut, tight, hard-earned semi-final wins over Lansdowne and St Mary’s respectively. Clontarf, the 2022 champions, will thus meet the reigning champions Con in a Leinster-Munster affair. It was always unlikely that the Clontarf-Lansdowne semi-final would scale the heights of the former’s astonishing 49-46 win between the sides at Castle Avenue, which had been played on the club’s all-weather pitch. Aside from the heightened stakes, the heavy rain of the previous 24 hours or so had left the pitch gluey. That said, it was a lively start. The Lansdowne backs had the better individual flair and strike plays, as evidenced by the move from deep which eventually led to outhalf Stephen Madigan cross-kicking perfectly for lock Ruairí Clarke to score. Clontarf began to find more traction and Ben Griffin burst through the Lansdowne defence from Conor Kelly’s pass for scrumhalf Sam Owens to finish. Kelly converted, but his pass was then picked off by Charlie Tector who scored from halfway and added the conversion. But Kelly and ‘Tarf are tough competitors, and after he exchanged penalties with Tector, Clontarf opted for the corner with the last play of the first half for a trademark power play and a try by Griffin which Kelly converted for a 15-13 interval lead. Though scoreless, the second period ebbed consistently. The margins remained tiny and the noise levels ratcheted up before Aaron Coleman won the game’s final penalty to huge home celebrations. Con will be seeking to become the first club to win back-to-back AIL titles since Shannon in 2006 after a 16-8 arm wrestle over newly promoted St Mary’s on an even heavier pitch at Templeville Road. The home side went ahead through a blindside try off a maul by flanker Ethan Baxter but Con availed of successive yellow cards for the influential St Mary’s duo of captain Ronan Waters and fullback Conor Hayes either side of the interval. First James Taylor landed a penalty and then scrumhalf Adam Maher set up captain David Hyland for a try, which Taylor converted. Taylor extended the lead before Hayes trimmed it again. But after Mary’s went to the corner with one penalty to be repelled, Hayes then missed another before Taylor sealed the deal. The promotion/relegation semi-finals featured four wins by just one or two points. Nenagh have moved to within one match of becoming the first Tipperary club in the top flight after a 25-17 win over Blackrock to set up a promotion decider next Saturday at New Ormond Park against UCC, for whom first-half tries by centres by Daniel Squires and Irish Under-20 midfielder Gene O’Leary Kareem helped earn the day’s only other away win to relegate City of Armagh. Trinity earned themselves a Division 1B lifeline with a nerve-jangling 20-18 win over Greystones to earn a promotion/relegation decider against Cashel, relatively comfortable 26-14 winners over Barnhall. Similarly, Navan will seek to avoid relegation in their centenary year after their 29-19 win over Galwegians earned a decider at home to Dungannon, for whom Ben McCaughey’s penalty with the last kick earned a 23-22 win over local rivals Clogher Valley. In the 2B promotion playoff, Skerries’ 27-18 semi-final win over Ballyclare has earned them a decider against Midleton, who beat Dolphin 18-17 in their all-Cork semi-final. Division 1A semi-finals: St Mary’s Col 8 Cork Con 16; Clontarf 17 Lansdowne 15. Division 1A promotion playoff semi-finals: City of Armagh 10 UCC 17; Nenagh Ormond 25 Blackrock College 17. Division 1B promotion playoff semi-finals: Cashel RFC 26 MU Barnhall 14; Dublin University 20 Greystones 18. Division 2A promotion playoff semi-finals: Dungannon 23 Clogher Valley 22; Navan 29 Galwegians 19. Division 2B promotion playoff semi-finals: Midleton 18 Dolphin 17; Skerries 27 Ballyclare 10.

Tom Gilsenan Terry Healy JF Sir — It was great to see last week’s Sunday Independent acknowledging some of the people who for years have been regular writers to your Letters page (‘Dear Sir’, People & Culture). These familiar names, the correspondents who have provided us with lots of entertainment, debate and sometimes controversy on a wide range of topics. This is what makes your Letters page such unmissable reading, and for me often the most interesting page. It was so nice to hear your letter writers’ motivation and interests and put a face to these talented people. I have to commend the way your paper never flinches from publishing letters from readers criticising articles in previous editions. Brian Lube, Co Meath Sir — I thoroughly enjoyed the letter writers article. It was wonderful to finally put faces to the names of those prolific writers. The fourth wall has been broken and has revealed an ageing demographic, one whose connection to the written word is more deeply ingrained then those who might come after them. Such a striking revelation is not to be taken lightly — it is a reflection of the times, and the printed page is showing its age. We live in a TikTok generation where the past is consumed in the present and the present is living only because it brings forth the future. Although this future is uncertain, my hope is that the art of letter writing will endure, and tangible, well-crafted thoughts and opinions will prevail — that these words, written by anyone, will continue to be addressed to everyone. Elliot McCarthy, The Tower, Cork Sir — Your piece profiling 10 regular contributors to the Letters page was illuminating. It’s nice to put faces to so many familiar names, including a few that I’ve had the pleasure of sparring with over the years. However, readers of the article would be forgiven for thinking letter writing is the preserve of those enjoying or approaching retirement. On the contrary, some of us are 30 and younger, have 15 years’ worth of published letters under our belts and entertain hopes there are many more to come. Letter writing as a pastime and a therapy has multi-generational appeal. Killian Foley-Walsh, Kilkenny city Sir — Ah, stop the lights. I’ve just opened my Sunday Indo and there he is in the flesh, none other than the mysterious Tom Gilsenan. The number of times I have asked myself, “Who the hell is this Tom Gilsenan constantly getting published?”, before eventually concluding he was actually a journalist in disguise — possibly far more talented and interesting, I might add. Keep them coming, Tom, now I know you are not some kind of bot masquerading as a human. Seriously, you generally hit the nail on the head. Well done you, and fair play to Roslyn Dee, whom I adore as a columnist. Breeda Geraghty, Shrule, Co Mayo Sir — Roslyn Dee’s piece was fascinating. In the St Petersburg Times in 1951, PG Wodehouse wrote: “I yearn to write letters to the papers. All authors do. Novelists are merely those who have failed as contributors to the Correspondence Column. Unable to make the grade, they drop down a rung on the ladder and write novels.” Brendan Kelly, professor of psychiatry, Trinity College Dublin Sir — I’m not entirely sure how I feel about seeing the faces of fellow letter writers to national newspapers. A bit like Bansky, the pseudo­nymous street artist, not really knowing who is behind the art is part of the fascination of seeing letters appear in print — at least for me. Nevertheless, I have to take my hat off to the witticisms of Tom Gilsenan, who clearly is a fan of Beckett — less is more. And to Mary Stewart from Donegal, whose political views would differ from mine. She once had a go at me in print for criticising something David Quinn wrote — called me a “Lumiere”. As a lover of the big screen, I viewed that as a compliment of the highest order. Thank you, Mary! Finally, to the editor, who put Tournageehy firmly on the map. My father would be proud. Tom McElligott, Tournageehy, Listowel, Co Kerry Sir — I was delighted to see letter writers being recognised and written about. I was once referred to as “your prolific letter writer”. My prolific days ended, as happenings in life began to take a toll, but I am now hopeful of attempting to continue the joy of writing letters to the editor, starting with this particular one, be it published or not. Brian McDevitt, Glenties, Co Donegal Sir — Thanks a million for featuring the brilliant letter writers. It was great to see the faces with the names. While I loved the piece by Roslyn Dee about me, I did not recognise myself in the photo. So I’m sending you one of myself taken four weeks ago. Perhaps you could print it with this letter? (See above). Terry Healy Riordan, Kill, Co Kildare Sir — Sarah Caden’s very ­welcome interview with Helen Joyce (People & Culture, April 13) could not have been more timely, coming as it did on the same day we learnt a legal action seeking a judicial review of the State’s treatment of children with gender identity issues is due to come before the High Court. Helen Joyce had a significant career in maths and journalism, but took up the task of challenging gender identity ideology and its ramifications. She is one of the most prominent figures called on to speak in defence of the rights of women and the need to safeguard the interests of children from being misled by activists and others in authority. There is no room for compla­cency here either, and the ­Government needs to educate ­itself about the risks of promoting this ideology. The fallout from this is ­already being seen in other countries, with a growing number of adults now realising they have been harmed irreversibly through the use of hormones and possibly surgery when they were younger. Further risk to Irish children might be avoided if those in positions of authority in the HSE, teaching and ­politics heed the warnings by Helen Joyce and others of the dangers posed by this ideology, which has led to this medical scandal. Thank you for bringing attention to the work of this tremendous woman, one whom we can be proud to call our own. Jill Nesbitt, Bray, Co Wicklow Sir — The interview with ­Helen Joyce was engaging, but for me what was surprising was your statement that “no Irish media outlet had interviewed the bestselling [Irish] author”. Why not? The UK Supreme Court has just ruled that a woman is someone born at birth as biologically ­female. It has been described as a “commonsense decision”. Yet the Irish political class cannot tell us what a woman is. Their verbal somersaults are at best amusing, especially in light of the Cass Report. It is almost a year since Jacky Grainger (Sunday Independent interview, May 4, 2024) beseeched the political class to find the “courage and integrity” to slay the gender ideology gripping the state and put children’s health and lives at the forefront of policy. Sadly, the gender ideological tectonic plates have not yet moved. Andy Hales, Kenmare, Co Kerry Sir — The interview with ­Helen Joyce was a delight: Joyce has been effectively cancelled by the Irish media for so long because of her rational and sensible views on the trans issue. Hopefully, now you have broken the spell, we may see and hear more from Joyce and others who support women’s rights. Similarly, RTÉ might now have the courage to interview other gender-critical writers and activists, rather than the one-­sided propaganda that has been pushed unopposed for so long. Julia Anderson, Greystones, Co Wicklow Sir — I was delighted that you finally interviewed Helen Joyce. She eloquently expresses views of the majority of people — that humans can’t change sex; that women and girls deserve single sex spaces, services and sports; that gender non-conforming children are not born in the wrong body and don’t need to be medically and surgically ‘fixed’; and that forcing lesbians to accept men who identify as women into their dating pool is modern-day gay conversion therapy. Unless our politicians and organisations recognise this, we are facing further dismantling of women’s and gay rights and of child safeguarding. Elena Brooks, Glenageary, Co Dublin Sir — Helen Joyce is a mathematician. As such, she reduces and separates humanity to a ­binary — men and women. She is no authority on trans people, nor on gender issues, as evidenced by the ruling of an Australian judge who said in a recent case that “she is not an expert at all. She has no recognised expertise in any of the areas in which she expresses an opinion”. Joyce tells us she knows trans people, but she has books to sell, so she has commoditised trans people’s lives. As mammies, we know that people, including trans people, cannot be reduced to numerical equations, to one or zero. Humanity is not binary. We, the mammies, know a lot of trans people, some since the day they were born. We hold their hands when they are scared, happy, ­upset, joyful. We have heard their hopes, their dreams, and dried their tears. We listen to trans people. Helen Joyce does not. We have no books to sell; just love to give. Love always wins. Jude Copeland, Bernie ­Linnane, Claire Flynn, Karen Sugrue, Mammies for Trans Rights Sir — I want to sincerely thank you for publishing your powerful and honest interview with Helen Joyce. She’s one of the few people brave enough to speak clearly and compassionately about a subject most are too afraid to touch. It is no accident that RTÉ and other media outlets refuse to interview her. They know if ­Helen is given the chance to speak plainly, their ideology cannot withstand it. They cannot ­explain why they are endorsing the sterilisation of vulnerable children in the name of identity — so instead, they silence people like Helen and smear them as unkind or extreme. But we see through it. I know I’m not alone. I’ve had countless hushed conversations with friends, neighbours and colleagues who agree with everything Helen says, but who are terrified to say so out loud. We need to be braver. The truth cannot survive if we whisper it behind closed doors. Sarah Holmes, Newcastle, Co Wicklow Sir — Your interview with ­Helen Joyce was a courageous piece that gave voice to opinions that are forbidden in most quarters of the Irish media. Dr Joyce’s remark that it is “wicked” to lie to parents by telling them their children are at increased risk of suicide if they are not “affirmed” in the belief that they were born in the wrong body deserves serious reflection. Every journalist, politician, doctor, teacher and psychotherapist must reckon with the long-term consequences of repeating claims not supported by evidence, especially when they result in irreversible damage. Truth and compassion are not mutually exclusive. Thank you for publishing an article that ­attempts to honour both. Sandra Adams, Baldoyle, Dublin 13 Sir — I read with interest the long-overdue interview with Helen Joyce. I hope this signals the end of the apparent media blackout of Irish groups like The Countess, whose founder and CEO Laoise de Brún has been campaigning on these issues since 2020. It would be refreshing to see more journalists being curious enough to cover all sides in this conversation and not continue to keep their heads in the sand. Sorcha Nic Lochlainn, director and sport ­spokeswoman, The Countess Sir — Like so many of us in ­Ireland, Helen Joyce found out that to even ask questions about gender identity can result in ­being called a bigot. The ­shaming and silencing of people asking sometimes difficult questions is ultimately harming the most vulnerable when it comes to this topic — the young people with gender dysphoria. Thank you for publishing this very important interview. Colette Colfer, Waterford city Sir — I congratulate you on publishing Sarah Caden’s careful interview with Helen Joyce. I will hold off asking “What took you so long?” as it is a question that could be asked broadly of Irish media. The cover of Joyce’s book reads Trans: When Ideology Meets Reality. Let us support children and young people to live in that reality, and look forward to the Irish media reporting on the reality of the evidence and not ideological opinion. Name with editor, Dublin 6 Sir — What a wonderful surprise to see Helen Joyce finally interviewed in a mainstream Irish newspaper. Well past time, of course. Liz Fitzpatrick, Rathfarnham, Dublin 14 Sir — Following the UK Supreme Court judgment, will we finally see the same ruling apply in ­Ireland, or will minority groups use legislation already in place to demand the same rights as those of biological women? We shall wait and see. Christy Galligan, Letterkenny, Co Donegal Sir — It was great to see Northern Ireland as the subject of an editorial in the ­Sunday Independent (April 13). The question of the future of this island is very important and, in fairness to the Sunday ­Independent, it does treat the ­issue consistently. The editorial raised important issues such as whether talk of unity is a “distraction” and what might be the best way forward. It also raised the important but complex issue of reconciliation. I would be of the opinion that talk of unity can never be a distraction and that we must always be looking for a better way forward for everyone on the island. I accept there will be different views and I welcome strong debate and forthright opinion. Everyone should be challenged. I mostly find, in fact, that other people’s ideas are better than my own. However, the editorial and a column by Máiría Cahill made Leo Varadkar look like an Irish equivalent of Alexei Navalny, someone to be belittled and ­silenced. It is regrettable when an attempt is made to silence other views and to denigrate the person expressing them. None of this is to take away from the fact the Sunday Independent is to be congratulated for consistently keeping the North on the agenda. However, it should play the ball, not the man. Jim D’Arcy, Blackrock, Dundalk, Co Louth Sir — Our older citizens suffer mostly in silence with the enemy of old age — arthritis. Do our major milk companies know how hard it is to open a plastic two-litre bottle of milk now? God forbid we might throw out the containers without the now permanently attached tops. Pouring milk into a cup of tea is hard enough without having to deal with some bright spark’s invention on behalf of the nanny state. Mike Burke, Sixmilebridge, Co Clare Sir — Aspects of Sinn Féin’s past will never endear me or many of my generation to the party. Nevertheless, one has to respect its determination and appreciate its sustained role in opposition. Across the Atlantic, one of the most disturbing aspects of Donald Trump’s behaviour is the almost complete absence of any opposition to his assault on ­democracy. Whereas Republic­ans would have you believe most of the world is arriving in swooning, ass-kissing waves to the White House, the ­Democrats would be well advised to dispatch a no-nonsense, resuscitation delegation to meet Mary Lou McDonald. Michael Gannon, St Thomas Square, Kilkenny Sir — I read with interest Pat O’Callaghan’s letter in the Sunday Independent of April 13. He wishes to return workers to pre-1990 annual leave entitlement. Might I recommend he read a book by John Timpson, Upside Down Management. This is a ­bible on staff relations. As someone who was a dedic­ated trade union activist for over 45 years, I could not sit in ­silence at this suggestion to erode a hard-earned entitlement. It is as outrageous as ­Finance Minister Jack Chambers announcing the increase in the minimum wage will be delayed. A minister is paid 7.6 times the minimum wage, not to mention the litany of ­allowances. I have always honoured the Starry Plough and always will. Paddy Murray, Castlepollard, Co Westmeath Sir — I read Brighid McLaughlin’s evocative account of modern Belfast (April 13) with keen interest. It brought back sharp memories of my own student days in the city during the 1970s, when it was a very ­different place indeed. Back then, you constantly had to assess your surroundings. My wife often encourages me to go up from Armagh for a day in Belfast, but I usually prefer ­Dublin. There’s still a shadow over the city in my mind, a residue of the fear we lived with. I remember dating a girl from Moy — part of what was then grimlyknown as the Murder ­Triangle — and walking her home at night, petrified by the risks. Not long ago, I met an old friend home from Calgary. We were sitting in a pub in Moy with his daughter, who grew up in Canada. I found myself saying things I hadn’t voiced in years — how, during the Troubles, we would never have sat near a pub window for fear of a car bomb or a random shooting. It shocked her, as it shocks me now. And yet I have nothing but admiration for the people of ­Belfast. Take politics out of it, and they’ll help you with anything. That same wit, warmth and fierce decency McLaughlin captured still shines through. Enda Cullen, Tullysaran Road, Co Armagh Sir — I am writing in response to Eilis O’Hanlon’s article (‘If you want us to watch Irish TV shows, make them better’, April 13), which takes issue with the idea of imposing levies on international streaming services to fund local productions. Is it from ignorance or wilful misinformation that Eilis chooses Dancing with the Stars and Home of the Year as the kind of programming that would be supported by this levy? Nothing could be farther from the truth. RTÉ is no friend of quality production, and the Irish film and TV industry has known this for years. The breakdown has already been worked out, with 75pc going to independent productions and a substantial portion to the Irish language. So it is more projects like Kneecap, Small Things Like These, An Cailín Ciúin, The Young Offenders and Bad Sisters that will be made. I hesitate to mention Bodkin. It is polarising, but it is at least something. Countries that have implemented such levies have witnessed significant growth in their local industries. France, for instance, requires that streaming services invest a portion of their revenues in French productions. Between 2021 and 2023, this policy led to an injec­tion of nearly €1bn into the French film and TV sector, resulting in 81 films. Netflix’s investment in Beating Hearts became Studio­Canal’s highest-grossing French release. And Netflix subscription costs in France range from €5 to €3 cheaper than in Ireland, so no additional cost to the consumer. In contrast, the UK, which has yet to adopt such levies, faces challenges in sustaining its domestic productions. The BBC anticipates airing 50 fewer hours of drama this year due to budget constraints, and Channel 4 has halved its commissioning. Unless you require global platforms to contribute fairly to the ecosystems they profit from, they simply won’t. Nothing to do with quality — it’s economics. They will only spend it in the countries that do force them to do it, to the detriment of ours. And let’s face it, the minister’s reluctance to follow through on the levies that have already been agreed has more to do with an avoidance of anything that could look like a “tariff” in the current climate. And that’s a whole other matter. Tom Hopkins, Clare Street, Dublin Sir — I believe, given my own negative health experiences, that multi-storey car parks present a serious health hazard. I have noticed that by the time I get to the shopping centre attached to the car park, I am feeling unwell and slightly dizzy. I feel nauseous nausea and have unusual heartbeats. Why is this? I believe it is caused by the carbon monoxide from the hundreds of vehicles in the car park. It is particularly bad on a dead day with little or no wind. However, even with wind, if you get enough cars you can still have a highly poisonous soup. The Government, and anyone interested in their own health, or public health, should take notice. Maurice Fitzgerald, Shanbally, Co Cork Sir — David Quinn rightly identifies the ludicrous demand made by the Mother and Baby Institutions Payment Scheme on the Legion of Mary to contribute over €26m to redress (Opinion, April 13). Within the first decade of its foundation, Frank Duff’s lay Catholic organisation had built the Morning Star Hostel for homeless men along with the Regina Coeli Hostel for women. The latter began to accept pregnant women and unmarried mothers in contravention of the mores of the time. Duff’s new departure to keep mothers and babies drew additional financial pressures on the Legion of Mary. Finola Kennedy in her book Frank Duff: A Life Story outlines that Duff’s vision in keeping mothers and their babies together was dependent on donations from supporters such as WT Cosgrave, Seán MacBride McBrideand Archbishop John Charles McQuaid. The architects of the redress scheme in relation to the Legion of Mary should return to the drawing board. Frank Burke, Terenure, Dublin D6W Sir — It’s ironic that the Farrelly Commission cost €13.6m and discovered nary an abuse. The saying “See no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil” while costing the taxpayers an extortionate amount comes to mind. Aileen Hooper, Stoneybatter, Dublin 7 Sir— Donald Trump telling us people have been queuing up to kiss his ass is, for me at least, proof positive that there is a donkey in the White House.

Title: 'My Mom Brings Up Every Excuse In The Book,' Says One Millennial Who Sends Her Money. Asks, 'Anyone Else Doing This Every Month?'

Time Published: 2025-04-20T00:31:31Z
Full Content:
A post on the r/Millennials subreddit has struck a nerve with thousands of users after one woman asked, "Anyone else give your parent(s) money every month?" In the post, the original poster, who said she's a public sector lawyer in her 30s, explained that she's been sending her mother around $4,000 a year for nearly a decade. She also gave her mom a car, chipped in on another one, and gives extra cash on birthdays and holidays. Don't Miss: "I'm not a rich woman either," she wrote, adding that she paid her way through law school with student loans and paid off the debt herself. "But what really irks me," she continued, "is when I mention investments, she tells me, ‘Older people never really invested – we didn't have the same opportunities.'" That's where the conversation blew up. Many Reddit users pushed back on the mom's claim that older generations didn't have access to investing. One 67-year-old commenter wrote: "We had hella great investing opportunities in our generation. Microsoft? Amazon? Apple? Starbucks? Real Estate? Yeah." Another added, "People get mad when I point out millennials have more savings than boomers at their age, but it is actually the truth backed up by many studies. Fact is, millennials know they cannot rely on boomers for support so they save. Boomers expect everyone else to support them so they don’t." Several noted that while OP's father, who's older than her mom, invested regularly and planned ahead, her mother took out a second mortgage and racked up credit card debt instead. Trending: BlackRock is calling 2025 the year of alternative assets. One firm from NYC has quietly built a group of 60,000+ investors who have all joined in on an alt asset class previously exclusive to billionaires like Bezos and Gates. Turns out, plenty of Redditors could relate. Some said they send their parents money monthly, even when it's a financial strain. Others described living with parents or covering expenses like rent, car payments, groceries and phone bills. A few mentioned they expect to support their parents for the rest of their lives, not out of wealth, but out of love and guilt. "[My mom] never held down a job, never saved anything, never invested anything, and she sells anything of value she happens to have the moment she blows through her cigarette money," one commenter wrote. "Now she lives with me because her landlord sold the property, and of course, she and her boyfriend just waited until it happened. " Others admitted they've cut off family members entirely. See Also: Hasbro, MGM, and Skechers trust this AI marketing firm — invest pre-IPO from $0.60 per share now. Some commenters, especially those from immigrant or Latino families, pointed to cultural expectations. "I'm Latina, and our parents’ generation truly enjoys receiving money from their kids because ‘we are their retirement,’" one user said. "That messed-up way of thinking ends with me, I refuse to think of my only child as my 401(k)." Another user in the Philippines shared that he pays for house help for his parents while his siblings cover the utility bills, even though there's no formal agreement, just an obligation. But others pushed for boundaries. "If you're giving $400 a month and don't know where it's going, that's a problem," one person said. "You're not helping. You're enabling." OP clarified in the thread that her mom did help with childcare early on, but that was years ago. Since then, she's been paying full-time daycare plus her mom's stipend. "It irritates me that she brings up every excuse in the book as to why her finances are bad," she wrote. Still, there were some who said they're happy to help their parents — if only because they know no one else will. Read Next: Image: Shutterstock © 2025 Benzinga.com.

Title: How To Find Massive Dividend Deals In The Tariff Panic
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelfoster/2025/04/19/how-to-find-massive-dividend-deals-in-the-tariff-panic/

ByMichael Foster ByMichael Foster, Contributor. Red Tariffs newspaper headlines with assorted economy related topics On one front, this tariff pandemonium changes nothing for us: We still see our favorite high-yield investments—8%-plus paying closed-end funds—as the best choice to anchor your retirement portfolio. In fact, times like this add to their appeal even more. That’s because, in a crash, we CEF investors don’t have to sell a single unit of our funds to get the cash we need to fund our lives. Our big dividends—many of which roll in monthly—take care of our needs for us. Then there’s CEFs’ discounts to net asset value (NAV, or the value of their underlying portfolios). This unique-to-CEF measure tells us when a fund is cheap or pricey. And right now, thanks to the tariff panic, we’ve got a raft of discounted CEFs to choose from. And there’s one more edge we can exploit with CEFs: the fact that CEF investors are very conservative and lean heavily toward funds with long track records. This tendency to go with the tried-and-true opens up an opportunity for us. That’s because many CEF firms, like Nuveen, PIMCO and BlackRock, have CEFs of all ages in their stables. Here’s the thing, though: Whether the fund is “young” or “old,” they all tend to be run by the exact same people. So we can, in effect, buy a younger CEF and take advantage of its discount. Then we simply ride along as it ages, and its valuation nears that of its older sibling. Let’s zero in on this opportunity by looking at three CEFs from PIMCO, a California-based firm that’s long had a grip on CEF investors’ imaginations: the PIMCO Corporate & Income Opportunity Fund (PTY), PIMCO Access Income Fund (PAXS) and PIMCO Dynamic Income Strategy Fund (PDX). PIMCO’s “brand halo” makes it difficult to buy its funds at a discount. Let’s start with PTY, far and away the oldest of our trio. Launched over 20 years ago, PTY sports an 11.2% yield that investors, well, love. It’s also by far the biggest of the three, with $2.3 billion in assets under management, compared to $910 million for PDX and $665 million for PAXS. On the other side, you have PAXS, with a 12.3% yield, and PDX, which yields 7.9%. PAXS launched at the start of 2022, and PDX is a bit older, having held its IPO in 2019. But even that 2019 date is young by CEF standards; it makes PDX the second-youngest PIMCO CEF on the market. But PTY overshadows its two younger siblings because its age lets investors analyze its long-haul payout history. And that history is very favorable indeed: PTY Dividend Here you can see that PTY’s payouts have been pretty steady over 20 years, which included the pandemic, the subprime-mortgage crisis, and the low interest rates of the 2010s. (The spikes and dips in the purple line above are special dividends.) While it’s true that the regular payouts have dipped a bit (cut 13.6% since the fund’s IPO), the average annualized yield on PTY has been 11.3% for investors who bought at the IPO date, as of this writing. To put that in perspective, someone who bought $100,000 worth of PTY has earned, on average, an income stream of $945 per month (a bit over $11,300 per year) without having to do a single thing. So, you can see why PTY has attracted a premium to NAV throughout its history. This simply means investors are willing to pay more for PTY than its portfolio is worth. It makes sense when you think about it: PTY gives investors a steady paycheck, which encourages them to stick with the fund. As a result, there are fewer shares of PTY on the market, since CEFs—unlike ETFs—tend to have a fixed share count over their lifespans. This means PTY’s market price tends to drift upward more than its NAV does. Although that’s been going up too: PTY Total Returns In total, PTY has earned an 11.7% annualized return on a NAV basis, as of this writing. That’s higher than the 11.3% average yield investors have received, so you can see how PTY has been able to maintain payouts for over two decades. To be clear, for every dollar put in PTY, over $10 in profit has been generated. When you consider that, the fund’s premium to NAV makes even more sense. And it follows that this premium would survive the tariff mayhem: PTY’s record is just too good. Now let’s shift back to the younger PAXS and PDX. They don’t have the track records to attract investors like PTY does, even though they’re managed by the same people. That’s why we have seen PAXS’s premium all but disappear amid the tariff panic, while PDX’s discount has grown wider. PIMCO Discounts This is a clear buy signal, but let me back that call up with another chart showing these funds’ dividend histories. PDX/PAXS Dividend History Now before we go further, yes, PDX’s dividend line (in orange) looks a bit wonky. There are two reasons for that: One, the fund launched just before the pandemic and, at the end of 2020, it cut its distribution by more than half. Two, PDX moved from quarterly payouts to monthly dividends in March 2024, so the dividend went from 26 cents, when the fund paid its last quarterly dividend in March 2024, to 11.3 cents a month. That masked a big raise that looks like a dip in the orange line above. PDX Dividend History In reality, PDX increased its payouts by more than 30% in early 2024. PAXS meantime, has seen one hike to its regular dividend since launch, along with a big special payout in late 2022. That “bonus” payout came as the markets were at their most fearful; thanks to PAXS’s focus on debt, it can ensure strong payouts, even when stock markets are panicking. You’d think strong income plays like these would attract buyers, despite their young ages. And they no doubt will—but not now, with the tariffs causing terror among the most conservative investors. That fear has dragged down both funds’ valuations, making both strong buys. Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook.

Bitcoin and crypto prices, after swinging wildly along with stocks, are braced for an epic showdown between U.S. president Donald Trump and Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell. Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes’ CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" The bitcoin price has held up better than the tech-heavy Nasdaq as tariff turmoil rocks crypto and equity markets, with billionaire Ray Dalio warning of “monetary order breakdown” that could spell something worse than 2008. Now, as Treasury secretary Scott Bessent issues a surprising bitcoin price prediction, the chief executive of the world’s largest crypto exchange has said Binance is advising countries on following the U.S. in adopting bitcoin as a strategy reserve asset. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run U.S. president Donald Trump has kick started a race for countries around the world to begin adopting ... More bitcoin—something that could blow up the bitcoin price. "We have actually received quite a number of approaches by a few governments and sovereign wealth funds on the establishment of their own crypto reserves," Richard Teng, who took over the top job at Binance after founder Changpeng "CZ" Zhao was ousted when he and the company plead guilty to failing to prevent money laundering in 2023, told the Financial Times without naming the countries. Binance has also "been approached by quite a lot" of countries to "[help] them with formulating their regulatory framework to govern crypto," Teng added. Trump has made passing long-awaited crypto legislation a priority for his second administration, as well as signing an executive order that calls for the creation of a bitcoin strategic reserve and crypto stockpile. “Compared to many other jurisdictions, [the U.S. is] way ahead on that front,” Teng said, adding it’s spurred countries into action. In March, Standard Chartered Bank’s head of crypto research Geoff Kendrick predicted the bitcoin price could surge to $500,000 per bitcoin within three years due to the creation of a U.S. bitcoin and crypto reserve. Earlier this month, Pakistan and Kyrgyzstan revealed CZ, who still holds a majority stake in Binance, had begun advising them on developing crypto regulations and adoption of bitcoin and crypto. “It makes sense that countries would reach out to industry players to ensure they have informed views on policy,” Anthony Pompliano, the chief executive of Professional Capital Management, said in an emailed note. “This is the game theory that bitcoiners have been talking about for decades. Once one large nation starts to acquire bitcoin, all countries are incentivized to compete to acquire bitcoin … it is not possible to ignore the United States of America—the greatest economy ever constructed in human history. If America says bitcoin is strategically important, then other countries will start seeing the asset that way as well." This month, Bo Hines, executive director of the presidential council of advisers for digital assets, said the U.S. is exploring many ways to increase its bitcoin reserve without using additional taxpayer dollars, including through tariff revenue and revaluing the government’s gold certificates. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has dropped back from its all-time high of almost $110,000 per bitcoin but remains ... More far higher than where it was before the November U.S. election. “We’re looking at many creative ways, whether it be from tariffs, there’s literally countless ways in which you can do this,” Hines said in an interview with Pompliano. “Bitcoin is experiencing unprecedented recognition at the highest levels of government, but it’s not happening in a silo," David Bailey, the chief executive of Bitcoin Magazine publisher BTC Inc, which also organizes the bitcoin conference at which Trump first proposed the creation of a U.S. bitcoin strategic reserve, said in a statement teasing the upcoming Las Vegas Bitcoin 2025 conference. "President Trump’s establishment of a strategic bitcoin reserve is one of many steps he’s taken to promote American innovation," Bailey said. In January, BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink revealed he’s had discussions with sovereign wealth funds about buying bitcoin and predicted such conversations could catapult the bitcoin price to $700,000 per bitcoin. Last year, BlackRock’s head of bitcoin and crypto said sovereign wealth funds are showing interest in bitcoin alongside wild speculation that Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund was exploring buying bitcoin.

Subscribe Today's print edition Home Delivery The first step in reducing the risks of climate change is cutting carbon emissions. The world hit a notable milestone on that front, with global energy-related emissions likely peaking last year, according to a recent BloombergNEF report. Now, the world’s carbon pollution is likely to begin a long, inexorable decline over the coming decades. But there’s a catch: Emissions almost certainly won’t fall fast enough to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius, let alone meet the 1.5 C target set in the Paris Agreement. Increasingly, hitting that target looks like it will require the world to turn to technologies that can suck carbon straight from the air in a bid to turn the global thermostat down. Investors have spent years laying the groundwork to develop a sector that has the potential to undergird carbon markets that BNEF estimates could reach $1.1 trillion in the coming decades. Companies from Occidental Petroleum to Microsoft along with firms like BlackRock and Bill Gates’ Breakthrough Energy Ventures are among the investors throwing billions at startups. The U.S. government has been a significant patron, with the Energy Department committing more than $1 billion to get carbon removal off the ground. But funding and buyers of carbon removal services have so far targeted a narrow subset of techniques to clean the atmosphere. And U.S. federal support is now up in the air as the Donald Trump administration pursues funding cuts to all manner of climate programs. This is happening in what is shaping up to be a formative period for the carbon removal industry as companies attempt the perilous journey from pilot projects to commercialization, said Robert Hoglund, co-founder of carbon removal clearinghouse CDR.fyi. To ensure the industry has a fighting chance to reach the scale needed, it will need an enormous financial boost. "If we don’t get new buyers, we’re stuck in the seed stage,” he said. There are at least eight broad categories for removing carbon to clean up the atmosphere, with more than 900 startups trying different approaches. The money that's been rushing into the carbon chase has overwhelmingly backed a technique known as direct air capture (DAC), which involves using machines to suck up carbon. Firms are placing major bets on it even though the technology remains unproven at scale, inordinately expensive and energy intensive. Far less investor money is flowing to competing methods such as sequestering carbon dioxide in the ocean and using crushed rocks, a process known as enhanced weathering. Between 2020 to 2024, firms have bet $3.3 billion on DAC compared to $3.4 billion for all other novel approaches, according to publicly available data compiled by CDR.fyi. The technology receives a disproportionate amount of private investment because it’s backed by U.S. federal tax credits and grants, according to Danny Cullenward, a senior fellow with the University of Pennsylvania Kleinman Center for Energy Policy. That support isn’t because the government decided DAC is the best way to remove carbon, he said, but "because the political economy of the oil and gas industry is much more powerful than these other emerging industries.” Carbon removal buyers looking to meet their climate targets have also not diversified their portfolios. Almost 60% of all purchases tracked by CDR.fyi between 2019 and 2024 are for bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS). It involves burning wood to run power plants, then capturing and sequestering the resulting emissions underground. Hence, the CO2 the trees and plants pull from the atmosphere during their lifetimes stays put. Despite the interest, research has found that cutting down and transporting feedstock can emit more carbon than it sequesters, making carbon accounting a big challenge. BECCS made up about 85% of Microsoft’s 8.2 million metric ton portfolio for novel carbon removal through 2024 tracked by CDR.fyi. The technique "offers attractive costs with an achievable scale inside the 2030 timeline,” said Brian Marrs, the company’s senior director of energy and carbon removal. Bioenergy plants already exist, and retrofitting them for carbon capture is arguably faster than building and scaling novel carbon removal technology. Since 2024, Microsoft has only added to its BECCS portfolio, signing a landmark 6.75 million ton deal with Houston-based developer Fidelis New Energy earlier this month to purchase removal from a plant being built near Baton Rouge, Louisiana. It’s the largest deal for novel carbon removal to date. The company also recently added another 3.7 million ton purchase from CO280 Solutions, which captures CO2 from pulp and paper mills, reflecting Microsoft’s aggressive expansion of its climate commitments. Microsoft takes a "portfolio approach” to procuring carbon removal, balancing costs, deployment timelines and scale potential for different methods, Marrs said, adding that the company also purchases nature-based carbon credits in addition to engineered removals. BECCS’s dominance is not to say DAC or other technologies haven’t seen big purchases. According to CDR.fyi, Oxy subsidiary 1PointFive has sold 1.3 million tons of carbon removal services to companies including Microsoft, Amazon.com and Airbus, making it the largest DAC purveyor. Its next-closest competitors, Heirloom Carbon Technologies and Climeworks, have each sold a bit more than a quarter of that amount. Yet these approaches have yet to live up to their promise. Through 2024, DAC delivered around 1,200 tons of CO2 removal — less than 0.2% of all carbon removed over that time frame — and BECCS has delivered 10,000 tons — less than 1.7% of the total — per CDR.fyi. Just a handful of companies are buying the bulk of carbon removal credits. Microsoft alone is responsible for the majority of carbon removal purchases to date, though Alphabet’s Google and Stripe are also among major buyers. That’s because durable removal isn’t cheap. Using DAC can cost upwards of $1,000 per ton of CO2. Compare that to standard forest carbon credits, which are often sold for under $10. "The only way to make this scale is to make it mandatory,” said Wim Carton, an associate professor of sustainability science at Lund University in Sweden. Carbon removal is a public good governments should treat as akin to a "trash removal service,” said Vikrum Aiyer, Heirloom’s head of global public policy and external affairs. That approach should also include sticks, he added, much like littering results in a fine. But with Trump — who has called former President Joe Biden’s climate legislation "the green new scam” — the odds of the U.S. doubling down on climate regulation are low. What climate scientists want investors and entrepreneurs to understand is that carbon removal has a narrow set of appropriate use cases. The first is cleaning up legacy emissions. Decades of humanity’s CO2 is lingering in the atmosphere, warming the planet. If the Earth were an overflowing bathtub, turning the faucet off — cutting emissions — wouldn’t be enough to stop the water from spilling over. You also need to open the drain. The second use is for the unavoidable, steady drip of CO2 for decades from sectors like agriculture and aviation. All other applications of carbon clean-up technologies could do more harm than good since they risk slowing down emissions cuts today by promising removals down the road, Carton said. That’s especially true for using captured CO2 to extract more fossil fuels, a practice that climate researchers agree needs to be rapidly wound down. Exactly how much carbon the world needs to remove from the atmosphere depends on how quickly that happens. In a scenario where humanity dramatically curbs emissions, scientists estimate that 4.8 billion tons of CO2 removal will be needed annually by mid-century to keep the climate stable with all of it coming from conventional methods like planting trees. In what’s an increasingly likely scenario of continuing to burn fossil fuels, the planet will require almost 9.8 billion tons annually to compensate for the added emissions with 3.5 billion of that from novel techniques like DAC. The world is nowhere near that. Through 2024, about 13 million tons of carbon removal credits have been sold since CDR.fyi began tracking the market for novel carbon removal, what Cullenward called "a rounding error.” The clock is ticking on scaling that up. "We’re far too late, and we’ve eaten up too much of the carbon budget to say that we don’t need it,” said Sabine Fuss, co-chair of the Berlin-based Mercator Research Institute on Global Commons and Climate Change. While DAC and BECCS are attracting the most investment and purchases respectively, they’re crowding out other promising carbon removal technologies. Some startups use clever engineering to accelerate natural processes, like increasing the ocean’s alkalinity. Others are electrolyzing seawater and spreading crushed basalt rock over farmland. These methods promise greater durability, verifiability and effectiveness of storing CO2 than simply planting trees. Another method has provided the majority of all carbon removal delivered: biochar. It’s done so without the support of U.S. tax credits, large purchases from brand-name buyers or billions in investments. In some ways, biochar is the "unrecognized star” of carbon removal, said Carton. Compared to other methods, it’s cheap and doesn’t require much upfront capital expenditure or high-tech research and development. Making it requires kilns to heat biomass, and the resulting charcoal-like product can also be used to help improve soil fertility. But like all carbon removal techniques, there are downsides, the biggest being uncertainty about how much CO2 stays sequestered when it’s added to different soils. That’s an area of active investigation for researchers. "It’s got so much potential, but it’s inconclusive,” said Ben Kolosz, an assistant professor in renewable energy and carbon removal at the University of Hull in the U.K. Still other methods like ocean alkalinity enhancement and enhanced rock weathering hold even greater promise to capture and store vast amounts of CO2. But they are not as "approachable” or "intuitive” as technologies like DAC, which may give investors and would-be buyers pause, said Anu Khan, founder and executive director of the Carbon Removal Standards Initiative. CDR.fyi’s Hoglund compared the carbon removal industry’s efforts to the pharmaceutical industry's pursuit of new drugs. "You need huge upfront investments for it to work,” said Hoglund, who is also the manager of the Milkywire Climate Transformation Fund, an organization that supports carbon removal, decarbonization and nature-based projects. That ultimately means securing committed buyers with deep pockets. "We need many Microsofts to start scaling this,” he said.

Title: Strange sell-off in the dollar raises the specter of investors losing trust in the US under Trump

NEW YORK (AP) — Among the threats tariffs pose to the U.S. economy, none may be as strange as the sell-off in the dollar. Currencies rise and fall all the time because of inflation fears, central bank moves and other factors. But economists worry that the recent drop in the dollar is so dramatic that it reflects something more ominous as President Donald Trump tries to reshape global trade: a loss of confidence in the U.S. The dollar’s dominance in cross-border trade and as a safe haven has been nurtured by administrations of both parties for decades because it helps keep U.S. borrowing costs down and allows Washington to project power abroad — enormous advantages that could possibly disappear if faith in the U.S. was damaged. “Global trust and reliance on the dollar was built up over a half century or more,” says University of California, Berkeley, economist Barry Eichengreen. “But it can be lost in the blink of an eye.” Since mid-January, the dollar has fallen 9% against a basket of currencies, a rare and steep decline, to its lowest level in three years. Many investors spooked by Trump don’t think the dollar will be pushed quickly from its position as the world’s reserve currency, instead expecting more of a slow decline. But even that is scary enough, given the benefits that would be lost. With much of world’s goods exchanged in dollars, demand for the currency has stayed strong even as the U.S. has doubled federal debt in a dozen years and does other things that would normally send investors fleeing. That has allowed the U.S. government, consumers and businesses to borrow at unnaturally low rates, which has helped speed economic growth and lift standards of living. Dollar dominance also allows the U.S. to push around other countries like Venezuela, Iran and Russia by locking them out of a currency they need to buy and sell with others. Now that “exorbitant privilege,” as economists call it, is suddenly at risk. Dollar drop is odd “The safe haven properties of the dollar are being eroded,” said Deutsche Bank in a note to clients earlier this month warning of a “confidence crisis.” Added a more circumspect report by Capital Economics, “It is no longer hyperbole to say that the dollar’s reserve status and broader dominant role is at least somewhat in question.” Traditionally, the dollar would strengthen as tariffs sink demand for foreign products. But the dollar not only failed to strengthen this time, it fell, puzzling economists and hurting consumers. The dollar lost more than 5% against the euro and pound, and 6% against the yen since early April. As any American traveler abroad knows, you can buy more with a stronger dollar and less with a weaker one. Now the price of French wine and South Korean electronics and a host of other imports could cost more not only due to tariffs but a weaker currency, too. And any loss of safe-haven status could hit U.S. consumers in another way: Higher rates for mortgages and car financing deals as lenders demand more interest for the added risk. Federal debt troubles More worrisome is possible higher interest rates on the ballooning U.S. federal debt, which is already at a risky 120% of U.S. annual economic output. “Most countries with that debt to GDP would cause a major crisis and the only reason we get away with it is that the world needs dollars to trade with,” says Benn Steil, an economist at the Council on Foreign Relations. ”At some point people are going to look seriously at alternatives to the dollar. ” They already have, with a little help from a U.S. economic rival. China has been striking yuan-only trading deals with Brazil for agricultural products, Russia for oil and South Korea for other goods for years. It has also been making loans in yuan to central banks desperate for cash in Argentina, Pakistan and other countries, replacing the dollar as the emergency funder of last resort. Another possible U.S. alternative in future years if their market grows: cryptocurrencies. Said BlackRock Chairman Larry Fink in his annual shareholder letter about dollar dominance, ”If deficits keep ballooning, America risks losing that position to digital assets like Bitcoin.” Not everyone is convinced that a big reason the dollar is falling is because of lost faith in the U.S. Steve Ricchiuto, an economist at Mizuho Financial, says dollar weakness reflects anticipation of higher inflation due to tariffs. But even if investors aren’t as comfortable holding dollars, he says, they really don’t have much of a choice. No other currency or other asset, like yuan or bitcoin or gold, is vast enough to handle all the demand. “The U.S. will lose the reserve currency when there is someone out there to take it away,” Ricchiuto says. “Right now there isn’t an alternative.” Erratic policy spooks investors Maybe so, but Trump is testing the limits. It’s not just the tariffs, but the erratic way he’s rolled them out. The unpredictability makes the U.S. seem less stable, less reliable, and a less safe place for their money. There are also questions about his logic justifying the policy. Trump says U.S. tariffs will drive down trade deficits, which he cites as evidence that countries are “ripping off” America. But in calculating the tariffs, he looked at trade deficits only in goods, not services in which the U.S. excels. Most economists think trade deficits are not a sign of national weakness anyway because they do nothing to impede economic growth and prosperity. Trump has also repeatedly threatened to chip away at the independence of the Federal Reserve, raising fears that he will force interest rates lower to boost the economy even if doing so risks stoking runaway inflation. That is a sure fire way to get people to flee the dollar. After Fed Chair Jerome Powell said Wednesday that he would wait to make any rate moves, Trump blasted him, saying “Powell’s termination cannot come fast enough!” Economists critical of Trump’s April 2 tariff announcement recall another event, the Suez Crisis of 1956, that broke the back of the British pound. The military attack on Egypt was poorly planned and badly executed and exposed British political incompetence that sank trust in the country. The pound fell sharply, and its centuries-long position as the dominant trading and reserve currency crumbled. Berkeley’s Eichengreen says Liberation Day, as Trump called April 2, could be remembered as a similar turning point if the president isn’t careful. “This is the first step down a slippery slope where international confidence in the U.S. dollar is lost.” NEW YORK (AP) — Among the threats tariffs pose to the U.S. economy, none may be as strange as the sell-off in the dollar.

The stakes ratchet up in the All-Ireland League on Saturday as the competition shifts from 18 rounds and eight months of league action to the playoffs in all five divisions. In Division 1A only six points separated the top four and there’s little in the way of a form guide judging by previous clashes. St Mary’s College v Cork Constitution, Templeville Road, live on irishrugby+: Promoted St Mary’s have taken the division by storm (witness 13 try-scoring bonus points in 18 games) to earn a home semi-final against the champions. A single point separated them in the table and ditto in their two meetings; a 27-27 draw at Temple Hill in November and Con’s 30-29 win at Templeville Road in January. St Mary’s fielded a weakened side in Clontarf a fortnight ago but Mark McHugh is expected to recall key man Conor Dean at outhalf and summer signings Greg Jones and Dan Goggin. Con make two changes from their 47-45 win over Terenure. Veteran centre Niall Kenneally is restored and, with Mark Donnelly on Munster duty, David Good starts at loosehead. They are seeking to become the first club to retain the AIL title since Shannon in 2006. Clontarf v Lansdowne, Castle Avenue (4pm) Live on irishrugby+: Emulating Clontarf’s astonishing 49-46 win at the same venue in January will be nigh impossible, as a 12-try rollercoaster was won by Conor Kelly’s penalty with the last kick. Clontarf are seeking to regain the title they won in 2022 before losing in the final a year later, and with a largely rebuilt side. They tend to be clinical after gaining access to the opposition’s 22, and that January extravaganza was one of five games that they have won with the last play. They make just one change to the side that sealed a home semi-final by beating St Mary’s a fortnight ago, with Stephen Ryan starting on the left-wing and two players added to their bench as sides are allowed 23-man squads in the knock-out stages. By contrast, Lansdowne rested most of their frontliners for the win over Garryowen a fortnight ago. Hence, Declan Fassbender recalls 11 players, with Charlie Tector starting at inside centre. Lansdowne, who beat ‘Tarf 26-17 at home back in November, have won eight of their last nine matches as they aim for their first final since 2018. The weather may possibly be more to Clontarf’s liking. City of Armagh v UCC, Palace Grounds; Nenagh Ormond v Blackrock College, New Ormond Park: City of Armagh surprisingly slipped into ninth in 1A, whereas UCC climbed into fourth in 1B, on the last day. The students include four recent or current Ireland under-20/Munster academy players in Ben O’Connor, Gene O’Leary Kareem, Seán Odogbu and Michael Foy. Although Nenagh Ormond finished six points above Blackrock, their two wins over them were tight – 38-36 away in September and 21-17 at home three weeks ago. James Blaney is seeking yet another promotion with ‘Rock, who are missing injured Ireland under-20 scrumhalf Oliver Coffey. Cashel v MU Barnhall, Spafield (2.30pm); Dublin University v Greystones, College Park (2.30pm): Cashel and Barnhall also met in last season’s playoffs, the latter winning by two points in Spafield before losing to Queen’s in the playoff final. Barnhall finished second, one point above Cashel, thanks in part to a 30-17 home win over the Tipperary club in January and two bonus points from a 36-33 loss in the February reverse fixture. Trinity are trying to avoid successive relegations and will be favourites at home to Greytones, who finished fourth in 2A. Cashel finished just one point above Barnhall. Dungannon v Clogher Valley, Stevenson Park (2.30pm); Navan v Galwegians, Old Balreask (2.30pm): Navan finished ninth in 2A in their centenary season, and will host Galwegians, who had theirs a year previously, after the Galway club squeezed into fourth in 2B at the end of a fairly luckless campaign in which eight of their nine losses were by a score. Forwards coach Jarrad Butler starts for them, with this season’s Ireland under-20 captain Éanna McCarthy a replacement. Dungannon host Clogher Valley in an Ulster derby after finishing 16 points above them. Midleton v Dolphin, Towns Park (2.30pm); Skerries v Ballyclare, Holmpatrick (2.30pm): Midleton host Dolphin after finishing three pints above their Cork rivals courtesy in part to a 15-all draw away and an 18-13 win in Towns Park. Skerries have to reset their sights on the playoffs after slipping into ninth on the final day by points difference while Ballyclare are in bonus territory at the end of their first AIL season.

Title: XRP ETFs And A Price Surge: What To Expect If The SEC Gives Greenlight

With the anticipation for the approval of XRP ETFs XRP ETFs by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) growing rapidly, the price of the cryptocurrency may be on the cusp of a dramatic surge. According to a crypto analyst, ETFs could become the ideal driver for a continual price rally for the altcoin fueled by a powerful combination of institutional demand and adoption. In a recent podcast, a crypto analyst identified as ‘Good Morning Crypto’ and a speaker on X (formerly Twitter) discussed how the approval and launch of an XRP ETF could positively influence the cryptocurrency’s price. The speaker likened these ETFs to “giant vacuum cleaners” placed over the XRP pool, sucking up all of the available liquidity directly from the asset. Each time someone invests in one of these financial instruments, the XRP used is transferred into a secure custodian and effectively taken out of circulation, no longer available for trading or use. At present, nine companies have officially filed for an XRP ETF in the US. However, these filings are still under review and awaiting approval by the US SEC. Rumors are swirling that BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager with over $11 trillion in Assets Under Management (AUM), may be preparing to announce its own XRP ETF. If true, this move could dramatically speed up both the demand shock and adoption rate of XRP. The influx of investor interest and the shift in sentiment if the SEC greenlights XRP ETF would likely create upward pressure on the cryptocurrency’s price, potentially driving it to new highs. The speaker also illustrated a scenario in which the market gets new US laws and legislation passed by August—things like market infrastructure bills, tax clarity, and stablecoin rules. Once these are settled, he predicts that businesses and financial institutions will begin using XRP for payments. More so, over time, these companies will need to use the network every day to operate. As cryptocurrency becomes increasingly integrated into daily financial activity, companies watch as their ETF counterparts continue buying up the altcoin, contributing to its price growth. In anticipation of an ETF-driven scarcity, businesses may begin acquiring large amounts of XRP in advance, potentially adopting a buy-and-hold strategy before prices climb even higher. This creates what’s known in commodity markets as a “front-loading effect,” where anticipated future price increases lead to aggressive present-day buying. As a result, the analyst believes that the ongoing demand from ETFs and daily users could be “the perfect storm for a price surge.” Now, back in the spotlight, the XRP price is forecasted to experience an explosive breakout to $9.08. According to the Crypto General on X, after recording a significant rally to new highs above $3 this year, the token has been trading within a tight range. A TradingView chart shared by the crypto expert shows the formation of a classic Bull Pennant pattern — a typical continuation signal that often precedes sharp upward movement. The analyst notes that despite the tightening range, the altcoin is moving as planned, with price action respecting key support levels and building pressure below resistance. The key levels on the XRP price chart include a final target of $9.08 and support areas around $1.97 and $0.94. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Canary Capital on Friday filed an S-1 prospectus with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday for a spot Tron ETF that would include staking capabilities. The staking feature of the Canary Staked TRX ETF would allow investors to earn extra yield with their investment. The fund’s “investment objective is to seek to provide exposure to the price of Tron,” the filing said. Nashville, Tennessee-based Canary has filed for a number of crypto ETFs. The fledgling crypto-focused asset manager is hoping Wall Street’s biggest regulator will give the green light to Sui, Pudgy Penguins, and XRP funds. Those applications are part of a flurry of filings for ETFs tracking altcoins, a result of last year’s successful debut of funds tracking Bitcoin and Ethereum’s performance, respectively. The 11 Bitcoin funds have garnered more than $35 billion in net inflows over a 15-month period. The prospectus, also called a registration statement, did not say on which exchange the proposed fund would trade. Staking, the process of pledging proof-of-stake assets to a network to help it function in exchange for rewards, has been a controversial issue in regulators’ consideration of crypto ETFs. Proponents maintain that staking will lead to wider institutional adoption of crypto products, but critics view it as an unnecessary risk for investors. The SEC has yet to approve a staking feature in a crypto ETF, and on Monday, the regulator delayed a decision on a proposed rule change that would enable Grayscale’s spot ETH funds to engage in staking on Ethereum. Tron, which trades as TRX and is the ninth-biggest cryptocurrency with a $23 billion market capitalization, was recently trading at about $0.24, down more than 3% over the past 24 hours. TRX has risen roughly 120% during the past year. The coin runs on its own blockchain, and aims to build a decentralized internet controlled and owned by the individuals who use it. BlackRock, Bitwise, 21Shares and VanEck are among the long list of major fund issuers currently seeking an SEC green light for proposed ETFs tracking different digital assets. Industry analysts have said that XRP and Solana ETFs are the most likely to receive approval next.

Title: Strange sell-off in the dollar raises specter of investors losing trust in U.S. under Trump

JapanToday Sotokanda S Bldg. 4F 5-2-1 Sotokanda Chiyoda-ku Tokyo 101-0021 Japan Tel: +81 3 5829 5900 Fax: +81 3 5829 5919 Email: editor@japantoday.com ©2025 GPlusMedia Inc. Among the threats tariffs pose to the U.S. economy, none may be as strange as the sell-off in the dollar. Currencies rise and fall all the time because of inflation fears, central bank moves and other factors. But economists worry that the recent drop in the dollar is so dramatic that it reflects something more ominous as President Donald Trump tries to reshape global trade: a loss of confidence in the U.S. The dollar's dominance in cross-border trade and as a safe haven has been nurtured by administrations of both parties for decades because it helps keep U.S. borrowing costs down and allows Washington to project power abroad — enormous advantages that could possibly disappear if faith in the U.S. was damaged. “Global trust and reliance on the dollar was built up over a half century or more," says University of California, Berkeley, economist Barry Eichengreen. "But it can be lost in the blink of an eye.” Since mid-January, the dollar has fallen 9% against a basket of currencies, a rare and steep decline, to its lowest level in three years. Many investors spooked by Trump don't think the dollar will be pushed quickly from its position as the world's reserve currency, instead expecting more of a slow decline. But even that is scary enough, given the benefits that would be lost. With much of world's goods exchanged in dollars, demand for the currency has stayed strong even as the U.S. has doubled federal debt in a dozen years and does other things that would normally send investors fleeing. That has allowed the U.S. government, consumers and businesses to borrow at unnaturally low rates, which has helped speed economic growth and lift standards of living. Dollar dominance also allows the U.S. to push around other countries like Venezuela, Iran and Russia by locking them out of a currency they need to buy and sell with others. Now that “exorbitant privilege," as economists call it, is suddenly at risk. "The safe haven properties of the dollar are being eroded," said Deutsch Bank in a note to clients earlier this month warning of a “confidence crisis." Added a more circumspect report by Capital Economics, “It is no longer hyperbole to say that the dollar’s reserve status and broader dominant role is at least somewhat in question." Traditionally, the dollar would strengthen as tariffs sink demand for foreign products. But the dollar not only failed to strengthen this time, it fell, puzzling economists and hurting consumers. The dollar lost more than 5% against the euro and pound, and 6% against the yen since early April. As any American traveler abroad knows, you can buy more with a stronger dollar and less with a weaker one. Now the price of French wine and South Korean electronics and a host of other imports could cost more not only due to tariffs but a weaker currency, too. And any loss of safe-haven status could hit U.S. consumers in another way: Higher rates for mortgages and car financing deals as lenders demand more interest for the added risk. More worrisome is possible higher interest rates on the ballooning U.S. federal debt, which is already at a risky 120% of U.S. annual economic output. “Most countries with that debt to GDP would cause a major crisis and the only reason we get away with it is that the world needs dollars to trade with,” says Benn Steil, an economist at the Council on Foreign Relations. ”At some point people are going to look seriously at alternatives to the dollar. ” They already have, with a little help from a U.S. economic rival. China has been striking yuan-only trading deals with Brazil for agricultural products, Russia for oil and South Korea for other goods for years. It has also been making loans in yuan to central banks desperate for cash in Argentina, Pakistan and other countries, replacing the dollar as the emergency funder of last resort. Another possible U.S. alternative in future years if their market grows: cryptocurrencies. Said BlackRock Chairman Larry Fink in his annual shareholder letter about dollar dominance, ”If deficits keep ballooning, America risks losing that position to digital assets like Bitcoin.” Not everyone is convinced that a big reason the dollar is falling is because of lost faith in the U.S. Steve Ricchiuto, an economist at Mizuho Financial, says dollar weakness reflects anticipation of higher inflation due to tariffs. But even if investors aren’t as comfortable holding dollars, he says, they really don't have much of a choice. No other currency or other asset, like yuan or bitcoin or gold, is vast enough to handle all the demand. “The U.S. will lose the reserve currency when there is someone out there to take it away," Ricchiuto says. "Right now there isn’t an alternative.” Maybe so, but Trump is testing the limits. It's not just the tariffs, but the erratic way he’s rolled them out. The unpredictability makes the U.S. seem less stable, less reliable, and a less safe place for their money. There are also questions about his logic justifying the policy. Trump says the U.S. needs tariffs to drive down its trade deficits with other countries. But most economists believe those deficits, which measure trade in goods, not services, are a bad measure of whether a country is “ripping off” America, as Trump puts it. Trump has also repeatedly threatened to chip away at the independence of the Federal Reserve, raising fears that he will force interest rates lower to boost the economy even if doing so risks stoking runaway inflation. That is a sure fire way to get people to flee the dollar. After Fed Chair Jerome Powell said Wednesday that he would wait to make any rate moves, Trump blasted him, saying “Powell’s termination cannot come fast enough!” Economists critical of Trump’s April 2 tariff announcement recall another event, the Suez Crisis of 1956, that broke the back of the British pound. The military attack on Egypt was poorly planned and badly executed and exposed British political incompetence that sank trust in the country. The pound fell sharply, and its centuries-long position as the dominant trading and reserve currency crumbled. Berkeley’s Eichengreen says Liberation Day, as Trump called it, could be remembered as a similar turning point if the president isn't careful. “This is the first step down a slippery slope where international confidence in the U.S. dollar is lost." Join the leading Asian tourist attraction to assist our diverse range of customers! Good news for most of us here in Japan. It's still a long ways to go, and the fundamentals, like the interest rate differential, could get even worse, as Powell signals inflation ahead and the BOJ's darkening outlook for Japan's economy. . demand for the currency has stayed strong even as the U.S. has doubled federal debt The writer is ignorant. Large or growing fiscal debts by major economies with sovereign currencies make no difference to investors. Strange sell-off in the dollar raises specter of investors losing trust in U.S. under Trump The only ones who aren't "losing trust in US under Trump" are his insane cult members. All part of China’s long term plan! They could blow up the US economy if they sold all their dollar holdings. They have just been waiting for the right time. Golds recent meteoric rise is no coincidence either! ...I would have thought a nations debt level and ability to service that debt would be a forefront issue with investors. I recall Argentina in the early 80s defaulting on many outside loans, seeing a drop in incoming investment as the country spiraled into hyperinflation. Well, if the dollar falls a lot, it will be easier to sell products, and normally, but maybe not this time, we could expect lots of tourists. However, if everyone who looks foreign ìs being deported or abused, it's not a welcoming feeling for those tourists. Just investors? Everyone has lost trust in this Loser - if they ever had any... Especially all those that voted for him and are now jobless, their retirement gutted, and headed toward poverty... STRS is epidemic in Red States - Sudden Trump Remorse Syndrome... American spend money so.fast,they have no idea of it real value More and more Americans are blaming the Financial Felon and Fool for our economy tanking... Tanking - like his poll numbers... "Americans are starting to see through Donald Trump’s economic promises as he continues to tank the economy with his volatile approach to global trade. A new poll from The Economist/YouGov, conducted April 13–15, shows that Trump’s economic approval is at an all-time low. Fifty-two percent of respondents said the economy is getting worse, up 5 percent from “Liberation Day,” when Trump implemented reciprocal tariffs of 10 percent or more on about 90 countries, sending stock markets plummeting to a generational low. He then rescinded the majority of those tariffs days later (but increased the ones on China), causing confusion and chaos for consumers and small-business owners. Three-quarters of voters said they thought tariffs “will increase the price of goods they buy,” and about two-thirds of Americans think the state of the stock market is Trump’s fault, according to the YouGov poll." The Euro is the only currency big enough to really share the dollar's position as a means of exchange in international markets. Given that the ISA is no longer part of "the West" in the traditional sense, itay be appropriate to plan a transition to the eurozone's currency. I have read MAGA will remain enamoured as long as the people they dont like are getting hurt. The USG is no longer reliable or trustworthy. Policies change daily. It is ruled by the executive orders of someone you wouldn't buy a used car from. Brexit took 25% off Sterling. There is no reason why Trump's ideological idiocy shouldn't do the same to the US dollar. Which would be good news for the rest of us. The dollar will be “replaced” with…what? oh it won’t be? Ok. This is part of Trump's "master plan". He wants a weaker dollar to make us goods cheaper abroad and increase exports boosting US manufacturing. There is some logic to this but I along with many others are doubtful it will be very successful. The dollar was 110-115 yen for years and was fine. what’s the dollar/yen rate now that is causing such concern? 142 you say? lol The US Bank will be broke, American will not have access to their money If all creditors to the US called for repayment, the US could not comply. Sounds broke already. Watching gold prices is a good indicator of investor sentiment . All part of China’s long term plan! They could blow up the US economy if they sold all their dollar holdings. You have the wrong country. It isn't China that is selling off bonds, but rather something orchestrated by the new Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney in cooperation with the key EU economies and Japan. https://lawandsocietymagazine.com/carneys-checkmate-how-canadas-quiet-bond-play-forced-trump-to-drop-tariffs/ And obtw, if you think what Mark Carney is doing with his slow bleed bond sell off isn't noticed by the US consider that Jupiter hasn't dared call him "governor" or made any more jokes about Canada as a 51st state. Mark Carney is a central banker. He knows what he is doing is hurting the US. He's squeezing Jupiter like a lemon. Jupiter has to tread carefully with him because he is one wily Canadian with the chops to do some real harm. The only ones who aren't "losing trust in US under Trump" are his insane cult members. Yes, so insane, we kept winning when the left said, we are losing and we are a cult and insane, strange Other countries aren't stupid: they see the US is being led by a belligerent idiot and they don't want any exposure to that. BlacklabelToday 08:52 am JST The dollar will be “replaced” with…what? oh it won’t be? Ok. It's going to be replaced overseas with the Euro and the Yuan. SanjinosebleedToday 07:17 am JST All part of China’s long term plan! They could blow up the US economy if they sold all their dollar holdings That would blow up their own economy as well and not just from getting pennies on the dollar for what they are selling. It's going to be replaced overseas with the Euro and the Yuan. and when will this supposedly happen? didn’t the yuan recently hit a near 20 year low against the “weakened” US dollar? Also, obvious most commodities, other than Gold and a few 'safe haven' types, selling off, putting pressure on DXY or dollar index. Ending global wars helps currencies relative to commodities, dollar less so given its run-up Many factors for US dollar weakening. BIG one is reductions to US Govt. Spending coming soon with DJT's first budget starting Oct 1st. Speaker Johnson has promised to cut US Govt. spending "by at LEAST $800 Billion", that's going to help lower US inflation and US interest rates. How will he achieve such spending cuts? Speaker Johnson's working closely with Elon Musk and DOGE and believes the Social Security Programs to include Medicare and Medicaid can eliminate payments made to those who are not illegible ($fraudsters) and illegal Aliens not entitled to receive such benefits. Another factor putting pressure on US dollar is US Govt. headcount reductions, +10% of civilian workforce already reduced with more on the way and many agencies seeing their budgets cut, especially NGO monies. Reducing US Govt. bond issuance to finance Govt. deficit = lower interest rates, inflation, thus weaker US$ Anyone interested in HOW US Govt. will massively cut its spending, thus weakening US$ via lower interest rates and inflation, should carefully listen to Elon Musk explain on Tucker Carlson's March Podcast, Part 1, fascinating stuff should carefully listen to Elon Musk explain on Tucker Carlson's March podcast Louder with Crowder and Tucker Carlson recommendations. Sometimes you think we deserve the giant asteroid. Leave the place to the invertebrates. Not just a weakening dollar, bond markets are teetering and the that stock market keeps on sliding sliding sliding. His diehard fans won't be convinced until their 401ks are completely empty and they have no social security. Bond markets teetering? Interest rates have dropped substantially since Jan 20th, especially short duration, as inflation is now the lowest since DJT 1.0. That's called a bond market rally! should carefully listen to Elon Musk explain on Tucker Carlson's March podcast Louder with Crowder and Tucker Carlson recommendations. Sometimes you think we deserve the giant asteroid. Leave the place to the invertebrates. No need for insults, currency markets carefully tracking Elon Musk and his DOGE advisory efforts to reduce large US Govt. structural deficits, thus reducing US Govt. bond issuance, interest rates, inflation = weaker US$ Most believe Elon Musk is no fool and worth listening to. Most Americans strongly approve of DOGE's efforts to improve US Govt. efficiency and will really approve when DOGE issues taxpayers $5K Refund Checks next Year! It’s not strange at all! It has to do with lack of TRUST. Money confiscation is a thing in the US not only domestically but internationally too. https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-treasury-sanctions-assets-congress-0a3bc97a2d6d77ce3650c767db6ea7ed Putting money at risk has a distinct unsettling effect…. The weaponization of the dollar caused it to cease being a safe haven. I cannot imagine owning Chinese Communist Party Yuan instead of US dollars anytime soon. I did sell some US bonds recently, but that was only so that I could use the money to buy stocks while they are cheap. Trump gas had it wrong on tariffs and is eagerly trying to make deals in three to four weeks with everyone, so history is going to show that this recent dip in US assets including the dollar was a good buying opportunity. But I won't be selling any of my gold. That is the only alternative out there, and probably that's why it's gone from the 1,800 - 2,000 range to 3,300 USD in recent years. As an investor I like what I see in terms of the spending restraint plans coming out of the US government The dollar will be “replaced” with…what? oh it won’t be? Ok. That was a mic drop! It’s not strange at all! It has to do with lack of TRUST. Money confiscation is a thing in the US not only domestically but internationally too. Elon Musk's making himself available, via several hours of interviews with Tucker Carlson, via DOGE. That's transparency, something that's been sorely missing. Why DOGE's digital audit's so important, as now we finally have actual transparency, hard data. Govt. IT being modernized as result to reduce such Govt. financial 'control' issues moving forward. US taxpayers overwhelmingly support DOGE's mission. US$ very connected to interest rates, inflation and Govt. Deficits, caused by wasteful Govt. $spending. Speaker Johnson working now closely working with DOGE, Elon Musk, and has announced huge cuts to Govt. spending starting in Oct this year as a result. Most Americans and Financial Markets distrusted US Govt. and now due to DOGE are gaining TRUST due to the daily objective transparency regarding their findings. Reducing US Govt. Spending by making it more efficient, reducing waste, fraud and abuse due to DOGE will greatly strengthen long-term TRUST in the US$ and act to protect the credit rating of the America. 55% of Americans disapprove of Trump's tariffs and lack of economic progress. A survey of 1000 Americans showed Trump with a 43% approval and a 55% disapproval rating on his handling of the economy. Gee, 'a survey of 1,000 Americans' shows zip, zero, nada regardless of what you think of Trump. The US has around 330 million people, some of you need to take time out from your political hatreds and think in a rational way. Quoting that 'statistic' as some kind of authoritative judgement is just symptomatic of the fact that many people cannot have a grown up debate and discussion about politics anymore. But but but 1,000 people outta 330 million think/say......................... Moribund currency. Oh, all my income is in US Dolor,(pain). Trump loses public support during his first 3 months in office https://www.brookings.edu/articles/trump-loses-public-support-during-his-first-3-months-in-office/ Trump is pursuing big agenda items regarding the US$ and US economy and naturally voters are waiting for results regarding US Govt. efficiency due to DOGE advisory and trade and tariff policies to promote US manufacturing re-shoring and far reciprocal trade. US voters know DJT has an economic plan, versus Biden and Harris who had no plan. However, DJT's plan is now being implemented, so results will take time, including major US Govt. budget negotiations now under way. Given above, not surprising US$ has weakened, too much uncertainty remains, currency markets like US voters, waiting for results! I cannot imagine owning Chinese Communist Party Yuan instead of US dollars anytime soon. You don't have to. There are increasing number of nations in the world that detest everything the US represents who are interested in an alternative to trading with the US Dollar. You might be surprised how hated the US is outside its borders. Trump is pursuing big agenda items regarding the US$ and US economy and naturally voters are waiting for results regarding US Govt. efficiency due to DOGE advisory and trade and tariff policies to promote US manufacturing re-shoring and far reciprocal trade. Jupiter and his advisors don't have the slightest idea how macroeconomics works. Their laughable "tariff" calculation used a wildly inaccurate elasticity value in the denominator of 0.25 when the true value used by actual practicing economists is closer to 0.97. What that difference means is that the "tariffs" that are not the actual tariffs imposed by US trade partners but rather a measure of the trade balance, is high by a factor of four. Done with the correct elasticity value that stated "tariffs" should be a quarter of what they are. This is just one example of the bumbling incompetence of the people who surround Jupiter, put there not for their expertise but because they will fawn over him and do as they are told. And you have fallen for their flim flam. Meanwhile Mark Carney, someone who lives and breathes macroeconomics knows how to tighten the screws on the US and is doing so in cooperation with other nations. The US does not come out of this better than it was before tariffs. fxgaiApr. 20 05:04 pm JST As an investor I like what I see in terms of the spending restraint plans coming out of the US government Completely ham handed slashing at things for political reasons?

Thank you. Please check your inbox to confirm. Bernard Condon, Associated Press Bernard Condon, Associated Press Leave your feedback NEW YORK (AP) — Among the threats tariffs pose to the U.S. economy, none may be as strange as the sell-off in the dollar. Currencies rise and fall all the time because of inflation fears, central bank moves and other factors. But economists worry that the recent drop in the dollar is so dramatic that it reflects something more ominous as President Donald Trump tries to reshape global trade: a loss of confidence in the U.S. The dollar’s dominance in cross-border trade and as a safe haven has been nurtured by administrations of both parties for decades because it helps keep U.S. borrowing costs down and allows Washington to project power abroad — enormous advantages that could possibly disappear if faith in the U.S. was damaged. READ MORE: What is the bond market, and why does it matter for the economy? “Global trust and reliance on the dollar was built up over a half century or more,” says University of California, Berkeley, economist Barry Eichengreen. “But it can be lost in the blink of an eye.” Since mid-January, the dollar has fallen 9 percent against a basket of currencies, a rare and steep decline, to its lowest level in three years. Many investors spooked by Trump don’t think the dollar will be pushed quickly from its position as the world’s reserve currency, instead expecting more of a slow decline. But even that is scary enough, given the benefits that would be lost. With much of world’s goods exchanged in dollars, demand for the currency has stayed strong even as the U.S. has doubled federal debt in a dozen years and does other things that would normally send investors fleeing. That has allowed the U.S. government, consumers and businesses to borrow at unnaturally low rates, which has helped speed economic growth and lift standards of living. Dollar dominance also allows the U.S. to push around other countries like Venezuela, Iran and Russia by locking them out of a currency they need to buy and sell with others. Now that “exorbitant privilege,” as economists call it, is suddenly at risk. “The safe haven properties of the dollar are being eroded,” said Deutsche Bank in a note to clients earlier this month warning of a “confidence crisis.” Added a more circumspect report by Capital Economics, “It is no longer hyperbole to say that the dollar’s reserve status and broader dominant role is at least somewhat in question.” Traditionally, the dollar would strengthen as tariffs sink demand for foreign products. But the dollar not only failed to strengthen this time, it fell, puzzling economists and hurting consumers. The dollar lost more than 5 percent against the euro and pound, and 6 percent against the yen since early April. As any American traveler abroad knows, you can buy more with a stronger dollar and less with a weaker one. Now the price of French wine and South Korean electronics and a host of other imports could cost more not only due to tariffs but a weaker currency, too. And any loss of safe-haven status could hit U.S. consumers in another way: Higher rates for mortgages and car financing deals as lenders demand more interest for the added risk. More worrisome is possible higher interest rates on the ballooning U.S. federal debt, which is already at a risky 120 percent of U.S. annual economic output. “Most countries with that debt to GDP would cause a major crisis and the only reason we get away with it is that the world needs dollars to trade with,” says Benn Steil, an economist at the Council on Foreign Relations. ”At some point people are going to look seriously at alternatives to the dollar. ” They already have, with a little help from a U.S. economic rival. China has been striking yuan-only trading deals with Brazil for agricultural products, Russia for oil and South Korea for other goods for years. It has also been making loans in yuan to central banks desperate for cash in Argentina, Pakistan and other countries, replacing the dollar as the emergency funder of last resort. Another possible U.S. alternative in future years if their market grows: cryptocurrencies. Said BlackRock Chairman Larry Fink in his annual shareholder letter about dollar dominance, ”If deficits keep ballooning, America risks losing that position to digital assets like Bitcoin.” Not everyone is convinced that a big reason the dollar is falling is because of lost faith in the U.S. Steve Ricchiuto, an economist at Mizuho Financial, says dollar weakness reflects anticipation of higher inflation due to tariffs. But even if investors aren’t as comfortable holding dollars, he says, they really don’t have much of a choice. No other currency or other asset, like yuan or bitcoin or gold, is vast enough to handle all the demand. “The U.S. will lose the reserve currency when there is someone out there to take it away,” Ricchiuto says. “Right now there isn’t an alternative.” Maybe so, but Trump is testing the limits. It’s not just the tariffs, but the erratic way he’s rolled them out. The unpredictability makes the U.S. seem less stable, less reliable, and a less safe place for their money. There are also questions about his logic justifying the policy. Trump says U.S. tariffs will drive down trade deficits, which he cites as evidence that countries are “ripping off” America. But in calculating the tariffs, he looked at trade deficits only in goods, not services in which the U.S. excels. Most economists think trade deficits are not a sign of national weakness anyway because they do nothing to impede economic growth and prosperity. Trump has also repeatedly threatened to chip away at the independence of the Federal Reserve, raising fears that he will force interest rates lower to boost the economy even if doing so risks stoking runaway inflation. That is a sure fire way to get people to flee the dollar. After Fed Chair Jerome Powell said Wednesday that he would wait to make any rate moves, Trump blasted him, saying “Powell’s termination cannot come fast enough!” Economists critical of Trump’s April 2 tariff announcement recall another event, the Suez Crisis of 1956, that broke the back of the British pound. The military attack on Egypt was poorly planned and badly executed and exposed British political incompetence that sank trust in the country. The pound fell sharply, and its centuries-long position as the dominant trading and reserve currency crumbled. Berkeley’s Eichengreen says Liberation Day, as Trump called April 2, could be remembered as a similar turning point if the president isn’t careful. “This is the first step down a slippery slope where international confidence in the U.S. dollar is lost.” Your tax-deductible donation ensures our vital reporting continues to thrive.

Title: Coinbase and traditional financial firms poised to benefit from US stablecoin legislation

Firms such as PayPal, Visa, and Mastercard could have direct benefits, while Charles Schwab and BlackRock could gain indirectly. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. The passage of the Stablecoin Transparency and Accountability for a Better Ledger Economy (STABLE) Act would substantially benefit major regulated players in the US financial and crypto sectors, according to a Nansen report. The firm highlighted that the STABLE Act’s licensing and reserve requirements create a regulatory moat favoring established institutions already aligned with US compliance standards. Additionally, the report predicted that Coinbase could be among the biggest winners in crypto. As a major distributor of USDC and a partner of Circle, the exchange’s model already fits the regulatory vision for fiat-backed stablecoins. Coinbase’s custody and exchange operations may also see expanded demand for compliant storage solutions and increased liquidity consolidation. The STABLE Act proposes establishing a comprehensive federal framework for payment stablecoins, restricting issuance to licensed entities, and requiring full backing with cash or short-term Treasury securities. Payment companies such as PayPal, which issued PYUSD in collaboration with Paxos, are positioned to leverage new regulatory clarity to expand stablecoin-enabled payment services across peer-to-peer transfers, e-commerce, and cross-border transactions. Visa and Mastercard, which previously piloted stablecoin settlement projects, could further integrate regulated stablecoins into B2B payments, treasury management, and real-time settlement layers. Traditional custodians, including BNY Mellon and State Street, as well as infrastructure providers like Nasdaq, are poised to benefit from the demand for custody and compliance services. BNY Mellon’s relationship with Circle, managing USDC reserves, is a model for this emerging service line. Meanwhile, asset managers, like BlackRock and Charles Schwab, are also expected to benefit indirectly. As regulated stablecoin issuers park reserves in government money market funds, these firms may see increased inflows. BlackRock, which already manages USDC reserves, could expand its role in this area. The report notes that international firms such as Payoneer, MUFG, and Nomura may also benefit from using compliant stablecoin infrastructure for cross-border US dollar-denominated transfers. In contrast, decentralized stablecoins such as DAI, crvUSD, and GHO, which do not meet the Act’s definition of payment stablecoins, face a diminished role within US markets. These tokens will likely shift activity offshore, explore legal workarounds, or operate in a regulatory gray zone. The report expects lending protocols like Aave and Compound to adapt by prioritizing compliant stablecoins in their US offerings. At the same time, DEXs like Uniswap and Curve will need to geofence or de-emphasize pools tied to non-compliant assets. The STABLE Act also bans direct interest payments to stablecoin holders, restricting yield-bearing stablecoins like the Origin Dollar (OUSD) unless they register as securities with the SEC. As a result, the future stablecoin market may favor tokenized money market funds and compliant DeFi lending products.

It’s not just the tariffs, but the erratic way he’s rolled them out. The unpredictability makes the U.S. seem less stable, less reliable, and a less safe place for their money. There are also questions about his logic justifying the policy. Trump says U.S. tariffs will drive down trade deficits, which he cites as evidence that countries are “ripping off” America. But in calculating the tariffs, he looked at trade deficits only in goods, not services in which the U.S. excels. Most economists think trade deficits are not a sign of national weakness anyway because they do nothing to impede economic growth and prosperity. Trump has also repeatedly threatened to chip away at the independence of the Federal Reserve, raising fears that he will force interest rates lower to boost the economy even if doing so risks stoking runaway inflation. That is a sure fire way to get people to flee the dollar. After Fed Chair Jerome Powell said Wednesday that he would wait to make any rate moves, Trump blasted him, saying “Powell’s termination cannot come fast enough!” Economists critical of Trump’s April 2 tariff announcement recall another event, the Suez Crisis of 1956, that broke the back of the British pound. The military attack on Egypt was poorly planned and badly executed and exposed British political incompetence that sank trust in the country. The pound fell sharply, and its centuries-long position as the dominant trading and reserve currency crumbled. Berkeley’s Eichengreen says Liberation Day, as Trump called April 2, could be remembered as a similar turning point if the president isn’t careful. “This is the first step down a slippery slope where international confidence in the U.S. dollar is lost.”

Friday, April 18th, 2025 As the Western hemisphere wound down trading activity with the onset of the Easter holidays, crude oil markets have posted an impressive 7% week-on-week rise, with ICE Brent now back at $68 per barrel. New OPEC+ compensation quotas, tighter US sanctions on Iran, and relatively upbeat March macro data have all boosted sentiment in the short term, although further US-China escalation could upend this week’s recovery.

The Trump Administration issued new sanctions to curb Iran’s oil exports, including the Shengxing Chemical teapot refinery based in Shandong province for purchasing more than $1 billion worth of Iranian crude, the second Chinese refiner to be hit with direct sanctions.

Mauritania Exports Its First Ever Gas Cargo.

Bahrain Resumes LNG Imports. Despite being a producer of oil and sharing a huge oil field with Saudi Arabia, the Middle Eastern kingdom of Bahrain is set to resume importing LNG after a five-year hiatus, with a 170,000 m3 cargo from the US Sabine Pass LNG facility moving towards the Arab Gulf. Europe Has Now Only Two Russian Buyers.

Congo Taps Blackwater Know-How. Erik Prince, the founder of private military firm Blackwater, has allegedly signed an agreement with the Democratic Republic of Congo to secure the country’s vast metal reserves and reduce cross-border smuggling of commodities amidst ongoing warfare in Eastern Congo.

Force Majeure Saps Malaysia’s LNG Supply. Malaysia’s Petronas, operator of the giant 29.3 mtpa Bintulu LNG export terminal, is experiencing production issues due to boiler malfunction, setting a pricing floor for Asia’s JKM gas futures that are set to rebound from their 9-month low of $12 per mmBtu. China Hits New Coal Record. China posted another all-time high in coal production as the March supply totals amounted to 440.6 million tonnes, up 9.6% from a year ago, worsening the country’s coal oversupply and forcing power utilities to cut their coal imports by 6% month-over-month in March. Refiners Flee California Regulatory Hell. US refining giant Valero Energy (NYSE:VLO) filed its request to ‘idle, restructure or cease’ operations at its 170,000 b/d Benicia refinery next to San Francisco by April 2026, marking the second refinery closure in California in less than a year amidst rising regulatory costs. America’s Copper Dream Is On.
