We recently published an article titled These 10 Firms Led This Week's Rally. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Capri Holdings Ltd. (NYSE:CPRI) stands against the other stocks. Ten companies finished stronger this week, outpacing the broader market thanks to a series of catalysts that lifted investor sentiment. On Friday, the Dow Jones recorded its largest weekly drop, falling 1.07%, while the S&P's main index and Nasdaq declined by 0.71% and 0.62%, respectively. Despite a lackluster performance from Wall Street’s major indices, 10 companies demonstrated notable resilience. In this article, we will look at their past week's performance and the reasons that fueled their rally. To come up with this week's top gainers, we considered only the stocks with at least $2 billion in market capitalization and $5 million in daily trading volume.

(NYSE:CPRI) increased by 14.65 percent week-on-week, ending at $23.71 as compared with the $20.68 finish the week prior. Investor sentiment was buoyed by news that Prada was looking to acquire Capri Holdings’ Versace brand. According to reports, the company has already engaged financial and legal advisers to look into the potential deal to decide whether to pursue such a plan. Meanwhile, Capri Holdings Ltd. (NYSE:CPRI) was also said to have hired Barclays to explore options for the label and other brands in its portfolio that would include Jimmy Choo. Prada emerged as one of the winners amid a rare broader luxury sector downturn, having pushed its sales higher in the third quarter of 2024 thanks to the strong performance of its Miu Miu brand, which is enjoying rising popularity among the young market. Overall CPRI ranks 7th on our list of the firms that led this week's rally. While we acknowledge the potential of CPRI as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Jim Cramer’s Latest Lightning Round: Top 10 Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Dell Technologies Inc. (NYSE:DELL) stands against other top stocks from Jim Cramer’s Latest Lightning Round. Jim Cramer in a recent program on CNBC recommended investors to avoid worrying when others are anxious or get too excited about something when others are also doing the same. Cramer said by the time an idea is common among investors, its price already reflects its potential. “Stocks don’t quite travel at the speed of thought but they come pretty close. So the moment a preponderance of hedge fund and mutual fund managers decide that the economy is slowing, speeding up, or flatlining, stocks start trading like that’s already the case. Usually, it takes some time to build that kind of consensus, which is why you rarely see these moves happening instantaneously. But once the big institutional portfolio managers are on the same page about something, you can be pretty darn confident that it’s baked into the averages. This is some basic economics 101 stuff.” If every piece of news is priced in, does that mean it’s meaningless to invest in stocks and you are better off putting your money in broader market funds? Cramer calls this idea “bogus” and says the market is pretty irrational at times and stocks are incorrectly priced, giving investors an opportunity. “The simple truth is that markets are not perfectly efficient. In fact, frankly, they’re often irrational. They ignore things, make mistakes, misvalue information every day. And that’s a major reason why anyone can make money picking individual stocks. These anomalies are everywhere, and they can be great for your portfolio,” Cramer added.

With each stock, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Stock market data on a laptop screen. Photo by Alesia Kozik Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 60 Jim Cramer was recently asked about his thoughts on Dell Technologies Inc. (NYSE:DELL). Here is what he said: “Dell Technologies Inc. (NYSE:DELL) did not have a good quarter. It really was a disappointing quarter. I agree with people, even though I think the world of Michael Dell Technologies Inc. (NYSE:DELL). However, I think Dell’s second half will be much better. I do not think much of its first half. If you have the patience to own the stock here, I don’t think there’s a lot of downside, and I think there’s a lot of upside. However, we own other stocks in the portfolio that I think are better, even at this price. Do you know that I actually like Nvidia at 134 more than I like Dell? Just saying.” In the most recently reported quarter, Dell’s Infrastructure Solutions Group (ISG) posted an impressive 34% year-over-year growth, reaching $11.4 billion in revenue. The server business rose a whopping 58% increase YoY to $7.4 billion. Dell Tech Inc (NYSE:DELL) experienced a shift in AI server demand toward the next-generation Blackwell architecture. Dell Tech Inc (NYSE:DELL)’s management highlighted that there was a dramatic shift in orders toward Nvidia’s (NVDA) Blackwell-based systems during Q3, which impacted short-term shipments as these products ramp up production. This shift shows Dell Tech Inc (NYSE:DELL)’s competitive position, as customers are willing to wait for the latest tech solutions. Dell secured $3.6 billion in AI server orders this quarter, an 11% increase from the previous quarter. Dell Tech Inc (NYSE:DELL) also signed over 2,000 enterprise customers for their AI solutions. Carillon Scout Mid Cap Fund stated the following regarding Dell Technologies Inc. (NYSE:DELL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter: “Dell Technologies Inc. (NYSE:DELL) was a top contributor despite reporting disappointing first-quarter earnings results, because investors looked through the near-term disappointment and expected strong growth from AI-related servers and personal computers. We expect Dell to participate in the growth of artificial intelligence hardware, especially as enterprises invest more aggressively. We like the company’s depth and breadth of products and services, as well as its focus on keeping costs low.” Overall, DELL ranks 7th on our list of top stocks from Jim Cramer’s Latest Lightning Round. While we acknowledge the potential of DELL, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than DELL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: BlackRock Builds $50,000,000,000 Bitcoin (BTC) Trove in Just 12 Months, According to Arkham

New data from market intelligence firm Arkham reveals that asset management titan BlackRock has built a $50 billion stash of Bitcoin (BTC) in 2024. The data also finds that software firm MicroStrategy, founded by BTC maxi Michael Saylor, bought $24 billion worth of the crypto king last year while financial services giant Fidelity accumulated $20 billion worth of BTC. Other notable digital assets in BlackRock’s portfolio include $3.6 billion worth of top altcoin Ethereum (ETH) and $68.5 million worth of the stablecoin USDC. However, Arkham goes on to note that BlackRock – which has over $10 trillion in assets under its management – isn’t accumulating the top crypto asset by market cap anymore. Rather, it has reversed course and is unloading BTC in the short term. Earlier this month, it was reported that BlackRock’s spot market BTC exchange-traded fund (ETF) saw a record number of outflows. At the time, it was found that the firm’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) witnessed $332.6 million worth of outflows on January 2nd, the largest day on record. In November, it was found that IBIT had surpassed BlackRock’s gold ETF (IAU) in terms of net assets – reaching over $33 billion – despite the gold ETF launching nearly two decades earlier in 2005. The flagship digital asset is trading for $94,201 at time of writing, a 1.1% decrease during the last 24 hours.

We recently compiled a list of the Best Medical Stocks To Buy Under $20. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Bausch Health Companies Inc. (NYSE:BHC) stands against the other best medical stocks under $20. The medical industry plays a crucial role in ensuring the health and safety of populations. Driven by advancements in medical technology and an aging population, the medical and healthcare industry is expected to grow significantly in the coming years. READ ALSO: 10 Best Low Priced Technology Stocks To Buy Now and 8 Undervalued Insurance Stocks To Invest In. According to Deloitte’s 2024 Global Healthcare Sector Outlook, the use of technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) is rising in the healthcare sector. Healthcare providers and technology companies are introducing various kinds of AI tools that can help improve clinical outcomes. These technological advancements can streamline various administrative tasks while also enhancing the quality of care provided to patients. In the US, healthcare costs and spending have been rising. As reported by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, healthcare spending in the United States reached $4.9 trillion in 2023, reflecting a 7.5% increase from 2022. In 2023, the healthcare sector accounted for 17.6% of the US economy in 2023, up from 17.4% in 2022. Rise in private health insurance and Medicare were the two main drivers of this growth. Donald Trump nominated Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to serve as the next Secretary of Health and Human Services, a role that covers various aspects of public health, including medical research and food safety. If confirmed, Kennedy would oversee key agencies like the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). In an NPR interview in November, Kennedy said that Trump had tasked him with eliminating corruption in health agencies, restoring evidence-based practices, and addressing the chronic disease epidemic. It’s not clear how Kennedy’s nomination could impact the healthcare sector as his specific policies are not yet clear and he has yet to receive confirmation by the US Senate. Chris Schott, JPMorgan’s healthcare analyst, pointed out in a note to clients that the industry is currently experiencing “a period of max uncertainty” until the position is filled. However, Schott noted that this situation also means that the large-cap stocks are currently trading at a 35% discount to the S&P 500, presenting a significant opportunity for growth. Jared Holz, Mizuho’s healthcare expert, said in a note to clients that he acknowledges some of Kennedy’s concerns, such as America’s obesity epidemic and the risks associated with ultra-processed foods. Holz noted that this is a complicated topic but emphasized that there is substantial room for improvement in public health. However, Kennedy is known as an anti-vaxxer and this has concerned some Wall Street analysts about his possible effect on the vaccine industry. He has also expressed skepticism about GLP-1s, which he believes are not the solution to the obesity problem. Additionally, Kennedy has advocated for stricter regulations on ultra-processed foods, which are linked to rising obesity rates in the country. To compile our list of the 12 best medical stocks to buy under $20, we used the Finviz stock screener. We sorted our results based on market capitalization and picked the top 30 medical companies with a share price of under $20 as of January 8, 2024. Next, we focused on the top 12 stocks most favored by institutional investors. Data for the hedge fund sentiment surrounding each stock was taken from Insider Monkey’s Q3 2024 database of 900 elite hedge funds. The 12 best medical stocks to invest in were then ranked in ascending order based on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them as of Q3 2024. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

Title: The Global Net Zero Financial Cartel, Falling Apart

Skip to comments. Posted on 01/12/2025 6:04:58 AM PST by MtnClimber Less than three weeks ago, on December 23, in a post on optimism about the potential demise of the green energy fantasy, I took note that two of the largest U.S. banks had just quit something called the “Net Zero Banking Alliance.” The two were Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo. These two banks, along with many others, including all of the biggest ones, had joined the NZBA as it was getting organized under auspices of the UN back in 2021. NZBA, together with other related groups organized around the same time, aspired to be cartels of financial institutions that would save the planet by starving hydrocarbon fuels of all investment capital, while re-directing the money to the “green” energy transition. Now, shortly after the re-election of Donald Trump, two of the biggest banking giants had decided to exit. Could this be a sign that the zero-carbon green energy fantasy was losing its grip? In the short 19 days since that post, the trickle of resignations from the NZBA and related groups has turned into an avalanche. In the blink of an eye, what once seemed a serious threat that hydrocarbon fuels could be snuffed out by a group boycott of investors has almost entirely gone away. More on the latest developments later in this post. But first, some history of NZBA and the related alphabet soup of do-gooders. 2021 was the year that the UN’s big climate confab, known as the “Conference of Parties” or “COP,” was to be held in Glasgow, Scotland. Although the COPs are normally held every year, there had not been one in 2020 due to the Covid pandemic. After the year hiatus, COP-26 was ultimately held from October 31 to November 13, 2021. Boris Johnson, Prime Minister of the UK, who had converted from one-time climate skeptic to all-in alarmist, was determined to make this COP-26 the be-all and end-all of all COPs. The swarms of little aspiring tyrants in UN bureaucracies, just off their hugely successful Covid power grabs, were ready to flex their new muscles in the climate arena. In the many months of preparations for the Glasgow conference, the UN got the bright idea of organizing all of the world’s big financial institutions into cartels to direct their capital to an “energy transition” and away from hydrocarbon fuels. To achieve this goal, in April 2021 there was formed an entity called the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, or GFANZ. According to its website: The Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ) brings together leading financial institutions and other financial services sector participants who have individually decided to support the objectives of mobilizing capital and addressing the barriers companies face to scaling decarbonization. . . . GFANZ was founded to establish a forum for addressing and catalysing action toward the sector-wide challenges and opportunities associated with the net-zero transition. The moving force behind this initiative appears to have been a guy named Mark Carney. Have you heard of him? Here is a picture of him from the GFANZ website: Carney is a native Canadian, and a big-time guru in the central banking world: he was the Governor of the Bank of Canada from 2008 to 2013, and then promptly moved to become the Governor of the Bank of England from 2013 to 2020 (the first non-Brit to hold that position). Along the way, Carney became one of the top evangelists of the climate alarm religion. Upon leaving the Bank of England, he hopped over to the UN, where he got the highfalutin title of “Special Envoy on Climate Action and Finance.” According to its website, “GFANZ was launched in April 2021 by UN Special Envoy on Climate Action and Finance Mark Carney and the COP26 presidency to accelerate the transition to a net-zero global economy.” Carney became the Chair of GFANZ. By the time of COP-26 in November 2021, Carney had also recruited to join him as Co-Chair none other than the ultimate climate hypocrite, Mike Bloomberg (of the seven houses and eight private aircraft). According to the GFANZ website, the two remain Co-Chairs today. GFANZ was then instrumental in organizing a series of subsidiary groups divided by industry sector. Relevant to today’s post are the NZBA (formed contemporaneously with GFANZ in April 2021), and the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, NZAMI, which actually had been launched a little earlier in December 2020. Both the NZBA and the NZAMI were rapidly successful in recruiting to their membership essentially all the biggest names in their industry sectors. The missions statements of the groups are written in a bureaucratic style that makes them difficult to understand, but it is clear at least that the idea is to stop the financing of the hydrocarbon fuel industry. For example, here is the first item of the “Commitment Statement” of the NZAB: Transition the operational and attributable greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from their lending and investment portfolios to align with pathways to net-zero by 2050 or sooner.Which brings me to the latest developments: The exits from the NZAB of Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo in early December quickly opened the barn doors for the other big players to rush out. On December 31, Reuters reported that Citibank and Bank of America had just quit the NZAB. Morgan Stanley announced its exit on January 2. JP Morgan quit on January 7. These six big banks among them have a market share of more than 25% of the entire U.S. banking industry. And then, just yesterday, the largest asset manager in the country, BlackRock, quit the NZAMI. Of the three largest asset managers, another one, Vanguard, had already quit back in 2022. That leaves only State Street remaining, of the big three. Meanwhile, in case you are wondering what is going on with Mark Carney, he appears to be a leading candidate for leader of Canada’s Liberal Party now that Justin Trudeau has quit. The CBC, in a piece yesterday, says that Carney has the backing of some 30 Liberal MPs. That would mean that Carney could become the next Prime Minister of Canada, should the Liberals win the election expected to be held some time this year. On the other hand, according to the latest polls, it looks like the Liberals are headed toward one of the most decisive wipe-outs in the history of Canada. This poll, from CBC News on January 6, concludes that if the election were held that day, the Conservatives would win approximately 227 seats to the Liberals’ 44 (in a Parliament of 338). So Carney may get a chance to test how well the climate alarm message continues to sell to the Canadian voter. So far, it’s not looking good.

On the other hand, according to the latest polls, it looks like the Liberals are headed toward one of the most decisive wipe-outs in the history of Canada. This poll, from CBC News on January 6, concludes that if the election were held that day, the Conservatives would win approximately 227 seats to the Liberals’ 44 (in a Parliament of 338). So Carney may get a chance to test how well the climate alarm message continues to sell to the Canadian voter. So far, it’s not looking good.

But first, some history of NZBA and the related alphabet soup of do-gooders. 2021 was the year that the UN’s big climate confab, known as the “Conference of Parties” or “COP,” was to be held in Glasgow, Scotland. Although the COPs are normally held every year, there had not been one in 2020 due to the Covid pandemic. After the year hiatus, COP-26 was ultimately held from October 31 to November 13, 2021. Boris Johnson, Prime Minister of the UK, who had converted from one-time climate skeptic to all-in alarmist, was determined to make this COP-26 the be-all and end-all of all COPs. The swarms of little aspiring tyrants in UN bureaucracies, just off their hugely successful Covid power grabs, were ready to flex their new muscles in the climate arena. In the many months of preparations for the Glasgow conference, the UN got the bright idea of organizing all of the world’s big financial institutions into cartels to direct their capital to an “energy transition” and away from hydrocarbon fuels. To achieve this goal, in April 2021 there was formed an entity called the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, or GFANZ. According to its website: The Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ) brings together leading financial institutions and other financial services sector participants who have individually decided to support the objectives of mobilizing capital and addressing the barriers companies face to scaling decarbonization. . . . GFANZ was founded to establish a forum for addressing and catalysing action toward the sector-wide challenges and opportunities associated with the net-zero transition. The moving force behind this initiative appears to have been a guy named Mark Carney. Have you heard of him? Here is a picture of him from the GFANZ website: Carney is a native Canadian, and a big-time guru in the central banking world: he was the Governor of the Bank of Canada from 2008 to 2013, and then promptly moved to become the Governor of the Bank of England from 2013 to 2020 (the first non-Brit to hold that position). Along the way, Carney became one of the top evangelists of the climate alarm religion. Upon leaving the Bank of England, he hopped over to the UN, where he got the highfalutin title of “Special Envoy on Climate Action and Finance.” According to its website, “GFANZ was launched in April 2021 by UN Special Envoy on Climate Action and Finance Mark Carney and the COP26 presidency to accelerate the transition to a net-zero global economy.” Carney became the Chair of GFANZ. By the time of COP-26 in November 2021, Carney had also recruited to join him as Co-Chair none other than the ultimate climate hypocrite, Mike Bloomberg (of the seven houses and eight private aircraft). According to the GFANZ website, the two remain Co-Chairs today. GFANZ was then instrumental in organizing a series of subsidiary groups divided by industry sector. Relevant to today’s post are the NZBA (formed contemporaneously with GFANZ in April 2021), and the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, NZAMI, which actually had been launched a little earlier in December 2020. Both the NZBA and the NZAMI were rapidly successful in recruiting to their membership essentially all the biggest names in their industry sectors. The missions statements of the groups are written in a bureaucratic style that makes them difficult to understand, but it is clear at least that the idea is to stop the financing of the hydrocarbon fuel industry. For example, here is the first item of the “Commitment Statement” of the NZAB: Transition the operational and attributable greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from their lending and investment portfolios to align with pathways to net-zero by 2050 or sooner.Which brings me to the latest developments: The exits from the NZAB of Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo in early December quickly opened the barn doors for the other big players to rush out. On December 31, Reuters reported that Citibank and Bank of America had just quit the NZAB. Morgan Stanley announced its exit on January 2. JP Morgan quit on January 7. These six big banks among them have a market share of more than 25% of the entire U.S. banking industry. And then, just yesterday, the largest asset manager in the country, BlackRock, quit the NZAMI. Of the three largest asset managers, another one, Vanguard, had already quit back in 2022. That leaves only State Street remaining, of the big three. Meanwhile, in case you are wondering what is going on with Mark Carney, he appears to be a leading candidate for leader of Canada’s Liberal Party now that Justin Trudeau has quit. The CBC, in a piece yesterday, says that Carney has the backing of some 30 Liberal MPs. That would mean that Carney could become the next Prime Minister of Canada, should the Liberals win the election expected to be held some time this year. On the other hand, according to the latest polls, it looks like the Liberals are headed toward one of the most decisive wipe-outs in the history of Canada. This poll, from CBC News on January 6, concludes that if the election were held that day, the Conservatives would win approximately 227 seats to the Liberals’ 44 (in a Parliament of 338). So Carney may get a chance to test how well the climate alarm message continues to sell to the Canadian voter. So far, it’s not looking good.

This poll, from CBC News on January 6, concludes that if the election were held that day, the Conservatives would win approximately 227 seats to the Liberals’ 44 (in a Parliament of 338). So Carney may get a chance to test how well the climate alarm message continues to sell to the Canadian voter. So far, it’s not looking good.

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson The moving force behind this initiative appears to have been a guy named Mark Carney. Have you heard of him? Here is a picture of him from the GFANZ website: Carney is a native Canadian, and a big-time guru in the central banking world: he was the Governor of the Bank of Canada from 2008 to 2013, and then promptly moved to become the Governor of the Bank of England from 2013 to 2020 (the first non-Brit to hold that position). Along the way, Carney became one of the top evangelists of the climate alarm religion. Upon leaving the Bank of England, he hopped over to the UN, where he got the highfalutin title of “Special Envoy on Climate Action and Finance.” According to its website, “GFANZ was launched in April 2021 by UN Special Envoy on Climate Action and Finance Mark Carney and the COP26 presidency to accelerate the transition to a net-zero global economy.” Carney became the Chair of GFANZ. By the time of COP-26 in November 2021, Carney had also recruited to join him as Co-Chair none other than the ultimate climate hypocrite, Mike Bloomberg (of the seven houses and eight private aircraft). According to the GFANZ website, the two remain Co-Chairs today. GFANZ was then instrumental in organizing a series of subsidiary groups divided by industry sector. Relevant to today’s post are the NZBA (formed contemporaneously with GFANZ in April 2021), and the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, NZAMI, which actually had been launched a little earlier in December 2020. Both the NZBA and the NZAMI were rapidly successful in recruiting to their membership essentially all the biggest names in their industry sectors. The missions statements of the groups are written in a bureaucratic style that makes them difficult to understand, but it is clear at least that the idea is to stop the financing of the hydrocarbon fuel industry. For example, here is the first item of the “Commitment Statement” of the NZAB: Transition the operational and attributable greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from their lending and investment portfolios to align with pathways to net-zero by 2050 or sooner.Which brings me to the latest developments: The exits from the NZAB of Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo in early December quickly opened the barn doors for the other big players to rush out. On December 31, Reuters reported that Citibank and Bank of America had just quit the NZAB. Morgan Stanley announced its exit on January 2. JP Morgan quit on January 7. These six big banks among them have a market share of more than 25% of the entire U.S. banking industry. And then, just yesterday, the largest asset manager in the country, BlackRock, quit the NZAMI. Of the three largest asset managers, another one, Vanguard, had already quit back in 2022. That leaves only State Street remaining, of the big three. Meanwhile, in case you are wondering what is going on with Mark Carney, he appears to be a leading candidate for leader of Canada’s Liberal Party now that Justin Trudeau has quit. The CBC, in a piece yesterday, says that Carney has the backing of some 30 Liberal MPs. That would mean that Carney could become the next Prime Minister of Canada, should the Liberals win the election expected to be held some time this year. On the other hand, according to the latest polls, it looks like the Liberals are headed toward one of the most decisive wipe-outs in the history of Canada.

These six big banks among them have a market share of more than 25% of the entire U.S. banking industry. And then, just yesterday, the largest asset manager in the country, BlackRock, quit the NZAMI. Of the three largest asset managers, another one, Vanguard, had already quit back in 2022. That leaves only State Street remaining, of the big three. Meanwhile, in case you are wondering what is going on with Mark Carney, he appears to be a leading candidate for leader of Canada’s Liberal Party now that Justin Trudeau has quit. The CBC, in a piece yesterday, says that Carney has the backing of some 30 Liberal MPs. That would mean that Carney could become the next Prime Minister of Canada, should the Liberals win the election expected to be held some time this year. On the other hand, according to the latest polls, it looks like the Liberals are headed toward one of the most decisive wipe-outs in the history of Canada. This poll, from CBC News on January 6, concludes that if the election were held that day, the Conservatives would win approximately 227 seats to the Liberals’ 44 (in a Parliament of 338). So Carney may get a chance to test how well the climate alarm message continues to sell to the Canadian voter. So far, it’s not looking good.

The missions statements of the groups are written in a bureaucratic style that makes them difficult to understand, but it is clear at least that the idea is to stop the financing of the hydrocarbon fuel industry.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 11 Best Potash Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Andersons, Inc. (NASDAQ:ANDE) stands against other best potash stocks to buy according to hedge funds. Potash is a group of minerals and chemicals that contain potassium, a vital nutrient for plants and animals. The term refers to compounds including potassium sulfate, potassium-magnesium sulfate, potassium nitrate, potassium carbonate, potassium oxide, and potassium chloride. Among these, potassium chloride (KCl), also known as muriate of potash (MOP), is the most commonly produced and used form of potash. Potash is primarily used to produce fertilizers, which are essential for plant growth and development. Fertilizers containing potash help to support plant growth, increase crop yield, and enhance disease resistance. Additionally, potash helps to improve water preservation, making it an indispensable supplement to the natural nutrient content of soils. Soils often lack these essential nutrients, or growing crops have depleted them, making potash a necessary addition to maintain soil fertility. With approximately 95% of potash being used in fertilizers, its role in agriculture cannot be emphasized enough. The remaining 5% is used in the production of potassium-bearing chemicals, such as detergents, ceramics, pharmaceuticals, water conditioners, and alternatives to de-icing salt.

Potash is mined from underground deposits, either through conventional underground ore mining or by injecting water into the underground ore body and extracting the resulting brine. According to a report by the Canadian Government, potash production was estimated at 67.5 million tonnes globally in 2023, with Canada contributing 32.4% of the global supply. Canada, Russia, and Belarus dominate global potash production and accounted for 65.9% of the total in 2023. Canada is the world’s largest producer and exporter of potash, with 11 active mines in Saskatchewan, producing 21.9 million tonnes and exporting 22.8 million tonnes in 2023, which accounts for over 41% of global exports. Potash prices have fluctuated over the years, declining from 2013 to 2016 and remaining relatively low until 2020. However, in 2021, prices rose sharply due to strong demand, and the surge continued into 2022, peaking at $1,202 per tonne in April, driven by geopolitical tensions and the Russian invasion of Ukraine. By June 2023, prices had fallen to $328 per tonne as global supply concerns subsided. Potash is a vital nutrient for plants and animals, and its importance in fertilizers cannot be overstated. As the world’s population continues to grow, the demand for potash is likely to increase. A farmer driving a tractor over his field with a picturesque backdrop of the setting sun. To compile our list of the 11 best potash stocks to buy according to hedge funds, we sifted through financial media reports and potash-related ETFs to find companies that are involved in the production and processing of potash. We then used Insider Monkey’s hedge fund database to rank 11 stocks with the largest number of hedge fund holders, as of Q3 2024. The list is sorted in ascending order of hedge fund sentiment. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

The stock market has yet to gain momentum in 2025. With Donald Trump’s inauguration on January 20th drawing near, all eyes are on how investors will react this week, as it carries its own significance with key earnings reports and the much-anticipated inflation data release, which is expected to stay high. Moreover, the recent job data was better than anticipated, suggesting that the Federal Reserve may postpone its decision to cut interest rates. These reports will provide a foundation for the Trump 2.0 era, as the latest inflation and employment figures will give insights into the economic challenges and opportunities that his administration will encounter. With that context, let’s dive into what this week has in store. This week, the pace picks up in the second half with a flurry of banking earnings reports. On Wednesday, banking heavyweights like JPMorgan Chase (JPM+0.95%), BlackRock (BLK-0.84%), Citigroup (C+0.32%), and others are set to release their earnings before the opening bell. Thursday will follow with reports from M&T Bank Corporation (MTB+0.25%), Morgan Stanley (MS-0.23%), and other financial giants. Additionally, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM-3.34%) and UnitedHealth Group (UNH+4.37%) will unveil their financial performance on the same day, offering key insights into health insurance and chip sectors. This week, key inflation data will be released, providing important insights into the state of the U.S. economy. On Tuesday, the Producer Price Index (PPI) and core PPI data will be released. The PPI measures inflation at the wholesale level and provides an early indicator of potential price pressures in the broader economy. Additionally, the Federal Reserve will release its Beige Book, a detailed compilation of economic conditions from the 12 Federal Reserve Districts. This report often offers valuable clues regarding the Fed’s stance on inflation, employment trends, and broader economic growth. On Wednesday, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and core CPI data will be published, shedding light on inflationary trends and the cost of living. These reports are closely watched by economists and investors as they help gauge the effectiveness of monetary policy. On Thursday, initial jobless claims data will be released, providing a glimpse into the health of the labor market. Additionally, the Import Price Index and U.S. retail sales figures will also be published. The Import Price Index will highlight changes in the cost of goods imported into the U.S., while retail sales data will offer a look into consumer spending patterns, a key driver of economic growth.

Title: Spot Bitcoin ETFs turn 1 – Assessing what’s done and what’s next in 2025

With Bitcoin ETFs thriving, is Ethereum the next big thing in crypto investments? 11 January 2025 marked the first anniversary of U.S Spot Bitcoin [BTC] ETFs. This groundbreaking development revolutionized both the cryptocurrency landscape and traditional finance. Approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on 10 January 2024, these ETFs quickly became a dominant force, accounting for the entirety of the $44.2 billion in global crypto investment inflows by the end of 2024. Early market leaders like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale set the pace. Notably, Grayscale gained an edge due to its seamless conversion of an existing product into an ETF, debuting with a significant $29 billion in assets under management. Moreover, the debut year of Spot Bitcoin ETFs was marked by staggering trading activity. According to The Block’s Data Dashboard, cumulative volumes surpassed $38 billion in their first month alone. By the six-month mark, trading volumes had surged to approximately $323 billion, eventually exceeding an impressive $660 billion by year-end. Among these ETFs, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) stood out as a record-breaker, amassing $61 billion in assets under management (AUM) within a year. This feat outpaced its Gold ETF, which took two decades to achieve $33 billion in AUM. Remarking on the same, Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart said, “IBIT’s growth is unprecedented. It’s the fastest ETF to reach most milestones, faster than any other ETF in any asset class.” However, the dominance of IBIT extended beyond spot trading. It even made waves in the Options market, as noted by Greg Magadini, Director of Derivatives at Amberdata. With $37 billion in inflows, IBIT captured a staggering 83% of all U.S. crypto ETF inflows in 2024, solidifying its position as the market leader. However, this overwhelming success has raised concerns about the viability of smaller Bitcoin ETFs. They now face increasing pressure to differentiate themselves in a market heavily skewed toward IBIT’s popularity. Talking to a publication, Bitwise Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan noted, “Some are bigger, and some are smaller, and there are often one or two really large ETFs. But there is no market where one ETF gathers 100% of the assets, and in markets that attract tens of billions in assets, there are consistently multiple very successful ETFs.” The success of Spot Bitcoin ETFs stems from factors like Bitcoin’s price growth, sustained investor demand, April’s fourth halving, and concerns over rising U.S debt, according to Hougan. In fact, despite $149.4 million in outflows on the last trading day, analysts remain unfazed, shifting focus to a potential Bitcoin supply shock driven by surging demand for these ETFs. Meanwhile, Ethereum [ETH] ETFs are gaining traction too, closing 2024 with $35 billion in inflows despite $68.5 million in outflows on the last trading day. This resilience is a sign of growing confidence in Ethereum’s long-term potential. Ergo, analysts predict that if trends persist, 2025 could be pivotal for Ethereum ETFs, positioning them to rival Bitcoin ETFs while reshaping the crypto investment landscape.

Failing that, its job is to show that someone is in charge when crisis erupts. On 9/11, there was nothing then–Mayor Rudy Giuliani could do to keep the World Trade Center from falling. Yet he became, in that long-ago era, the most popular person in America by staying on the scene and leading at his city’s moment of greatest danger. That brings us to the fires in Los Angeles—the most devastating in the history of the city, with a reported 27,000 acres burned and the fires mostly uncontained. There, authorities have failed not only at protecting its residents but at inspiring confidence that they had the situation in hand. We start with Mayor Karen Bass.

Streets went unplowed for days, leaving the city paralyzed. Lindsay’s White House dreams ended then and there, amid heckles from his constituents.” I was a little kid, and was at my grandmother’s house in Queens. You could just feel the anger. I don’t even remember my relatives complaining about it, maybe they did, but it was in the air. People were absolutely irate. NYC had had many snowstorms before, most famously the blizzard of 1888. Think that was part of the rage, we know how to deal with snow, yet Lindsey failed at it. 14 posted on 01/11/2025 7:58:44 PM PST by jocon307 (DEMOCRATS DELENDA EST) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: jocon307 PS to my own post - to be fair, the snow melted, pretty sure no lives were lost nor homes destroyed.

Title: How To Survive “The Great Taking” in 2025

Time Published: 2025-01-12T01:26:00Z
Full Content:
EditorEconomy International Man, Nick Giambruno by Nick Giambruno International Man It’s a “scheme of central bankers to subjugate humanity by taking all securities, bank deposits, and property financed with debt.” David Webb, a former hedge fund manager, and Wall Street insider, has blown the lid off a diabolical plan more than 50 years in the making in a shocking new book. He calls it The Great Taking. I consider it an urgent must-read (available for free here). Here’s the synopsis (emphasis mine): It is about the taking of collateral (all of it), the end game of the current globally synchronous debt accumulation super cycle. This scheme is being executed by long-planned, intelligent design, the audacity and scope of which is difficult for the mind to encompass. Included are all financial assets and bank deposits, all stocks and bonds; and hence, all underlying property of all public corporations, including all inventories, plant and equipment; land, mineral deposits, inventions and intellectual property. Privately owned personal and real property financed with any amount of debt will likewise be taken, as will the assets of privately owned businesses which have been financed with debt. If even partially successful, this will be the greatest conquest and subjugation in world history. Private, closely held control of ALL central banks, and hence of all money creation, has allowed a very few people to control all political parties and governments; the intelligence agencies and their myriad front organizations; the armed forces and the police; the major corporations and, of course, the media. These very few people are the prime movers. Their plans are executed over decades. Their control is opaque. To be clear, it is these very few people, who are hidden from you, who are behind this scheme to confiscate all assets, who are waging a hybrid war against humanity. Webb shows how the dark forces behind central banking have spent the last 50 years meticulously putting the legal structures in place worldwide to sever property rights for securities. Gone are the days of physical paper share certificates and bearer securities, where you had control and ownership of the asset. Today, your control and ownership have become increasingly distant as stocks, bonds, and other investments have been centralized away from account holders and rehypothecated—a slimy practice where financial institutions reuse an account holder’s asset for their own purposes, creating multiple claims on the same asset. Contrary to what most brokerage account holders believe, they only have the appearance of ownership. If their broker goes bust, the stocks and bonds they think they own will be used to satisfy the other more senior creditors of their broker. Webb shows how, during the 2008 financial crisis, a small broker in Florida went bankrupt. Instead of sending the clients’ securities to another broker, as had traditionally been the case, they were swept up by the bankruptcy receiver. But it’s not just some isolated small broker. The bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers set the case law precedent for secured creditors to take client assets in the case of insolvency. The most senior secured creditors are the most powerful financial institutions closest to the central banks—JP Morgan, BlackRock, Goldman Sachs, etc. The net effect of The Great Taking will be the biggest centralization of money and power in history as they take everyone’s securities during a future crisis. Though it’s not just securities, they will also take ANY asset financed by debt—like real estate, cars, and small businesses—as people become unable to service their debts. Webb provides all the details and proof in his book. Here’s the bottom line. The most powerful people in the world have succeeded in subverting the property rights of securities and ensnaring most of the world with debt. The trap has been set, and the legal plumbing is in place. All that is needed is a big crisis that will cause a tidal wave of bankruptcies, and the hidden forces behind the world’s central banks will be able to take everyone’s stocks, bonds, and any property financed by debt. All the assets people think they own in brokerage accounts, bank accounts, pensions, and other financial accounts could vanish overnight. Webb says, “There will be a game of musical chairs. When the music stops, you will not have a seat. It is designed to work that way.” Webb makes a compelling case that the next financial crisis won’t be an accident; the global elite are making it happen to proceed with The Great Taking. In short, it’s not plausible that such an intelligent, deliberate plan executed with persistence for more than 50 years could happen by accident. Further, the forces behind central banking and (fake) money creation undoubtedly understand the dynamics of the boom-bust cycle they create by expanding and contracting the money supply. They know the Everything Bubble they created will lead to a massive bust. That’s when they will execute The Great Taking. Further, consumer debt is at record highs. After many years of being encouraged to go deeply into debt, many Americans have reached their maximum debt saturation. They will be ripe for the picking. As Webb explains: “Debt is not a real thing. It is an invention, a construct designed to take real things. The bottom line is that debt has for centuries had the function of dispossessing, of taking away property, capital and investments from someone.” Nobody knows the future or how The Great Taking will play out. The best you can do is to make yourself a hard target and not be among the low-hanging fruit. You can do that by being debt-free and owning unencumbered assets within your direct control. You don’t want to own something that is simultaneously someone else’s liability. That’s because the legal structures are already in place to take it from you during the next crisis. Crucially, this includes fiat currency in bank accounts. Remember, fiat currency is the unbacked liability of a bankrupt government. Further, once you deposit currency into a bank, it is no longer yours. Technically and legally, it is the bank’s property, and what you own instead is an unsecured liability of the bank. As The Great Taking unfolds, you won’t want to be on the other end of unsecured liabilities or IOUs of any kind. I believe The Great Taking could happen sooner than most realize—and it won’t be pretty for many. Most people have no idea how bad things could get—or how to prepare. That’s why I’ve published a detailed guide called The Most Dangerous Economic Crisis in 100 Years: The Top 3 Strategies You Need Right Now. Click here to download the free PDF.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best Growth Stocks to Buy and Hold in 2025. In this article, we are going to take a look at where AST SpaceMobile, Inc. (NASDAQ:ASTS) stands against the other growth stocks. The latest data from the job market in the United States came out on Friday and that has made the future of rate cuts even more uncertain. Lauren Sanfilippo, senior investment strategist at Bank of America, joined Market Domination on Yahoo Finance to discuss her market thesis and how the easing cycle is expected to play out in 2025. Sanfilippo believes that the market has been basing its decisions on the easing cycle, but the job data, which has been particularly good, has allowed investors to pivot their investment approach away from rate cuts. She added that she is not looking at more rate cuts this year and is expecting a hike amid inflation concerns. She suggested that the market must not overreact to one piece of data and wait for more data to come out before any decisions are made. Speaking of the commencement of the easing cycle, Sanfilippo believes the Fed was in the right to start the much-awaited easing cycle. However, she did share her concerns about the 100 basis point rate cut being executed over a very short time. She added that while the job market is in good shape and inflation is not that much of a problem yet, the stock market's performance may also be influenced because of yields and how stocks are "thinking about yields." She also suggested that previously stocks have been very tolerant of higher yields, and is interested to see how it changes going forward. Sanfilippo also shared her views on inflation and emphasized the importance of viewing the bigger picture more holistically. She added there is a much larger widening opportunity in the market but is waiting to see how the Q4 2024 earnings pan out. The market may be uncertain, however, some stocks in the market have a promising outlook making them a solid buy. These stocks have been pouring into solid growth opportunities and are popular among analysts and investors. That said, let's take a look at the 12 best growth stocks to buy and hold in 2025. Our Methodology We used Finviz to look for companies operating in growth sectors such as technology, financials (fintech), biotech, and communication services. We only focused on companies with a market cap of at least $2 billion and that gained more than 50% over the past 2 quarters. We then examined the analyst upside surrounding 25 stocks and picked the 12 stocks with the highest upside as of January 10, 2025. We have also included the hedge fund sentiment around each stock. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

(NASDAQ:ASTS) ranks first on our list of the best growth stocks to buy and hold in 2025. The satellite designer and manufacturer is based in Texas, United States, with plans to connect mobile phones to the cellular broadband satellite networks, allowing people to go online from anywhere they want. In 2024, the AST SpaceMobile, Inc. (NASDAQ:ASTS) launched and deployed its first five BlueBird satellites and also partnered with key companies like Google, Verizon, AT&T, and Vodafone. The company has secured these partnerships to ensure it provides 100% coverage in the United States.

The company is truly transforming the way people connect with the world through its capabilities in cellular connectivity.

Overall ASTS ranks 1st on our list of the best growth stocks to buy and hold in 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of ASTS as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Title: Woke ‘cartel’ of financial giants dealt death blow 11 days before Trump takes office: ‘A huge win’

By Owen Klinsky, Daily Caller News Foundation January 11, 2025 Asset management behemoth BlackRock wrote a letter to institutional investors Thursday announcing its exit from an emissions-focused investor group, according to the Financial Times (FT). The firm, which manages over $10 trillion and has been a leader in environmental, social and governance (ESG) investing, has left the Net Zero Asset Managers (NZAM) coalition — a United Nations–sponsored collection of financial services companies that have pledged to achieve net-zero portfolios by 2050 or sooner, the FT reported. The move comes less than two weeks before President-elect Donald Trump, who plans to embrace fossil fuels in his second term, takes office, and follows the exits of a slew of other corporations, including Goldman Sachs Group, Wells Fargo & Co., Citigroup, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase & Co. In the letter to investors, vice-chair Philipp Hildebrand wrote that the asset manager’s membership in NZAM had “caused confusion regarding BlackRock’s practices and subjected us to legal inquiries from various public officials,” according to the FT.

The world's most viewed site on global warming and climate change From THE DAILY CALLER Owen KlinskyContributor Asset management behemoth BlackRock wrote a letter to institutional investors Thursday announcing its exit from an emissions-focused investor group, according to the Financial Times (FT). The firm, which manages over $10 trillion and has been a leader in environmental, social and governance (ESG) investing, has left the Net Zero Asset Managers (NZAM) coalition — a United Nations–sponsored collection of financial services companies that have pledged to achieve net-zero portfolios by 2050 or sooner, the FT reported. The move comes less than two weeks before President-elect Donald Trump, who plans to embrace fossil fuels in his second term, takes office, and follows the exits of a slew of other corporations, including Goldman Sachs Group, Wells Fargo & Co., Citigroup, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (RELATED: UN Reportedly Moves To Unlock Tens Of Millions In Climate Funding For Country Run By Terrorists) In the letter to investors, vice-chair Philipp Hildebrand wrote that the asset manager’s membership in NZAM had “caused confusion regarding BlackRock’s practices and subjected us to legal inquiries from various public officials,” according to the FT. The firm began its ESG initiative in 2020, with CEO Larry Fink stating that “climate risk is investment risk” and that climate change would spark a “fundamental reallocation of capital.” However, the world’s largest asset manager exit has been backpedaling on its ESG efforts as of late, only supporting about 4% of the 493 environmental and social investment proposals shareholders put forward between the end of June 2023 and the end of June 2024, down from a rate of 47% in 2021. BlackRock has also walked back some of its diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) efforts, editing their DEI language to be less racially oriented. Fellow investment firm Vanguard left NZAM in 2022, while financial services firm State Street remains in the environmental coalition. “The news of BlackRock’s departure from NZAM should be music to the ears of every American consumer,” Will Hild, executive director of conservative nonprofit Consumers’ Research, told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “NZAM is an illegitimate cartel of asset managers pushing harmful and costly net zero policies across the entire economy.

Everybody is getting out before Jan 20. 47 means business, and I think he has developed a mean streak the past 4 years of outrage after outrage. In related news, NY court system just assigned a new judge to Letitia James civil fraud outrage. They see the appeals handwriting on the wall, lest it be remanded rather than dismissed. Apparently they reversed the assignment and it’s back to the original judge, Yeah but the guy who started NZAM is going to be the next idiot following Trudeau as Canadian P.M. this isn’t going to look good on his rez. Mark Carney may head the Liberals after Trudeau, but the Liberals will become irrelevant in the next election. So not looking good actually helps with the upcoming transition to Poilievre. I’m scratching my head as to how Carney can just be parachuted into the job of Canada’s Prime Minister, as all the media there are promoting. After being nominated as Trudeau’s replacement leader of the Canadian Liberal party, doesn’t Carney then have to stand for an electoral district / seat / riding to be elected by voters to be their Member of Parliament (MP), and only then can he be elevated to Liberal leader, and then Prime Minister? He doesn’t need to be elected to be the party leader but he does need to be elected to be Prime Minister since you can’t enter the house unless you are elected. If he runs and wins then some poor shmuck in a very safe seat will resign and Carney will be parachuted in. Problem is, I don’t think that the party has a very safe seat left. I hope Canadians do the decent thing and make sure this scumbag does not get elected. The sort of person you hope has a house in LA. My money is on Poilievre for Canadian PM. I’d bet an apple on it. 🙂 That looks like a good bet. By Undermedia – Own work, CC BY-SA 4.0 The shift simply indicates the direction the money is blowing. Formerly, all money went to utterly wasteful intermittent renewable energy projects. Now, that may change. Let’s hope. That’s very bold Not to say capital. They all figure the taxpayer supported subsidy spigot will get turned off with the new Administration so the opportunity for grifting the “climate crisis” gig has run its course. So sad. F’n leeches. It probably means they gave a new “scam” to milk in the works. “have” not “gave” I am beginning to dislike auto fill and word suggestions! 😩 Only beginning?? Can’t you opt out of it, John? My own sense is that between DOGE and 47, new liberal milking scams will be few and far between. The LA fire disaster is the last nail in its DEI/ESG/climate change coffin. Do you suppose the fire response will eject Gov. Gavin Newsom, D-CA from the 2028 presidential campaign? Which has likely already begun in the smoke-filled rooms of the Party’s shakers. Which smoke filled rooms? There are lots of them in CA these days. Newsom must be starting to feel the heat. Like stepping in and cleaning up the mess in LA, rebuilding the housing and being the new big landlord ? I’ll try to find out more, but for now … The bottom line is we don’t know how much money these banks were lending to the alternative energy industry in the past. And we certainly don’t know how much alternative energy lending they will do in the future. Without those data, all we have is a series of bank press releases, and our conservative wishful thinking. Press releases that a careful read reveals do NOT sound like the banks are getting out of the alternative energy lending business. Color me suspicious that this is bank virtue signaling to impress the new Trump majority. Rather than a significant change in lending policy. DETAILS: I read the article elsewhere yesterday and began wondering if these announcements were BS or a real change of lending policy. I read a few bank news releases and they sounded too woke to me. I began to think this might be far less than it seemed. Unfortunately, I had to stop my research when our old geezer friends all showed up early at our surprise birthday party, like they were coming for the 5pm early bird special at a local restaurant. As a blog editor, I always think: How do I know that is true? I want data, not just predictions, or a popular narrative. I want to see actions, not just words. My Editor Theory (Nobel Prize pending) is half of what we read is BS and the hard job is determining which half. There is a lot of lying and misleading in the news. And not all by leftists. I am suspicious of many things: (1) Banks actually getting out of the alternative energy lending business. (2) Corporations that never supported Trump donating money to his inauguration, which seem like bribes to me (3) Corporations announcing they have rejected DEI (4) Trump talking like a dictator, threatening to take over the Panama Canal, etc. … and falsely claiming Panama overcharge US ships. (5) Elon Musk acting as an America First CEO when he has HUGE financial conflicts of interest: SpaceX gets half its revenues from the US government. And the EV tax credits keep Ford and GM’s EV divisions barely alive, while Tesla EVs can survive without them. They say Missouri is the “Show Me” State. I’ve never been to Missouri, but I’m a Show Me Guy. “…all we have is a series of bank press releases, and our conservative wishful thinking.…” _________________________________________________________________________ The Climate mob will like the USSR finally collapse from its own weight, but much like Yogi Berra’s observation, “It won’t be over until its over.” Breathless posts here at WUWT claiming cracks around the edges etc. is as Richard Green says, “Wishful thinking” Mark Hertsgaard and his “Covering Climate Now” organization and others of a similar nature aren’t going to go quietly into the night. Indeed, but the fact that they are even giving it lip service is indicative of cracks in the armor. Of course the inaugural donations are bribes. They are hoping they can play nice and not be targets of wrath. The DEI/Woke mob is no longer an easy ally and the riders of convenience want off the train. Scrambling for the exit, fleeing from the anti-trust prosecutions. Too late, Larry. Besides the huge win, how about opening the files and tapes on what coercion was involved in that UN program partnership when Blackrock joined and defended its participation at the expense of fiduciary responsibilities of its clients. Very nice Owen. It makes me nervous anytime business (especially big corporation) crawl into bed with government. It is even worse that NZAM is a United Nations sponsored outfit. I have no respect for Blackrock leadership and I don’t trust them. Momentum continues to gather as financial institutions concede their job is to grow investors’ assets rather than subscribe to fashionable social and environmental movements. And when they examine the progress, or lack of it, by nations supposedly committed to reducing carbon emissions, they have all the more reasons to back away from attempts to save the planet. Canada provides them with a good example of fighting a losing battle. It committed to reducing its 2005 emissions levels by 40-45% by 2030. In actuality even with all the carbon pricing, they have fallen only 8.5%, or by only one-fifth of their goal. And guess what: the majority of citizens don’t care since they’re far more likely to be concerned with rising living costs and to elect a new government claiming to eliminate the carbon tax. So when big investment firms see this type of growing sentiment, they’re more than likely to abandon their exposure to companies that can’t deliver on their environmental promises.

Title: Bitcoin soared in 2024. How much — if any — should you own?

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Bitcoin prices soared in 2024. But you may want to tread with caution before euphoria leads you on a hasty buying spree. Bitcoin and other crypto should generally account for just a sliver of investor portfolios — generally no more than 5% — due to its extreme volatility, according to financial experts. Some investors may be wise to stay away from it altogether, they said. “You’re not going to have the same size allocation in bitcoin as you would Nasdaq or the S&P 500,” said Ivory Johnson, a certified financial planner and founder of Delancey Wealth Management, based in Washington, D.C. “Whenever you have a real volatile asset class, you need less of it in the portfolio to have the same impact” as traditional assets like stocks and bonds, said Johnson, a member of the CNBC Financial Advisor Council. Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, was the top-performing investment of 2024, by a long shot. Prices surged about 125%, ending the year around $94,000 after starting in the $40,000 range. By comparison, the S&P 500, a U.S. stock index, rose 23%. The Nasdaq, a tech-heavy stock index, grew 29%. Prices popped after Donald Trump’s U.S. presidential election win. His administration is expected to embrace deregulatory policies that would spur crypto demand. Last year, the Securities and Exchange Commission also — for the first time — approved exchange-traded funds that invest directly in bitcoin and ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency, making crypto easier for retail investors to buy. But experts cautioned that lofty profits may belie an underlying danger. “With high returns come high risk, and crypto is no exception,” Amy Arnott, a portfolio strategist for Morningstar Research Services, wrote in June. Bitcoin has been nearly five times as volatile as U.S. stocks since September 2015, and ether has been nearly 10 times as volatile, Arnott wrote. “A portfolio weighting of 5% or less seems prudent, and many investors may want to skip cryptocurrency altogether,” she said. Bitcoin lost 64% and 74% of its value in 2022 and 2018, respectively. Mathematically, investors need a 100% return to recover from a 50% loss. So far, crypto returns have been high enough to offset its additional risk — but it’s not a given that pattern will continue, Arnott said. There are a few reasons for this: Crypto has become less valuable as a portfolio diversifier as it’s gotten more mainstream, Arnott wrote. Its popularity among speculative buyers also “makes it prone to pricing bubbles that will eventually burst,” she added. BlackRock, a money manager, thinks there’s a case for owning bitcoin in a diversified portfolio, for investors who are comfortable with the “risk of potentially rapid price plunges” and who believe it will become more widely adopted, experts at the BlackRock Investment Institute wrote in early December. (BlackRock offers a bitcoin ETF, the iShares Bitcoin Trust, IBIT.) A 1% to 2% allocation to bitcoin is a “reasonable range,” BlackRock experts wrote. Going beyond would “sharply increase” bitcoin’s share of a portfolio’s total risk, they said. For example, a 2% bitcoin allocation accounts for roughly 5% of the risk of a traditional 60/40 portfolio, BlackRock estimated. But a 4% allocation swells that figure to 14% of total portfolio risk, it said. By comparison, Vanguard, another asset manager, doesn’t currently have plans to launch a crypto ETF or offer one on its brokerage platform, officials said. “In Vanguard’s view, crypto is more of a speculation than an investment,” Janel Jackson, Vanguard’s former global head of ETF Capital Markets and Broker & Index Relations, wrote in January 2024. Stock investors own shares of companies that produce goods or services, and many investors get dividends; bond investors receive regular interest payments; and commodities are real assets that meet consumption needs, Jackson wrote. “While crypto has been classified as a commodity, it’s an immature asset class that has little history, no inherent economic value, no cash flow, and can create havoc within a portfolio,” wrote Jackson, now an executive in the firm’s Financial Advisor Services unit. Ultimately, one’s total crypto allocation is a function of an investor’s appetite for and ability to take risk, according to financial advisors. “Younger, more aggressive investors might allocate more [crypto] to their portfolios,” said Douglas Boneparth, a CFP based in New York and member of CNBC’s Advisor Council. Investors generally hold about 5% of their classic 80/20 or 60/40 portfolio in crypto, said Boneparth, president and founder of Bone Fide Wealth. “I think it could be a good idea to have some exposure to bitcoin in your portfolio, but it’s not for everyone and it will remain volatile,” Boneparth said. “As far as other cryptocurrencies are concerned, it’s difficult to pinpoint which ones are poised to be a good long-term investment. That’s not to say there won’t be winners.” Investors who want to buy into crypto should consider using a dollar-cost-averaging strategy, said Johnson, of Delancey Wealth Management. “I buy 1% at a time until I get to my target risk,” Johnson said. “And that way I’m not putting 3%, 4%, 5% at one time and then something happens where it drops precipitously.” It’d also be prudent for investors interested in crypto to buy and hold it for the long term, as they would with other financial assets, Johnson said. Morningstar suggests holding cryptocurrency for at least 10 years, Arnott wrote. © 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC

Title: Jim Cramer Says Levis Strauss is ‘Intriguing’ But Ralph Lauren (RL) is Better

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Jim Cramer’s Latest Lightning Round: Top 10 Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Ralph Lauren Corporation (NYSE:RL) stands against other top stocks from Jim Cramer’s Latest Lightning Round. Jim Cramer in a recent program on CNBC recommended investors to avoid worrying when others are anxious or get too excited about something when others are also doing the same. Cramer said by the time an idea is common among investors, its price already reflects its potential. “Stocks don’t quite travel at the speed of thought but they come pretty close. So the moment a preponderance of hedge fund and mutual fund managers decide that the economy is slowing, speeding up, or flatlining, stocks start trading like that’s already the case. Usually, it takes some time to build that kind of consensus, which is why you rarely see these moves happening instantaneously. But once the big institutional portfolio managers are on the same page about something, you can be pretty darn confident that it’s baked into the averages. This is some basic economics 101 stuff.” If every piece of news is priced in, does that mean it’s meaningless to invest in stocks and you are better off putting your money in broader market funds? Cramer calls this idea “bogus” and says the market is pretty irrational at times and stocks are incorrectly priced, giving investors an opportunity. “The simple truth is that markets are not perfectly efficient. In fact, frankly, they’re often irrational. They ignore things, make mistakes, misvalue information every day. And that’s a major reason why anyone can make money picking individual stocks. These anomalies are everywhere, and they can be great for your portfolio,” Cramer added.

With each stock, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Pixabay/Public Domain Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 30 Jim Cramer was recently asked about Levi Strauss. He said the stock is “intriguing” but Ralph Lauren Corporation (NYSE:RL) is better. “People magazine says they make the best jean jackets. I didn’t know anyone else made jean jackets. I think the product is terrific. The stock itself, with a 3% yield and 13 times earnings, is intriguing, but Ralph Lauren Corp (NYSE:RL) is better—RL.” For fiscal 2025, Ralph Lauren’s revenue is expected to keep growing, though at a slower pace. RL anticipates revenue growth of 2-3% at constant currency (CC), a slight dip from the 3% growth seen in FY24. Despite ongoing weakness in its largest market, North America, which accounts for 40% of its revenue, RL is managing to grow. In Q1 FY25, North America shrank by 3.7% YoY. Reported revenue growth remained positive thanks to Europe, where revenue rose by 6.3% YoY. Overall, RL ranks 10th on our list of top stocks from Jim Cramer’s Latest Lightning Round. While we acknowledge the potential of RL, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than RL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: BlackRock quits ‘Net Zero’ initiative at perfect time as woke policies contribute to devastating LA fires

BlackRock’s timing couldn’t be better: It literally exited a weird, self-serving and futile environmental virtue signaling coalition of companies, sponsored by the unctuous bureaucrats at the United Nations no less, as Los Angeles was being burned to the ground because of woke climate policies. Corporate leaders are getting the memo, while progressives are left to sift through the ashes. Last week, The Post was first to report that BlackRock was leaving the “Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative,” a UN-backed group of institutional investors who say they want to save the world from climate Armageddon. It sounded like a good idea when BlackRock joined a few years back. The corporate ecosystem went hard left out of alleged necessity — the killing of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer was evidence that the country was systemically racist, hence the need for racial quotas in hiring through the practice of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion policies. The world was changing fast and the working and middle class needed to be indoctrinated on left-wing dogma just like they do to people in Europe, or our neighbors up north. Team-building seminars were replaced by critical race theory seminars preaching the evils of the freest place on earth. TV commercials needed to feature trans women sipping a Bud Light because American workers needed to be reminded of intersectionality 24/7. On top of this, the environment needed to be protected at all costs. Al Gore’s dystopian prediction of massive climate change that would destroy the US economy was heading for us like a runaway freight train. Scary stuff, which is why asset managers like BlackRock — the world’s biggest — but also JPMorgan and State Street joined the UN-tied group, and others like it, and began investing in a way that made sure the environment would be protected from dreaded climate change. Of course, they left out several key facts in their proselytizing. First, none of these businesses are charitable institutions; they’re publicly traded companies. If they’re going to make the world a better place, they better make money doing it. The money spigot was known as ESG, or Environmental Social Governance, investing, which uses the power of the investment dollar to tell management what to do. The misguided strategy told oil companies they needed to drill for less oil and build more windmills to get that old carbon footprint down. ESG funds carried huge fees, much higher than any found elsewhere on Wall Street. And they were seen as a gold mine by woke investors. Big state pension plans in blue states run by some of the most left-wing pols in the country were now demanding it. You could win their business if you showed sufficient fealty. BlackRock and others spread ESG dictates not just on investors who wanted it, but stealthily throughout their investment process.

Never miss a story. Big bucks to be made in going woke. Plus you had the UN to provide you with political cover. As I point out in my book, “Go Woke Go Broke; The Inside Story of the Radicalization of Corporate America,” there are real questions — serious scientific questions — whether any of these efforts to curtail carbon emissions were working and whether they were doing more harm than good. Telling oil companies to scale back on production has consequences, particularly when supply chains are stressed post-COVID. Larry Fink of BlackRock and ­Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan are billionaires. They aren’t really affected by $5 gas that began to kick in around mid-2021 when ESG was the way of the world. But working-class people felt the pain at the pump, and they had enough. The blue states lost population and their pension clout waned as people fled. Red state pension officials demanded an end to the ESG nonsense. Republicans took Congress and later, ­under the decidedly non-woke Don­ald Trump, the presidency. Jim Jordan, the powerful Ohio GOP congressman, looked into the UN-endorsed coalition, and investigated whether it violated antitrust laws involving collusion. It was one reason cited for BlackRock’s ­departure. (A spokeswoman for the coalition tells The Post the group “is not in violation of antitrust laws or any laws for that matter.”) In California, that woke mentality has become painfully clear. LA doesn’t have enough water to put out the flames. Gavin Newsom instituted strict environmental laws to save a small fish species. For all his left-wing posturing as governor, Newsom seems oblivious that climate change isn’t reversing because protecting small fish won’t stop a wildfire in a state that deals with them every year. Meanwhile, the meritocracy of the LA Fire Department is in shambles. The city’s mayor, Karen Bass, and its fire chief, Kristin Crowley, embarked on a DEI hiring spree — men need not apply for a particularly strength-intensive job. These two dunderheads aired a recruitment video that suggested it isn’t a female firefighter’s fault that she can’t physically remove someone from a burning building — it’s the victim’s fault for being there. I can’t tell you when lefty pols will end their woke insanity, but CEOs are. Fink is moving away from ESG; so is Dimon. Others like Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg are ending corporate DEI policies because not only does it deprive companies of merit, but also because people hate it — and it’s a violation of civil rights laws. If you go woke, you might not only go broke — you could also destroy an entire city.

Title: Is Visa (V) the Best Financial Stock to Buy According to Hedge Funds?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Financial Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) stands against the other best financial stocks to buy according to hedge funds. According to the Business Research Company, the market for financial services has expanded significantly in the last several years and is further expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.7% in the next few years. The year 2024 was remarkable for the financial sector, as seen by the Financial Sector Index, which rose over 30% as of mid-December and outperformed the broader market by almost 5 percentage points. This expansion came after worries over mid-sized bank failures in early 2024, which turned out to be isolated events rather than a problem affecting the entire industry. As of January 7, 2025, the market’s financial sector produced returns of 5.51% over three years, 9.68% over five years, and 9.49% over ten years. These numbers, however, pale in comparison to the sector’s remarkable success during the previous 12 months, which saw a return of 28.01%. Looking forward, according to Fidelity’s report, the financial industry’s prospects for 2025 seem promising, backed by consistent economic expansion in the United States. It is projected that the Federal Reserve’s move to rate decreases in the second half of 2024 will boost confidence and lower credit risk. Falling rates have the potential to boost lending and deposit growth while also reducing net interest margins. As per Fidelity analyst Matt Reed: “Lower rates boost economic momentum, benefiting banks and payment processors alike.” Banks that are well-diversified and have solid fundamentals are better equipped to handle a soft landing situation. Sensitive to consumer spending, payment processors are likewise poised for expansion as more accommodating monetary policy and strong consumer activity coincide. Risks still exist, though. As per the aforementioned report, if the economy weakens, some lenders may face difficulties due to their exposure to commercial real estate and possible nonperforming loans. Nonetheless, financials start 2025 with significant momentum due to a less stringent regulatory agenda following the election and more prospects for mergers and acquisitions. Michael Kantrowitz, chief investment strategist at Piper Sandler stated: “I think investors have rotated a little bit out of some of the big tech companies and into the big financial companies,” He claimed that while a lot of optimism about artificial intelligence (AI) is priced into tech businesses, some investor movement made sense since the rate environment has improved for bank earnings. Deloitte’s 2025 banking and capital markets outlook report states that banks can strengthen their basis for sustainable growth with creativity and discipline as the banking industry adjusts to a low-growth, lower-rate environment. According to the report, the baseline scenario for economic growth in 2025 is projected to fall to 1.5%, with possible deviations between 1.0% and 1.9% due to slowing consumer spending, greater unemployment, and sluggish business investment. By Q2 of 2024, consumer debt had risen to $17.7 trillion, and by March 2024, savings from the pandemic had been spent, further straining the economy. Inflation is forecast to be around 2%, allowing for three to four rate cuts, bringing the federal funds rate down to 350-375 basis points. Treasury yields are projected to fall, and following two years of inversion, the yield curve may normalize. With the exception of economies that are under pressure, global central banks will likely choose to cut benchmark rates. A close-up of a modern payments terminal with a pile of credit cards on the side. We sifted through holdings of financial ETFs and online rankings to form an initial list of 20 financial stocks. From the resultant dataset, we chose 10 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors, using Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds in Q3 2024 to gauge hedge fund sentiment for stocks. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 165 Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) is the world’s largest payment processor. It handled about $15 trillion in total volume in fiscal 2023. The firm handles transactions in more than 160 currencies and operates in more than 200 countries. Its systems can handle more than 65,000 transactions in a second. In 2024, the stock increased by about 18%, making it the best financial stock. Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) is typically connected with credit and debit cards; however, it does not issue or manage any of these accounts. To issue Visa-branded cards, it solely collaborates with banks and other financial institutions; accounts are managed by their partners. In Q4 of 2024, the company reported a 12% year-over-year growth in net revenue of $9.6 billion, with a 16% increase in earnings per share. Expectations were met as net sales expanded by 10% and EPS improved by 15% over the fiscal year. The company reported considerable growth in new flows, with revenue up 22% year on year in constant dollars, driven by a rise of 38% in Visa Direct transactions. Revenue from value-added services increased by 22% in constant dollars as well. Visa secured 650 new business partnerships while expanding and renewing important ones, such as deals with Grupo Promerica, SMCC, Alrajhi, Standard Chartered Bank, RBC, Americas Bank, and USAA. Innovations in payment solutions, including the forthcoming Flexible Credential solution and Visa A2A for account-to-account payments, highlight the company’s dedication to technical advancement. Furthermore, in fiscal 2024, there were over 2 billion tap-to-ride transactions globally, a 25% increase from the previous year, showing Visa Inc. (NYSE:V)’s dominance in contactless payments. Wells Fargo maintained its Overweight rating on Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) shares and increased its price objective from $325 to $360. The company is optimistic about consumer finance companies based on the Q4 results, stating that there are regulatory catalysts and that consumer metrics are trending stronger. In a research report, the analyst informs investors that modestly increased interest rates do not dissuade stocks or fundamentals. Wells believes with “high conviction the rally is to resume for the card issuer and network stocks.” Chris Hohn’s TCI Fund Management was the largest stakeholder in the company from among the funds in Insider Monkey’s database. It owns 16.80 million shares worth $4.62 billion as of Q3. Qualivian Investment Partners stated the following regarding Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “Visa Inc. (NYSE:V): FQ3 2024 revenues and EPS came inline versus consensus estimates with revenue and EPS growing 10% and 12% respectively. Payment volume increased by 7% and the highly profitable cross border volume increased by 14%. Operating margins at 67.1% missed consensus expectations at 67.4%. Management’s commentary on consumer spending for the back half of 2024 suggested a cautious but stable backdrop. Similar to our thoughts on MA, while we do not view V as immune to the macro backdrop, we continue to expect that over the longer term, it will continue to drive and benefit from the digitization of payments globally. Overall, V ranks first on our list of the Best Financial Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds. While we acknowledge the potential for V to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than V but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Financial Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) stands against the other best financial stocks to buy according to hedge funds. According to the Business Research Company, the market for financial services has expanded significantly in the last several years and is further expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.7% in the next few years. The year 2024 was remarkable for the financial sector, as seen by the Financial Sector Index, which rose over 30% as of mid-December and outperformed the broader market by almost 5 percentage points. This expansion came after worries over mid-sized bank failures in early 2024, which turned out to be isolated events rather than a problem affecting the entire industry. As of January 7, 2025, the market’s financial sector produced returns of 5.51% over three years, 9.68% over five years, and 9.49% over ten years. These numbers, however, pale in comparison to the sector’s remarkable success during the previous 12 months, which saw a return of 28.01%. Looking forward, according to Fidelity’s report, the financial industry’s prospects for 2025 seem promising, backed by consistent economic expansion in the United States. It is projected that the Federal Reserve’s move to rate decreases in the second half of 2024 will boost confidence and lower credit risk. Falling rates have the potential to boost lending and deposit growth while also reducing net interest margins. As per Fidelity analyst Matt Reed: “Lower rates boost economic momentum, benefiting banks and payment processors alike.” Banks that are well-diversified and have solid fundamentals are better equipped to handle a soft landing situation. Sensitive to consumer spending, payment processors are likewise poised for expansion as more accommodating monetary policy and strong consumer activity coincide. Risks still exist, though. As per the aforementioned report, if the economy weakens, some lenders may face difficulties due to their exposure to commercial real estate and possible nonperforming loans. Nonetheless, financials start 2025 with significant momentum due to a less stringent regulatory agenda following the election and more prospects for mergers and acquisitions. Michael Kantrowitz, chief investment strategist at Piper Sandler stated: “I think investors have rotated a little bit out of some of the big tech companies and into the big financial companies,” He claimed that while a lot of optimism about artificial intelligence (AI) is priced into tech businesses, some investor movement made sense since the rate environment has improved for bank earnings. Deloitte’s 2025 banking and capital markets outlook report states that banks can strengthen their basis for sustainable growth with creativity and discipline as the banking industry adjusts to a low-growth, lower-rate environment. According to the report, the baseline scenario for economic growth in 2025 is projected to fall to 1.5%, with possible deviations between 1.0% and 1.9% due to slowing consumer spending, greater unemployment, and sluggish business investment. By Q2 of 2024, consumer debt had risen to $17.7 trillion, and by March 2024, savings from the pandemic had been spent, further straining the economy. Inflation is forecast to be around 2%, allowing for three to four rate cuts, bringing the federal funds rate down to 350-375 basis points. Treasury yields are projected to fall, and following two years of inversion, the yield curve may normalize. With the exception of economies that are under pressure, global central banks will likely choose to cut benchmark rates.

We sifted through holdings of financial ETFs and online rankings to form an initial list of 20 financial stocks. From the resultant dataset, we chose 10 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors, using Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds in Q3 2024 to gauge hedge fund sentiment for stocks.

(see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 131 In 2023, Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), one of the Best Financial Stocks, processed about $9 trillion in transactions, making it the second-largest payment processor globally. The business maintains excellent operating margins, benefits from increased travel, and excels at digital and cross-border payments. The firm processes transactions in more than 150 currencies and has operations in more than 200 countries. Despite inflation and market challenges, the company has shown strong growth and profitability. Although competition and regulatory scrutiny are risks, Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) is well-positioned for future growth due to its innovative and strategic investments. Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA)’s sustainability can be seen in recent financial results. In Q3 of 2024, strong consumer spending and better global macroeconomic conditions drove a 13% YoY growth in revenue. The 10% YoY growth in gross dollar volume and the 17% YoY increase in cross-border volumes point to travel-related and overall spending still being on the rise. Revenue from value-added services increased by 18%, outpacing overall growth, while operating margins increased to 59.3%, resulting in a 16% increase in EPS. The firm continues to provide strong shareholder returns, as seen by its $12 billion authorization for a new share buyback and its $12 billion annual free cash flow. Operating cash flow increased by 58.86% YoY. James Faucette, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, increased the price objective from $564 to $654 on Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA). According to the company’s 2025 forecast statement, its attractive payments and processing market picture is predicated on a number of factors, including a demand for more M&A, quicker investment in competitive strengths, younger consumer preferences, improved investor optimism, and lessened regulatory scrutiny. Ken Griffin’s Citadel Investment Group was the largest stakeholder in the firm among the funds in Insider Monkey’s database. It owns 4.12 million shares worth $2.03 billion as of Q3. Montaka Global Investments stated the following regarding Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “Montaka owns several duopolists in the financial services industry, including Visa and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) in payments; and S&P Global in credit ratings and financial data services. These businesses have competitively protected and reliably growing core businesses. But they also have newer, high-probability adjacent opportunities. The market, however, is underappreciating this powerful combination, in our view. Overall, MA ranks 2nd on our list of the Best Financial Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds. While we acknowledge the potential for MA to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Here’s How Bitcoin Could Skyrocket by 950% in Three to Five Years, According to BitMEX Founder Arthur Hayes
URL: https://dailyhodl.com/2025/01/11/heres-how-bitcoin-could-skyrocket-by-950-in-three-to-five-years-according-to-bitmex-founder-arthur-hayes/
Time Published: 2025-01-11T20:00:11Z
Full Content:
BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes believes Bitcoin (BTC) could explode to seven figures in just a few years. In a new interview with co-founder and host of Impact Theory Tom Bilyeu, Hayes outlines his case for why Bitcoin may increase more than 950% from its current value in three to five years. He predicts governments will massively increase their money supply while long-term Bitcoin holders will continue to grow in number due to its store of value potential. “The supply of Bitcoin is fixed. We know [only] 21 million will ever be produced. However, as you have people like BlackRock, [Michael] Saylor at MicroStrategy, longtime holders like myself and others, people who are just getting into the game now, and believe in a future path of Bitcoin over the next five, 10, 15, 20, 30 years, are they going to sell? Why would you sell Bitcoin for fiat currency, if you implicitly believe that the US government and every other major government is going to increase the amount of that fiat currency ad infinitum? That’s the reason why you got into Bitcoin. So as the price rises, there are less people who want to sell it. And if we have this institutional adoption through the ETFs (exchange-traded funds) and other sort of corporate finance and vehicles, those are sticky forms of holding which takes supply out of the market, which means it’s very easy to have a very exponential rise in the marginal price of Bitcoin.” Hayes also believes retail investors will start to flood the market and allocate some portion of their retirement funds into Bitcoin to use as a hedge against inflation. “If you take a look at the entire world in terms of the largest four countries and economic blocks, they all are printing money for various different reasons. That’s only going to continue. It’s accelerating, in fact. And so we have a diminishing supply of freely traded Bitcoin with an expanding supply of fiat currency… And if we believe that more people are changing their mindset to say, ‘Okay, crypto, it survived 15 years. It’s going to be here for another 15, 20, 100 years, whatever, I feel okay thinking that this is going to be a store of value. I could use it to pay for things when I need, therefore, I’m going to take 2%, 3%, 4%, 5%, 10% of my retirement income or savings, and now start buying this asset.’ And so all these things come together, and that’s what creates a marginal price of $1 million per Bitcoin.” Bitcoin is trading for $94,403 at time of writing, up 2% in the last 24 hours.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best Cloud Computing Stocks to Buy According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Domo, Inc. (NASDAQ:DOMO) stands against the other cloud computing stocks. Cloud computing enables companies to store their infrastructures remotely using the Internet, ultimately reducing costs and creating value. As per Gartner, worldwide end-user spending on public cloud services is expected to reach $723.4 billion in 2025, reflecting a rise from $595.7 billion in 2024. The use of Al technologies in IT and business operations continues to accelerate the role of cloud computing in helping operations and outcomes. The cloud use cases have been expanding with an increased focus on distributed, hybrid, cloud-native, and multi-cloud environments, aided by a cross-cloud framework, which should make the public cloud services market achieve a growth rate of 21.5% in 2025. Gartner believes that 90% of organizations will adopt a hybrid cloud approach through 2027. Resultantly, all segments of the cloud market should see a double-digit growth rate in 2025 demonstrating how I&O (Infrastructure and Operations) leaders remain focused on effectively integrating I&O into their GenAl strategies and laying the groundwork for running Al and GenAl infrastructure at the edge. READ ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In. Moving forward, the concept of cloud computing is expected to change because of technological enhancements and dynamic business requirements. As per Nasscom Community, quantum computing integration, AI-driven cloud services and multi-cloud, and interoperability are some of the future trends in cloud computing. The emerging field of quantum computing focuses on changing how data processing is done because it can handle even the most complicated computations that some other conventional systems cannot solve. Over the next 5 years, more cloud services are expected to offer its clients quantum computing capabilities, which should in turn help in cryptography, drug development, material science, and optimization. AI and ML are some of the leading technologies behind innovation in the cloud. Nasscom Community believes that pervasive AI is expected to be in each layer of the cloud system, right from the server level to the customer service level by 2025. Moving forward, AI algorithms should help in predictive analysis and, therefore, prevent problems that can arise with infrastructure, control workload, and reduce automation of tedious tasks. Future developments in the cloud computing field are expected to enhance the multi-cloud strategies involving using more than one cloud service provider between the business and the cloud altogether. Notably, distributing workloads among several cloud providers would help enterprises maximize cost and performance. The businesses have been dividing their workload across multiple cloud service providers in a bid to control data and resources and use the strength of each cloud service provider. Our Methodology To list the 12 Best Cloud Computing Stocks to Buy According to Analysts, we conducted extensive research and sifted through several online rankings. After getting the initial list of 18 stocks, we chose the ones that were popular among hedge funds and that analysts saw the most upside to. Next, the stocks were arranged in ascending order of their average upside potential, as of 10th January. We also mentioned the hedge fund sentiment around each stock, as of Q3 2024. At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A view of the company's cloud-based business intelligence platform in use. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 15 Average Upside Potential: 39.7% Domo, Inc. (NASDAQ:DOMO)'s cloud-based platform enables businesses in integrating, visualizing, and analyzing data. The company has been pursuing several strategic initiatives to strengthen its market position and drive growth. For example, its emphasis has been on transition to a consumption-based revenue model. To be precise, this means garnering revenue on the basis of actual usage of its platform, and not via fixed subscription fees. This shift demonstrated healthy results and continues to contribute to Domo, Inc. (NASDAQ:DOMO)’s Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR). In Q3 2025, 100% of the company’s new logo deals were structured as consumption contracts, which now represent 55% of its ARR. By year-end, the company expects this to reach over 60%. The flexibility has made Domo, Inc. (NASDAQ:DOMO)’s services more accessible to a broader range of organizations. The company has been forming partnerships with cloud data warehouse providers like Snowflake and Databricks, which should help it improve lead flow and expand market reach. By integrating with well-established cloud data warehouses, Domo, Inc. (NASDAQ:DOMO) can tap into a larger customer base, potentially fueling user adoption and revenue growth. Such alliances should help boost lead flow, potentially reducing customer acquisition costs and improving sales efficiency. Domo, Inc. (NASDAQ:DOMO) has also been investing in innovation, mainly in agentic AI capabilities, to enhance product offerings and sustain its competitiveness in the ever-evolving business intelligence market. Overall DOMO ranks 2nd on our list of the best cloud computing stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of DOMO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than DOMO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

This fiscal year, Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) expects total Oracle Cloud revenue to top $25 billion. As of Q2 2025, Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL)’s remaining performance obligation (RPO) stands at ~$97 billion, reflecting growth of 50% YoY in constant currency. To give context, RPO refers to the total revenue amount the company expects to recognize in the future from contracted, not fulfilled, customer commitments. This reflects the growing trend of customers wanting larger and longer contracts, believing that Oracle Cloud Services continue to benefit their businesses. Furthermore, Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL)’s cloud RPO grew ~80% and now represents ~3/4th of the total RPO. The company expects ~39% of the total RPO to be recognized as revenue in the upcoming 12 months and it continues to expect acceleration in growth of current RPO. The company’s partnership with AWS and its open multi-cloud strategy should aid Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL)’s future growth. This approach enables the company to leverage AWS's extensive customer base while providing its own unique services and databases. The partnership is expected to potentially result in increased adoption of Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL)’s cloud services among enterprises already using AWS, further expanding Oracle's market reach. Parnassus Investments, an investment management company, released the Q3 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said: “Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) announced second-quarter results that exceeded consensus expectations, driven by growth in its cloud infrastructure business, which is benefiting from demand for AI applications. Investor sentiment was further bolstered by the company’s announcement of a new partnership with Amazon.” Overall ORCL ranks 3rd on our list of the best cloud computing stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of ORCL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than ORCL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

(NASDAQ:RXT) stands against the other cloud computing stocks. Cloud computing enables companies to store their infrastructures remotely using the Internet, ultimately reducing costs and creating value. As per Gartner, worldwide end-user spending on public cloud services is expected to reach $723.4 billion in 2025, reflecting a rise from $595.7 billion in 2024. The use of Al technologies in IT and business operations continues to accelerate the role of cloud computing in helping operations and outcomes. The cloud use cases have been expanding with an increased focus on distributed, hybrid, cloud-native, and multi-cloud environments, aided by a cross-cloud framework, which should make the public cloud services market achieve a growth rate of 21.5% in 2025. Gartner believes that 90% of organizations will adopt a hybrid cloud approach through 2027. Resultantly, all segments of the cloud market should see a double-digit growth rate in 2025 demonstrating how I&O (Infrastructure and Operations) leaders remain focused on effectively integrating I&O into their GenAl strategies and laying the groundwork for running Al and GenAl infrastructure at the edge.

Moving forward, the concept of cloud computing is expected to change because of technological enhancements and dynamic business requirements. As per Nasscom Community, quantum computing integration, AI-driven cloud services and multi-cloud, and interoperability are some of the future trends in cloud computing. The emerging field of quantum computing focuses on changing how data processing is done because it can handle even the most complicated computations that some other conventional systems cannot solve. Over the next 5 years, more cloud services are expected to offer its clients quantum computing capabilities, which should in turn help in cryptography, drug development, material science, and optimization. AI and ML are some of the leading technologies behind innovation in the cloud. Nasscom Community believes that pervasive AI is expected to be in each layer of the cloud system, right from the server level to the customer service level by 2025. Moving forward, AI algorithms should help in predictive analysis and, therefore, prevent problems that can arise with infrastructure, control workload, and reduce automation of tedious tasks. Future developments in the cloud computing field are expected to enhance the multi-cloud strategies involving using more than one cloud service provider between the business and the cloud altogether. Notably, distributing workloads among several cloud providers would help enterprises maximize cost and performance. The businesses have been dividing their workload across multiple cloud service providers in a bid to control data and resources and use the strength of each cloud service provider.

We recently published a list of 10 Companies Mirror Wall Street Downturn. In this article, we are going to take a look at where PG&E Corporation (NYSE:PCG) stands against other companies mirroring Wall Street downturn. Wall Street’s main indices finished the shortened trading week in the negative territory, dampened by labor market data that came in much hotter than expected. The news fueled concerns that the Federal Reserve will not slash interest rates again. Both the Dow Jones and the Nasdaq Composite dived by 1.63 percent on Friday, while the S&P 500 declined by 1.54 percent. Ten companies mirrored a wider market downturn amid a series of catalysts that dampened investing appetite. This article explores the reasons behind their decline. In Friday’s biggest losers, we only considered the stocks with at least $2 billion in market capitalization and $5 million in daily trading volume. Brightly-lit nighttime view of an electricity power grid with distribution lines and transmission substations. PG&E Corporation (NYSE:PCG) shares dived by 10.81 percent on Friday to finish the week at $17.17 each as investor sentiment was dampened by the ongoing wildfire in Los Angeles that has already destroyed thousands of structures and claimed the lives of 10 people. While the wildfire was not located in PG&E’s service area, analysts said investors remained cautious especially since PG&E had a history of wildfire-related liabilities, with more than $30 billion in legal claims tied to previous fires that led to its 2019 Chapter 11 bankruptcy. According to reports, the Los Angeles blaze which broke out on Tuesday already resulted in total damage and economic loss of up to $150 billion. As the fires continue to spread, weather site AccuWeather said that the economic damages could still potentially increase. PG&E Corporation (NYSE:PCG) is an energy company with businesses in renewable energy, solar, electric vehicles, natural gas vehicles, and battery storage, among others. It has service areas in various portions of California. Overall, PCG ranks 4th on our list of companies mirroring Wall Street downturn. While we acknowledge the potential of PCG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

(NASDAQ:GOOGL) is a significant player in the cloud computing space through its subsidiary, Google Cloud. The company's Al offerings are expected to differentiate its services from competitors, which should attract more enterprise customers and drive growth in this high-margin business. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) continues to aggressively integrate Al capabilities into its core offerings, which should help enhance user experiences and maintain competitive edge. In Q3 2024, Google Cloud revenues rose 35% to $11.4 billion led by accelerated growth in Google Cloud Platform across Al Infrastructure, Generative Al Solutions, and core GCP products. The synergies between Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)’s cloud services and its other Al-powered products are expected to create a strong ecosystem for businesses, which should promote deeper integration and long-term customer relationships. This can result in increased customer retention and higher-value contracts, fueling revenue growth and margin expansion in its cloud segment. Several analysts remain optimistic about Alphabet Inc.

Title: Index Funds? Nope. We’re Doing This For 8%+ Tech Dividends And Upside
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelfoster/2025/01/11/index-funds-nope-were-doing-this-for-8-tech-dividends-and-upside/
Time Published: 2025-01-11T16:49:00Z
Full Content:
We need to talk about tech stocks. Because, yes, there is a risk of a pullback here. But there’s also a way for us to minimize that risk—and grab 8%+ dividends, plus price upside, as we do so. First off, let me be clear that when I say “tech stocks,” I’m using the NASDAQ 100 as my benchmark. The index is about 60% tech, compared to about a third for the S&P 500. That higher level of tech exposure has allowed the NASDAQ to handily beat the S&P 500 over the long run That outperformance started to slow last year, with the NASDAQ only barely edging out the S&P 500. And as I write this, the NASDAQ’s P/E ratio is 37.2, higher than at any point since the dot-com bubble and well above the S&P 500’s measure of 27.9. Why the stretched valuation? The first thing that comes to mind is AI, which is already driving efficiencies outside the tech sector, such as in manufacturing, law and medicine. Meantime, the existence of open-source models, plus fierce competition between tech firms like Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta Platforms (META), OpenAI, Anthropic, Amazon.com (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT) and others, shows that AI will keep falling in cost, which could slow the continued rise of the large-cap AI stocks. This, by the way, is part of our 2025 AI-investing strategy at CEF Insider: Spread our money across high-yielding closed-end funds (CEFs) that hold big-cap AI names and also invest in companies outside tech that are poised to profit from the technology’s continued growth. Our Adams Diversified Equity Fund (ADX), for example, yields right around 9% now and not only holds firms like Microsoft, Alphabet and NVIDIA (NVDA), but also stocks like JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM), which stands to benefit as AI helps its portfolio managers make better decisions. ADX also holds Visa (V), which is using AI to improve fraud detection, lower costs and boost its margins. Another reason we could see a pullback in the NASDAQ this year is due to the resurgence of cryptocurrency driving unsustainable spending in the tech sector. We saw this in 2021, when surges in Bitcoin prices drove upward momentum on the NASDAQ. Then the bubble popped in 2022, and the NASDAQ slumped in sympathy. With Bitcoin surging again, we could be at the start of another, similar cycle. Consider, for example, the inclusion of MicroStrategy Inc. (MSTR) in the NASDAQ 100. The stock is basically a Bitcoin proxy, and while it did surge on the announcement that it would join the index, it plummeted shortly after. To be sure, one risky, unprofitable stock like MicroStrategy taking a tumble isn’t a major issue on its own (except to the people who own it, of course!). But if the stock is part of a broader index, it’s a risk to anyone investing in that index more broadly. This is a big reason why we prefer CEFs for investing in both tech and across the market—our funds’ active managers can navigate around risks like MicroStrategy, while index funds must hold the entire index at all times. Moreover, looking ahead to 2025, if the NASDAQ falls behind the S&P 500 this year, more investors are likely to look for other ways to get tech exposure, beyond a NASDAQ index fund, and actively managed CEFs, with their high dividends, are likely to have a lot of appeal. Speaking of dividends, tech-focused CEFs yield around 8% on average, as I write this. That high cash payout lets you capture profits from tech stocks more easily than you could with a NASDAQ-100 index fund like the Invesco QQQ Trust, Series 1 (QQQ)—current yield 0.5%—where a selloff could erase your “paper gains.” Below we see the market prices of two tech CEFs through 2024: the 8%-yielding BlackRock Science and Technology Trust (BST), in purple, and the 12%-paying (and private equity–focused) BlackRock Science and Technology Term Trust (BSTZ), in orange. The benchmark index fund, QQQ, is in blue BST Total Returns Ycharts Looking at this, you might feel dissatisfied that BST underperformed the NASDAQ 100—could that suggest this CEF isn’t worth buying now? Before jumping to this conclusion, remember that we’re looking at the total return–based market prices here (or the returns based on these funds’ prices on the stock market, including dividends). If we look deeper, at our two CEFs’ total return–based net asset values (NAV, or the value of their underlying portfolios, including dividends received), we see that BST more or less matched the index (while returning a big slice of its gain in cash, thanks to its high dividend), while BSTZ actually trailed a bit: Total Return on NAV Ycharts It makes sense that BSTZ is slightly behind when looking at these funds based on their portfolios, rather than their market prices, as this fund holds a large portion of private-equity assets that are still lagging as their recovery takes longer to realize. This chart also suggests BST, which sports an 8% discount to NAV (or the gap between its market price and NAV), is a great buy now. But more crucially, both BST and BSTZ have an advantage over the NASDAQ 100 that is now becoming increasingly valuable: They aren’t directly exposed to crypto. Unlike the NASDAQ 100, neither fund has a position in MSTR, and they don’t invest in other volatile crypto firms, either. So if we see 2025 turn into a repeat of 2022 for cryptocurrencies, BST and BSTZ should fare much better than the index. And even if that doesn’t happen, the risks of a NASDAQ downturn are still likely to have a much lesser impact on these well-managed funds.

Title: SNDL Inc. (SNDL): Short Seller Sentiment is Bullish

We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Liquor Stocks To Buy According to Short Sellers. In this article, we are going to take a look at where SNDL Inc. (NASDAQ:SNDL) stands against the other liquor stocks. Short selling is a strategy where traders profit from the decline in the price of a stock or other securities. It is when traders can borrow shares and sell them, hoping to purchase them back when they are cheaper. The strategy allows traders to capitalize on stocks or markets they feel are overvalued, giving them more opportunities to make a profit. READ ALSO: 7 Best CBD Stocks to Invest In Right Now Short sellers in America had a tough year in 2024, as the broader US market posted gains of over 23%, building on a gain of over 24% from 2023. The two-year uptick of 53% is the highest since the almost 66% rally in 1997 and 1998. As a result, short sellers were down $180.9 billion in last year’s mark-to-market losses, representing a decrease of approx. 15% on an average short interest of $1.2 trillion. The sectors where shorts performed the worst are, unsurprisingly, Information Technology and Communication Services, as tech stocks surged the most last year. However, the European market has recently been a popular playground for short sellers amid the region’s sluggish economic and earnings growth and political instability in France and Germany. The alcohol sector also seems like an attractive option for short selling, especially after the recent advisory by the US Surgeon General Vivek Murthy that consuming alcohol increases the risk of at least seven types of cancer, including breast, colon, and liver cancer. The report claims that alcohol consumption in the US is directly linked to approximately 100,000 cancer cases and 20,000 deaths annually. As such, Mr. Murthy has proposed to put cancer warning labels on alcoholic beverages, signaling a shift toward more aggressive tobacco-style regulation for the sector if adopted. The Surgeon General also called to reassess the guidelines on alcohol consumption limits, so consumers can weigh the risks more accurately. The advisory also managed to impact the financial market, sending down the stocks of several major alcohol players in the country, in some cases by over 3%. This comes at a time when the alcohol sector is already facing some major headwinds, including a downturn in sales following the pandemic boom, threats of looming tariffs, competition from alternative beverages, and the rapidly rising trend of abstinence. More and more Americans, especially the younger generations, are becoming increasingly conscious about health and wellness and saying ‘no’ to alcohol. According to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, America’s per capita annual consumption of alcohol in 2022 was 2.5 gallons, down from 3.28 gallons in the early 1980s. However, this shift has marked a new opportunity for the alcohol industry, which has responded by flooding the market with a wide range of low- and no-alcohol beverages. The strategy seems to be paying off, as according to Nielsen, non-alcoholic beer, wine, and spirits collectively surpassed $565 million in sales in 2023, up 35% from the year before. There are also doubts over how effective putting warning labels on alcoholic beverages will be since ingrained habits are hard to change and similar labels have done little to curb smoking. Some experts remain optimistic. Paul Gilbert, an associate professor at the University of Iowa College of Public Health, believes that it is unlikely that people will immediately change their drinking habits following the Surgeon General’s report, but it could eventually lead to changes in how people perceive their risk. To collect data for this article, we looked up the 20 Largest Publicly Traded Liquor Companies in the US and then picked out the ones with the lowest short percentage. The stocks are sorted in descending order of their short interest, as of December 13, 2024. At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into.

A close-up shot of a cannabis plant, showing its intricate details. Short % of Shares Outstanding: 1.77% Next on our list of the Best Alcohol Stocks According to Short Sellers is SNDL Inc. (NASDAQ:SNDL), the largest private-sector liquor and cannabis retailer in Canada. The company also operates as a licensed cannabis producer and stands as one of Canada’s premier vertically integrated cannabis enterprises. SNDL Inc. (NASDAQ:SNDL)’s liquor business seems to be struggling primarily due to the ‘softness seen across North America’. In Q3 of 2024, SNDL reported a net revenue of $144.6 million from its liquor segment, a decline of $7.2 million or 4.8% YoY. However, the company continues to believe in the long-term potential of the business, which still managed to deliver growth in operating income and gross margin. Like many of its peers in the cannabis business, SNDL Inc. (NASDAQ:SNDL) has been focused on sales growth instead of profits, increasing its revenue by over 1400% between 2020 and 2023. However, the company still hasn’t managed to become profitable over the last four years. It seems like the strategy is changing now as the Calgary-based company announced a restructuring plan in July to help slash its annual expenses by C$20 million ($13.9 million) and finally improve its profitability. Another positive development is that SNDL’s free cash flow was finally positive ($9.2 million) in Q3 2024, supported by ongoing operational gains in gross margin and efficient working capital management. The company is on track to deliver positive free cash flow for the 2024 calendar year, meeting or even exceeding its guidance. SNDL Inc. (NASDAQ:SNDL)’s strong financial position provides it a significant competitive edge over its competitors. The company ended Q3 2024 with a cash balance of $263 million, up from $183 million in the previous quarter, with zero outstanding debt. The company also remains committed to returning value to its shareholders and announced a share repurchase program of around $70.3 million in November. SNDL Inc. (NASDAQ:SNDL) seems to be attracting attention from institutional investors as well. In the third quarter of 2024, shares of the company were held by 10 hedge funds in the Insider Monkey database with a total stake value of $23.34 million, up 42.5% from the previous quarter. Overall SNDL ranks 6th on our list of the best alcohol stocks according to short sellers. While we acknowledge the potential for SNDL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than SNDL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Liquor Stocks To Buy According to Short Sellers. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST) stands against the other liquor stocks. Short selling is a strategy where traders profit from the decline in the price of a stock or other securities. It is when traders can borrow shares and sell them, hoping to purchase them back when they are cheaper. The strategy allows traders to capitalize on stocks or markets they feel are overvalued, giving them more opportunities to make a profit. READ ALSO: 7 Best CBD Stocks to Invest In Right Now Short sellers in America had a tough year in 2024, as the broader US market posted gains of over 23%, building on a gain of over 24% from 2023. The two-year uptick of 53% is the highest since the almost 66% rally in 1997 and 1998. As a result, short sellers were down $180.9 billion in last year’s mark-to-market losses, representing a decrease of approx. 15% on an average short interest of $1.2 trillion. The sectors where shorts performed the worst are, unsurprisingly, Information Technology and Communication Services, as tech stocks surged the most last year. However, the European market has recently been a popular playground for short sellers amid the region’s sluggish economic and earnings growth and political instability in France and Germany. The alcohol sector also seems like an attractive option for short selling, especially after the recent advisory by the US Surgeon General Vivek Murthy that consuming alcohol increases the risk of at least seven types of cancer, including breast, colon, and liver cancer. The report claims that alcohol consumption in the US is directly linked to approximately 100,000 cancer cases and 20,000 deaths annually. As such, Mr. Murthy has proposed to put cancer warning labels on alcoholic beverages, signaling a shift toward more aggressive tobacco-style regulation for the sector if adopted. The Surgeon General also called to reassess the guidelines on alcohol consumption limits, so consumers can weigh the risks more accurately. The advisory also managed to impact the financial market, sending down the stocks of several major alcohol players in the country, in some cases by over 3%. This comes at a time when the alcohol sector is already facing some major headwinds, including a downturn in sales following the pandemic boom, threats of looming tariffs, competition from alternative beverages, and the rapidly rising trend of abstinence. More and more Americans, especially the younger generations, are becoming increasingly conscious about health and wellness and saying ‘no’ to alcohol. According to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, America’s per capita annual consumption of alcohol in 2022 was 2.5 gallons, down from 3.28 gallons in the early 1980s. However, this shift has marked a new opportunity for the alcohol industry, which has responded by flooding the market with a wide range of low- and no-alcohol beverages. The strategy seems to be paying off, as according to Nielsen, non-alcoholic beer, wine, and spirits collectively surpassed $565 million in sales in 2023, up 35% from the year before. There are also doubts over how effective putting warning labels on alcoholic beverages will be since ingrained habits are hard to change and similar labels have done little to curb smoking. Some experts remain optimistic. Paul Gilbert, an associate professor at the University of Iowa College of Public Health, believes that it is unlikely that people will immediately change their drinking habits following the Surgeon General’s report, but it could eventually lead to changes in how people perceive their risk. To collect data for this article, we looked up the 20 Largest Publicly Traded Liquor Companies in the US and then picked out the ones with the lowest short percentage. The stocks are sorted in descending order of their short interest, as of December 13, 2024. At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into.

A shelf filled with a variety of bottles of energy drinks, juices, and sodas in a convenience store. Short % of Shares Outstanding: 2.24% Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST) engages in the development, marketing, sale, and distribution of energy drink beverages and concentrates. As one of the biggest names in the global energy drinks market, the company is renowned for brands like Monster Energy, Relentless, and Burn. The beverage giant also forayed into the alcohol sector in 2022 when it acquired the CANarchy Craft Brewery Collective in a deal worth $330 million. The acquisition gave Monster ownership of CANarchy’s craft breweries, which now operate under the name Monster Brewing Co. The American energy drinks market is going through an unprecedented slowdown, driven by a reduction in consumer spending and lower foot traffic in the convenience channel. However, despite these macroeconomic headwinds, Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST) has proven to be resilient. The company has managed to outperform its competitors and improve its market share in the domestic market both in volume and dollar terms, indicating that Monster's brand strength and aggressive marketing strategies are effective in maintaining its competitive edge. Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST)’s venture into the brewing sector still needs time to develop though, as net sales of its Alcohol Brands segment declined by 6% in Q3 of 2024, primarily due to the decreased sales by volume of craft beers. Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST) remains committed to expanding its footprint on a global level. The company’s international sales now account for approximately 40% of its total revenue, reducing its reliance on the challenging domestic market. The international emerging markets are especially attractive for Monster in particular. As disposable incomes in these regions rise and Western consumer trends gain popularity, the demand for energy drinks is likely to go up. The company’s strategic partnership with Coca-Cola's vast global distribution network also provides it a competitive edge in international markets. However, such aggressive international expansion carries its risks and Monster took a significant revenue hit from the ongoing hyperinflation in Argentina in Q3 2024. Overall MNST ranks 7th on our list of the best alcohol stocks according to short sellers. While we acknowledge the potential for MNST as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Title: Shareholders Urge Mark Zuckerberg to Buy Bitcoin for Meta
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/shareholders-urge-mark-zuckerberg-to-buy-bitcoin-for-meta-3808005
Time Published: 2025-01-11T15:00:26Z
Full Content:
U.Today - Mark Zuckerberg, who famously named his pet goat Bitcoin, was proposed to add Bitcoin to Meta (Facebook) holdings. According to podcaster and CEO of Jubilee Royalty Tim Kotzman, a Bitcoin Treasury Shareholder Proposal has been submitted to Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META)., marking a significant development in the adoption of Bitcoin as a corporate asset. The proposal was filed by Ethan Peck, an employee at The National Center for Public Policy Research, on behalf of his family’s shares. This initiative follows similar proposals submitted by the organization to tech giants like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). The proposal likely advocates for Meta to consider adding Bitcoin to its corporate treasury, aligning with the growing trend of institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies. If successful, this move could further solidify Bitcoin's role as a mainstream financial asset and a hedge against inflation. The shareholder proposal submitted to Meta presents a compelling argument for the company to explore adding Bitcoin to its corporate treasury. Ethan Peck, in his supporting statement, outlines the challenges of holding large cash reserves and bonds in an inflationary environment, noting that these assets are diminishing shareholder value over time. He emphasizes Bitcoin’s superior long-term performance as an inflation-resistant store of value, citing its 124% increase in 2024 and a staggering 1,265% rise over the past five years, vastly outperforming traditional bonds. Peck also highlights the alignment of Bitcoin adoption with Meta’s innovative ethos, referencing Mark Zuckerberg’s symbolic naming of his goats, "Bitcoin" and "Max," as well as Meta director Marc Andreessen’s favorable stance on cryptocurrencies. He underscores that major institutional investors, such as BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), advocate modest Bitcoin allocations, arguing that a similar strategy could benefit Meta’s shareholders. Peck draws attention to broader trends in Bitcoin adoption, including the rapid growth of BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF, corporate treasury strategies like MicroStrategy’s and potential government reserves. The proposal calls on Meta’s board to conduct an evaluation of Bitcoin as a treasury asset, positioning it as an opportunity for Meta to remain a leader in forward-thinking asset management. This approach, he argues, would honor the company’s tradition of setting technological and financial trends, rather than merely following them. This marks the company's ninth consecutive weekly Bitcoin purchase announcement, bringing its total holdings to an astounding 447,470 BTC, currently valued at $44.3 billion. MicroStrategy has ambitious plans to raise $2 billion through a preferred stock offering, potentially fueling further Bitcoin acquisitions. With a market capitalization of $93 billion, MicroStrategy now ranks as the 99th largest U.S. company, having leapt 16 spots in a single day. It also became the third most traded equity on Monday, following Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). This article was originally published on U.Today

Title: Is Agnico Eagle Mines Limited (AEM) the Best Canadian Dividend Stock to Buy For Income Investors?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Canadian Dividend Stocks to Buy For Income Investors. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Agnico Eagle Mines Limited (NYSE:AEM) stands against the other Canadian dividend stocks. Dividend stocks are favored by investors not only in the US but also internationally. Canadian dividend companies, known for their robust cash flows, steady dividends, and solid balance sheets, have been particularly popular. However, these stocks lost some appeal in recent years as investors shifted their focus to other asset classes. According to the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, there is now a renewed interest in Toronto's dividend-paying stocks, which had been overlooked for over two years. This resurgence is expected to grow as short-term interest rates in Canada continue to decline. An analyst at the bank, Ian de Verteuil, noted in a research report that the shift back to high-yielding equities, such as utilities, REITs, and communications, is just beginning. If interest rates continue to decline, the team anticipates that Canadian investors will redirect approximately $220 billion (US$161 billion) into dividend-paying stocks, moving away from fixed-income products. During periods of higher interest rates in Canada, dividend-paying equities were largely overlooked as investors sought better returns in term deposits, high-interest savings account ETFs, and technology stocks. As a result, the S&P/TSX Composite High Dividend Index has underperformed compared to the broader Canadian and US markets in both 2023 and the early part of 2024, in terms of both price appreciation and total returns. Also read: Early Retirement Portfolio: 10 Stocks to Live Off Dividends The recent underperformance of dividend stocks contrasts with their historical resilience. According to a report by Morningstar, following the 2008 financial crisis, investors gravitated toward income-focused strategies, valuing the perceived safety they offered. In 2008, funds in the Canadian Dividend and Income Equity category experienced a 24% loss, significantly less than the 33% drop in the Canadian benchmark index. Similarly, in 2011, when the TSX fell over 8%, the average fund in this category declined by only 0.8%. The report further mentioned that since 2008, dividend-focused funds have excelled at protecting investors' capital during market downturns, capturing just 65% of the downside. These funds have also performed well during market upswings, capturing 75% of the gains. From January 2008 to June 2015, this category outperformed the broader market, delivering an annualized return of 4.7% compared to 3.7% for the TSX. Concentrating on higher-yielding Canadian stocks would involve increasing exposure to sectors already heavily represented in the index, particularly financials. To achieve high yields, analysts recommend directing investments toward utilities, REITs, telecommunications, and financial sectors. Ian de Verteuil advised that Canadian investors should maintain this shift into these sectors in the future. However, he pointed out that securing high yields in Canada is challenging, as the high-yield bond market is quite restricted. Here are some other remarks from the analyst: “Canadian investors have always struggled to find yield. Unlike the US, there are very few options for ‘high’ nominal yield – there is no Canadian municipal bond market and the high-yield bond market north of the border is extremely narrow.” While Canadian dividend equities present an attractive option for investors, analysts consistently recommend diversifying across various regions to optimize returns. Due to the tendency of dividend investing to result in a heavier concentration of financial and energy stocks—common in the domestic market—income-focused investors should ensure their portfolios are well-diversified and aligned with their income objectives. That said, we will take a look at some of the best dividend Canadian stocks for income investors. Our Methodology: For this article, we scoured the list of S&P/TSX Canadian Dividend Aristocrats Index, which includes Canadian companies with at least five years of dividend growth track records. From that list, we selected stocks that are traded on American stock exchanges and sorted them by the number of hedge fund holders in our database that also had positions in those companies at the end of Q3 2024. This means that these Canadian companies are the most famous among hedge fund investors. The companies mentioned below also have strong dividend histories and healthy balance sheets, which make them reliable investment options for income investors. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of funds that have stakes in them as of Q4. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here) A macro view of a gold mine, with miners hard at work in the foreground. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 54 Agnico Eagle Mines Limited (NYSE:AEM) is a Toronto-based gold mining company that explores, develops, and produces precious metals. Gold is known for maintaining its value and is regarded as one of the most reliable investment assets worldwide. This stability is a key reason its demand and prices tend to rise during periods of market uncertainty, such as during wars or significant market downturns. The company gains considerable advantages from operating within this industry. AEM has surged significantly by nearly 62% in the past 12 months. In the third quarter of 2024, Agnico Eagle Mines Limited (NYSE:AEM)'s operational efficiency, cost management, and disciplined capital use enabled it to capitalize on record gold prices for the benefit of its shareholders. During the quarter, the firm successfully repaid $375 million in debt, bolstered its cash reserves, and maintained strong shareholder returns. The quarter also saw robust gold production, with payable gold output reaching 863,445 ounces. Production costs per ounce stood at $908, total cash costs per ounce were $921, and the all-in-sustaining costs (AISC) per ounce amounted to $1,286. Agnico Eagle Mines Limited (NYSE:AEM) also demonstrated a solid cash position, with an operating cash flow of over $1.08 billion and a free cash flow of $620 million. The company has remained committed to its shareholder obligation, paying regular dividends since 1983. It currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.40 per share and has a dividend yield of 1.90%, as of January 10. With a collective stake value of $973.4 million, 54 hedge funds held positions in Agnico Eagle Mines Limited (NYSE:AEM) in the third quarter of 2024, as per Insider Monkey's database. In the previous quarter, 54 funds held stakes in the company. Overall AEM ranks 1st on our list of the best Canadian dividend stocks for income investors. While we acknowledge the potential for AEM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

But you may want to tread with caution before euphoria leads you on a hasty buying spree. Bitcoin and other crypto should generally account for just a sliver of investor portfolios — generally no more than 5% — due to its extreme volatility, according to financial experts. Some investors may be wise to stay away from it altogether, they said. "You're not going to have the same size allocation in bitcoin as you would Nasdaq or the S&P 500," said Ivory Johnson, a certified financial planner and founder of Delancey Wealth Management, based in Washington, D.C. "Whenever you have a real volatile asset class, you need less of it in the portfolio to have the same impact" as traditional assets like stocks and bonds, said Johnson, a member of the CNBC Financial Advisor Council. Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, was the top-performing investment of 2024, by a long shot. Prices surged about 125%, ending the year around $94,000 after starting in the $40,000 range. By comparison, the S&P 500, a U.S. stock index, rose 23%. The Nasdaq, a tech-heavy stock index, grew 29%. Prices popped after Donald Trump's U.S. presidential election win. His administration is expected to embrace deregulatory policies that would spur crypto demand. Last year, the Securities and Exchange Commission also — for the first time — approved exchange-traded funds that invest directly in bitcoin and ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency, making crypto easier for retail investors to buy. But experts cautioned that lofty profits may belie an underlying danger. "With high returns come high risk, and crypto is no exception," Amy Arnott, a portfolio strategist for Morningstar Research Services, wrote in June. Bitcoin has been nearly five times as volatile as U.S. stocks since September 2015, and ether has been nearly 10 times as volatile, Arnott wrote. "A portfolio weighting of 5% or less seems prudent, and many investors may want to skip cryptocurrency altogether," she said. Bitcoin lost 64% and 74% of its value in 2022 and 2018, respectively. Mathematically, investors need a 100% return to recover from a 50% loss. So far, crypto returns have been high enough to offset its additional risk — but it's not a given that pattern will continue, Arnott said. There are a few reasons for this: Crypto has become less valuable as a portfolio diversifier as it's gotten more mainstream, Arnott wrote. Its popularity among speculative buyers also "makes it prone to pricing bubbles that will eventually burst," she added. BlackRock, a money manager, thinks there's a case for owning bitcoin in a diversified portfolio, for investors who are comfortable with the "risk of potentially rapid price plunges" and who believe it will become more widely adopted, experts at the BlackRock Investment Institute wrote in early December. (BlackRock offers a bitcoin ETF, the iShares Bitcoin Trust, IBIT.) More from Personal Finance:Why to tweak your investments after lofty stock returnsHow to make the most of crypto in 401(k) plansTarget-date funds don't work for everyone A 1% to 2% allocation to bitcoin is a "reasonable range," BlackRock experts wrote. Going beyond would "sharply increase" bitcoin's share of a portfolio's total risk, they said. For example, a 2% bitcoin allocation accounts for roughly 5% of the risk of a traditional 60/40 portfolio, BlackRock estimated. But a 4% allocation swells that figure to 14% of total portfolio risk, it said. By comparison, Vanguard, another asset manager, doesn't currently have plans to launch a crypto ETF or offer one on its brokerage platform, officials said. "In Vanguard's view, crypto is more of a speculation than an investment," Janel Jackson, Vanguard's former global head of ETF Capital Markets and Broker & Index Relations, wrote in January 2024. Stock investors own shares of companies that produce goods or services, and many investors get dividends; bond investors receive regular interest payments; and commodities are real assets that meet consumption needs, Jackson wrote. "While crypto has been classified as a commodity, it's an immature asset class that has little history, no inherent economic value, no cash flow, and can create havoc within a portfolio," wrote Jackson, now an executive in the firm's Financial Advisor Services unit. Ultimately, one's total crypto allocation is a function of an investor's appetite for and ability to take risk, according to financial advisors. "Younger, more aggressive investors might allocate more [crypto] to their portfolios," said Douglas Boneparth, a CFP based in New York and member of CNBC's Advisor Council. Investors generally hold about 5% of their classic 80/20 or 60/40 portfolio in crypto, said Boneparth, president and founder of Bone Fide Wealth. "I think it could be a good idea to have some exposure to bitcoin in your portfolio, but it's not for everyone and it will remain volatile," Boneparth said. "As far as other cryptocurrencies are concerned, it's difficult to pinpoint which ones are poised to be a good long-term investment. That's not to say there won't be winners." Investors who want to buy into crypto should consider using a dollar-cost-averaging strategy, said Johnson, of Delancey Wealth Management. "I buy 1% at a time until I get to my target risk," Johnson said. "And that way I'm not putting 3%, 4%, 5% at one time and then something happens where it drops precipitously." It'd also be prudent for investors interested in crypto to buy and hold it for the long term, as they would with other financial assets, Johnson said. Morningstar suggests holding cryptocurrency for at least 10 years, Arnott wrote. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

To achieve high yields, analysts recommend directing investments toward utilities, REITs, telecommunications, and financial sectors. Ian de Verteuil advised that Canadian investors should maintain this shift into these sectors in the future. However, he pointed out that securing high yields in Canada is challenging, as the high-yield bond market is quite restricted. Here are some other remarks from the analyst: “Canadian investors have always struggled to find yield. Unlike the US, there are very few options for ‘high’ nominal yield – there is no Canadian municipal bond market and the high-yield bond market north of the border is extremely narrow.” While Canadian dividend equities present an attractive option for investors, analysts consistently recommend diversifying across various regions to optimize returns. Due to the tendency of dividend investing to result in a heavier concentration of financial and energy stocks—common in the domestic market—income-focused investors should ensure their portfolios are well-diversified and aligned with their income objectives. That said, we will take a look at some of the best dividend Canadian stocks for income investors. Our Methodology: For this article, we scoured the list of S&P/TSX Canadian Dividend Aristocrats Index, which includes Canadian companies with at least five years of dividend growth track records. From that list, we selected stocks that are traded on American stock exchanges and sorted them by the number of hedge fund holders in our database that also had positions in those companies at the end of Q3 2024. This means that these Canadian companies are the most famous among hedge fund investors. The companies mentioned below also have strong dividend histories and healthy balance sheets, which make them reliable investment options for income investors. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of funds that have stakes in them as of Q4. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

Title: DAVID BLACKMON: ESG Is Collapsing And Net Zero Is Going With It
URL: https://dailycaller.com/2025/01/11/opinion-esg-is-collapsing-and-net-zero-is-going-with-it-david-blackmon/
Time Published: 2025-01-11T13:50:25Z
Full Content:
Just a few years ago, ESG was all the rage in the banking and investing community as globalist governments in the western world focused on a failing attempt to subsidize an energy transition into reality. The strategy was to try to strangle fossil fuel industries by denying them funding for major projects, with major ESG-focused institutional investors like BlackRock and State Street, and big banks like J.P. Morgan and Goldman Sachs leveraging their control of trillions of dollars in capital to lead the cause. But a funny thing happened on the way to a green Nirvana: It turned out that the chosen rent-seeking industries — wind, solar and electric vehicles — are not the nifty plug-and-play solutions they had been cracked up to be. Even worse, the advancement of new technologies and increased mining of cryptocurrencies created enormous new demand for electricity, resulting in heavy new demand for finding new sources of fossil fuels to keep the grid running and people moving around in reliable cars. In other words, reality butted into the green narrative, collapsing the foundations of the ESG movement. The laws of physics, thermodynamics and unanticipated consequences remain laws, not mere suggestions. Making matters worse for the ESG giants, Texas and other states passed laws disallowing any of these firms who use ESG principles to discriminate against their important oil, gas and coal industries from investing in massive state-governed funds. BlackRock and others were hit with sanctions by Texas in 2023. More recently, Texas and 10 other states sued Blackrock and other big investment houses for allegedly violating anti-trust laws. As the foundations of the ESG movement collapse, so are some of the institutions that sprang up around it. The United Nations created one such institution, the “Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative,” whose participants maintain pledges to reach net-zero emissions by 2050 and adhere to detailed plans to reach that goal. The problem with that is there is now a growing consensus that a) the forced march to a green energy transition isn’t working and worse, that it can’t work, and b) the chances of achieving the goal of net-zero by 2050 are basically net zero. There is also a rising consensus among energy companies of a pressing need to prioritize matters of energy security over nebulous emissions reduction goals that most often constitute poor deployments of capital. Even as the Biden administration has ramped up regulations and subsidies to try to force its transition, big players like ExxonMobil, Chevron, BP, and Shell have all redirected larger percentages of their capital budgets away from investments in carbon reduction projects back into their core oil-and-gas businesses. The result of this confluence of factors and events has been a recent rush by big U.S. banks and investment houses away from this UN-run alliance. In just the last two weeks, the parade away from net zero was led by major banks like Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and, most recently, JP Morgan. On Thursday, the New York Post reported that both BlackRock and State Street, a pair of investment firms who control trillions of investor dollars (BlackRock alone controls more than $10 trillion) are on the brink of joining the flood away from this increasingly toxic philosophy. In June, 2023, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink made big news when told an audience at the Aspen Ideas Festival in Aspen, Colorado that he is “ashamed of being part of this [ESG] conversation.” He almost immediately backed away from that comment, restating his dedication to what he called “conscientious capitalism.” The takeaway for most observers was that Fink might stop using the term ESG in his internal and external communications but would keep right on engaging in his discriminatory practices while using a different narrative to talk about it. But this week’s news about BlackRock and the other big firms feels different. Much has taken place in the energy space over the last 18 months, none of it positive for the energy transition or the net-zero fantasy. Perhaps all these big banks and investment funds are awakening to the reality that it will take far more than devising a new way of talking about the same old nonsense concepts to repair the damage that has already been done to the world’s energy system.

Title: World of Warcraft’s 20th anniversary was a bittersweet trip through time

We shall never see its like again. “Stand in the circles of death,” our raid leader said as our Blackrock Depths group came up on Lord Incendius, a giant fire (what else, with a name like that?) elemental. “That sounds safe,” someone responded. “Otherwise, he’ll kaboom the raid,” the raid leader finished. It was peak World of Warcraft raid chat. Reader, we stood in the circles of death, and the only person that got kaboomed was the fire lord. Our group finished him off, several “ty all” comments appeared in chat, including one from yours truly, and my Demon Hunter was back outside the Caverns of Time, ready to hit the next element of the MMORPG’s anniversary event. Blizzard went all out for World of Warcraft’s 20th birthday. The multi-month, in-game party was at a size and scale that we don’t typically see from events of its kind. Maybe Blizzard understood the gravity of the moment, the rarity of it, and figured, “Why the hell not?” How many games get to do something like this, really? Given the current state of online games still eyeing Warcraft‘s throne (and, honestly, the whole industry), the odds of another game doing something like this down the road seems … small. The king stays the king. World of Warcraft‘s anniversary has traditionally been a fun, albeit small, shindig. There are some quests to complete and special bonuses for things like experience and reputation gain, but for the most part, it’s a little celebration. This year? It felt like a party. There was a giant stage where everyone’s favorite Jim Cummings-voiced storytelling panda, Lorewalker Cho, told stories from Warcraft’s history, and you could cry and throw tomatoes. There was a fashion show where players could vote for the best outfits on display and a mount-matching competition. Leeroy Jenkins had a fried chicken stand. The vibe was immaculate. You could revisit old dungeons that had been revived for the event and fight World Bosses from past expansions that were all teleported to the same place. The original Alterac Valley came back. There were new armor sets to grab, old, previously unobtainable things came out of the vaults, and BRD went from being a dungeon to a reworked raid. There was a whole new questline focused on helping an overworked event coordinator solve problems featuring characters from across the MMO’s history that ended with everyone throwing the two of you a big party to say thank you. You could even ring the Scarab Gong (if you know, you know) and buy items that would give you reputation with factions that had been removed from the game — at last, my Zandalar Tribe reputation no longer sits there, unfinished, taunting me. I dumped tons of hours into the 20th Anniversary Celebration, admiring the obvious love and care for the history on display. World of Warcraft has changed a lot in those 20 years. I’ve been playing since near the beginning of the game’s life, and it still dumbfounds me. The class I main now, Demon Hunter, wasn’t even in the game at release. There were fewer character customization options and fewer races to play as. Stuff like Raid Finder and Dungeon Finder didn’t exist. You had to sit in Looking for Group and find other people who wanted to go to the same dungeon you did and then physically go there. Hunters used to have to carry ammo! Money was hard to earn! Mounts were luxuries! The level cap was 120 at one point! We’ve gone through, like, three different talent systems! I could spend 10,000 words covering how much WoW has changed in that time and I wouldn’t be able to do it justice. Blizzard’s 20th Anniversary Celebration wasn’t about making things the way they were but reminding us where we’d been along the way. It was like coming back to your parent’s house and seeing all your friends and finding treasure in the attic. And as I played it, something unpleasant — like tasting food you think might still be good, but as soon as it hits your tongu,e you know that bad boy has soured — wormed its way into my head: We’re probably never going to see something like this again. Okay, maybe Final Fantasy XIV gets there. Maybe Warframe. Maybe Fortnite, though Fortnite is less about itself and more about being Ready Player One. Maybe a few games make it. The good Lord willing and the creek don’t rise. But can you imagine a modern online-only game surviving long enough to get something like this? World of Warcraft is utterly unique; at one point, it had more active players than there are people who live in the state of Georgia. Imagine that. It got a South Park episode that was made partially in-game! And even that behemoth, a game so monumental, so important, that its release is literally a demarcation line for how the industry is and how games are made and released, almost didn’t survive the one-two “this game is kinda bad now” punch of Battle for Azeroth and Shadowlands that saw players leave en masse. If World of Warcraft can barely get here, what hope does anything else have? Forget the Concords and the Suicide Squads of the world; how many corpses of online-only games has the industry stepped over in the pursuit of the unattainable? How many more of those games are coming because every executive in every C-suite believes that, surely, this time will be different? In an age where servers are turned off if a game isn’t an immediate success, how could anything last 20 years, much less build a legacy? World of Warcraft was a unicorn; we shall never see something of its kind again. But it didn’t get to 12 million subscribers overnight. It was allowed to grow. Playing the 20th Anniversary Celebration was joyous, and I’m a little sad that it’s gone. The area around the Caverns of Time is once again just rock and sand. It was a triumphant celebration of a great game. But as I think of it now, all I see is what we’ve lost and what we’ll never see again. Before he worked on Warcraft Rumble, its associate game director, Adam Kugler, did not play many mobile games. Kugler was lead class designer on World of Warcraft, and at one point during Warcraft Rumble's development, he went to lunch with game director Tom Chilton to get some advice. While Kugler wanted to get guidance on where to take the MMO next, Chilton pitched working on Warcraft Rumble to Kugler and convinced him to check out some mobile games and get a better idea of the space. When he returned on Monday, Kugler had been won over by the idea of a Warcraft mobile game and jumped ship from World of Warcraft to work on a new title shortly after that. A Warcraft mobile MMO from Blizzard and NetEase is reportedly canceled after three years of development. This spinoff project, codenamed Neptune, was a mobile MMO World of Warcraft spin-off that took place during a different time period. Blizzard and NetEase scrapped it due to an unspecified financial disagreement This news comes by way of a Bloomberg report, citing people familiar with the game's development. Bloomberg reached out to NetEase and Activision Blizzard for comment on the project's status, but neither company chose to comment on the matter. Activision Blizzard plans to release a new Call of Duty game and mobile Warcraft game in 2022, according to a February 2022 financial results report. As part of that report, the company went over what investors could expect from Activision, Blizzard, and King in 2022. Notably, a Warcraft game for mobile phones is officially teased for the first time: "Blizzard is planning substantial new content for the Warcraft franchise in 2022, including new experiences in World of Warcraft and Hearthstone, and getting all-new mobile Warcraft content into players’ hands for the first time." We've yet to learn the title of this game or see it in action. It'll be the first Warcraft game released since the disappointing Warcraft 3: Reforged in 2020, and the second to hit iOS and Android, following Hearthstone. In the same report, Activision discussed Call of Duty in great detail. While the teased Call of Duty game is still untitled, this financial results report and a tweet from Infinity Ward heavily suggest that it's Modern Warfare 2. "Development on this year’s premium and Warzone experiences is being led by Activision’s renowned Infinity Ward studio," the results state. "The team is working on the most ambitious plan in franchise history, with industry-leading innovation and a broadly appealing franchise setting." Shortly afterward, Infinity Ward tweeted, "A new generation of Call of Duty is coming soon. Stay frosty." https://twitter.com/InfinityWard/status/1489346822208249861 "Stay frosty" is an iconic line of John "Soap" MacTavish, a classic Modern Warfare character that was only teased in the 2019 reboot. Considering that 2019's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare is widely regarded as the series' best game in recent memory, it's not a surprise that the Modern Warfare 2 rumors are true. A report from Bloomberg claims that this game will still release on PlayStation consoles, which makes sense as the Microsoft acquisition isn't expected to be complete until June 30, 2022. Despite the acquisition being in progress, developers fighting to unionize, and the delay of Overwatch 2 and Diablo IV, this financial results report confirms that we can still expect new games from Activision Blizzard in 2022.

Title: Cracks In the Climate Change Narrative? Blackrock Quits Net Zero Asset Management Initiative

Skip to comments. Posted on 01/11/2025 4:45:05 AM PST by MtnClimber Blackrock has become the latest financial giant to take a step back from the Net Zero Asset Managers (NZAM) Initiative and its efforts to cut so-called greenhouse gas emissions to zero by the year 2050 or sooner. Blackrock, which manages $11.5 trillion in assets, joins a growing number of firms who are walking back their support for climate and Environmental, Social and Government (ESG) commitments. According to Reuters, NZAMI has garnered more than 325 signatories that manage more than $57.5 trillion in assets, all of whom have pledged to support the goal of net zero greenhouse emissions by 2050 through various environmental initiatives. According to Reuters, a number of major Wall Street lenders have left a similar climate organization for banks in the weeks ahead of President-elect Donald Trump’s return to the White House and Republicans taking control of Congress. Trump has been openly critical of ESG investing and has voiced skepticism of Electric Vehicles (EVs) and environmental rules that are blocking the creation of new energy and infrastructure projects. Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) who chairs the House Judiciary Committee, called the move by Blackrock “a huge win for freedom and American prosperity.” Bloomberg reports that a client letter obtained from Blackrock explains that its membership in the net-zero group, “caused confusion regarding BlackRock’s practices and subjected us to legal inquiries from various public officials.” Rep. Jordan heralded the firm’s departure from NZAMI and urged other U.S. financial institutions to, “follow suit and abandon the climate cartel and woke ESG policies.” (Excerpt) Read more at amgreatness.com ...

Trump has been openly critical of ESG investing and has voiced skepticism of Electric Vehicles (EVs) and environmental rules that are blocking the creation of new energy and infrastructure projects. Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) who chairs the House Judiciary Committee, called the move by Blackrock “a huge win for freedom and American prosperity.” Bloomberg reports that a client letter obtained from Blackrock explains that its membership in the net-zero group, “caused confusion regarding BlackRock’s practices and subjected us to legal inquiries from various public officials.” Rep.

Skip to comments. Posted on 01/11/2025 4:19:52 AM PST by RoosterRedux LA is burning. And the derelict people responsible are worried that they are found out as charlatans and empty suits. The leftwing voters who enabled them are getting angry over the inferno that their chosen politicos green-lighted—as if they are shocked, shocked by the consequences of their voting. The dam buster Nero Newsom made his accustomed fiddling appearance and then split—when the media began pointing out that he prohibits new reservoirs, sends precious water out to sea, blows up dams, prevents precautionary gleaning of forests and chaparrals, and then usually blames “Climate change” or “Trump” when called to account. Poor Karen Bass was DEI-ing in Uganda after being previously warned that lack of rain, record winds, and kindling-like hillsides put her city in existential danger: Out of sight, out of mind. Or did she junket across the world to consult about fire prevention with Ghana’s new president? Was slashing nearly $18 million from the $50 billion city budget, after bragging about creating “451 new positions” in various woke/DEI fields, a way to prevent 25-square miles of Dresden-like desolation? The embattled Fire Chief Kristen Crowley for two years has bragged not of response time, not of preventive strategies to stop fires, not of slashed budgets and water shortages, but instead about her DEI credentials as the “first” (fill in the blanks) LGBTQ etc. woman, who has hired “70 percent” of her force as either nonwhite, or nonmale, or nonbinary, or non-old fashioned, tough-guy firefighters. The LA utility head? Usually AWOL. The permanent director of LA infrastructure is usually quickly fired or resigns for incompetence, bribery, or malfeasance. Joe Biden? He was there—but only to try to put thousands of acres of federal land off-limits to roadblock the evil incoming Trump administration. (Excerpt) Read more at x.com ...

The Mayor, the Governor, and many others can be indicted in criminal court and sued in civil court for gross negligence for ignoring clear risks, failing to act when action was legally or ethically required, or acting in ways that contributed to the risk of fires (like promotion of DEI over ability and moving money dedicated to fire safety like reservoirs and fire training to other frivolous programs). 5 posted on 01/11/2025 4:38:58 AM PST by RoosterRedux (Emerson paraphrased, "If you strike at the king, don't fail."

The dam buster Nero Newsom made his accustomed fiddling appearance and then split—when the media began pointing out that he prohibits new reservoirs, sends precious water out to sea, blows up dams, prevents precautionary gleaning of forests and chaparrals, and then usually blames “Climate change” or “Trump” when called to account. Poor Karen Bass was DEI-ing in Uganda after being previously warned that lack of rain, record winds, and kindling-like hillsides put her city in existential danger: Out of sight, out of mind. Or did she junket across the world to consult about fire prevention with Ghana’s new president? Was slashing nearly $18 million from the $50 billion city budget, after bragging about creating “451 new positions” in various woke/DEI fields, a way to prevent 25-square miles of Dresden-like desolation? The embattled Fire Chief Kristen Crowley for two years has bragged not of response time, not of preventive strategies to stop fires, not of slashed budgets and water shortages, but instead about her DEI credentials as the “first” (fill in the blanks) LGBTQ etc. woman, who has hired “70 percent” of her force as either nonwhite, or nonmale, or nonbinary, or non-old fashioned, tough-guy firefighters. The LA utility head? Usually AWOL. The permanent director of LA infrastructure is usually quickly fired or resigns for incompetence, bribery, or malfeasance. Joe Biden? He was there—but only to try to put thousands of acres of federal land off-limits to roadblock the evil incoming Trump administration. (Excerpt) Read more at x.com ...

Title: Meta and Amazon Axe Diversity Initiatives Ahead Of Trump’s White House Return
URL: http://deadline.com/2025/01/meta-amazon-axe-diversity-initiatives-ahead-of-donald-trump-white-house-return-1236254480/

By Caroline Frost pmc-media-editor-2024 Meta is axing its diversity programs, adding their names to a growing list of firms across corporate America making similar moves in anticipation of Donald Trump’s return to the White House. The BBC reports that Meta Platforms, the owner of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, sent a memo to staff about the decision, citing “a shifting legal and policy landscape.” Other companies to make similar recruitment decisions regarding diversity efforts since Trump won the US election in November include Walmart and McDonald. Related Stories News Gavin Newsom, In 'Meet The Press' Interview, Talks Of Organizing "Marshall Plan" To Rebuild Los Angeles After Apocalyptic Fires News "Shameful": Joe Biden Slams Meta & Mark Zuckerberg For Dropping Fact Checking In What Could Be Outgoing POTUS' Last Press Conference The BBC says the memo from Meta said that the term “DEI” (diversity, equity and inclusion) had become “charged.” It said that while it would continue to look for diverse staff, but finish seeking selection from a pool specifically of diverse candidates. Watch on Deadline Amazon previously sent a memo to staff in December, saying it was “winding down outdated programs and materials” related to representation and inclusion. Amazon confirmed to Deadline that Candi Castleberry, VP of Inclusive eXperiences and Technology, wrote to staff on December 16, saying: “We’re aiming to complete that by the end of 2024.” She added: “We believe this is important work, so we’ll keep investing in programs that help us reflect those audiences, help employees grow, thrive, and connect, and we remain dedicated to delivering inclusive experiences for customers, employees, and communities around the world.” The BBC reports that JPMorgan Chase and BlackRock this week pulled out of groups focused on risks from climate change. It follows Meta’s announcement four days ago that it was ending a fact-checking program previously criticised by Trump and Republicans. Deadline reported Tuesday that Zuckerberg had posted a video saying: “The recent elections also feel like a cultural tipping point towards, once again, prioritizing speech. So we’re going back to our roots and focus on reducing mistakes, simplifying our policies and restoring free expression on our platforms.” The changes are just the latest effort by Meta given that Trump and his allies have targeted the platform and Zuckerberg himself. Following Trump’s reelection, Zuckerberg met with the president-elect. Last week, Meta’s chief global affairs officer, Nick Clegg, announced his departure, to be replaced by Joel Kaplan, a Republican who has been sympathetic to claims that the platform has suppressed conservative voices.

Key takeaways The crypto market is going mainstream, and several leading institutions, including BlackRock and Standard Chartered, are expanding their base in the nascent industry. As these institutions take positions in larger cryptos like Bitcoin and Ether, retail investors can invest in newer projects with massive potential. One project that could record massive growth in 2025 is iDEGEN. The project merges the AI and memecoin ecosystems, ensuring investors take advantage of both. According to their whitepaper, iDEGEN is a meme project that leverages the benefits of AI in a bid to create the next billion-dollar memecoin. iDEGEN is a tool designed to learn, evolve, and adapt by leveraging community feeds on X. While iDEGEN is powered by AI, degens ultimately raise the tool. The team is launching the token as a memecoin thanks to the massive adoption of this narrative in recent years. In 2024, the memecoin space grew from a $20 billion market cap to $120 billion, representing a 500% growth within 12 months. It is the second-best performing narrative in the crypto space, only behind AI. Hence, iDEGEN combining AI and memecoin means it seeks to leverage the two fastest-growing narratives in the crypto space. As a memecoin, iDEGEN could be on track to outperform several other cryptocurrencies in the broader market. The team explained that the iDEGEN tool has a simple working mechanism. Users feed the tool their data through tweets, tags, and comments. It absorbs the post and adds it to its knowledge base; that’s how it learns. Furthermore, the tool posts on X every 60 minutes and can generate and post memes. Want to read more about iDEGEN? Click here. The iDEGEN pre-market auction continues to hit new milestones. According to the website, the pre-market auction has raised $16 million, selling over 1.3 billion $IDGN tokens. Furthermore, $iDGN has 18,375 holders, accumulating 65,176% in ROI since investing in this token. iDEGEN implemented a unique pre-market auction method that allows early investors to record excellent gains. Despite the broader crypto market’s underperformance, the iDEGEN token has increased 939% in the last seven days. With the pre-market auction method, the price adjusts every five minutes based on market activity. According to the team, if an investor purchases $IDGN tokens within five minutes, the price will remain steady for the next period. However, if purchases occur consecutively, the price will rise by 5%. Finally, if no one buys the tokens within five minutes, the price will drop by 5%. The iDEGEN pre-market auction has raised over $16 million to enable the team to build its products and services. With over 900% ROI for early investors in the last seven days, this token could outperform thousands of cryptocurrencies once it lists on exchanges. As an investor, one of the best times to buy a token is during its presale. With $IDGN still up for grabs, this could be an excellent investment in the medium to long term. $IDGN will list once the pre-market auction is over and could deliver excellent gains to early investors thanks to its AI and memecoin combination. Investors can easily track key information on the iDEGEN website, including the token’s pre-market listing price. This enables them to track the token’s progress accurately before its launch on trading platforms.

Title: Dundrum apartments decision a symptom of broken planning system
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/2025/01/11/dundrum-apartments-decision-a-symptom-of-broken-planning-system/
Time Published: 2025-01-11T07:15:00Z
Full Content:
News that An Bord Pleanála had turned down a proposed development of 881 apartments on the site of the old Dundrum shopping centre follows an all-too-familiar pattern. A lengthy and complicated process has a project shot down due to objections and the decision of planners that rules had been contravened. Initial plans to redevelop this site go back as far as 2004, with the latest decision relating to an application process that started towards the end of 2021. I am not qualified to give an opinion on the reasons the scheme was turned down, which ranged from height to the nature and scale of the residential plans, to flood planning and transport concerns and a view that it did not fit within planning guidelines. Reading the decision gives an insight into the complexity of factors involved. But what is clear when we stand back is that this is another example of the planning and development system not acting in the wider national interest. There is, after all, a housing crisis. Here is a site that is ideally suited to development. It is in an urban area where, on the basis of all the national and local plans, development is desirable. National guidelines underline the vital goal of more “compact” living – developing sites near city and town centres and transport links, necessary to achieve climate goals. This site is 50m from a Luas stop, beside a host of bus services and near schools, shops and other services. The Strategic Housing Development scheme introduced in 2017, designed to speed things up by allowing developers to bypass local authorities (and under which the Dundrum application was made) has been a disaster Yet somehow the developers and planners cannot come up with a scheme to get it done. In a logical scenario, the two sides would sit down at the start – based on clear planning guidelines – drawn up after local consultation and offering appropriate rights to objection and agree what could happen. Once the developer stayed within the rules, it would happen. Instead, the Irish system looks back to front and upside down. Developers face delay and uncertainty. Planners are trying to guard against their decisions being legally overturned. The courts rule on narrow matters of law and this is not always in line with the wider interest. The odds are stacked against progress being made, particularly in the case of complex infill sites such as Dundrum. Reading Dundrum, it is clear that the local and national guidelines are not always completely aligned, or at least leave room for significant interpretation. There was a pre-planning meeting between the developers and the planners in late 2021 designed to scope things out. But, in the light of this, reading the planning judgment leaves you mystified about the gap between, on one side, a developer who felt their scheme was fully justified and, on the other, a planning authority who felt the exact opposite. Difficulties in developing urban sites are common, though reasons vary. Just down the road, the site of the old Central Mental Hospital has also been through the planning hoops, held up by an objection from another developer to a scheme approved by An Bord Pleanála. A joint venture between the local authority and the Land Development Agency may finally get the vital provision of more than 800 social and affordable houses started. But with years of delay. Two build-to-rent schemes in Blackrock and Dublin 18 proposed by Cairn Homes were turned down by An Bord Pleanála after lengthy consideration – one due to an “over-proliferation” of such schemes in the area. Cross the river to the north side of Dublin and you find the Supreme Court ruling against the planning approval for more than 1,500 apartments on the old Clonliffe College site, because enough consideration had not been given to potential damage to the adjoining lands and structures. Developments for renters, in other words, are not welcome. Local homeowners and businesses often have legitimate concerns, but the better-off use any legal tool to maintain the status quo And a scheme to redevelop an old pitch and putt course beside the Cadbury factory on the Malahide Road was turned down by An Bord Pleanála because it ruled that an assisted living element to the site did not go far enough to meet “mixed-use” guidelines (meaning that sites should comprise more than just housing), concerns about light in a minority of the apartments and a finding that the developers had failed to adequately consider the impact on Brent geese. A survey had shown no evidence that the geese – a regular feature of appeals in north Dublin – had used the site at all in recent years. This is not an argument to allow proper planning and vital environmental rules to be ignored. But if compact living is the goal of national policy, then Ireland needs to get a lot better at this. The Strategic Housing Development scheme introduced in 2017, designed to speed things up by allowing developers to bypass local authorities (and under which the Dundrum application was made) has been a disaster, spurring a host of legal challenges. At least its replacement seems better. Meanwhile, in some aspects – such as the designation of new urban development zones – the new planning act may help, though its implementation is going to take time and planning experts warn about the impact of some provisions. The Sinn Féin housing plan, meanwhile, had sensible suggestions about just how developers and local authorities could co-operate more effectively to get redevelopments on “brownfield” sites such as the one in Dundrum planned and delivered more effectively. And the Commission on Housing has a good analysis of the particular planning and financial challenges in redeveloping these sites and how to address them. At the moment nobody’s interests are served – except the lawyers and planning consultants, of course. Or maybe, quietly, it all suits some people quite well. A number of the objections to rental housing schemes refer pejoratively to the creation of a “transient” community or one that is not “stable”. Developments for renters, in other words, are not welcome. Local homeowners and businesses often have legitimate concerns, but the better-off use any legal tool to maintain the status quo. And local politicians quoted in the case of Dundrum, for example, were happy to support the idea of development, but also to repeat the objections of constituents to this scheme. A malign mind might argue that rather than this all being seen as a problem that goes to the heart of national spatial, social, economic and climate policy, a lot of people are happy enough with the way things are. And to see lack of supply keep the value of their house on the up. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Full Content:
Margarita Olegovna Louis-Dreyfus. This is the first name that stands out in the shareholder structure of the company Leonidsport, which submitted a public offer for 21% of the shares of the Thessaloniki Port Authority (OLT). She is the widow of Robert Louis-Dreyfus and head of the French giant Louis-Dreyfus, one of the most powerful conglomerates on the planet. “Tsarina,” is the nickname used for her by the French and American press due to her Russian origins, even though she does not come from a noble family or ultra-wealthy oligarchs from Russia, as one might imagine. The fourth wealthiest woman in Europe and one of the wealthiest in the world today, with a fortune exceeding 5 billion euros, the woman who controls global agricultural product trade and has powerful businesses in every sector of the economy one can think of, was once a poor orphan from the Soviet Union, educated thanks to the sacrifices of her grandfather. From Leningrad to the top of the world Her grandfather, Leonid Bogdanov, also raised her after her parents were killed in a train accident in 1969, when Margarita was just 7 years old. Bogdanov believed that the greatest wealth he could give Margarita was education and did everything he could to provide it. After graduating from school, she left Leningrad (now St. Petersburg) and studied law at Moscow State University. Immediately after, she pursued a master’s degree at the Institute of Soviet Trade in Leningrad, where she obtained degrees in economics. After completing her studies, Margarita left the Soviet Union, where opportunities were limited. Armed with her high educational level, sharp mind, and impressive appearance, she secured a job as a salesperson at the German microchip and electronics company Laytron AG. Her grandfather, Leonid, whose name was given— as one can easily guess— to the company that is “entering” OLT, lived to see his beloved granddaughter “settled,” with a good job and prospects. Not family-wise, though, since in the mid-1980s Margarita married a Swiss student, with whom she divorced a year later. However, he did not live to see her become a powerful woman, as he passed away in 1985. In 1988, Margarita was on a flight from Zurich to London. Fate had her sitting next to Robert Louis-Dreyfus, the French businessman with an MBA from Harvard, who was constantly “in the air” because he managed the companies of the commercial giant founded by his great-grandfather in 1851. Margarita didn’t know this when she asked him what time it was. Nor did she know when they “clicked,” because, aside from telling her the time, he showed her a picture of his fluffy British shepherd dog (Bobtail) to attract the attention of the striking blonde sitting next to him. Something he succeeded at, as well as getting her phone number. A few days later, Robert called Margarita, asking her to translate a document into Russian. “You know, you could have asked me to go out to dinner without needing any translation,” she responded. “Alright,” he murmured, and their love story inevitably led to their marriage in 1992. After the marriage, Margarita acquired Swiss citizenship and became a full-time mother, caring for the three children she had with Robert: Eric and the twin boys, Kiril and Maurice. Meanwhile, Robert Louis-Dreyfus had created a new business empire without using a single cent from the conglomerate he was about to inherit—he was not involved in it anyway. He had made a fortune from poker (!) and was about to build an even greater fortune by rescuing failing businesses like the sports giant Adidas and the advertising firm Saatchi & Saatchi. Among the dozens of companies he managed in Europe, Australia, Asia, and the Americas, he became more and more involved in sports. In 1996, he made headlines by purchasing the historic French football club Marseille (Olympique de Marseille). His joy at becoming involved in European professional football would not last long. A year later, he was diagnosed with leukemia. The disease was very aggressive, and as his battle became more intense, he gradually entrusted Margarita with more and more responsibilities. In 2000, he returned to the family agricultural giant, the Louis-Dreyfus Group, which his great-grandfather had founded in 1851. In 2008, he founded Akira Holding to transfer 61% of Louis-Dreyfus, which he would gather, to her. Robert sensed that his end was near and anticipated what could happen to other giants: The board might “throw out” his wife to take control and transfer the company to another conglomerate. Thus, in 2008, he locked the shares for 99 years and appointed Margarita as the family trustee, ensuring that the aforementioned scenario could not happen. When he died in July 2009, at the age of 63, he left her in the strongest position on the three-member board, overseeing the largest share of the company, headquartered in Amsterdam, the third-largest agricultural products company in the world. But Margarita, after her husband’s death, did everything she could to fulfill his last wish, as he expressed it to her shortly before he passed away. “Do what I did. Maintain and grow the company to pass it on to our heirs,” their children. The new life It wasn’t an easy task. Yes, Robert had “locked” the shares so that no other shareholders or members could remove her from the board, but Margarita had to fight to earn respect, not just in the business world but even in the companies she controlled. “It’s a man’s world, and most of the time, men don’t take women seriously,” she said in an interview with Bloomberg, speaking about her business career. Margarita didn’t settle for the (more than comfortable) life of being the widow and heir of one of the wealthiest people in the world. She took action as president of Louis-Dreyfus companies and also Marseille, where she recently managed to fend off an aggressive takeover attempt by Saudi Prince Al-Waleed. And she made remarkable changes in the group. She sold the energy trading company and acquired more shares in Louis-Dreyfus, strengthening her position in it. At the same time, she was “building” the future for her three sons. She sent the twins to a school in Singapore “to expose them to new cultures and broaden their horizons,” as she said in an interview, while Eric studied in the USA and began his career as an intern at another commodity giant, Glencore, to gain the necessary experience. Margarita never stayed in the shadows. She earned the prestige and respect of the most powerful business circles on the planet and… inevitably began mingling with Europe’s elite. In the stands of the Stade Vélodrome (the home of Olympique Marseille), she was often photographed with French Presidents, such as Nicolas Sarkozy and the now-powerful head of the ECB, Christine Lagarde. From 2013 onward, in these photos, she would often appear with the former head of the Swiss National Bank and later vice-president of BlackRock, Philippe Hildebrandt. Their joint appearances would become the subject of discussion since, that year, Hildebrandt would divorce his wife, Kasia, after becoming involved in a trading scandal. This scandal also cost Hildebrandt his job, as Kasia is said to have made a significant profit with insider information about Switzerland’s monetary policy. Although there isn’t much information about Margarita Louis-Dreyfus’ personal life, in 2021, Louis Dreyfus Group confirmed journalistic reports that Margarita gave birth to twin girls, with the statement “the mother and babies are in excellent health,” without any mention of the father. How big is the Louis-Dreyfus Group? But how big and powerful can Louis Dreyfus be, for Margarita to be called “Tsarina”? If annual sales of 120 billion (net revenue of around 50-60 billion dollars yearly), operations in 100 countries, and 22,000 employees don’t say much to you, then perhaps the “ABCD” can. The four companies that dominate global agricultural product trade and primarily grains—Archer Daniels Midland, Bunge, Cargill, and Louis Dreyfus—are known as “ABCD.” These four companies were also involved in the 2011 scandal about grain price manipulation and tax evasion in Argentina. The French company represents about 10% of global agricultural trade flows, is the world’s largest cotton and rice trader, and the second-largest sugar trader. It is also the third-largest trader of copper, zinc, and lead concentrates globally, only behind Glencore and Trafigura. Louis Dreyfus is not just involved in agriculture and food processing. It also operates in international shipping with a fleet of oceangoing vessels, freight transportation, banking (owning the French bank Louis Dreyfus and shares in other banks), telecommunications infrastructure development, real estate management, and trades everything from minerals to Brazilian coffee, also owning several hedge funds. LD was founded in 1851 by Leopold Dreyfus, an 18-year-old Alsatian Jew, who became wealthy from his adolescence by buying and reselling grain from farmers to more distant regions. Leopold Dreyfus thus created one of Europe’s strongest dynasties. To this day, the company he founded is owned and managed by descendants of the same family. OLT and the Shareholders Margarita Louis-Dreyfus is now poised to take a leading role in Greek business life after submitting an optional public offer to acquire up to 2,116,800 shares of OLT, representing 21% of the company’s capital, through the company “Leonidsport B.V.” The company, which bears the name of Margarita’s grandfather, began the process yesterday, informing the Capital Markets Commission and OLT’s Board of Directors, submitting the information prospectus to them. The offered cash price for acquiring each share in the Public Offer is 27 euros. It should be noted that OLT’s stock closed at 22.88 euros yesterday, which is a premium of more than 17% compared to the price of the company’s shares. Explore related questions
