Friday, March 7th, 2025 Canadian tariff drama, fears of OPEC+ production returning to markets, Trump’s maximum pressure on Iran, and a US-China trade war – this week seemed to have it all. Oil prices tumbled through the week but then started to recover early on Friday morning. With flattening backwardation prompting the Saudis to cut prices, the initial shock of Trump’s first month is giving way to a more nuanced approach with ICE Brent futures trading around the $71 per barrel mark. Trump Delays Mexico Tariffs for A Month. In contrast to worsening US-Canada relations, the White House has postponed tariffs on most imports from Mexico until 2 April following President Trump’s call with his Mexican peer Claudia Sheinbaum, allowing US refiners to continue their heavy crude imports. Iraq’s Kurdish Dream Has Failed Again. Baghdad’s political push to restart pipeline flows from Kurdish-controlled regions to Turkey’s port of Ceyhan has run aground again, after Iraq’s $16 per barrel price offered to oil companies currently drilling in Kurdistan failed to entice sufficient interest. BlackRock Buys the Panama Canal. US investment giant BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) agreed to buy two major ports on the Panama Canal and ancillary infrastructure from Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison for $22.8 billion, in line with President Trump’s demands that Panama cut Chinese influence at the canal. Chinese Oil Imports Slump as Sanctions Affect Buying. Chinese crude oil imports averaged 10.38 million b/d in January-February 2025, marking a 5% year-over-year decrease, as recent US sanctions on Iranian and Russian tankers disrupted deliveries to the northeastern Shandong province. Venture Global Doubles Down on Plaquemines. US LNG developer Venture Global (NYSE:VG) said it would expand the aggregate production capacity of its 27 mtpa Plaquemines LNG plant in Louisiana to 45 mtpa, eyeing additional 24 trains in the project’s third expansion phase at a cost of 18 billion. Saudi Arabia Drops April Oil Prices. Saudi Aramco (TADAWUL:2222), the world’s largest oil exporter, cut its formula prices for April-loading cargoes into Asia with Arab Light now priced at $3.50 per barrel above Dubai, the first downward move in three months as the market anticipates the unwinding of OPEC+ cuts. US Withdraws from Coal Divestment Alliance. As announced by US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, the United States will withdraw from the International Partners Group, a global coal divestment initiative, leaving South Africa with a more than $1 billion financing gap to decommission coal plants. Copper Soars to 4-Month High. Copper prices gained this week after US President Trump waived carmakers from tariffs and China’s National Congress doubled down on stimulus measures, sending the LME three-month contract to its highest since early November 2024, above $9,700 per metric tonne. Ireland Eyes First LNG Terminal. The government of Ireland has approved a plan to develop an emergency LNG import facility, to be used as a floating strategic gas reserve, less than two years after Dublin rejected an application to build an LNG terminal on climate grounds. Trump Administration Flags $20 Billion SPR Spree. Whilst touring the Plaquemines LNG facility in Louisiana, US Secretary of Energy Chris Wright stated that he plans to seek up to $20 billion in congressional funding to refill the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve, equivalent to 295 million barrels. Defying Trump Fears, Canada Wants More US Pipes. Canada’s midstream giant Enbridge (NYSE:ENB) has allocated $1.4 billion to boost the throughput capacity of its main US-bound oil conduit Mainline by an additional 300,000 b/d over the next three years, with 2024 flows averaging 3.1 million b/d. Indonesia Dreams Up Refining Boost. The government of Indonesia announced its plan to build a new 530,000 b/d refinery at a cost of $12.5 billion, seeking to end a protracted period of import dependence as Jakarta is not being able to cover roughly 40% of oil and 42% of products demand. Russia Plays Down OPEC+ Expectations. Monday’s OPEC+ meeting where output-cutting members reiterated their plans to unwind production curbs from April shed some $3/bbl from oil prices this week, prompting Russian Deputy Prime Minister Novak to state that OPEC+ could reverse the unwinding after April. East African Nations Crave More Drilling. Tanzania announced it would launch its 5th oil and gas licensing round in May, offering 26 exploration blocks most of which would be located offshore in the Indian Ocean, seeking to build on past discoveries that built some 57 Tcf of natural gas reserves.

Title: Corporate NZ is ‘doubling down’ on diversity, equity and inclusion, Global Women’s new CEO says

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. Global Women CEO Katie Bhreatnach. A rollback of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies at Government and corporate institutions in the United States is not deterring the new New Zealand head of the Global Women initiative, nor its corporate partners. “Companies that I get to work with in this role at Global Women, I don’t see them stepping back, I actually see them doubling down,” Katie Bhreatnach told the Herald ahead of International Women’s Day on March 8. “Businesses here understand that inclusion drives performance.” Global Women’s biggest partners included PwC New Zealand, Toyota New Zealand, Air New Zealand, ANZ Bank, Westpac bank, One NZ (formerly Vodafone), Spark, Fletcher Building, Fonterra, Infratil, NZX and KiwiRail among others. “[But,] globally, we’re seeing rolling back of DEI initiatives and most notably in the US.” Bhreatnach said while New Zealand was not immune to global trends, she suggested New Zealanders could choose to follow them or not. “New Zealand’s always had a unique approach, where we’ve got a history of trailblazers, and we’re always trying to drive that change and challenge ourselves to think about how we can do things differently.” She cited US President Donald Trump’s executive order to terminate DEI targets in the federal workforce’s hiring and promoting processes as a move that undermined decades worth of progress. Yesterday New Zealand First introduced a similar bill to “ensure employment decisions in the public service are based on merit and not on forced woke ‘diversity, equity, and inclusion’ targets,” leader and Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters posted on X. “There are some companies [globally] that are using the current context as an opportunity to backtrack,” Bhreatnach said. “We’ve seen companies like the CEO from BlackRock, Larry Fink, go from saying DEI must be embedded into everything, to there being no references to DEI.” Meta, owner of Facebook and Instagram, Alphabet, parent company of Google, Amazon, Goldman Sachs and McDonald’s were reportedly among companies in the US that had reduced or scrapped diversity initiatives. But some companies had maintained their diversity stance, Bhreatnach pointed out. “We’ve also seen attempts from shareholders to get the Apple board to abandon its DEI policies fail. “They [Apple] put a lot of effort into creating a culture of collaboration where those diverse perspectives come together and create the magic. That is the success for their company.” While the Apple shareholder proposal was rejected, CEO Tim Cook did suggest some of the technology company’s policies may require adjustment for legal reasons. “As the legal landscape around this issue evolves, we may need to make some changes to comply, but our north star of dignity and respect for everyone and our work to that end will never waiver,” Cook said at Apple’s annual shareholder meeting last week. Domestically, Bhreatnach was optimistic New Zealand business leaders would follow Cook’s lead. “I think that New Zealand leaders are smart, and they will see that DEI is actually about ensuring talent has the opportunity to thrive. “The businesses I engage with ... they see DEI not as a compliance exercise that takes away from business strategy. Rather, they see it as a strategic advantage.” When asked at what priority level business executives and board members should place DEI, amid their core business, profitability, safety and climate priorities, she said DEI should be considered key. “Having a great culture and talent, and also future talent strategy, I would suggest, is a key pillar for any successful business. “Every organisation I’ve worked in has structured them differently. “What really matters is the commitment to the clarity of your strategy and vision, and the commitment to executing it and driving it forward.” Bhreatnach said organisations she had worked with previously had flexible work policies, pay equity targets and leadership programmes in place. She was a director of the Global Women organisation for two years before becoming its chief executive in January 2025. Her other roles included chair of The Trusts Arena, director of Dunedin Airport and council member at the tertiary education provider Te Wānanga o Aotearoa. “In all those roles I’ve always bought a passion and commitment to uplifting, and accelerating diverse leadership,” she said of her career. “Fundamentally, I want to be a good ancestor, and leave the world in a better place than how I inherited it. “And so all of my roles, I’ve bought a drive to challenge the status quo.” Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read.

Title: Tokenized Assets Soar To $50 Billion—Is $2 Trillion Inevitable?
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/tokenized-assets-soar-to-50-billion-is-2-trillion-inevitable/
Time Published: 2025-03-07T13:30:08Z

There is a substantial demand for tokenized bonds and real estate. The market for tokenized assets is rapidly growing, with a value that has surpassed $50 billion. Real estate comprises a substantial portion, with tokenized properties totaling $30 billion. Financial analysts anticipate that this figure will continue to increase, with projections indicating that the market could surpass $2 trillion by 2030. Debt tokenization is also on the rise, particularly in Europe. Deutschland is the pioneer in tokenized bond issuance, accounting for nearly 60% of the total. The European Investment Bank, for instance, issued a €100 million digital bond on Ethereum. With clear regulations in place, European financial institutions seem ready to explore tokenized finance even further. According to Brickken’s recent paper, “RWA Tokenization: Key Trends and 2025 Market Outlook,” the market for tokenized assets of all types has now topped $50 billion, with tokenized real estate accounting for $30 billion of that total. This transition is receiving considerable attention from major financial institutions. BlackRock, Ripple, and Coinbase Asset Management are big names that are entering the space and offering tokenized investment products. Another industry participant, Glasstower, is also expanding its services to accommodate the increasing demand. Tokenization offers advantages that conventional finance cannot replicate. It enables the division of assets into smaller, more affordable units, thereby increasing the accessibility of investing. It also enhances the speed and transparency of transactions by utilizing blockchain networks. This configuration appears to be well-received by investors, and companies are striving to remain competitive. Better regulatory support is one factor contributing to the rapid expansion of tokenized assets. In particular, Europe has implemented regulations that facilitate the operation of institutions in this domain. The legal framework of the European Union has provided financial institutions with the assurance necessary to introduce new products and services that are associated with blockchain technology. In the United States, regulatory discussions are continuing. Some companies are being cautious, waiting for firmer standards before fully committing. Despite this, tokenized funds, real estate, and bonds remain popular among investors seeking innovative methods to hold and build their capital. Many believe that tokenization will become a standard feature of the financial industry, with a projected value of $2 trillion by 2030. More banks, financial institutions, and tech firms are expected to enter the market and offer investors new services. Debt securities and tokenized real estate demonstrate how blockchain technology is revolutionizing the way people invest.

More Info Indonesia has started replacing diesel as a fuel in dozens of power plants with LNG, which is set to boost demand for natural gas in one of the world’s top LNG exporters. Following a decade of delays, Indonesia finally launched a $1.5 billion project to distribute LNG on a small scale to power dozens of plants that currently run on diesel, Reuters reports. PLN EPI, a fuel procurement and transportation operator for Indonesia’s largest power company, PLN, is leading the project. Last year, Japan’s JERA signed a collaboration agreement with PLN EPI to collaborate in LNG procurement, optimization, and the development and operation of LNG receiving terminals in anticipation of growing demand for LNG in Indonesia. By utilizing JERA’s LNG expertise, JERA and PLN EPI will establish an LNG value chain for the power segment in Indonesia, the companies said. The project will need more LNG supply in the future, and could lead to Indonesia turning to LNG imports later this decade, according to estimates reported by Reuters. “We are obliged to provide the LNG ... And we are keen on securing more domestic LNG for the project,” Rakhmad Dewanto, director of fuels and gas at PLN EPI, told Reuters. Early this year, Indonesia reportedly asked its buyers to accept delays to Indonesian LNG cargo exports this year, as the Southeast Asian country looks to meet rising domestic energy and gas demand. Indonesia has one major LNG project planned for later this decade. Japan’s oil and gas producer Inpex owns 65% of the Abadi gas project and plans a final investment decision (FID) for the $20-billion Abadi LNG project by 2027. Abadi LNG has seen years of delays as it has had to change design concepts and then reorganize after supermajor Shell withdrew from the project nearly two years ago. The Abadi LNG project in Indonesia has received interest from potential buyers to purchase gas from the facility in volumes exceeding the facility’s design capacity, according to Inpex.

ByBilly Bambrough ByBilly Bambrough , Senior Contributor. U.S. president Donald Trump has signed an executive order, calling for the establishment of a U.S bitcoin strategic reserve and stockpile of other cryptocurrencies, following through on a campaign promise that some think could push the bitcoin price sharply higher. Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes’ CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" The bitcoin price dipped after it was revealed Trump had signed the order, falling as traders expressed their disappointment it doesn’t commit the U.S. to buying more bitcoin or crypto (and following a “foolish” crypto price warning from Elon Musk). Now, as the bitcoin and crypto market braces for a BlackRock earthquake, traders are scrambling to get ahead of other countries rushing to follow the U.S. into bitcoin—with one analyst predicting a $10 trillion bitcoin market capitalization by 2028. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run U.S. president Donald Trump has signed a flurry of executive orders, including one to establish a ... [+] bitcoin strategic reserve—predicted by some to trigger a bitcoin price boom. "Incredible execution from the Trump administration and a historic moment for bitcoin and crypto," Coinbase chief executive Brian Armstrong posted to X. "I expect many of the G20 to take notice, and eventually follow America’s leadership." The bitcoin reserve "will be capitalized with bitcoin owned by the federal government that was forfeited as part of criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings," David Sacks, Trump's crypto czar, posted to X alongside a video showing Sacks calling the reserve a "digital Fort Knox" and promising it "won't cost taxpayers a dime." Some have speculated that China is weighing creating its own bitcoin reserve to rival the U.S. after Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund revealed last month it’s betting on bitcoin, kicking off a global adoption “race." “There have been rumours about China and South Korea exploring their own bitcoin strategic reserves,” Danny Scott, the chief executive at crypto platform CoinCorner, said in emailed comments. “It goes without saying now that all countries around the world will be paying attention and be looking at how they make their move," adding: "It's going to happen globally." Trump’s bitcoin reserve executive order follows the announcement over the weekend that the U.S. will create a diverse crypto stockpile, cheered by the market as a “game-changer.” “This week’s announcement—as imperfect as it is—marks the first time the U.S. has ever said that bitcoin is a strategic asset,” Bitwise’s chief investment officer Matt Hougan wrote in a blog post. “As long as that stays intact, it feels like a game-changer to me.” Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price shot higher following the election of Donald Trump, with the bitcoin price ...

Hougan said other countries would likely be watching the U.S. and considering following suit in creating bitcoin reserves. “If you are Honduras, Mexico, or Guatemala, and you’re watching El Salvador and now the U.S. acquire bitcoin, can you really afford to be at zero?” Hougan asked. “If you’re Dubai, Qatar, or Saudi Arabia, are you comfortable with Abu Dhabi and the U.S. taking the lead? What about Russia? China?” Excitement over a potential global race toward bitcoin adoption has added to expectations of increased crypto regulatory clarity in the U.S. under the Trump administration. "That should add to that medium term, top-side potential, which for me is bitcoin up to $200,000 this year, and $500,000 before Trump leaves office,” Standard Chartered Bank’s Geoffrey Kendrick told CNBC, which would give bitcoin a market capitalization of around $10 trillion.

March 07, 2025 02:00 ET | Source: Alliance Witan PLC Alliance Witan PLC Alliance Witan PLC (‘the Company’)LEI: 213800SZZD4E2IOZ9W55 7 March 2025 A landmark year Annual results for the year ended 31 December 2024 Highlights Dean Buckley, Chair of Alliance Witan, commented: “The Company delivered strong outright gains for shareholders in 2024, although in common with most active global equity strategies, we underperformed our benchmark index, MSCI ACWI, where performance was concentrated in a handful of the largest US companies. Even so, the Company’s longer-term performance remains competitive, and demand for our shares was healthy last year, with the Company's discount narrowing, bucking the industry trend towards widening discounts. We also increased our dividend for the 58th consecutive year. “Thanks to the support of both sets of shareholders, we achieved a historic combination with Witan, which places the Company in a strong position to realise economies of scale and offer better liquidity for our shares. With solid performance and a refreshed brand, supported by a marketing campaign that will continue in 2025, the Board is confident that the Company is well placed to continue delivering attractive returns for shareholders”. About Alliance Witan PLC Alliance Witan aims to be a core investment that beats inflation over the long term through a combination of capital growth and rising dividend.

Share Price Total Return is the return to shareholders through share price capital returns and dividends paid by the Company and re-invested. Net Asset Value (NAV) Total Return is a measure of the performance of the Company’s NAV over a specified time period. It combines any change in the NAV and dividends paid.

Notes: NAV per Share including income with debt at fair value. NAV Total Return based on NAV including income with debt at fair value and after all costs. Source: Morningstar and Juniper Partners Limited (‘Juniper’). Chair’s Statement 2024 was a landmark year for your Company. I would like to begin by thanking you for your support for the combination of Alliance Trust and Witan to form Alliance Witan and by welcoming all shareholders who have joined us as a result. This was a pivotal moment in our history, achieving economies of scale and elevating the Company to the FTSE 100. Now, as one of the industry’s leaders, this status will provide better liquidity for our shares and, with good long term investment performance and a strong brand, help us attract new investors. We made a number of commitments to investors as part of the proposals, for example in respect of dividends and costs, and you will see as you read through the Annual Report how we have achieved each of these. As I mentioned in the Interim Report for the six months ended 30 June 2024, there has been no change to the Company’s investment strategy, just a larger pool of assets for our Investment Manager, WTW, to manage with the same professionalism that it has brought to the job since April 2017. 1. https://www.theaic.co.uk/aic/news/press-releases/top-20-best-performing-investment-trusts-for-your-isa Investment Performance It was another good year for global equity markets, and your Company delivered strong absolute returns. NAV Total Return was 13.3% and, due to a narrowing of the discount, Share Price Total Return was 14.3%. However, we lagged our benchmark index, the MSCI All Country World Index (‘MSCI ACWI’ or ‘Index’), which returned 19.6%. We also marginally underperformed our peers in the AIC Global Sector, which is disappointing, but we were slightly ahead of the much wider, more representative Morningstar peer group of open and closed-ended global equity funds. Simply put, our relative performance in 2024 suffered from not having enough exposure to the small number of very large companies that dominated market returns, especially in the US. The narrowness of returns from global equity markets has been a common problem for all active managers in recent years, and we take comfort from the fact that, despite this persistent headwind, we are ahead of the Index and have significantly outperformed both peer groups over three years. You can read more about the contributors/detractors to the Company’s investment performance during 2024 in the Investment Manager’s Report on page 9 of the Annual Report. Dividend increased for the 58th consecutive year The Board declared a fourth interim dividend of 6.73p per share on 28 January 2025, resulting in a full year dividend of 26.70p, an increase of 6.0% on the prior year. This fulfils the promise we made at the time of the combination of Alliance Trust and Witan to increase dividends for the legacy shareholders of both companies. 2024’s increase marks the 58th consecutive annual increase, which is one of the longest track records in the investment trust industry. Dividends are well supported by revenue and reserves, and the Board is confident annual dividend increases can continue well into the future. Due to our steady approach, the Company has received a ‘Dividend Hero’ investment company award from the Association of Investment Companies (‘AIC’). Narrowing discount Many investment trusts continued to trade on large discounts to NAV throughout 2024, with the industry average widening to 14.7% from 12.7%.1 I am pleased to report that your Company fared better than most, with its average discount falling to 4.7% from 5.4% over the year. This compared favourably with the average discount for the AIC Global Sector of 7.9%. Your Board remains committed to the maintenance of a stable discount. We will continue to use share buybacks as appropriate and invest in promotional activity to widen our shareholder base, to support the management of the discount. During 2024, the Company bought back 4.7 million shares (1.2% of shares in issue2), versus 8.6 million repurchased in 2023. The shares bought back during the year were placed in Treasury. This level of buybacks was significantly below that of our peers, in a year in which industry-wide buybacks hit a record level of £7.5 billion3. The shares held in Treasury can be reissued by the Company at a premium to estimated NAV when there is market demand. Board changes Following the completion of the combination of Alliance Trust with Witan, we welcomed four new Non-Executive Directors to the Board: Andrew Ross, Rachel Beagles, Shauna Bevan and Jack Perry, all of whom were former directors of Witan. Clare Dobie, having served for almost nine years, is retiring as a Director at the conclusion of this year’s Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’), as is Jack Perry, reducing the size of the Board to eight members. On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank Clare and Jack for their contributions. Annual General Meeting The Board looks forward to being able to meet shareholders again at this year’s AGM, which will be held at the Apex City Quay Hotel in Dundee on 1 May 2025. For those shareholders who are not able to attend in person, we will be live streaming the event. As well as the formal business of the meeting, there will be an investor forum afterwards featuring two of our Stock Pickers, Jennison and EdgePoint, as well as members of WTW’s investment team. There will be another in-person investor forum in London in the autumn. In addition, shareholders can engage with the Company and its Stock Pickers via online presentations during the year. Further details of how to attend all these events can be found on the website. The Board would strongly encourage shareholders to use the opportunity to have their say and use their vote at the AGM. Further information on the arrangements for the AGM, including information on how to vote either directly through the Registrar or though different platforms, is on pages 134 and 135 of the Annual Report. Keep up-to-date In these unusual times, the website will provide timely updates to shareholders. Therefore, I would encourage you to visit the website which contains a vast amount of information on investment performance, details of shareholder meetings and investor forums, monthly factsheets, quarterly newsletters, and Stock Picker updates, as well as the Annual and Interim Reports. As always, the Board welcomes communication from shareholders and I can be contacted through Juniper Partners (‘Juniper’), the Company Secretary at investor@alliancewitan.com. Outlook Since the start of President Trump’s second term of office in January, tariffs have created uncertainty about the outlook for equities. Diplomatic tensions over efforts to end the war in Ukraine and conflict in Gaza have also raised geopolitical risks. Furthermore, European bond markets are adjusting to the prospect of increased borrowing to fund higher levels of defence and infrastructure spending. While there is a risk that heightened levels of uncertainty will impact on business and consumer confidence, global growth and corporate earnings forecasts are currently healthy, giving some grounds for cautious optimism, about further gains for shareholders, especially if there is a broadening out of market leadership. While the Index is highly concentrated, your portfolio has broader exposure to many good businesses that have not yet received the market recognition our Stock Pickers believe they deserve. The portfolio will not always outperform the market in every discrete period, but we believe it will continue to add significant value for shareholders in the long run. I look forward to meeting as many of you as possible at the AGM in Dundee or the next investor forum in London. 1. Weighted average discount (excluding 3i Group). Source: Winterflood. 2.

Dean BuckleyChair6 March 2025 Combination with Witan The most significant development during the year under review was the combination of the Company with Witan. Background Following a comprehensive review of management arrangements, the Witan Board concluded that a combination with the Company was in the best interests of Witan’s shareholders. Amongst other things this allowed them continued exposure to a successful multi-manager approach. The combination was undertaken by way of a scheme of reconstruction and members’ voluntary liquidation of Witan. The scheme required the approval of both the Company and Witan’s shareholders and took effect on 10 October 2024. It resulted in the Company acquiring approximately £1,539 million of net assets from Witan in consideration for the issue of new ordinary shares to Witan shareholders. The name of the Company became Alliance Witan and the stock exchange ticker ALW. Outcome The combination was expected to result in substantial benefits for all shareholders and future investors. The outcomes of the key elements of the proposals include: Portfolio Transition Investment Manager’s Report Market backdrop: equities untroubled by politics For the second year running, global equities delivered strong returns in 2024, with economics trumping politics. Despite a record number of elections, conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine reaching new heights, and a scary moment in Japan when the Nikkei Index of the top 225 blue-chip shares plunged 12% in a day at the beginning of August, investors focused on resilient global growth, falling inflation and interest rates, and healthy corporate profitability. Hence, our benchmark index, the MSCI ACWI, returned 19.6% in 2024 following a return of 15.3% in 2023. Since 1987, the Index has returned an average of 8.4% per annum1, so returns of this magnitude in two consecutive years are rare. The ebullient mood of equity investors was reflected in a surge in the prices of less established assets, such as cryptocurrency, with Bitcoin reaching all-time highs of over $100,000. Peanut the Squirrel Coin, a cryptocurrency named after the eponymous pet that New York environmental authorities seized and euthanised on 30 October 2024, at one point commanded a market cap of $1.7 billion. However, regional equity market performance was mixed. US markets once again led the way, with the S&P 500 delivering a 27% return when measured in British pounds. Chinese equities rallied briefly following government stimulus, but concerns over the country’s property market and trade tensions persisted. Together with a strong US dollar, these worries led to more subdued returns from emerging markets, which rose about 9%. In Japan, August’s technically driven decline proved temporary, and the Nikkei resumed its ascent to close the year at a record high, although the yen’s depreciation reduced returns for UK-based investors when converted into British pounds. The UK and European markets were more muted, with the FTSE All Share Index and the MSCI Europe ex UK Index returning 9.5% and 1.9% respectively. Gains driven by US tech giants Giant US technology related stocks were the standout performers, fuelled by investor excitement about generative artificial intelligence (‘AI’) and, from November onwards, hopes that Donald Trump’s victory in the presidential election would weaken regulatory scrutiny. The share prices of the so called “Magnificent Seven” – Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, NVIDIA and Tesla – increased by 60% on average and were responsible for 43% of MSCI ACWI’s gains. This was less than 2023 when they contributed 53%, but still a huge number emphasising the extreme concentration of index returns in a small number of companies. Even so, from mid-year onwards, returns were no longer quite as skewed to the performance of a handful of shares. Although NVIDIA and Tesla returned a massive 176% and 65% respectively, giant tech was not the only game in town. Financial stocks returned 26.5%, and returns from the consumer discretionary, industrial and utility sectors were also well into double figures, pointing to the potential broadening out of market returns as stock-specific drivers came to the fore. 1. https://www.msci.com/documents/10199/8d97d244-4685-4200-a24c-3e2942e3adeb Portfolio performance: strong absolute gains but lagged benchmark index Our portfolio’s NAV Total Return was a robust 13.3% but, as with most active managers, it lagged the Company’s benchmark index. The portfolio does, however, remain ahead of the Index over three years (28.0% vs 26.8%), albeit behind over five years (64.7% vs 70.8%). Disappointing though it was not to beat the MSCI ACWI in 2024, we were not alone. AJ Bell calculated that, to the end of November, just 18% of active global equity funds outperformed their passive peers, largely due to their inability to match high Index weightings in the “Magnificent Seven”. The sheer size of these companies in the Index is mind boggling. NVIDIA, Microsoft and Apple, for example, represent 13% of the MSCI ACWI as at 31 December 2024 and, together, are bigger than the entire stock markets of several sizeable countries. The skew of the Index towards mega-cap companies has been a challenge, to varying degrees, since the start of our multi-manager strategy in April 2017. As a broadly diversified strategy, with capital spread between 8-12 Managers, all with different approaches to investing, our portfolio naturally has a structural bias away from stocks that on rare occasions represent such a large proportion of our global benchmark. While we have some exposure to most of the “Magnificent Seven”, it would require a lot of the Managers to choose them as one of their best ideas for us to be at Index weight, never mind be overweight. The Index may have been hard to beat in recent years, but market concentration poses significant risks for passive strategies. At the end of 2024, the Index on average allocated around 150 times as much capital to each of Apple, NVIDIA and Microsoft as it did to the average stock, akin to us placing about 95% of the portfolio in one manager’s hands and 0.5% each in the other ten. We do not believe this is the right way to manage risk for shareholders, bearing in mind that index trackers are not investing lots of money in these companies because they are good businesses trading at good valuations, but because they are very big. If US large-cap stocks continue to dominate, tracker funds may continue to outperform active funds. But if sentiment on the technology sector turns sour, passive funds with big stakes will be hit much harder. Not owning enough NVIDIA was painful The strong outperformance of our portfolio versus our benchmark in 2023 continued into the first quarter of 2024, when the biggest contribution came from not owning, at that time, poorly performing Tesla and Apple. But thereafter stock selection became more challenging, particularly within the “Magnificent Seven”. Although we benefitted from owning Amazon and Microsoft, we moved from an overweight to an underweight position in NVIDIA in the first quarter after its extraordinary outperformance, which then made it our biggest single detractor last year as that outperformance continued. Having helped us in the first quarter, the lack of exposure to Tesla and Apple, which both recovered strongly as the year progressed, counted against us from then on. Overall, our positions in the “Magnificent Seven” accounted for a third of the portfolio’s underperformance versus the Index in 2024. The remainder of the portfolio’s underperformance came from a combination of being underweight in large-cap stocks in general and stock specific issues elsewhere, in some cases due to partial reversals of performance in 2023. For example, stock selection in financials detracted in large part due to our relative lack of exposure to strongly performing US banks such as JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs. In the consumer discretionary sector, the share price of UK-based drinks company Diageo, owned by Veritas Asset Management (‘Veritas’) and Metropolis Capital (‘Metropolis’), continued to suffer from a post-Covid cyclical downturn, falling 8.5%, although both Managers believe the company will eventually recover lost ground when structural trends reassert themselves. Novo Nordisk, the Danish weight loss drugs company, was another notable detractor, as its shares fell 14% after disappointing test results. Our Stock Pickers see this as a temporary decline in a growing market in which Novo Nordisk has a leading position. Hence, it was one of our biggest purchases in 2024 (see table below). Indeed, our Stock Pickers express a high degree of confidence in the latent value of many of their holdings. By far the most important long run ingredient underpinning share price performance is strong fundamentals, such as market-leading products or services, solid profit margins, plentiful cashflow and strong management. Top 10 purchases and sales Source: Juniper. The purchases and sales are calculated by taking the net value of all transactions (buy and sells) for each holding held within the portfolio over the period. The tables exclude any non-equity holdings such as ETFs and any transfers from the combination with Witan. Even so, in the short run, market sentiment can have a larger impact on share prices than fundamentals. When we break down the portfolio performance against the Index into fundamentals and sentiment, the portfolio’s strong absolute performance has been mainly as a result of company fundamentals, whereas the Index’s absolute performance has been more driven by market sentiment. A full breakdown of the contributors to our Total Return in 2024 is shown in the following table. Contribution analysis Source: Performance and attribution data sourced from WTW, Juniper, MSCI Inc, FactSet and Morningstar as at 31 December 2024. Percentages may not add due to rounding. In the table below, we also list the top five contributors and detractors to portfolio performance during the year relative to the portfolio’s benchmark. Sands, Vulcan and Lyrical were the top performers As we would expect from such a diverse line up, performance among our Managers was mixed. This is by design, as we do not want the portfolio to be biased towards any one approach of investing, which might make returns vulnerable to a sudden switch from one style to another. This happened in 2022 when growth stocks began to suffer significantly as central banks raised interest rates to combat inflation. Sands Capital (‘Sands’), Vulcan Value Partners (‘Vulcan’), and Lyrical Asset Management (‘Lyrical’) were the top performers last year. Sands and Vulcan both benefitted from owning tech giants. Sands held NVIDIA while Vulcan held Amazon, but Sands’ largest contributor to relative performance was Axon Enterprise, an industrial business which makes tasers, body cameras and other software products. Its share price surged by 134% last year. Top five stock contributors to performance Bottom five stock detractors to performance Source: WTW. The tables above illustrate the top five contributors and detractors to returns relative to benchmark in 2024. It aims to explain at a stock level which companies drove relative returns. For example, the Alliance Witan portfolio was underweight relative to benchmark in NVIDIA, Broadcom, Tesla and Apple. These stocks had very strong returns, which hurt our portfolio’s relative performance. Conversely, not having an exposure to Nestle helped our relative performance given the stock was held in the benchmark and was down over the year. Our overweight position in Amazon, Axon Enterprise, Salesforce and NRG Energy contributed positively to relative returns given their strong performance. The average active weight is the arithmetic simple average weight of the stock in the portfolio minus the arithmetic simple average weight of the stock in the benchmark over the period. Vulcan’s largest contributor to our performance was KKR, the US-based private equity group, which returned 82%, prompting Vulcan to take profits. Its holding in Salesforce also did well, rising nearly 30%. Lyrical, a deep-value style investor, benefitted from owning several less talked-about US-based companies, which all rebounded from cheap valuations. These included NRG Energy, Ameriprise Financials and eBay. Of our Managers, the most notable laggard was Sustainable Growth Advisors (‘SGA’), which was disappointing given its focus on large cap growth stocks which, as a group, had the strongest price momentum. SGA suffered from holding Novo Nordisk, and two of its other positions, ICON and Synopsys also stood out as detractors. The recent poor performance of SGA follows a long period of outperformance, so returns since we appointed SGA remain strong. Value Managers Metropolis and ARGA Investment Management (‘ARGA’), the latter replacing Jupiter Asset Management (‘Jupiter’) in April, also struggled in the recent market environment, which has generally favoured growth managers. Portfolio changes: two new Managers added after combination with Witan As well as adding ARGA for Jupiter in the first half of the year, following Ben Whitmore’s decision to leave Jupiter to set up his own business, there were two further changes to the Manager line-up during the integration of Witan’s portfolio. Altogether, this contributed to an unusually high level of turnover of 98.5% of the portfolio in 2024. Both Alliance Trust and Witan already had GQG Partners (‘GQG’) and Veritas in common, which meant that there were some in-specie transfers of stocks. Additionally, the combination of Alliance and Witan presented us with an opportunity to introduce Jennison Associates (‘Jennison’) to the portfolio at a low cost. Based in the US, Jennison specialises in investing in innovative, fast-growing businesses. It had been one of Witan’s most successful managers and blending it with our other Managers increased the diversity of holdings in growth companies. We also took the opportunity to replace Black Creek Investment Management (‘Black Creek’) with EdgePoint Investment Group (‘EdgePoint’), while we were using a transition manager to keep costs down to a minimum. This change was prompted by succession planning at Black Creek. We had been monitoring Black Creek for some time due to the departure of a senior team member for health reasons and the uncertainty surrounding the timing of founder Bill Kanko’s retirement. With a similar investment style to Black Creek, EdgePoint seeks to buy good, undervalued businesses and hold them until the market fully realises their potential. Through the combination, we inherited a small number of investment trust and private equity fund holdings, representing less than 3% of the combined portfolio. These are specialist funds with portfolios focused on, among other things, early-stage life sciences, valuable intellectual property, innovative internet platforms and renewable infrastructure assets. Collective investments such as these are not normally part of our investment strategy. However, they are all trading at prices we believe are well below their intrinsic value, so rather than sell them at a loss, we will hold them until we can achieve attractive values. Beyond that, the combination did not lead to any change in our investment approach. We retain high conviction in our line-up of Managers and their ability to pick winning stocks, although we keep them under constant review for any red flags and have access to a deep bench of talented replacements should these be needed. Gearing: remaining cautious Our gross gearing stood at 8.4% at the end of 2024 (4.9% net of underlying Manager and central cash), slightly above the level of 7.1% at the start of the year, reflecting the improving outlook for equities as the year progressed. However, given the strong performance from equity markets, it is still towards the lower end of the typical range of 7.5 to 12.5%. Market outlook: multiple risks warrant diversification As 2025 began, the mood among investors was upbeat, with many hoping President Trump’s promises of deregulation and tax cuts would be supportive of equity markets. If returns can spread beyond a narrow group of highly valued US mega-cap technology stocks, it could provide firmer foundations for another good year for shares. The strong start to the year for European equities certainly offered hope for geographical diversification. However, on-off tariffs and geopolitical tensions loom large, creating considerable uncertainty. This was reflected in an increase in equity market volatility in February. In the first 2 months of 2025, the benchmark index rose by 2.2% suggesting that investors were still willing to look through some of the risks while forecast global growth and corporate earnings remain healthy. But confidence is fragile and, with valuations in the US still close to a record high despite February’s pullback, the market is vulnerable to setbacks. In this environment, we believe bottom-up stock picking, based on company fundamentals, should be a more reliable way to add value for shareholders in the long term than making bold, top-down market calls. So, we will continue to position the portfolio to maintain balanced regional, sector and style exposures, that are similar to the Index weightings by periodically adjusting Manager allocations. This should provide stability and reduce risk, while we rely on our Managers to add value by seeking out the best companies in each market segment. While retaining some exposure to US mega-cap tech stocks that may continue delivering attractive returns, our portfolio is not reliant on them. It also contains many stocks that have remained in the shadows but have been performing well operationally and have excellent prospects not yet reflected in their share prices. Hidden gems: stock picks with high potential We asked our eleven Stock Pickers for examples of strong but underappreciated companies in the portfolio Lyrical highlighted five of its US holdings that have underperformed the S&P 500 Index since the start of 2024 but, at the same time, have grown their forecast earnings per share by more than the Index. These are healthcare providers Cigna and HCA, WEX and Global Payments, which both provide business-to-business payment technology, and Gen Digital, which is a leading provider of cyber security and identity protection. “Interestingly, even on this list there is inconsistency by the market,” says Lyrical. “Cigna has the worst stock performance, but the second-best earnings per share (‘EPS’) growth. Gen Digital has the slowest EPS growth in the group, but the best performance”. ARGA cited Accor, the global hotel business, which has transitioned to an “asset light” business model by selling most of its hotels, while maintaining the lucrative franchise and management agreements attached to these properties. While Sands Capital sees potential in the share prices of Sika, a maintenance and building refurbishment specialist. “Investment results have been weak despite solid fundamental results,” says Sands. “We believe that investors have focused on slower than historical organic growth, caused by several factors, including the real estate crisis in China, slowdown in electric vehicle production, and a pause in green building incentives.” Sands Capital also mentioned Roper Technologies, a diversified industrial technology company, and Keyence, a leading designer of high-end factory automation based in Japan, as attractive businesses with share price appreciation potential. Vulcan highlighted CoStar Group, an information provider to the commercial and residential real estate industries, and Everest Group, a global insurance and reinsurance business, while GQG mentioned the UK-based pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca, the Brazil-based oil and gas company Petrobras, Bank Mandiri in Indonesia, and the Indian tobacco company ITC. SGA backed Danaher, the US industrial group, Intuit, which provides do-it-yourself accounting software for small businesses, and HDFC Bank in India. Jennison highlighted Reddit, the online social media platform. “Reddit is targeting 49% growth in the third quarter of 2024 and consensus is at 41% in Q4, but then market estimates are fading down to around 20% in 2025, which we think is overly conservative and creates an opportunity for investment today.” Veritas’s nominations for underappreciated businesses were Amadeus, the Spanish software company focusing on air travel, The Cooper Companies, which makes contact lenses, and Thermo Fisher Scientific, the world’s largest scientific equipment provider. Japan specialist Dalton’s best stocks included Bandai Namco, a multinational that publishes video games and makes toys, Shimano, the bicycle equipment manufacturer, and Rinnai, one of the global leaders in water heaters. Metropolis highlighted Andritz, the Austrian headquartered business supplying industrial equipment to the pulp and paper, metals and hydropower industries, Crown Holdings, which makes aluminium drinks cans, and Admiral, the UK insurer. Finally, EdgePoint, the newest addition to our Manager line-up, pointed to Dayforce, a global human resources software company, Nippon Paints Holdings in Japan, Franco-Nevada, a gold-focused royalty company in Canada, and Qualcomm, which invented significant pieces of the underlying technology required for mobile phones. “The market looks at Qualcomm as a handset supplier and the stock moves in relation to expected handset sales over the following quarters,” says EdgePoint. “We consider Qualcomm to be one of the world’s leading designers of energy-efficient processors at a point in time when demand for energy-efficient processing is growing rapidly across a wide range of industries. Some of the major opportunities for Qualcomm over the next 5 years include artificial intelligence, automobiles, personal computers and smartphones.” Altogether, these fundamentally strong businesses combine with others to create a robust, multi-manager portfolio that offers attractive long-term growth with lower risk than a single manager strategy, and therefore a more comfortable ride through the ups and downs of the market. Such companies may have remained below the radar in 2024, when investors became giddy with the stellar returns from the US technology shares, but we look forward to their attributes receiving the recognition from the market that they deserve.

Dividend We have paid our shareholders a rising dividend for 58 consecutive years. Providing that level of reliability is something of which we are extremely proud. We carefully manage the Company’s dividend. For instance, should there be a year in which income is unexpectedly high, we may retain some of that income to help fund future dividends. Due to our steady approach, the Company has received a ‘Dividend Hero’ investment company award from the Association of Investment Companies (‘AIC’). Our dividend policy Subject to market conditions and the Company’s performance, financial position and outlook, the Board will seek to pay a dividend that increases year on year. The Company expects to pay four interim dividends per year, on or around the last day of June, September, December and March, and will not, generally, pay a final dividend for a particular financial year. While shareholders are not asked to approve a final dividend, given the timing of the payment of the quarterly payments, each year they are given the opportunity to share their views when they are asked to approve the Company’s Dividend Policy. Fourth interim dividend As previously announced, a fourth interim dividend of 6.73p per ordinary share will be paid on 31 March 2025 to those shareholders who were on the register at close of business on 28 February 2025. Increased dividend The Company has increased its total dividend for the year ended 31 December 2024 to 26.7p per ordinary share (2023: 25.2p), a 6.0% increase on the previous year. Reserves It is the Board’s intention to utilise distributable reserves as well as portfolio income to fund dividend payments. Further details of the dividend payments for the year to 31 December 2024 and information on distributable reserves can be found in notes 7 and 2(b)(x) of the Financial Statements, respectively. Ongoing Charges and Discount Ongoing charges1 The Company’s ongoing charges ratio (‘OCR’) decreased to 0.56% (including the impact of the investment management fee waiver) (2023: 0.62%). Total administrative expenses were £3.9m (2023: £2.9m) and investment management expenses were £18.4m (2023: £16.3m). Further details of the Company’s expenses are provided in note 4 of the Financial Statements on page 90 of the Annual Report. The Company’s costs remain competitive for an actively managed multi-manager global equity strategy. Maintaining a stable discount1 One of the Company’s strategic objectives is to maintain a stable share price discount to NAV. The Company has the authority to buy back its own shares in the market if the discount is widening and to hold these shares in Treasury. During the year under review, the Company’s share price traded at an average discount of 4.7% (2023: 6.0%). As at 31 December 2024, the Company’s share price discount was 4.7% (2023: 5.4%). The average discount (unweighted) for the AIC Global Sector was 7.9%. Share issuance and buybacks As a result of the combination with Witan, 120,949,382 new ordinary shares were issued for assets valued at £1.5bn implying an effective issue price of £12.7459246 per share. The Company bought back 1.2%* (2023: 3.0%) of its issued share capital during the year, purchasing 4,722,000 shares which were placed in Treasury. The total cost of the share buybacks was £57.0m (2023: £86.6m). The weighted average discount of shares bought back in the year was 5.7%. Share buybacks contributed a total of 0.1% to the Company’s NAV performance in the year. 1.

What We Do How WTW manages the portfolio WTW as Investment Manager has overall responsibility for managing the Company’s portfolio. It is the Investment Manager’s job to select a diverse team of expert Stock Pickers, each of whom invest in a customised selection of 10-20 of their ‘best ideas’. WTW then allocates capital to them, relative to the risks the Stock Picker represents. For example, small-cap stocks are typically more risky than large-cap stocks, so on average a small-cap specialist would tend to receive less capital than a Stock Picker who focuses on large-cap stocks. However, the allocations do not remain static; WTW keeps them under constant review and varies them over time according to market conditions, with the goal of keeping our exposures to different parts of global stocks markets well balanced. Stock Pickers are encouraged to ignore the benchmark and only buy a small number of stocks in which they have strong conviction, while WTW manages risk through the Stock Picker allocations. On their own, each of the Stock Picker’s high-conviction mandates has the potential to perform well. This is supported by WTW’s experience of managing high-conviction portfolios and academic evidence1. But concentrated selections of stocks can be volatile and risky, so WTW mitigates these dangers by blending Stock Pickers with complementary investment approaches or styles, which can be expected to perform differently in different market conditions. This smooths out the peaks and troughs of performance associated with concentrated single-manager strategies. Several of the Stock Pickers in the current portfolio have been with the Investment Manager since inception of the multi-manager strategy, though it does actively monitor and rearrange the line-up where necessary. WTW invests a lot of time and effort on identifying skilled Stock Pickers for the Company’s portfolio, undertaking extensive qualitative and quantitative analysis. This due diligence process focuses on: 1. Sebastian & Attaluri, Conviction in Equity Investing, The Journal of Portfolio Management, Summer 2014. The Investment Manager’s views are formed over extended periods from multiple interactions with the Managers, including regular meetings. They look beyond past performance numbers to try to understand the ‘competitive edge’. This involves examining and interrogating processes for selecting stocks, adherence to this process through different market conditions, team dynamics, training and experience. Performance track records are just a single data point, and, without the context of the additional information, they are unlikely to persuade WTW that a Stock Picker is skilled. Once selected, the Investment Manager tends to form long-term partnerships with the Stock Pickers, generally only taking them out of the portfolio if something fundamental changes, such as the departure of a key individual from the business or a change in business strategy or fortunes. With highly active, concentrated portfolios, periods of short-term underperformance are to be expected and are not a reason to doubt a Stock Picker if they are adhering to their philosophy and process. WTW does, however, keep a constant eye out for talent and may bring new Managers into the portfolio at the expense of an incumbent if they are a better fit. Responsible investment WTW believes that Environmental, Social and Governance (‘ESG’) factors have the potential to impact financial risk and return. As long-term investors, WTW aims to incorporate these factors into its investment process. As stewards of the Company’s assets, WTW seeks to integrate responsible investment into its process for managing the portfolio. ESG factors can influence returns, so these risk factors are taken into account in WTW’s investment processes, including assessing how Managers evaluate ESG risk in their decisions over what stocks to purchase. Climate change poses potential significant risks to investment returns from many companies, which is why both WTW and the Company have stated an intention to manage the assets with a goal of achieving Net Zero greenhouse gas emissions from the portfolio by 2050, with an interim intention of reducing portfolio emissions by approximately 50% by 2030, relative to 2019. In 2024, we saw an increase in the portfolio’s weighted average carbon intensity (which measures carbon emissions as a proportion of revenue) from 71.9tCO2e/$M sales to 117. 9tCO2e/$M sales. Over the year, some higher-emitting stocks came into the portfolio including, industrial company Alaska Air and materials company Alcoa Ord, and our allocation to the higher-emitting Utilities sector went up slightly with purchases of companies such as Southern Ord and American Electric Power. We are monitoring our progress against our Net Zero goal, and our Managers and EOS at Federated Hermes (‘EOS’) continue to engage with the companies in the portfolio on climate related issues. Progress towards Net Zero will not be linear. Emissions from the portfolio are dependent on holdings, which can change from year to year as WTW’s Stock Pickers seek value for investors. If companies are perceived as being at higher financial risk by being slow to adapt to a Net Zero world, we expect to use stewardship, such as voting and engagement, to encourage positive changes to business practices. WTW believes this is preferable to excluding companies from the portfolio, since exclusion merely passes the responsibility of ownership to other investors who may be less scrupulous about adherence to ESG standards or regulation. As well as engaging with companies on climate change, WTW’s Stock Pickers, together with stewardship provider EOS, focused on a wide range of other issues last year. Overall, EOS engaged with 97 companies in the portfolio on 515 issues and objectives throughout the year. Key areas of engagement included board effectiveness, climate change, human and labour rights and human capital, biodiversity, digital rights and AI. Of these engagements, the environmental category accounted for 29% of the total number of engagements, with 63% of environmental engagements relating to climate change. Meanwhile the Stock Pickers cast votes at 3,346 resolutions in 2024. Of these resolutions, they voted against company management on 386 and abstained from voting on 38 occasions. How We Manage Our Risks In order to monitor and manage risks facing the Company, the Board maintains and regularly reviews a risk register and heat map. The risk register details all principal and emerging risks thought to face the Company at any given time. The principal risks facing the Company, as determined by the Board, are Investment, Operational and Legal and Regulatory Non-Compliance. As part of its review process, the Board considers input on the principal and emerging risks facing the Company from its key service providers WTW and Juniper. Any risks and their associated risk ratings are then discussed, and the risk register and heat map updated accordingly, with additional measures put in place to monitor, manage and mitigate risks as required. During the period the Board carefully reviewed the risks associated with the implementation of the combination and the post transaction integration risks. Principal risks The principal risks facing the Company, how they have changed during the year and how the Board aims to monitor and manage these risks are detailed below. Emerging risks Emerging risks are typified by having a high degree of uncertainty and may result from sudden events, new potential trends or changing specific risks where the impact and probable effect is hard to assess. As the assessment becomes clearer, the risk may be added to the risk matrix of ‘known’ risks. The Board is currently monitoring a number of emerging risks: geopolitical tension continues to be an emerging risk for the Company due to ongoing conflicts across the world. Along with increased populism and nationalism, these risks may impact individual economies and global markets. Although covered in the operational risk section above, the Board recognises the increased risk that cybercrime and the misuse of AI poses to the Company. Geopolitical events such as the conflicts in the Middle East region, coupled with the potential breakdown of post war alliances and potential new trade tariffs and changes to US economic and international policies introduced by President Trump, could bring uncertainty and fragility to capital markets in 2025, including persistent or reacceleration of inflationary pressures. Stakeholder Engagement – Section 172 Statement The Directors have a number of obligations including those under section 172 of the Companies Act 2006. These obligations relate to how the Board takes account of various factors in making its decisions – including the impact of its decisions on key stakeholders. The Board is focused on the Company’s performance and its responsibilities to stakeholders, corporate culture and diversity, as well as its contributions to wider society, and it takes account of stakeholder interests when making decisions on behalf of the Company. As an externally-managed investment trust, the Board considers the Company’s key stakeholders to be existing and potential new shareholders and its service providers. Full details on the primary ways in which the Board engaged with the Company’s key stakeholders can be found on pages 30 to 35 of the Annual Report. Dean BuckleyChair6 March 2025 Viability and Going Concern Statements Viability Statement The Board has assessed the prospects and viability of the Company beyond the 12 months required by the Going Concern accounting provisions. The Board considered the current position of the Company and its prospects, strategy and planning process as well as its principal and emerging risks in the current, medium and long term, as set out on pages 27 to 29 of the Annual Report. After the year-end but prior to approval of these Accounts, the Board reviewed its performance against its strategic objectives and its management of the principal and emerging risks facing the Company. The Board received regular updates on performance and other factors that could impact on the viability of the Company. The Board has concluded that there is a reasonable expectation that the Company will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due for at least the next five years; the Board expects this position to continue over many more years to come. The Company’s Investment Objective, which was approved by shareholders in April 2019, is to deliver a real return over the long term, through a combination of capital growth and a rising dividend, and the Board regards the Company’s shares as a long-term investment. The Board believes that a period of five years is considered a reasonable period for investment in equities and is appropriate for the composition of the Company’s portfolio. In arriving at this conclusion, the Board considered: Going Concern Statement In view of the conclusions drawn in the foregoing Viability Statements, which considered the resources of the Company over the next 12 months and beyond, the Directors believe that the Company has adequate financial resources to continue in existence for at least the period to 31 March 2026. Therefore, the Directors believe that it is appropriate to continue to adopt the Going Concern basis in preparing the financial statements. Directors’ Responsibilities The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the Financial Statements in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards and applicable law and regulations. Company law requires the Directors to prepare Financial Statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors are required to prepare the Financial Statements in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards. Under company law the Directors must not approve the Financial Statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss for that period. In preparing these Financial Statements, the Directors are required to: The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s transactions, and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that the Financial Statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. The Directors are responsible for ensuring that the Annual Report and Financial Statements, taken as a whole, are fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s position, performance, business model and strategy. Website publication The Directors are responsible for ensuring the Annual Report and the Financial Statements are made available on a website. Financial Statements are published on the Company’s website in accordance with legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of Financial Statements, which may vary from legislation in other jurisdictions. The maintenance and integrity of the Company’s website is the responsibility of the Directors. The Directors’ responsibility also extends to the ongoing integrity of the Financial Statements contained therein. Report of Directors and Responsibility Statement The Report of the Directors on pages 36 to 69 of the Annual Report (other than pages 61 to 63 which form part of the Strategic Report) of the Annual Report and Accounts has been approved by the Board. The Directors have chosen to include information relating to future development of the Company and relationships with suppliers, customers and others, and their impact on the Board’s decisions on pages 30 to 35 of the Annual Report. Each of the Directors, who are listed on pages 37 to 40 of the Annual Report, confirm to the best of their knowledge that: On behalf of the Board All revenue and capital items in the above statement derive from continuing operations. The ‘Total’ column of this statement is the profit and loss account of the Company and the ‘Revenue’ and ‘Capital’ columns represent supplementary information prepared under guidance issued by the Association of Investment Companies. The Company does not have any other comprehensive income and hence profit for the year, as disclosed above, is the same as the Company’s total comprehensive income. The £553.6m (2023: £574.6m) of unrealised capital reserve arising on the revaluation of investments is subject to fair value movements and may not be readily realisable at short notice, as such it may not be entirely distributable. The unrealised capital reserve includes unrealised gains on borrowings of £22.8m (2023: £5.5m) and gains on unquoted investments of £3.5m (2023: £nil) which are not distributable. The Financial Statements were approved by the Board of Directors and authorised for issue on 6 March 2025. They were signed on its behalf by: Jo DixonChair of the Audit and Risk Committee The financial information set out above does not constitute the Company's statutory Financial Statements for the years ended 31 December 2024 or 2023, but is derived from those Financial Statements. Statutory accounts for 2023 have been delivered to the Registrar of Companies and those for 2024 will be delivered following the Company's Annual General Meeting. The auditors have reported on those accounts; their reports were unqualified, did not draw attention to any matters by way of emphasis without qualifying their report and did not contain statements under s498(2) or (3) Companies Act 2006. The same accounting policies, presentations and methods of computation are followed in these Financial Statements as were applied in the Company’s last annual audited Financial Statements, other than those stated in the Annual Report. Basis of accounting The Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards (‘IASs’). The Financial Statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except that investments and fixed rate notes are stated at fair value through the profit and loss. The Association of Investment Companies (‘AIC’) issued a Statement of Recommended Practice: Financial Statements of Investment Companies (‘AIC SORP’) in July 2022. The Directors have sought to prepare the Financial Statements in accordance with the AIC SORP where the recommendations are consistent with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’). The Company qualifies as an investment entity. The Company has no securities in issue that could dilute the return per ordinary share. Therefore the basic and diluted earnings per ordinary share are the same. There are amounts of £1,222 (2023: £1,222) and £34,225 (2023: £34,225) owed to AT2006 and The Second Alliance Trust Limited, respectively, at year-end. There are no other related parties other than those noted below. Transactions with key management personnel Details of the Non-Executive Directors are disclosed on pages 37 to 40 of the Annual Report. For the purpose of IAS 24 ‘Related Party Disclosures’, key management personnel comprised the Non-Executive Directors of the Company.

Title: BlackRock’s Vivek Paul explains why India remains strong bet for global investors

BlackRock Investment Institute sees India as a key investment destination despite short-term market fluctuations. Vivek Paul of BlackRock, believes that India presents strong structural growth opportunities that make it a long-term winner."If we were thinking for anybody with an investing horizon 5, 10 years out, we would be building portfolios today using our core IP, where you would hold a greater allocation than a benchmark weight," Paul said in an ET Now interaction.BlackRock maintains an overweight position on both Indian equities and bonds, as the country's demographics and economic positioning remain favorable. Paul remains bullish on India’s economic potential and advises investors to allocate more than the benchmark weight to Indian markets."Structural opportunities are sizable in India. The demographic forces underpinning India are really strong, and the country’s multi-aligned geopolitical stance is likely to benefit it more in the future," said Paul. India is uniquely positioned to capitalize on global economic shifts, particularly in labor markets and geopolitics."Most of the developed markets and China, are going to experience a shortfall in the working age population over the coming 20 years. India is going to experience a big gain in the working age population in the coming years. And you think about the geopolitical dynamics that we are in now, a multi-aligned country such as India is likely to benefit from that sort of environmentt," Paul explained. While short-term economic cycles may create market fluctuations, India’s long-term fundamentals remain strong."We cannot assume that we will never see cyclical dynamics. Liquidity has been constrained, consumption is more challenged, and global uncertainty remains. But once these unwind, attention will shift back to fundamentals," Paul noted.Investors should differentiate between short-term volatility and long-term growth trends to make informed investment decisions. The debate on Indian market valuations continues, but Paul believes that India remains reasonably priced relative to its growth potential."If you think about risk premia associated with Indian stocks, I would argue that it is not particularly expensive in a historical context. Taking into account future earnings growth and different rate cycles, Indian equities remain attractive," Paul stated.While traditional valuation metrics may suggest high stock prices, expected earnings growth and interest rate trends justify India’s market positioning. Paul maintains his positive long-term outlook on India, advising investors to stay invested in large-cap equities and selective bond allocations."International investors will want to tap into India’s opportunities as the focus shifts back to fundamentals," he emphasized.Investors should focus on high-quality Indian stocks with strong earnings potential while maintaining exposure to the bond market for stable returns. Despite short-term market fluctuations, Vivek Paul sees India as a major growth driver for global portfolios."On a structural horizon, there is an opportunity in India. We see strong demographic forces, favorable geopolitical positioning, and long-term economic momentum supporting future growth," Paul said.Paul advises investors to stay invested for the long term, focus on structural growth over cyclical fluctuations, and view India as a key component of a globally diversified portfolio.(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

The deal was worth $22.8 billion and also involved a few dozen ports around the world. According to a Bloomberg report, it was the head of the banking giant who pitched the idea to the president. Citing unnamed sources familiar with the developments, Larry Fink offered Trump to buy the ports, whose Chinese-linked ownership had concerned the U.S. president. That concern happened to coincide with BlackRock’s ambition to expand globally in search of fresh profit opportunities and the perception that port ownership could present such an opportunity. The finance major paid $19 billion for the ports of Balboa and Cristobal to CK Hutchinson, which is owned by one of Asia’s wealthiest individuals, Hong Kong billionaire investor Li Ka-Shing. Along with the Panama ports, CK Hutchinson will also sell its controlling stakes in 43 other ports in 23 countries, the Wall Street Journal said, quoting an unnamed source close to the seller as saying, “It was a very elegant solution. Li does not like leaving things lingering.” Trump has had his sights on the Panama Canal ever since he won the November vote. “Has anyone ever heard of the Panama Canal?” Trump said in December. “Because we're being ripped off at the Panama Canal like we're being ripped off everywhere else.” “It was given to Panama and the people of Panama, but it has provisions,” the then president-elect went on to say of the Panama Canal. “If the principles, both moral and legal, of this magnanimous gesture of giving are not followed, then we will demand that the Panama Canal be returned to us, in full, quickly and without question.” Later, the president’s rhetoric toughened further, with him saying he would not exclude the use of force to reclaim U.S. control over the critical waterway that handles U.S. exports of liquefied natural gas to one of its key markets: Asia. The Panama Canal was built by the United States in the early 20th century. Panama granted the U.S. the right to build and operate the canal in exchange for annual payments. Ownership over the infrastructure was passed to the Panamanian government in 1977 by President Jimmy Carter. The deal granted control over the Panama Canal to the local government under the obligation of maintaining its neutrality. However, port ownership by a company with links to the Chinese government sparked concern about this neutrality in the new federal government, which is where BlackRock stepped in with a potential solution, according to media reports. Per Bloomberg, KKR and Blackstone were also bidders for the ports. The Panama Canal is the shortest route for U.S. LNG sold in Asia. However, it is not always the cheapest route or the fastest. The Canal authorities charge a fee for passage through the chokepoint, and weather conditions sometimes make it impossible to use it. That happened recently when a two-year drought made navigation through the Canal challenging and led to extended delays in goods delivery. Even so, the Panama Canal remains a key piece of infrastructure for U.S. energy exports, and there have even been discussions in recent years of boosting its capacity to handle an even greater volume of LNG exports. It is not without alternatives, however, which LNG exporters use whenever the economics of using the Panama Canal do not make sense.

NEXT | The Queue: I am a Negative Man The next phase of content for WoW Classic anniversary realms, Phase 3, will go live in game at 3PM pacific time on Thursday March 20, 2025. Phase 3 is actually being split in to two separate releases, with the second half scheduled to drop on Thursday April 3, 2025, also at 3PM pacific time. Based on the previous releases for anniversary realms, this means we can expect some downtime on Tuesday March 18 ahead of the phase rollout. Let’s take a look at what you can expect to go live with the Phase 3 update! March 20, 2025: April 3, 2025: Blackwing Lair is the headline PVE activity in Phase 3 but before players can take on this level 60 raid and the 8 bosses within, they’ll need to complete a short attunement questline that takes them through the Upper Blackrock Spire dungeon. Blackwing Lair rewards the highly sought after Tier 2 set pieces but if in order to complete their sets, players will also need to run Onyxia’s Lair for head pieces and Molten Core for leg pieces. The Darkmoon Faire will also appear in Elwynn Forest and Mulgore on March 20, with associated breadcrumb quests in Stormwind and Orgrimmar. Vendors for the Argent Dawn, Thorium Brotherhood, Timbermaw Hold, Silverwing Sentinels, and the Warsong Outriders will open up their inventories as a reward for progressing through their reputation tracks, allowing you to purchase certain gear, crafting recipes, and consumables. Alliance players will only be able to progress with Silvering Sentinels and the Warsong Outriders will only reward Horde players. Each class has an associated level 50 questline that rewards them with a unique rare-quality reward upon completion. These quests start in different zones based on your class but they all end at the Sunken Temple dungeon. Later, on April 3, the PVP Honor Rank will raise to 14 and the Arathi Basin battleground will open up for players above level 20. Players will also get a recurring battleground holiday event every weekend, running from Thursday at midnight (Friday) and lasting through Tuesday, presumably ending at reset. Each weekend will feature a different map and completing objectives in battlegrounds during this event will yield increased levels of Honor and Faction rewards. The first event is scheduled for April 4 in Arathi Basin. We’ll keep you updated on everything else coming to Classic anniversary realms once we learn about them!

Title: Dealmakers Head to New Orleans to Look Beyond ‘Havoc’ in M&A

(Bloomberg) -- Dealmakers gathered at an annual conference in New Orleans this week to catch their breath and try to look for reasons to be optimistic about a mergers and acquisitions market that has disappointed so far in 2025. “People want to do deals,” Audra Cohen, co-managing partner at law firm Sullivan & Cromwell’s general practice group, said during a presentation Thursday at Tulane University’s Corporate Law Institute event. She was speaking against a backdrop of falling deal values, with activity in part impacted by US President’s Donald Trump’s policies on the economy and foreign affairs. “Things like the tariffs give people a little bit of pause because they’re having to look at their business, at the supply chain and trying to figure out what that means,” Cohen said. “Until a little bit of this settles, it’s going to be challenging to get deals done particularly at valuations that people would expect.” Every year around this time, Wall Street’s clubby network of M&A lawyers, bankers and public relations professionals heads to Louisiana to talk shop at Tulane. Many dealmakers began 2025 expecting a banner year under Trump. But they’ve instead crashed into the harsh reality of trade wars and geopolitical clashes. “There’s a lack of predictability right now,” said Scott Barshay, chair of the corporate department at Paul Weiss Rifkind Wharton & Garrison. “Our clients are kind of waiting and seeing right now to see how things sort out. There’s a lot of interest in doing things.” Barshay said that the head of a company that was seeking to pursue a big transaction recently told him that the company plans to “wait a little while,” as it didn’t want to strike a deal only to see the market crater the next day. Barshay said he still expected the year to end on a positive note. “There’s just a little bit of a pause but I don’t think it’s a lot of pause,” he said. “I think we’re going to see over the next few weeks announcements of some bigger deals coming out.” ‘Wreaks Havoc’ Global deal values are down about 16% in 2025 to roughly $485 billion, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Jennifer Muller, co-head of Houlihan Lokey Inc.’s special committee advisory and fairness and solvency opinions practices, said it will be hard for values to hit the $3.5 trillion that many had expected this year. This week’s movement in the VIX Index, a closely watched measure of stock market volatility, is a worry, she said. “In order for M&A and IPOs to flourish, typically market volatility needs to stay below or around 20 on a consistent basis,” Muller said. “Most have predicted that Trump’s actions would create some enhanced volatility and indeed the VIX has been dancing around 20 and yesterday ended around 20. This wreaks havoc with M&A transactions.” Muller said she saw potential for a pickup in activity in deals around artificial intelligence, pharmaceuticals, financial services and oil and gas. Another wrinkle in the M&A market under Trump 2.0 is that the US government could want more of a say in negotiations around deals that it sees as having the potential to impact America’s competitiveness. This week, BlackRock Inc. led one of the biggest acquisitions of the year in a deal that marked both the firm’s expanded reach in infrastructure and a win for Trump, who had raised concerns over control of key ports near the Panama Canal. “Political leaders are getting into the deal process and [asking] for political concessions around the deal,” said Leo Strine Jr., of counsel in the corporate department at Wachtell Lipton Rosen & Katz. “That’s a new dynamic. If the US is going to involve itself in who does a deal, if the US government has a perspective on a cross-border deal, is the other government going to be involved?” More stories like this are available on bloomberg.com ©2025 Bloomberg L.P.

Title: Bitwise enters DeFi through institutional allocation with Maple Finance

Bitwise's investment through Maple Finance highlights the accelerating trend of institutions seeking attractive yields in DeFi markets. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Bitwise has taken a significant step into DeFi with its first institutional allocation through Maple Finance. This initiative will allow Bitwise to access on-chain credit while maintaining compliance with institutional regulatory standards on Maple’s platform. The firm, which manages over $12 billion in client assets, announced the move in a statement shared with CryptoSlate on March 6. Following the news, Maple Finance’s native SYRUP token increased by almost 10% to $0.145 as of press time. According to the statement, the development highlights the increasing demand for yield-generating opportunities in digital assets, particularly among institutional investors. The firm noted that its move signals a broader trend of institutions expanding beyond traditional fixed-income markets and exploring on-chain lending as a more efficient and scalable alternative. Jeff Park, Head of Alpha Strategies at Bitwise, emphasized the growing role of tokenization in institutional adoption. He noted that while many misuse terms like “tokenized securities” and “securitized tokens,” the latter is poised to drive real institutional adoption due to its practical benefits in the crypto ecosystem. Park added: “Private credit on crypto rails remains one of the most immediate opportunities for institutions who are looking to achieve high risk-adjusted yield with the additional benefits of liquidity, transparency, and efficiency that only DeFi can provide. With regulatory clarity that is being unleashed in D.C., it is now only a matter of time.” Meanwhile, the partnership between Bitwise and Maple Finance could pave the way for wider adoption of regulated on-chain lending platforms. Institutional investors are increasingly looking to credit markets as a source of alpha, and Maple’s growing track record positions it as a key player in this space. Nikolai Milutin, an ambassador for Maple, said the move shows that institutional adoption of on-chain credit is now underway. He added: “Bitwise has taken the first step by leveraging DeFi through Maple. This move signals a turning point—other institutions will follow, and it won’t be long before giants like Coinbase, Binance, and BLACKROCK take notice.” Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

Title: Shipping Giant MSC Set to Become World’s Largest Terminal Operator in $22.8B Hutchison Ports Deal

Essential news coupled with the finest maritime content sourced from across the globe. MSC ships at the Port of Long Beach. Photo courtesy Port of Long Beach In a landmark deal announced on Tuesday, Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison will sell its 80% stake in Hutchison Ports Holding to a Blackrock-TiL consortium, positioning Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC)—already the world’s largest ocean carrier by far—to become the global leader in container terminal operations, according to Drewry’s analysis of the deal. The $22.8 billion transaction, the largest ever in the global container terminal sector, comes amid heightened political scrutiny over Chinese influence in critical maritime infrastructure. Notably, the deal also includes the sale of Hutchison Port Holdings’ 90% interest in Panama Ports Company, which operates the Balboa and Cristobal ports on opposite ends of the Panama Canal. Since December, President Trump has repeatedly criticized alleged Chinese influence over Panama Canal operations and discriminatory practices against the U.S.—claims that the Panamanian government has firmly rejected. “My administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal, and we’ve already started doing it,” Trump said in his address to a joint session of Congress this week. “Just today, a large American company (BlackRock) announced they are buying both ports around the Panama Canal and lots of other things having to do with the Panama Canal and a couple of other canals.” Drewry’s global terminal operator (GTO) rankings show Hutchison Ports currently operates 43 maritime container terminals outside China and Hong Kong, spanning from Australia to the UAE, with a combined capacity exceeding 73 million TEU and throughput of nearly 47 million TEU as of 2023. MSC’s existing portfolio, which includes a 70% stake in Terminal Investment Limited (TiL), full ownership of Africa Global Logistics, and various Italian terminals through Marinvest, handled over 70 million TEU in 2023, according to Drewry. “The proposed deal will see MSC leapfrog other leading GTOs to secure the top spot in the global terminal operator rankings which Drewry produces each year, securing the Swiss-headquartered container carrier a truly global network of container terminals,” points out Eleanor Hadland, Drewry’s Lead Analyst for Ports and Terminals. However, regulatory hurdles may complicate the acquisition. Drewry’s analysis reveals key areas of concern include Panama, where TiL already holds significant interests opposite Hutchison’s operations; Rotterdam, where the deal could affect competition across Northwest Europe; and Spain, where both companies maintain substantial terminal presence. Drewry notes that the partnership leverages a longstanding relationship between MSC and Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), now owned by Blackrock. GIP’s initial 35% stake in TiL, acquired in 2013 and currently at 20%, has proven crucial for TiL’s expansion. “This deal appears to be a major win for MSC, which secures additional capacity in several key markets,” concludes Hadland. “We do however expect the regulatory processes to extend for at least a year, and foresee competition authorities taking a particular interest in the Northwest Europe, Spain and Panama markets.” Join the gCaptain Club for curated content, insider opinions, and vibrant community discussions.

The traditionalists wouldn’t have it any other way. Brian Walsh and James Browne scored a brace of tries each as Blackrock qualified to meet Terenure in the Leinster Schools Senior Cup final at Tallaght Stadium on St Patrick’s Day. Roscrea almost got the perfect start. Rob Carney made a strong carry, taking a number of would-be tacklers with him, but Sam Cusack couldn’t quite take the offload. Blackrock hit back straight away. Harry O’Neil and Michael O’Sullivan made dents but Aiden Vetjens was rattled by Keelan Dunne for a knock-on. No matter, ‘Rock props Ben Guerin and Sam Bishti straightened an attack. The ball found Johnny O’Sullivan knifing through for Paddy Clancy to convert in the 11th minute. From a scrum, the ‘Rock boys then moved wide for Johnny O’Sullivan to eat up metres. Brian Walsh took Geoff Wall’s flat ball for a try, converted by Clancy for 14-0 in the 15th minute. Still, Roscrea’s maul was starting to gather momentum and Eoin Naughton claimed a confidence-boosting try. Jack Deegan converted. When Johnny O’Sullivan made his next incursion, Albert Lindner looked a racing certainty to make the line until Sam Cusack caused a spill in the act of grounding. [ Michael Smyth grabs hat-trick as Terenure see off St Fintan’s to book final slotOpens in new window ] Nevertheless, the Williamstown school was slipping through the gears. Something had to give and it would be Roscrea’s fringe defence off a maul. Number eight Walsh peeled off for his second try, converted by Clancy for 21-7 at half-time. Roscrea, however, were not quite ready to accept their fate and Deegan kicked a penalty to narrow the deficit early in the second half. But ‘Rock stormed back and, following a Vetjens interception, Johnny O’Sullivan sent Browne over in the corner for 26-10 in the 39th minute. Roscrea still had an ace to play. A smooth lineout was moved to Deegan, whose venomous in-to-out movement ended beside the posts where he converted for 26-17 in the 50th minute. Another interception, by Bernard Whyte this time, put Blackrock back where they wanted to be deep in Roscrea territory. Fionn Carney prevented a try by Vetjens, but Bishti couldn’t be stopped. Clancy converted for 33-17 in the 65th minute. That was the ball game. There was still time for Michael O’Sullivan’s break and sound handling to see Browne into the right corner to clinch a day with destiny.

Title: Shipping Firms Pull Back from Hong Kong to Skirt US-China Risks

Essential news coupled with the finest maritime content sourced from across the globe. Port Of Hong Kong Stock Photo: leungchopan / Shutterstock.com HONG KONG/LONDON, March 6 (Reuters) – Some shipping companies are discreetly moving operations out of Hong Kong and taking vessels off its flag registry. Others are making contingency plans to do so. Behind these low-profile moves, six shipping executives said, lie concerns that their ships could be commandeered by Chinese authorities or hit with U.S. sanctions in a conflict between Beijing and Washington. Beijing’s emphasis on the role of Hong Kong in serving Chinese security interests and growing U.S. scrutiny of the importance of China’s commercial fleet in a possible military clash, such as over Taiwan, are causing unease across the industry, the people told Reuters. The U.S. Trade Representative’s office last month proposed levying steep U.S. port fees on Chinese shipping companies and others that operate Chinese-built vessels, to counter China’s “targeted dominance” of shipbuilding and maritime logistics. USTR’s $1.5M Port Fee Proposal on Chinese Ships Sparks Industry Confusion Over Critical Definitions Washington in September warned American businesses about growing risks of operating in Hong Kong, where the U.S. already applies sanctions against officials involved in a security crackdown. Hong Kong for more than a century has been a hub for shipowners and the brokers, financiers, underwriters and lawyers supporting them. Its maritime and port industry accounted for 4.2% of GDP in 2022, official data show. The city’s flag is the eighth most-flown by ships worldwide, according to VesselsValue, a subsidiary of maritime data group Veson Nautical. Reuters interviews with two dozen people, including shipping executives, insurers and lawyers familiar with Hong Kong, revealed growing concern that commercial maritime operations could be ensnared by forces beyond their control in a U.S.-China military clash. Many pointed to China’s intensified focus on national security objectives; trade frictions; and the broad powers of Hong Kong’s leader, who is accountable to Beijing, to seize control of shipping in an emergency. “We don’t want to be in a position where China comes knocking, wanting our ships, and the U.S. is targeting us on the other side,” said one executive, who like others was granted anonymity to discuss a sensitive issue. The concerns of shipowners and their actions to curb exposure to Hong Kong have not been previously reported. The perceptions of risk have grown in recent years, coinciding with a tightening security climate in the Chinese-ruled city and tensions between the world’s two largest economies. Commercial ships must be registered, or flagged, with a particular country or jurisdiction to comply with safety and environmental rules. Despite an influx of Chinese-operated ships onto Hong Kong’s registry, the number of oceangoing vessels flagged in the city fell more than 8% to 2,366 in January from 2,580 four years earlier, according to independent analysis by VesselsValue. Government data show a similar drop. Among the ships that left Hong Kong’s registry, 74 re-flagged to Singapore and Marshall Islands in 2023 and 2024, chiefly dry-bulk carriers designed to transport commodities such as coal, iron ore and grain. Some 15 tankers and seven container ships separately left the Hong Kong registry for those flags, according to VesselsValue. The outflow of ships since 2021 marks a reversal for Hong Kong’s registry, which official data show grew roughly 400% in two decades following 1997. In response to Reuters questions, Hong Kong’s government said it was natural for shipping companies to review operations given changing geopolitical and trade circumstances, and normal for the number of ships on registries to fluctuate in the short term. Hong Kong would “continue to excel as a prominent international shipping centre”, a spokesperson said, outlining a range of incentives for shipowners, including profits tax breaks and green subsidies. Neither the laws governing the registry nor emergency provisions empowered Hong Kong’s leader to commandeer ships to serve in a Chinese merchant fleet, the spokesperson said. The spokesperson declined to elaborate when asked about industry players’ concerns over how colonial-era emergency powers might be applied during a U.S.-China conflict. The provisions allow the city’s leader to make “any regulations whatsoever”, including taking control of vessels and property. China’s defence and commerce ministries didn’t respond to questions about the role of a merchant fleet in Beijing’s warfighting plans, the potential involvement of Hong Kong-flagged vessels, and the worries of commercial shipowners. The U.S. Treasury and Pentagon declined to comment about potential sanctions, shipping executives’ concerns, and the role of Hong Kong-registered vessels in a Chinese merchant fleet. Lawyers and executives say ships can be re-flagged for various reasons through sale, charter or redeployment to different routes. Basil Karatzas, U.S.-based consultant with Karatzas Marine Advisors & Co, said Singapore had become the preferred domicile for companies with lesser exposure to Chinese shipping and cargo trade, because it offered many efficiencies, including its legal system, but less risk than Hong Kong. Singapore’s Maritime and Port Authority said decisions about domiciles and flagging were based on commercial considerations. It had not observed any “significant change” in the number of Hong Kong-based shipping companies relocating operations or re-flagging vessels to Singapore. Hong Kong’s shipping registry is widely regarded for its safety and regulatory standards, executives and lawyers say, allowing its ships to pass easily through foreign ports. Hong Kong’s flag is now flown by many of China’s state-owned international vessels. In a conflict, these tankers, bulk carriers and large container vessels would form the backbone of a merchant fleet serving the People’s Liberation Army to supply China’s oil, food and industrial needs, according to four security analysts and PLA military studies. By contrast, the U.S. has a small commercial shipbuilding industry and far fewer ships under its flag. While China’s state-owned fleet is growing in size, it would be a target for the U.S. in a military clash, and Beijing would likely require other vessels to ensure supplies given its vast needs and reliance on international sea lanes, three analysts said. Strategic maritime operations have surfaced on President Donald Trump’s radar. In his inauguration speech in January, Trump threatened to “take back” the Panama Canal, which he said had fallen under Chinese control. He did not give specifics, but Trump’s remarks focused attention on two Panama ports operated by a subsidiary of Hong Kong conglomerate CK Hutchison Holdings 0001.HK. The group, which didn’t respond to questions about Trump’s comments, agreed this week to sell a majority stake in the subsidiary to a consortium of investors led by BlackRock BLK.N, giving U.S. interests control over the ports. Trump told Congress on Tuesday that his administration will create an office of shipbuilding in the White House and offer new tax incentives for the sector. A U.S. congressional study in November 2023 stated that “cargo ships typically transport 90% of the military equipment needed in overseas wars”. It noted that Chinese shipyards had 1,794 large oceangoing ships on order in 2022, compared with five in the U.S. Merchant vessels were vital in Britain’s long-range mission to retake the Falkland Islands from Argentina in 1982. And UK-flagged commercial ships operating out of Hong Kong – many owned by local firms dependent on or controlled by China – supplied communist Hanoi during the Vietnam War, frustrating the U.S., declassified CIA documents show. The need for a strong Chinese merchant fleet to help build China’s maritime power was outlined by President Xi Jinping in a Politburo study session in 2013. Over the last decade, Chinese government and military documents and studies have highlighted the dual-use military value of China’s merchant ships. Regulations enacted in 2015 required Chinese builders of five types of commercial vessels – including tankers, container ships and bulk carriers – to ensure they could serve military needs, according to state media. Since then, the state-owned COSCO line has grown significantly. Public COSCO documents show China is placing political commissars – officers who ensure Communist Party goals are ultimately served – on nominally civilian ships. In January, the U.S. blacklisted COSCO subsidiaries for what it said were links to the Chinese military. COSCO did not respond to questions about its deployment of commissars, the U.S. restrictions and what role the company’s ships, including Hong Kong-flagged ones, might play in a wartime scenario. Hong Kong remains an important base for shipowners, despite the geopolitical challenges. But some are quietly hedging their bets. One company founded in Hong Kong in 2014, London-listed Taylor Maritime TMI.L, now has a smaller presence in Hong Kong after making several strategic moves over the past few years. Since 2021, it has kept its ships flagged in the Marshall Islands and Singapore. Its offices are in London, Guernsey, Singapore, Hong Kong and Durban. The firm “really de-risked Hong Kong”, said a person familiar with the matter, citing investors’ concerns about a Chinese invasion of Taiwan and the Communist Party’s increasing control of Hong Kong. A Taylor Maritime spokesperson said that initially, the company moved its Asia-based commercial teams to Singapore from Hong Kong to be closer to clients. With its acquisition of shipping company Grindrod, which had its Asia office in Singapore, Taylor Maritime expanded its operation there and relocated some functions from Hong Kong, to the point where Singapore became its primary Asia hub, the spokesperson added. Hong Kong-listed Pacific Basin Shipping 2343.HK has traditionally flagged its 110-strong fleet of bulk carriers in Hong Kong but is drafting contingency plans to register them elsewhere as it gauges potential risks, said two people familiar with the matter. A Pacific Basin spokesperson said the company was constantly evaluating geopolitical risks but that its fleet was still flying the Hong Kong flag, “which at least for now outweigh(s) the challenges”. “Being in Hong Kong positions us close to China’s 40% share of global dry bulk import/export activity and close to Asia’s strong economic and industrial growth regions,” the spokesperson said. Angad Banga, chairman of the Hong Kong Shipowners Association, said shipping firms adjusted contingency plans based on risk assessments in a complex geopolitical environment but he had not encountered concerns about the commandeering of vessels. “While some may be reviewing operational strategies, we as an organisation do not to see any widespread exodus or loss of confidence in Hong Kong,” Banga told Reuters, adding that the city remained attractive for maritime commerce. Yet some industry figures described a broad unease about Hong Kong that was affecting their planning. Three lawyers said that until recent years, contracts hammered out for the growing number of ships built in China and financed by Chinese banks typically stipulated that they must fly the Hong Kong flag. But over the last two years, some have included a caveat demanded by owners to provide flexibility: a few other prominent flags are listed as options alongside Hong Kong, the lawyers said. Reuters could not independently verify the changes. Beyond China’s military modernisation and its refusal to renounce the use of force to seize Taiwan, Beijing officials have stressed the importance of Hong Kong in fulfilling national security priorities. Three executives and two lawyers told Reuters that sweeping security legislation, first imposed on Hong Kong in July 2020 and strengthened in March 2024, had added to the dangers. The lawyers said any move by Hong Kong’s leader to commandeer vessels in an emergency might prove difficult in practice, as locally registered ships often plied routes far from Hong Kong. But such long-standing powers now had to be viewed through a national security lens, they said. Some shipowners wouldn’t object to an official request to turn over their vessels, either out of patriotism or the potential to profit from a crisis, one lawyer said. But “it is better not to be in a position where you might even be asked”, said another veteran lawyer. “It was not an issue just a few years ago, in what is clearly a redrawn national security map.” (Reporting by Greg Torode and Jonathan Saul; additional reporting by Andrea Shalal and Idrees Ali in Washington, and the Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong newsrooms; editing by David Crawshaw) (c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2025.

Title: As Trump Hails Taking Back of Panama Canal, Hong Kong Inc Walks Tightrope

Essential news coupled with the finest maritime content sourced from across the globe. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio tours the Miraflores locks at the Panama Canal in Panama City, Feb. 2, 2025. Mark Schiefelbein/Pool via REUTERS HONG KONG, March 6 (Reuters) – Hong Kong‘s edge as a financial hub will erode further as the city becomes embroiled in China-U.S. tensions, with the flash sale of a Hong Kong-owned global ports business highlighting geopolitical volatility, executives and analysts said. The former British colony is caught in the eye of a storm between Beijing and Washington, underlined by the decision by conglomerate CK Hutchison, controlled by Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing, to sell its ports network, including assets along the Panama Canal, to a U.S. consortium led by BlackRock. U.S. President Donald Trump, who claimed in January that the Panama Canal was being operated by a Chinese company, has hailed the deal. “The Trump administration is going to see that this worked…and you have to assume they’re going to follow the same play book…(they) see this as a victory,” Steven Okun, a senior adviser to financial and risk advisory Kroll, told Reuters. As the U.S. strives to contain its main global rival China on fronts including trade, shipping, technology and capital raising, a dozen business people, investors, lawyers, shipping executives and risk analysts who spoke to Reuters say this is bringing greater uncertainty and volatility to Hong Kong. Hong Kong firms have traditionally been seen as internationally-focused and independent of the Chinese state, reflecting the role of the former British colony as a freewheeling financial hub. “We have been constantly reviewing our business plan and discussing about our strategy because of the political tension,” said an executive of a listed Hong Kong company who declined to be named given the sensitivity of the topic. “For example, do we still want to list our units in Hong Kong and is Hong Kong still attractive as a listing venue, because investors could draw a China connection,” he told Reuters. Hong Kong has a separate rule of law from China and its own financial policy-making autonomy, but some lawyers, diplomats and business executives say that after China’s imposition of a national security law in 2020, the city was essentially being viewed by the West as fully under the control of Beijing. This has hurt it economically and cast doubt on whether it is a jurisdiction separate from mainland China with global best practices, they said. Earlier this year, Hong Kong’s Far East Consortium and Chow Tai Fook Enterprise, which owns a development with Star Entertainment, the embattled casino group in Brisbane, tried to buy Star out. If successful, the bid will be another test of regulators who view Hong Kong companies as Chinese. In 2018, Australia blocked a A$13 billion ($8.2 billion) takeover of the country’s biggest gas pipeline company, APA Group APA.AX, by CK Infrastructure, a unit of CK Hutchison, citing it would be against the national interest. “Hong Kong is being increasingly lumped in with China … that’s a fact,” said a board member of a leading Hong Kong business family with interests locally and overseas, including retail and property. “To a degree, this has raised the complexity and cost in our business dealings. We have to live with this.” According to a person with knowledge of the matter, CK Hutchison had initially tried to fight to keep its two main port businesses in Panama after Trump alleged the Panama Canal was under Chinese control. But later, Hutchison opted to cash out and mitigate longer term reputational risks. “People in the Hutch empire are running for cover,” said the person with knowledge of the ports negotiations, who declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the issue. “This is a nightmare situation and we’ve never dealt with anything like this before.” This source added that CK Hutchison executives were in touch with officials in Beijing while the situation unfolded. CK Hutchison did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Co-managing director Frank Sixt said in a statement this week the ports transaction was “unrelated to recent political news reports.” The Hong Kong government has said it has never interfered with the commercial operations of Hong Kong companies, and criticized U.S. officials for making what it said were unreasonable and distorted accusations regarding the operation of the Panama Canal. “It’s been politicized and weaponised,” a senior Chinese government official said of the Trump administration’s framing of Hutchison as a Chinese entity – something the firm has denied. “It’s unfortunate and regrettable,” the official told Reuters, declining to be identified. Others, including business executives and lawyers, agreed that Hong Kong is increasingly being viewed as similar to other Chinese cities, even though officials like the territory’s financial secretary, Paul Chan, say the city remains a global hub for the free flow of capital, goods and people. “The market is based on expectations,” said Vera Yuen, an economics lecturer with the University of Hong Kong business school. “The valuation (of Hong Kong) is based on what they (the world) think, not what you claim.” Even ahead of the recent Trump administration pressure on Hutchison’s Panama ports, some local firms with international reach had been drawing up contingency plans to deal with growing U.S.-China strategic rivalry – and a growing sense Hong Kong would be in the crosshairs in a conflict. In 2023, Hong Kong-based conglomerate Swire Pacific sold its Swire Coca-Cola USA unit to its controlling shareholder, John Swire & Sons Ltd headquartered in the U.K., to protect the business so that it would no longer be seen as being held by a “Chinese company,” two sources with knowledge of the matter said. A Hong Kong shipping firm executive described how his operation was already presenting its international posture in meetings with foreign investors. “The key is being as international as we can – our offices, domiciles and ships,” the executive said. “We want to be able to show we are not really based anywhere.” ($1 = 1.5780 Australian dollars) (Additional reporting by Greg Torode and Jessie Pang in Hong Kong; Scott Murdoch in Sydney and Beijing Newsroom; Writing by James Pomfret; Editing by Raju Gopalakrishnan) (c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2025.

This group brings together the best thinkers on energy and climate. Join us for smart, insightful posts and conversations about where the energy industry is and where it is going. Video Llewellyn King is the creator, executive producer and host of “White House Chronicle,” a weekly news and public affairs program, airing nationwide on PBS and public, educational and government... Video recording of the session at the bottom of this post, along with open Q&A discussion from the session taking place actively on the Energy Central Community: Lee Zeldin, new Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, has said, “It’s important for us urgently to do everything in our power to make sure Americans have the cleanest air, land, and water. That’s something that keeps me up at night." Environmentalists and many in the energy sector believe the Trump administration is doing just the opposite. It has taken aim at a raft of laws and regulations which protect the environment, including the National Environmental Policy Act, bulwark of a vast structure of environmental laws and protections since it was signed into law by President Nixon in 1970. There is alarm in the utility industry about the administration’s antipathy to wind generation. Its enthusiasm for coal alarms clean air advocates who see it as a step backward. There also is alarm about the future of transitional funding guaranteed during the Biden administration, under the Inflation Reduction Act, to enhance clean energy and finance transition from polluting fuels to green ones. That funding is frozen and the Department of Government Efficiency operatives have slashed employment in the Department of Energy’s loan office. What now? The rural electric cooperatives are worried about $9 billion in financing they were to get from the Department of Agriculture for rural electrification projects. Lesser laws like the Endangered Species Act, it is feared by their defenders, may be repealed or circumvented. The United States Energy Association at its most recent virtual press briefing, conducted on March 5, examined what to expect from the Trump administration in its reshaping of environmental policy, and the nature and scope of the legal opposition. Court challenges have already been filed and many more are expected. As usual, a panel of experts were questioned by a panel of senior journalists who cover energy and the environment. Journalist Llewellyn King organized and moderated the press briefings, which are broadcast live on Zoom and last an hour. Mark Menezes gave welcoming remarks and was on hand to share his deep knowledge as president and CEO of USEA and as a former deputy secretary of energy.

Title: World beginning to tire of whiplash leadership...
URL: https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/06/politics/trump-canada-mexico-tariffs-whiplash-analysis/index.html
Time Published: 2025-03-06T15:00:03Z

Follow: Government by chaos is back. One day, President Donald Trump imposed a punishing tariff regime against Canada and Mexico. The next, he froze auto duties for a month after suddenly realizing that – as everyone had predicted – they could wreck a quintessential American industry. Last week, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky came to the Oval Office to sign a rare-earth minerals deal that Trump billed as a triumph for the US. But Zelensky was provoked by Vice President JD Vance and kicked out of the White House. European leaders have spent days trying to fix the debacle. Elon Musk, meanwhile, is taking his chainsaw to the bureaucracy, indiscriminately firing workers and feeding agencies into the wood chipper – pitching citizens and industries who rely on government payments into uncertainty just as the economy softens and is more vulnerable to such shocks. At first, Trump’s early-term energy on multiple fronts was a bolt of energy as he scratched his Sharpie across executive orders and chased away the lethargy that marked President Joe Biden’s waning months in office. Six weeks in, however, as Trump makes gut-check calls to dismantle post-Cold War national security arrangements, the global free trade system, and the federal machine – all of which helped make the US a superpower – a new realization is dawning. There doesn’t seem to be a plan. Trump’s haphazard efforts to make peace in Ukraine, revive Rust Belt-heavy industry with 19th century-style tariffs and slash government are as improvisational as the “weave” – his name for his stream-of-consciousness campaign screeds. And the world is once again left hanging on the “America first” president’s whims and obsessions. “There’s too much unpredictability and chaos coming out of the White House right now,” Canadian Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly said Wednesday, describing US trade policy as a “psychodrama” her country can’t go through every 30 days. America’s friends are often left to puzzle over what exactly Trump is trying to do. The president, for instance, said Wednesday that Canada hadn’t done enough to stem the flow of fentanyl over the border – but only minuscule amounts of the drug are involved. Sometimes the White House complains about the flow south of undocumented migrants – but these numbers are also small. Trump also wants manufacturing to leave Canada and move south. No wonder some officials in Ottawa have concluded he’s trying to weaken their country to make it easier to annex. Still, the president can point to some successes with his threat-based foreign policy. For instance, his fury that a Hong Kong-based firm owned two ports at either end of the Panama Canal is precipitating a purchase by US investment giant BlackRock. The president had falsely claimed these ports meant China controlled the vital waterway built by the US, but the change of ownership may still improve the US strategic position. And Trump might be downgrading the transatlantic alliance that has kept world peace for 80 years – but he’s set off an unprecedented rearmament program among NATO allies that other presidents have demanded for years. But just as often, it’s as if Trump is more interested in brute force personal power than working off any long-term playbook. Michael Froman, a former US trade representative who chairs the Council on Foreign Relations, told Jim Sciutto on CNN International Wednesday that while the cost of imposing tariffs often outweighs the benefits, they can be a tool that gets other nations to the negotiating table. This is true in the case of Mexico with which the US has far wider border issues than Canada. But, Froman added, “you have to know what it is you want them to do for that leverage to be useful.” To some extent, the chaos is the point. And the theatrics of a president addicted to stunt politics are key to his political appeal. But allied governments have their own politics to worry about – a factor the Trump administration often seems to ignore. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum – who is, like Trump, new in office and keen to make a mark – said Wednesday that her country could consider alternative trade partners to the United States “if necessary.” On Tuesday, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer pointedly paid tribute in the House of Commons to British soldiers who were killed fighting alongside the United States in Iraq and Afghanistan. This followed a comment by Vance on Fox News that Ukraine needed better security guarantees than undertakings from “some random country that has not fought a war in 30 or 40 years.” The vice president’s remark caused great offensive in Britain. He said on X that claims he’d been talking about Britain and France were “absurdly dishonest,” but those are the only allies who have so far publicly volunteered to take part in a post-peace deal reassurance force in Ukraine. And French President Emmanuel Macron warned his compatriots Wednesday evening the world had changed utterly since Trump returned to the White House, adding that he was considering extending the protection of France’s nuclear arsenal to European allies. For some MAGA supporters, Trump’s genius for enraging Democrats, the media and foreign governments is an end in itself. And for ideologues on the populist nationalist right, sparking pandemonium in Washington and destroying governing agencies is a way of deconstructing the administrative state. Trump’s method was honed in his office high up in the skyscraper that bears his name in Manhattan. The future president learned through his real estate career how to push opponents off balance with outlandish demands, verbal confrontations and sudden switches of position. In government, he does the same thing to disorientate adversaries and seeks to impose power amid the mayhem. But while unpredictability is a real estate superpower, it’s a liability when running a country, an economy and a planet – where continuity and predictability are preferred. “It’s just constant, and it’s exhausting,” said Julian Vikan Karaguesian, a former Canadian Ministry of Finance official, referring to Trump’s scorched-earth tariff offensive. “It’s almost surreal. Is it real? Is it going to be real this time?” Karaguesian, who now lectures at McGill University in Montreal, added: “Maybe the modus operandi here is uncertainty. It’s not tariffs, it’s not anything else, but intentionally creating a sense of chaos and a sense of uncertainty.” The auto tariffs that the president froze for a month on Wednesday, a day after imposing blanket 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico, shows how he sometimes has second thoughts about his own aggression. Perhaps his favorite barometer, the stock market, forced his hand. His concession reversed two days of steep losses on the Dow Jones Industrial Average with a handy near-500-point rebound. CNN reported Wednesday that Trump relented after conversations with the CEOs of the Big Three automakers. And his press secretary Karoline Leavitt said he was open to “hearing about additional exemptions.” The idea that well-placed CEOs can use their access to the powerful to acquire exemptions and special favors not available to ordinary Americans is the antithesis of an equitable economy. But then Trump has shown little respect for rules-based systems that eliminate the kind of patronage and potential for corruption that thrives in autocratic societies. Trump’s approach may also mean he likes threatening tariffs more than imposing them. But by constantly threatening tariffs and then creating doubt about whether or when they will be maintained, the president is causing huge uncertainty for businesses that need to establish certainty of costs and supply and consumers who could damage an already-softening economy if they rein in spending. “There’s so much uncertainty about what the administration is doing that the mere prospect of tariffs is creating a big anchor on the economy,” Bharat Ramamurti, former deputy director of Biden’s National Economic Council, told reporters on a conference call Monday. “The prospect of significant tariffs on our allies has resulted in withholding investments and preemptive price increases that are going to be borne by small businesses and, ultimately, by consumers.” Trump’s relentless bullying of America’s friends – while seemingly doing everything he can to advance its traditional adversary Russia in Ukraine – may also drain US power in the long run. “What we have seen this week is that the dollar has suffered a very sharp decline,” Ruchir Sharma, founder and chief investment officer of Breakout Capital, told Richard Quest on CNN International. “It’s revealing that the rest of the world is getting its act together … and I think investors are beginning to notice there are other countries worth investing in, given all this policy volatility that is emerging in the US,” he said. The danger for the US therefore is that four more years of Trump’s antics could reshape the globe – in a way that does not comply with his vision of US dominance but leaves Americans looking in from the outside. Mexico and Canada, for instance, can’t change the geography that makes it a no-brainer to trade with the mighty US. But both also may see advantages in expanding trade and investment with America’s rising rival China. And the European Union, which is expecting its own barrage of Trump tariffs soon, may examine similar horizons. America’s Western allies have too much invested in generations with ties with Washington to want it to fail. But they have their own national interests too. Canada can’t win a trade war against its more powerful neighbor. But its patience is thin over Trump’s brinkmanship and bullying. Doug Ford, the premier of Ontario, home to Canada’s largest provincial economy, says the only way forward is for Trump to eradicate all tariffs rather than an a la carte easing of duties industry by industry, as with autos. “All this gives us is uncertainty again,” Ford told CNN’s Phil Mattingly on Wednesday. “There is one person that’s causing that problem today: that’s President Trump.” © 2025 Cable News Network.

Title: How a falling dollar index [DXY] can push Bitcoin to $100,000

Time Published: 2025-03-06T13:45:06Z
Full Content:
The dollar index is having a positive effect on BTC. In the last 24 hours, Bitcoin [BTC] has seen a gradual price increase, crossing back into the $90,000 region. It was around $92,500 as of this writing, following a 6.12% gain. This recent accumulation is driven by the Dollar Index losing strength and investors gradually building buying momentum. If sentiment continues to grow, the asset is likely to see a major push to the upside and cross above the $100,000 region. There has been a decline in the U.S. Dollar Index [DXY], which measures the strength of the dollar against a basket of six commodities. Historically, a weakening dollar index tends to benefit cryptocurrencies like BTC and altcoins. In the last two market cycles—2017 and 2021—BTC gained ground and saw major market moves following a decline in the dollar index. A similar trend was observed with altcoins, which experienced significant gains, as seen in the chart below. Source: X If key levels hold as indicated and the DXY chart follows the pattern of the past two cycles, the cryptocurrency market, particularly BTC, could gain an edge for an upswing. The amount of Bitcoin sold in the spot market over the past 24 hours has begun to decline. As of the time of writing, BTC sales totaled $163.54 million on the 5th of March but have since dropped to $87.12 million. If this trend continues, it is more likely that investors will begin accumulating again, leading to increased exchange net inflows. Similarly, the fund market premium—which measures whether investors are buying or selling based on whether it is above or below zero—was at 0.2 at press time, indicating buying activity. Source: CryptoQuant However, a closer look at the chart shows that the fund market premium has remained at a similar level since March began, moving along a steady line. This suggests that investors are likely accumulating BTC in anticipation of a major upward move. After days of consistent market outflows from the Bitcoin exchange-traded funds [ETF] market—indicating institutional investors are selling BTC—the sentiment is shifting. BlackRock, a notable institutional investor with over $50 billion in BTC ETF via IBIT, has stopped selling. When selling slows or halts, it often signals that investors are reassessing their positions and may soon resume buying, especially in a bullish environment. At the time of writing, BTC ETFs recorded an inflow of $22 million in the past 24 hours, indicating renewed interest among institutional investors.

A biotech company’s new therapy has done something remarkable: help children who were born blind to see for the first time. Publicly-traded MeiraGTx has developed targeted gene therapy methods to treat genetic disorders, like one that degrades the retina, impacting hundreds of children born each year. But the company isn’t just working on eye-related disorders: It has its sights set on treating Parkinson’s. Zandy Forbes, an alumna of Forbes 50 Over 50 who is not related to the Forbes family, started MeiraGTx in 2015. In the first nine months of 2024, the biotech firm reported about $12 million in revenue, and Forbes expects that to increase when its first therapy is approved by regulators. Dodge vehicles parked outside a dealership in Edmonton, Canada, last month. President Donald Trump exempted U.S. automakers from the 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports for one month, as the import taxes are expected to drive up the price of new cars by thousands of dollars. Trump Administration officials reportedly met with the three biggest U.S. carmakers—Ford, General Motors and Chrysler parent Stellantis—on Tuesday.

Trump said in his address to Congress on Tuesday that he wants to “bring down mortgage rates,” but significant decreases often come at times of economic distress. CEOs are often critical of short sellers, who profit from a company’s downfall. But they’re not putting their money where their mouth is: A new study from researchers at the University of Kansas and Appalachian State University found that executives claiming their stock is being hammered by short sellers are more likely to be selling their own shares. Tennessee mogul Forrest Preston ran Life Care Centers of America, America’s largest privately-held nursing home chain, for more than five decades, but this week, a court found the 91-year-old to be unfit to lead the $3 billion business. His son Aubrey, who first alleged that Forrest was being abused and robbed by his much younger wife and former caregiver, was named his father’s permanent conservator, and has taken control of the company.

On Scale AI’s platform Outlier, freelancers complete paid tasks to train generative AI models for Scale’s corporate customers, which include Google, Meta and OpenAI. The company said the fastest-growing segment of its contributors on Outlier over the last year are workers in the U.S. A Hong Kong-based conglomerate controlled by billionaire Li Ka-shing has agreed to sell a majority stake in its Panama Canal ports to a consortium led by BlackRock, as President Donald Trump has criticized what he sees as Chinese influence over the waterway critical to global trade. The deal is worth $22.8 billion and would earn cash proceeds of more than $19 billion for CK Hutchison Holdings, whose business operations span ports, retail, infrastructure and telecommunications across the globe. Before Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump were announced as board members of Dominari Holdings Inc., trading in the firm soared, and the boost has raised the suspicions of some securities law experts. In all of 2024, Dominari Holdings’ trading volume was 3.2 million, just one-seventh of its volume on February 10, the day before the Trumps’ involvement was announced. Actor, composer Lin-Manuel Miranda is seen on stage during a "Hamilton" GRAMMY performance. The hit musical Hamilton is canceling its 2026 dates at the Kennedy Center in protest of President Donald Trump, who took over as the center’s chair last month and fired board members. The musical will soon announce an alternative venue for the shows in the Washington area, the New York Times reported. China escalated its threats of retaliation after President Donald Trump levied an additional 10% tariff on Chinese imports to the U.S. on Tuesday. “If war is what the U.S. wants, be it a tariff war, a trade war or any other type of war, we’re ready to fight till the end,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said. The White House is directly negotiating with Hamas for the release of the remaining U.S. hostages and a permanent end to the conflict in Gaza, breaking its long-standing precedent against negotiating directly with Foreign Terrorist Organizations. But in a post on Truth Social on Wednesday, Trump gave a “last warning” to Hamas, telling the militant group to free all remaining hostages and saying “not a single Hamas member will be safe if you don’t do as I say.” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Thursday that a Russian “ballistic missile” struck a hotel housing American and British volunteers in the city of Kryvyi Rih. In a social media post, Zelenskyy wrote that Ukrainian authorities were carrying out an “all night rescue mission” after the attack, which killed four people—though the U.S. and U.K. nationals managed to escape.

President Donald Trump and Elon Musk watch the launch of the sixth test flight of the SpaceX Starship rocket on November 19. TOPLINE Across the U.S., a web of ancient copper wires connect airport control towers to radars and weather observation stations, helping air traffic controllers communicate and get the data they need to make sure planes get where they’re supposed to go safely. But this decades-old system is starting to fail. Airports have been forced to ground planes due to telecommunications failures. Now, after a series of near misses and a shocking midair collision in Washington, D.C. that killed 67 people, the pressure is on the Trump Administration to address rising public fear over air safety. Help is on the way, newly minted Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy reassured the public a week after the disaster. Elon Musk and SpaceX were stepping in. The billionaire’s company reportedly may be tapped for a crash upgrade of the FAA’s telecom system, never mind that it didn’t play a role in the Washington disaster. And never mind that Verizon already has a $2.4 billion, 15-year contract to replace all that copper wire with lightning-fast fiber-optic cables. A SpaceX engineer tasked to the FAA told agency staffers that Musk himself had directed that they deploy thousands of the company’s Starlink satellite internet terminals, according to Bloomberg. WHY IT MATTERS That creates obvious and serious conflicts of interests, with Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency currently burrowing into the agency that acts as SpaceX’s primary regulator. But worse, it makes no sense, writes Forbes’ Jeremy Bogaisky. Starlink may be suitable to connect remote FAA facilities, but it doesn’t currently have the bandwidth or reliability to serve as the backbone of the agency’s nationwide communications network. Plus, SpaceX has no apparent experience in serving as a prime contractor for a solution incorporating a mix of communications technologies. The turmoil could end up delaying a badly needed modernization project. MORE For The Army, The D.C.

We rely on your support for our independence, diversity and quality. Germany’s recent election results highlight deepening political fractures, with the rise of the far-right Alternate for Deutschland and the weakening of the center-left Social Democratic Party. Economic struggles and immigration concerns have fueled AfD’s support, especially in former East Germany. This instability could undermine Germany’s leadership in Europe, leaving the continent vulnerable. This article saved into your bookmarks. Click here to view your bookmarks. Germany’s recent election results have brought to the forefront the deepening fractures within the nation’s politics and society. The election showcased a significant shift in the political landscape, with the rise of the Alternative for Germany (AfD), a far-right party that has gained considerable support, particularly in the former East German territories. This, in conjunction with a weakening of the center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD) and a fragmented political environment, reveals the complexities Germany faces in its efforts to govern effectively. A divided political landscape The election results underscored the ongoing fragmentation of Germany’s political system. The SPD, led by Chancellor Olaf Scholz, saw a significant decline, securing only 16.4% of the vote. While this result was expected due to the party’s struggles in recent years, it has led to a situation where the SPD has lost much of its influence in shaping the nation’s future. On the other hand, the Christian Democrats (CDU/CSU), while victorious, achieved only 28.6% of the vote. This result demonstrates that even the center-right, long the dominant force in German politics, is no longer able to secure a decisive win without relying on coalitions. The rise of the AfD, which secured 20.8% of the vote, is perhaps the most striking outcome of this election. Although their support is still strongest in the former East Germany, where they garnered 29.7% of the vote, the AfD is beginning to make inroads into the West, achieving 13% of the vote in regions that were once firmly supportive of the CDU/CSU. This growing influence of the AfD highlights the increasing polarization of German politics and society, driven in part by economic insecurity, immigration concerns and the cultural tensions surrounding globalization. In addition to the rise of the AfD, the election results also revealed the diminished strength of the SPD, the Greens and the Free Democratic Party (FDP). These parties, which had formed the previous traffic light coalition government, struggled to present a unified front. The fractious nature of this coalition led to inefficiencies in governance and left the electorate dissatisfied. The lack of progress on key issues such as inflation, immigration and economic reform contributed to the overall sense of disillusionment with the current political establishment. The roots of AfD support: economic struggles and immigration concerns The AfD’s strong performance can be attributed to a combination of factors, with two key issues standing out: economic discontent and concerns over immigration. Germany’s economy has struggled in recent years, with no GDP growth for several consecutive years. The country has faced multiple crises, from the effects of the Russia–Ukraine war to challenges stemming from global inflation. These economic difficulties have taken a toll on the German population, particularly in the former East, where unemployment rates remain higher and economic opportunities more limited. Moreover, immigration has become a deeply divisive issue in German society. With a growing percentage of the population born outside of Germany, many citizens feel a sense of cultural insecurity and fear that the nation’s identity is being eroded. The AfD has capitalized on these fears, advocating for tighter immigration controls and a reassertion of German values. Their message has resonated particularly in the East, where the legacy of reunification remains a source of tension. While Germany does require immigration to address its demographic challenges and labor shortages, the rapid pace of immigration has created a perception of cultural and economic strain. This issue has been exacerbated by the ongoing debates over asylum policies and the EU’s handling of migration. The AfD’s success can thus be seen as a reaction to the perceived failure of the political establishment to address these concerns effectively. The CDU’s shift toward the far-right In response to the AfD’s growing influence, the CDU, under the leadership of Friedrich Merz, has begun to shift its stance toward the far-right. Merz, a former lawyer with ties to major international firms, including BlackRock, has sought to consolidate the center-right vote by adopting some of the AfD’s positions, particularly on issues like immigration. His proposals for stricter asylum laws and the tightening of border controls echo the policies championed by the AfD and reflect the growing pressure on the CDU to adopt a tougher stance on migration. Merz’s strategy, however, raises questions about the future direction of the CDU and its relationship with the AfD. While some analysts argue that the CDU is attempting to outflank the AfD on the right, others warn that this could further erode the party’s centrist identity and deepen the political polarization in Germany. The shift to the right is already being felt in the party’s rhetoric, with Merz calling for deregulation of the economy and stronger defense policies in line with the rising nationalist sentiment in Europe. The impact of Germany’s political instability on Europe Germany’s political instability and economic challenges have broader implications for the future of Europe. As the heart of the European Union, Germany’s struggles to maintain political cohesion and economic stability could have far-reaching consequences for the entire continent. A fractured Germany is unlikely to provide the leadership needed to navigate the complex geopolitical challenges facing Europe, from the ongoing conflict in Ukraine to the growing threat posed by Russia. The lack of a strong, unified German government also undermines Europe’s ability to respond effectively to global challenges. With the United States increasingly focused on domestic issues and shifting its attention away from Europe, the continent may find itself exposed to geopolitical risks. In the absence of a coherent European strategy, populist leaders like Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin could exploit Europe’s weaknesses, further undermining the region’s influence on the global stage. Germany’s failure to address its internal divisions could result in a Europe that is fragmented, weakened and increasingly susceptible to external pressures. As the continent grapples with an aging population, economic stagnation and rising political extremism, the prospect of a more cohesive EU seems increasingly unlikely. A long road ahead Germany’s political future is uncertain, with deep divisions in society and a lack of consensus on key issues. The rise of the AfD and the CDU’s shift toward the far-right reflect the growing dissatisfaction with the political establishment and the challenges facing Germany in the 21st century. As the country grapples with economic stagnation, immigration concerns and a fractured political system, the path forward will require difficult compromises and painful reforms. Without a strong and unified government, Germany risks losing its leadership role in Europe, leaving the continent vulnerable to external threats and internal disarray. The coming years will be critical in determining whether Germany can overcome its political paralysis and reclaim its position as a stable and effective force in Europe and the world.

Merz’s strategy, however, raises questions about the future direction of the CDU and its relationship with the AfD. While some analysts argue that the CDU is attempting to outflank the AfD on the right, others warn that this could further erode the party’s centrist identity and deepen the political polarization in Germany. The shift to the right is already being felt in the party’s rhetoric, with Merz calling for deregulation of the economy and stronger defense policies in line with the rising nationalist sentiment in Europe. Germany’s political instability and economic challenges have broader implications for the future of Europe. As the heart of the European Union, Germany’s struggles to maintain political cohesion and economic stability could have far-reaching consequences for the entire continent. A fractured Germany is unlikely to provide the leadership needed to navigate the complex geopolitical challenges facing Europe, from the ongoing conflict in Ukraine to the growing threat posed by Russia. The lack of a strong, unified German government also undermines Europe’s ability to respond effectively to global challenges. With the United States increasingly focused on domestic issues and shifting its attention away from Europe, the continent may find itself exposed to geopolitical risks. In the absence of a coherent European strategy, populist leaders like Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin could exploit Europe’s weaknesses, further undermining the region’s influence on the global stage. Germany’s failure to address its internal divisions could result in a Europe that is fragmented, weakened and increasingly susceptible to external pressures. As the continent grapples with an aging population, economic stagnation and rising political extremism, the prospect of a more cohesive EU seems increasingly unlikely. Germany’s political future is uncertain, with deep divisions in society and a lack of consensus on key issues. The rise of the AfD and the CDU’s shift toward the far-right reflect the growing dissatisfaction with the political establishment and the challenges facing Germany in the 21st century. As the country grapples with economic stagnation, immigration concerns and a fractured political system, the path forward will require difficult compromises and painful reforms. Without a strong and unified government, Germany risks losing its leadership role in Europe, leaving the continent vulnerable to external threats and internal disarray. The coming years will be critical in determining whether Germany can overcome its political paralysis and reclaim its position as a stable and effective force in Europe and the world.

Title: Trump hails retaliatory tariffs in defense of America's jobs and its soul

Manufacturers are already shifting some operations from Asia in response to his policy, Trump says. By Mike Firn for RFA 2025.03.05 BANGKOK -- U.S. President Donald Trump defended on Tuesday his policy on tariffs saying reciprocal duties to be imposed across the board from April 2 would not only protect U.S. jobs but would defend the soul of the country. Trump, in his address to a joint session of Congress six weeks after taking office for a second term, said tariffs was "a beautiful word" and his policy was already seeing manufacturers relocating facilities to the U.S. from Asia. "On April 2, reciprocal tariffs kick in and whatever they charge us on tariffs we will charge them, a reciprocal back and forth," Trump said to the applause of his Republican supporters. "If they use non-monetary tariffs to keep us out of their market, we will use non-monetary barriers to keep them out of our market." Earlier on Tuesday, the U.S. imposed 25% duties on Mexican and Canadian imports and doubled tariffs imposed on China last month to 20%. China responded immediately, taxing U.S. farm imports by as much as 15%. It also imposed export and investment restrictions on 25 American firms, citing national security. "The Chinese people will not be intimidated," Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lin Jian said at a regular news conference. In his speech to Congress, Trump said China was already taxing U.S. exporters too much. "China's average tariff is twice what we charge them," he said, adding that he would match any country's retaliatory tariffs. Trump said the threat of tariffs had already had an impact on the business plans of Japan's Honda, America's Apple and Taiwan chipmaker TSMC. All three companies recently announced large investments to shift some manufacturing to the U.S. "If you don't make your product in America you will pay a tariff," Trump said. "Tariffs are not just about protecting American jobs, they are about protecting the soul of our country." While economists have warned of the impact of tariffs on pushing up prices for U.S. consumers, Trump dismissed concerns of any negative impact. "There may be a little bit of a disturbance but we're OK with that," he said. Trump said he could balance the budget while offering "tax cuts for everyone." China's premier Li Qiang said China's economy would match last year's growth in spite of a trade war with the U.S. Speaking at the opening of the annual National People's Congress in Beijing on Wednesday, he said the economy would expand by around 5% this year. Li said Beijing was willing to let the budget deficit expand to fuel an upturn in domestic demand as the "main engine and anchor" of growth. Trading accusations on drugs Part of the reason for Trump's tariffs on Mexico and Canada is what he says is their failure to stop the flow of deadly fentanyl into the United States, which the U.S. president said Tuesday was "destroying our families." Both of those countries have defended their actions to stop drug smuggling. Trump has also accused China of failing to stamp out production of the synthetic opioid but China says it has already done its part to control the drug and it should not be blamed for a U.S. "governance failure." On Tuesday, Beijing released a white paper highlighting the steps it had taken to control the spread of fentanyl. "These have delivered notable results," it said. Reporting on the findings, the state-run tabloid Global Times hit out at Trump for blaming China for America's opioid problem and punishing it with tariffs. "Shifting the responsibility for domestic governance failures onto others and abusing tariffs as a means of pressure and coercion will not cure America's ills, nor will it help Washington achieve its political objectives," it said in an editorial. In his speech, Trump also repeated his pledge to take control of the Panama Canal. "It was given away by the Carter administration for one dollar but that agreement has been violated," he said. "We didn't give it to China. We gave it to Panama and we're taking it back." Earlier on Tuesday, Hong Kong's CK Hutchison Holding said a consortium including America's BlackRock would acquire Hutchison Ports and Panama Ports giving it control of the ports at either end of the canal.

Title: Chinese FM responds to potential acquisition related to Panama Canal, opposes coercion in international trade

Global Times By Global Times Published: Mar 05, 2025 04:57 PM In response to media inquiries regarding a consortium led by US investment firm BlackRock potentially acquiring a Hong Kong company with the aim of taking control of Hong Kong company's stake in the Panama Canal, saying the move is under pressure of the White House, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian stated that we don't comment on the relevant business transaction. He noted that the Hong Kong SAR government had previously addressed issues related to the company's port operations. As a matter of principle, Lin emphasized that China supports its enterprises, including those from Hong Kong, in investing and developing businesses overseas. He also stressed that all countries should provide a fair and just environment for relevant enterprises, adding that we oppose the use of coercion and pressure in international economic and trade relations. When addressing another question related to the Panama Canal, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian stated that China supports Panama's sovereignty over the Panama Canal and is committed to upholding the Canal's status as a permanently neutral international waterway. He emphasized that China has never participated in managing or operating the Canal, nor has it interfered in its affairs. The claim that "China controls the Canal" is completely a lie, according to CCTV News on Wednesday.

Title: Panama President Mulino says Trump ‘lying’ about reclaiming the canal

Panamanian leader says sale of a Chinese company’s port operation to a US firm does not amount to retaking the waterway. Panama President Jose Raul Mulino has accused his American counterpart, Donald Trump, of lying when he told members of Congress that the United States is “reclaiming” the Panama Canal. In a statement posted on X on Wednesday, Mulino said the man-made waterway that connects the Atlantic and Pacific oceans “is not in the process of recovery” by Trump and the US government. “Once again, President Trump is lying,” Mulino wrote on X. “I reject, on behalf of Panama and all Panamanians, this new affront to the truth and to our dignity as a nation,” Mulino added. During the annual presidential address to the US Congress on Tuesday, Trump declared that Washington would be reclaiming the Panama Canal “to further enhance” US national security. “We’ve already started doing it. We’re taking it back.” He was referencing a deal announced on Tuesday for a consortium, led by the US investment management company BlackRock Inc, to buy a controlling stake in the company held by a Chinese group that operates ports at both ends of one of the busiest water channels in the world. In a filing, CK Hutchison Holding had announced that it would sell all shares in Hutchison Port Holdings and in Hutchison Port Group Holdings to BlackRock in a deal valued at nearly $23bn, including $5bn in debt. The deal has to be approved by Panama’s government. Trump has been talking about retaking the Panama Canal since his campaign, arguing the US should have never turned control over to the Panamanians and that the US was being overcharged for using it. Since returning to the White House, he has also started complaining that China controls the canal, and did not rule out a military invasion to regain control of it. Panama maintains it has full control over the canal and that the Hong Kong-based group’s operation of the ports did not amount to Chinese control over the waterway, and therefore the private sale to a US-based company would not represent any US “reclaiming” of the canal. In February, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio met with Mulino and insisted that China was exerting influence over the canal’s operations. Panama rejected that China had any influence over canal operations. Beijing has also consistently denied interfering in the canal. The US built the canal in the early 1900s as it looked for ways to facilitate the transit of commercial and military vessels between its coasts. Washington relinquished control of the waterway to Panama on December 31, 1999, under a treaty signed in 1977 by President Jimmy Carter. Trump has claimed that Carter “foolishly” gave the canal away. The 80km (50-mile) canal handles 5 percent of global maritime trade and 40 percent of US container traffic. Follow Al Jazeera English:

Title: Brevan Howard's pitch to deep-pocketed investors: The 'true risk' of crypto is not having exposure
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/brevan-howard-digital-assets-crypto-investing-investor-pitch-aron-landy-2025-3
Time Published: 2025-03-06T10:03:01Z
Full Content:
Aron Landy — the CEO of $34 billion macro investment manager Brevan Howard — believes the "tipping point" that will lead institutional investors to pile into crypto is on the horizon. Years of volatility and big-name bad actors have kept institutions away from digital assets. Still, with a new administration in the US and asset managers like BlackRock and Fidelity becoming more entrenched in the space, the world's biggest investors will slowly wade into the space — and then dive fully in. London-based Brevan Howard, through its $2.5 billion stand-alone crypto unit that was up over 52% last year, is aiming to be the place to go for crypto-curious institutions. "The predominant mindset in the institutional space has been that any exposure to digital assets is a little too volatile," Landy told Business Insider. "I believe that a shift in mindset is happening and that soon, even this year, having zero exposure to digital assets will be the true risk." "At the moment, it's kind of a separate asset class, but over time, there'll be a convergence," he added. That convergence may be sped up by President Donald Trump's administration. After years of frustration under former President Joe Biden's SEC commissioner Gary Gensler, President Donald Trump, and his crypto czar David Sacks have provided a jolt to the space. While some have been frustrated with the administration's crypto agenda, including the creation of meme coins related to Trump and the first lady, Melania Trump, and the strategic reserve of different digital assets, the election was a positive change for the industry, said Gautam Sharma, the CEO and chief investment officer of Brevan Howard Digital. Sharma declined to provide additional comment on the creation of the reserve. The size of the talent pool and the amount of capital in the US means the "vibe" around an industry can matter just as much as a specific policy, Sharma said. Brevan thinks of the industry as a "transformational technology" akin to the internet, Landy said, and "any new innovation needs two things: talent and capital," Sharma said. The two executives said there should be plenty of momentum to attract ambitious young people to the industry. "The digital asset universe has tailwinds, not headwinds," Landy said. September will be the unit's fourth anniversary, and Sharma told BI that the goal remains the same as when they launched in 2021. "Our objective is to be the leading asset manager for institutional investors in digital assets," he said, noting that the manager is working on a few additional products for institutional investors to add alongside its flagship multi-manager crypto fund. As the digital asset space becomes more integrated into financial institutions and accepted by regulators, big-name asset managers will follow suit. Former crypto critics, like Citadel Securities' Ken Griffin, are embracing the space and building out their offerings because of the tailwinds. Among alternative investors, especially those catering to large institutional investors like sovereign wealth and pension funds, Brevan has a relative headstart thanks partly to its founder, billionaire Alan Howard. Howard has been interested in the space for close to a decade and started investing his personal capital in 2016 and has seen firsthand how the industry has changed, Sharma said. "Alan understands this space better than most, not just the investing side of it but the systems," said Sharma, who previously ran internal projects for the hedge fund and oversaw the buildout of the digital assets business alongside Natalie Smith, the firm's head of strategy and client partnership group. Howard's enthusiasm led Brevan Howard Digital to focus not just on hiring investing staff, technologists, and engineers. The firm built the unit's infrastructure from scratch over six months in 2021 and now has a team of more than 60 people in eight offices that can trade around the clock. A person close to Brevan said the firm's digital asset investment products have "relatively long lock-up periods" to help the firm withstand volatility. It aligns with the firm's belief that small bumps in the road will be just that: bumps in the road. The digital asset industry "could be worth many multiples than what it is now," Landy said, and the firm wants to partner with institutions willing to back that long-term vision. The separate digital-asset unit invests in liquid coins such as Bitcoin but also options, derivatives, and private stakes in startups. Brevan Howard Digital also helps diversity the firm's largest multistrategy funds, managing sleeves of capital for the $12 billion master fund. "The reason to invest is not because it's going up, or that it's gone down and therefore cheap," but instead to be exposed to something transformational for all industries, Landy said. The firm's conviction in the industry comes not just from Howard's personal interest, but the many engineers and technologists inside the firm who have been passionate about the space for years, he said. "From a macro investing perspective, investors should have some exposure to it," he said, and the firm is ready for the "tipping point" that will lead to institutions flooding in. "Having some exposure will be the norm," Landy said, and those who choose Brevan "invest with us because they want our expertise." Jump to

Title: Proxy Adviser Glass Lewis Sticks With Diversity Guidance, Will Flag Risks

Proxy adviser Glass Lewis will continue to consider boardroom diversity when advising how to vote at U.S. company annual meetings, but plans to be clearer about the counter argument for critical vote recommendations to help clients avoid rising political risks. The change comes amid a wave of retreat by U.S. corporations from their diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) efforts, under threat of legal action by U.S. President Donald Trump’s Justice Department. The decision by Glass Lewis to remain largely committed to diversity follows a review of its policies and after proxy advisor rival Institutional Shareholder Services last month said it would no longer consider diversity when making its boardroom recommendations. In an e-mail to clients seen by Reuters, Glass Lewis said it will stand by its 2025 benchmark guidelines for U.S. companies, which include that shareholders vote against certain directors at some of the largest U.S. companies whose boards lack gender, racial or LGBTQ diversity. But when it recommends votes against a director in any way related to diversity, Glass Lewis said it will also flag information that could support an alternative vote by the client. “This approach allows Glass Lewis to deliver the vote recommendations expected by clients while also clearly flagging the potential risk that may result from an AGAINST vote decision and providing a clear path should some clients choose to vote FOR the proposal,” the firm said. A Glass Lewis spokeswoman said it also will likely include more context when making recommendations on diversity-related shareholder proposals. Glass Lewis and ISS dominate the U.S. market for selling recommendations about how investors should vote at corporate meetings on matters such as boardroom elections or executive pay. Glass Lewis counts some 1,300 clients globally including top pension plans, mutual funds and asset managers with more than $40 trillion in collective assets. Their policies are widely used by investors including mutual funds and pension plans which may not have the resources to do due diligence on every company in their portfolio. “Certainly, we would have preferred not to have had to deliberate over long-standing policy guidelines on board diversity and DEI shareholder proposals, but the U.S. Administration’s opposition to DEI is compelling companies, institutional investors and their proxy advisors to consider changes, now or in the future,” Glass Lewis’ note said. The move echoes steps taken by major asset managers including BlackRock BLK.N and Vanguard, which faced pressure over their voting decisions and in response looked to give clients more control.

Title: Panama President Issues Defiant Response To Trump Over 'Reclaiming' Canal Line

PANAMA CITY (AP) — Panama President José Raúl Mulino on Wednesday accused U.S. President Donald Trump of lying when he said in his address to Congress that his administration was “reclaiming” the Panama Canal. Trump was referencing a deal announced Tuesday for a consortium led by the U.S. investment management company BlackRock Inc. to buy a controlling stake in the company held by a Chinese group that operates ports at both ends of the Panama Canal. Panama maintains that it has full control over the canal and that the Hong Kong-based group’s operation of the ports did not amount to Chinese control over the waterway, and that therefore the sale to a U.S.-based company would not represent any U.S. “reclaiming” of the canal. Panama’s government on Tuesday called the sale a private transaction. Mulino in a message posted to X on Wednesday, rejected that the deal came about because of U.S. pressure. “I reject in the name of Panama and all Panamanians this new affront to the truth and our dignity as a nation,” he wrote. He accused Trump of “lying again.” Trump has talked about retaking the Panama Canal since his campaign, arguing that the U.S. should have never turned control over to the Panamanians and that the U.S. was being overcharged for using it. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio met with Mulino in early February and insisted that China was exerting influence over the canal’s operations. The focus was the Chinese consortium running the ports. Panama rejected that China had any influence over canal operations. “Cooperation between our governments passes through clear understandings in terms of issues of mutual interest,” Mulino wrote. “It doesn’t have anything to do with ‘reclaiming the canal’ nor with tarnishing our national sovereignty.” In a filing, CK Hutchison Holding said Tuesday that it would sell all shares in Hutchison Port Holdings and in Hutchison Port Group Holdings to the BlackRock consortium in a deal valued at nearly $23 billion, including $5 billion in debt. The deal has to be approved by Panama’s government. The United States built the canal in the early 1900s as it looked for ways to facilitate the transit of commercial and military vessels between its coasts. Washington relinquished control of the waterway to Panama on Dec. 31, 1999, under a treaty signed in 1977 by President Jimmy Carter. Trump has claimed that Carter “foolishly” gave the canal away. Frank Sixt, co-managing director of CK Hutchison, said in a statement that the transaction was “the result of a rapid, discrete but competitive process in which numerous bids and expressions of interest were received.” The next four years will change America forever.

Title: How has ‘public squalor’ become so normalised in our towns and cities?

Housing vacancy is again making headlines. Figures from GeoDirectory, which is a joint venture between Tailte Éireann and An Post, estimates the housing vacancy rate at 3.8 per cent or 81,449 houses. Census 2022 by the CSO calculated Ireland’s housing vacancy at more than 163,000 houses, or 7.7 per cent. Forty-eight thousand houses were vacant for more than five years and, again according to GeoDirectory, an additional 20,092 were derelict. We need some degree of vacancy to align sellers and buyers, and based on GeoDirectory figures we do not have a housing vacancy problem. A stroll through many of the State’s cities and towns, however, would suggest that this conclusion is perhaps optimistic. (Questions to GeoDirectory about the difference between its figures and CSO calculations went unanswered.) Last year architects Frank O’Connor and Jude Sherry recorded 700 empty properties within two kilometres of Cork city centre, about 70 per cent of which was housing. At the same time, there are 2,893 households on the Cork City social housing waiting list, or just 300 houses for sale if that is your preferred metric. “Dereliction eats away the urban fabric [and] wastes vital resources, makes areas look ugly and feel unsafe. So why has it been normalised and enabled by the State?” O’Connor asks. It is a fair question. A cultural aversion to interfering with what people do with their properties or even asking owners what they are doing with them is part of the problem. An assumption that property rights are non-negotiable and take precedence over the common good has also led to a propensity for people doing what they want with their property or nothing at all. There are penalties on buildings that end up on a council’s Derelict Sites Register, but their application nationally is sclerotic. At the end of 2023, Dublin City Council was owed €6.8 million in unpaid derelict buildings fines. Councils are also culprits themselves: “Chances are, in Dublin, if it has buddleia growing on it, it’s owned by the local authority,” Ciarán Cuffe, the former councillor and MEP, recently told the Dublin Inquirer. [ Derelict Victorian houses ‘crumbling’ six years after €700,000 purchase by Dublin City CouncilOpens in new window ] A “vacancy relief” for commercial rates for those with unoccupied shops and offices, including those above the shop, is also questionable. In France, nearly 3,700 towns have introduced a tax of 17 per cent of the rental value of a property empty for more than one year, rising to 34 per cent in year two. Here, as this newspaper’s recent series on Derelict Dublin showed, important and run-of-the-mill buildings lie vacant for decades to the point of dereliction and we pay little heed and often no penalties. As with a lot of Irish regulation, laissez-faire enforcement is the norm, and it just doesn’t work. Vacant and derelict buildings stem from market, policy and ideological failure. The result is unpleasant environments, and towns and villages dying for the want of inhabitants, at the same time as multiple buildings sit empty. Sometimes for reasons of affordability, sometimes because the town isn’t attractive – and sometimes just because of their own notions of grandeur – people build new houses outside towns and drive everywhere. Both practices are unsustainable. Legislation, policy or technical solutions can only do so much – in the end it is about the State as much as it is about individuals Attempts to beautify towns and woo back inhabitants to by improving the urban experience with more public seating, pedestrian crossings and wider footpaths, for example, often run into sand for one reason: councillors don’t want any parking removed. Yet research shows three things: walking, cycling and public realm improvements can increase retail sales by 30 per cent; Irish retailers overestimate the proportion of their customers who arrive by car to do their shopping and underestimate those who walk; and people who walk to the shops go there more often. A good public realm is a good business realm. In towns where the public realm has been improved, footfall and business has increased. See Blackrock, Co Dublin, or Virginia, Co Cavan, or Clonakilty, Co Cork. Ireland’s market towns in particular, the Strokestowns and Templemores with their wide streets, have huge potential for attractive urban realms to entice new families and business. Ireland’s capital exhibits the characteristics of both a shanty town and a beautiful town. The difference between Dublin and comparable international cities is that these characteristics often exist side-by-side on the same street, including its main thoroughfare; what Jude Sherry calls “public squalor”. Dublin city had more than 18,000 vacant residential units in Census 2022, with more than 5,000 of these recorded as available “for rent” (there were 34,000 nationwide). A lot of these are illegal short-term lets – the Airbnb phenomenon is another example of letting people do what they want with their property at the expense of wider society. There is now a new Bill to regulate short-terms lets. Buildings aside, the most memorable feature of good cities is the public transport system. Despite being open since December 2017, neither Cabra nor Phibsboro Luas stops have any public street signage. Look at the beautiful bus and metro stations in European cities – with actual signage. We get bus stops on the side of roads with not even a seat or shelter from the rain. In 2017, Fianna Fáil’s Barry Cowen brought forward a good vacant house refurbishment Bill. More recently, the Greens had something similar, but it lapsed with the election. There are refurbishment grants available for vacant and derelict housing, but these are paid retrospectively, reducing their usefulness. There has been limited progress on easing the conversion of vacant above-the-shop units with some exceptions – Waterford City and County Council has been doing good work via the Repair and Lease Scheme. Dereliction and vacancy – and our tolerance for both – are symptoms of a bigger problem: the low value we put on place. Unfortunately, as with road safety, there seems to be only so much legislation, policy or technical solutions can do. In the end it is an issue of attitude – of the State as much as of individuals. For a country allegedly obsessed with property we care surprisingly little for it, apart from its financial value of course. The engraving on 19th century engineer Thomas Drummond’s plinth in Dublin City Hall reads: “Property has its duties as well as its rights.” It should be imprinted on the deeds of every building in the country.

Title: Trump lays out bold vision for America in first joint session of Congress

The address was met with a mix of fervent applause and predictable jeers from Democrats, who have become the embodiment of obstructionism and defeatism in the face of Trumpâs bold agenda. From reclaiming the Panama Canal to cracking down on illegal immigration and vowing to plant the American flag on Mars, Trumpâs speech was a clarion call for a stronger, prouder, and more self-reliant America. Reclaiming the Panama Canal and securing Greenland One of the most striking moments of the speech came when Trump announced his administrationâs efforts to âreclaim the Panama Canalâ for the United States. âThe Panama Canal was built by Americans for Americans, not for others,â Trump declared, referencing reports that U.S. investment firm BlackRock is set to purchase the canalâs port infrastructure from its current Chinese owner. Trumpâs remarks underscored his unwavering commitment to restoring American control over strategic assets that have been mismanaged or exploited by foreign powers. âWe didnât give it to China. We gave it to Panama, and weâre taking it back,â he said, drawing thunderous applause from his supporters. The president also reignited his push to secure Greenland, a move that has long been a point of contention with Denmark. âThe people of Greenland deserve the right to determine their future,â Trump said, suggesting that the island could break away from Denmark and join the United States. âWe need Greenland, and we will secure it one way or the other,â he added, signaling his determination to expand American influence in the Arctic region. Ending the Ukraine conflict and restoring American diplomacy Trump also addressed the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, reiterating his commitment to ending what he called a âsenselessâ war. He criticized Democratic leaders, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, for their apparent willingness to prolong the conflict. âSome people would rather see this war drag on for another five years,â Trump said, taking a swipe at Warren, whom he derisively referred to as âPocahontas.â The president highlighted his administrationâs efforts to broker peace between Ukraine and Russia, emphasizing that fostering normal diplomatic relations with Moscow serves American interests. Despite recent tensions with Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky, Trump announced that a minerals agreement between the U.S. and Ukraine was back on track, citing Zelenskyâs renewed commitment to peace and partnership. Cracking down on illegal immigration and ending wokism Domestically, Trump focused on his administrationâs achievements in border security and immigration enforcement. He invited several guests to Capitol Hill whose stories shine a light on the human cost of illegal immigration, including family members of crime victims targeted by undocumented immigrants and a Border Patrol agent injured in the line of duty. Trump also took aim at the cultural left, declaring an end to the âtyranny of so-called diversity, equity, and inclusion policies.â He called on Congress to criminalize âsex changes on children,â denouncing the idea that a child can be âtrapped in the wrong bodyâ as âa big lie.â His supporters cheered the move as a long-overdue measure to protect children from irreversible medical procedures. The president also defended his decision to reinstate the ban on transgender individuals serving in the military, stating, âOur soldiers wonât be activists and ideologues â they will be fighters and warriors.â Elon Musk, Mars, and the American spirit of innovation Trump reserved special praise for Elon Musk, whose leadership at the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has uncovered billions in government waste and fraud. âElon Musk is a true American pioneer,â Trump said, celebrating Muskâs efforts to dismantle the ârule by unelected bureaucrats.â Looking to the future, Trump vowed that his second term would yield historic accomplishments, including the colonization of Mars. âWe are going to lead humanity into space and plant the American flag on the planet Mars and even far beyond,â he declared, echoing Muskâs vision for interplanetary exploration. Trumpâs speech was a powerful reminder of the resilience and determination that have defined America throughout its history. From reclaiming strategic assets to ending cultural divisiveness and pushing the boundaries of human achievement, Trumpâs vision for America is one of strength, pride, and boundless possibility. As the nation moves forward under Trumpâs leadership, the contrast between his bold agenda and the petulant obstructionism of the Democrats could not be clearer. While the left clings to its dogma of division and decline, Trumpâs America is rising, stronger and more united than ever. The road ahead is long, but with courage, common sense, and an unwavering commitment to the American spirit, the best is yet to come.

The president also reignited his push to secure Greenland, a move that has long been a point of contention with Denmark. âThe people of Greenland deserve the right to determine their future,â Trump said, suggesting that the island could break away from Denmark and join the United States. âWe need Greenland, and we will secure it one way or the other,â he added, signaling his determination to expand American influence in the Arctic region. Ending the Ukraine conflict and restoring American diplomacy Trump also addressed the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, reiterating his commitment to ending what he called a âsenselessâ war. He criticized Democratic leaders, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, for their apparent willingness to prolong the conflict. âSome people would rather see this war drag on for another five years,â Trump said, taking a swipe at Warren, whom he derisively referred to as âPocahontas.â The president highlighted his administrationâs efforts to broker peace between Ukraine and Russia, emphasizing that fostering normal diplomatic relations with Moscow serves American interests. Despite recent tensions with Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky, Trump announced that a minerals agreement between the U.S. and Ukraine was back on track, citing Zelenskyâs renewed commitment to peace and partnership. Cracking down on illegal immigration and ending wokism Domestically, Trump focused on his administrationâs achievements in border security and immigration enforcement. He invited several guests to Capitol Hill whose stories shine a light on the human cost of illegal immigration, including family members of crime victims targeted by undocumented immigrants and a Border Patrol agent injured in the line of duty. Trump also took aim at the cultural left, declaring an end to the âtyranny of so-called diversity, equity, and inclusion policies.â He called on Congress to criminalize âsex changes on children,â denouncing the idea that a child can be âtrapped in the wrong bodyâ as âa big lie.â His supporters cheered the move as a long-overdue measure to protect children from irreversible medical procedures. The president also defended his decision to reinstate the ban on transgender individuals serving in the military, stating, âOur soldiers wonât be activists and ideologues â they will be fighters and warriors.â Elon Musk, Mars, and the American spirit of innovation Trump reserved special praise for Elon Musk, whose leadership at the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has uncovered billions in government waste and fraud. âElon Musk is a true American pioneer,â Trump said, celebrating Muskâs efforts to dismantle the ârule by unelected bureaucrats.â Looking to the future, Trump vowed that his second term would yield historic accomplishments, including the colonization of Mars. âWe are going to lead humanity into space and plant the American flag on the planet Mars and even far beyond,â he declared, echoing Muskâs vision for interplanetary exploration. Trumpâs speech was a powerful reminder of the resilience and determination that have defined America throughout its history. From reclaiming strategic assets to ending cultural divisiveness and pushing the boundaries of human achievement, Trumpâs vision for America is one of strength, pride, and boundless possibility. As the nation moves forward under Trumpâs leadership, the contrast between his bold agenda and the petulant obstructionism of the Democrats could not be clearer. While the left clings to its dogma of division and decline, Trumpâs America is rising, stronger and more united than ever. The road ahead is long, but with courage, common sense, and an unwavering commitment to the American spirit, the best is yet to come.
