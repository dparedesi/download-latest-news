Title: Ten restaurants around Ireland worth travelling to for an unique experience

Aniar is so much more than a Michelin-starred restaurant. After all, owner JP McMahon is truly dedicated to Irish food. Following 13 years in business, Aniar recently underwent a refit in conjunction with Marmar Architects, and the result is an interior that guides the diner through the 24-course tasting menu experience, all the time subtly mirroring the landscape of the west of Ireland. Joanne Cronin Sam and Emily Moody’s fine-dining spot in Abbeyleix focuses on local, seasonal ingredients and precise cooking, drawing on Sam’s pedigree (Ballyfin, Bath Priory). The lunch menu and midweek “Supper at Six” offer great value but dinner is where the kitchen shines, with a la carte and tasting menus (€75) using vegetables from their walled garden. Highlights include honey-glazed quail with leek emulsion and organic slow roast duck. CH Change is in the air at Ashford Castle. The stately, dark wood panelling of the George V diningroom is now home to executive head chef Liam Finnegan, who works closely with the estate’s newly planted kitchen garden and local suppliers to bring a modern touch to the classics-inspired menu. The wine cellar is famously richly stocked, and has an extensive list of wines by the glass. JC In a restored 200-year-old cottage, Michelin-starred chef Robbie McCauley crafts precise, seasonal dishes, using produce from his own organic garden and ducks he raises himself. With his wife Sophie running the front of house, the experience is both personal and polished. Dishes such as fallow deer with fermented red cabbage or Liscannor Bay crab with garden kohlrabi show the kitchen’s sensitivity to seasonality on the eight-course tasting menu (€109). From November a seven-course afternoon menu (€70), running from 2pm-6pm, adds another option. CH Owner Damien Grey recently announced on Instagram that Liath is looking for a new home. But fear not – for the time being the Blackrock Market continues to host this tiny fine-dining powerhouse. Liath has a philosophy that espouses exploration of the senses, so the diner is drawn inward over the course of the meal into the imagination of Grey and head chef, Jozef Radacovsky. JC Despite being possibly the busiest man in Irish cooking, with television shows, demonstrations and cookware ranges, Neven Maguire’s MacNean House and Restaurant remains one of the most popular destinations in Ireland for a special meal. Often booked out months in advance, the generous hospitality and even more generous cooking from head chef Carmel McGirr feels very special indeed. JC Rob Krawczyk’s Michelin-starred tasting menu is all about restraint, showcasing local ingredients with skill. His home-made charcuterie and organic produce from Lisheen Greens flow through the courses. The four-course menu (€70) offers a taste of his craft, while the Signature Tasting (€149) includes wild halibut with Roaring Water Bay mussels. Upstairs, it’s more laid-back with “Small Plates, Nibbles & Snacks.” Closes through January. CH Dining at Terre is a spectacle from the moment you set foot inside, and it’s not just the open kitchen where French chef Vincent Crepel overseas the dramatically lit pass. It’s the quality of produce and the precision of cooking that makes this two-Michelin-starred restaurant so special. Age-old French cooking methods are coupled with a strong Asian influence on the €250, 11-course tasting menu, with dishes such as hamachi with home-made kosho and Ballycotton lobster with whey sauce. CH The lavish Oak Room delivers all the grandeur that one would expect at one of Ireland’s finest hotels. Service is impeccable, allowing the spotlight to shine on chef Mike Tweedie’s elegant and polished cooking. Since taking over in 2017, Tweedie has truly settled in, finding his way unerringly to the best Irish produce including Doonbeg lobster, Dooncastle oysters and meat from Higgin’s butchers. JC Chef Danni Barry works magic with the freshest seasonal ingredients, crafting visually stunning plates with a light, refined touch. The four-course table d’hote menu (€90) highlights this simplicity: cured scallops with cucumber and nasturtiums, perfectly cooked halibut with morels, and wild venison with garden beets. The Library, which was recently redecorated, now has a conservatory and terrace, and is perfect for a pre-dinner cocktail.

CNBC Daily Open brings investors up to speed on everything they need to know, no matter where they are. Like what you see? You can subscribe here. Markets ended week in the red U.S. markets slumped on Friday and ended the week lower. The S&P 500 fell 1.32%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.7% and the Nasdaq Composite tumbled 2.24%. Europe's Stoxx 600 lost 0.77%, its fourth straight losing week. Separately, the U.K. economy grew 0.1% in the third quarter, missing the 0.2% mark expected by economists. Caught in the crossfire China may be the target of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's hawkish trade policies, but U.S. companies could suffer in the crossfire. If Trump does implement his tariffs on China, the Chinese government could retaliate by introducing its own tariffs, diversifying its imports away from the U.S and increasing scrutiny of U.S. firms operating in China. Last official Biden-Xi meeting U.S. President Joe Biden met his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping on Saturday at the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit. Biden reflected on his relationship with Xi across decades, while Xi seemed more focused on Trump's presidency, saying: "China is ready to work with a new U.S. administration to maintain communication, expand cooperation and manage differences." To infinity Pure-play space companies have seen their shares soar over the past week. For example, shares of Rocket Lab, an aerospace manufacturer, popped 41% on a weekly basis. While that was ignited by positive news from the company's earnings report, analysts say the "Trump-Elon" trade is also behind the gravity-defying moves of space stocks. [PRO] Nvidia sets the tone this week Markets had a wild few weeks, during which investors digested the U.S. presidential election results, the Federal Reserve cutting rates, inflation readings and Fed Chair Jerome Powell's hawkish comments. This week, all eyes will be trained on one key event: Nvidia's earnings, coming out Wednesday. Trump's decisive victory in the presidential elections, as well as his purportedly market-friendly policies, drove markets to new highs. Last Monday, the S&P closed above 6,000 and the Dow finished the day above 44,000 for the first time. The so-called "Trump trade" — shares of banks, small-cap companies and energy, for example — were behind much of the indexes' gains. As anyone who has overeaten at a feast knows, however, there's a point when satisfaction passes into satiation into surfeit. It was only the start of the week, but little did we know we were beginning at the peak. When markets closed on Friday, the S&P lost 2.1% and the Dow had fallen 1.2% for the week — both ending the week below their milestones. The Nasdaq slid 3.2% on a weekly basis. A slump in pharmaceutical stocks dragged down the S&P and Dow. It was triggered by Trump announcing he was planning to nominate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has expressed unorthodox beliefs on health, to lead the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. This illustrates how investors must delicately navigate Trump's policies, which often present themselves as double-edged swords. For instance, Trump's proposed tariff and tax cuts will buoy up small caps and expand corporate profits but might also keep inflation hot and interest rates high – which were the worries weighing on markets last week. "In the near term we should expect some micro volatility, particularly around potential policy shifts under a new administration," said Kristy Akullian, head of iShares investment strategy, Americas, at BlackRock. That said, Akullian added that BlackRock does "expect the U.S. equity market to continue to move higher, but don't expect that rise to happen in a straight line." After surfeit comes digestion and then hunger. And the process starts again. — CNBC's Jeff Cox, Brian Evans and Alex Harring contributed to this report. Got a confidential news tip?

Title: Block, Inc. (SQ): Among ARK Invest’s Top Stock Picks for 2024

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the ARK Invest Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Stock Picks for 2024. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) stands against ARK Invest's top stock picks for 2024. ARK Investment Management LLC, more commonly known as ARK Invest, is an American investment management firm headquartered in St. Petersburg, Florida, that oversees several actively managed ETFs. It was registered in 2014 by Catherine Wood, who is known for making big bets on disruptive technology like self-driving carse and genomics. The investment fund has around $6.7 billion in assets under management. READ ALSO: Cathie Wood’s 11 Favorite AI Stocks and Jim Cramer November Portfolio: Top 10 Stocks. Wood’s flagship fund has faced pressures for the third straight year, with outflows at nearly $1.8 billion during the first six months of 2024, which was close to triple the outflows seen in 2023. Its closing price of $57.85 on November 11 was down 60% from the highs of early 2021. In a letter posted to investors in July, she acknowledged that the fund’s performance was challenged by certain stock picks and the overall macroeconomic environment, but added that ‘our conviction in and commitment to investing in disruptive innovation have not wavered’. The ARK Invest CEO argued that the fund’s holdings were set to benefit once the Fed rate cuts begin and that she anticipates another period of strong returns, reminiscent of the gains witnessed during the initial days of the pandemic. In August this year, in the hope of buying the dip, Wood piled into several tech stocks whose shares had tumbled in the months prior. Since the announcement of interest rate cuts in September, ARK’s flagship ETF has grown 25%, with a major upward spike in the week running up to and following the presidential elections, which Donald Trump won on November 5. In a post-election message released to investors, Wood likened the country’s current economic situation to the Reagan era in the early 1980s, when the interest rate and tax cuts resulted in robust economic growth, eventually helping the United States grow out of deficit and into a surplus in the Clinton era. Cathie Wood predicts a bright future and has stated that Trump’s policies will ‘turbocharge’ the American economy more powerfully than the Reagan Revolution did. She expects the newly elected president to slash regulations and cut tax rates, as he did during his first term. Trump during his election campaign vowed to reduce the corporate tax rate to 15%, after having already cut the rate from 35% to 21% in his presidency between 2017 and 2021. Having said that, Wood believes that businesses will put investments on hold until the promised cuts are delivered, which means the positive anticipated impact on the economy will be delayed. We scanned the ARK Investment Management portfolio, as of September 30, 2024, and picked the top 10 stocks according to their stake value. The figures were sourced from the Insider Monkey Database. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). People using the Cash App paying for goods and services, highlighting the impact the of the company's payment tools. Stake Value as of Q3 2024: $444,767,776 Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) is an American company that offers financial services to clients through its two segments: Square and Cash App. The Square segment includes managed payment services, hardware, software solutions, and other financial services that help sellers start and run their businesses. The Cash App segment offers consumers financial tools via the mobile app, allowing them to make payments, invest in stocks and bitcoin, and more. The company was formerly known as Square, Inc., until 2021, when it decided to change the name to Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ), reflecting its growing focus on crypto and blockchain technologies. On November 7, the company held its third-quarter earnings call, announcing results that trailed Wall Street’s revenue expectations. Revenue for Q3 was posted at $5.98 billion, falling short of the expected $6.24 billion, signaling softening consumer demand. However, Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) narrowly beat profit expectations, logging an EPS of $0.88. This was one cent higher than estimates and was powered by company-wide expense discipline. Shares have fallen 4% since these results, but analysts remain bullish on the stock and have a consensus BUY rating, with a median share price upside potential of 10.3%. They believe that a soft landing for the economy with Fed cuts is likely to boost consumer spending in the months ahead. ARK Invest has the largest stake in the company, valued at over $444 million, as of September 30, 2024. The investment represents 4.06% of ARK’s portfolio, making Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) one of the top picks from the ARK Invest stock portfolio. Overall SQ ranks 5th among the ARK Invest's top Stock Picks for 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of SQ as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than SQ but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

The stock has gained 41% since the announcement of financial results for the third quarter of 2024 on November 4. Revenue for the quarter was posted at $726 million, up 30% year-over-year and 7% compared to Q2 2024, driven by a surge in demand for artificial intelligence, with customer count growing 39% from last year. In a letter to shareholders on the same day, CEO Alex Karp pointed out the speed of adoption of its platforms and AI capabilities by institutions in the U.S. being a major driver behind Palantir Technologies Inc. (NYSE:PLTR)’s growth. U.S. revenue grew 44% from last year to a total of $499 million for the quarter, of which 64% came from the U.S. government customer base, with the remaining being commercial revenue.

Title: Oddity Tech Ltd. (ODD): A Bull Case Theory
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oddity-tech-ltd-odd-bull-220700563.html
Time Published: 2024-11-17T22:07:00Z

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We came across a bullish thesis on Oddity Tech Ltd. (ODD) on Substack by Lorenzo Bastianelli. In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on ODD. Oddity Tech Ltd. (ODD)'s share was trading at $45.70 as of Nov 12th. ODD’s trailing P/E was 28.04 according to Yahoo Finance. A data analyst using cutting-edge analytics to accurately interpret complex sets of data. Oddity Tech's recent performance has garnered attention, with the stock surging 20% in the week following its November 7 earnings release, signaling that the market may finally be recognizing its potential. The company reported strong third-quarter results for the period ending September 30, 2024, exceeding its financial guidance across all key metrics. Net revenue reached a record $119 million, reflecting a 26% year-over-year increase, well above its targeted 20% growth. The company also demonstrated an increase in free cash flow per share, a positive indicator for future stock performance. Repeat purchases from loyal customers continued to grow, now accounting for over 50% of revenue, even as the company expanded by more than 25%. Looking ahead, Oddity is primed for further growth. The company is set to launch two new brands in the second half of 2025—Brand 3, a telehealth platform for skin and body concerns, and Brand 4, which will also cater to its existing customer base. CEO Oran Holtzman shared insights into the progress of Brand 3, including the establishment of a telehealth infrastructure, a physician and pharmacist network, and large-scale consumer studies for testing new products and treatments. This direct-to-consumer platform, coupled with the use of generative AI in treatment planning, is expected to further enhance customer satisfaction and drive growth. Holtzman also highlighted the strategic importance of Oddity Lab, which now boasts 60 scientists and a newly expanded facility in Kendall Square, Boston. This investment in research and development underscores Oddity's ambition to become one of the largest beauty companies globally. Despite some concerns about the lack of transparency around key performance indicators, the company’s promising financial results and ambitious growth strategy position it for continued success. Oddity’s stock remains undervalued, priced as though it’s in a worst-case scenario, offering investors significant upside potential. Oddity presents a compelling investment opportunity, with strong consumer loyalty, a promising pipeline of new brands, and an expanding scientific team positioning the company for sustained growth. The recent surge in the stock price, combined with a high short interest of 32.29% as of mid-October, indicates that there could still be significant upside potential. When a stock with high short interest performs well, it can trigger a "short squeeze," forcing short sellers to buy back shares to cover their positions, further driving the price higher. This mix of solid earnings and elevated short interest suggests that the stock may continue to rise as market sentiment shifts and adjusts to the company’s strong fundamentals. Oddity Tech Ltd. (ODD) is not on our list of the 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 21 hedge fund portfolios held ODD at the end of the second quarter which was 23 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the risk and potential of ODD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than ODD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Amplify Energy Corp. (AMPY): A Bull Case Theory

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We came across a bullish thesis on Amplify Energy Corp. (AMPY) on Substack by Idea Hive. In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on AMPY. Amplify Energy Corp. (AMPY)'s stock was trading at $6.74 as of Nov 12th. AMPY’s trailing and forward P/E were 4.35 and 5.48 respectively according to Yahoo Finance. A drilling rig fueled by the energy and expertise of the oil & gas exploration and production company. Amplify Energy (AMPY) continues to present a compelling investment opportunity within the energy sector, trading at undemanding multiples of approximately 4x 2024E EBITDA and 8x FCF. These multiples reflect the company’s solid cash generation from its low-decline, long-reserve-life oil and gas assets, especially as it ramps up development at its Beta oilfield. The Beta development is particularly promising, with the potential for substantial value creation as AMPY drills new wells and further expands its output. Recently, AMPY reported positive progress on this front, with the second well drilled in Q2 exceeding expectations, achieving production rates of 500 bpd, well above the company’s initial guidance. The third well drilled in Q3 also produced impressive results, with a 30-day production rate of 590 bpd, significantly higher than the initial forecast of 350 bpd. The well’s capital expenditure was in line with projections, and management expects it to pay out within 6 to 9 months, highlighting the strong economics of the Beta asset. With a new well expected to come online in mid-November, AMPY’s ability to scale the Beta development looks promising, with further updates expected in Q1 2025. Operationally, AMPY delivered another strong quarter, maintaining steady production and ample free cash flow. However, the company’s decision to retain its Bairoil asset, after evaluating various proposals, reflects the challenges in the crude oil market and the volatility in pricing. While a divestiture would have been ideal for reducing debt and potentially initiating a large capital return, AMPY’s management has indicated that they are open to future transactions if market conditions improve. Despite this setback, AMPY remains focused on its core assets, particularly Beta, which is key to its growth. From a valuation perspective, AMPY’s stock remains attractive. The market currently ascribes minimal value to the Beta asset, pricing it at around $66 million based on current multiples. However, given the successful drilling results and strong cash flow potential of Beta, this figure seems conservative. In fact, modeling Beta’s potential cash flow generation, including a more optimistic production scenario, suggests that the asset could generate up to $280 million in free cash flow over the next four years, potentially representing 70% of AMPY’s current enterprise value. As the market becomes more aware of Beta’s value, AMPY is likely to experience a re-rating, particularly as management updates its reserve figures by year-end. Given the continued success of Beta and the company’s overall solid performance, AMPY remains an attractive investment. Amplify Energy Corp. (AMPY) is also not on our list of the 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 13 hedge fund portfolios held AMPY at the end of the second quarter which was 18 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the risk and potential of AMPY as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Title: APi Group Corporation (APG): A Bull Case Theory

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We came across a bullish thesis on APi Group Corporation (APG) on Substack by Kairos research. In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on APG. APi Group Corporation (APG)'s share was trading at $36.96 as of Nov 12th. APG’s forward P/E was 17.61 according to Yahoo Finance. A technician meticulously inspecting a corrosion-resistant insulation panel for a fire-protection system. API Group, a leader in industrial services, has carved a strong niche in fire safety, primarily through targeted acquisitions and a strategic shift towards recurring, inspection-led revenue. Over the past decades, API has built a portfolio of around 100 niche businesses, primarily fire safety providers, which align with its recession-resistant model grounded in regulatory mandates, such as those from the National Fire Protection Association. This core fire safety segment contributes 70% of revenue, driven by recurring, high-margin inspections and monitoring services. Rather than pursuing large, cyclical contracts for new installations, API’s sales force focuses on winning recurring inspection services for existing buildings. This inspection-led approach not only secures ongoing revenue but also uncovers compliance issues that lead to additional services, offering a substantial revenue multiplier. For each dollar earned through inspections, API often generates an additional three to four dollars in follow-up services, all at a higher margin, which strengthens its bottom line. This model also allows API to selectively target high-margin specialty projects, further enhancing profitability. Since going public in 2020, API has pursued an aggressive acquisition strategy, completing 25 acquisitions to bolster its fire safety portfolio. A recent high-profile purchase of Chubb, acquired at a premium valuation of 14x EBITDA, underscored API’s commitment to expanding its safety services. Typically, API seeks acquisitions with strong cultural fit and synergy potential, paying disciplined valuations in the 4x to 7x EBITDA range. By transitioning newly acquired businesses to its inspection-focused model, API optimizes margin performance across its portfolio. The company targets an EBITDA margin of 13% by 2025, with potential to expand to 15%, driven by recurring revenues that now make up 53% of sales. API aims for 10% organic growth in its inspection segment, with some investors advocating a divestment of its lower-margin specialty segment to concentrate on high-margin safety services. API's capital allocation strategies reflect its focus on quality revenue. The company has actively divested cyclical assets and lower-margin clients, creating a leaner revenue mix centered around high-margin fire safety. This approach has led to incremental margin gains, and with leverage reduced to a 2.4x net ratio, API has initiated a $1 billion share repurchase program, with $400 million still available. Despite a seemingly low return on invested capital (ROIC) due to goodwill and debt, API’s adjusted ROIC is closer to 7% and could improve as the safety segment grows. The company’s parallels with high-margin peers like Otis Worldwide and TopBuild suggest the potential for ROIC in the 10-20% range if capital allocation remains disciplined. Risks to API’s growth include regulatory shifts in fire safety codes, which could affect inspection demand, although regulatory tightening is more probable than loosening. Cyclical pressures in the specialty services segment, which remains economically sensitive, may mask API’s underlying fundamentals. The Chubb acquisition offers growth potential but underscores the importance of prudent integration to avoid value erosion. Valuation projections indicate that the safety segment will continue to outpace specialty services, likely accounting for 81-83% of revenue by 2030, driven by bolt-on acquisitions and organic demand. Maintaining net debt below 2.5x EBITDA remains a priority as API balances growth with financial stability. With an 18% upside, API offers compelling long-term returns, provided it maintains growth in its asset-light safety business. If API succeeds in sustaining demand for inspections and focusing on high-margin services, the company is well-positioned to deliver attractive returns for investors. APi Group Corporation (APG) is not on our list of the 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 52 hedge fund portfolios held APG at the end of the second quarter which was 39 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the risk and potential of APG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Best Nuclear Energy Stocks To Invest In Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) stands against other best nuclear energy stocks to invest in now. According to the September updated edition of the report, “Pathways to Commercial Liftoff Advanced Nuclear” by the US Department of Energy (DOE), the U.S. nuclear power sector is set to triple in capacity from approximately 100 GW in 2024 to around 300 GW by 2050, driven by increased electricity demand and the need for reliable, carbon-free power. Recent demand surges from artificial intelligence and data centers are encouraging significant investment in nuclear power. Nuclear also plays a vital role in the energy transition, the United States power systems require an additional 700–900 GW of clean firm capacity to achieve net-zero emissions. The current nuclear fleet, comprising 94 reactors across 54 sites, provides about 20% of the nation’s electricity and nearly half of its carbon-free power. To support nuclear expansion, the U.S. government has bolstered the sector with tax credits, loans, and research funding. The Inflation Reduction Act’s (IRA) production and investment tax credits for new reactors and existing plants are expected to play a pivotal role. In 2024, Congress provided a $2.72 billion allocation for developing a domestic nuclear fuel supply chain and passed the ADVANCE Act to improve licensing process efficiency. Congress also allocated $900 million specifically for Gen III+ Small modular reactors (SMRs). Small modular reactors (SMRs) are an alternative to traditional nuclear plants and offer a promising new opportunity for nuclear energy. SMRs are a type of nuclear reactor with a power capacity of up to 300 MW(e) per unit. They are manufactured off-site and shipped to the location for installation, making them more cost-effective and suitable for a wider range of areas. In an interview with Yahoo Finance on October 1, Aniket Shah, Global Head of Sustainability and Transition Strategy at Jefferies, discussed the resurgence of nuclear power in the United States, particularly in Michigan and Pennsylvania, where plants are set to reopen to support the growing demand for electricity driven by the AI boom. Shah emphasized that this development is not surprising, given the long-known need for increased power demand and the role of nuclear energy in the energy transition. Shah highlighted that the International Energy Agency’s long-term forecast has consistently shown the need to double or triple global nuclear capacity to achieve net-zero emissions. He also pointed out that the US signed an agreement at the Conference of the Parties (COP) nine months ago to triple nuclear capacity over the next couple of decades. Shah attributed the recent momentum in nuclear energy to the growing demand from the tech industry, which is willing to pay a premium for firm and clean power to meet their climate commitments. Shah noted that Big Tech companies will play a significant role in driving the nuclear renaissance, not only by investing in nuclear power but also in small modular reactors and potentially nuclear fusion. He also emphasized the bipartisan support for nuclear energy in the US, citing the passage of the ADVANCE Act to streamline nuclear approvals and the willingness of politicians from both parties to support nuclear energy. However, Shah acknowledged that the industry faces significant challenges, including a lack of skills and capacity to deliver on the required scale, and that the process of building a new industry will take time. The tech industry’s demand for energy is driving a surprising trend as big tech companies are increasingly turning to nuclear power to fuel their operations. As demand for clean electricity grows, tech companies are recognizing its potential to provide a reliable, low-carbon source of power for their data centers and AI operations. With that in context, let’s take a look at the 10 best nuclear energy stocks to invest in now. To compile our list of the 10 best nuclear energy stocks to invest in now, we scanned nuclear energy ETFs plus online rankings to compile an initial list of 25 nuclear energy stocks. From that list, we narrowed our choices to the 10 stocks that analysts see the most upside to. The list is sorted in ascending order of analysts’ average upside potential, as of November 12. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

(NYSE:NEE) is one of the largest producers of renewable energy and a leading player in the nuclear energy industry, operating one of the largest nuclear power fleets in the United States. NextEra Energy, Inc.’s (NYSE:NEE) nuclear facilities in Wisconsin and New Hampshire, include the Point Beach Nuclear Energy Center and Seabrook Station. The company’s Point Beach facility in Wisconsin produces about 1,200 megawatts of power, which is around one-sixth of Florida’s electricity. Whereas, Seabrook Station generates over 1,250 megawatts of electricity. NextEra Energy, Inc.’s (NYSE:NEE) Duane Arnold Energy Center, Iowa’s only nuclear power plant, located northeast of Palo, Iowa ceased operations in August 2020 after serving for 45 years. In Q3, NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) announced that the company is considering restarting Duane Arnold nuclear plant in response to increasing demand from data centers. During the Q3 earnings call, John Ketchum, Chairman, President, and CEO of NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE), noted that Duane Arnold, a 601 MW boiling water reactor (BWR), is generally less complex and costly to recommission than pressurized water reactors (PWRs). The company expects to pursue this project at an attractive cost with minimal risk. NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) is currently conducting engineering assessments and coordinating with the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission on a possible restart due to significant interest from data center clients. Overall, NEE ranks 6th on our list of best nuclear energy stocks to invest in now. While we acknowledge the potential of NEE to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Title: AIL round-up: St Mary’s strike late to hold Cork Con to draw as Ballynahinch march on

Newly-promoted St Mary’s underlined their play-off credentials with a hard-earned 27-27 draw away to the champions Cork Con, which maintained their record of gleaning at least two points from each of their seven games this season and kept them in second place. Con gained an additional bonus point. Thepick of their tries came from the returning Billy Crowley and was created by Eoghan Smyth’s lovely left-to-right pass as the former Midleton player continues to impress. But St Mary’s drew level through a late try by 36-year-old prop Andy Keating. “This is the most competitive league I’ve known in all my time involved in the club game,” said Con’s Brian Hickey, “and a very, very good standard in my opinion.” Leaders Ballynahinch recorded their fifth bonus-point win in succession since losing 51-21 in Temple Hill. Their latest victory was a 24-19 home triumph over UCD, earned thanks to tries by winger Ethan Graham, hooker Claytan Milligan (two) and George Pringle, with conversions by James Humphreys and Conor Rankin. As UCD were bulk suppliers to Leinster A’s 28-7 win over the Connacht Eagles, this was a creditable bonus point for them. UCD’s tries were scored by Bobby Sheehan, who captained the side, Mark Canniffe and Oisin Spain. Lansdowne will be buoyed by a badly needed 26-17 win over Clontarf on the Aviva back pitch. It came courtesy of a brace of tries by their ever-dependable, go-to centre Andy Marks and one by flanker Paul Wilson. Terenure returned to winning ways and remained in the top four in an entertaining 42-26 win over Garryowen at Lakelands Park. The home side started strongly and had a bonus point by the 50th minute thanks to ex-Ospreys flanker Will Hickey, who made an impressive first start, Adam La Grue, Adam Melia and a penalty try. But Garryowen kept bouncing back. Winger Colm Quilligan scored off a long pass by Tom Wood, and a rampaging run by number eight Brian Gleeson. When a penalty try of their own was augmented by lock Finn McCall, who recently won a Meades Cup medal with Thames Valley, that made it 32-26 inside the last 10 minutes But a penalty by Aran Egan and a slaloming finish by Conor Phillips sealed a Terenure win that was tarnished by Marcus Hanan and Harrison Brewer being helped off. Old Belvedere continued to set a hot pace in 1B with a 43-24 win in Queen’s, although Nenagh Ormond’s 42-15 win away to Shannon underlined a shift in the balance of power between those two. The 2A leaders, Corinthians, suffered their first defeat of the campaign but, despite missing eight players with the Eagles, achieved two bonus points in a 41-39 defeat at home to Cashel. Instonians and Greystones ensured one point covered the top three by scoring 19 tries between them in 61-29 and 71-8 wins at home to Barnhall and Buccaneers.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Best Nuclear Energy Stocks To Invest In Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where DTE Energy Company (NYSE:DTE) stands against other best nuclear energy stocks to invest in now. According to the September updated edition of the report, “Pathways to Commercial Liftoff Advanced Nuclear” by the US Department of Energy (DOE), the U.S. nuclear power sector is set to triple in capacity from approximately 100 GW in 2024 to around 300 GW by 2050, driven by increased electricity demand and the need for reliable, carbon-free power. Recent demand surges from artificial intelligence and data centers are encouraging significant investment in nuclear power. Nuclear also plays a vital role in the energy transition, the United States power systems require an additional 700–900 GW of clean firm capacity to achieve net-zero emissions. The current nuclear fleet, comprising 94 reactors across 54 sites, provides about 20% of the nation’s electricity and nearly half of its carbon-free power. To support nuclear expansion, the U.S. government has bolstered the sector with tax credits, loans, and research funding. The Inflation Reduction Act’s (IRA) production and investment tax credits for new reactors and existing plants are expected to play a pivotal role. In 2024, Congress provided a $2.72 billion allocation for developing a domestic nuclear fuel supply chain and passed the ADVANCE Act to improve licensing process efficiency. Congress also allocated $900 million specifically for Gen III+ Small modular reactors (SMRs). Small modular reactors (SMRs) are an alternative to traditional nuclear plants and offer a promising new opportunity for nuclear energy. SMRs are a type of nuclear reactor with a power capacity of up to 300 MW(e) per unit. They are manufactured off-site and shipped to the location for installation, making them more cost-effective and suitable for a wider range of areas. In an interview with Yahoo Finance on October 1, Aniket Shah, Global Head of Sustainability and Transition Strategy at Jefferies, discussed the resurgence of nuclear power in the United States, particularly in Michigan and Pennsylvania, where plants are set to reopen to support the growing demand for electricity driven by the AI boom. Shah emphasized that this development is not surprising, given the long-known need for increased power demand and the role of nuclear energy in the energy transition. Shah highlighted that the International Energy Agency’s long-term forecast has consistently shown the need to double or triple global nuclear capacity to achieve net-zero emissions. He also pointed out that the US signed an agreement at the Conference of the Parties (COP) nine months ago to triple nuclear capacity over the next couple of decades. Shah attributed the recent momentum in nuclear energy to the growing demand from the tech industry, which is willing to pay a premium for firm and clean power to meet their climate commitments. Shah noted that Big Tech companies will play a significant role in driving the nuclear renaissance, not only by investing in nuclear power but also in small modular reactors and potentially nuclear fusion. He also emphasized the bipartisan support for nuclear energy in the US, citing the passage of the ADVANCE Act to streamline nuclear approvals and the willingness of politicians from both parties to support nuclear energy. However, Shah acknowledged that the industry faces significant challenges, including a lack of skills and capacity to deliver on the required scale, and that the process of building a new industry will take time. The tech industry’s demand for energy is driving a surprising trend as big tech companies are increasingly turning to nuclear power to fuel their operations. As demand for clean electricity grows, tech companies are recognizing its potential to provide a reliable, low-carbon source of power for their data centers and AI operations. With that in context, let’s take a look at the 10 best nuclear energy stocks to invest in now. To compile our list of the 10 best nuclear energy stocks to invest in now, we scanned nuclear energy ETFs plus online rankings to compile an initial list of 25 nuclear energy stocks. From that list, we narrowed our choices to the 10 stocks that analysts see the most upside to. The list is sorted in ascending order of analysts’ average upside potential, as of November 12. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). An aerial view of a power plant surrounded by majestic rolling hills. Upside Potential: 13.91% DTE Energy Company (NYSE:DTE) is a diversified energy company involved in the development and management of energy-related businesses including nuclear power plants. The company’s electric segment serves 2.3 million customers in Southeast Michigan with an 11,084-megawatt system capacity, whereas the natural gas segment serves 1.3 million customers in Michigan. DTE Energy Company’s (NYSE:DTE) Fermi 2 nuclear power plant produces around 1,100 megawatts and electricity and represents 30% of Michigan’s total nuclear generation capacity. The Fermi 2 nuclear power plant is known as one of the best-performing nuclear facilities in the United States. On October 24, DTE Energy Company (NYSE:DTE) reported its third quarter 2024 earnings for the three months ended on September 30. The company reported earnings of $477 million compared to $332 million for the same period last year. The company invested over $3 billion so far this year and is on track to invest over $4 billion in 2024. This investment will not only improve electric reliability but also transform its power generation. Furthermore, DTE Energy Company (NYSE:DTE) is investing in smart grid technology and new substations that will improve electric reliability and reduce costs in the long run. This operational efficiency will enable the company to maintain a competitive edge in the market. Overall, DTE ranks 8th on our list of best nuclear energy stocks to invest in now. While we acknowledge the potential of DTE to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than DTE but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Who Really Profits From The Ukraine War?

Time Published: 2024-11-17T17:45:37Z

November 18, 2024 Authored by Jim Quinn via The Burning Platform blog Few people understand what the war in Ukraine means for big business – namely, opportunity. It’s not just the weapons and reconstruction contracts. Ukraine’s vast agricultural lands – among the most fertile in the world – are up for grabs, and American companies like BlackRock are at the front of the line. RFK Jr. Deftly and clearly explains. JP Morgan and BlackRock — From Financiers of Destruction to Half-Trillion Dollar ‘Heroes’ of Reconstruction – The Hypocrisy of Reconstruction of Ukraine by the Same Corporations that Profited from the War JP Morgan and BlackRock, along with consultancy McKinsey & Company, are collaborating with the Ukrainian government to establish a reconstruction fund. The objective of this fund is to attract significant investments for the country’s reconstruction, which could cost between $400 billion and $1 trillion, depending on estimates. This fund, known as the Fund for the Development of Ukraine, will use a “blended finance” approach to mobilize both public and private capital, targeting priority sectors such as infrastructure, climate and agriculture. BlackRock and JP Morgan offered their services pro bono to manage this fund, leveraging their expertise in financial markets and debt management. The intention is that this fund can begin to operate fully once the war ends, although planning is already underway and has been discussed at recent international conferences. The recent partnership between JP Morgan, BlackRock and McKinsey & Company to rebuild Ukraine highlights the bitter irony of the current geopolitical situation. In a deal that aims to raise hundreds of billions of dollars for the reconstruction of war-torn Ukraine, these American financial giants now position themselves as the economic saviors of a country whose destruction, in part, was facilitated by policies and actions in financial markets that they themselves dominated and shaped. The United States, through its foreign policies and interventions, has a long history of fomenting instability in various regions of the world. In the case of Ukraine, the situation is no different. From the beginning of the Ukrainian crisis, American interests were clear: to weaken Russia and expand the Western sphere of influence. The irony becomes even more evident when we consider that many of the same financial institutions now being called upon to rebuild Ukraine are those that have profited immensely from armed conflicts and the destabilization of global markets. JP Morgan and BlackRock are entities deeply rooted in the global financial system, and both have a history of financing military industries and governments that perpetuate conflict. JP Morgan, for example, has a long history of involvement in financing wars and authoritarian regimes around the world. BlackRock, in turn, as the largest asset manager in the world, has stakes in practically all major defense companies, which profit directly from the manufacture of weapons used in conflicts such as Ukraine. This dichotomy is alarming: the same institutions that financed destruction are now celebrated as leaders of reconstruction. The “fund of reconstruction” proposed for Ukraine is not just a humanitarian effort; it is also a strategic maneuver to ensure that Western capital has control over the country’s future assets and economic infrastructure. The reconstruction of Ukraine, costing up to a trillion dollars, presents a lucrative opportunity for these companies, which are now seen as saviors. Furthermore, McKinsey & Company’s presence on the project adds an additional layer of criticism, as the consulting firm has frequently been accused of unethical practices and collusion with corrupt regimes. McKinsey’s lack of transparency and controversial practices call into question the integrity of the reconstruction process. Sourced from ZeroHedge Become a Patron!

Title: Ann-Marie McGlynn and Keelan Kilrehill prove a class apart to claim national cross country titles

Keelan Kilrehill of Moy Valley AC, Mayo, cannot believe he is about to win the senior men's race at the Cross Country Championships at Castle Irvine Estate in Irvinestown, Fermanagh. Photo: Ramsey Cardy/Sportsfile For Ann-Marie McGlynn and Keelan Kilrehill, this afternoon’s 123.ie National Cross Country Championships served up the chance to write their own pieces of Irish athletics history. The pair proved a class apart in the senior races over 7,500m at the Castle Irvine Estate in Fermanagh, with McGlynn winning the women’s title by 11 seconds and Kilrehill the men’s by a whopping 28 seconds. McGlynn, a Tullamore native running for Letterkenny AC, became the first athlete to win the national marathon and cross country titles in the same year, the 44-year-old’s victory coming just three weeks after she clocked a 2:34:05 marathon in Dublin. “It just shows it can be done,” she said. “I can’t believe it. I’m not going to lie: it wasn’t even in the plan. I went to the Dublin Marathon and I suppose I didn’t have to go to the well and I came off it in great nick. I wasn’t sore. I took a full week off, no running, then called the club the week after and said, ‘Let’s go to the nationals.’” She hit the line in 27:05, 11 seconds clear of Niamh Allen, who led Leevale to the team title, with Tullamore’s Danielle Donegan taking bronze. The U-23 title went to Dundrum South Dublin’s Emma McEvoy, who finished eighth overall. McGlynn’s goal had been solely to help Letterkenny qualify for the European Clubs Cross Country but now she will lead the Irish team at next month’s European Cross Country in Antalya, Turkey. “I’ve done very little the last three weeks but I’m very fit so just have to tap into that wee bit of speed,” she said. “My strength probably paid off in the end as it was a tough, honest course – a workhorse course. You just had to grind it out and I’m very good at grinding it out. It was just my day.” Kilrehill (24) became the first man from a Connacht club to win the title for 111 years, the Sligo native giving Moy Valley AC one of their finest days after a devastating last two laps. Niall Murphy of Ennis Track claimed the U-23 title in second, just ahead of last year’s senior champion Cormac Dalton in third. “The minute I saw Efrem [Gidey] make a move and go to the front, I felt like I was so concentrated and ready for it,” said Kilrehill. “I went with him straight away and then when I felt like he wasn’t pushing on like I wanted, I was like, ‘Why not me? Why not have a go at this?’ “I ran with so much confidence, I was so proud of the way I ran it. It’s that one title I can’t finish athletics without, the one I’ve dreamt of and to win it like that, it’s unreal.” Gidey finished fourth while rising star Nick Griggs faded to seventh, the 19-year-old nonetheless assured of his place on the U-23 team for the Europeans and leading the Candour Track Club to victory in the team event. UCD’s Jonas Stafford showed all his class to claim the U-20 men’s title with a powerful last lap, coming home six seconds clear of Lagan Valley’s Frank McGrath, while Lucy Foster of Willowfield Harriers was a dominant winner of the U-20 women’s race, clocking 15:43 ahead of Annabel Morrison (16:04).

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We came across a bullish thesis on monday.com Ltd. (MNDY) on Rijnberk InvestInsights’ Substack by Daan Rijnberk. In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on MNDY. monday.com Ltd. (MNDY)'s share was trading at $268.90 as of Nov 14th. MNDY’s trailing and forward P/E were 625.35 and 68.97 respectively according to Yahoo Finance. A tech savvy businessperson working on multiple devices, utilizing the company's cloud-based platform. Monday.com recently experienced a significant stock price drop despite a strong third-quarter performance that beat expectations on revenue and earnings. Contrary to typical reasons for such a decline, Monday’s results were solid—management is effectively driving growth, expanding margins, and increasing retention rates. The company exceeded Wall Street's top- and bottom-line estimates and even raised its full-year 2024 guidance. Yet, shares fell by 20% in just two days due to an elevated pre-earnings valuation of 93x earnings and 16x sales, which set high market expectations that couldn’t be met without an extraordinary outperformance. Thus, despite its operational success, Monday’s stock price retracted to August levels, around $270 per share, just above the $250 range previously identified as a buying opportunity. The fundamentals of Monday.com remain strong, with the company’s Q3 performance reinforcing confidence in its growth and profitability. Its low-code, no-code Work OS platform, which allows users to build custom work management solutions, continues to gain popularity. Since launching as a collaboration tool in 2014, Monday has expanded into other enterprise software areas, including CRM, human resources, and software development, allowing it to serve a diverse range of businesses. With a growth rate averaging 35% over the last three years and a 30% free cash flow (FCF) margin, Monday.com has established itself as a high-performing SaaS company worthy of its premium valuation. In its latest results, Monday reported Q3 revenue of $251 million, marking a 33% year-over-year increase. Demand remained strong, with limited slowdown despite industry-wide budget constraints. The company’s net retention rate climbed to 111%, up from 110%, driven by improved retention across both small and large customers. Monday’s strategy of expanding within its existing customer base through cross-selling and upselling has been key to sustaining growth. For instance, Monday’s second-largest client recently doubled its seat count, highlighting the effectiveness of its land-and-expand approach. By initially securing smaller deals and gradually offering additional products or upgrades, Monday maximizes revenue potential from each customer, expanding its footprint with both new and existing clients. The company’s dual growth engines—adding new customers and increasing revenue per existing user—are yielding positive results. Large customer accounts are growing faster than the company’s revenue, up 40% in Q3, as major clients continue to adopt more seats and products. This focus on innovation has seen Monday introduce new offerings within its platform each quarter, bolstering its ability to meet evolving business needs. Management expressed confidence in Monday’s role in shaping the future of work by continuously investing in new technologies and expanding its product suite. Currently, Monday is enhancing its AI capabilities with no-code AI features that allow customers to create tailored applications. Although still in beta, these AI features saw rapid adoption between Q2 and Q3, with usage increasing by 150%, underscoring a strong growth area that is likely to provide additional revenue streams. Beyond innovation, Monday’s efficient platform architecture gives it an edge in cost-effective product development, with multiple software stacks sharing a common core on its Work OS platform. This shared structure has enabled Monday to launch new solutions quickly and with minimal resources while maintaining high levels of customizability, a feature highly valued by users. Upcoming releases, such as Monday Service, are expected to attract further adoption and deepen existing client relationships, reflecting the platform’s continued evolution and Monday’s capacity to respond to shifting market demands. Financially, Monday has been making impressive strides in margin expansion. The company maintained a gross margin of 90% last quarter, surpassing its long-term target. Operating and net margins have also grown, although they recently plateaued as Monday increased R&D spending. This slight dip, however, is viewed positively as it reflects investment in new product development, which aligns with the company’s long-term growth objectives. Ultimately, Monday.com’s robust performance and sustained innovation affirm its premium valuation and status as a leader in the SaaS market. While the recent stock drop highlights market volatility, it does not reflect any fundamental issues with the business, making this an intriguing entry point for long-term investors. monday.com Ltd. (MNDY) is not on our list of the 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 43 hedge fund portfolios held MNDY at the end of the second quarter which was 46 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the risk and potential of MNDY as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Title: Gold Loses Some Luster After Trump’s Decisive Win

(Bloomberg) -- Donald Trump’s victory immediately buoyed markets from stocks to Bitcoin. Gold is going to take a lot longer to turn things around. Most Read from Bloomberg Saudi Neom Gets $3 Billion Loan Guarantee From Italy Export Credit Agency Sace The Urban-Rural Divide Over Highway Expansion and Emissions In the two days immediately following the Republican candidate’s win, the precious metal’s performance was the worst in at least 13 US presidential election windows, according to Deutsche Bank. Gold prices have dropped almost 7% since Election Day, even as several other asset classes enjoy a post-campaign boost. “When people get really interested in gold is when nothing else is working,” said Rob Haworth, senior investment strategy director at US Bank. “Equities are working well; you’re even seeing solid returns for low-quality corporate credit. So you’re less likely to seek out alternative sources of portfolio growth.” Related: Your Guide to Trump’s Day-One Agenda, From Taxes to Tariffs Gold’s slide is a marked turnaround for a commodity that had surged by more than 30% in the year leading up to the US vote, hitting record after record as geopolitical and economic risk drew investors in. Although longer-term uncertainty remains in place, with Trump known for his at-times wildcard positions, much of gold’s safe-haven appeal apparated after the most bullish scenario for gold — a contested election — failed to materialize. A rallying dollar in the days since Trump’s re-election is also negative for bullion as it’s priced in the US currency. At the same time, the US economy appears to be in pretty good shape, with inflation easing and the Federal Reserve not in a rush to keep lowering interest rates. With the rest of the US economy looking so strong right now, “gold would be a contrarian call,” said Matt Miskin, co-chief investment strategist at John Hancock Investment Management. “The sentiment right now is there’s very little risk, whether it’s fundamentally, geopolitically. These types of environments, it’s not easy to go against momentum.” Some investors may not personally agree with the President-elect’s platform, but just knowing what to expect during Trump 2.0 has helped remove some of the recent uncertainty that helped propel the precious metal to new highs. The confirmation of a Republican clean sweep also means there’ll be more leeway to carry out the policies he telegraphed on the campaign trail. Trump’s agenda, ranging from tax cuts to financial deregulation to tariffs, has hedge funds piling into sectors that could benefit, including large-cap banks and domestic industrials. “We just have more compelling places to put capital” than gold, said Jay Hatfield, chief executive officer of Infrastructure Capital Advisors, citing opportunities in financials and other riskier assets. “Who wants to miss the 10% rally in Goldman Sachs?” Cryptocurrencies have also surged since Election Day amid expectations that Trump’s policies will boost digital assets. Total assets of iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF, BlackRock Inc.’s spot-Bitcoin ETF, surpassed $40 billion for the first time this past week. That surge coincided with a sharp outflow in SPDR Gold Shares, the world’s largest physically-backed gold ETF. “With a Trump win, one key implication is that we’re likely to see less regulation on cryptocurrencies. That should pull at least some capital away from gold; that pocket of demand that’s speculative may very well move to cryptos now,” said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist for Invesco Advisers. Still, gold may still have some room to run longer term. Trump’s hardline pledges on taxes and tariffs are likely to eventually result in higher deficits and inflation, which could trigger the return to buying gold as an inflationary hedge. If a second Trump term disrupts global trade and geopolitics, it may also prompt central banks such as those in China and Russia to continue to buy gold to diversify away from the dollar-reserve system. “A lot of reserve managers of ‘friends’ and ‘neutral-ish’ countries, they’re going to be a little bit more worried about a more erratic foreign policy and implications on the safety of their reserves,” said Rajeev De Mello, global macro portfolio manager at Gama Asset Management SA. The current selloff is “a buy-the-dip story more than anything else,” he added. “After the sharp decline since the US elections, gold has entered a more affordable range.” Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek FedEx’s CEO Is Charting His Own Path—in the Smith Family’s Shadow Political Ads Can’t Buy the Presidency CEOs Brace for the Chaos of Another Four Years of Trump Martha Stewart’s Empire Monetized More Than Just Domesticity Elon Musk Has a New Project to Run: Trump’s Government ©2024 Bloomberg L.P.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 7 Best Department Store Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Macy's, Inc. (NYSE:M) stands against the other department store stocks. With the holiday season approaching, discussions and concerns about expected consumer spending are increasing. According to Deloitte's annual holiday survey, shoppers are feeling more optimistic despite concerns about inflation, and are planning to increase their holiday spending by 8% year over year. On October 19, Brian McCarthy, Principal of Retail Strategy and Transformation at Deloitte, joined Brad Smith on Yahoo Finance's Wealth! to discuss what he calls an expected record-breaking shopping season. As per Deloitte's latest holiday retail survey, consumers are planning to spend more money in this year's holiday season, primarily due to a "rosier economic outlook." He says that we are seeing a 9 percentage point increase in positivity towards the economy's future. In addition, the overall consumer perception of higher prices is also a factor, with around 70% of shoppers believing that their prices for gifts in 2024 will be higher than in 2023. Retail executives are also optimistic about the upcoming season, with 80% expecting to see stronger sales both online and in brick-and-mortar. As per the survey, consumers plan to spend a record-high average of around $1,778 this year, with the average consumer spending experiencing an 8% increase from the 2023 survey. These trends are expected to emerge despite the inflationary and price pressures that some consumers have cited. McCarthy told Yahoo Finance: "We're seeing after this year of frugality and restraint, consumers are feeling a bit more optimistic about the economy. They're planning to have a very festive holiday season." An interesting brand loyalty crisis is also emerging this holiday season. Consumers are looking for better prices and deals instead of going back to the brands they always shop at. They are looking for the best value and are generally inching away from brand loyalty, prioritizing quality and price over brand names and tags. According to McCarthy, consumers seek quality, value, and variety when they go holiday shopping. He says that: "With the perception of higher prices still top of mind, consumers are really caught between trying to stretch their wallets and being festive and so this really means they're torn between seeking value and remaining loyal." He further says that around two-thirds of consumers are expected to switch brands if they find the price too high, and around 50% are willing to switch retailers to save. In addition, 78% of shoppers plan to participate in promotional events this October and November. Trends also show that privately labeled brand sales are expected to grow faster than national brand sales this year. He suggests that retailers must ensure that they provide good quality, good value price points, and a variety of selection that attracts consumers. He also offers advice to consumers looking to save some dollars without slashing items from their holiday list, saying that: "Shoppers are encouraged to explore multiple retailers to look for a competitive deal or a price point that they think is going to work for them." He adds, "I have found AI is a really interesting thing to start asking for where you may find particular products or promotional deals so you can use technology to be a bit more savvy that way. We recently published an article on the 10 Cheap Retail Stocks to Buy According to Analysts. Here is an excerpt from the article: "According to the WTW Global Retail Survey for 2024, around 52% of retailers this year expect increased profitability in the coming two years. In addition, approximately 48% of retailers are looking to leverage artificial intelligence in their operations to offer their customers a personalized and efficient shopping experience. However, with more and more businesses turning towards AI, around 43% of the respondents voiced concerns about high cybersecurity risks likely to arise with increasing reliance on new technologies. Despite the risks, a majority of retailers are incorporating AI into their operations, streamlining and expediting their functioning".

Title: What happened in crypto this week
URL: https://coinjournal.net/news/what-happened-in-crypto-this-week-4/
Time Published: 2024-11-16T23:16:22Z
Full Content:
What a week it’s been with the crypto market: Bitcoin hits $93,000, FTX sues Binance and former CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao for $1.76 billion, BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF hits $40 billion, investors withdraw appeal in Dogecoin lawsuit against Elon Musk, and ‘Crypto Dad’ denies interest in becoming SEC chair. Let’s look at these and recap what happened this week in crypto. Bitcoin reached a record $93,000 earlier this week, partly due to Donald Trump’s victory in the US election at the beginning of November. At the beginning of the week, Bitcoin broke the $82,000 mark before pushing to $84,000 and then $87,000. While Trump’s win has helped push Bitcoin to new heights given his pro-crypto stance during his campaign that isn’t the sole reason behind the recent bull run. According to Jesse Myers, co-founder of Onramp Bitcoin, the main reason is that the crypto market is at the “6+ months post-halving mark.” In Myers’ opinion, “supply shock has accumulated,” meaning “there’s not enough supply available at current prices to satisfy demand,” adding that a “supply-demand price equilibrium must be restored.” Earlier this month, James Toldeano, COO of self-custody wallet Unity, said it was “disingenuous” to say that the US election results directly caused Bitcoin’s price rise. With Bitcoin reaching new heights, Matthew Sigel, head of Digital Assets Research at VanEck, forecasted that the current Bitcoin rally is in its early phases. Collapsed crypto exchange FTX filed a lawsuit against Binance and Changpeng Zhao over an alleged fraudulent transfer. According to a November 10 filing, Sam Bankman-Fried, FTX’s former co-founder and CEO, fraudulently transferred “at least $1.76 billion” to Binance and Binance executives in July 2021. In 2019, Binance acquired a 20% stake in FTX and in 2020, Binance acquired a further 18.4% in WRS, an umbrella company of Bankman-Fried based in the US. However, in July 2021, the two exchanges agreed on a deal that saw FTX buying back Binance and its executives’ entire stakes in FTX and WRS. This amounted to around $1.76 billion in FTX’s FTT token, BNB, and BUSD (Binance’s stablecoin) The filing states that the transfer was fraudulent because Alameda Research – FTX’s sister company, which funded the transfer – was insolvent at the time and couldn’t afford it. According to testimony from Caroline Ellison, former CEO of Alameda Research, Alameda spent around “$1 billion of FTX Trading’s capital received from depositors to fund the repurchase.” BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) hit a new record this week. In 211 days, it reached $40 billion in net assets. The record comes two weeks after it reached $30 billion in net assets in 293 days at the end of October. With BlackRock’s new achievement, it’s surpassed the previous record of 1,253 days held by iShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets ETF, according to Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas. Balchunas added that “[BlackRock’s] now in Top 1% of all ETFs by assets and at 10mo old it is bigger than all 2,800 ETFs launched in the past TEN years.” At the time of publishing, BlackRock holds more than 471,000 Bitcoin, valued at $42.8 billion, according to data from iShares. Investors who’d sued Elon Musk and his company Tesla for manipulating the cryptocurrency Dogecoin earlier this week withdrew their appeal. Filed by Dogecoin investors, the lawsuit, claimed that Musk had used his influential public platform to artificially inflate the price of Dogecoin for personal gain. As evidence of a pattern of market manipulation, the investors pointed to Musk’s tweets and public appearances. However, according to US District Judge Alvin Hellerstein – who dismissed the case – the investors couldn’t establish claims of securities fraud based solely on Musk’s public statements. The judge stated that Musk claiming Dogecoin was the “future currency of Earth” or could be “floated to the moon” by SpaceX were not credible grounds for claims of insider trading or fraud. Christopher Giancarlo, former CFTC chair, and known as ‘Crypto Dad’ has denied rumors that he’s being considered to replace Gary Gensler as chair of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In a post on X, Giancarlo, known as Crypto Dad, said: “I’ve made clear that I’ve already cleaned up [an] earlier Gary Gensler mess @CFTC and don’t want to have [to] do it again,” adding: “DC rumors that I’m interested in some #crypto role @USTreasury are also wrong.” Giancarlo served as a commissioner at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) between 2014 and 2019. In January 2017, he was designated as acting chair of the CFTC and in August 2017 he was confirmed to serve as the chair until 2019. Speculation over the future head of the SEC comes as Donald Trump promised to remove Gensler following his re-election to the White House earlier this month. Other possibilities for the role include Hester Peirce, an SEC commissioner, Paul Atkins, a former SEC commissioner, and Mark Uyeda, a current SEC commissioner.

Market Capitalization: $851 Billion Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) makes and sells integrated circuits and semiconductors. The shares of the company have been on a downward trend over the past few days despite recent reports that it had secured over $6.6 billion in funding through the CHIPS Act from the US government. Investor concerns around the incoming White House administration, which has taken several swipes at TSM during the campaign trail, are one of the major reasons behind this. Trump has asked companies to relocate advanced chip manufacturing to the United States several times over the past years. Overall, TSM ranks 6th on our list of AI news updates taking Wall Street by storm. While we acknowledge the potential of TSM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than TSM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Bitcoin Permabull Michael Saylor Believes BTC’s On Track To Hit $100K Before Year-End

Vigorous Bitcoin evangelist and MicroStrategy Executive Chairman Michael Saylor is more bullish than ever about the price of the premier cryptocurrency now that President-elect Donald Trump is set to take office in January. Saylor plans to have a New Year’s Eve party when BTC reaches the long-awaited $100,000 mark, which he expects by the end of this year. Speaking to CNBC on Thursday, MicroStrategy founder Michael Saylor forecasted that Bitcoin would hit the coveted $100,000 at some point in December. “The red wave is probably the biggest thing that’s happened in the past four years for Bitcoin,” Saylor opined. “But we’re also getting a lot of very constructive support from Wall Street. BlackRock has been a very, very strong voice articulating the Bitcoin value proposition.” The price of Bitcoin skyrocketed post-Donald Trump’s election victory on Nov. 6. The win heralds a potentially softer approach from regulators toward the crypto industry. Trump promised to make the U.S. the crypto capital of the planet and to fire current SEC chair Gary Gensler on day one of office. Soon, we’ll see whether and how he’ll deliver on those promises. Nevertheless, Saylor believes the President-elect is “incredibly auspicious for Bitcoin” and the cryptocurrency industry as a whole. “I think this is incredibly bullish for digital assets. It’s very good for the crypto industry. We’re going to see a lot more pro-Bitcoin policies. We’re going to see a digital assets framework. We’re going to see an end to the war on crypto. We’re going to see a lot of pro-business policies. I think that, clearly, the SEC will be a big part of it,” he continued. As of press time, one Bitcoin was worth $90,836 after hitting around $93,500 on Wednesday, as per data from CoinGecko. “I’m planning the $100K party,” Saylor opined. “I’m thinking it’s probably going to be New Year’s Eve at my house, so I would be surprised if we don’t go through $100K in November or December.” Saylor ruled out the possibility of the benchmark crypto retracing to $60,000 or even as low as $30,000: “I don’t think it’s going to $60,000, it’s not going to $30,000. I think it is going to go up from here.” The MicroStrategy founder believes Trump winning the presidency has “very decidedly” determined the future of crypto in the U.S., adding, “I don’t really see any threats on the near-term horizon.”

Advertising revenue goes some way to support our mission, but this year it has not been enough. If you've seen value in our reporting, please contribute what you can, so we can continue to produce accurate and meaningful journalism. For everyone who needs it. A MARRIED COUPLE were arrested in Dublin over an international money laundering operation with €21m allegedly transferred through online banks and cryptocurrency accounts, a court has heard. Jixu Wang, 35, and his 34-year-old wife, Ye Wang, who are from China, were charged with possessing crime proceeds in a digital bank account between September 2023 and February this year and have been denied bail. Dublin District Court heard they rented an apartment in south Co Dublin “in the shadow of Blackrock Garda station”. Following a “complex” investigation by the Dublin East Garda economic crime unit, with cooperation from Europol, and police in Germany, Spain, Switzerland and the UK, officers arrested the unemployed couple on Tuesday. They searched their apartment on Avoca Road, Blackrock. The pair previously ran a cryptocurrency trading business and moved from the Philippines to Ireland last year as part of an “immigration investment programme” after donating €400,000 to a charity, ICARE Housing CLG. The couple faced bail objections during separate hearings before Judge John Campbell today. Detective Garda Steven Dunican and Barry Cusack voiced concerns about flight risk or that they could dispose of evidence. It was Mrs Wang’s birthday, and she wept throughout the proceedings. The alleged offences are under the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act which can carry a 14-year sentence, but gardaí expect the DPP will authorise further more serious charges. Detective Garda Steven Dunican and Barry Cusack told Judge Campbell that on March 9, officers from a Garda economic crime unit received information from German police about a suspected investment fraud. A German national had €10,000 transferred from his bank to a Paytend digital bank account of Mr Wang. Detective Garda Cusack conducted inquiries with Paytend regarding Jixu Wang, and it was alleged the accused used his Chinese passport number on the account. Garda Cusack identified 1,894 “unusual transactions that had been transferred into the account to the value of €5,043,705 received from 622 different IBANs over a five-month period between July 2 and November 9 last year. Advertisement It was claimed that there were other unusual transactions between another Paytend account held by his wife, Ye Wang, who is a qualified accountant. Her Paytend account allegedly received 733 transactions valued at just over €2.1m from 321 different bank accounts from September 11, 2023, and January 12 this year. The court heard claims GPS (Global Positioning System) location has been obtained for login dates for both Paytend accounts, matching their address. The detectives outlined how they were both unemployed but there was just over €7m in their accounts. Gardaí including the Criminal Assets Bureau identified €14.7m in cryptocurrency wallets, of which €4.4m has been seized or frozen by the investigation team. Mr Wang was interviewed a dozen times at Blackrock Garda station over four days while his wife sat through 11 interviews. Their apartment was searched, resulting in an alleged seizure of €20,000, gold coins and five envelopes with “seed words” to access a cryptocurrency wallet. Documents, phones and laptops have also been recovered. It was alleged Mrs Wang helped create fake documents to set up “money mule” accounts, but she denied knowing it was part of a crime. The detectives feared the couple, who have a young child, would leave the country if released on bail, as they had no family in Ireland or links to this jurisdiction. Solicitor Andrew Vallely put it to Detective Cusack that his client, Mr Wang, would surrender his passport and undertake to refrain from online or cryptocurrency activity. Eoghan O’Sullivan, Ms Wang’s solicitor, submitted that his client was the principal carer for their child and she too would obey conditions. The defence stressed their clients had no prior convictions, and the detectives agreed with the lawyers that there would be a lengthy period until their trial. The couple listened to the proceedings with the aid of a Mandarin interpreter but have yet to indicate a plea and did not give evidence at the bail hearing. Judge Campbell said they had the presumption of innocence. However, he noted gardaí would not agree to any of the terms suggested by the defence, and he also took into account the evidence and reasons for bail objections cited by the Garda witnesses and the couple’s lack of assets here. He described their ties to Ireland as “tenuous”. They were remanded into prison custody to appear again on Wednesday.

Title: Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) Is A Bottom-Ranked Quant Stock According To UBS

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently made a list of UBS’ Bottom Quant Stocks In AI, IT, Healthcare & Others: 29 Stocks In All Sectors. In this piece, we will look at where Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) ranks on the list of UBS' bottom quant stocks. With November 2024 having settled in and the US presidential election in its final stages, investors are also digesting the results of the latest earnings season. As had been the case for the first and second-quarter earnings season, Q3 was also focused on artificial intelligence. While Wall Street’s AI GPU darling, the firm whose shares are up an unbelievable 206% over the past twelve months, is yet to report its earnings, other consequential firms have got the ball rolling. Two of these are among the most important players in the software segment of the AI industry. The first is known for its tightly-knit relationship with the firm behind ChatGPT, OpenAI. The second is the world’s largest social media company that has made waves in the AI industry with its open-source Llama AI foundational AI model. Starting from the former, its ability to generate AI profits primarily through its cloud computing division is baked into the narrative. Since its earnings report, the shares are down by 4.9%. This is even though the firm’s revenue and earnings per share of $65.59 billion and $3.30 beat analyst estimates of $64.51 billion and $3.10. Along with the earnings and revenue beat, the software company’s Azure cloud computing business which also includes its enterprise-focused AI services grew by 33% annually or 34% on a constant currency basis. These also beat analyst estimates, so on the surface, one would expect the shares to rise. However, Wall Street isn’t always focused on current performance, and for AI stocks, their narratives are built on future expectations. These expectations are priced into the stocks. For the software company, its weak guidance is at the center of the poor share price performance as the current quarter revenue guidance of $68.1 billion to $69.1 billion missed Wall Street estimates of $69.83 billion by more than half a billion dollars. The software company was joined by the social media firm to report its earnings on the same day. The Facebook parent’s shares are also down since the earnings report as they have lost 3.3% after recovering from the bottom of a 5.3% loss. Its earnings report, like the post-report stock performance, also mirrors the software company’s results to an extent. For starters, the social media firm also beat analyst revenue and EPS estimates. It posted $40.59 billion in revenue and $6.03 in earnings per share to beat analyst estimates of $40.29 billion and $5.25. Driving the beat was higher advertising revenue which grew by 18.7% annually to sit at $39.9 billion. However, while the firm’s net income jumped by 35% to touch $15.7 billion, it was the slowest growth in over a year. Additionally, the firm reported that it had 3.29 billion active daily users during the third quarter, which was lower than the 3.31 billion in analyst estimates. Another factor that didn’t impress investors was its AI-driven capital expenditure. The firm raised the lower end of its full-year capital expenditure to $38 billion from $37 billion and kept the high end intact at $40 billion. Higher expenditures increase the return that investors expect and reduce payouts in the form of dividends and share buybacks. Consequently, the stock tumbled after the earnings report. These two AI-driven earnings reports are part of a market that is now facing lower rates, higher growths, and the culmination of a bitterly fought presidential election. In a recent report, investment bank UBS took an optimistic view of the US stock market. It noted that from “a macro perspective, the combination of slowing but durable economic growth, healthy earnings growth, and continued Fed rate cuts is supportive.” The bank is also optimistic about AI and particularly about the broader category of firms apart from the GPU designer that has seen most of the share price gains so far. In its report, it notes that “AI-related companies that span semiconductors, cloud service providers, devices, and data centers account for over one-third of the S&P 500 by market cap. We expect continued growth in AI investment spending to drive revenues and profits.” However, according to UBS, AI is not the only lucrative stock market sector offered by the US stock market. The bank adds that the “S&P 500 also offers exposure to secular growth in longevity through various US medical device companies. Many US companies are also playing leading roles in the energy transition via electric vehicles, renewables, and energy efficiency.” On the topic of interest rate cuts, the report outlines that “50bps cuts at similar labor market conditions as today have historically been positive for equities.” These labor conditions are determined by the 3-month average for US nonfarm payrolls, and UBS also believes that rate cuts by the Federal Reserve can reverberate across global markets. It notes that “Historically, Fed rate cuts of more than 50bps when the market was within 1% of all-time highs have been rare. It only happened during the Volcker era in the mid 1980s. The S&P 500 rallied more than 20% in the 12 months following the jumbo cuts. Also, Fed rate cuts tend to reverberate positively across global equity markets, with Asia ex-Japan and emerging markets as the primary beneficiaries outside the US.” Finally, with the 2024 US Presidential Election over, the bank’s report released ahead of the election also commented on the outcomes on Wall Street. It shared that “S elections are a short-term risk; for instance, if former President Donald Trump is elected, markets may quickly price potential tariffs. However, we would see dips as buying opportunities and recommend gradually phasing in equity exposure.” Our Methodology To make our list of UBS stocks with improving quantitative indicators, we chose the firm’s top stocks that are seeing improvements in EPS growth, P/E ratio, and other indicators. Stocks within each sector were ranked by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares during Q2 2024. The sectors themselves were ranked by the cumulative number of funds that had been invested in the firms in descending order. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A graph plotting the trends and performance of stocks on the public equity markets. Number of Hedge Fund Investors In Q2 2024: 62 Sector: Energy Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) is a large and diversified oil and gas exploration and production company with a global operations base. Consequently, the fact that its shares are down 14.7% year to date is unsurprising given the weak oil industry globally and cratering natural gas prices in the US. For Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY), its decision to acquire Permian Basin producer CrownRock for a $12 billion price tag has expanded its production during a period when the market has struggled to remain optimistic about global oil demand. The acquisition has also increased Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY)’s debt and forced it to cut back on cash payouts. However, recovering oil prices stand to benefit the firm, and a potentially lower rate environment worldwide could see Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) benefit from its higher production and greater economies of scale to earn more margins. Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY)’s management commented on its debt reduction plans during the Q2 2024 earnings call. Here is what they said: “Since the start of the year, we have closed or announced approximately $1 billion of Permian Basin divestitures. The proceeds from these sales will go directly towards debt reduction. This progress on divestitures, coupled with a robust organic cash flow underpinned by our steady focus on operational excellence has positioned us well to reduce our debt in the near term. Sunil will address this in more detail, but we’re excited that we’re on track to retire approximately $3 billion of debt during the third quarter, which means — which speaks to both the quality of our assets and our future cash flow potential.” Overall, OXY ranks 29th on our list of UBS’ bottom quant stocks in AI, IT, healthcare & other sectors. While we acknowledge the potential of OXY as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than OXY but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

As President-elect Donald Trump prepares to take office in January after beating Kamala Harris in the elections, his proposal to establish a strategic national Bitcoin reserve is gaining momentum across the United States. Pennsylvania lawmakers have introduced the Pennsylvania Bitcoin Strategic Reserve Act, legislation that would allow the state treasury to invest in Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset. Following in the footsteps of Senator Cynthia Lummis’ similar proposal, Pennsylvania lawmakers introduced the Pennsylvania Bitcoin Strategic Reserve Act in the state’s House of Representatives on Thursday. The bill, sponsored by Republican Pennsylvania state Rep. Mike Cabell, would allow the treasury to allocate up to 10% of its $7 billion state funds into Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and to diversify beyond traditional assets. “The Pennsylvania Bitcoin Strategic Reserve Act is a visionary step toward securing our state’s financial future,” Cabell stated. Cabell argued that many renowned financial institutions and nation-states, including the United States, have invested in Bitcoin to protect their funds from economic volatility. Moreover, high-profile investment companies like BlackRock and Fidelity are now offering their customers Bitcoin options, while U.S. states such as Wisconsin have also made strategic investments in crypto assets. “The Pennsylvania Bitcoin Strategic Reserve Act is a visionary step toward securing our state’s financial future. By integrating Bitcoin into our reserves, we’re not only protecting Pennsylvania from inflation’s relentless impact but also positioning our state as a leader in financial resilience and innovation,” the state representative added. Mike Cabell stressed that the bill sends a straightforward message: “Pennsylvania is ready to embrace bold, modern solutions to safeguard economic prosperity for generations to come.” If the Pennsylvania Bitcoin Strategic Reserve Act is passed, it would position the state as the first in the country to hold the premier crypto directly on its balance sheet. This could potentially mark a transition toward a more serious integration of crypto assets into governmental economic strategies. The legislation would also set a precedent for other states considering similar moves. On the federal level, Senator Lummis introduced a similar bill dubbed the “Boosting Innovation, Technology and Competitiveness through Optimized Investment Nationwide Act of 2024”, or the BITCOIN ACT. The bill maps out a path for the U.S. states and federal agencies to invest in Bitcoin.

Hiking is a great way of staying in shape and a proven gateway to a healthy and positive lifestyle. At summer’s end, however, many retreat to the fireside believing that winter walking is for masochists. Wrong! Winter walking doesn’t have to be all heroics and hardship, for we now have many low-difficulty trails ideal for those who enjoy a winter ramble. And the good news is that the trails listed below have an atmospheric eatery on the trail or nearby, offering hot beverages and tasty bites. Bray Coastal Camino, Wicklow/Dublin Commemorating pilgrims who walked to Dublin before sailing to complete the Camino, this 30km walk links Bray with Dublin city centre, so it is almost entirely within an urban setting. This may seem off-putting, but this is actually a highly varied walk, offering much to discover and memorable sea views. It is best enjoyed as a two-day walk, finishing the first day in Dún Laoghaire. Along the way, you will enjoy Bray Seafront, Shanganagh Park, Seafield Coastal Path, Killiney Beach, Bullock Harbour, the Forty-Foot bathing place and the James Joyce Tower, which houses a museum devoted to the writer’s life. The next day’s highlights include Blackrock Park, Booterstown Nature Reserve, Grand Canal Dock and Christ Church Cathedral. Finish at the Church of St James on James St and then pop in next door for a hot beverage in Groundstate Coffee Shop. The Coastal Camino is not waymarked, but a comprehensive turn-by-turn account of the route is available within the Bray Celtic Camino brochure. This can be downloaded from the website of the Irish Camino Society. caminosociety.ie The Derry Walls, Co Derry Sublimely situated on the River Foyle, Derry offers an intriguing mix of outstanding architecture with historic resonance and makes an ideal gateway to the Donegal Highlands or the Causeway Coast. The city’s show pony is, however, its 1.5km of city walls. Built to withstand canon fire, the walls are 9m wide and make a perfect breezy winter walk with expansive views over the city, the famous Bogside Murals, the Creggan and the red white and blue bedecked Fountain Estate. And if you require more information, there are two museums along the way. The Tower Museum tells the full story of the city from the time of its foundation by St Columba, while the Siege Museum recounts how the Derry Apprentice Boys resisted the attempt by King James II to capture the city during the siege of 1689. Just beneath the walls, an enchanting little Craft Village offers an eclectic mix of artisan shops, restaurants, and atmospheric coffee shops. thederrywalls.com Scilly Walk, Kinsale, Co Cork Renowned for its sea views, the Scilly Walk represents a “must do” 6km walk for anyone visiting Kinsale. Take the footpath along the Lower Road from the town centre and up the hill to the Spaniard Pub, where you swing right down a narrow lane. With the sea a constant presence to your right, continue until the route dives inland through woodlands to gain High Road. Go right here, through picturesque Summercove and then up the hill to the magnificent viewing point over Kinsale Harbour at Charles Fort. Afterwards, retrace your steps, stopping for a hot beverage at the cosy and firelit Bulman Bar in Summercove or the atmospheric Spaniard Inn further up the hill. kinsale.ie Sherkin Island, Co Cork Ireland’s offshore islands are generally for summer, but Sherkin is an exception. An all-year-round island because of its proximity to the coast, the regular ferry service involves just a 10-minute sea crossing of a sheltered harbour from the salty, maritime village of Baltimore. A nice walk to acquaint yourself with the island, the 2km Horseshoe Loop begins from near the island pier and follows tracks and quiet roads above Horseshoe Harbour. About halfway around, you have the option of tagging the blue arrows for about 1km to reach Blue Flag, Silver Strand, offering an expansive vista across multi-islanded Roaringwater Bay to Cape Clear Island. Retrace your steps and then complete the Horseshoe Loop. For a warm beverage, the nearby Jolly Roger, which opens Friday, Saturday and Sunday from noon with light bites until 4pm is your best bet. Otherwise, return to Bushes Bar, Baltimore, to enjoy your beverage and maybe a delicious crab sandwich. alltrails.com [ Ireland’s pilgrim paths: ‘I only go to Mass for weddings and funerals now, but you experience the goodness of people on these walks’Opens in new window ] Ardmore Cliff Walk, Co Waterford This 5km stroll offers spectacular coastal views and a sense of reconnecting with history. Start from the centre of Ardmore by keeping the ocean on your left as you ascend while following the signs for the Cliff Walk. Pass the Cliff House Hotel and continue by the early Christian Church and Well of St Declan. Beyond, the path meanders spectacularly around Ardmore Head, with great declivities falling left to the wreck of the Sampson crane ship, which foundered in 1988. Rounding Rams Head, you will be rewarded with a photogenic panorama over Youghal Bay to the east Cork coastline. Now swing inland to explore St Declan’s Monastery. Occupying a striking location, the most prominent landmarks are the 30m high round tower and the roofless 12th century cathedral, which represents one of Ireland’s finest examples of Romanesque architecture. After that, it’s just a short ramble downhill to Ardmore for a beverage and a bite in the family-run Whitehorses Restaurant. ardmorewaterford.com Drumleague Loop Walk, Co Leitrim As befits a canal towpath, this is an easy waterside walk on a level surface. From Battlebridge Lock, which lies about 1km west of Leitrim village on the R284, follow the signs for the Leitrim Way and keep the Lough Allen Canal on your right to reach Drumleague Lock after about 2.5km. Go right across the bridge and then head south along L7381 which follows the opposite bank of the canal for about 2.5km to regain Battlebridge. If you wish to extend your walk, you can follow the canal for another 2.5km to reach Drumhauver Bridge. Cross the canal again and return by the opposite bank. From Drumhauver, you can extend your walk by 1km to sample the unique Floating Boardwalk on Acres Lake, but you will have to follow the same side of the canal on your return. For your hot beverage and maybe more, Beirnes of Battlebridge, an award-winning Gastropub, is open for food from Thursday to Sunday. Otherwise, it is just a 10-minute footpath walk to Leitrim Village, where there are several good food offerings. leitrimtourism.com One of Ireland’s oldest planned settlements, Abbeyleix is now an outstanding heritage town that rewards visitors with an easy 4.5km, walking trail. Starting from the car park at the Manor Hotel, follow the green arrows for the Collins Bog Loop across the N77 and continue through the sylvan paths of Abbeyleix Demesne. Then, it’s back across the N77 and on to a green lane leading to Killamuck Bog, which is managed by local volunteers and has a boardwalk giving access to its peaty heartland. Here, you have the option of diverting to the 8km Killamuck Loop by going right and trailing the purple arrows as they circumnavigate the entire bog. Otherwise, continue following the green arrows left along the edge of the bog and then onwards through serene woodland to regain the Manor House, Hotel. discoverireland.ie/laois For your beverage, it’s Polly’s Café, conveniently located beside your parking place. Open seven days a week, it has covered seating with glass walls, heating and serves warm drinks, cakes, sandwiches and salads. [ Nine storied Irish walks: from rebel hills to drowned Spanish sailorsOpens in new window ] Waterford Greenway, Co Waterford From the car park at Waterford’s South East Technological University, West Campus, follow the signs for the Waterford Greenway. Once on the greenway, go left and continue for about 3km with the River Suir a constant presence to your left. When you see the sign pointing left for Mount Congreve, pop in to the Stables Restaurant for a heartwarming beverage. At this stage, it would be remiss not to visit the famous gardens that were created, as a passion project, by industrialist Ambrose Congreve and have long been regarded as among the world’s finest, (admission charge applies). Afterwards, with an enhanced feeling of peace and wellbeing, retrace your steps to SETU, car park. greenwaysireland.org/waterford-greenway/ Aherlow winter Walking Festival, Co Tipperary (January 24th to 26th) Walking festivals have recently been popping up countrywide like buds in May. Unsurprisingly, they are entirely confined to our warmer months, with just one exception; the canny folks from the Glen of Aherlow have their festival at the coldest time of year and have reaped a rich reward with an event that has been running for over a decade. This isn’t surprising for the Glen of Aherlow is a true gem for walkers with the Slievenamuck range offering great low and moderate outings. To the south, the Galtee Mountains provide long challenging circuits on Ireland’s highest inland range, which is regularly snow-covered in January. At day’s end, treat yourself to a hot drink in the Huntsman’s Bar of old world Aherlow House Hotel, which is the base for the event.

Title: The brain-computer interface revolution is just getting started

Time Published: 2024-11-16T00:13:17Z

Whether it’s jacking into the Matrix or becoming a Na’avi in Avatar, connecting brains to computers is a science-fiction trope that I never thought I’d see become a reality. But increasingly, BCIs (brain-computer interfaces) have become a serious area of study in research labs, rapidly advancing from research labs to real human trials — perhaps most famously by the Elon Musk’s company Neuralink. While this promises individuals with disabilities a greater degree of freedom and control, along with potential applications in gaming and health care, significant technical, ethical, and regulatory challenges remain. But the more I dug into the topic, the more I found leaders and researchers rising to the occasion to lead us responsibly into the future of the this groundbreaking technology. Let’s start at the beginning. In a sentence, BCIs are devices that bridge the gap, essentially translating, between your brain’s analog electrical signals and external digital machines. “Bypassing the conventional communication channels for different tasks (e.g., vision, movement, and speech), BCI links the brain’s electrical activity and the external world to augment human capabilities in interacting with the physical environment,” a 2023 study from the journal Brain Inform reads. “BCI provides a non-muscular communication channel and facilitates acquisition, manipulation, analysis, and translation of brain signals to control external devices or applications.” Early BCI development actually began back in the 1920’s with the advent of the electroencephalogram (EEG), a test that uses electrodes to amplify and then measure electrical activity in the brain. However, modern BCIs evolved in the 1970s through the work of UCLA’s Dr. Jacques Vidal, with funding from the National Science Foundation and DARPA. He was the first researcher to coin the term “brain-computer interface” as well. Over the last half century, BCIs have found clinical use in a variety of applications, from mapping the inner workings of the brain to augmenting human cognition and motor skills. BCIs are even being used to restore physical mobility in patients suffering from injury and disease, such as ALS or brainstem stroke, or folks who are “locked-in” — cognitively intact but without useful muscle function. The potential is incredibly exciting, but as you can likely imagine, there are some seemingly insurmountable challenges that the researchers of this technology are having to face head-on. You might assume that all modern brain-computer interfaces involve brain surgery, but the technology actually comes in many forms, depending on how close to the user’s gray matter the device is situated. There are wholly non-invasive types that we’re all familiar with, such as EEGs and MRIs, which simply monitor and record brain activity. Then, there are what is classified as “partially-invasive” endovascular EEGs, which use a catheter to deliver electrodes into the brain without requiring open brain surgery. Non-invasive BCIs pick up the brain’s electrical impulses through the patient’s skull and scalp and transmit them directly to the external device. While this sounds appealing in that it doesn’t require brain surgery, the technology is rife with challenges. One of the biggest problems with externally-worn BCIs, for example, is their low signal-to-noise ratios. This means that the electrical impulses picked up are often muddled with interference from the skull and scalp, making it difficult to accurately decode brain signals. Decoding these signals is further complicated by the brain’s intricate neural patterns, which require sophisticated algorithms and significant computational resources to interpret reliably. I spoke with Dr. Jane Huggins, the director of the University of Michigan Direct Brain Interface Laboratory, to further understand the challenges presented in BCIs seen today. “Let’s make a list of the things that affect your brain activity … well, maybe let’s make a list of the things that don’t because that’s going to be a shorter list,” Huggins quipped. “Everything from what the patient is currently seeing to the amount of light in the room to what they just ate for lunch to their emotional state, all can affect the amplitude of the signals and the complexity of what’s going on. It’s hard to pick out the pieces that you need.” Meanwhile, in terms of comfort and usability, non-invasive BCIs can be uncomfortable to wear for extended periods due to bulky electrodes and headsets. It’s why the idea of invasive brain implants has become the future of where this technology is headed, a future that came barreling into the present in 2024 like never before. Implantable BCIs takes the impulses directly from the brain matter the chip is sitting on and translates them into commands. It then wirelessly relays those command signals to an external device, which carries them out. Dr. Huggins makes the case that although some people will always be uneasy about the idea of implanting a device in your brain, in the long run, it’s the most convenient option. “People have a tendency to refer to implanted BCIs as ‘invasive,'” she told me. “Certainly there’s surgery involved if you’re implanting a BCI and it can be quite a dramatic surgery.” On the other hand, Huggins likens it to her own artificial hip surgery she received a couple of years back. Invasive surgery? Yes. But in daily live, they can be forgotten about entirely. For one, implanted BCIs don’t require the 10- to 20-minute setup needed to operate them daily. They also don’t require charging and cleaning as external BCIs do. Huggins posited that future BCI devices could offer the benefits from both externally worn and implanted BCIs, similar to how today’s cochlear implants operate. “If you could implant those EEG electrodes under the scalp, you wouldn’t have to put them on and take them off every day, and they would be invisible.” Furthermore, the basics of the technology has been around longer than you might assume. It’s been decades since the first neuroprostheses were installed in humans, and the field continues to expand at a rapid pace. That’s leads us to where we are today, with the first patients receiving these implanted chips. After a six-year study and getting FDA approval in 2023, Neuralink launched its clinical trial for its first implantable chip, completing the surgery in January of 2024 on its first patient. In just a couple of months, Neuralink had posted an update, showing the patient controlling a laptop to play online only with his brain, which he compared to “using the Force on the cursor.” By now, Neuralink’s BCI trial has found a second patient, while the first has gone from playing chess to playing Civilization VI. Neuralink gets all the spotlight due to its high-profile founder, but it’s far from alone. Brooklyn New York’s Synchron, which is developing a device that can be safely implanted into the brain’s blood vessels, began its six-patient clinical trial last year. BrainGate, a research cadre amalgamated from universities across the U.S., implanted the world’s first wireless, high-bandwidth BCI in 2021. Blackrock Neurotech, on the other hand, is headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah, and has been running human trials with its Utah array BCI for more than two decades with zero FDA-reported “serious adverse events” in that time. In these applications, the devices enable users to effectively bypass damaged and non-responsive limbs to control external devices directly with their thoughts and perform activities without depending on healthy people, significantly improving the quality of their lives. The technology has already revolutionized a number of fields of research, including entertainment and gaming, industrial automation, education, and neuromarketing. While implanted BCIs feel like the future of the field, but they certainly come with their own challenges. For example, even with implanted BCIs, which provide a higher quality of signal, long-term stability remains an issue. These devices can degrade over time due to biological tissue reactions or mechanical failures, limiting their usability and lifespan for continuous applications. The implanted BCI also doesn’t overcome the hurdle of all the training and calibration required, which poses a significant challenge for BCI technology. Users often need extensive practice to gain effective control over these devices, making the process both time-consuming and sometimes frustrating, as Dr. Huggins explained. Neuralink has an app in development to help with this process, helping patients along to train their minds to better control digital devices, which has already been tested with monkeys. Beyond convenience and cost, the technology’s ethical and privacy consequences pose significant challenges to BCI’s further development. The data generated by BCIs — our emotions, intentions, and thoughts — are intrinsically personal and raises the risk that such data could be unintentionally collected and misused. BCIs adoption also creates issues with autonomy, consent, and accessibility. What’s to stop someone from being forced to use a BCI against their will or without fully understanding its consequences? “I can think of nothing scarier than having someone decide for you that you want an implanted BCI and give it to you,” Huggins said. “And you can’t ask any questions about what’s going on or express your opinion.” The same is true for leveraging AI and machine learning systems to assist BCI patients. “We can combine a lot of the [functions of] artificial intelligence and BCIs, but that does start raising the same kind of questions you run into with any kind of share and control: Who’s deciding? What’s going to be said?” “And that gets back to the ethical questions we were talking about earlier about self-determination. If you have someone whose abilities are deteriorating [such as ALS patients], is there a balance? Will that balance change over time? Or am I just going to give up and start letting the AI auto-complete my sentences?” “Don’t worry about people reading your thoughts from satellites.” These are serious concerns for the future, even if we’re still a long way off from really needing to face them. “I’m only able to pick that up with, you know, 90% accuracy, maybe 95% accuracy on a good day. On a bad day, well, you can go as low as as low as possible on a bad day. But that’s someone who is actively voluntarily trying to communicate a message.” Huggins makes the point to quell one of the biggest challenges to the future of BCI: fear and misconceptions. “It scares a lot of people,” Huggins conceded. “I had somebody ask me once if the government could read their thoughts from satellites. And I was like, ‘well, you know, I have trouble getting the correct answer when I have somebody sitting in my lab who let me put this headset on and is actively trying to pay attention to a key on the keyboard. Don’t worry about people reading your thoughts from satellites.” Certainly, BCI researchers face considerable challenges in bringing this revolutionary technology to the general public, perhaps none more so than managing expectations. Huggins notes that her colleagues who work with implanted research studies go through a very rigorous process to make sure that participants in those studies understand what the plan is as well as a realistic understanding of the benefits and the risks. Those same courtesies are rarely extended to the general public who are bombarded with fantastical promises of telepathic communication, perfect memory and recall, and even a melding of human and robotic minds. As for where BCI is heading in our lifetimes, Huggins conceded that a lowering of expectations would be necessary to really see the progress. “I think there will be things available, I just don’t think it will live up to all of the hype. It’s gonna change expectations. One needs to have expectations that are realistic, and understand that this is new technology. We’re still learning how it works, why it works, when it works, when it doesn’t work, what kind of support it needs, and how many places are going to be able to deliver it.” So no, we likely won’t be experiencing “Whoa, I know Kung Fu” moments in the foreseeable future. But that’s not to say that the next generation won’t. We might have a long way to go, but the foundation of those future experiences is being built today — and that’s reason to be excited. Elon Musk, the owner of Neuralink, said the company will be providing an update about its research on October 31. This comes shortly after reports surfaced of Musk's frustration with the slow progress. Neuralink aims to develop an interface that allows direct connection of a human brain and computer technology. If successful, you might someday expand your processing capabilities and sensory perception through hardware upgrades. That's the futuristic angle that Elon Musk pitched when first introducing this new endeavor. A Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) is now in clinical trials on human patients, the first time this has ever happened in the United States. With all of the buzz around Neuralink, one might expect this breakthrough would come from Elon Musk's moonshot company. However, the honor goes to a lesser-known brain interface technology leader, Synchron, and its Stentrode device. While flashy claims of BCIs allowing VR games without a headset and amplifying human intelligence might make headlines, those are distant dreams. Meanwhile, tangible solutions to medical problems that affect patients today are being addressed by Synchron and other BCI innovators. Microsoft announced it will stop the development and distribution of controversial emotion-reading software as big tech companies pivot toward privacy and security. The company also says it will heavily restrict its own facial recognition platform. Microsoft’s shift away from emotional recognition software is another sign of big tech’s growing prioritization of privacy. The company also admits there is little scientific evidence behind the technology.

Title: Binance Sees Persistent Bitcoin Outflows as Price Holds Near $90,000, Signal of Long-Term Bullish Sentiment

On-chain data shows that there have been persistent outflows from leading cryptocurrency exchange Binance, even as the price of Bitcoin hovers around the $90,000 mark, down from a new all-time high above $93,000. As highlighted by a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post, Binance’s Exchange Netflow has consistently registered negative values over the past few weeks. The metric tracks the net movement of Bitcoin into or out of exchange wallets, with a negative value indicating a net outflow, suggesting that holders are opting to store their Bitcoin in self-custodial wallets, a bullish sign for the long-term outlook of the cryptocurrency. Net outflows are interpreted as a bullish signal given Bitcoin’s limited supply, as more coins being stored on-chain suggests available supply on exchanges is dropping, leading to potential price increases if demand remains or increases. A chart provided by CryptoQuant illustrates the significant negative spikes in Bitcoin Exchange Netflow for Binance earlier this month, coinciding with the recent rally. These large-scale accumulation moves likely contributed to the price surge. The outflows come as the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) offered by the world’s largest asset manager BlackRock, the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), has seen over $3 billion of inflows over the past five days. As CryptoGlobe reported, the spot Bitcoin ETFs launched in the United States earlier this year have seen their total assets cross the $90 billion mark after seeing a $6 billion ump in a single day, and are now over three-thirds of the way of surpassing gold ETFs in assets. That’s according to senior Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, who on the microblogging platform X (formerly known as Twitter) pointed out that spot Bitcoin ETFs’ $6 billion jump in a day came with $1 billion of inflows, and $5 billion of market appreciation amid a significant BTC price rise. Notably, cryptocurrency investment products have also been seeing significant inflows, bringing in $1.98 billion in the week after Republican candidate Donald Trump won the US presidential elections. According to CoinShares latest Digital Asset Fund Flows report, the inflows couple with the cryptocurrency market rally have pushed the total assets under management of crypto investment products to a $116 billion high. The report details that Bitcoin-focused investment products saw $1.79 billion inflows over the past week, while Ethereum-focused products saw $157 million inflows. Featured image via Unsplash.

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Stocks tumbled on Friday as the post-election rally fizzled and investors fretted over the path of interest rates. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 305.87 points, or 0.70%, to end at 43,444.99. The S&P 500 slipped 1.32% and closed at 5,870.62, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 2.24% to 18,680.12. Declines in pharmaceutical stocks weighed on the 30-stock Dow and broader S&P 500, with Amgen down about 4.2% and Moderna off by 7.3%. President-elect Donald Trump said on Thursday that he planned to nominate vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the Department of Health and Human Services. The SPDR S&P Biotech ETF (XBI) tumbled more than 5% and posted its worst week since 2020. The information technology sector of the S&P 500 was the worst performing corner of the market, down more than 2% as Nvidia, MetaPlatforms, Alphabet and Microsoft tumbled. Tesla was a rare exception among its Magnificent Seven peers, as shares of the electric vehicle giant and so-called “Trump Trade” were higher by 3%. “While we think the macro backdrop still bodes well for risk assets, in the near term we should expect some micro volatility, particularly around potential policy shifts under a new administration,” said Kristy Akullian, head of iShares investment strategy, Americas, at BlackRock. “We expect the U.S. equity market to continue to move higher, but don’t expect that rise to happen in a straight line.” Traders also grappled with recent comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, who said on Thursday that the central bank wasn’t “in a hurry” to cut interest rates. He noted that the economy’s strong growth will permit policymakers to take their time as they decide the extent to which they reduce rates. Boston Fed President Susan Collins took the cautious sentiment further, telling The Wall Street Journal that a rate cut next month isn’t a certainty. October retail sales data on Friday showed a 0.4% increase, slightly better than the 0.3% forecast from economists polled by Dow Jones. That finding follows an October consumer inflation report that was in line with economists’ projections. The major averages had been coasting on a post-election rally since Trump’s victory at the polls — the three indexes touched fresh highs on Monday — but the upward momentum has been slowing. The S&P 500 posted a weekly loss of 2.1%, while the Nasdaq Composite slid about 3.2%. The 30-stock Dow fell 1.2% in the period.

Title: Establishment Economists Threaten Trump: Deportations Will Spike Inflation
URL: https://www.breitbart.com/economy/2024/11/15/establishment-economists-threaten-trump-deportations-will-spike-inflation/
Time Published: 2024-11-15T21:29:40Z

Establishment economists are threatening President-elect Donald Trump with a new round of inflation if he restores Americans’ civil right to a secure national border. But the free market will manage the inflation threat by hiring Americans in place of deported migrants, and by investing in productivity-raising machinery, responded EJ Antoni, an economist at the Heritage Foundation. “I see no reason why the adjustment would not happen almost immediately,” he told Breitbart News. In 2017, for example, shortly after Trump first cracked down on migration, meatpacking giant Tysons Food allocated $500 million to begin automating its slaughterhouses and by raising wages many other companies also hired sidelined workers, including ex-convicts, and disabled people. Democrat-aligned economists and media outlets raised the alarm this week as Trump appointed immigration reformers to key posts. “If you’re talking about deporting millions of people, that is an invitation to labor shortages and bottlenecks,” former treasury secretary Larry Summers told CNN on November 15. “If he carries through on what he said during his campaign, there will be an inflation shock significantly greater than the one the country suffered in 2021,” he declared. “If [agriculture sector] workers are deported, the food industry will probably have great difficulty replacing them,” New York Times economist Paul Krugman wrote on November 11. “The industry will have to offer much higher wages [to hire American workers] — and, of course, these higher wages will be passed on in higher [inflated grocery] prices.” Their threats are being echoed by CEOs who hire migrants: The claimed economic damage from migration is also being echoed by business reporters who largely avoided migrants’ economic impact throughout Biden’s presidency. “Trump’s Immigration Plans Could Bring an Economic Toll,” a New York Times economics reporter wrote on November 13. “If Mr. Trump accomplishes anything close to what he has pledged [on migration], many economists expect higher prices on goods and services and possibly lower employment rates for American workers,” the article claimed. Both Summers and Krugman have long supported the establishment’s economic strategy of extracting migrants from poor countries to stimulate the U.S. consumer economy. That Extraction Migration strategy is good for elite investors on Wall Street — but has been terrible for and unpopular among many millions of ordinary Americans who voted Trump into power. Now both economists are defending that Extraction Migration strategy with warnings about deportations and inflation — while they also ignore obvious economic factors that can prevent inflation. Those factors include greater corporate investment in productivity, the shift of Americans from low-value jobs to higher-wage jobs, and the hiring of several million men who have been pushed out of the workforce over the last few decades. Job-Switching Americans Deported migrants cannot be replaced by Americans, Krugman insists: That [backup] workforce isn’t there. We have essentially full employment among native-born Americans. There is no reserve of Americans to take these jobs, by and large jobs that native-born Americans would be very reluctant to take. But the U.S. economy employs 170 million people, including roughly 6 million Biden migrants. That huge labor force ensures successful companies can hire workers from unsuccessful companies. In addition, “there are roughly 18.5 million working-age U.S.-born men [who are] not in the labor force,” Steven Camarota, the research director at the Center for Immigration Studies, told Breitbart News. Those people are not even counted as unemployed because they have given up searching for jobs, he said. This population of workforce dropouts helps create other civic problems, such as drug deaths, lower rates of marriage, and declining births, he said: They don’t have partners anymore who push them to work, right? They don’t have children they have to support. The [civic] norm of supporting children and partners if you have them is way down. We know that the men most likely not to work are those who are unmarried, those who have children, and those who don’t live with their children. “We could maybe bring 5 million of them back into jobs,” he said. “That might be a reasonable kind of goal.” Trump’s Vice President, Sen. JD Vance (R-OH), slammed the employers’ divisive claim that migrants fill jobs that Americans do not want. In October, he told a surprised New York Times journalist: One of the really deranged things that I think illegal immigration does to our society is it gets us in a mind-set of saying we can only build houses with illegal immigrants when we have [sidelined] seven million — just men, not even women, just men — who have completely dropped out of the labor force. Moreover, many Americans have been pushed out of white-collar jobs because of illegal and legal white-collar migration. If Trump enforces the border laws at U.S. airports, employers can rehire the U.S. college grads they fired. Many older Americans have retired, and some may be drawn back into work by the promise of higher wages that can augment Social Security checks. Productivity Neither Krugman nor Summers mentioned the reality that companies can solve labor shortages by investing in labor-saving machinery. “There are certain occupations that are really very heavily immigrant,” Krugman said, adding: top of the list would be food. Agricultural workers, about three quarters are immigrants and probably about half of them are undocumented. Meat packing is probably between 30 and 50 percent undocumented immigrants. So the whole food supply chain is reliant on people who are going to be rounded up and put in camps. When Trump shrank the inflow of migrants in 2017, wages rose and companies started buying more labor-saving machinery, such as automated cow-milking devices. In Lincoln, Nebraska, Costco opened a new slaughterhouse to process millions of chickens with technology developed in Iceland for its seafood industry. Watch: In fact, a labor shortage can be a good thing for economic growth and prosperity, BlackRock founder Larry Fink said at a pro-globalist event in April hosted by the World Economic Forum in Saudi Arabia: “We always used to think [a] shrinking population is a cause for negative [economic] growth … But in my conversations with the leadership of these large, developed countries [such as China, and Japan] that have xenophobic anti-immigration policies, they don’t allow anybody to come in — [so they have] shrinking demographics — these countries will rapidly develop robotics and AI and technology … If a promise of all that transforms productivity, which most of us think it will — we’ll be able to elevate the standard living in countries, the standard of living for individuals, even with shrinking populations. However, “if you have a huge flood of [migrant] labor into the market, especially if it’s all low-skill labor, you reduce the incentive for business capital investment,” said Antoni. In Biden’s four years, labor productivity grew by only 0.7 percent annually, according to Jason Furman, a Harvard economist who worked for President Barack Obama. The Biden failure is displayed in Charleroi, Pennsylvania, where a rush of Biden migrants allows a food company to profit from a cheap, l0w-tech, food-processing plant. AmericanCompass.org reported: A Charleroi business owner invited CBS News into his factory to see the work being done by migrant workers. Though only a few seconds of video is shown in the CBS report, the main task one sees workers doing in the video is manually moving bowls of food from one conveyor belt onto another. It’s not difficult to imagine automation playing a greater role in that process. “I have a hard time getting anyone to talk about productivity, let alone productivity related to migrants,” Antoni said. The slow productivity growth under Biden helped minimize wage gains for Americans. The resulting poverty helped Trump win in November. The same process of immigration, poverty, and political unrest is underway in Canada and the United Kingdom. In both countries, productivity and wages have fallen as millions of migrants were imported to expand the countries’ consumer economies. Unhappy voters in the U.K. evicted the Prime Minister this year, and Canadian voters are expected to force the retirement of Justin Trudeau in 2025. Migrants’ Impact on Inflation Biden’s deputies imported migrants to help suppress wages and wage inflation amid Congress’s massive spending. However, those migrants boosted inflation in the housing sector. The migration-inflated rents prompted many younger Americans to back Trump in November. “He was seen as a change agent, as an alternative to a status quo marked by inflation and the migrant crisis,” Rep. Ritchie Torres (D-NY) told the Atlantic. As Trump sends Biden’s migrants home, rents will drop, he will help reverse the inflation that is threatened by Krugman and Summers — while also providing a windfall bonus to millions of young Americans who rent housing. In Canada, Prime Minister Justice Trudeau is trying to save his career by curbing his migration flood. That is good news for ordinary Canadians, Robert Kavcic, a bank economist, told CBC News. “The first thing you’re going to see here is a lot of the pressure that we’ve been facing in the Canadian economy starting to get alleviated … specifically pressure on rents,” he said. Florida Krugman warned that the enforcement of immigration laws by Gov. Ron. DeSantis has been “disastrous” for the state’s agricultural sector: I’ve been looking a little bit of a dress rehearsal for some of this [Trump policy] in DeSantis’ Florida, where he’s done a crackdown. The results for Florida agriculture have already been disastrous. But Floridians are gaining wages and benefits because DeSantis cracked down on the use of illegal labor, ABC Action News reported in September 2024: Career Source of Hillsborough and Pinellas [a government-funded training program] says local employers are offering more incentives such as transportation and childcare subsidies. “Jobseekers, what they’re looking for is employers that offer flexibility in schedule, living wage and a company that they want to work for versus need to work for,” [Caeer Source official] Mario Rodriguez said. That trend of fewer migrants and higher wages has been good news for Republicans and Trump, who won the state in a November landslide. The rising wages are also forcing companies and farmers to invest in more labor-saving technology that helps to calm worker shortages and further push up voters’ wages. Many research companies are already rolling out new generations of labor-saving equipment that can free up many workers for other jobs. “More than 706,000 jobs in Florida will be cut or impacted by automation and technology in some way,” the South Florida Business Journal reported in October. Arizona In the mid-2000s, a citizen ballot in Arizona forced state officials to crack down on illegal labor. Because of the 40 percent drop in illegal labor, the wages earned by Americans rose significantly, according to a 2016 analysis by Moody’s Analytics, which strongly supports more migration. A 2016 investigation in the pro-migration Wall Street Journal reported: The median income of low-skilled whites who did manage to get jobs rose about 6% during that period, the economists estimate … wages rose about 15% for Arizona farmworkers and about 10% for construction between 2010 and 2014 … Some employers say their need for workers has increased since then, leading them to boost wages more rapidly and crimping their ability to expand … graduates [at a federal job-training center] now often mull two or three jobs offers from construction firms and occasionally start at $14.65 an hour instead of $10. Housing prices fell, allowing more young Americans to start families, according to the Journal: “It was like, ‘Where did everybody go?’ ” says Teresa Acuna, a Phoenix real-estate agent who works in Latino neighborhoods. Real-estate agent Patti Gorski says her sales records show that prices of homes owned by Spanish-speaking customers fell by 63% between 2007 and 2010, compared with a 44% drop for English-speaking customers, a difference she attributes partly to financial pressure on owners who had been renting homes to immigrants who departed. Productivity climbed as companies invested in machinery, said the Journal: [Farmer] Rob Knorr couldn’t find enough Mexican field hands to pick his jalapeño peppers. He sharply reduced his acreage and invested $2 million developing a machine to remove pepper stems. His goal was to cut the number of laborers he needed by 90% and to hire higher-paid U.S. machinists instead … He says mechanization is his future. He continues to pour time and money into a laser-guided device to remove stems from peppers, which pickers now do by hand in the field. Another farmer in the area developed a mechanical carrot harvester. Conclusion “It is very difficult to find accurate analysis in this area, because pretty much everyone seems to approach it from the standpoint of their own agenda,” said Antoni. For people who favor “illegal aliens coming to this country — which is essentially what this administration has been doing for the last four years — they come out with what are essentially fraudulent economic analyses that only look at the alleged benefits of illegal immigration and don’t look at any of the costs,” he said.

Since the Energia All-Ireland League resumed after the Covid hiatus, save for Young Munster replacing Lansdowne in the semi-finals two seasons ago, a big four have asserted themselves. But after six rounds in Division 1A this season, three of that quartet, namely Terenure, the champions Cork Con and Lansdowne, have already lost 10 games between them. Such is the changed landscape in the top flight, with St Mary’s especially taking to life in 1A like a storm, while Ballynahinch top the table. Those two and Clontarf have opened up a seven-point lead from the peloton, whereas just six points separate the teams from fourth to ninth. The net effect has been to leave Lansdowne, Cork Con and Terenure in real need of home wins today against Clontarf, St Mary’s and Garryowen respectively. Injury-hit and beaten at home by Ballynahinch through a late penalty last week, Lansdowne welcome back fullback Cathal Eddy, winger Rory Parata, outhalf Stephen Madigan, scrumhalf Jack Matthews, hooker Chris Poole, tighthead Greg McGrath, lock Juan Beukes and Donough Lawlor at number eight. By contrast, although Clontarf are without Aitzol Arenzana-King, who is on Leinster A duty and so bring in Mark O’Sullivan, their only other change is Charlie Ward at tighthead. Billy Crowley starts at fullback for Con, who have a new halfback partnership of Adam Maher and Aidan Moynihan, while there is one change up front, with Charlie Connolly starting at tighthead and Luke Masters shifting to loosehead against a St Mary’s side who they trail by eight points. Buoyed by their derby win over Terenure in front of an estimated 3,500 attendance at home last week, St Mary’s name an unchanged team. Their neighbours, meanwhile, make a multitude of changes for the visit of Garryowen to Lakelands Park. Aran Egan moves to fullback, with Adam La Grue shifting to midfield in the absence of Chris Cosgrave, who is on trial at Bath, and where he is partnered by Ethan Reilly. With Fintan Gunne on Leinster A duty, Alan Bennie returns alongside Conor McKeon, the former Connacht scrumhalf. Props Marcus Hanan and Luke Rigney are also named, with Adam Melia moving to lock as the ex-Ospreys flanker Will Hickey and Jim White are promoted to the backrow. An inconsistent Young Munster host an improving and competitive City of Armagh side while, needless to say, the untimely A interpro between Connacht Eagles and Leinster in Creggs RFC has impacted most severely on UCD and Corinthians. Six UCD players feature in Leinster’s starting XV which thus restricts their hand for the trek to leaders Ballynahinch, on a run of four successive wins. Similarly, the Eagles have drawn heavily from Corinthians, who lead 2A with 29 points out of a possible 30 and host third-placed Cashel, taking seven players in total including the Ireland Under-20 pair of Seán Naughton and John Devine, with Orin Burke shifting to outhalf and Harry Rogers promoted to fullback. Second-placed Instonians host fourth-placed MU Barnhall in the clubs’ first meeting since 2013. Men Division 1A: Cork Constitution v St Mary’s College, Temple Hill; Lansdowne v Clontarf, Aviva Stadium back pitch; Terenure College v Garryowen, Lakelands; Young Munster v City of Armagh, Tom Clifford Park. Division 1B: Old Wesley v Highfield, Energia Park (2.15); Naas v Blackrock College, Forenaughts; Queen’s v Old Belvedere, Dub Lane; UCC v Dublin University, The Mardyke (3.0); Shannon v Nenagh Ormond, Thomond Park (5.0). Division 2A: Instonians v MU Barnhall, Shaws Bridge (2.0); Corinthians v Cashel, Corinthian Park; Greystones v Buccaneers, Dr Hickey Park; Navan v Banbridge, Balreask Old; Old Crescent v Ballymena, Takumi Park. Division 2B: Dungannon v Galwegians, Stevenson Park; Malahide v Wanderers, Estuary Road; Malone v UL Bohemian, Gibson Park; Skerries v Rainey, Holmpatrick; Sligo v Clogher Valley, Hamilton Park. Division 2C: Clonmel v Enniscorthy, Ardgaoithe; Dolphin v Ballyclare, Virgin Media Park; Monkstown v Belfast Harlequins, Sydney Parade; Omagh Academicals v Midlteon, Thomas Mellon Playing Fields; Tullamore v Bruff, Spollanstown. Women’s Division (5.0): Ballincollig v Blackrock College, Tanner Park; Cooke v Old Belvedere, Shaws Bridge; Galwegians v Railway Union, Crowley Park; Tullow v Suttonians, The Black Gates; Wicklow v UL Bohemian, Ashtown Lane.

Title: Why is cryptocurrency rising and bitcoin at an all-time high?

Getty Images Bitcoin is the most widely traded and well-known type of cryptocurrency. Since it was first created back in 2009, the value of bitcoin has fluctuated, often wildly at times, as awareness and interest in the digital currency shifts. Over the last decade, bitcoin's value has experienced significant volatility with large gains followed by precipitous declines. In 2017, bitcoin surged from around $1,000 in January to nearly $20,000 by December of that year. In 2018, bitcoin went the other way, with prices dropping below $4,000. 2020 was another wild swing, with value ranging from $7,000 to over $28,000 by the end of the year. The momentum continued into 2021, with bitcoin reaching a peak of $69,000 in November. Then, in 2022, the value of bitcoin, along with other cryptocurrencies such as ethereum, dropped significantly during a period that is known as the crypto winter. At the time, bitcoin's price fell below $20,000 by the end of the year. However, 2023 marked a turnaround, with bitcoin closing the year at just over $42,000. 2024 has been a landmark year for Bitcoin, with several key events driving its price to new heights. In January, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) gave regulatory approval for cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds, including spot bitcoin ETFs. By March, bitcoin was trading at around $70,000. There was also a bitcoin halving event in April 2024, which also increased interest and value. Leading up to the U.S. presidential election, bitcoin's valuation was around $68,000 in Oct. 2024. After the election, bitcoin has been on a bull-run, reaching new highs almost daily. On Nov. 13, 2024, bitcoin hit a new all-time high of over $90,000, providing a lofty market capitalization of approximately $1.8 trillion USD. The Nov. 2024 surge in bitcoin's value can be attributed to several factors, each playing a crucial role in driving the cryptocurrency to new heights. However, the single biggest individual driver is the victory of President Trump in the U.S. general election on Nov. 4. Donald Trump's election victory has been a significant spark for bitcoin's price explosion. During the election campaign, at a bitcoin conference in Nashville, Tenn., Trump pledged to make the U.S. "the crypto capital of the planet." At the same event, Trump promised that if he was elected, he would appoint a cryptocurrency-friendly chairperson to the SEC. The idea under a Trump Administration is that there would be less regulation to limit cryptocurrency as well as more favorable policies put in place to support usage and adoption. As part of ensuring more cryptocurrency friendly policies are in place, Trump has also proposed creating a bitcoin and cryptocurrency presidential advisory council. The council will include individuals that are in favor of cryptocurrency. Going a step further, Trump has also stated that he would not allow the U.S. Federal Reserve to create its own digital currency. The pro-cryptocurrency stance and overall rhetoric coming from Trump has provided renewed confidence and exuberance to the price of bitcoin. The Trump win also led to an overall spike across U.S. stock markets in the days following the election. The Trump win provided additional momentum for bitcoin, on top of a series of other factors. In Jan. 2024, the SEC first allowed the creation of spot bitcoin ETFs. The Trump victory made those ETFs more popular with large inflows of new investor capital. On Nov. 11 and 12, bitcoin ETFs recorded the largest volume of capital inflows, since the ETF were first allowed in January. Approximately $2 billion of capital flowed into bitcoin ETF on those two days alone. The BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust is one of the biggest recipients of inflows with over $40 billion since the fund was created and is larger than any other ETF launched in the past decade. It is expected that overall the tech industry will see less regulation under a Trump administration. The process of deregulation could have a significant impact on cryptocurrency. Even the talk of deregulation has already played a part in the price gains for bitcoin in November. The prospect of deregulation under Trump's presidency has already driven bitcoin to record highs above $90,000, reflecting market optimism about a cryptocurrency-friendly regulatory environment As part of his campaign platform, Trump signaled plans to reduce regulation surrounding the cryptocurrency industry. Less regulation could mean more opportunities for cryptocurrency because there will be fewer restrictions. Trump's specific regulatory promises include the following: Another part of the Trump agenda that is helping to push bitcoin to all-time high price levels is the issue of taxes. There are several elements of the Trump agenda that will lower taxes and make cryptocurrency investing even more attractive to investors. Some of the proposed tax changes and their potential impact on the cryptocurrency market include the following: When bitcoin started, it wasn't easy for the average retail investor to get involved. That's no longer the case. As more individuals become comfortable with digital assets, the user base for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies continues to expand, driving up demand and prices. There are now multiple ways for retail investors to participate in the cryptocurrency market: Bitcoin isn't the only cryptocurrency to gain in value. Multiple other cryptocurrencies including Ethereum, Solana and even Dogecoin have all had big gains. The following table shows some of the gains: The outlook for cryptocurrency appears to be mostly optimistic, albeit with some uncertainties. Trump's pro-cryptocurrency agenda, including plans to establish a national bitcoin reserve, support U.S.-based mining and prevent the development of a central bank digital currency, could boost the cryptocurrency market. His promise to make the U.S. the "crypto capital" of the world might attract global innovators and investors. While the short-term market response has been positive, with bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies seeing significant gains, the long-term impact will depend on the actual implementation of these policies and broader economic factors. The implementation timeline for Trump's policies is uncertain. While the U.S. is an important market, the global regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies continues to evolve, which could impact the U.S. market regardless of domestic policies.

According to an analysis by the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, Trump’s plans will boost the debt by $7.75 trillion. While that’s not a "today problem" for investors, they're still grappling with what that increase could mean down the road. “I think markets tend to react to the shark closest to the boat,” Rick Rieder, chief investment officer for fixed income at BlackRock, told me at the Yahoo Invest conference this week. “The shark on the debt dynamic is not going to be next to the boat in January or February, but it is going to get next to the boat sometime. I don't know if it's the latter part of 2025 or the beginning of 2026, unless they address the size of the spending dynamics, the amount of debt we're issuing, and then obviously inflation relative to that.” Rieder laid out a scenario where “bond vigilantes” could attack. Essentially, if regular buyers of government Treasurys decide that Trump’s fiscal policies are inflationary, they could stage a strike, or sell en masse, driving up yields. That, in turn, would increase debt servicing costs for the US government and create a ripple effect throughout markets and the economy. Of course, US debt has been rising for years, and the federal government hasn’t had a surplus (with revenue exceeding spending) since the brief window between the end of the Clinton administration and the start of the George W. Bush administration. And markets have mostly looked the other way. John Stoltzfus of Oppenheimer invoked Bill Gross’s famous “cleanest dirty shirt” comparison when explaining why: “The US stands out because of our accountability, our transparency, governance, and also our capability to innovate and the size of our economy,” he said in a recent interview. That said, Stoltzfus, like most market participants, says federal debt will become a problem … eventually. For now, it’s more a discussion point than an economic obstacle.

Photo Credit: X/ @Tether_to Tether is targeting businesses and governments as customers Tether Holdings Ltd., the world's largest digital asset company, is getting into the tokenisation of stocks, bonds, funds and commodities. The platform Hadron by Tether, launched Thursday, will allow users to convert assets into products ranging from stablecoins that are pegged to fiat to digital tokens backed by commodities or other forms of collateral. The British Virgin Islands-registered company is targeting businesses and governments as customers, Tether said in a statement. Turning assets into tokens can allow them to be traded quicker and at a lower cost. The assets can be traded on blockchains by transferring them from one cryptocurrency wallet to another. These potential advantages led Wall Street companies like BlackRock Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Franklin Templeton to offer tokensed money market and mutual funds over the past couple years. Stablecoins, a form of crypto token pegged to another asset, use reserves to support their value. They are integral to the way crypto markets operate, acting as a less volatile alternative for traders looking to swap between digital assets and to store their wealth. Tether's stablecoin USDT, which is pegged to the dollar and backed by Treasuries and other assets, currently has over $126.6 billion tokens in circulation. The tokenisation platform is the latest effort by Tether to expand beyond its core business. The firm announced last week that it completed the funding of its first crude oil transaction in the Middle East as part of a plan to become a lender in commodities trading. The closely-held company has been the center of controversy in the past. Tether has previously faced fines from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and settled with the New York Authority General surrounding allegations that it lied about its reserves in the past and made misleading statements. © 2024 Bloomberg L.P.

Title: BlackRock's Gargi Chaudhuri shares how to invest as ETF inflows soar to records ahead of a promising 2025

Investors have poured money into the market at an unprecedented pace since Donald Trump's victory, though a veteran investment chief believes there's much more than politics at play. Inflows into exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have shattered the record set in 2021 with more than a month and a half to spare, according to asset management titan BlackRock. The world's largest ETF issuer recently noted that $77 billion went into ETFs in the week after the election, which had never happened before. That surge coincided with the S&P 500's best week of 2024. Markets were especially euphoric immediately after election day. An astounding $22.3 billion went into US ETFs last Wednesday, and BlackRock's uber-popular iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM) had its most active day of trading and inflows since 2007 as small caps soared by 5.8%. However, BlackRock's Gargi Chaudhuri doesn't think President-elect Trump deserves all the credit for this astounding market rally. The chief investment and portfolio strategist, Americas noted in a recent interview that US stocks had several strong catalysts before Trump's win. "Obviously, there have been some pretty sharp movements over the course of the last week," Chaudhuri told Business Insider. "But even as we look back to the quarter before that or since the beginning of this year, I think there have been some very solid fundamentals that have underpinned this movement." Robust growth for the economy and corporate earnings are some of the most salient market drivers, as are lower interest rates and receding inflation, Chaudhuri said. End-of-year rallies are also very common, especially in strong years for the market, as Truist recently remarked. Another convincing explanation for this recent market momentum is that investors had reduced risk as uncertainty mounted ahead of the election before quickly changing course when they got clarity on the path forward sooner and more decisively than anticipated. "Investors bringing down their portfolio risk going into elections was perhaps one of the reasons that we have seen this pretty strong re-risking in markets, especially after we got the election results," Chaudhuri said. As the new year approaches, Chaudhuri is rather confident about the US economy, even though a few recent developments seem to have given the glass-half-empty camp some ammunition. GDP growth and job additions have slipped lately, though neither is a major cause for concern for Chaudhuri. The economy didn't expand as much as expected in the third quarter, but GDP still rose at a healthy clip of 2.8%. And a weak October jobs figure appears to be largely due to the severe weather events that disrupted thousands of workers. Besides, more modest growth is a sign that the economy isn't overheating, which is welcome news to the Federal Reserve in its quest to ease financial conditions without reviving inflation. Such moderations aren't giving Chaudhuri pause about the trajectory of the US economy. "It would be very normal for us to continue to see a further normalization in the labor market, given how strong the economy has already been, how high rates are," Chaudhuri said. The investment chief added: "We haven't really seen that job destruction taking place quite yet. You're still seeing wages rising; you're not seeing layoffs pick up in a meaningful manner." Corporate earnings growth is arguably the most compelling reason to stick with US stocks following what's been another outstanding performance this year. Profits jumped about 7% in the third quarter, which is well above the mid-single-digit figure that analysts were banking on. "One of the things that the equity market has done over and over again is continue to surprise us in terms of earnings growth," Chaudhuri said. "I think companies have continued to find very innovative ways to manage their expenses. They've found a way, especially given the spend on AI, the type of CapEx that's going into finding ways to make companies have more productivity." Two sectors with abnormally strong earnings prospects are financials and industrials, Chaudhuri said. These economically sensitive groups enjoyed some of the larger post-election pops as Wall Street puts its chips on sectors that should benefit from a hot economy. And although smaller stocks have been on a heater, Chaudhuri believes that large, undervalued companies are the better place to be, given their superior earnings setup. "For a longer period of time, large cap is where we think the earnings growth is going to continue to be higher and better," Chaudhuri said. While earnings may not be under the microscope like they were when interest rates were at their peak, they're still top of mind for Chaudhuri. Larger stocks often have better earnings than their smaller peers, and the investment chief thinks that the cream will eventually rise to the top. "This catch-up trade that's happening in small caps right now has a little bit of legs," Chaudhuri said. "I think that can continue, maybe 'til the end of this month or even the end of next month." Chaudhuri continued: "But for us to believe in sustained rallies in small caps, we would need to see earnings growth, and over 50% of the small-cap index still is not very profitable." Jump to
