A major U.S.-based company discriminated against U.S. graduates while it used the H-1B visa program to place low-salary Indian graduates into U.S. white-collar jobs, according to a report in Bloomberg News. The company, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation, has repeatedly promised to hire more American graduates, but the pledges were “all smoke and mirrors,” said employee Sonya McLaughlin, a U.S. hiring manager. “The entire business model is built on the back of cheap Indian labor,” she told Bloomberg. “The [Indian] people who are on visas are the people Cognizant wants.” The article is titled “Insiders Tell How IT Giant Favored Indian H-1B Workers Over US Employees.” Bloomberg noted: In October, a jury in a federal class-action lawsuit returned a verdict that found Cognizant intentionally discriminated against more than 2,000 non-Indian employees between 2013 and 2022. The verdict, which echoed a previously undisclosed finding from a 2020 US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission investigation, centered on discrimination claims based on race and national origin. Cognizant, based in Teaneck, New Jersey, was found to have preferred workers from India, most of whom joined the firm’s US workforce of about 32,000 using … visas called H-1Bs. The article sheds some light on an emerging migration problem facing President Donald Trump. He has just been elected on a promise to shut down illegal migration and labor smuggling — but many of his business allies want to protect the inflow of Indian and Chinese college graduates into a huge variety of career-starting jobs needed by young American graduates. The Bloomberg article noted that Cognizant is expected to appeal the jury decision. “Cognizant provides equal employment opportunities for all employees and does not tolerate discrimination in any form,” said a company spokesman. “Cognizant complies with federal laws regarding pay for visa workers …. [and] disagrees that any financial incentive exists to hire visa workers,” the spokesman said. White-Collar Staffing Companies Companies are “offshoring nearly every [white collar] job in America because there is no labor market test” to determine if American graduates are available, said John Miano, a lawyer with the Center for Immigration Studies. President Joe Biden’s pro-migration deputies have accelerated white-collar outsourcing. For example, a major migration law firm reported on December 9: The Department of State (DOS) has released an update of the J-1 Exchange Visitor Skills List (“Skills List”) effective December 9, 2024. The revised list removes a large number of countries and broadens opportunities for current or former J-1 nonimmigrants to remain in or return to the United States. The Cognizant verdict and the Bloomberg article are “validation for what we’ve been doing for the past several years,” Kevin Lynn, founder of U.S. Tech Workers, told Breitbart News. He added: These employment visa programs were designed to displace American graduates, not bring in the best and brightest. There are plenty of [other visa] programs out there that do allow us to bring in the best and brightest, and what we will have to do is have that discussion with [business] groups that are saying they need more skilled immigrants. ‘What we’ll have to do is teach them how to invest in their American workforce and no longer discriminate against their American workforce,” he said, adding: They will be just fine. Innovation and productivity have been the big casualties of this “Indian Era of Displacement” because we have not brought in the best and the brightest. We brought in very ordinary workers, and so innovation and productivity have taken hits, and so has American competitiveness … We have large numbers of Indians who are now in management positions, hiring and promoting their own. That’s a huge hit to professionalism because it’s not a meritocracy. After-inflation salaries for U.S. graduates have stalled since 2000, even as housing prices have exploded, according to Stastista.com. Since 2008, “compensation grew at a rate of just 0.15 percent per year” for technology graduates, the Center for Immigration Studies reported on August 30. Meanwhile, business groups are demanding more white-collar migration. Many of the American graduates who are pushed off the career ladder by visa workers never regain their income or career prospects. The underlying problem, Lynn said, is that Wall Street and corporate managers want cheap labor for immediate profits. That policy destroys innovation, professionalism, and productivity at companies such as Boeing and Intel Corp. he said. “This efficiency model is what white-collar Americans have been suffering under for the last three decades,” Lynn said. In contrast, Elon Musk’s rocket business cannot use visa workers because of Cold War restrictions on the export of technology. The Bloomberg report includes comments and legal testimony from U.S. graduates who worked at Cognizant, For example, Abby Israel was hired to oversee the enforcement of anti-discrimination laws, Bloomberg wrote: In 2018, Israel’s team produced an internal report that found large racial disparities in rates of “involuntary terminations” at Cognizant over the first eight months of the year. Black employees were let go at a rate 23 times that of Asian [mostly Indian] workers, the data showed. For Hispanic or Latino employees, the rate was 16 times the rate of their Asian counterparts. For White workers, it was eight times as high. (The Asian workers were overwhelmingly from India and were working on [H-1B and other] visas, according to the report.) Israel told the jury that those were some of the most extreme racial disparities she’d ever seen. She also said that when she reached out to Cognizant’s hiring managers with those findings, her supervisor told her to stop sharing the data beyond HR leaders. The huge supply of compliant visa workers also allows C-Suite managers to ignore the advice of U.S. professionals. Bloomberg reported one example: When Christy Palmer joined Cognizant in 2013, she relished the opportunity to work at a multinational corporation that served some of the most iconic US companies. It wasn’t long before she began to feel out of place, uncomfortable and, at times, intimidated, she said during court proceedings and interviews with Bloomberg. At a client meeting in 2015, a Cognizant director was struggling to respond to questions about a report Palmer had written, so she tried to step in with an answer. According to Palmer and another person present, the director cut her off, swearing loudly at her to shut up. Numbers At least 250,000 new mid-skilled workers annually arrive seeking U.S. starter white-collar jobs. They come with H-1B, L-1, H4EAD, or L-1 work visas, with Optional Practical Training (OPT) work permits granted after college enrollment, or by using tourist visas to sneak past airport customs officers. Once in the United States, most of the migrants are absorbed by the many corrupt ethnic-hiring and job-selling networks that exclude millions of ordinary American graduates. Most of the visa workers are rented out to brand-name U.S. firms by many staffing agencies run by Indian managers. Both Facebook and Apple have been fined token sums after the federal government found evidence of discrimination against Americans. Foreign white-collar visa workers hold at least 2 million jobs that would otherwise go to young American graduates. The replacement workers are very profitable to tech investors who gain roughly $20 in stock value for every dollar saved in salaries. Cognizant is a staffing firm launched in India in 1994 by India-0rigin immigrants working for Wall Street’s Dun & Bradstreet. The company is now based in Teaneck, N.J., and the board reports mostly to the large-scale investors — including Vanguard and BlackRock — who own at least 50 percent of the company’s stock. Many lower-cost, mid-skilled Indian graduates who work for U.S. staffing firms expect to get U.S. residency and citizenship in exchange for years of hard work and low pay in the United States. In turn, India’s government uses diplomacy and trade deals to help export its graduates to U.S. jobs. It also works with allies — such as the India Caucus in Congress — to protect the white-collar staffing companies that are hired by Fortune 500 executives and investors. The lawsuit is Palmer v. Cognizant Tech. Solutions Corp., 17-cv-06848, US District Court, Central District of California in Los Angeles. Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting. Copyright © 2024 Breitbart

First Abu Dhabi Bank (FAB) has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Libre Capital, the tokenization specialist backed by WebN Group and Nomura’s Laser Digital, to do blockchain-based collateralized lending using real world asset (RWAs) tokens.Since going live in March, Libre has issued about $150 million of tokenized versions of Brevan Howard funds, Hamilton Lane's fixed-income type products, and a BlackRock money-market fund. Under the MoU, First Abu Dhabi Bank is piloting a credit line for approved lenders to provide stablecoin lending with those Libre issued tokens as collateral.Holders of all sorts of crypto assets enthusiastically use their tokens as collateral to borrow against. In this case Libre, which already proposed the use of its blue chip RWA tokens as collateral on a MakerDAO forum in September, has brought a $335 billion bank into the mix. FAB will be handling liquidity through lending credit lines on Libre’s assets on public chains like Ethereum, Polygon, Solana, NEAR, Aptos and Coinbase’s layer2 network BASE.Libre’s collateralized lending offering is part of an initiative the firm calls “Project HODL” (short for High-Yield Optimized Decentralized Liquidity).“We've been working on adding utility to our AUM in the form of collateralized lending,” said Dr. Avtar Sehra, founder and CEO of Libre in an interview. “Essentially it's an on-chain infrastructure that allows these RWAs to be used as collateral. The lending is all in stablecoins, not in fiat, and is being provided through existing lenders, like broker dealers, or Laser Digital, and now they are getting credit lines from providers like FAB.”At a signing of the MoU in the UAE, Sameh Al Qubaisi, group head of global markets at FAB said the Libre initiative underscores the bank’s commitment to drive innovation in the region.“Through this initiative, FAB aims to enable secure credit facilities backed by tokenized assets, with automated processes ensuring robust risk management and complete regulatory compliance,” AlQubaisi said in a statement.

Title: Market Reacts To Trump’s Crypto Support: Almost $10 Billion Invested In US Bitcoin ETFs
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/market-reacts-to-trumps-crypto-support-almost-10-billion-invested-in-us-bitcoin-etfs/
Time Published: 2024-12-10T08:00:41Z
Full Content:
Since Donald Trump became president-elect a little more than a month ago, roughly $10 billion has flooded into US spot Bitcoin ETFs, showing growing optimism that his administration will support the cryptocurrency industry. According to Bloomberg, a dozen funds from big issuers including BlackRock and Fidelity Investments have received around $9.9 billion in net inflows into their various Bitcoin ETFs since November 5, bringing their total assets to around $113 billion. Trump’s recent selections, such as a digital asset champion to lead the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the creation of a White House czar for artificial intelligence and crypto, indicate a shift toward a more friendly regulatory climate. Notably, Trump has praised the concept of establishing a national Bitcoin reserve, which is gaining bipartisan support in Congress, with pro-crypto Senator Cynthia Lummis at the lead. Bitcoin recently surpassed the $100,000 mark for the first time on December 5, trading at around $96,898 as of Monday. The cryptocurrency’s six-week winning streak is the longest since the market frenzy of 2021, but analysts remain concerned about volatility. David Lawant, head of research at crypto premier broker FalconX, noted that a sustained push above the $100,000 milestone will most likely necessitate other positive catalysts, as BTC has struggled to recapture this level while stabilizing after the advance over the last four days. Bloomberg also notes that the positive atmosphere surrounding cryptocurrencies has resulted in a substantial rebound among companies that have followed MicroStrategy’s strategy of selling convertible bonds to fund Bitcoin purchases. MicroStrategy alone sold $6.2 billion in convertibles this year and intends to raise an additional $21 billion through fixed-income offerings. Other companies, including MARA Holdings and Core Scientific, have successfully obtained significant funds to support their Bitcoin acquisitions. MicroStrategy’s stock, MSTR, has risen 73% since Donald Trump’s election, while MARA, Riot Platforms, and Core Scientific’s shares have increased by 63%, 33%, and 30%, respectively. This trend closely resembles Bitcoin’s nearly 40% growth within the same period. With a market capitalization approaching $2 trillion, Bitcoin’s recent ascent has dramatically increased MicroStrategy’s assets, which are now worth more than $41 billion. The terms of recent crypto-related convertible deals stand out, particularly because many are structured with zero coupons, allowing investors to engage in convertible arbitrage. Despite the high demand for these instruments, there appears to be little anxiety about prospective Bitcoin price decreases. Raj Imteaz, head of convertible and equity derivatives advisory at ICR Capital LLC, noted that larger players in the market feel compelled to issue convertibles to remain competitive. “If your competitor has a large war chest funded at very low coupons and you haven’t tapped the market, you’re at a competitive disadvantage,” he said. “You almost have to issue converts to stay competitive within crypto.” Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com Ronaldo is an experienced crypto enthusiast dedicated to the nascent and ever-evolving industry.

Title: Bitcoin slips below $100K as corporate interest soars: Is $120K the next target? (Prakash Bhudia)

Bitcoin fell slightly on Monday, cooling after a weekend rally that saw it reach a record high of $103,719 on December 4. By December 6, Bitcoin was trading at $98,658, marking a 13.53% pullback and wiping out over $1.5 billion in leveraged positions. While the dip highlights market volatility, BTC’s year-to-date (YTD) gains of 130% affirm its dominance as a key player in global finance. This retreat comes amid optimism over President-elect Donald Trump’s crypto-friendly policies, increased corporate interest in Bitcoin, and concerns over large-scale liquidations from Mt. Gox-related wallets. Bitcoin’s rally was fueled by expectations of regulatory clarity under Trump’s administration. The nomination of Paul Atkins as SEC Chair and pro-crypto picks for key economic positions signaled a potential boom for the digital asset sector. Trump has promised to make the U.S. the “crypto capital” of the world and floated the idea of a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve, sparking optimism despite skepticism over its feasibility. Amazon has emerged as the latest major company to consider adopting Bitcoin. During the 2025 shareholders meeting on December 6, shareholders petitioned Amazon’s board to explore adding Bitcoin to its balance sheet. With $88 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, Amazon is well-positioned to make a significant impact by diversifying into Bitcoin. Shareholders highlighted Bitcoin’s superior returns—131% over the past year and 1,246% over the last five years—compared to corporate bonds. The document also emphasized MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin-focused strategy, which has driven its stock to outperform Amazon by 537% over the past year, as a compelling precedent. These discussions come at a time when institutional interest in Bitcoin is rising sharply. The $2.4 billion inflows into Spot Bitcoin ETFs not only underscore Bitcoin’s growing acceptance but also make a strong case for corporate adoption. Major players like Tesla and Block have already added Bitcoin to their balance sheets, and Amazon’s institutional investors—such as BlackRock and Fidelity—are major proponents of Bitcoin ETFs. If Amazon moves forward, it could trigger a broader corporate trend, driving even greater demand for Bitcoin. Source: Coinglass Bitcoin’s retracement below $100,000 was driven by several market forces. Profit-taking played a significant role, with Chinese tech company Meitu selling 940 BTC and 31,000 ETH to realize $80 million in profits. This triggered broader selling pressure, leading to market liquidations of over $1.5 billion in leveraged positions, which further amplified the decline. Adding to the bearish sentiment, movements of $2 billion worth of coins from Mt. Gox wallets raised fears of a creditor distribution, potentially flooding the market with supply. Bitcoin’s volatility reignited debates between skeptics and advocates. Economist Peter Schiff dismissed the rally as being driven by government manipulation, claiming it lacked organic market support. However, crypto advocates countered his arguments, highlighting Bitcoin’s status as a truly free-market asset compared to gold, which often depends on government support. Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao celebrated the milestone and encouraged the community to remain focused, stating, “Keep building.” Despite its recent retreat, Bitcoin remains near its all-time highs, and analysts remain optimistic about recovery. Trump’s upcoming policy announcements, growing corporate adoption led by companies like Amazon, and Bitcoin’s robust market fundamentals suggest further potential for gains as 2024 draws to a close. Bitcoin’s retreat below $100K underscores its volatility but doesn’t overshadow its significance. It is no longer just a speculative asset—it is a cornerstone of financial innovation, challenging traditional systems and shaping the future of global finance. At the time of writing, BTC has dipped just below $100,000 with bullish signals still evident. However, RSI slightly dipping below 70 could be a hint for a pause on bullish momentum. Buyers could find a hurdle at the $104,000 mark with sellers potentially being held at the $96,000 and $92,160 support levels.

Title: Jobs fears raised raised but 'earthquake swarm' unmentioned as nuclear inquiry sits in NSW coal capital

(ABC News: Jake Lapham) A federal inquiry into nuclear energy has held a hearing in Muswellbrook in the NSW Upper Hunter region. Speakers discussed future employment, environmental concerns and expressed frustration with policy, but not the suitability of the region for a nuclear facility despite recent earthquakes. The inquiry will hold hearings in Lithgow and Sydney this week before moving to Western Australia. A nuclear energy inquiry has sparked an emotional debate about the economic future of Muswellbrook, the coal capital of New South Wales, but a spate of earthquakes in the region went unmentioned. The House Select Committee on Nuclear Energy is touring the country to investigate the viability of the federal Coalition's nuclear energy proposal. On Tuesday, it sat in Muswellbrook but there were no questions raised about the suitability of the area for nuclear power stations due to its high seismic activity. Coal mine closures are slated for the region and most of the discussion was about whether renewable projects or other energy sources such as nuclear could employ the thousands of coal workers likely to be impacted. Steve Reynolds believes in an energy mix that could include nuclear power. (ABC Upper Hunter: Romy Stephens) Former Muswellbrook mayor Steve Reynolds told the hearing he felt the majority of Muswellbrook locals were "quiet supporters" of nuclear. But he said that bringing in a "a balanced energy mix right across the system" – including nuclear energy – would be an effective way to protect the town's economy. "[That will provide] steady full-time jobs and is also protecting our farmland," Mr Reynolds said. Mining and Energy Union northern district secretary Robin Williams told the hearing he thought the Coalition's plan was "unrealistic" and would not "come to fruition". "None of our energy companies are interested in building nuclear power stations," he said. "The Coalition has engaged with energy culture wars … and I believe that is what they are continuing to do now." Since early August the Muswellbrook area has experienced several earthquakes, including four above magnitude 4. The Coalition's proposed nuclear power plan includes a reactor at the site of the former Liddell coal-fired power station, which is only a few kilometres away from the epicentre of the spate of quakes. A natural disaster declaration was issued to Muswellbrook Shire Council in early December, weeks after the "earthquake swarm" hit the town. But the Muswellbrook earthquakes were not mentioned at the hearing today. Former Bayswater coal-fired power station engineer Trevor Woolley, an opponent of the nuclear proposal, was one of the first to speak at the hearing. He said the debate around the region's energy future had deepened a social divide in the community. "[There is] so much fear, anger, false facts, driven by a very poor planning system," Mr Woolley said. Rosemary Hadaway told the inquiry that nuclear waste could have a devastating impact on future generations. (ABC Upper Hunter: Romy Stephens) Mudgee District Environment Group representative Rosemary Hadaway spoke about the environmental impact of waste if nuclear energy was pursued in Australia and said it would have a "reprehensible" impact on future generations. "What are we doing to our planet by creating this huge level of toxic pollution for many thousands of generations?" she asked. "We have no right to do that." Two of the town's Indigenous leaders questioned the long-term economic viability of the Hunter and what would replace coal jobs. Wonnarua Nation Aboriginal Corporation chief executive and mine rehabilitation worker Laurie Perry told the hearing nuclear did not make sense for communities on Wonnarua Country. He has called for more consultation on the proposal and shared his view that Indigenous people are often only briefly consulted for energy projects in their initial stages. "The only time we are engaged is when they want a mining lease, then we do the cultural and heritage work," he said. Blackrock Industries founder Steve Fordham told the inquiry the government had failed to help secure jobs. (ABC Upper Hunter: Romy Stephens) But the founder of miner Blackrock Industries, Steve Fordham, slammed the Albanese and former Coalition governments for not planning for the future sooner. The National Party member supports the nuclear idea as part of a mix of energy projects to sustain local jobs. "It’s war on our jobs — day in day out it’s getting tougher and tougher and tougher," he said. "The government has not had the balls to do anything. "We need investment, we need an opportunity." The inquiry will sit in WA after the hearings in NSW finish. (Unsplash: Nicolas HIPPERT/CC licence) Peter Dutton is expected to release costings of the Coalition's nuclear energy plan this week. He was spotted in the Muswellbrook community today but did not attend the inquiry. On Monday a CSIRO report concluded nuclear power would likely cost twice as much as renewable energy. The inquiry has recently visited regional South Australia and Victoria and two more hearings will take place in NSW before it moves to Western Australia.

The number of school-leavers from disadvantaged backgrounds progressing to college has climbed towards record levels. The figures are contained in the 2024 Irish Times Feeder School list, which provides a school-by-school guide of progression rates to third level this year. About 80 per cent of school-leavers nationally went to third level in 2024. The proportion of college-going students from Deis schools – typically located in more economically deprived areas – has climbed to 64 per cent. This is up from 57 per cent in 2019 and matches a record high of 63-64 per cent last recorded during the Covid pandemic, when students from Deis schools benefited to a greater extent from predicted grades. Among the likely factors behind the increase include the creation of additional college places, the growth of technological universities in regional areas, and access initiatives aimed at forging closer links between Deis schools and third-level colleges. [ Feeder Schools 2024: How did your school and county perform?Opens in new window ] To see all of our Feeder School tables broken down by gender and fee-paying and non-fee paying, scroll to the end of this page. Overall, Irish-medium schools or gaelcholáistí sent the highest proportion of school leavers to third level (96 per cent), followed by fee-charging schools (93 per cent), non-Deis schools (82 per cent) and Deis schools (64 per cent). When broken down by individual schools, the top 50 schools with the highest progression rates sent almost all their school-leavers to higher education. Coláiste Íosagáin, Booterstown, Co Dublin tops this year’s Feeder School 2024 list. It was followed by Sacred Heart Community School, Clonakilty, Co Cork; Coláiste Mhuire, Crosshaven, Co Cork; Jesus and Mary College, Goatstown, Co Dublin; Coláiste Chiaráin, Co Kildare; and Presentation College, Cork City. Schools with the highest progression rates are typically based in more affluent areas. Researchers say factors such as family education levels and access to private supports, such as grinds, can help boost pupils’ performance. Some schools recorded dramatic increases in the proportion of school-leavers who have gone to university over the past five years. For example, third-level progression rates at Ballinode Community College, Sligo, jumped by the highest amount of any school between 2018 and 2024 (up 66 per cent). It is followed by Ardscoil Phádraig, Co Longford (51 per cent), Dominican College, Blackrock, Co Dublin (47 per cent) and Holy Child Community School, Sallynoggin, Co Dublin (44 per cent). This year’s Feeder School lists also show how the class gap in third-level participation persists, especially in Dublin postal districts. For example, the most affluent parts of the capital, such as Dublin 6 – which includes Ranelagh – recorded third-level progression rates among school leavers of almost 100 per cent. This compares with college progression rates of 49 per cent in Dublin 10 – which includes Ballyfermot – and 56 per cent in Dublin 11, which includes Finglas. The class gap is even more stark when the figures are broken down into those who sat the Leaving Cert in 2024 and secured places in traditional universities, which tend to have higher CAO entry requirements. In Dublin 6, some 68 per cent went on to a traditional university, compared with 26 and 33.1 per cent in Dublin 10 and 11. The feeder school 2024 data does not capture the proportion of students who may have gone on to secure apprenticeships or places in further education. While The Irish Times has sought this information, education authorities say it is not systematically collected. Overall, this year’s numbers cement Ireland’s exceptionally high third-level participation rate, which is among the highest in the world. Ireland also continues to have one of the highest retention rates at second level across Europe, or the proportion of students who stay in school until the Leaving Cert.

Title: China Evergrande liquidators put founder’s private jet up for sale

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. Evergrande founder Hui Ka Yan was once China's richest man. Photo / AFP Evergrande’s liquidators are trying to sell an Airbus private jet that belonged to the collapsed property developer’s founder, as they attempt to salvage some returns for the overseas investors who bought billions of dollars of the company’s bonds. Alvarez & Marsal specialists Edward Middleton and Tiffany Wong, who were appointed to liquidate Evergrande’s Hong Kong-listed holding company in January, have taken control of the offshore entity that bought Hui Ka Yan’s jet and have put the jet up for sale, three people with knowledge of the matter said. The plane, a business jet variant of the Airbus A319, which is the size of a commercial passenger jet, is in Guangzhou in southern China, according to flight records. The plane was one of several markers of wealth Hui amassed as he became one of the richest men in China during the company’s boom years, embodying a new breed of splashy Chinese tycoons. The liquidators’ move sets up a test of their ability to enforce their ownership of assets in mainland China, whose legal system differs from the Hong Kong regime under which they were appointed. Any successful sale would mark an early sign of progress by liquidators trying to return cash to investors exposed to the more than US$20 billion ($34.2b) in offshore debt Evergrande had when it defaulted in 2021, debt now almost worthless at current prices. Once China’s biggest property developer, Evergrande had more than US$300b in total liabilities when it defaulted, precipitating a broader cash crunch in the country’s property sector. Hui bought mansions in London, Sydney and Hong Kong as well as a 60-metre megayacht and a football team, Guangzhou Evergrande. In 2017 he topped the Forbes China rich list with a total net worth of nearly US$43b. A Hong Kong judge in January ordered the winding up of Evergrande’s holding company in the territory, where it listed in 2009. Evergrande said last year Hui had been placed under “mandatory measures” on suspicion of involvement in “illegal crimes”. Hui could not be reached for comment. Alvarez & Marsal declined to comment. The private jet, which is now 14 years old and in need of some repair and maintenance work, was “bigger [and] more expensive to operate” than many other private jets, said Jason Liao, chairman and chief executive of China Business Aviation Group. He estimated it would be worth about US$25 million to US$30m, compared with about US$90m when new. Funds managed by BlackRock and HSBC were among those exposed to Evergrande bonds when it defaulted in 2021. The liquidators are also trying to recoup funds by bringing lawsuits against Evergrande’s executives and the global professional services firms that helped enable its rapid growth by accessing foreign funding. They have launched court proceedings against Big Four audit firm PwC, commercial real estate services company CBRE and advisory group Avista Valuation Advisory. PwC and CBRE declined to comment and Avista did not respond to requests to comment. They are trying to recover US$6b from Hui and other top company executives in a separate suit. In March, the China Securities Regulatory Commission accused Hui and Evergrande’s mainland business of inflating revenues by US$78b over 2019 and 2020. The plane is one of three private jets listed among Hui’s assets in court filings from March this year. The filings said he also owned an Airbus A330 and a Gulfstream G450 jet as well as two yachts and two Rolls-Royce Phantoms. © Financial Times Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read.

Title: Why Is Nordson Corporation (NDSN) Among the Best Dividend Kings to Invest In For Safe Dividend Growth?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 8 Best Dividend Kings To Invest In For Safe Dividend Growth. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Nordson Corporation (NASDAQ:NDSN) stands against the other dividend kings. Investors often focus on stock price movements, anticipating gains, but may underestimate the value of dividends as a key component of returns. This becomes particularly attractive when looking at companies with a history of steadily increasing their dividends. That’s where Dividend Kings come into play. These businesses have consistently raised their payouts for at least 50 years. Achieving this milestone is no small feat, with only around 54 out of thousands of publicly traded US companies earning this distinction. This dividend growth can be attributed to the solid financial positions of many high-quality companies. Since the pandemic began, these reserves have steadily increased, as a strong economy has allowed businesses to save more and earn returns on short-term investments. According to an analysis by the Carfang Group, based on the Federal Reserve's quarterly flow of funds, US companies increased their cash holdings in the first quarter of 2024, reaching a record $4.11 trillion. This growth, supported by a resilient economy and relatively high interest rates, marked a 12.6% increase from the same period last year and was $1.28 trillion higher than pre-pandemic levels. Recent trends also showed that companies have been shifting more of their investments toward corporate and US government debt, according to Clearwater Analytics, which analyzed nearly 400 corporate portfolios with assets totaling just under $1 trillion. Despite this shift, most funds remain allocated to cash or cash-equivalent instruments, which delivered annualized returns exceeding 5.48% in May, as reported by Clearwater. Also read: 8 Best Dividend Paying Debt Free Stocks to Invest in Focusing on dividend growth reveals its significant appeal over the years. Stocks known for consistent dividend increases have performed exceptionally well, with the Dividend Aristocrats index standing out as a key benchmark. This index, which tracks companies with a minimum of 25 consecutive years of dividend growth, has consistently delivered strong returns, often surpassing other asset classes despite market fluctuations. ProShare emphasized the index’s value for income-focused investors, noting its history of outperforming the broader market while exhibiting lower volatility since its inception. Their report highlighted that a $10,000 investment in the index in May 2005 could have grown to over $61,000 by March 2023. The report also mentioned that the index outperformed the market during eight of the ten largest quarterly declines since 2005. In addition to shareholder returns, dividend stocks have played a pivotal role in driving overall market performance, delivering substantial contributions. A report from T. Rowe Price highlighted that compounded dividends accounted for over 70% of global market returns. Similarly, the Harvard Business Review revealed that dividends made up nearly 37% of corporate earnings between 2003 and 2012. Consistently maintaining dividend payouts is a significant challenge for companies, even more so than increasing them regularly. Analysts caution against falling for yield traps—stocks that offer high yields but have unreliable dividend policies. Brian Bollinger, president of Simply Safe Dividends, emphasized the importance of prioritizing quality over yield in dividend investing during an interview with CNBC. He advised focusing on high-quality companies that typically offer dividend yields of around 3% to 4%. These businesses often demonstrate consistent growth in their dividend payments, providing a steady income stream while mitigating the effects of inflation. Additionally, he noted that lower-yield stocks are generally safer, with more dependable payout structures. Given this, we will discuss some of the best dividend kings for safe dividend growth. Our Methodology: For this article, we scanned the list of dividend kings, which are the companies that have raised their payouts for 50 years or more. From that list, we picked 8 companies with the highest 5-year annual average dividend growth rates. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of their annual average dividend growth in the past five years. We also considered hedge fund sentiment around each stock in Insider Monkey’s database, as of the third quarter of 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A wide-angle shot of an automated optical inspection system. 5-Year Average Annual Dividend Growth Rate: 14.55% Nordson Corporation (NASDAQ:NDSN) ranks second on our list of the best dividend kings. The multinational company designs and produces dispensing equipment used for applying adhesives, sealants, coatings, and other materials.

The Advanced Technology Solutions segment experienced sequential growth compared to the second quarter, driven by steady improvements in order entry within electronics end markets. Throughout the organization, strong operational execution resulted in robust gross margins and an impressive 31% EBITDA margin. Nordson Corporation (NASDAQ:NDSN)'s cash position came in strong in the most recent quarter. The company ended the quarter with over $165.3 million available in cash and cash equivalents, up from $115.6 million in the prior-year period. Its operating cash flow came in at $460 million. Nordson Corporation (NASDAQ:NDSN) currently offers a quarterly dividend of $0.78 per share, having raised it by 14.7% in August this year. This marked the company's 61st consecutive year of dividend growth. Moreover, in the past five years, it has raised its payouts at an annual average rate of 14.55%. The stock's dividend yield on December 9 came in at 1.22%. Nordson Corporation (NASDAQ:NDSN) was included in 18 hedge fund portfolios at the end of Q3 2024, compared with 21 in the previous quarter, as per Insider Monkey's database. The stakes held by these funds have a collective value of over $68.3 million. Among these hedge funds, Schonfeld Strategic Advisors was the company's leading stakeholder in Q3. Overall NDSN ranks 2nd on our list of the best dividend kings to invest in for safe dividend growth. While we acknowledge the potential for NDSN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NDSN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where AppLovin Corporation (NASDAQ:APP) stands against the other buzzing AI stocks. This year, artificial intelligence played a key role in two Nobel Prizes for scientific achievement. One prize was awarded for developing the technology, while the other was for its application. These two Nobel Prize wins clarify that AI is here to stay. However, key issues such as regulations, ethical use, and other potential risks, still need to be resolved for responsible and sustainable integration into society. READ NOW: Top 10 AI News Stories For The Weekend and 15 Buzzing AI Stocks Making Headlines On Saturday, December 7, Physics Nobel Prize winner Geoffrey Hinton and Chemistry laureate Demis Hassabis asserted the need for strong regulation of artificial intelligence, having played a key role in their awards. "AI is a very important technology to regulate but I think it's very important that we get the regulations right and I think that's the hard thing at the moment is it's such a fast moving technology”. According to Hassabis, having jointly won the Nobel Prize with Americans David Baker and John Jumper for revealing the secrets of proteins through AI, the main issue is defining the purpose, deployment, and making sure that artificial intelligence benefits all of humanity. In this regard, British-Canadian Hinton, considered the "Godfather of AI”, said he wished he had thought about safety earlier, reflecting his worries about how AI could potentially escalate the arms race. He gained attention last year after he left Google to warn against risks of AI outsmarting people someday, and was awarded a Nobel Prize along with American John Hopfield for work on artificial neural networks. President-elect Donald Trump has vowed deregulation and also shared his views to rescind President Joe Biden’s executive order on AI after he takes office in January. Nevertheless, it is still yet to unfold how he will approach AI regulation in particular. Trump has already appointed David Sacks as the AI and crypto czar, showcasing his proactive stance on advancing artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency innovation. In light of this, Axios reported that the US government has approved the export of advanced artificial intelligence chips to a facility in the United Arab Emirates as part of the company's highly-scrutinized partnership with Emirati AI firm G42. There were concerns raised about the transfer of sensitive technology to China, and the approved export license includes strict conditions to prevent access to the facility by personnel from nations under U.S. arms embargoes or those listed on the U.S. Bureau of Industry and Security's Entity List.

On December 6, Citi raised the firm’s price target on AppLovin (APP) to $460 from $335 and kept a “Buy” rating on the shares. The firm is bullish on the company’s growth prospects, particularly in mobile gaming and eCommerce. As a result, it has slightly raised its forecast and recalibrated its target multiple to accurately reflect the company’s peer group and growth prospects. The management has also pointed out the company’s model enhancements, which is supported by AppLovin's AI-driven tools like Axon 2.0, the company’s advertising platform that optimizes ad targeting and performance. In addition, early traction from the firm’s push into eCommerce, also heavily reliant on AI, and the potential scope to improve conversion rates, were also highlighted. Overall APP ranks 5th on our list of the buzzing AI stocks that are making headlines. While we acknowledge the potential of APP as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Title: After Four Years And Billions Of Dollars, The Texas Grid Is Not Fixed

HOUSTON, TX - FEBRUARY 18: People line up at a propane gas station to refill their tanks after ... [+] winter weather caused electricity blackouts on February 18, 2021 in Houston, Texas. Winter storm Uri brought severe temperature drops causing a catastrophic failure of the power grid in Texas. About two million people are without electricity throughout Houston. (Photo by Go Nakamura/Getty Images) Texas has spent years tweaking its electric grid, but it’s still not fixed. How do we know this? ERCOT, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, projects an 80% likelihood of rolling blackouts if a storm the magnitude of Winter Storm Uri hits the state this winter. Prior to Uri in February 2021, the probability of rolling blackouts was only 5%. A weaker storm—equivalent to 2022’s Winter Storm Elliott—has a 50% probability of triggering rolling blackouts. And there is no assurance that rolling blackouts can be executed, risking a widescale grid failure. So, by ERCOT’s own projections, the grid is more fragile than it was four years ago. Why? In 2002, Texas dispensed with a reliable end-to-end electricity supply chain that the consumer could count on in the heat of summer and cold of winter. It has been replaced by a 100% government operated grid under which consumers pay more, get less, and no one can be held accountable. Since 2021, electricity demand has continued to grow, and while supply from renewable resources and batteries has grown too, it cannot match demand at night. There are not enough natural gas, coal, and nuclear power plants, along with long duration batteries, to keep Texans warm during long, very cold winter nights. While some in Austin blame this problem on federal subsidies tilting the playing field towards renewable energy, the facts tell a different story. First, years before wind and solar farms proliferated in Texas, the ERCOT market design did not reward capital investment by power plant operators. Second, ERCOT is “an arm of the state,” according to the state’s highest court. ERCOT, not the federal government, controls entry to its grid. So, if wind and solar farms are a problem, they are a problem because the state let them become a problem. Finally, the state of Texas rewards gaming by allowing extreme price gouging, which has cost Texans billions of dollars. The questions for the Texas Legislature start with, Who do you work for? The billionaire energy oligarchs or 30 million Texans? If the ERCOT grid fails again, how will you react to a federal takeover in the name of national security by President Trump? Of all the states that are critical to the national economy and national security, Texas is at the top of the list. What’s the cost to date? In 2021, both The Wall Street Journal and KPRC-2 television in Houston reported that ERCOT consumers had paid $28 billion more than they would have been expected to pay had the market remained a cost-of-service plus allowable return on investment for the utilities—a system that allowed power generators to be paid for investing in maintenance and new generating capacity. Instead, the system encourages generators to hold back power from the grid until tight conditions force wholesale prices to rise, sometimes dramatically, with consumers paying the price. During the five-day February 2021 freeze, spiraling wholesale prices led ERCOT to overcharge its customers by more than $4.2 billion. In 2023, the ERCOT Independent Market Monitor stated that ERCOT overcharged the consumer side of the market by $12 billion from June through December, 2023. No new power plants have been built in exchange for this $12 billion. That money went to executive bonuses and stock buybacks. Who is responsible? ERCOT was named a defendant in hundreds of lawsuits filed following Winter Storm Uri. The Texas Supreme Court ruled that ERCOT is immune from lawsuits under the doctrine of sovereign immunity because—in carefully chosen language echoing that of the Soviet Union—ERCOT is “an arm of the state.” Utilities and power plant owners have been dismissed as defendants after arguing that ERCOT failed, or that other power plants failed, or that natural gas supplies failed, and that because the state manages everything about the ERCOT grid, these individual utilities and power plant owners bore no responsibility. It was an easy argument. None of the generators are responsible to individual customers because they only provide electricity to ERCOT. If the electricity was not delivered to consumers, therefore, it was the fault of the state of Texas. The Third Court of Appeals overturned the February 2021 overcharge. But, in a move that has never happened anywhere else in the United States, the Public Utility Commission of Texas, PUCT, at the direction of Gov. Greg Abbott, went to court to make sure that consumers had to pay the overcharge. ERCOT is not a “deregulated” market Following a deadly freeze in 2011, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission spoke up, stating that “…shedding load in the winter places lives and property at risk.” In response, Texas did nothing to change things. In 2013, my colleague Paul MacAvoy and I detailed the design flaws of the ERCOT electricity market and noted that it would inevitably fail because electricity suppliers could not earn a return on capital investment. The state, however, persisted with ERCOT’s anticapitalistic design and daily operation. No one can claim the ERCOT market is deregulated when it is 100% operated by the state of Texas. Every day, ERCOT is the one buyer in the wholesale market, operating like any other government agency buying pencils and office chairs. It is also the one seller in the wholesale market, raking its fees off the top, and billing retailers for electricity daily. Consumers do not interact directly with the wholesale market. They must buy electricity through PUCT-licensed retailers, who do not own power plants and who are not required to have electricity supplies lined up to service their customers. This contrasts with the old days in Texas when a consumer bought electricity from a vertically integrated utility, and the PUCT made sure that the utility had the electricity generation capacity available to meet the demands of new customers. The utility and the PUCT worked together to make sure that the utility was making the necessary investments. But today, retailers can sign up customers willy-nilly, without knowing whether there is sufficient supply capacity in ERCOT. With more people moving to Texas and a growing economy, and the increased risk of winter blackouts in ERCOT, electricity retailers are selling empty promises. They are running a Ponzi scheme because they can do so without any consequences. If they come up short like they did in 2021, the state will bail them out. Read that as private profit and socialized costs. Apart from selling something they don’t own, the retailers also make money by offering a confusing myriad of plans in full view of their competitors (see the PUCT’s website PowerToChoose.org). They publish their prices much like the airlines do on reservation services or gasoline stations along the road. While some may call this competition, it is remarkably easy for them to collude. The proposed solution fails on many levels The state has proposed solutions, including the adoption by ERCOT and the PUCT of an untried plan called a “Performance Credit Mechanism,” intended to compensate generators for providing electricity during tight market conditions. The plan, which has a hard cap on the payments, requires retailers to contract with generators. This approach using contracts attempts to reconstitute the vertically integrated utilities. But Texas had already thrown in the towel on its market design by allowing generator companies to acquire retailers such as NRG owning Reliant Energy. The PCM can only work if there is sufficient capacity for peak demand periods and there is 100% compliance across ERCOT. Neither of these requirements exist today. ERCOT’s antiquated portfolio of coal and natural gas power plants virtually guarantees that supply will be short as ERCOT’s rate of unplanned power plant outages is the highest in the nation. And the incentive for power plant operators to withhold electricity to drive the wholesale price from 5-cents per kilowatt hour to $5 per kilowatt hour is too great. As one power plant operator admitted on social media: “Ed, with prices you need to withhold. We have supply and demand functioning well. Get rewarded for being on during peak times.” Texas consumers should beg to differ. Texas government ignores the easy solutions The first, best solution following the 2021 freeze was to build new natural gas power plants. Even the state of California commissioned new natural gas power plants in 2020 after power supplies in that state ran short. Texas state government turned down offers from Berkshire Hathaway Energy and Starwood Energy Capital that, for approximately $10 billion, would have added up to 10,000 megawatts of new capacity—not for free of course, the companies asked for a 9 percent rate of return. Those power plants would have been operating today. No one will build new natural gas power plants for ERCOT without making sure a rate of return is available. BlackRock rebuffed pleas by Gov. Abbott and Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick to invest $10 billion in new power plants last March. To illustrate the investment thesis, CPS, the city of San Antonio’s municipal utility, was able to buy two relatively new natural gas power plants for approximately 50% of the new build cost. It follows that BlackRock is not going to invest $10 billion just to have something that is worth $5 billion. Low interest loans from the Texas Energy Fund cannot overcome the lack of equity investment for new power plants. Incumbent power plants will ask for loans to extend the operating lives of their old coal and natural gas power plants, but that does not expand supply. The second fast fix has always been a systemwide demand response program, where ERCOT would pay consumers to reduce electricity use during periods of peak demand. ERCOT already does this for cryptocurrency miners, paying them to reduce power use when the grid is strained. But regular Texans have had smart meters in their homes and businesses for more than 10 years. The technology is proven. During the summer of 2022, California sent out texts requesting that consumers opt-out on peak afternoons. More than one million did—and they did it without getting anything in exchange. Why has the Texas government not adopted demand response for consumers after all this time? Doing so would lessen the wild volatility in electricity prices, which range as high as $5 per kilowatt hour wholesale. It also would cut into profitability for generators and commodities traders who play against consumers during tight supply days. Millions of Texans could save billions on their electric bills if just a few hundred thousand customers opt out during peak demand for cheap side payments. Texas government preys on its citizens It’s not Republican vs. Democrat. Democrats run the states of California and New York, where there are dysfunctional grids. But the Republicans in charge of Texas have made it clear they do not care about the voter or consumer. That should change by 2026. Polling from the Texas Politics Project at the University of Texas at Austin shows that grid reliability is a top concern of Texas voters. Texas replaced its reliable end-to-end electricity supply chain with a severely fragmented system that is 100% government operated. No one can be held accountable. It is exactly like a government bureau out of the old Soviet Union down to its antiquated, computer driven input-output algorithm. Imagine that. One can forgive journalists, engineers, and lobbyists for not appreciating the irony, but the elected leaders of Texas should have learned about comparative government and economic systems in high school and college. Texas “deregulation” replaced government oversight of a capitalist driven electricity supply chain with direct government control. Beyond those structural problems, other factors are driving up electric bills for Texans. The addition of solar and wind farms brings needed new capacity but also requires an extensive buildout of transmission facilities to bring that electricity from rural areas to the state’s urban centers. Local utilities such as Austin Energy and CenterPoint Energy are also adding cleanup costs from storms and further costs necessary to harden their local distribution infrastructure to customers’ bills. President-elect Donald Trump has often called high energy prices a tax on living, and by that measure, the Texas ERCOT market leads the nation in taxing life. Trump has pledged to cut electricity rates by 50% during his first 18 months in office, but he will not be able to change anything in Texas because the ERCOT grid is not subject to federal oversight or regulation. Texas broke it. Texas needs to fix it. That is the job of the Texas Legislature. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Best Wind Power and Solar Stocks To Invest In Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NextEra Energy Inc. (NYSE:NEE) stands against other best wind power and stocks to invest in now. According to a report by the World Economic Forum published on November 8, the US election result is expected to have a significant impact on the transition to renewable energy sources. Solar and wind energy stocks fell sharply following the election, as Donald Trump's victory is anticipated to have a negative short-term impact on current climate policies. The president-elect has proposed policies that include increasing natural gas pipelines, ending offshore wind energy projects, and boosting fossil fuel production by easing restrictions on drilling on federal lands. He has also expressed intentions to withdraw the US from the Paris climate agreement and to support nuclear energy production. Despite these challenges, analysts predict that the boom in renewable energy in the US is unlikely to be dramatically slowed. The Inflation Reduction Act passed during the outgoing administration, is expected to inject $1 trillion of spending into green energy, with estimates that 85% of the money has gone to districts that elected Republicans. This financial support, along with existing opposition to the curtailment of renewable energy, suggests that the long-term trajectory of the energy transition remains uncertain but potentially resilient.

In an interview with CNBC on November 13, Will Rhind, CEO of GraniteShares, discussed the potential implications of a Trump presidency on renewable energy such as wind and solar. Rhind noted that the playbook on energy policy was already seen in the previous Trump administration. The Trump administration has historically been more supportive of fossil fuels and less focused on renewable energy. Therefore, stocks and sectors favored by the Biden administration, such as solar and wind, might see a downturn. Rhind suggested that the overall narrative may seem like it's shifting back toward traditional energy sources. However, Elon Musk seems to be playing an integral role in the Trump administration, and he has been a proponent of climate policies, with his electric vehicle (EV) industry and other businesses, which suggests that energy transition policies may not be as impactful as some might expect today. While the outcome of the US election and the anticipated policies of the new administration pose short-term challenges to renewable energy, the long-term outlook remains cautiously optimistic. To compile our list of the 10 best wind power and solar stocks to invest in now, we used clean energy ETFs plus online rankings to compile an initial list of 20 wind and solar energy stocks.

Title: Why Mueller Industries (MLI) Is Among the Best Dividend Paying Debt Free Stocks to Invest in

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 8 Best Dividend Paying Debt Free Stocks to Invest in. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Mueller Industries, Inc. (NYSE:MLI) stands against the other best debt free stocks that pay dividends. Debt financing is not inherently negative; its impact largely depends on how effectively it is utilized. When managed properly, it can drive substantial cash flow and enhance returns for shareholders. However, poor management of debt can weaken a company’s financial stability. In the second quarter, corporate debt levels decreased despite benchmark interest rates remaining unchanged between April and June. Total debt for both investment-grade and non-investment-grade companies fell to $8.432 trillion, down from $8.517 trillion in the previous quarter. Investment-grade companies reduced their debt by approximately 0.9% to $6.610 trillion, while those rated below BBB- by S&P Global Ratings lowered their debt by about 1.2% to $1.822 trillion, based on data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. READ ALSO: 10 Dividend Knights that Beat The Market Last 3 Years The S&P Global report also highlighted that while total debt among U.S. investment-grade companies declined overall, seven out of 10 nonfinancial sectors experienced debt growth in the second quarter. The energy sector recorded the largest increase, with total debt rising by 4.1% to $502.03 billion. However, this increase was largely offset by a significant 12.7% drop, equivalent to $98.87 billion, in debt within the information technology sector. For non-investment-grade companies, debt decreased across eight of the 10 sectors, with consumer staples experiencing the steepest decline at 7.7%. Conversely, total debt rose only in the healthcare and energy sectors within this category. While many US companies maintain strong balance sheets, a significant share of defaults has come from low-rated firms with negative cash flow, high debt levels, and limited liquidity. These heavily indebted businesses, often referred to as “zombies,” struggle to stay afloat, barely covering their loan interest payments, and are vulnerable to even minor setbacks. An analysis by the Associated Press found that nearly 7,000 publicly traded companies globally, including 2,000 in the U.S., fall into this category. These firms were impacted by years of accumulating inexpensive debt, followed by persistent inflation that pushed borrowing costs to their highest levels in a decade. Additionally, much of the borrowed funds were not directed toward growth initiatives like expansion, hiring, or technological investment but were instead used for stock buybacks. Financial analysts have pointed out that U.S. companies have not taken sufficient steps to reduce their long-term debt, leading to a worsening situation. For the first time, annual interest expenses have exceeded $1 trillion, reaching $1.16 trillion in 2024. According to a Treasury official, the average interest rate on government debt increased to 3.32% in 2024, compared to 2.97% the previous year. The Congressional Budget Office projects that the national debt, currently near 100% of GDP, will climb to 122% by 2034. Using debt to support dividends is typically viewed unfavorably, especially in light of practices observed during the 2020 pandemic. At that time, many private companies turned to dividend recapitalization, borrowing funds to maintain dividend payouts. The trend persisted in 2024 as well. As of September 30, 2024, US companies, including those not supported by private equity, have secured a record $70.2 billion in leveraged loans for dividend recapitalizations, based on data from PitchBook. This amount surpasses the $67.2 billion recorded in 2021, the previous high point for such activity. That said, many companies have maintained stable balance sheets, with US firms consistently setting new records for dividend payments year after year. A worker welding a pipe joint in a metal fabrication facility. To create this list, we first used a screener and identified companies with minimal or no debt. From this pool, we selected those that consistently pay dividends to shareholders and compared their enterprise value (EV) to their market capitalization to gauge which ones are debt-free. We then narrowed down the list by including stocks that had sustainable dividend yields. From that list, we picked 8 companies with the highest number of hedge funds having stakes in them, as per Insider Monkey's database of Q3 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 27 Market Cap as of December 7: $8.95 billion Enterprise Value as of December 7: $8.02 billion Mueller Industries, Inc. (NYSE:MLI) ranks second on our list of the best debt free stocks that pay dividends. The American machinery industry company manufactures a wide range of products for industrial markets. The company has attracted investors' interest due to strong operational improvements, favorable market conditions, and its undervalued position relative to competitors. MLI, a leader in essential but often overlooked markets, produces basic components for water infrastructure, HVAC, and industrial applications. The company benefits from a well-balanced business model, with its piping systems segment contributing the majority of its operational profits and revenues. The stock is up nearly 69% YTD. In the third quarter of 2024, Mueller Industries, Inc. (NYSE:MLI) posted revenues of $997.8 million, which jumped by 21.7% from the same period last year. The company's operating income came in at $206.7 million, up from $181 million in the prior-year period. The rise in net sales was driven by $102.4 million in sales from recently acquired businesses, along with the increase in copper prices. Mueller Industries, Inc. (NYSE:MLI) has been growing its dividends for the past four years. The company currently offers a quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share and has a dividend yield of 1.02%, as of December 7. Of the 900 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey at the end of Q3 2024, 27 funds owned stakes in Mueller Industries, Inc. (NYSE:MLI), up from 25 in the previous quarter. The overall value of these stakes is more than $424.7 million. Among these hedge funds, GAMCO Investors was the company's leading stakeholder in Q3. Overall, MLI ranks 2nd on our list of the best debt free stocks that pay dividends. While we acknowledge the potential for MLI to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Autonomous Driving Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) stands against the other best autonomous driving stocks to buy. The vision of fleets of driverless cars seamlessly transporting passengers has captivated consumers and driven billions in investment over recent years. Imagine summoning a driverless car with a tap on your phone, enjoying a stress-free, congestion-free commute. After years of anticipation and extensive development, self-driving car technology is finally becoming a reality. Vehicles equipped with advanced driver-assist systems (ADAS) and partial self-driving capabilities are now hitting the market, signaling the start of the race toward full autonomy. Simultaneously, the robotaxi market is maturing, with commercial driverless services now active across the U.S. and China. Leading players in this space collectively operate over 2,000 robotaxis, gathering data to refine AI systems, ensuring safety, and serving mobility-as-a-service customers. According to IDTechEx, the autonomous vehicles market is poised for rapid growth, with projections indicating robotaxi vehicle sales could reach $174 billion by 2045, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 37% starting in 2025. According to a 2021 McKinsey survey, consumers are eager for autonomous driving (AD) features and willing to pay a premium. Ranked from Level 0-5 based on capabilities, growing demand for these systems could unlock billions in revenue. While vehicles equipped with Level 2 autonomy are widely known, the firm projects that widespread adoption of vehicles equipped with Level 4 capabilities will begin around 2026, with initial applications expected to focus on autonomous parking, with highway driving following shortly thereafter. Overall, McKinsey projects that the ADAS and AD market for passenger cars could generate $300 billion to $400 billion by 2035. The firm also highlights the far-reaching impact autonomous vehicles could have on various industries. For instance, by significantly reducing car accidents, advanced driver technology could lower the demand for roadside assistance and vehicle repairs, potentially challenging businesses in those sectors as adoption increases. Additionally, self-driving cars may eliminate the need for high insurance premiums, as liability for accidents could shift away from individual drivers. This could pave the way for new business-to-business insurance models tailored to autonomous travel. Adding momentum, Bloomberg reports that President-elect Donald Trump’s transition team plans to prioritize a federal framework for self-driving vehicles within the Transportation Department. Currently, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) permits manufacturers to deploy 2,500 self-driving vehicles annually under exemptions. However, broader adoption of autonomous vehicles will likely require congressional action to establish comprehensive guidelines. Grayson Brulte, founder of The Road to Autonomy, a data and analysis firm specializing in self-driving technology, remarked: “The companies want clarity on vehicles with no pedals and no steering wheel. There could be a fight over this, but if a federal framework is implemented, it could usher in the autonomy economy.” Additionally, if new regulations permit the broader deployment of vehicles without human controls, it could significantly benefit Elon Musk. Musk, who has become an influential figure within the president-elect’s inner circle, has staked the EV maker's future on self-driving technology and artificial intelligence. During his company’s recent quarterly earnings call, Musk expressed his intention to advocate for a streamlined federal approval process for autonomous vehicles, leveraging his position within the Trump administration to advance the regulatory framework for AV adoption. 25 Most In Demand Cars Heading into 2024 In this article, we examined screeners and ETFs to identify leading companies actively engaged in the autonomous vehicle market. We ranked the top 10 stocks in ascending order based on hedge fund sentiment as of Q3 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

While we acknowledge the potential of TSLA, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Title: There are 2 problems with Warren Buffett's stock market valuation indicator
URL: https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/warren-buffett-stock-market-valuation-indicator-tech-gdp-berkshire-hathaway-2024-12
Time Published: 2024-12-09T16:45:11Z

With the stock market trading at record highs, Warren Buffett's favorite valuation indicator is also hitting new peaks. The Buffett Indicator, which measures the total market capitalization of US stocks relative to US GDP, hit an all-time peak of about 209% on Monday, surpassing the record high of 200% reached in August 2021. In other words, the US stock market's total market cap of about $61 trillion, as measured by the Wilshire 5000 index, is more than double the annualized US GDP of about $29 trillion. Bearish investors have been quick to point to the Buffett Indicator as yet another signal that the stock market is significantly overvalued and due for a correction. Yet, research from Morgan Stanley suggests the gauge may not be the best valuation tool to follow. Michael Mauboussin of Morgan Stanley's Counterpoint Globlal highlighted two flaws in the famed Buffett Indicator, which Buffett introduced in a 2001 Forbes article. "The first is that U.S. companies now get more of their sales from outside the U.S. than they did in past decades. GDP does not include those sales. That means the numerator, market capitalization, reflects a larger addressable market than what the denominator, GDP, captures," Mauboussin said. The gauge's failure to capture foreign sales is a big deal, considering that about 40% of revenues derived from S&P 500 companies come from international markets. If those revenues were encapsulated in US GDP, then the Buffett Indicator wouldn't be flashing as big of a warning sign as it is today. The second flaw concerns the idea that the economy today is much different than it was in past eras. "Second, GDP is arguably understated because it fails to measure accurately the quality of goods and services as well as the value of new goods and services. The rise of digitalization makes measurement today more challenging than in the past," Mauboussin said. Whereas the GDP-based stock market valuation indicator may have proven more accurate decades ago, when manufacturing was a bigger part of America's economy, that's not the case today. Research from BlackRock and economist David Rosenberg recently has echoed this thinking. "The equity market's changing sectoral composition reflects the transformation taking hold. So, comparing today's index to that of the past is like comparing apples to oranges," BlackRock said last week. Rosenberg, meanwhile, said last week he has recalibrated his long-standing bearish view due to the evolving nature of America's tech-focused economy. Mauboussin's broad conclusion from his analysis of the Buffett ratio is that valuation measures that worked well in the past might not be suited to the current market. "As with most measures, we need to be careful using it when we compare the present to the past," Mauboussin said. For what it's worth, Buffett himself doesn't think his coined stock market valuation indicator is an all-encompassing tell on whether it's a good time to invest. When asked at Berkshire Hathaway's 2017 shareholder meeting about his thoughts on valuation metrics like the Buffett Indicator, the investor said: "Every number has some degree of meaning," Buffett said. "It means more sometimes than others. … And both of the things that you mentioned get bandied around a lot. It's not that they're unimportant. … They can be very important. Sometimes they can be almost totally unimportant. It's just not quite as simple as having one or two formulas and then saying the market is undervalued or overvalued." Still, as Berkshire Hathaway is sitting on more than $300 billion in cash, investors and market observers have speculated that Buffett is concerned about current stock market valuations.

Title: Amazon should buy Bitcoin, shareholders say
URL: https://qz.com/amazon-shareholders-add-bitcoin-1851716582
Time Published: 2024-12-09T16:42:04Z
Full Content:
Shareholders of Amazon (AMZN-0.48%) have submitted a proposal to add Bitcoin to the balance sheet. The shareholders of the e-commerce giant are urging the company to learn from MicroStrategy (MSTR+3.28%), which heavily invested in Bitcoin, resulting in an increase in its share price. “MicroStrategy – which holds Bitcoin on its balance sheet – has had its stock outperform Amazon stock by 537% in the previous year,” according to a shareholder proposal shared by conservative think tank the National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR). “At minimum, Amazon should evaluate the benefits of holding some, even just 5%, of its assets in Bitcoin,” the proposal added. The proposal comes at a time when shareholders of tech giant Microsoft (MSFT-0.64%) are set to vote on Tuesday on whether to invest in Bitcoin. As of this writing, Bitcoin is currently around $99,000 after surpassing the historic $100,000 milestone. The think tank highlighted several institutional and corporate examples to illustrate why Amazon should consider investing in Bitcoin. It pointed to public companies like Tesla (TSLA+2.79%) and Block (SQ-1.44%), which have already added Bitcoin to their balance sheets. Furthermore, the think tank noted that Amazon’s second and fourth largest institutional shareholders, BlackRock (BLK+1.15%) and Fidelity, have launched Bitcoin ETFs, signaling growing confidence in the cryptocurrency’s potential. Additionally, it suggested that even the U.S. government might establish a Bitcoin strategic reserve as early as 2025, underscoring the increasing mainstream acceptance of Bitcoin as a strategic asset. The think tank emphasized the importance of diversifying Amazon’s holdings, even considering Bitcoin’s volatility. According to the proposal, as of September 30, 2024, Amazon’s total assets amounted to $585 billion, with $88 billion held in cash, cash equivalents, and bonds. “Since cash is consistently being debased and bond yields are lower than the true nation rate, Amazon isn’t adequately protecting billions of dollars of shareholder value simply by holding these assets,” said NCPPR. The think tank argued that Bitcoin outperforms bonds as an investment. As of December 6, 2024, Bitcoin’s price had risen by 131% over the past year, surpassing corporate bonds, which saw an average increase of just 5%, per the proposal. This performance highlights Bitcoin’s potential as a more lucrative alternative to traditional bond investments. Whether or not Amazon decided to add Bitcoin, that’s in the future. However, the way its shareholders have argued in favor of Bitcoin represents how the perception of Bitcoin has changed over the years and how it is getting accepted and becoming more mainstream with each passing day.

Title: Amazon shareholders call for the company to hold 5% of its assets in Bitcoin
URL: https://coinjournal.net/news/amazon-shareholders-call-for-the-company-to-hold-5-of-its-assets-in-bitcoin/
Time Published: 2024-12-09T16:36:35Z
Full Content:
A group of Amazon shareholders has requested that the company allocate 5% of its assets in Bitcoin. The National Center for Public Policy Research, a free-market, independent conservative think tank, submitted the proposal to Amazon for consideration at its 2025 annual shareholder meeting. The proposal, shared by Tim Kotzman, a podcast host covering Bitcoin and MicroStrategy, recommends adding “assets to its treasury that appreciate more than bonds, even if those assets are more volatile short-term.” The proposal points to Bitcoin’s price, which has increased more than 131% over the past year, outperforming corporate bonds by more than 126%, on average. “MicroStrategy – which holds Bitcoin on its balance sheet – has had its stock outperform Amazon stock by 537% in the previous year,” the proposal said. “And they’re not alone. Institutional and corporate Bitcoin adoption is becoming more commonplace: more public companies such as Tesla and Block have added Bitcoin to their balance sheets; Amazon’s second and fourth largest institutional shareholders – BlackRock and Fidelity, respectively – offer their clients a Bitcoin ETF; and the US government may form a Bitcoin strategic reserve in 2025.” The proposal points out that while Bitcoin is a “volatile asset,” Amazon’s stock was the same in the past. Because of this, companies have “a responsibility to maximize shareholder value over the long-term as well as the short-term,” adding: “Diversifying the balance sheet by including some Bitcoin solves this problem without taking on too much volatility. At minimum, Amazon should evaluate the benefits of holding some, even just 5%, of its assets in Bitcoin.” The shareholder proposal comes as Michael Saylor, CEO of MicroStrategy, said to Microsoft that Bitcoin is the best asset a company should own, claiming it represents the “greatest digital transformation of the 21st century.” In a three-minute video posted on X last week, Saylor said: “Microsoft can’t afford to miss the next technology wave, and Bitcoin is the next wave. Bitcoin represents the greatest digital transformation of the 21st century; it represents digital capital.” Talking about long-term capital, Saylor noted that risk – including general taxes, politics, recession, regulation, war, and the weather – is destroying over $10 trillion in capital each year. Because of this, investors are turning their attention to digital capital, such as Bitcoin, to avoid these risks. In Saylor’s view, “it makes sense” for Microsoft to buy and hold Bitcoin rather than buy back stock or hold bonds. “If you’re going to outperform, you’re going to need Bitcoin,” Saylor said. “You’ve surrendered hundreds of billions of dollars of capital over the past five years, and you’ve just amplified the risks that your own shareholders face. If you want to escape that vicious cycle, you’re going to need an asset without counterparty risk.” In Saylor’s opinion, that lies with Bitcoin.

Title: BlackRock’s $12B Purchase Of HPS Wrecks The ‘Easy Money’ Fed Narrative

NEW YORK, NEW YORK - APRIL 26: Scott Kapnick speaks onstage during the Room to Read 2023 New York ... [+] Gala at Gotham Hall on April 26, 2023 in New York City. (Photo by Cindy Ord/Getty Images for Room to Read) There’s no such thing as “easy money” or “costless credit” contra what readers are told with great regularity by economists and their enablers in the commentariat. Evidence supporting this statement of the obvious can most easily be found in the powerful force that is compound interest or returns. Precisely due to the power of both, it’s far too costly for those with title to money to part with it cheaply. Despite these truths, commentators including Ruchir Sharma and Christopher Leonard have endlessly promoted the fiction of easy credit, and economists including the self-regarding Thomas Hoenig have routinely aided them in their promotion of fiction. Thankfully reality always intrudes. The most recent intrusion has reached us care of HPS Investment Partners. Founded in 2007 by former Goldman Sachs partner Scott Kapnick, HPS is in the business of private credit whereby it lends directly to businesses. Crucial about what HPS does for the purposes of this write-up is that per a Wall Street Journal article describing HPS’s $12 billion acquisition by BlackRock, “Its once-obscure business of lending directly to businesses has boomed in recent years while banks have pulled back from making risky loans.” Which requires a pause. Stop and think about when HPS opened its doors (2007), and in thinking about it, contemplate the years in which it grew from something small into a thriving business that rated a $12 billion purchase price. 2007 marked a brief beginning of the end of the Fed’s allegedly “easy money” policies, policies that resumed with great speed in 2008 and beyond. In short, HPS’s business of lending directly at higher rates of interest to businesses less able to attain loans from risk-averse banks soared at precisely the time when the Fed was at or near zero. It all raises an obvious question: what purpose would HPS have served if and when credit was costless, as endlessly asserted by Sharma, Leonard et al? It’s a good question, and it can be answered with the simple truth that the surest sign of tight bank credit is low or “zero” rates of interest care of a Federal Reserve that is invariably following actual banks with its vain rate machinations. When banks are charging exceedingly low rates of interest on loans, that’s the surest sign that they’re only lending to the safest of safe borrowers. Translated, low rates of interest signal tight credit whereby risk averse banks lend to sure things. All of which speaks to the genius of Kapnick and his partners for operating in the real world, and in operating in the real world, seeing well beyond the simplistic economic analysis that takes what the Fed does literally. Please. If the Fed could decree credit “costless” or “cheap” as the conventional in thought tell us over and over again, there would be no credit. Something about price controls leading to scarcity. Instead, we see through HPS’s grand success that actual markets prosperously work around the central planners at the Fed. While a central bank desperately searching for relevance made headlines with toothless rate interventions, companies like HPS were providing actual credit to actual businesses at market rates of interest that reflected actual credit costs that no central bank or government associated with a central bank could ever erase. Which is a positive signal, but also an obvious one. It’s positive in the sense that HPS’s multi-billion dollar acquisition reminds us yet again that credit prices aren’t planned by central planners, and it’s obvious simply because if the Fed could do what economists and commentators think it can, the U.S. economy would be too wrecked to write about in the first place.

New data from blockchain analytics firm Akham reveals that asset management titan BlackRock has gone on an aggressive Bitcoin (BTC) accumulation spree. In a new thread on the social media platform X, Arkham says that BlackRock – which has over $10 trillion in assets under management – bought billions of dollars worth of BTC in less than a week. “BlackRock bought $2.6 billion of Bitcoin this week. That’s more than half a billion every day.” Bitcoin is trading for $99,137 at time of writing, a marginal decrease during the last 24 hours. Arkham also reveals that the asset management giant has been gobbling up the top smart contract platform Ethereum (ETH) at a rapid rate as well. According to Arkham’s data, BlackRock has scooped up $500 million worth of Ethereum last week, raising its balance of Ether by 50% during the last 30 days. Ethereum is trading for $3,935 at time of writing, a 1.33% decline in last 24 hours. Arkham also unveils the BTC holdings of SpaceX and Tesla, two tech companies owned by billionaire Elon Musk. According to the blockchain analytics firm, the Bitcoin stacks held by SpaceX and Tesla are up nearly 3x from their average cost basis. “Elon Musk’s companies’ Bitcoin now worth $2 billion. Tesla: 11,509 BTC ($1.17 billion); SpaceX: 8,285 BTC ($842 million). This Bitcoin was acquired at an average cost basis of $34,980 per BTC, meaning they are up $1.3 billion (186%) on these purchases.” Generated Image: Midjourney Covering the future of finance, including macro, bitcoin, ethereum, crypto, and web 3.

Title: Why RPC, Inc. (RES) Is Among the Best Dividend Paying Debt Free Stocks to Invest in

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 8 Best Dividend Paying Debt Free Stocks to Invest in. In this article, we are going to take a look at where RPC, Inc. (NYSE:RES) stands against the other best debt free stocks that pay dividends. Debt financing is not inherently negative; its impact largely depends on how effectively it is utilized. When managed properly, it can drive substantial cash flow and enhance returns for shareholders. However, poor management of debt can weaken a company’s financial stability. In the second quarter, corporate debt levels decreased despite benchmark interest rates remaining unchanged between April and June. Total debt for both investment-grade and non-investment-grade companies fell to $8.432 trillion, down from $8.517 trillion in the previous quarter. Investment-grade companies reduced their debt by approximately 0.9% to $6.610 trillion, while those rated below BBB- by S&P Global Ratings lowered their debt by about 1.2% to $1.822 trillion, based on data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. READ ALSO: 10 Dividend Knights that Beat The Market Last 3 Years The S&P Global report also highlighted that while total debt among U.S. investment-grade companies declined overall, seven out of 10 nonfinancial sectors experienced debt growth in the second quarter. The energy sector recorded the largest increase, with total debt rising by 4.1% to $502.03 billion. However, this increase was largely offset by a significant 12.7% drop, equivalent to $98.87 billion, in debt within the information technology sector. For non-investment-grade companies, debt decreased across eight of the 10 sectors, with consumer staples experiencing the steepest decline at 7.7%. Conversely, total debt rose only in the healthcare and energy sectors within this category. While many US companies maintain strong balance sheets, a significant share of defaults has come from low-rated firms with negative cash flow, high debt levels, and limited liquidity. These heavily indebted businesses, often referred to as “zombies,” struggle to stay afloat, barely covering their loan interest payments, and are vulnerable to even minor setbacks. An analysis by the Associated Press found that nearly 7,000 publicly traded companies globally, including 2,000 in the U.S., fall into this category. These firms were impacted by years of accumulating inexpensive debt, followed by persistent inflation that pushed borrowing costs to their highest levels in a decade. Additionally, much of the borrowed funds were not directed toward growth initiatives like expansion, hiring, or technological investment but were instead used for stock buybacks. Financial analysts have pointed out that U.S. companies have not taken sufficient steps to reduce their long-term debt, leading to a worsening situation. For the first time, annual interest expenses have exceeded $1 trillion, reaching $1.16 trillion in 2024. According to a Treasury official, the average interest rate on government debt increased to 3.32% in 2024, compared to 2.97% the previous year. The Congressional Budget Office projects that the national debt, currently near 100% of GDP, will climb to 122% by 2034. Using debt to support dividends is typically viewed unfavorably, especially in light of practices observed during the 2020 pandemic. At that time, many private companies turned to dividend recapitalization, borrowing funds to maintain dividend payouts. The trend persisted in 2024 as well. As of September 30, 2024, US companies, including those not supported by private equity, have secured a record $70.2 billion in leveraged loans for dividend recapitalizations, based on data from PitchBook. This amount surpasses the $67.2 billion recorded in 2021, the previous high point for such activity. That said, many companies have maintained stable balance sheets, with US firms consistently setting new records for dividend payments year after year. A pressure pumping machine at the centre of an oilfield, surrounded by a team of workers in the field. To create this list, we first used a screener and identified companies with minimal or no debt. From this pool, we selected those that consistently pay dividends to shareholders and compared their enterprise value (EV) to their market capitalization to gauge which ones are debt-free. We then narrowed down the list by including stocks that had sustainable dividend yields. From that list, we picked 8 companies with the highest number of hedge funds having stakes in them, as per Insider Monkey's database of Q3 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 14 Market Cap as of December 7: $1.26 billion Enterprise Value as of December 7: $1.01 billion RPC, Inc. (NYSE:RES) is a Georgia-based oil and gas services company. During the third quarter, the company experienced a decline in revenues and profits due to a challenging oilfield services market. Both oil prices and rig counts decreased sequentially, creating additional difficulties in an already competitive landscape. Non-pressure pumping service lines proved more stable, with a modest 4% aggregate revenue decline, while pressure pumping revenues dropped by a low double-digit percentage. The stock is also down by over 18% since the start of the year. However, broader service lines and larger, more diversified customers remained relatively stable. RPC, Inc. (NYSE:RES)'s Tier 4 dual fuel assets continued to see high utilization with strong visibility, whereas demand for older equipment was weaker. Management plans to implement targeted cost-saving measures to protect margins until industry conditions improve. In addition to this, RPC, Inc. (NYSE:RES) remained debt free at the end of the quarter and returned $8.6 million to shareholders through dividends. The company ended the quarter with $277 million available in cash. In the first nine months of the year, it generated $255.2 million in operating cash flow and its free cash flow for the period came in at $75.8 million. On October 24, the company declared a quarterly dividend of $0.24 per share, which was in line with its previous dividend. The stock's dividend yield on December 7 came in at 2.74%. The number of hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey owning stakes in RPC, Inc. (NYSE:RES) grew to 14 in Q3 2024, from 11 in the previous quarter. These stakes have a consolidated value of over $60.4 million. With nearly 3 million shares, GAMCO Investors owned the largest stake in the company. Overall, RES ranks 6th on our list of the best debt free stocks that pay dividends. While we acknowledge the potential for RES to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than RES but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Spot Bitcoin ETFs Attract $9.9 Billion in Inflows After Trump’s Election Victory

Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have seen nearly $10 billion inflows since Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump won the US elections, as investors flocked into the cryptocurrency sector since the results were revealed. The 12 spot Bitcoin ETFs from various major asset managers, including BlackRock and Fidelity Investments, attracted $9.9 billion in net inflows following Election Day on November 5, according to Bloomberg, lifting their assets to around $113 billion. According to data from SoSoValue, spot Bitcoin ETFs currently have $112.7 billion in total net assets, equivalent to around 5.62% of the flagship cryptocurrency’s total market capitalization. These inflows came amid a wider cryptocurrency market rally, which saw the price of Bitcoin briefly top the $100,000 mark before correcting to now trade at $98,000. Over the last 30 days, the price of the flagship cryptocurrency is nevertheless up by more than 28.5%. The total market capitalization of the cryptocurrency space, over the same period, rose by around $1 trillion. Trump notably picked David Sacks, a former PayPal chief operating officer, as the White House’s new AI and Cryptocurrency czar. Sacks, according to Trump, is set to “guide policy for the Administration in Artificial Intelligence and Cryptocurrency, two areas critical to the future of American competitiveness.” Bitcoin’s price rise saw various investors step up their accumulation efforts with Nasdaq-listed business intelligence firm MicroStrategy, the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, earlier this month adding an additional 15,400 coins for $1.5 billion, at an average price of $95.976 per coin. The move saw MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin holdings top the 400,000 mark for the first time, with the company achieving a BTC Yield of 38.7% so far this year, and 63.3% year-to-date. It now holds 402,100 BTC that were acquired for $23.4 billion. The move comes at a time in which Bitcoin whales have been taking advantage of the flagship cryptocurrency’s recent price dip to keep on accumulating BTC after short-term holders moved nearly $4 billion in the cryptocurrency to exchanges. According to CryptoQuant analyst Cauê Oliveira, Bitcoin whales took advantage of the “panic selling” to accumulate, with 16,000 BTC worth nearly $1.5 billion entered whale reserves in a single day after short-term holders’ sales. In a post, the analyst noted that the figure was “reflected in institutional addresses on the network” but suggested more BTC was accumulated, as the funds that weren’t withdrawn from cryptocurrency exchanges and remain in users’ accounts aren’t counted. Per his words, the whale accumulation hasn’t been sufficient to demonstrate a “more widespread buy-the-dip” pattern,” which he said remains concentrated among institutional investors.

Title: Crypto ETFs Note Record Inflows as BTC and ETH’s Prices Surge
URL: https://www.cryptocynews.com/crypto-etfs-note-record-inflows-as-btc-and-eths-prices-surge/
Time Published: 2024-12-09T13:54:27Z

Cryptocurrrency News The broader digital asset market had a historic week, with rising investor interest in Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs). With positive regulatory developments and increasing market confidence, crypto ETFs recorded new milestones that signified the continuation of a bullish market momentum before the year ends. US spot Bitcoin ETFs saw a massive turnaround over the past week as they noted inflows of $2.73 billion. The week started cautiously, with the market experiencing outflows of $435.5 million and $122.8 million on December 2 and 3, which observers believe were influenced by the national holiday. However, the flow momentum changed during the midweek as the sector saw significant daily inflows of $353.6 million, $676 million, $788.7 million, and $376.6 million on Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, respectively. BlackRock’s IBIT accounted for over $2.6 billion of the funds flow. This achievement reflects BlackRock’s dominance in the ETF space. In addition, these robust inflows coincided with Bitcoin’s price rise above $100,000 for the first time. BTC’s ascent to its all-time high signifies a psychological victory for the crypto industry, reinforcing the token’s reputation as a hedge against inflation. Like their Bitcoin counterparts, Ether ETFs also saw a notable increase in inflows. The US spot Ether ETFs saw net inflows of about $2 billion this past week. The favorable regulatory climate in the US and the incoming administration’s pro-crypto position contribute to Ether ETFs’ rising appeal. It has encouraged investors to diversify their investment portfolios beyond BTC and contributed to Ether’s strong performance. Many institutional investors prefer Ethereum because, in contrast to Bitcoin, it provides use cases through its smart contract features. Even though the United States still leads the crypto ETF narrative, other nations are making significant strides. One of those nations is Argentina, which has incorporated cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds into its financial markets with President Javier Milei’s approval. The issuance of ETF CEDEARs (Argentine deposit certificates), which give local investors access to overseas crypto-linked assets, was recently approved by the CNV, the country’s securities regulator. Although ETF CEDEARs have been legal for six years, this is the first time they have been issued, making it a significant development for Argentina. This product offers various investment options, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, gold, and the Chinese stock market index. Argentina hopes to use these tools to increase international investment and boost its financial sector. It is worth noting that the South American nation has previously acknowledged the legitimacy of smart contracts and welcomed cryptocurrency-backed funding for businesses. These crypto funds establish the country as a pioneer in digital asset adoption in the region. The global financial landscape is rapidly changing due to the explosive rise of crypto ETFs, which link traditional and digital finance. With inflows from leading players like BlackRock and Fidelity Investments, the total assets under management for Bitcoin ETFs in the US have increased to almost $113 billion. This inflow spike results from increased trust in cryptocurrencies as an asset class. Another notable contributor is Donald Trump’s election win and supportive stance on digital assets. The incoming administration’s supportive legislation will lay the groundwork for a wider acceptance of cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds. Steps like appointing a pro-crypto chair of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and establishing a unique White House position for digital assets demonstrate a strong commitment to promoting innovation in the industry. Nevertheless, ongoing regulatory clarity, technological advancement, and investor education will be critical to the success of crypto ETFs. For instance, market confidence alone won’t be enough to sustain a push for Bitcoin above $100,000. Other external factors like macroeconomic stability and greater institutional engagement are also necessary. Meanwhile, regions such as Argentina and El Salvador demonstrate how cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds can help cushion economic instability. Countries can open new investment opportunities and attract foreign capital by establishing crypto ETFs like ETF CEDEARs. Your email address will not be published.

The challenge grant of $30,000 from Daniel Shuchman has now been met and we are happy to announce a new challenge grant of $25,000 from Kerry and Helen Welsh. That means every dollar you donate turns into two until this new challenge grant is reached! This past year has been absolutely crazy, with the weirdest presidential race in U.S. history, including the incumbent dropping out via X (come on, man!), assassination attempts, and one of the most spectacular political comebacks ever. And next year will almost certainly be an even wilder ride, as Donald Trump promises to whittle down the reach of the government even as he pushes tariffs and mass deportation. But maybe the biggest story of 2024—and 2025, too—is something that runs roughshod over and around government: bitcoin, which recently cracked the $100,000 mark and gained a whole new aura of respectability. Reason has been covering this digital gold since its inception and our coverage exemplifies our principled, libertarian approach to journalism. Earlier this year, major investment firms like BlackRock and Fidelity started hawking their own bitcoin ETFs and politicians such as Republican Sen. Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming (a Reason Interview subject) gained new traction calling for a strategic bitcoin reserve. Reason has been lauding bitcoin's challenge to "state-controlled money" from the beginning: Through the Soho Forum, we sponsored a debate in 2018 between bitcoin bear Peter Schiff and bitcoin bull Erik Voorhees that has pulled over 1 million views and remains a great introduction to why this alternative asset is going to be around for the long haul (and why it threatens the establishment): Over the years, we've talked with major figures in the bitcoin world like Michael Saylor, whose company MicroStrategy owns the single-biggest known cache of bitcoin, Broken Money author Lyn Alden, and Balaji Srinivasan, the super-investor whose bold prediction of bitcoin going to a million dollars didn't come true (yet). We explored how the dark web site Silk Road demonstrated a controversial use case for bitcoin and have covered and participated in the annual Bitcoin Conference since its inception. When FTX, the shady crypto exchange run by Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), hit the skids, we talked with Kraken founder Jesse Powell about the need for investor due diligence and how SBF tried to rig regulations in his company's favor. We debunked the phony argument that bitcoin was a disaster for the environment in articles and videos by Alex Gladstein of the Human Rights Foundation, and we showcased how bitcoin provides hope and money for people in authoritarian countries. Jim Epstein's Cypherpunks Write Code video series explored the prehistory of cryptocurrency and Brian Doherty went "In Search of the Elusive Bitcoin Billionaire" in 2018. Senegalese app developer Fodé Diop explained how bitcoin-enabled smartphones might help developing nations break free of what he calls "monetary colonialism": Just last week, Zach Weissmueller and Liz Wolfe talked with crypto podcaster and investor Nic Carter about how Trump's embrace of digital assets affected the 2024 election. Last time around, Trump was antagonistic toward bitcoin and crypto; this time he's all in (in fact, I had a memorable encounter with him at Pubkey, a bitcoin-themed bar in Greenwich Village this fall). Better yet, he's named innovation-friendly Paul Atkins to head up his Securities and Exchange Commission, a giant improvement over outgoing chairman Gary Gensler, who did all he could to throttle crypto. Our coverage of bitcoin—like our coverage of everything—isn't uncritical boosterism, of course. Just a few weeks ago, staffer Katarina Hall reported on her unsuccessful attempts to use bitcoin in El Salvador, the first country to adopt it alongside the U.S. dollar as legal tender. And our resident song parodist Remy not only mocked Dogecoin, he had fun at the expense of tech bros with "Bitcoin Billionaire," a rap that has generated over 1.6 million views: All of this is to say: If you find bitcoin and cryptocurrencies interesting—and if you've made some gains from them in this rally—think about supporting Reason. Since 1968, we've been talking about ways to make the world better, freer, and more fair, all without necessarily dragging government or politics into the matter. Bitcoin is the latest, and possibly greatest, development on that front in a very long time.

The murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson has cast a spotlight on the extensive security measures employed by Wall Street's elite to ensure their safety. With the increasing risks associated with high-profile roles, companies are shelling out significant amounts to protect their top executives. Big tech firms like Google, Amazon, and Tesla are among the many that prioritise personal security for their CEOs. These measures often include personal security details, private transportation, and state-of-the-art security systems, adding millions to operational costs annually. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella A prime example is Microsoft's CEO, Satya Nadella. Microsoft ramped up security for its CEO, allocating over $58,000 for his travel security this year. This figure was disclosed in the company's SEC filing on October 24. Mr Nadella, set to earn $79.1 million this year, had previously requested a pay reduction to offset rising security expenses after multiple incidents earlier in the year, CNBC first reported. Tesla CEO Elon Musk In the first two months of 2024, Tesla spent $500,000 on Elon Musk's security, more than five times what was spent in the same period in 2019. This follows a significant increase in security costs, with Tesla disclosing $2.4 million spent on Mr Musk's protection in 2023. Between 2015 and 2018, Mr Musk's monthly security expenses averaged $145,000. His protection is managed by high-profile firms, including Gavin de Becker & Associates and his own Foundation Security. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink World's largest asset manager, BlackRock, doubled its security spending for CEO Larry Fink in 2023, as per security filings. The company spent $216,837 on personal security guards and $563,513 on upgrading Mr Fink's home security system. Google CEO Sundar Pichai Last year, Alphabet spent over $6.7 million on CEO Sundar Pichai for expenses, including security, retirement contributions, company vehicles, and other benefits, as per a Securities and Exchange Commission filing. These expenditures formed the bulk of his total compensation package, exceeding $6.8 million. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy In 2023, Andy Jassy's transportation costs totalled $986,164, covering business travel and security upgrades, as per a Quartz report. His compensation dropped compared to 2022, largely due to a decline in Amazon's stock price and fewer restricted stock units. The stock price fell from $156.51 in 2022 to $143.90 in 2023, as per filings. Track Latest News Live on NDTV.com and get news updates from India and around the world

Title: Private Credit’s Struggling Pioneer Is a Warning Sign for Market

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. (Bloomberg) -- It was little more than two and a half years ago that Franklin Templeton’s boss Jenny Johnson took to LinkedIn to express her excitement about buying European private credit stalwart Alcentra. Today, a key part of the acquired business is struggling to justify the enthusiasm. Most Read from Bloomberg A Chicago Skyscraper Cements the Legacy of a Visionary Postmodern Architect NYC’s Run-Down Bus Terminal Gets Approval for $10 Billion Revamp Kansas City Looks Back on its Long, Costly Ride With Microtransit In its heyday, Alcentra was up there with current direct-lending success stories such as Ares Management Corp. and Intermediate Capital Group Plc. as they jousted for preeminence in making loans to Europe’s companies. But unlike old rivals that are expanding their assets at breakneck speed, Alcentra has shrunk. At its peak it managed about $43 billion of assets, according to Fitch Ratings. By the time Franklin struck the deal to acquire the London-based lender, it had $38 billion. It now has about $32 billion. Alcentra’s corporate direct-lending franchise, the engine room of most private credit businesses, has halved from €12 billion ($12.7 billion) in 2020 to €6 billion, according to an analysis by Bloomberg News of the firm’s public filings. With other asset-management giants such as BlackRock Inc. and State Street Corp. shopping around for their own purchases in the booming $1.6 trillion private credit market, Alcentra is a cautionary tale from the industry. Franklin’s purchase of Alcentra in 2022 is dwarfed by BlackRock’s acquisition of HPS Investment Partners — and the low sale price reflects problems that predate the sale — but its ongoing troubles with its once-flagship fund are a reminder that fortunes can change fast in this industry. Back in 2019 Alcentra raised one of Europe’s then largest direct-lending funds. Botched leadership changes, a staff exodus and some poor investments have weighed heavily. Five years on it’s still trying to raise a follow-on fund. An Alcentra spokesperson says the firm’s overall assets under management have been “stable” since Franklin’s takeover was completed in November 2022, and that it has seen “strong momentum and performance” in other parts of the business: “Over the last 12 months, we’ve seen successful fund closes and significant fundraising traction in our structured credit and special situations vintages, as well as inflows into our European liquid credit strategies.” Nevertheless, the travails of its direct-lending fund carry a warning for the private credit asset class more broadly. Funds that can’t keep up with returns offered by peers, or who lose staff, are finding it hard to bring in new money as unforgiving investors increasingly put their faith in the promised stability of private capital’s biggest beasts. “More firms have issues now that were previously not apparent,” says Andrew Bellis, head of private debt at Partners Group, speaking generally about the market rather than Alcentra. “There will be a shakeout in the industry, but that happens over a long period of time. We might look back and say, ‘What happened to that firm that used to be big?’” First-Mover Advantage Alcentra was an early mover into European direct lending along with fellow pioneers Ares, ICG and Arcmont Asset Management. But even as this industry has flourished — as private firms muscle in on the lucrative corporate loan business once dominated by Wall Street — the trailblazer has floundered. While rivals have been targeting fundraisings comfortably over €10 billion and expanding their direct-lending arms, Alcentra is the odd one out. Its latest fund for this market was registered in Luxembourg more than four years ago and, so far, there’s been no public statement about it reaching any milestones. Franklin’s acquisition was part of a major expansion in alternative assets by the $1.6 trillion investment giant after buying Lexington Partners, a private equity fund manager. Franklin and its ilk have been drawn to private markets by the allure of higher returns and as a way to win back clients who’ve shunned more traditional actively-managed stock and bond funds. Franklin has been one of the asset managers most affected by outflows in recent years, with clients pulling about $176 billion from its funds since 2019, according to Morningstar Inc. It’s also dealing with the fallout of another, more traditional acquisition. Ken Leech, the former star trader of Western Asset Management Co., which Franklin bought through its acquisition of Legg Mason, has been charged by the US for alleged fraud. “Franklin Templeton manages $250 billion in alternative assets, and the Alcentra business is an important part of our offering in the alternative credit space,” a spokesperson for the company says. Part of the problem for Alcentra’s direct-lending arm has been performance. The fund manager has been involved in several debt-for-equity swaps since 2019, according to Bloomberg research, a sign that things weren’t going well for these companies. These include Lifetime Training, an apprenticeship training provider that struggled to recover from the Covid-19 pandemic, and Caroola (previously known as Optionis), a professional services provider that was crippled by a cyber hack in 2022, according to public filings. One Alcentra investor, Strathclyde Pension Fund, said at a recent meeting that the lender provided a 6.7% return over the last year, according to documents seen by Bloomberg, while two other private-debt investments, Barings and Partners Group, delivered 10.9% and 11.1%. Since the start of Strathclyde's investment, however, Alcentra does stack up well against its peers. Strathclyde was candid about where some of the more recent issues arose: “Alcentra has suffered from a high level of senior turnover and has had a change of ownership.” The pension fund has decided to run off its investment, according to the documents, meaning it won’t put any more money in. “The one thing you want to see is consistency in deal performance and the team,” says Vasileios Kocheilas, a seasoned investor in private credit funds. “Investing is about finding the right people to do the right things.” As smaller private credit firms find it tougher to deliver that consistency, and to get new fundraising off the ground, private-capital behemoths such as Blackstone Inc. and Ares are taking the lion’s share of the market’s growth. Investors, known as limited partners, are voting with their feet. “LPs have to make tough decisions on which managers to back,” says Mike Dennis, partner and co-head of European credit at Ares, speaking generally about the market. “We’re seeing LPs consolidate their manager relationships because of liquidity constraints. And for some of those small managers, it’s very difficult to say what their differentiation is.” Size isn’t everything, however. Some of the old titans of traditional money management haven’t cracked this red-hot asset class. Fidelity International halted its early European direct-lending activities this year. BlackRock will hope that buying a premium outfit like HPS will spare any pain, even if it isn’t cheap. At the less exalted end of the private credit market, some are bracing for the emergence of zombie funds, so-called because they own a bunch of illiquid assets and are struggling to raise cash to buy more. Instead, they begin a slow process of withering away. It’s a familiar sight in private equity, where hundreds of firms are in that unhappy position. In private credit, the assets are loans with fixed maturities — so, unlike equity, a fund can’t stumble on forever. But a firm’s future is predicated on its ability to raise more capital and keep scaling. As this nascent asset class matures, subpar performance may lead to a sticky end. “We’re going to see more zombie funds as credit managers will have had so many problematic deals that no one will be willing to give them any more money,” Kocheilas concludes. --With assistance from Loukia Gyftopoulou.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. A group of Amazon (AMZN, Financial) shareholders, led by the National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR), has recommended that Amazon invest at least 5% in bitcoins. The measure interceptor for review ahead of the 2025 AGM will seek to fix the issue caused by Amazon entering the cryptocurrency market, given that Bitcoin has outperformed most assets, including corporate bonds. Interestingly, MicroStrategy (MSTR, Financial), the company that has chosen to integrate Bitcoin as part of its treasury management, had a significantly better score of 537% when compared to Amazon's stock price in the last year. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with AMZN. This proposal has also highlighted the increasing institutional adoption of bitcoins; different stakeholders, such as Amazon's shareholders, BlackRock, and Fidelity, offer bitcoin ETFs to their clients. This is well in tune with the trend of big firms like Tesla and Block incorporating cryptocurrencies in their working capital. The NCPPR thinks that Bitcoin may create inflation protection and increase steadiness in shareholder value with time. Amazon has yet to make a public response to the proposal; however, its board will have to analyze and decide whether or not to propose the change in the proxy statement for the 2025 meeting. The NCPPR's push comes after an attempt to get Microsoft(MSFT, Financial) to include the digital currency on its balance sheet, which was rejected by the shareholders.

Title: A Bitcoin Miner Promised To Help A Texas Town. It Went Bankrupt Instead. Now, It’s Pivoting To AI

Three years ago, one of the world’s largest bitcoin miners offered a lifeline to the town of Denton, Texas, a community burdened with tens of millions of dollars in debt. The miner, Core Scientific, wanted to build a data center in the city. In exchange for a massive power contract that would double Denton’s energy footprint, the company would provide much needed revenue in the form of taxes and fees. Denton accepted. But within months of powering on, Core Scientific filed for bankruptcy after being saddled with its own outstanding debt. Now, on the heels of the artificial intelligence boom, Core Scientific has reinvented itself as a cloud computing company for AI startups. Last month, the former crypto miner announced that its Denton facility will transform into what it claims will be one of the largest AI supercomputers in North America. It received a green light from Denton’s local government to increase its previously 297-megawatt (MW) power agreement by another 100 MWs, enough to run nearly 400,000 homes — a capacity larger than Elon Musk’s “Colossus” supercomputer in Memphis, Tennessee. Many industrial bitcoin miners have pivoted their operations to AI in hopes of boosting revenue streams after the volatile 2022 market downturn known as “crypto winter.” Companies like Core Scientific, Hut 8, Bitdeer and Terawulf have all retrofitted data centers to accommodate racks of high-end chips needed to train AI models. In June, Core Scientific announced a $3.5 billion contract with AI hyperscaler CoreWeave to provide the data center space needed to host a massive array of Nvidia H100 GPUs, for which it has allocated 200 MWs worth of power. News of the partnership sparked a $4 billion increase in the market cap of 14 bitcoin miners with similar computing resources, according to JP Morgan. In Denton, Core Scientific spent nearly three years developing datacenters to mine crypto before deciding to make the switch. The transition is a relatively simple one — Core Scientific has retired its mining machines, and will be updating existing buildings to support rows of GPU servers. The Austin-based company was founded in 2017 by Aber Whitcomb, who previously cofounded Myspace, along with Darin Feinstein and CEO Mike Levitt. Over the following years, it opened a number of facilities across the southern U.S. In 2023, after filing for bankruptcy, it received a $500 million loan from creditors including BlackRock and Apollo Global Manager. Last month, the miner reported $95 million in third quarter revenue and $415 million in revenue for the year. It currently operates nine data centers in Alabama, Georgia, Kentucky, North Carolina, North Dakota and Texas. Core Scientific did not initially disclose its identity to the public, and one city council member who voted against the proposal called it a “deal with the devil” Core Scientific was drawn to Denton because of its abundance of electricity and cheap real estate. At the time, the city’s local power utility, Denton Municipal Electric (DME), had recently incurred $210 million in electricity fees during a historic winter storm in 2021 that caused energy costs to skyrocket. When Core Scientific proposed building its data center in town — a project that would supposedly deliver the utility up to $8 million a year in revenue — DME was $140 million in debt. But residents and some Denton city officials were skeptical of the project because of its secretive nature and large energy footprint. Core Scientific did not initially disclose its identity to the public, and one city council member who voted against the proposal called it a “deal with the devil,” BuzzFeed News previously reported. Another council member said, “We don’t need to allow an unidentified company to use our city’s infrastructure to increase greenhouse gas emissions for the sole purpose of turning a profit.” But they ultimately supported the project after DME convinced them that Core Scientific would shoulder 100% of the risk. Got a story tip? Contact Sarah Emerson on Signal at 510-473-8820 or email semerson@forbes.com. Denton’s partnership with Core Scientific was announced in October 2021 and its facility became operational four months later. In December 2022, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy after experiencing $434 million in losses the preceding quarter, citing liquidity issues caused by a number of factors including energy costs and bitcoin prices that fell by 60% that year. It opted not to liquidate and continue mining crypto, but halted the completion of its Denton facility, which left two large buildings unfinished. In January of this year, Core Scientific restructured $400 million in debt and received court approval to exit bankruptcy. A few months later, it had signed an AI computing contract with CoreWeave. CoreWeave has ridden the AI wave to a $1.5 billion valuation and reported $250 million in revenue last year. As one of the primary distributors of Nvidia chips, it’s found a niche renting on-demand compute space to AI startups. Last year, it struck a deal with Microsoft to provide potentially billions of dollars worth of GPUs to support Microsoft’s partnership with OpenAI. Core Scientific’s bankruptcy meant that Denton “received less than originally anticipated” because the project was never fully built out, Stuart Birdseye, spokesperson for Denton’s power utility DME, told Forbes. DME earned $2.3 million in revenue from the data center last year, according to the North Texas Daily, though Birdseye told Forbes that income from Core Scientific “was a net positive for the city in total.” Now, it stands to bring in much more. In addition to an increased power capacity, Core Scientific will lease more than 40 new acres of land near its facility for an AI computing campus. The company’s proposed $6.1 billion property investment is expected to result in $194 million in property tax revenue for the city over the first 10 years after the build-out is complete some time in 2027, the city said. Neither DME nor Core Scientific elaborated on how that money will be distributed over time. City manager Sara Hensley said in a statement that the site will “serve as a model for high-performing computing innovation” as Denton courts other high-tech investments. AI data centers, which typically run continuously, have yet to show the same willingness to halt processing voluntarily if local electricity demands surge In a recent announcement, Denton’s government also claimed the project will create “an estimated 300 full-time, on-site positions, and over 200 independent jobs from entities that would support the operation.” A Core Scientific spokesperson told Forbes that “actual hiring plans have not been finalized but we believe most of the jobs created will be filled locally.” Similar to the development of its crypto mining operation, Core Scientific will assume the cost of updating transmission infrastructure, such as two new substations that will be needed to accommodate its larger power load. The company would only disclose CoreWeave as a customer for the Denton site; the startup counts among its customers Microsoft and Nvidia. Unlike Core Scientific’s mining center, however, its supercomputer will not be immediately participating in a program known as “demand response” that requires large power customers to limit their operations when energy demands are spiking. Many of the bitcoin giants that flocked to Texas during the crypto boom touted their ability to shut down at a moment’s notice, since it was easy to halt mining as needed. Some even profited from an arrangement with ERCOT, the state’s power grid operator, which allowed them to sell back pre-purchased electricity on the energy marketplace. Last year, the miner Riot Platforms reportedly earned $31 million from ERCOT this way. AI data centers, which typically run continuously, have yet to show the same willingness to halt processing voluntarily if local electricity demands surge, such as during a storm. Previously, Core Scientific was also enrolled in ERCOT’s demand response program, but told Forbes it will “reassess our ability to participate” after the computing equipment is installed. Birdseye said DME still has the ability to interrupt the facility’s power supply when the grid is stressed, but did not elaborate on how those instances will be handled with Core Scientific. In Memphis, where Elon Musk has said his xAI supercomputer will host 1 million GPUs, the state’s power utility has required the company to enroll in its own demand response program. Moving forward, the city insists that Core Scientific’s expansion will not derail its environmental goals. Since 2020, Denton has offset 100% of its energy footprint mostly through local renewable energy contracts, and claims to be the first Texas city to do so. BuzzFeed News had reported that Core Scientific’s crypto mine involved the buying of “renewable energy credits” or RECs, which are a controversial accounting mechanism allowing companies to offset their emissions on paper. “This will continue to be the case as the city’s energy needs increase, which includes this development,” said Birdseye, who added that staff are “currently analyzing these future needs and is developing a strategy to continue with this process.”

The world's most viewed site on global warming and climate change Quote of the Week: ““It can scarcely be denied that the supreme goal of all theory is to make the irreducible basic elements as simple and as few as possible without having to surrender the adequate representation of a single datum of experience.” – Albert Einstein (1933) Number of the Week: Over 7 days THIS WEEK: By Ken Haapala, President, Science and Environmental Policy Project (SEPP) Scope: Discussed in This Week is the failure of wind and solar plus a battery to deliver power needed for a small, isolated community, population 20,000, in Australia. Also discussed is the need to separate two distinct properties of water vapor when considering the greenhouse effect. An extensive list of general failures of climate models is presented. An interpretation of the failure of the recent UN COP meeting is given. Suggestions for improving US weather prediction are made. A disturbing interview, if facts are verified, is presented. ****************** The Potemkin Village: For a decade, engineers such as the late Roger Andrews have discussed the tremendous electricity storage requirements needed to supply electricity when wind and solar fail. Thus far the largest storage facilities have been pumped hydro-storage first developed in Switzerland over 100 years ago. Such facilities must be replenished on a timely basis, otherwise they fail. Timely replenishment requires reliable power, such as from hydrocarbons or nuclear. Two experiments to run exclusively on wind and solar power have failed. One was on El Hierro (population about 13,000) in the Canary Islands and the second on King Island (population about 1,500) off Tasmania – hardly complex modern cities with huge energy needs. Commentators such as Francis Menton have called for a demonstration project showing that a modern city or community can thrive on wind and solar plus storage. In an essay on Climate, Etc. utility planning engineer Russell Schussler discusses a third experiment. He writes: “In October of 2024, the isolated small city of Broken Hill in New South Wales, Australia with a 36 MW load (including the large nearby mines) could not be reliably served by 200 MW of wind, a 53 MW solar array, significant residential solar, and a large 50 MW battery all supplemented by diesel generators. Many people falsely believe that wind, solar and batteries have been demonstrated to provide grid support and deliver energy independently in large real word applications. Few people realize that we are a long way away from having wind, solar and batteries support a large power system without significant amounts of conventional spinning generation (nuclear, gas, coal, hydro, geothermal) on-line to support the grid. Broken Hill Outage – Wind, Solar and Battery Can Not Support the Grid The recent outages occurring in Broken Hill help illustrate the inability of wind, solar and batteries to support electric grids without significant help from machines rotating in synchronism with the grid. (Note – wind power is produced by rotation but not in synchronism with the grid). Around 20,000 people live in the Broken Hill area. Over $650 million in investment made Broken Hill home to a 200 MW wind plant, a 53 MW solar array, and a large battery that could provide 50 MW of power for 100 MWh through advanced grid forming inverters. Broken Hill is home to over 6,000 small-scale solar systems providing a per capita energy small solar production level almost twice the Australian average. The area also contains two poorly maintained diesel-powered gas turbine generators in the area, one which was off-line for maintenance. Broken Hill became renewable energy industry’s Potemkin Village: In 2018, Broken Hill City Council announced its goal to become Australia’s first carbon-free city by 2030. Three years ago, then mayor Darriea Turley welcomed the announcement that AGL was proceeding with plans to build a grid-scale battery, which the company claimed would be a reliable backup power source for 10,000 homes. “This is a great opportunity for Broken Hill and renewable energies,” Turley told the ABC. “What they will see is when there is an outage, the battery would click into operation.” In October of 2024, this area was separated from the larger grid when the interconnecting transmission towers went down in a bad storm. Loads in Broken Hill are limited to about 20 MW of mining load and 17 MW that serve the local town for a combined load of 36 MW. The over 300 MWs of renewable energy from wind, solar and battery storage, along with a diesel generator were not able to provide reliable power to support the town alone.” Schussler gives a graph of the nameplate capacity of the resources and the loads then states: “A 25 MW gas plant or a 25 MW hydro plant would have done a much better job than the combined efforts of 200 MW of wind, 53 MW of solar, the 34 MW of distributed solar and 50 MW battery. The consequences for Broken Hill were serious. The Australian ran an article entitled: Broken Hill: Powerless and left to live like mushrooms where it described the situation: ‘The power comes on from time to time but goes out just as quickly. It gives us just enough time to power our phones and read emails from energy providers sent the day before, alerting us to the fact the power was about to go out. They also warn we don’t have much time, and to avoid using unnecessary electrical devices – air conditioners, fridges or fans that need a power point.’ In theory the area could be served, but in reality, as noted by Jo Nova, ‘The fridges in the pharmacies failed, so all medications had to be destroyed, and emergency replacements sent in. Schools have been closed. Freezers of meat are long gone… Emergency trucks are bringing in food finally.’” Schussler discusses the big differences between theory and practice which often occur. In theory, the battery at Broken Hill should have worked, but it didn’t. Failure to recognize this difference leads to fuzzy thinking about Microgrids. Microgrids with batteries require the same battery capacity as needed to meet the longest period in which there is little or no electrical generation. These periods of time are grossly underestimated by wind and solar promoters and their political collaborators. [For a current example, Cliff Mass reports that a formidable pool of cold, dense cloud-laden air has settled within the Columbia River Basin, resulting in virtually no power generation from all the wind turbines for a whole week. Wind power is often over 2,000 megawatts, and accounts for over 10% of the generation capacity of the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) Balancing Authority Area. Of course, BPA relies on the largest hydro-generation system in the US, which some local politicians such as the governor of Washington State are trying to shut down.] Schussler concludes his revealing essay with: “Australia has been much hyped recently as a pioneer in renewables, but the cracks are showing. There are many other stories of emerging problems that could be shared. Germany was the leader before. All that hype has crumbled, showing the Energiewende as a pipe dream with a poison pill. There is a simple point that is being widely ignored: wind, solar and batteries do not support the grid much. There are many tricks employed to help proponents and policy makers overlook this simple fact but eventually reality will hammer the point home. Many excuses for this outage will likely emerge. I’ve heard that changing the battery setting made it more effective than it was initially. Undoubtedly inverter-based technology will continue to improve and wind and solar with the proper settings and equipment will be able to contribute better. While inverter-based generation with computer control may one day provide a lot of options, such technology will also provide tremendous complexity and challenges as well. Who will know how to make so many elements with unlimited potential operating characteristics behave well together across a multitude of potential unknown and unpredictable situations? Experience with the grid has come from many decades of study and practice. As the penetration of inverter-based resources increases I suspect every outage study after the fact will continue to find that the inverter setting could have been better. Many can argue that the grid at Broken Hill could or should have worked better (although the failure was likely beyond their worst fears). That’s typically true for any grid during any outage. To quote Nick Cater again., “If wind, solar and storage can’t keep the beer cold in a small city like Broken Hill, how will it perform when called upon to power the rest of the country?” Policy makers pushing for standalone power systems built primarily on wind, solar and batteries are lurching towards disaster and will only avoid calamity to the extent that they are unsuccessful in their goals of removing conventional rotating machinery or are able to lean on the despised conventional technology of their interconnected neighbors.” In addition, Paul Homewood discusses that for wind power, batteries are needed to balance wind power frequency for the grid. This should not be confused with electricity storage for the grid. In National Grid & The Hornsea Battery, he writes: “The storage will be 600 MWh and is not designed to ‘be used when needed.’ Hornsea 3 will have a capacity of 2.9 GW, so 600 MWh would only be enough to last 12 minutes when the wind stops blowing. Its real role is to balance grid frequency, as wind output can fluctuate even on a minute-to-minute basis.” One problem seldom mentioned by commentators pertains to re-powering the grid which for some reason has gone down. Imagine a small grid drawing (say) 100 MW normally supplied by a combination of solar, wind, and batteries, that suddenly goes down. Residents, businesses, hospitals, and small factories have lights, motors, refrigerators, computers, and instruments of all kinds turned on and waiting for power. Re-powering that location requires the sudden change from zero power to 100 MW, with all generators synchronized to within a few milliseconds. What can easily be accomplished by a single 100-MW generator becomes an impossible dream with the distributed power sources.

Kininmonth was the head of Australia’s National Climate Centre at the Bureau of Meteorology from 1986 to 1998. He asserts that oceans warm the atmosphere as opposed to the atmosphere warms the oceans as claimed by many global warming advocates. The infrared radiation given off greenhouse gases cannot penetrate beyond a few centimeters of ocean, fractions of an inch; thus, the atmosphere does not warm the ocean, while sunlight and geothermal events at the bottom do. Unfortunately, Kininmonth combines two properties of water vapor; one property applies to water vapor alone, the other to all greenhouse gases. This has been a common problems since John Tyndall discovered that certain gases in the atmosphere absorb heat energy emitted by Earth, slowing (blocking) the release of that energy to space; thus, slowing Earth’s heat loss. This explained why the land masses of Earth stay warm enough at night to support growing plants, and life itself. With his experiments in spectroscopy beginning in 1859, Tyndall eventually identified that the dominant greenhouse gas was water vapor, giving rise to the confusion. Water involves two distinct processes and one, the water cycle, applies to it alone. Water evaporates, creating water vapor which requires heat for the phase change. Thus, water vapor contains what is called latent heat, which is predominantly from sunlight and some geothermal energy. Convection brings it from the surface of Earth into the upper troposphere which is cooler than the surface and lower troposphere. In the upper troposphere water vapor condenses into liquid water giving off latent heat. The second process of interest is the interaction between heat radiation (infrared, IR) and individual H2O molecules (called water vapor by chemists). Due to a plethora of vibrational and rotational modes of the H2O molecules, they can both absorb and emit IR at a very wide range of wavelengths (“colors,” for lack of a better word). Collisions with atmospheric molecules can energize H2O molecules, which can then radiate IR. Equally, collisions can remove energy, reducing the amount of IR emitted by H2O molecules. The details of these energy-transfer processes depend on atmospheric pressure, atmospheric temperature, and the exact wavelength under consideration; and are carefully calculated by experts like van Wijngaarden and Happer. Such interactions among molecules and IR are loosely termed the greenhouse effect. However, the greenhouse effect is defined by the IPCC as the numerical difference between the amount of IR emitted by the surface and the amount of IR sent to space. The work of van Wijngaarden and Happer recognizes the distinction between the water cycle, which is a driver of convection, and the greenhouse effect. Consequently, they are able to demonstrate how water vapor interferes with the effectiveness of other greenhouse gases such as methane and nitrous oxide, rendering them ineffective as greenhouse gases in Earth’s atmosphere. Unfortunately, William Kininmonth fails to make the important distinction between the role of water vapor in the water cycle and the role of water vapor in the greenhouse effect. See links under Challenging the Orthodoxy – Radiation Transfer and Challenging the Orthodoxy. ****************** Global Climate Model Failure: General Circulation Models, now called Global Climate Models, fail to consider the geological prospective of Earth. We are in a brief warm period during Icehouse Earth with ice caps at both ends. We have no ability to predict when it will end, and glaciation will return. Further, the models cannot predict Dansgaard–Oeschger events (often abbreviated D–O events) and Bond cycles, rapid changes in temperatures which occur every, roughly, 1,500 years – rapid warming followed by slow cooling. John Robson produced a video interview with Javier Vinós along with a post stating some of the many failures of Global Climate Models that Vinós uncovered. Climate change is an extremely complex topic with many uncertainties. To say that the science is settled is absurd. For that reason, TWTW prefers to focus on one of the uncertainties for which we can collect proper data and determine its influence, the role of greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide. The best physical evidence indicates that adding carbon dioxide in today’s atmosphere has a minor impact on influencing temperatures. For topics on which the models fail see links under Model Issues. ****************** UN Failure: Writing in American Thinker, retired economics professor William Hawkins gives an account why the annual UN Conference of Parties (COP) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) have failed to produce binding agreements that have been long sought by some, despite the flashy headlines of dire outcomes if agreements are not reached. Hawkins writes: “The United Nations has been looking for issues deemed larger than the perennial conflicts of traditional geopolitics. It created the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change in 1992 to acquire the authority to run the global economy so as to “save the planet” and “equitably” share the benefits of “sustainable” (i.e., limited) development. It holds a massive conference (over 65,000 attendees) towards the end of each year staged as if governments were adhering to UN mandates. The 29th Conference of the Parties (COP29) in the FCCC series concluded Saturday (Nov. 23) in Baku, Azerbaijan. It ran a day over the two-week schedule as compromise language was hammered out that would allow member states to do as they pleased. As much as the UN bureaucrats hate to admit, the UN is still a member organization, with the world’s leading national governments making the real decisions as to the policies they will adopt to advance the best interests of their citizens. There are no UN mandates. This concept was formally eliminated at COP15 in Copenhagen in 2009. That meeting was the peak of the FCCC campaign with a massive buildup by activist groups around the world for the two years prior. President Barack Obama was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize to encourage him to commit to the UN climate agenda that President George W. Bush had rejected. COP15 was supposed to adopt a “legally binding” treaty to replace the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. The plan had been to impose on the “rich” developed countries a requirement that greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions be cut by 25-to-40 percent by 2020 from 1990 levels. Such a drastic measure would have locked the developed countries into a permanent recession. Meanwhile, the developing countries, led by the BASIC (Brazil, South Africa, India, and China) coalition, would not have had any mandated restrictions on their GHG emissions because they have a sovereign “right” to economic growth. The terminology was “common but differentiated responsibilities.” All must be concerned, but only some (the West) need to do anything about it. In the last days of COP15, President Obama met directly with the BASIC delegates and told them either everyone has a mandate to act, or no one does. The frank result was no one has a mandate. Instead, each nation is simply “called upon” to report to the UN what they are doing about climate change (if anything). The look back at COP15 is important in understanding COP29, as the division between the developed and the developing countries was at the center of the negotiations with the latter again insisting on the old, discarded Kyoto formula. The purpose of the Baku summit was much reduced from past meetings, reflecting the evolution of thought of member states against the demands of the UN bureaucrats. This was apparent in last year’s COP28 held in Dubai (a site which like Baku is based on oil production) There were commitments to triple renewables capacity and double energy efficiency by 2030 and to make progress on adapting to any climate change that occurs rather than curtail (or even reverse) energy use and other human activities in an attempt to prevent climate changes. The favored approach was incremental and cost-conscious. The final language called for “transitioning away from fossil fuels in energy systems, in a just, orderly and equitable manner” (giving plenty of wiggle room) while the term “phasing out” fossil fuels was rejected.” Hawkins discusses that despite dire predictions, the US Energy Information Administration projections show energy use will increase by over 50% by 2050, including increases in coal, natural gas, and nuclear power. BASIC countries (which other identify as BRICS countries) will continue to demand enormous sums of money for slowing economic growth which the use of fossil fuels promotes. [Apparently, the leadership of these countries are not as easily bought off as once thought.] After reviewing the situation, Hawkins concludes: “Even in the fantasy land of the UN, reality rears its head. President Trump’s rejection of the ‘climate emergency’ delirium will not make him an outlier, but a leader in the continuing world-wide effort to build societies in which people can lead better lives on their own terms.” See link under Challenging the Orthodoxy. ****************** Weather Prediction: Meteorologist Cliff Mass argues that the US has fallen behind other countries, particular the EU, in weather predictions, despite spending a great sum of money. In his essay “Make American Weather Prediction Great Again!” Mass asks: “Why is U.S. Government Weather Prediction Lagging?” To which he responds: “The reasons are fairly clear: The U.S. numerical weather prediction effort is divided, with NOAA, the U.S. Navy, the U.S. Air Force, NASA, and the Department of Energy all funding substantial efforts. Resources are sub-optimal at each agency and uncoordinated. All substantially lag the European Center in forecast skill. The capabilities of the large U.S. weather research community are not sufficiently applied by government efforts. This is particularly true of the university-based National Center for Atmospheric Research, which has developed an advanced global prediction model that is not used for global prediction by NOAA or other agencies. NOAA/NWS has grown a large inefficient bureaucracy for the management and development of numerical weather prediction. Responsibilities are divided and duplication is extensive.” To this TWTW adds: We should separate weather prediction entities from climate predictions entities. The two are incompatible and should not be under the same entity – NOAA. Let them stand alone and see how they do. See link under Challenging the Orthodoxy. ****************** Bar Talk or Real? Project Veritas is a conservative group that uses hidden cameras to try to embarrass its subjects. It recorded a person who was under the influence of alcohol and who was described as a consultant to the EPA. That person stated that the EPA was sending billions of dollars to many small select groups to oppose the incoming Trump administration. It is not clear if these assertions are bar talk or are verifiable actions by the EPA. Certainly, the Biden administration misled many with the Inflation Reduction Act in which it allocated billions of dollars for unreliable, expensive, and unneeded wind and solar power. See links under Defending the Orthodoxy. ****************** Number of the Week: Over 7 days. Wind power in the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) has a nameplate capacity of about 3,000 megawatts. For seven days, the wind generated virtually no power. For wind and solar nameplate capacity has little meaning. The BPA transmission system covers about 300,000 square miles primarily in the Pacific Northwest. Imagine the complexity of cold starting that system after 7 days of no power.

Energy Issues – Australia Power Down Blunder Australians are asked to forego their dishwashers for the sake of the grid. By Doomberg, Dec 3, 2024 Link to: Statistical Review of World Energy By Staff, Energy Institute, 2024 If there is a place on Earth where wind and solar technologies should work, it is Australia. The country’s vast coastline and diverse geography bestow nearly ideal conditions for wind energy turbines, and the sun shines brightly and consistently. According to a detailed country-by-country analysis by the World Bank Group, Australia ranks near the top in global solar potential, and some of its largest commercial solar farms can achieve capacity factors in excess of 40%—roughly four times Germany’s average annual performance. By further comparison, similar facilities in the US average about 25%. It didn’t work, mate By John Robson, Climate Discussion Nexus, Dec 4, 2024 Out of Australia we bring you some of the least startling news in some time. Excessive faith in and subsidies into alternative energy have produced an alternative to energy, namely shortages and blackouts. No, wait. That’s not the big unsurprise.

Climate-Change Colonialism Keeps Poor Countries Impoverished Development agencies fund green projects when people need jobs, food and energy. By Bjorn Lomborg, WSJ, Dec. 2, 2024 TWTW Summary: The president of the Copenhagen Consensus writes: “At the latest United Nations climate summit, developing nations slammed rich countries’ pledge to spend $300 billion annually on climate reparations as ‘crumbs.’ The reality is much worse. Wealthy nations likely won’t conjure up $300 billion in new spending. Europe has been roiled by protests against radical climate policies and the 2024 U.S. election was an indictment of, among other things, aggressive climate regulations. Instead, wealthy nations will do what they’ve done before: raid development funds to the detriment of the people they claim to help. Members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development currently spend $223.7 billion a year trying to do good in poor countries through bilateral and multilateral aid and development spending. It is politically much easier for politicians intent on green spending to shift this money to climate purposes than try to get voters to go along with fresh outlays. Rich nations have diverted much of this funding to climate-change initiatives. OECD members spent one-third of their direct development aid on climate in fiscal 2021-22, the most recent year for which data are available. Development banks have twisted their purpose even further: The World Bank last year sent 44% of its lending to climate causes, the African Development Bank 55% and the European Investment Bank 60%. This charade needs to stop. As part of President-elect Trump’s reforms to wasteful government, he should return development aid to policies that make a real difference. Advocates of green aid are right that climate change will hurt poor countries, but almost every other challenge these nations face—from hunger and poverty to disease and poor education—hurts them more. Typically, climate aid is the worst way to improve quality of life or prevent deaths. Some adaptations to extreme weather are prudent. Early-warning systems for hurricanes and dikes can deliver excellent benefits for each dollar spent. But most climate aid does little to help the developing world. What feeble returns it does bring are dwarfed by the good that could have been done if governments spent that money on direct development efforts such as expanding childhood vaccines or improving crops. This is especially true for climate aid that goes toward emission cuts. The very poorest countries in the world are responsible for less than 0.5% of emissions. They don’t need decarbonization. They need growth, which requires access to copious, reliable energy. Given solar and wind power’s unreliability—and consequent reliance on expensive backup power—this will mostly have to come from fossil fuels. Denying these countries access to cheap and reliable energy is equivalent to condemning them to poverty. Perversely, multilateral development banks spend two-thirds of their climate financing—a massive $50 billion a year—on ‘mitigation’ policies, helping poor countries cut carbon emissions and pushing them only to adopt unreliable power sources. When people need jobs and food, it is immoral to give them solar panels instead. Poverty kills nearly 10 million people annually through related problems such as infectious diseases and hunger. By comparison, the climate-change toll is tiny. Extreme weather took an average of 9,000 lives each year over the past decade. There are many core development priorities wealthy nations could fund that would quickly and efficiently save lives and create economic growth. These include reducing the scourges of malaria and tuberculosis, improving learning outcomes and cutting maternal and neonatal deaths. Carbon mitigation in poorer countries, on the other hand, will generate only a minuscule temperature reduction about a century from now.” Mr. Lomborg states that “climate aid” money is lost and that actual development, not green policy, is needed in poorer nations. Why Are UK Electricity Prices So High? Or more accurately, why are UK electricity prices going up and up and up? It’s that nice Mr Miliband, the self-appointed global pied piper of the energy transition, and his coterie of 6th form lunatic advisors… “”Miliband is retaining his long-term advisers. Guiding the UK’s energy policy operation will be climate activist Tobias Garnett, the former coordinator of Extinction Rebellion’s legal strategy team who represented the road-gluing activists in court. Garnett believes our trajectory is currently “descending swiftly into a politics of ecofascism forged in the crucible of scarce resources, droughts, floods, climate wars and forced migration.” Also on the team is Jonty Leibowitz, whose passion is arguing for socialist reforms to football […] A 100% tax “imposed on transfers from abroad“. Just like China’s… … When it comes to his energy brief Leibowitz’ contribution is a policy paper which argues that “regional banking” should be forcibly re-oriented to “financing the energy transition“. Ideas shared by radical Corbynite and “green” bank devotee Miatta Fahnbulleh – recently appointed energy minister… [Special advisor] SpAd Eleanor Salter’s focus is “integrating nature into the climate offer“. Salter thinks a “fundamental shift” is required to deal with the “climate breakdown“, which includes “taking many cars off the roads altogether.” Her other “nature” proposals include allowing anyone to traipse across private property to make “the countryside open to all” https://order-order.com/2024/08/12/revealed-milibands-extreme-left-policy-team/ Fossil fuel interests and the public at large are in real trouble with this lot. In fact, the exodus from the North sea started last summer. This is terrific but those who need to read it won’t. The ship of climate change has been on-course to disaster for 30+ well-funded and well-promoted years. During those years the growth of safe-clean-reliable and cost-efficient nuclear power has been stalled. Electricity generation from nuclear (Ember and Energy Institute) https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/nuclear-energy-generation?tab=chart&country=~OWID_WRL “The United States invariably does the right thing, after having exhausted every other alternative.” — Winston Churchillhttps://quotes.guide/winston-churchill/quote/the-united-states-invariably-does-the-right-thing-after-having-exhausted-every-other-alternative/ “Commentators such as Francis Menton have called for a demonstration project showing that a modern city or community can thrive on wind and solar plus storage.” I follow and appreciate Menton’s great insights on these technical and societal issues, but I believe that a large-scale city-wide project is unnecessary. I believe that single household will do just as well and will give the necessary results a lot quicker, or at least for a lot less cost. I would start with an existing house somewhere in Kansas, near the geographical center of the nation. The household would have to create all of its energy resources for heating, cooling, automotive (including vacations), and electrical needs, ON ITS OWN PROPERTY. I would allow purchase of BEV charging while on vacations. On-property storage of on-site generated electrical energy would be required for all energy needs. This would require a house with quite a bit of property to safely place all of the wind, solar, and battery or other storage requirements. No grid connection would be allowed. Any depletion of storage would be considered a failure of the project and require a reset of the project start time. I submit that the ability of the project to run a full year, from noon June 21 to noon June 21 of the next year would constitute project success, and then the cost of the project would be scaled up to project the expected cost for the entire nation. At each interim project failure (running out of storage or equipment breakdown), the entire costs to the date of the failure would also be projected as a “more than” cost for the entire nation. I contend that the project will never succeed before the projected costs will exceed even what the most Liberal blue state governance would accept (though, I expect that at least several would attempt to ignore the results). ‘I would start with an existing house somewhere in Kansas, near the geographical center of the nation. The household would have to create all of its energy resources for heating, cooling, automotive (including vacations), and electrical needs, ON ITS OWN PROPERTY.’ Except for the reference to automobiles and electricity, it sounds a lot like “Little House on the Prairie”. But that’s the Left’s objective isn’t it? Absolute power for themselves, liquidation of their opponents and a 19th century subsistence existence for the remaining masses. I’d bet against you on this one. My 2400 square foot cabin easily gets by on 18 m^2 solar panels and a bank of lead acid deep cells. I use maybe 50 gallons of propane for hot water and the stove. Wood for heating – I’ve 5 acres and get plenty of wood from it. I don’t live there even half time, but the systems are barely breaking a sweat. There are lots of off grid homes is what I’m saying. It is generally agreed that the lapse rate and the greenhouse effect are directly tied to each other. Water can change both the slope and the Y intercept of the lapse rate. CO2 can only change the intercept. Kininmonth … asserts that oceans warm the atmosphere as opposed to the atmosphere warms the oceans as claimed by many global warming advocates. There is no doubt in my mind whatsoever that when it comes to polar and tropical mesoscale cyclones, that they draw their energy from the ocean surface through latent heat predominantly in the tropics as opposed to sensible heat in the polar regions. Although I haven’t studies midlatitutes in depth, I can believe the mechanisms are more complex there.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Bitcoin just dropped below $100K for the fifth time this week. Those sell orders aren't slowing down. While Bitcoin is stumbling, something interesting is happening with Ethereum. See, the market's been so focused on Bitcoin's six-figure dream that most people missed what's happening on Ethereum's charts. The patterns? They're starting to look eerily similar to the ones we saw right before 2021's massive run. Ethereum needs a 24% weekly gain to hit its all-time high. Usually, that would sound ambitious. But with BlackRock injecting $500M into ETH holdings and institutional money flowing in, the numbers are starting to make sense. Even the analysts who've been bearish since 2022 are changing their tune. They're talking about "structural changes" and sustainable growth - words they don't throw around lightly. The really interesting part? The resistance levels between here and the all-time high are surprisingly thin. It's like someone cleared the path while we weren't looking. So what's actually going on in the crypto markets right now? Let me break down today's biggest stories... PEPE coin flips Uniswap with an $11B market cap. So what's pumping its price so high? 🤔 Alt season signals are flashing - HBAR +99%, IOTA +79%, JASMY +72%. But what concerning signals is the perpetual futures market showing? 📊 Ethereum ETFs hit a 10-day winning streak. What's sparking such a huge interest in it now? 💫 Bitcoin keeps bouncing off $100K like it's made of rubber. Here’s what's causing this rigid resistance! 🔍 Trump's David Sacks steps in to battle "Operation Choke Point 2.0" as Coinbase shares evidence. What are they? ⚖️ Let’s dive in! PEPE just accomplished something that seemed impossible a few months ago - it jumped over Uniswap in market value. Pepe coin, which started as yet another meme token in 2023, now sits at an $11 billion market cap. That's bigger than Uniswap's UNI token, one of DeFi's cornerstone projects. The surge isn't just a short-term spike either. Since January, Pepe's value has multiplied 18 times, turning what many dismissed as a joke into a serious market player. So what’s pumping its price so high? Read the full story! The alts market is painting an interesting picture right now. Some tokens are going absolutely wild - Hedera jumped 99%, IOTA climbed 79%, and JasmyCoin shot up 72% since November. Meanwhile, Bitcoin's grip on the market is loosening. Its dominance dropped below 55% for the first time in months, sparking debates about whether we're entering the alt-season territory. But there's a problem. The perpetual futures market is showing some concerning signals. What are they? Read the full story! Ethereum ETFs just hit a milestone - 10 straight days of money flowing in, pushing the weekly total to a staggering $836.7 million. Fidelity is leading the charge, with their Ethereum Fund pulling in $47.9 million in a single day. The total trading volume is hitting record after record, approaching $1 billion daily. The timing couldn't be more perfect. Ethereum just broke past $4,000, hitting levels we haven't seen since March. And it's not just the price - the NFT market is showing signs of life again, with top projects posting double-digit gains. But remember when analysts were calling ETH ETF a gigantic failure just a few months ago? What’s sparking such a huge interest in it now? Read the full story! Bitcoin crossed 100K again, only to fall back to 99K (again). Back in 2011, you could buy a Bitcoin for just $1. Two years later, it hit $1,000, and people thought that was crazy. Now? We're talking about six figures. So what’s causing this rigid resistance? Read the full story! David Sacks, Trump's new AI and Crypto Czar, is stepping into a battle that's been brewing beneath the surface of crypto regulations - the mysterious "Operation Choke Point 2.0." The story starts with Silvergate Bank's collapse. Chris Lane, their former CTO, stated that the bank was perfectly solvent after FTX's fall, but regulators systematically cut off their ability to serve crypto clients until they had no choice but to shut down. Now Coinbase has entered the chat with some explosive evidence. What are they? Read the full story! Sign in to access your portfolio

Golub, which had more than $70 billion of capital under management as of Oct. 1, has received preliminary approval for a licence to operate out of the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM), the emirate's financial centre, it said in a statement, adding that it had also appointed Naser Almutairi as managing director for the Middle East. "We've had clients in the region for over a decade...We are eager to expand our business and to expand our client service," CEO Lawrence Golub told Reuters in an interview. He said the office is expected to open in January but declined to say how many staff it would have. The presence of sovereign wealth funds, an attractive regulatory environment and an increasing number of high net worth individuals were among the factors influencing the decision, he said. The announcement came as global and regional financiers gathered in the UAE's capital city for the first day of the Abu Dhabi Finance Week annual conference. The emirate, which holds 90% of the UAE's oil reserves, has accelerated efforts to diversify its economy with ADGM striving to become a global hub. Although it trails neighbouring Dubai's DIFC financial centre, ADGM's assets under management reached $157.2 billion by the end of June with firms including the family office of billionaire Ray Dalio and hedge fund Brevan Howard. It is also attracting firms active in private credit, an asset class expected to grow to $2.6 trillion by 2029 from $1.5 trillion at the end of 2023, according to Preqin data, as stricter regulations make it more expensive for traditional lenders to finance riskier loans. Golub, which focuses on middle and upper middle market companies, is planning further investment activities in the Middle East, the CEO said, adding that it was "very seriously" considering applying for a licence in Saudi Arabia, where it saw "big potential", although this would not happen next year.

It is also attracting firms active in private credit, which has grown rapidly in recent years as stricter regulations make it more expensive for traditional lenders to finance riskier loans. The asset class is expected to grow to $2.6 trillion by 2029 from $1.5 trillion at the end of last year, according to Preqin data. BlackRock said last week that it would invest about $12 billion to buy private credit firm HPS Investment Partners. Gulf sovereign wealth funds are also expanding in the private credit space, including Abu Dhabi's $330 billion Mubadala, which has forged partnerships with the likes of Apollo and Goldman Sachs in recent years and last week said it would buy a 42% stake in U.S. credit asset manager Silver Rock Financial.

Title: Will Amazon Buy Bitcoin? Shareholders Propose 5% Investment
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/will-amazon-buy-bitcoin-shareholders/
Time Published: 2024-12-09T07:00:02Z
Full Content:
Shareholders of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) have submitted a proposal urging the $2.3 trillion technology conglomerate to consider adding Bitcoin to its balance sheet. The measure, submitted by the National Center for Public Policy Research and slated for discussion at Amazon’s 2025 annual shareholder meeting in April, calls on the company’s Board to assess whether incorporating BTC as a treasury asset would serve the best long-term interests of shareholders. In the proposal, shareholders stress that Amazon’s current treasury management may be insufficient in the face of ongoing inflation. As stated in the submission: “Corporations that invest their assets wisely can – and often do – increase shareholder value more than more profitable businesses that don’t.” According to the supporting materials, Amazon’s current treasury includes approximately $88 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, out of a total $585 billion in assets (as of September 30, 2024). The proposal’s authors argue that inflationary pressures and sub-inflationary bond yields are eroding the purchasing power of these holdings. They cite a US Consumer Price Index (CPI) average annual rate of 4.95% over the past four years, at times peaking at 9.1%, while suggesting that “in reality, the true inflation rate is significantly higher.” Against this backdrop, the submission suggests that Amazon has a “fiduciary duty” to consider inflation-resistant assets. The shareholders point to Bitcoin’s historical returns to bolster their case. They note that as of December 6, 2024, BTC price rose 131% over the previous year, outperforming corporate bonds “by 126% on average.” Over a five-year horizon, Bitcoin’s price increased by 1,246%, surpassing corporate bond returns by an estimated 1,242% during that period. “Amazon should – and perhaps has a fiduciary duty to – consider adding assets to its treasury that appreciate more than bonds, even if those assets are more volatile short-term,” the proposal states. The document also references other publicly listed firms that hold BTC. MicroStrategy, one of the earliest corporate adopters, saw its stock outperform Amazon’s by 537% over the previous year, according to the proposal. In addition, institutional players such as BlackRock and Fidelity—both of which hold significant stakes in Amazon—have introduced Bitcoin-focused investment products for their clients. The shareholders further suggest that U.S. government policy could shift toward a “Bitcoin strategic reserve” by 2025, possibly signaling broader mainstream acceptance. “Shareholders request that the Board conduct an assessment to determine if adding Bitcoin to the Company’s treasury is in the best long-term interests of shareholders,” the proposal concludes. This push at Amazon comes on the heels of a similar initiative at Microsoft. As reported by Bitcoinist, Microsoft (MSF) shareholders are set to vote on December 10 on a proposal to include Bitcoin in its treasury as a reserve asset. However, analysts note that the chances of approval are low after the Microsoft Board recommended a “no” vote. At press time, BTC traded at $99,136. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

That’s according to Sean Dawson, head of research at DeFi derivatives protocol Derive. “We continue to see a 10.5% probability of Ethereum reaching $6,000 and a 6% likelihood for Bitcoin surpassing $150,000 by January 31,” Dawson told Decrypt. “Regarding the 25 delta skews, they've remained stable since last week, showing no significant shifts, Dawson added. “It appears the market has consolidated its position over the weekend.” The 25 delta skew measures the market's bias between calls and puts, and its stability suggests traders' expectations for price direction or risk haven't shifted significantly. It follows Bitcoin’s run above its $100,000 price tag on Wednesday and the significant volatility that followed 12 hours later, which saw the asset dip to an eight-day low of $92,000. Bitcoin’s price has since regained ground, remaining flat on the day at $99,260, CoinGecko data shows. “The weekend usually results in quieter markets and subdued price movements, Dawson explained. Pointing to factors including MicroStrategy flows and BlackRock IBIT options having an outsized impact on Bitcoin’s pricing, Dawson said weekend trading “tends to reduce volatility,” giving the market a “chance to stabilize.” Bitcoin has recaptured the imagination of retail and institutional investors after President-elect Donald Trump clinched a decisive victory in the 2024 elections, held last month. Trump has promised to implement a strategic Bitcoin reserve in the U.S. while protecting the interests of domestic crypto mining firms and those offering industry-related services. Meanwhile, exchange-traded fund flows for major issuers, including BlackRock and Fidelity, continue to post impressive records, with the former rising to become the world’s fastest fund to reach the $50 billion assets under management. “With the market in unchartered territory, we are now in a new price discovery zone,” Singapore-based QCP Capital wrote in a note on Wednesday. “We have returned to a binary scenario, where the spot price could either be driven higher, or selling pressure could push it back below $100,000.

Title: Amazon shareholders urge company to allocate at least 5% of its assets to Bitcoin

Hit your long-term targets. Earn up to 16% per year on digital assets. Share this article A group of Amazon shareholders is pushing for the company to allocate a minimum of 5% of its assets to Bitcoin, through a proposal submitted by the National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR), a free-market principles advocacy think tank. Source: @TimKotzman The proposal, shared by Tim Kotzman, recommends Bitcoin addition to Amazon’s treasury as a hedge against inflation and asset diversification strategy. It cites Bitcoin’s superior performance compared to traditional assets like corporate bonds, while pointing to existing Bitcoin investments by companies such as MicroStrategy and Tesla. “MicroStrategy, which holds Bitcoin on its balance sheet, has had its stock outperform Amazon stock by 537% in the previous year. And they’re not alone. Institutional and corporate Bitcoin adoption is becoming more commonplace: more public companies such as Tesla and Block have added Bitcoin to their balance sheets, Amazon’s second and fourth largest institutional shareholders—BlackRock and Fidelity, respectively—offer their clients a Bitcoin ETF, and the US government may form a Bitcoin strategic reserve in 2025,” the letter wrote. The proposal calls for Amazon’s board to evaluate whether Bitcoin treasury allocation serves shareholders’ long-term interests. Amazon has not issued a public response to the proposal, though the company has previously demonstrated interest in blockchain technology, particularly in supply chain management. The NCPPR’s proposal is part of a broad institutional push toward Bitcoin adoption. In October, the think tank sent a similar letter to Microsoft urging Bitcoin investment consideration. Microsoft’s board has advised shareholders to vote against their proposal, stating they already consider “a wide range of investable assets,” including Bitcoin. If Microsoft opts against Bitcoin investments and the digital asset’s value subsequently increases, the NCPPR warns it may end up in shareholder litigation. Microsoft shareholders are set to vote on their Bitcoin consideration proposal on December 10. Once a shareholder proposal is filed, Amazon’s board of directors will review it and decide whether to include it in Amazon’s proxy statement for the upcoming annual shareholders meeting. If the proposal is added to the proxy statement, shareholders will vote on it at the annual meeting, scheduled for April 2025. The outcome of the vote will depend on the number of votes in favor of and against the proposal. Similar to Microsoft, the Amazon board of directors typically provides a recommendation on how shareholders should vote regarding each proposal. Top Amazon shareholders include major financial institutions like Vanguard Group, BlackRock, State Street, Fidelity Management & Research, Geode Capital Management, and JPMorgan.

Title: AI Adoption Still in ‘Very Early’ Stages, BlackRock Exec Says

Investment giant BlackRock expects 2025 to be a big year for infrastructure and cybersecurity. And the artificial intelligence (AI) boom will play a major role in those investments, Jay Jacobs, BlackRock’s U.S. head of thematic and active ETFs, told CNBC in a report published Saturday (Dec. 7). “It’s still very early in the AI adoption cycle,” he said. He added that AI firms need to build out their data centers, while protecting that data will likely be a wise investment in the new year. “If you think about your data, you want to spend more on cybersecurity as it gets more valuable,” he said. “We think this is really going to benefit the cybersecurity [and the] software community, which is seeing very rapid revenue growth based off of this AI.” In addition, Jacobs sees a broader impact when it comes to the infrastructure that supports AI. As “magical” as the tech might be, it’s important to remember the physical things — power, chips, real estate — that support it. “It’s not just something that lives in the ether, in the cloud, there’s real physical things that have to happen, and that means energy, that means more materials like copper, that means more real estate. You really have to think about kind of the physical infrastructure that underlies it.” And as PYMNTS wrote last week, this is a costly infrastructure, as running advanced programs requires massive data centers and specialized processors. For example, Microsoft’s partnership with OpenAI required building several AI supercomputers, each powered by thousands of Nvidia A100 GPUs. These installations eat up significant amounts of power, as training a large language model (LLM) can use the same amount of energy as thousands of households. “This pressure has sparked innovation in software architecture,” that report said. “Google has pioneered various optimization techniques, such as quantization, which reduces the precision of numbers required in calculations while maintaining model performance. Meta achieved efficiency gains with its Llama AI models through architectural improvements, allowing smaller models to perform strongly while using fewer parameters.” With this in mind, PYMNTS wrote, major tech companies are racing to shrink their AI systems, marking a major shift in the industry. “The process, known as AI optimization, involves refining complex software systems to improve their performance while reducing the computing power they need to run,” PYMNTS wrote. “These efficiency improvements can transform challenging economics into sustainable operations for companies that rely on massive computing systems.” We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

Title: Jordie Barrett makes try-scoring Leinster debut in Champions Cup win over Bristol

This was a curiously unexceptional game for large tracts of a windy night in Bristol, dominated by the French referee Pierre Brousset and a variety of incomplete or interminable scrums, which seemed like it would never end. Yet it was also truly memorable, not least as a potential sign of more great things to come, when Leinster introduced their A-listers and their ‘A’ game. Jordie Barrett having been introduced during the interval for what would be a quietly outstanding debut, within five minutes Leo Cullen completed probably the best quintet of substitutions in the history of the province, namely Andrew Porter, Thomas Clarkson, RG Snyman and Caelan Doris in addition to Barrett. Jacques Nienaber had warned that Bristol were the kind of team that could score 21 points in 17 minutes, but as it transpired it was Leinster that scored 21 points in a whirlwind six-minute spell. The big hitters were central to this salvo, not least the try-scoring, all-action Barrett, while Sam Prendergast capped off a typically cool night’s work in his first Champions Cup start to bookend that decisive spell with two tries in a 20-minute haul. Yet the night had not been without its difficulties, with Leinster reduced to 13 men, whereupon nobody stood up to be counted more than Josh van der Flier, who maintained his rich form from the Autumn Series with a deserving try of his own in man of the match performance. [ Toulouse run Ulster ragged in statement Champions Cup winOpens in new window ] While the TV pictures might have masked the conditions, there was a steady downpour in the opening quarter which thankfully abated but, in tandem with the swirling after-effects of Storm Darragh, made for a very scrappy opening. On the tightly cropped Ashton Gate surface used by Bristol City, players frequently lost their footing early on. This may also have contributed to the three penalties, and an indirect penalty, against Leinster at scrum time in addition to one in their favour as the typically fastidious and irritating Brousset renewed acquaintances with the ex-Clermont tighthead Rabah Slimani, who will be up against his former team at the Aviva next Saturday (5.30pm). Leinster were possibly a bit too elaborate and overplayed their hand and actually looked more dangerous through their all-or-nothing, fast defensive line speed than when they had the ball. The same was true of Bristol after losing their former Blackrock College product and Connacht Pro12-winning outhalf AJ MacGinty within five minutes when he was almost cut in two by the flying Garry Ringrose. Such were the reverberations from the tackle that MacGinty had to go off for an HIA and did not return. Leinster had survived a couple of five metre lineouts, James Ryan making one good steal, while van der Flier made inroads after a neat short side exchange with Rónan Kelleher before some sleight of hand on the deck went unseen. Prendergast was unlucky that his booming, spiralling 50 metre touch-finder was blown out on the full and when Jack Boyle was pinged for side entry, Kelleher was then binned for a similar offence before Max Deegan followed suit when tripping Fitz Harding in the act of tackling Harry Randall, which was actually quite a trick. Bristol launched Viliame Mata off the next five-metre lineout before Max Lahiff burrowed over and, trailing 7-0, Leinster had another seven minutes to survive with 13 men. But, necessity being the mother of invention, they did more than just survive. They were helped by James Dun spilling the restart, which Jordan Larmour retrieved and, with their numerical disadvantage, Leinster were obliged to be more direct. The fired-up van der Flier, responding to their moments of dire need, carried hard again and Jamison Gibson-Park worked a penalty advantage. Playing with house money, Prendergast chipped deftly and the added bonus was that Rich Lane slid into the ball and slid it into the waiting arms of Larmour who had followed up to gather and score. Prendergast used up the full allotment of time for the conversion and 7-7 at the break was a result for Leinster considering the penalty count was 9-3 against them. As well as the returning Deegan, Leinster welcomed Barrett aboard as a half-time replacement for Ciarán Frawley. Cue the rest of the Bomb Squad. Barrett, employed at inside centre with Robbie Henshaw moving to 13, Ringrose to the right wing and Larmour to the left, immediately made his mark with a good tackle to force a turnover. Yet, there was a little sign of their dramatic input to come initially when Brousset binned both Lahiff and the newly introduced Porter for stepping back when another scrum collapsed and his patience snapped. But, curiously it preceded the defining spell of the match and ironically the Leinster scrum was the platform. From a scrum to the left on the Bristol 22, Gibson-Park fed Barrett and Prendergast looped around to take the pullback and drift through an inviting gap before arcing and dummying to score under the posts. Within two minutes a scrum penalty for Leinster gave them an attacking lineout on the Bristol 22. The ever-alert Gibson-Prink spotted space on the fringe for a telling incision and two phases later Barrett took Gibson-Park’s pass and the Bristol defence bought his dummy as he sliced through himself. The ink barely dry in the referee’s notebook, Leinster struck again with the try of the match. Barrett’s pass had given the visitor’s the width in their own 22 when Doris and Snyman combined deftly to release the secondrow for one of his galloping breaks as he ate up about 40 metres and passed to Prendergast, who fended Randall and carried on from over 40 metes out for his second try. Stunning stuff. Almost funny. The fifth try was more prosaic, a nice launch from a fake maul set-up but a thoroughly deserving score for van der Flier, Prendergast’s conversion completing his 20-point haul. There was a consolation try by the quick-footed Gabriel Ibitoye when latching on to Kieran Marmion’s clever grubber, but the conversion was missed, meaning Leinster maintained their improved defensive record. Jacques Nienaber looked happy too. Scoring sequence: 30 mins: Lahiff try, van Rensburg con 7-0; 33: Larmour try, Prendergast con 7-7; Half-time 7-7; 53: Prendergast try and con 7-14; 56: Barrett try, Prendergast con 7-21; 58: Prendergast try and con 7-28; 65: van der Flier try, Prendergast con 7-35; 73: Ibitoye try 12-35.

Title: ServiceNow, Inc. (NOW) Receives ‘Buy’ Rating as AI-Driven Solutions Boost Growth Prospects

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Top 10 AI News Stories For The Weekend. In this article, we are going to take a look at where ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) stands against other top AI news stories for the weekend. Last week, Sam Altman, CEO of AI company OpenAI, expressed his confidence that US President-elect Donald Trump’s administration will support the artificial intelligence sector, ensuring the United States and its allies continue their lead. Altman told US broadcaster Fox News that AI technology needed massive infrastructure support and that Trump would be ideal in providing it. READ ALSO: 15 AI News Updates That Broke The Internet and 15 Buzzing AI Stocks Making Headlines “We need to build that here and we need to be able to have the best AI infrastructure in the world to be able to lead with the technology and the capabilities. I believe President-elect Trump will be very good at that”. Trump has already picked out Silicon Valley venture capitalist David Sacks as his AI and Crypto czar, stating that Sacks will ensure the legal framework for the token has “clarity” to empower the crypto industry to “thrive”. Trump’s decision to appoint Sacks demonstrates his industry-friendly stance toward emerging technologies. “David will focus on making America the clear global leader in both areas. He will safeguard Free Speech online, and steer us away from Big Tech bias and censorship”. Meanwhile, SpaceX founder Elon Musk emerged as a key advisor to Trump after the elections. Musk has also been appointed to co-lead the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, which is responsible for streamlining government bureaucracy. Musk having a potential political influence in the administration, particularly when it comes to AI, could get some people worried. However, prominent figures such as Sam Altman say they aren’t. Altman brushed off suggestions that Musk, the owner of X, would use legal tactics to shut down competitors. Matt Calkins, CEO of Appian, is also confident about Musk’s influence on the Trump administration, stating how the influence is positive because Musk “deeply” knows artificial intelligence. The growing momentum of AI, underscored by recent government developments, has brought attention to other key players in the sector, including Anthropic, a leading AI-focused company. Anthropic is collaborating with Amazon to develop one of the world’s most powerful AI supercomputers. The mega-project, codenamed “Project Rainer,” will be five times larger than the cluster used to build Anthropic’s current most advanced model. As reported by WIRED, the announcement was made at the company’s Re:Invent conference in Las Vegas by Matt Garman, CEO of AWS. Once it is completed, the supercomputer will be the world’s largest AI machine featuring hundreds of thousands of its latest Trainium 2 AI training chips. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A team of software engineers at desks working on code for a cutting-edge cloud computing solution. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 78 ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) is a cloud-based platform that leverages AI and machine learning to enable enterprises to streamline workflow automation, enhance IT service management, and optimize other enterprise applications. On December 5, Analyst Michael Turrin of Wells Fargo assigned a “Buy” rating on ServiceNow with a price target of $1,250.00. Gina Mastantuono, company CFO, expressed cautious optimism regarding 2025 IT budgets, indicating potential growth beyond 2024. The company is well-suited to provide clients with both revenue-generating and cost-saving solutions. In particular, ServiceNow’s strong focus on artificial intelligence, predominantly through initiatives such as its early adoption through the Xanadu initiative and the Now Assist platform, puts it on track for future growth. The company’s focus on enhancing customer service through AI and database offerings, including RaptorDB Pro and Knowledge Graph, further emphasizes innovation and efficiency. Lastly, increased operating leverage and ongoing cost efficiencies solidify the buy rating. Overall, NOW ranks 1st on our list of top AI news stories for the weekend. While we acknowledge the potential of NOW as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NOW but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Falcon Cloud Security empowers organizations to close critical gaps, outpace threats, and scale their security for the future on a single, unified platform”.
