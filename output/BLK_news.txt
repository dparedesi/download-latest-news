Ireland head coach Scott Bemand has defended the inclusion of two new players in Ireland’s World Cup preparation. It comes after former England international Ellena Perry was named to make her debut off the bench in Saturday’s warm-up match against Canada in Belfast. Perry, who earned the last of her 11 England caps in 2020 and therefore satisfies World Rugby’s stand down rules for switching nations, qualifies through an Irish grandparent. She was brought into the set-up a few weeks ago but, with tighthead prop Christy Haney struggling to make the World Cup squad due to a hamstring injury, Bemand has decided to play Perry as loosehead cover on the bench. Perry is the second new player from outside the Irish system given a debut in as many weeks. Last weekend, Exeter centre Nancy McGillivray, who has been named in England squads without ever being capped, debuted after qualifying through her Irish-born father. She has been on Ireland’s radar for some time, but only became available after her England contract expired in June. Both Perry and McGillivray are expected to be named in the final World Cup squad, to be announced on Monday. Perry is likely to come in for the injured Haney, while McGillivray is not expected to oust any of Eve Higgins, Aoife Dalton or Enya Breen, Ireland’s centres from the Six Nations. Instead, an outside back is likely to make way. Ahead of Saturday’s game in Belfast, Bemand was asked if introducing players from outside the system so close to the competition risked upsetting the squad dynamic. “If done incorrectly [yes],” he said. “But with Christy [Haney] picking up the hamstring niggle we needed to bring in and supplement front row. So actually, everything has been done well, in my opinion. [ Former England prop Ellena Perry in line to make Ireland debut against CanadaOpens in new window ] “Elle [Perry] is a good player, and she’s a really good person, having worked with her before. She’s known to a good few of the girls [Perry is teammates of Neve Jones and Sam Monaghan at Gloucester] and they would endorse that.” While the new caps can be explained by injury and waiting for contracts to expire, that Ireland looked externally may send a message that the current development pathways don’t have World Cup-ready players. Uncapped Ulster and Railway prop Sophie Barrett was one name overlooked by the inclusion of Perry. Yet, other inclusions, such as the potential World Cup place for Under-20 forward Beth Buttimer, would push back against that narrative, one which Bemand is keen to dispel. “If you look at the number of players now coming through from the women’s national talent squad, in girls that are getting touch points through Sevens, through Celtic Challenge, through the Under-20s, our depth is night and day to how it looked two years ago. “Sophie’s [Barrett] nearly ready and if we had to call Sophie up, we’d be confident in what Sophie’s capabilities are. She also hasn’t played Test match rugby yet. “Ivana Kiripati, Ailish Quinn, Jemima Adams Verde ... we’ve got three players that have had touch points with the 20s in the near recent past. Ailish came on and got a first cap last week against Scotland. “So girls coming through the pathway, through the Under-20s is significant. It’s brilliant. I’m excited for the future.” IRELAND (v Canada, World cup-warm-up, Affidea Stadium, Belfast, Saturday, 12pm): Stacey Flood (Railway Union/Leinster); Béibhinn Parsons (Blackrock College/Connacht), Aoife Dalton (Old Belvedere/Leinster), Enya Breen (Blackrock College/Munster), Anna McGann (Railway Union); Dannah O’Brien (Old Belvedere/Leinster), Aoibheann Reilly (Blackrock College/Connacht); Niamh O’Dowd (Old Belvedere/Leinster), Neve Jones (Gloucester Hartpury), Linda Djougang (Old Belvedere/Leinster); Ruth Campbell (Old Belvedere/Leinster), Fiona Tuite (Old Belvedere/Ulster); Grace Moore (Trailfinders/IQ Rugby), Ivana Kiripati (Creggs/Connacht), Brittany Hogan (Old Belvedere/Ulster).

Title: Transport authority approves settlement of Swords BusConnects corridor legal action
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/ireland/dublin/2025/08/08/transport-authority-approves-settlement-of-swords-busconnects-corridor-legal-action/

The board of the National Transport Authority (NTA) has approved a proposed settlement to halt legal action taken against its planned BusConnects corridor from Swords to Dublin city centre. The NTA would not disclose the terms of the settlement, but the board’s approval raises hopes judicial review proceedings will be dropped to allow construction of the 12km route granted planning permission more than a year ago. The Swords corridor is one of 12 segregated bus routes to be built as part of the €4 billion scheme to transform the capital’s bus services. The planned route runs from the south side of Swords town in north Dublin, past Dublin Airport and through Santry along the Swords Road, then along the Drumcondra Road and Dorset Street to the top of O’Connell Street and Parnell Square. The NTA secured permission from An Bord Pleanála for the route in June of last year, but judicial review proceedings against the board’s decision were initiated in August by two separate parties: owners of a business park near the airport and a veterinary practice south of Swords. The cases have not yet been heard in the High Court but in their submissions to An Bord Pleanála both Brendan Collins, of Collinstown Business Park, and Conor O’Scanaill, of O’Scanaill Veterinary Surgeons, raised concerns about the effect the bus corridor would have on their properties. Minutes of a recent NTA board meeting show details of a “settlement proposal” were presented to the board by interim NTA chief executive Hugh Creegan. “Following the overview provided, the board approved the terms of the proposed agreement to settle the particular judicial reviews proceedings being taken in relation to the Swords to City Centre Core Bus Corridor scheme,” the minutes state. This is the first settlement approved by the board in an effort to bring an end to legal action taken against one of the bus corridor schemes. Of the 12 corridors, judicial review proceedings have been taken in relation to seven, the corridors from Swords, Clongriffin, Belfield/Blackrock, Blanchardstown, Templeogue/Rathfarnham, Bray and Kimmage. The other five now have “full” planning permission as the time frame by which they could be challenged in the courts has expired. These are the routes from Ballymun/Finglas, Liffey Valley, Ringsend, Tallaght/Clondalkin and Lucan. [ BusConnects route will come in ‘on time, on budget’, says Darragh O’BrienOpens in new window ] Green Party transport spokesman Feljin Jose said the delays caused by the judicial reviews were extremely concerning. “The NTA has to build three of these at the same time over the next four to five years to get this done this side of 2035. Seven out of the 12 approved corridors in judicial review is not a good return rate and will add at least a year, maybe up to two years, delay.” The settlement of the Swords cases would be a win for Dubliners, he said. “Without knowing the details of the settlement I can only say it’s good news if the cases are dropped and the quicker we can get this done and have bus priority and improved cycling and pedestrian infrastructure.” The plaintiffs and their legal representatives declined to comment on the settlement agreement. A spokeswoman for the NTA said it could not comment on the details of the proposed agreement “other than to acknowledge that the board approved the terms of the agreement at the June board” meeting. Construction of the first core bus corridor from Liffey Valley to the city centre is due to begin next month.

Title: Rugby’s next generation: Meet the rising stars of Leinster, Ulster, Connacht and Munster
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/rugby/2025/08/08/irelands-next-gen-whos-who-in-the-four-provincial-rugby-academies/

Connacht academy manager Eric Elwood knows the value of a good young ‘un having led the Ireland Under-20s to a Grand Slam in 2007. So it’s no surprise that the province’s first-year intake for next season includes three players – flanker Bobby Power, hooker Mikey Yarr and secondrow David Walsh – from Neil Doak’s national age-grade squad. Another, number eight Aaron O’Brien, would have played but for injury. Connacht welcome eight players into the academy – five from Leinster in Yarr, Walsh, Dan Ryan, an Ireland Under-19 international wing educated at St Michael’s College, and outhalf Conor O’Shaughnessy, who played All-Ireland League for Blackrock College last season having made the short journey to Stradbrook from the school. O’Brien was a standout schools player at St Mary’s College and also in underage representative rugby with Leinster and Ireland. They join Power, fellow Galway man Seán Walsh, a centre who has represented Ireland at Under-19 international level, and backrow Diarmuid O’Connell from Carrick-on-Shannon. Elwood’s decision to recruit outside the province is sensible and underlines that he is looking to attract the best young players into the pathway. Newbridge-born prop Billy Bohan is in his second year, while wing James Nicholson (Wicklow) and hooker Matthew Victory (Dublin) are in their final year. Connacht are not alone in this respect as Ulster and Munster also have players born in Leinster in their respective academies, hardly a surprise given the numbers game, not least population size. Ulster have persuaded Balbriggan-born wing Aitzol Arenzana-King, a former Irish 20s Grand Slam winner, to make the journey to Belfast where he will join Dubliners Sam Berman and Tom Brigg, along with South African-born centre Wilhelm de Klerk, who came to Dublin as a 10-year-old and played rugby in St Michael’s. Richie Murphy’s Grand Slam and World Cup exploits with the Irish 20s was a facilitator in attracting some top young players to Ulster from outside the province. Hooker Connor Magee, prop Flynn Longstaff, promising outhalf Daniel Green and wing Josh Gibson join Arenzana-King as the five new faces in the academy. Props George Hadden, from Gorey, and Ronan Foxe from Rahugh near Tullamore are in their final year in the Munster academy. The first-year intake of five players includes two, Oisín Minogue and Tom Wood, fought their way into starting positions with the Irish 20s despite being a year young for the grade. Openside flanker Minogue got better with every opportunity through the Six Nations and then the World Championship in Italy, while Wood also demonstrated impressive composure and a tidy skill set to eventually claim the number 10 jersey in the maelstrom of a difficult season for the squad. They are joined by secondrow Conor Kennelly, prop Emmet Calvey and centre Eoghan Smyth. Five of Leinster’s nine strong first-year intake played for the Irish 20s last season – centres Connor Fahy and Ciarán Mangan, wing Páidí Farrell, prop Alex Mullan and secondrow Mahon Ronan. Todd Lawlor would have but for injury. Six of the newbies are backs. There are 71 academy players in total across the four provinces, broken down to Leinster (20), Munster (18), Ulster (17) and Connacht (16), of which 27 are first years next season. Leinster and Ulster contracted more backs than forwards, while the reverse was the case for Munster and Connacht.

Title: Trump opens the door for crypto and private equity in your 401(k) plan

Time Published: 2025-08-07T23:48:01Z

Watch CBS News August 7, 2025 / 7:48 PM EDT / CBS/AP President Trump on Thursday signed an executive order that could allow millions of Americans saving for retirement through 401(k) accounts to invest in higher-risk private equity and cryptocurrency assets. The executive order doesn't immediately change how people will invest for retirement through their employer-sponsored accounts, as federal agencies would need to rewrite regulations to allow expanded investment choices. That's a process that experts say could take months, or longer, to complete. But once done, employers could offer a broader array of mutual funds and investments to workers, according to the White House. New plans could invest in alternative assets, particularly private equity, cryptocurrencies and real estate. The move comes as the 401(k) has become the primary vehicle for American workers to save for retirement, with most employers offering a menu of investment choices among major asset classes, such as stock-based mutual funds. The $5 trillion private equity industry, which makes investments into private businesses rather than publicly traded stocks, has for decades wanted to compete for a role in retirement plans. At the same time, the cryptocurrency industry, whose executives strongly supported Trump's 2024 campaign, has aimed for more mainstream acceptance among Americans. "It was inevitable that bitcoin would make its way into American 401(k)'s," said Cory Klippsten, the CEO of Swan Bitcoin. "As fiduciaries realize bitcoin's risk-adjusted upside over the long term, we'll see growing allocations, especially from younger, tech-savvy workers who want hard money, not melting ice cubes." The EO could give private equity and crypto firms long-sought access to a pool of funds worth trillions. Investment companies applauded Mr. Trump's executive order, with TIAA, which manages the retirement assets of teachers, professors and other academics, and investing giant BlackRock saying they support the measure for providing a broader number of investment strategies to workers. "We believe end investors can benefit from the advantages that private investments can offer when embedded within professionally managed vehicles like target date funds or through guaranteed annuity products," TIAA said in a statement emailed to CBS MoneyWatch. The president's order directs the Labor Department and other agencies to redefine what would be considered a qualified asset under 401(k) retirement rules. Americans' retirement plans are governed by a law known as the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, better known as ERISA. Employers are required by law to offer retirement options that are in the best interest of their employees, not Wall Street. Most retirement plans for Americans are made up of stock and bond investments, and to a much lesser extent, cash and heavily traded commodities such as gold. Even after the regulations are written, it will take time for the major retirement plan companies such as Fidelity, Vanguard, T. Rowe Price and others, to develop appropriate funds for employers to use. Employers are not likely to revise their retirement plan options quickly as well, so it may take several years before crypto and private equity investments are mainstream in an individual's retirement plan. The price of bitcoin was up 2% on Thursday to $116,542 and has nearly doubled since Trump was elected. Under Democratic President Joe Biden, federal regulators were to treat cryptocurrency investments with "extreme care" because of the extreme volatility of crypto. It is not uncommon for bitcoin, ethereum and other big cryptocurrencies to move up or down 10% in a single day, whereas a 2% or 3% single-day move in the stock market would be considered historic. For cryptocurrency companies, which donated millions to Trump's campaign as well as his inauguration, one goal was to get their industry qualified under ERISA. Coinbase, one of the largest crypto companies in the United States, was also a major donor toward Trump's military parade in Washington this summer. Under Trump, the Securities and Exchange Commission dropped its lawsuit against Coinbase, where the Biden administration said crypto should be treated as a security. Crypto is particularly popular among young Americans. While volatile, bitcoin has generally moved upward since it was created by an anonymous programmer nearly 20 years ago. Private equity firms rely heavily on high-net-worth individuals and state and private pension plans, which have extremely long investment timelines. But having access to Americans' retirement assets would open up a deep pool of cash. Blackstone CEO Steve Schwarzman has told investors going back to at least 2017 that it was a "dream" of his and the industry to be able to draw upon these retirement assets. Previous administrations, Republican and Democrat alike, had agreed that private equity investments, which can be riskier, more expensive and less liquid than traditional stock and bond market mutual funds, should not be included in 401(k) plans. © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

Title: JUST IN – Trump Executive Order To Expand 401(k) Investment Options, Including Crypto

Time Published: 2025-08-07T23:00:34Z

US President Donald Trump is preparing to sign an executive order this Thursday that could shake up how Americans invest for retirement. The move would allow 401(k) plans to include a wider range of assets — like private equity, real estate, and yes, even cryptocurrency. The order, as reported by Bloomberg News, tells the Labor Department to take another look at the current rules under ERISA — that’s the Employee Retirement Income Security Act — and figure out how to give retirement plan administrators more room to include less traditional, higher-risk investments. Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer has been tasked with working alongside the Treasury, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and other federal agencies to make this happen. The main goal? Give plan sponsors a clearer roadmap to offer more diverse investment options, without falling foul of the law. Donald Trump will sign an executive order that aims to allow private equity, real estate, cryptocurrency and other alternative assets in 401(k)s https://t.co/IXetIBnTzL — Bloomberg (@business) August 7, 2025 Right now, most of the $12 trillion sitting in 401(k)s is invested in good old-fashioned stocks and bonds. But with this new push, savers might soon get the option to invest in assets that were once out of reach. That said, it’s not as simple as just adding a few new buttons on a retirement dashboard. Offering private equity or crypto means plan administrators will have to show that they’ve done their homework — that the managers are qualified, the fees are fair, and that everything lines up with fiduciary standards. Supporters of the move argue that expanding into private markets could lead to better long-term returns, especially in times when public markets are lagging. Critics, however, worry about the downsides — like high fees, limited access to funds, and the risks that come with less liquid investments. Big players like Blackstone, Apollo, and KKR could benefit big-time from the change. In fact, BlackRock is already planning to roll out a new 401(k) fund with private investments in 2026. Empower Retirement is expected to launch similar offerings later this year. What really stands out in this executive order is its nod to crypto. It’s the latest in a series of moves that show Trump warming up to digital assets. Just this past summer, the White House hosted “Crypto Week,” discussed new rules for stablecoins, and even floated the idea of a national Bitcoin reserve. The new order reportedly asks the SEC to loosen restrictions that have kept crypto out of most retirement plans. If successful, this could open the door for Bitcoin, stablecoins, and other digital assets to become part of Americans’ retirement portfolios.

Title: Trump signs order opening way for alternative assets in 401(k)s

Skip to comments. Posted on 08/07/2025 3:19:37 PM PDT by JSM_Liberty U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Thursday that aims to allow private equity, real estate, cryptocurrency, and other alternative assets in 401(k) retirement accounts. The order smoothes the way for private equity and other fund managers to tap into trillions of dollars of Americans' retirement savings. It could open up a vast new funding source to managers of alternative assets outside of stocks, bonds, and cash, though critics say it also could bring too much risk into retirement investments. "The Securities and Exchange Commission must consider ways to facilitate access to alternative asset investments by participants in defined-contribution retirement plans," ... the White House said. It directs the Labor Secretary to consult with her counterparts at the Treasury Department, the SEC, and other federal regulators, and to "re-examine" previous guidance. Such a move could be a boon for big alternative asset managers such as Blackstone , KKR , and Apollo Global Management , by opening the $12-trillion market for retirement funds, known as defined contribution plans, to their investments. Some of those firms have already struck partnerships with asset managers who run those plans. The world's largest asset manager, BlackRock (BK.N) , plans to launch its own retirement fund that includes private equity and private credit assets next year. Proponents argue that younger savers can benefit from potentially higher returns on riskier investments in funds that get more conservative as they approach retirement. "On the asset manager side, it's a $12-trillion retirement market that they have previously not had access to. For them, there's certainly a lot of opportunity," said Morningstar analyst Jason Kephart.

Title: Trump opens 401(k)s to private equity. Here's how much to invest.

In the past, the private equity world has been largely populated by ultra-rich investors, endowments and pension funds. That is about to change. Retirement savers with 401(k) accounts are gaining access to the private investment market, which mostly pivots on privately held companies, rather than public ones. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, announced in June that it will offer a 401(k) target-date retirement fund that includes private investments, with a launch date in 2026. Another retirement giant, Empower, said in May that it will offer private investments in some workplace accounts later this year. Other retirement plan providers have made similar moves. And President Trump signed an executive order on Aug. 7 that calls for federal guidance on adding private investments and other "alternative assets" to 401(k) plans, effectively opening the door to those investments for retirement savers. "Alternative assets, such as private equity, real estate, and digital assets, offer competitive returns and diversification benefits," a new federal fact sheet states. "President Trump is expanding access to these assets to ensure a dignified and comfortable retirement for all Americans." Firms that invest in private assets are pushing to gain access to 401(k)s and other “defined-contribution” workplace retirement plans, a $12 trillion market. Private equity firms raise money to buy, manage and sell companies for profit. Investors are typically very wealthy individuals or institutions. The private credit marketplace loans money to companies or individuals outside the banking and fixed-income industries. Regular retirement savers haven’t had much access to private investments in the past. The minimum investment in a private equity fund might be in the millions, or at least the hundreds of thousands, according to Investopedia. Your money might be tied up for years. But there’s a reason wealthy investors and endowment managers like private equity funds. In recent decades, “They actually have done better than the stock market by 1 to 2 percentage points,” said Robert Brokamp, a senior adviser at The Motley Fool. Private equity yielded average annual returns of 10.5% from 2000 through 2020, Investopedia reports. Other estimates range higher. Private equity is considered a high-risk, high-return alternative to the stock market, which, of course, carries its own risks. “Why do wealthy people like it? Because it has the highest upside,” said Keith Singer, a certified financial planner in Boca Raton, Florida. Along with the upside comes a steep downside. Private companies face fewer regulations and reporting requirements than public ones. It can be hard to divine how much money a private company earns. “These are private companies, and with that comes less transparency,” Brokamp said. “That’s part of the reason people stay private: They don’t want to do all the regulatory filings that come with going public.” The number of public companies has dropped “by about half” since the mid-1990s, Brokamp said. Private companies tend to stay private longer and do public stock offerings later. Stocks carry risk, but a retirement saver who puts money in an S&P 500 index fund is “investing in some pretty well-established companies,” Brokamp said. Private equity, by contrast, often involves companies in distress. Bankruptcies run higher. “Private equity is riskier than public equity,” said Caleb Silver, editor in chief of Investopedia. “It’s more speculative in nature because you are investing in companies that, in some cases, have no proven track record.” Given the risk, Silver suggests an everyday retirement saver should not invest “more than 10% of your portfolio” in private investments: “It’s simply too risky.” Some of the emerging 401(k) offerings seem tailored to manage that risk. BlackRock, for example, plans to offer private investments within a broader target-date retirement fund. Target-date funds generally offer a mix of stocks, bonds and other investments, with the mix growing more conservative as you approach retirement. The new BlackRock fund would allocate only 5% to 20% of its holdings to private investments, with the quotient dropping as you age. Private equity tends to be illiquid: Investors generally see their money tied up for months or years. In a 401(k), by contrast, you can typically buy or sell investments daily. That should be less of a concern, though, when private equity sits in a target-date fund, which includes publicly traded investments that can be sold if an investor wants out. In 2020, the Trump Administration issued an “Information Letter” instructing that 401(k)-type retirement plans could invest in private equity without violating federal regulations. The law requires 401(k) managers to act in the best interest of investors, protecting them from large losses and excessive fees. The new executive order instructs federal agencies to make any regulatory changes necessary to allow for private investments and other alternative investments, including cryptocurrency. Some observers fear, however, that the risks of private investment may be too steep for everyday retirement savers. In June, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Massachusetts) penned a letter to the CEO of Empower about its plan to offer private investments in 401(k) accounts. “Given the sector’s weak investor protections, its lack of transparency, expensive management fees, and unsubstantiated claims of high returns, we are seeking information on how your company will ensure the safety of the billions of dollars of retirement savings it safeguards as it implements this program,” Warren wrote. Empower responded, in essence, that retirement savers deserve a crack at the lucrative private investment market, after decades of exclusion. “Empower believes in the democratization of private investing,” wrote Edmund F. Murphy III, the Empower CEO. Even so, leaders of the 401(k) industry will “feel more comfortable” about private investments if Congress approves legislation that explicitly allows it, said Thomas Gahan, managing director of Procyon Partners, a financial advisory firm in Shelton, Connecticut. Gahan spoke to USA TODAY before Trump signed the executive order. Gahan predicts more 401(k) providers will offer private investments as an option in the target-date funds, as BlackRock plans to do. “I think it’s a stepping stone,” he said. The 401k industry may eventually allow any retirement saver to invest in funds made up entirely of private investments, Gahan predicted earlier this year, but probably not without legislation that explicitly permits the investments – or an executive order from Trump. That order has now arrived. “This will happen over time,” he said, “not overnight.”

The race is already on for the latest addition to the Irish athletics medal rush, Precious Akpe-Moses putting herself into contention by making the 100 metres final on day one of the European Under-20 Championships. Akpe-Moses stormed through her heat and semi-final during Thursday’s opening sessions in Tampere, Finland improving her lifetime best to 11.62 seconds when nailing her automatic final spot by finishing second in her semi-final. The younger sister of Gina Apke-Moses, who won this 100m title at the European Under-20 100m title back in 2017, her semi-final time improved her previous best of 11.64 and she’ll go into Friday’s final ranked fourth fastest overall. Racing in the third of three semi-finals, Apke-Moses needed to make the top two to ensure qualification, and did exactly that – the athlete from Blackrock AC, in Louth, finishing second to Uliana Stepaniuk from Ukraine, who is still only 17, and who improved her best to 11.50 when winning. Conor Kelly went into his 400m heat the top ranked under-20 in Europe, his 45.85 clocked at the Morton Games last month the only sub-46 second entry. The Finn Valley AC athlete, who turned 18 last month, qualified with ease, winning his heat in 46.94 seconds, clearly keeping plenty in reserve. Sean Doggett, from Athenry AC, also finished second in his heat in 47.59 to secure automatic qualification for Friday’s semi-finals. Cormac Dixon is also the top-ranked athlete in the 3,000m, running 7:56.59 indoors in the US earlier this season, and the Tallaght AC athlete also cruised through, finishing fourth in his heat in 8:19.80 – that final set for Saturday’s evening session. Cian Crampton, from Edenderry AC, made it safely through to Saturday’s final of the discus, ranked fourth overall with his best throws of 57.94m to finish second in Group A. A big performance from Theo Hanlon (Suncroft AC) in the men’s shot put qualifiers also landed him in the final, with a best of 18.00m. There were a couple of near misses, Gemma Galvin, from Ennis Track AC, flailing just short of making the 1,500m final after running 4:25.06 to finish seventh in her heat. She ended up ranked 13th overall, with the top 12 progressing. Oisin Lynch, from Killarney Valley AC, also missed out on a place in the 800m final, running 1:50.88 to finish fifth in his heat, while Ethan Dewhirst (Tir Chonaill AC) was disqualified for a false start in his 400m hurdles heat. In the 50 years since John Treacy claimed Ireland’s first medal in these championships, winning bronze in the 5,000m in Athens in 1975, plenty of other successful names have followed in his footsteps, including Mark Carroll, Ciara Mageean, Sarah Lavin, Sarah Healy, Kate O’Connor and Rhasidat Adeleke. In the last month alone, Irish athletes have won 11 international medals, Kate O’Connor winning gold in the heptathlon at the World University Games, before Nicola Tuthill added silver in the hammer. Tuthill also won the silver medal at the European Under-23 Championships in Bergen, Norway, one of four Irish athletes to win medals there, along with Anika Thompson (gold in the 10,000m and bronze in the 5,000), Nick Griggs (silver in the 5,000m) and Eimear Maher (bronze in the 1,500m). At the European Youth Olympics in Skopje, North Macedonia last month, another four Irish athletes won medals: Erin Friel and Ben Sykes won bronze in the 400m and 100m respectively, before Ellis McHugh and Joe Burke also won bronze in the 400m hurdles and 200m respectively. Elsewhere, Sarah Lavin was back in action days after winning her 10th Irish title in the 100m hurdles, and took another impressive win at the Serbia Athletics Meeting in Belgrade, which is part of World Athletics Continental Tour Bronze series, clocking 12.90 seconds.

Title: Trump clears way for alternate assets like private equity, crypto in 401(k)s

President Trump signed an executive order Thursday allowing alternative assets like private equity, cryptocurrency and real estate in 401(k)s. The order directs the Labor Department to review guidance around private market investments in retirement plans subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. Trump’s directive smoothes the way for private equity and other fund managers to tap into trillions of dollars of Americans’ retirement savings. It could open up a vast new funding source to managers of alternative assets outside of stocks, bonds, and cash, though critics say it also could bring too much risk into retirement investments. “The order directs the Securities and Exchange Commission to facilitate access to alternative assets for participant-directed defined-contribution retirement savings plans by revising applicable regulations and guidance,” the White House official said on condition of anonymity. Such a move could be a boon for big alternative asset managers such as Blackstone, KKR and Apollo Global Management by opening the $12-trillion market for retirement funds, known as defined contribution plans, to their investments. Some of those firms have already struck partnerships with asset managers who run those plans. The world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock, plans to launch its own retirement fund that includes private equity and private credit assets next year. Stay up on the very latest with Evening Update. Please provide a valid email address. By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. Never miss a story. Empower, the second-largest retirement plan provider in the US, said it’s joining asset managers like Apollo to start allowing private assets in some accounts later this year. Bitcoin, the world’s top cryptocurrency, was aboout more than 2% to $116,819.60 shortly after Trump signed the order at around 3:50 p.m. ET. Trump ordered Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer to work with federal regulatory agencies like the Treasury Department and Securities and Exchange Department – the latter of which was asked to facilitate access to alternative assets. During Trump’s first term, the Labor Department issued fresh guidance allowing private market exposure in 401(k) plans. Since his return to the White House, officials have been weighing whether to ease some of the legal concerns that have long kept alternative assets out of retirement plans, which consist mostly of stocks and bonds. Allowing private assets in 401(k)s gives savers more investment options and could result in greater returns, proponents have argued. Critics contend these assets are risky and could leave retirement plan administrators vulnerable to lawsuits. The order follows Trump’s campaign pledge to make the US “the crypto capital” of the world. He recently signed into law the first piece of legislation regulating stablecoins pegged to the US dollar, and in March issued an executive order calling for the creation of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Trump’s White House includes venture capitalist David Sacks of San Francisco-based firm Craft Ventures, who serves as the first-ever AI and crypto czar. His administration has taken a friendlier approach to regulating the industry, dismissing and putting on pause lawsuits and probes that target crypto giants like Coinbase and Robinhood. The Trump family is involved in several crypto ventures of its own, including a sizable stake in crypto firm World Liberty Financial, investments in a bitcoin-mining company and Trump- and Melania-branded memecoins.

Title: 'Disaster in the Making': Trump to Open 401(k)s to Crypto, Private Equity Vultures

Quality journalism. Progressive values. Direct to your inbox. U.S. President Donald Trump signs an executive order in the Roosevelt Room of the White House on July 31, 2025. "Stuffing private equity, crypto, and other 'alternative assets' into 401(k)s is about propping up scams and bailing out an industry that's run out of buyers," said one critic. U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to sign an executive order on Thursday that would allow private equity and cryptocurrencies into Americans' 401(k)s, appeasing corporate interests that lobbied for the change and disregarding warnings about the risks it poses to retirement accounts. Citing an unnamed senior White House official, CNN reported that "the order calls for the Labor Department and Securities and Exchange Commission to issue guidance to employers about providing access to those alternative investments in their retirement accounts." The private equity industry has been working for years to gain access to a portion of the roughly $12 trillion that Americans have saved in workplace retirement plans. "This is the holy grail for private equity," Axios reported Thursday, noting that federal rules currently bar most defined-contribution plans from investing in private equity and crypto. Both industries spent big on the 2024 election; the investment management behemoth BlackRock, whose CEO has advocated opening 401(k)s to private equity, donated to Trump's inaugural committee. James Baratta and Whitney Curry Wimbish noted in The American Prospect earlier this year that "there was added desperation from the industry" for access to 401(k)s "because of their dire need for cash amid weakening performance and fewer deals." "Some firms have begun mortgaging their own funds for money to pay out limited partners," they added. "Retail investors represented trillions in untapped potential." "Private equity executives have enriched themselves by the billions, taking high fees and other charges from working people's hard-earned retirement savings in pension funds." Helaine Olen, managing editor at the American Economic Liberties Project and a longtime personal finance columnist, said in a statement Thursday that "stuffing private equity, crypto, and other 'alternative assets' into 401(k)s is about propping up scams and bailing out an industry that's run out of buyers—and it's being done at the expense of Americans' retirements everywhere." "There's a reason most employers didn't bite when Trump tried this the first time and why the private investments industry has put on such a thick lobbying campaign," said Olen. "These funds are high-fee, risky, and opaque. Private equity consistently underperforms the S&P 500. This is a windfall for billionaire fund managers and a disaster in the making for regular Americans trying to save for retirement." Last week, the Americans for Financial Reform Education Fund and American Federation of Teachers released a report warning that if private equity is given a foothold in 401(k)s, "millions of workers saving for retirement would be exposed to higher risks and steep fees in products that lack basic investor protections and transparency requirements." The report found that private equity profitability "has been in a year-over-year decline" for the past two decades and that "fee structures—paid directly by investors or indirectly through portfolio companies—are prone to extensive manipulation." Lisa Donner, co-executive director at Americans for Financial Reform Education Fund, said that "private equity executives have enriched themselves by the billions, taking high fees and other charges from working people's hard-earned retirement savings in pension funds." "Now they want fees from the trillions of dollars in individual retirement accounts," Donner added, "putting millions of more people at risk." U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to sign an executive order on Thursday that would allow private equity and cryptocurrencies into Americans' 401(k)s, appeasing corporate interests that lobbied for the change and disregarding warnings about the risks it poses to retirement accounts. Citing an unnamed senior White House official, CNN reported that "the order calls for the Labor Department and Securities and Exchange Commission to issue guidance to employers about providing access to those alternative investments in their retirement accounts." The private equity industry has been working for years to gain access to a portion of the roughly $12 trillion that Americans have saved in workplace retirement plans. "This is the holy grail for private equity," Axios reported Thursday, noting that federal rules currently bar most defined-contribution plans from investing in private equity and crypto. Both industries spent big on the 2024 election; the investment management behemoth BlackRock, whose CEO has advocated opening 401(k)s to private equity, donated to Trump's inaugural committee. James Baratta and Whitney Curry Wimbish noted in The American Prospect earlier this year that "there was added desperation from the industry" for access to 401(k)s "because of their dire need for cash amid weakening performance and fewer deals." "Some firms have begun mortgaging their own funds for money to pay out limited partners," they added. "Retail investors represented trillions in untapped potential." "Private equity executives have enriched themselves by the billions, taking high fees and other charges from working people's hard-earned retirement savings in pension funds." Helaine Olen, managing editor at the American Economic Liberties Project and a longtime personal finance columnist, said in a statement Thursday that "stuffing private equity, crypto, and other 'alternative assets' into 401(k)s is about propping up scams and bailing out an industry that's run out of buyers—and it's being done at the expense of Americans' retirements everywhere." "There's a reason most employers didn't bite when Trump tried this the first time and why the private investments industry has put on such a thick lobbying campaign," said Olen.

Title: Core Scientific’s largest active shareholder to oppose CoreWeave deal
URL: https://blockspace.media/insight/core-scientifics-largest-active-shareholder-announces-opposition-to-coreweave-deal/
Time Published: 2025-08-07T18:13:15Z
Full Content:
The largest active shareholder in Core Scientific (NASDAQ: CORZ), Two Seas Capital, will vote no on its pending acquisition by AI neocloud provider CoreWeave (NASDAQ: CRWV), according to a press release from investment manager Two Seas Capital. The firm said that the acquisition terms—an un-collared, all-stock exchange—leaves Core Scientific investors exposed to CoreWeave share-price volatility without price protection. Enjoying the read? Get our newsletter directly to your inbox on all things Bitcoin-equities by clicking here. Two Seas said the consideration “materially undervalues” Core Scientific and “unnecessarily” shifts economic risk to its existing shareholders. It cited the roughly 30% decline in Core Scientific’s share price in the days after the July announcement as evidence of broader investor concern. Two Seas Capital claims to own 6.3% of Core Scientific’s outstanding stock. While Vanguard and Blackrock are the largest shareholders in Core Scientific with 9.14% and 7.8% stakes, respectively, these institutions are considered passive investors since they hold CORZ shares for certain indices. Conversely, Two Seas is considered an active investor because it is actively trading shares of CORZ and intends to vote with these shares. As of the end of Q1-2025, Two Seas reported roughly 2.7% ownership of Core Scientific; if the company does own 6.3% now as it claims, it must file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) within 10 days of increasing its holdings to conform with the SEC’s 5% beneficial ownership reporting threshold. Notably, Two Seas Capital also owns CoreWeave shares, and while its supports the strategic decision to combine the two datacenter operators, it said the current terms favor CoreWeave “decidedly and unfairly.” “Core Scientific – with its significant scale, ready access to low-cost power, and data center talent – is uniquely positioned to meet this growing demand and has a clear runway to compound growth for many years,” the firm said in a statement. Two Seas Capital intends to solicit other Core Scientific shareholders to reject the transaction and will lodge a definitive proxy statement with the SEC ahead of the company’s special meeting. The investment manager will distribute proxy materials once filed. As of 6 August 2025, Two Seas Capital and affiliated funds also owned 77,038 CoreWeave class A shares and held an indirect economic interest in 395,124 additional CoreWeave shares through a private investment vehicle. The group disclosed long call options on 5,722,300 Core Scientific shares and short call options on 1,700,000 shares, along with cash-settled swaps referencing 500,000 shares. If the current agreement is not amended to address valuation and structural issues, Two Seas said it is prepared to vote its stake against the deal and encourage other investors to do the same. The firm added that it would accept bids from CoreWeave or other parties, provided the consideration reflects Core Scientific’s strategic value.

Title: Oligarch’s Heirs Reveal US Fund Bets in Family Office Revamp
URL: https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/oligarchs-heirs-reveal-us-fund-bets-in-family-office-revamp-11754586151197.html
Time Published: 2025-08-07T17:02:30Z
Full Content:
Badri Patarkatsishvili’s family set up a firm to manage his multibillion-dollar fortune after the mustachioed Georgian tycoon died suddenly at his English mansion in 2008. As his heirs fended off opportunists seeking a slice of the billionaire’s assets, the money manager kept a low profile, offering few details of how it handled the wealth he amassed alongside fellow oligarchs Boris Berezovsky and Roman Abramovich following the collapse of the Soviet Union. That’s starting to change. The Patarkatsishvilis’ family office, Bili Capital, has revealed more than two dozen bets on funds from some of the biggest names in global finance, including BlackRock Inc. and Ares Management Corp., on a recently launched website. Patarkatsishvili’s 70-year-old widow, Inna, the de facto head of the family after his death, also ceded her stake in the firm within the past year, registry filings show. That move coincides with the resolution of a long-running legal battle over the fortune of Georgia’s one-time richest man, and has separately led to Inna’s son-in-law, Yevhen Hunyak, 51, becoming Bili Capital’s only shareholder. As a result, a second-generation member is now in sole control of one of London’s biggest — and historically most discreet — family offices for the first time. A representative for the Patarkatsishvili dynasty, who describe Bili Capital as a multi-generational family office overseeing more than $1 billion in assets, didn’t respond to requests for comment. The disclosures give rare insight into one of the biggest fortunes to emerge from Russia’s so-called “wild ‘90s” as the country transitioned from communism to a market-based economy. They also make the once-secretive Bili Capital more transparent than many other family offices, whose public profiles often comprise a single-page website with little information. At least one-fifth of individuals among the world’s 500 biggest fortunes now have a family office that help to oversee wealth totaling more than $4 trillion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Bili Capital’s “transparency on what they’re doing makes them much more accessible, and relatable, to the outside world,” said David Hawkins, founder of Cliveden Advisory, a strategic consulting and reputation-management firm for ultra-wealthy individuals. “They likely want to do more deals.” Bili Capital’s other fund allocations include Silicon Valley venture capital giant Andreessen Horowitz, index-fund pioneer Vanguard and Mubadala-backed Fortress Investment Group. It also oversees direct stakes in a Georgia theme park, a mineral-water company and a real estate developer serving Miami’s Fisher Island enclave for the ultra-wealthy. ‘The Muscle’ Patarkatsishvili began to build his fortune in the early 1990s when he teamed up with Berezovsky, one of the most influential oligarchs of that decade, to run car dealership LogoVaz. The pair later partnered with Abramovich to help establish Russian oil giant Sibneft out of state-owned assets, with Berezovsky leveraging his Kremlin connections and Patarkatsishvili keeping business relations running smoothly behind the scenes. “Berezovsky was the public face of their alliance, while Badri was the muscle,” said David Lingelbach, who headed Bank of America Corp.’s Russian operations during the 1990s and is now a professor of entrepreneurship at the University of Baltimore. “He’s such an interesting oligarch as everything about him was so opaque. He was one of the most powerful — if not the most powerful – person in Georgia.” In 2001, Abramovich acquired the Sibneft stakes owned by Patarkatsishvili and Berezovsky for more than $1 billion after their relationship with the Kremlin soured. Berezovsky later tried unsuccessfully to sue Abramovich over that deal in one of London’s most high-profile legal battles, before he was found dead at his own English mansion in 2013. Abramovich is worth $7.8 billion today, according to Bloomberg’s wealth index. Bili Capital’s revamp comes after years of battles over the patriarch’s assets have receded, freeing his heirs to focus on what’s left of the fortune. Since his death, the family has been entangled in several cases, including a $3 billion claim in 2008 by Berezovsky, who alleged that a portion of his former business partner’s holdings — often stashed in secretive tax havens — rightfully belonged to him. Berezovsky withdrew his claim four years later, while the family also successfully fended off a distant relative positioning themselves as Patarkatsishvili’s heir. Another case dating to 2016 wrapped up this year at the UK’s highest court. By some estimates, the family has recovered at least $2 billion of Patarkatsishvili’s assets, though that’s just a fraction of what his overall wealth was believed to be at the time of his death. Branding Strategy Founded in December 2008, Bili Capital is led by Chief Executive Officer Sergey Ershikov and Chief Financial Officer Ilia Demidov, who both previously worked at Russian lender Alfa-Bank. Like other family offices, the closely held firm isn’t regulated as it doesn’t manage money for external investors, limiting transparency requirements. Allocating to funds instead of striking deals under its own name also allows it to keep a low profile, while its longtime holding entity is in Jersey, a low-tax territory neighboring the UK that offers exemptions from publicly disclosing consolidated accounts. A 2022 job posting for Bili Capital cited further assets including a yacht, a fleet of vehicles and several European homes, underscoring how the firm caters to both the financial affairs and jet-setting lifestyle of its owners. The online post also described the firm developing a “branding” strategy, signaling how it has been considering its public image for years. “Reputational capital is important,” said Hawkins, who also advises family offices. “It’s a necessary form of insurance.” In a section entitled “Meet our family,” Bili Capital’s website features a black-and-white image of Inna accompanied in a countryside setting by her two daughters: Liana, 45, the founder of an arts production company, and Iya, 42, a human rights activist. Iya’s husband Hunyak, the co-founder of a private children’s dental group and Bili Capital’s sole shareholder since September, stands to the right of the three women with a small gap between them. The group are all smiling, with no trace of their past traumas. ©2025 Bloomberg L.P. This article was generated from an automated news agency feed without modifications to text.

These technologies are being used to decode complex brain signals with high accuracy, enhance real-time processing, and personalize user experiences. AI algorithms can learn from user patterns and adapt to individual neural signatures, improving both the effectiveness and responsiveness of BCI systems. ML techniques are also essential in managing large volumes of EEG data, filtering out noise, and identifying meaningful neural activity. This capability is particularly useful in dynamic environments where traditional signal processing methods fall short. Furthermore, AI-powered BCIs are enabling new applications such as emotion detection, cognitive state monitoring, and adaptive learning systems. As AI technologies mature and become more accessible, their integration with BCI platforms is expected to drive substantial innovation, making interfaces more intelligent, efficient, and intuitive for end users across multiple verticals. 7. Regulatory Support and Ethical Frameworks Enhancing Adoption The global regulatory landscape for BCIs is evolving to support innovation while ensuring user safety and privacy. Regulatory agencies such as the FDA in the United States and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) are increasingly focused on providing clear pathways for BCI device approval. Guidelines for clinical trials, patient data security, and ethical deployment are being strengthened, which is instilling confidence among investors, developers, and end users. Moreover, growing public discourse around the ethical implications of BCIs—such as consent, mental privacy, and data ownership—is prompting the creation of standardized frameworks and best practices. Governments are also funding initiatives aimed at developing secure, inclusive, and responsible BCI solutions. This supportive regulatory and ethical ecosystem is facilitating faster market entry, encouraging transparency, and building trust among consumers and stakeholders. As compliance improves and standardized frameworks are adopted globally, it will further catalyze the growth and acceptance of BCI technologies. 8. Market Challenges: High Costs and Technical Complexities Despite its promising outlook, the BCI market faces several challenges that could hinder its widespread adoption. High development and deployment costs remain a significant barrier, especially for smaller companies and institutions in developing regions. Additionally, BCI systems require precise calibration and ongoing maintenance, which can complicate usability and scalability. Technical hurdles such as signal interference, low bandwidth, and inconsistent neural responses also affect system reliability. For invasive BCIs, the risks associated with surgical implantation, including infection and device failure, further restrict their use to specific medical cases. Moreover, the lack of trained professionals and standardized training protocols creates an additional bottleneck in clinical and research settings. Overcoming these challenges will require continued innovation, policy support, and education initiatives to democratize access and build user confidence. Addressing these issues head-on is critical for unlocking the full potential of BCI technologies across sectors and geographies. Geographic Dominance: North America currently holds the largest share of the Brain Computer Interface (BCI) market, driven by its advanced healthcare infrastructure, strong presence of leading tech companies, and significant investments in neurotechnology research. The United States, in particular, is at the forefront due to the early adoption of innovative medical devices, active government funding, and ongoing clinical trials involving BCI applications in rehabilitation and cognitive enhancement. Europe follows closely, with countries like Germany and the UK investing in brain research and digital health initiatives. Meanwhile, the Asia-Pacific region is emerging as a high-growth market, led by countries such as China, Japan, and South Korea. These nations are increasing funding for neuroscience, developing local BCI startups, and supporting digital transformation in healthcare and education. As demand for assistive technologies and smart user interfaces rises globally, regional markets are expected to contribute significantly to the industry's long-term growth and global reach.

Title: Questioning the Corporation

Full Content:
Yves here. It’s frustrating to see a piece that presents itself as well researched get information important to its argument wrong. I still recommend the article below by John Ruehl because it provides a detailed discussion of the growth and development of the corporate form, going back to precursors in the Roman Republic. However, when he gets to the modern era, he makes some glaring error which ironically undermine his effort to depict modern large corporations as dangerously unaccountable to the public’s interest. First, Ruehl perpetuates the canard that corporations exist to serve shareholders, citing a too-often invoked Michigan ruling. In fact, shareholders are residual claimants. All others from the supplier to employees to the landlord to the taxman come ahead. We’ve debunked this idea long form many times. Hoisting from a 2014 post: One of my pet peeves is the degree to which the notion that corporations exist only to serve the interests of shareholders is accepted as dogma and recited uncritically by the business press. I’m old enough to remember when that was idea would have been considered extreme and reckless. Corporations are a legal structure and are subject to a number of government and contractual obligations and financial claims. Equity holders are the lowest level of financial claim. It’s one thing to make sure they are not cheated, misled, or abused, but quite another to take the position that the last should be first. As we wrote last year: If you review any of the numerous guides prepared for directors of corporations prepared by law firms and other experts, you won’t find a stipulation for them to maximize shareholder value on the list of things they are supposed to do. It’s not a legal requirement. And there is a good reason for that. Directors and officers, broadly speaking, have a duty of care and duty of loyalty to the corporation. From that flow more specific obligations under Federal and state law. But notice: those responsibilities are to the corporation, not to shareholders in particular…Shareholders are at the very back of the line. They get their piece only after everyone else is satisfied. If you read between the lines of the duties of directors and officers, the implicit “don’t go bankrupt” duty clearly trumps concerns about shareholders… So how did this “the last shall come first” thinking become established? You can blame it all on economists, specifically Harvard Business School’s Michael Jensen. In other words, this idea did not come out of legal analysis, changes in regulation, or court decisions. It was simply an academic theory that went mainstream. And to add insult to injury, the version of the Jensen formula that became popular was its worst possible embodiment. One good source for the fact that economists, rather than legal decisions, were the basis for the acceptance of this idea, is a 2005 article by Frank Dobbin and Dirk Zorn, “Corporate Malfeasance and the Myth of Shareholder Value.” This paper looked back to the 1970s, the era of diversified and often underperforming firms (remember the conglomerate discount?). Deregulation, high inflation, and a lax attitude towards anti-trust enforcment stoked a hostile takeover boom. Economists celebrated this development as disciplining chief executives and moving assets into the hands of managers who could operate them more productively. In reality, the success of these early deals depended mainly on asset sales, both of non-core operations and of hidden sources of value, like corporate real estate, as well as leverage and slashing bloated head office staffs (the across-the-company headcount efforts became more prominent in the 1990s). Later in that post, we describe the seminal role of an internally inconsistent New York Times op-ed in 1970 in starting this ideological ball rolling. Another serious sour note is when Ruehl depicts the like of BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard as wielding enormous influence with corporations. Earth to base, they don’t. These huge shareholders are indexers. Their business in index replication at the lowest cost. They don’t sell shares because they don’t like how a company is run. They might lighten up because its price falls and so it represents a smaller amount of the index. On top of that, all of these giant fund managers compete for the lucrative 401 (k) business of public companies. Think they are going to sabotage getting those mandates by pressuring the C-Suite? Even for active manager, this idea of investor influence was eviscerated in Amar Bhide’s classic Harvard Business Review article, Efficient Markets, Deficient Governance. Aside from a small cohort of activist fund managers (aka greenmmail artists), even a big fund manager will not hold a large enough position of a public company to make it worth the bother to get them to shape up. It’s easier to sell a stock whose management is doing things you don’t like. One proof of the impotence of big shareholders: In 2009, investors got wind of Goldman’s intent to pay staff big bonuses. They were opposed, seeing it as a slap in the face to taxpayers who’d bailed them out. A group visited CEO LLoyd Blankfein to tell him they strongly opposed the plan. Blankfein went ahead anyhow. So the real scandal here is not investor influence. It’s an agency problem, that top executives control corporate assets and influence the fate of employees and communities, yet for the most part are accountable only to themselves. By John P. Ruehl, an Australian-American journalist living in Washington, D.C., and a world affairs correspondent for the Independent Media Institute. He is a contributor to several foreign affairs publications, and his book, Budget Superpower: How Russia Challenges the West With an Economy Smaller Than Texas’, was published in December 2022. Produced by Economy for All, a project of the Independent Media Institute Home to almost 70 percent of Fortune 500 companies, Delaware’s reputation as America’s “corporate capital” has faced challenges in recent years. Tesla’s and SpaceX’s high-profile exits to Texas in 2024highlighted other cracks in Delaware’s seamless relationship with large corporations, compounded by other states jockeying to attract businesses. Delaware’s government has launched a legislative charm offensive in response, passing several amendments in March 2025, which have eased restrictions on insider deals and reinforced the state’s commitments to low taxes and a business-friendly legal framework. Corporations can be created in minutes almost anywhere, yet all share a core identity as legal entities with rights and responsibilities. Over time, they have replaced religious institutions and political parties as the most powerful actors in society, largely shaping what we consume, how we work, and influencing behavior and social norms. Their modern form traces back to 17th-century charters, with roots in Roman law. Though often tools of the state, global corporations have proven capable of operating across borders and legal systems, developing unprecedented sovereignty and power. The benefits of corporations, including lower prices from scale, capital-driven innovation and efficiency, and global reach, have been undermined by the relentless accumulation of financial assets, particularly in the West. Short-term gains often supersede long-term value and sustainability, and despite stronger regulation on paper, modern corporations operate with greater independence from the state and increasingly avoid public accountability. The basic model behind them remains intact, with core legal principles like limited liability and separate legal personality, stemming from early corporate charters from the 1600s and fully developed by the 1800s, still forming the corporate foundation despite enormous growth in their scale and influence. Over the years, calls for democratic renewal and institutional imagination have been mounting, pointing to a long-overdue rethinking of corporate power. Building up to and Defining the Corporation Before modern corporations, societies around the world developed institutions to pool capital and dilute risk for trade, construction, and investment. In the Roman Republic, societas publicanorum had transferable shares (partes), professional managers, and central offices, and bid on state contracts for tax collection and infrastructure. However, Roman law allowed any partner to dissolve the business at will, limiting their longevity, and these types of partnerships faded under the empire’s centralized bureaucracy. After 313 CE, following the Edict of Milan, which legalized Christianity, the Catholic Church gained legal standing that helped it become one of Europe’s first enduring corporate-like entities. By the eighth century, European monarchs began issuing charters that bestowed privileges to monasteries, universities, towns, and tax collection, while guilds of merchants and artisans also emerged in the 11th century. This century also saw the emergence of the commenda in Italy, which allowed passive investors to fund merchant voyages for a share of the profits, an early form of limited liability that spread across Europe. Family banking dynasties from Florence emerged in the 14th and 15th centuries, building pan-European financial networks and eventually expanding to other industries like mining and manufacturing. Similar models developed globally. The commenda is believed to be inspired by Islamic qiradpartnerships that began in the sixth century, where one party provided the capital and the other conducted trade. Beginning in the 1600s, large family firms in China thrived with imperial support. Maritime guilds thrived in Southeast Asian port cities like Majapahit and Srivijaya. Still, it was in Europe, where Roman and Canon Law fused, that legal innovation evolved most dramatically and took on the modern corporate form by the 17th century. Before the rise of modern corporations, most businesses were family-run shops, temporary partnerships, or informal arrangements that lacked legal separation from their owners. What earlier institutions lacked was the five features defining the modern corporation; representation allowing designated agents to act on behalf of the firm without binding investors; entity-shielding protecting corporate assets from the debts of investors; capital lock-in preventing investors from pulling funds or forcing liquidation; transferable shares letting investors exit without disrupting operations; and limited liability ensuring investors aren’t personally responsible for corporate debts. The most foundational corporate characteristic is a legal personality, the ability to exist separately from its owners, with its own rights and responsibilities. From the Latin corpus (“body”), this concept lends context to former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney’s controversial 2011 remark that “corporations are people.” These features enable corporations to attract capital, own property, sign contracts, and avoid dissolution with membership changes. They vary widely from public to private, with tradable or restricted shares, and can be state-owned, profit-driven, or mission-based. But nearly all corporations share these core traits, which have been used by some to build the most flexible, powerful, and enduring institutions ever created. The Dutch and British East India Trading Companies The Dutch East India Company (VOC), founded in 1602, is widely considered the first modern multinational corporation. Though joint-stock ventures had existed earlier (mostly as short-term partnerships for single voyages), the VOC stood apart by introducing permanent capital, tradable shares, and a form of limited liability, attracting strong investment. As maritime trade and colonialism expanded over the previous century, long-term capital was increasingly required for risky, lucrative ventures in spices, textiles, and tea. The VOC met this demand by locking in investment, limiting shareholder exposure, and providing an orderly way to exit. Backed by the Dutch state, it merged competing firms into a single entity with centralized management, enabling it to scale up with unprecedented freedom. Dutch political institutions also played a role in the VOC’s power. As a new republic, the Netherlands offered investors protection from royal interference. Unlike other European countries where royal families funded and closely monitored colonial expeditions, the VOC operated with more autonomy. It received a perpetual charter and became the first company listed on a stock exchange, and was empowered to sign treaties, raise armies, and wage war, all while shielding shareholders from personal accountability. Despite collapsing in 1799 due to debt and corruption, it pioneered a corporate form unlike anything before. Two years before the VOC’s founding, its counterpart, the English East India Company (EIC), was formed in 1600. The EIC didn’t obtain permanent capital until 1657 and was slower to adopt liquidity. But the English Civil War curbed royal power after 1657, allowing it to evolve in ways that mirrored the VOC. The Bank of England, founded as a corporation in 1694, helped stabilize credit lines and made it easier for the EIC and other corporations to raise capital. The EIC eventually came to colonize and rule large parts of India, establishing a civil service and even clashing militarily with the VOC. Yet its power drew intense scrutiny. Following the Bengal Famine of 1770, the English parliament passed the Regulating Act of 1773 and Pitt’s India Act of 1784, curbing the EIC’s powers. The company was finally dissolved in 1874. “In 1857, the Indians rose in revolt against high-handed and oppressive Company rule… The Company lost all its administrative powers following the Government of India Act of 1858, and its Indian possessions and armed forces were taken over by the Crown. … The East India Company itself was formally dissolved by Act of Parliament in 1874,” according to the UK Parliament website. Though the VOC’s model was emulated by the EIC and influenced commercial ventures elsewhere in Europe, such corporations remained a form of special incorporation granted by state charter, not open to anyone. This exclusivity began to loosen over time, but the South Sea Bubble crash of 1720, seen as the first major financial crash, triggered fears of economic instability and unchecked corporate power. In response, governments reimposed strict controls, requiring corporations to obtain specific approval and follow stringent guidelines. Corporations proved essential during Britain’s industrial revolution, which began in the late 1700s. To support economic growth, parliament introduced reforms: the Joint Stock Companies Regulation and Registration Act of 1844 allowed businesses to register without special legislation, while the Limited Liability Act of 1855 extended legal protections to shareholders. These reforms, combined with Britain’s access to capital markets and imperial power, kick-started rapid corporate expansion in Europe. Arriving late to maritime trade, the Dutch and English drove corporate innovation to keep up with other European powers. Politicians supported corporate growth, benefiting from lucrative shares in the monopolies they helped create. But the VOC and EIC demonstrated the promise and peril of corporations. They could generate wealth and wield power beyond what states alone could achieve, but they also bred corruption and posed political threats. European leaders, therefore, aimed to harness the benefits of corporations while limiting their power by closely tying them to government control. The United States and the Modern Corporate Form Early British joint-stock companies like the Virginia Company planted the first corporate seeds in North America in the early 17th century. But while European models like the VOC and EIC inspired early colonial enterprises, the corporate form developed more slowly in the U.S. after independence, in both scale and structure. Shaped by a deep-rooted “distrust” of monopolies and state-chartered privilege, and wary of corporations as instruments of elite power and financial instability, many Americans didn’t trust companies that had special deals with the government. Instead, they preferred smaller, more personal business models like family-run shops, partnerships between a few people, or joint-stock ventures where people pooled money but didn’t have the legal structure of modern corporations that offered them protections. The early U.S. enterprises also lacked strong, centralized authority and consistent legal protections, especially for property and contracts, and many investors in states like Florida, Texas, and California avoided corporate structures until they were included in the U.S. Constitution. Yet this decentralized system ultimately gave corporations room to grow. Without strong federal control, states competed to attract businesses by loosening incorporation requirements. New York led with the first general incorporation law for manufacturers in 1811, with other states soon following and expanding the scope of the law. The vast, unexploited North American landmass and push for industrialization made the corporate structure increasingly attractive, further aided by America’s quicker and widespread adoption of limited liability and lighter state oversight compared to Europe. While state legislatures tried to regulate corporations with rules on capitalization, voting rights, and director terms, these measures proved mostly ineffective. Corporations amassed enormous influence, with “company towns” illustrating their growing control over local economies and governance. Corporate imperialism returned under an American banner, with the United Fruit Company, which controlled enormous banana plantations in Central America and used its political influence to overthrow governments. These towns still exist in some shape or form today. “The original coal and textile towns in America are now largely ghostly, but places like Hershey and Corning, New York, which were invigorated by the Corning glass company, are still going strong. Plus, as the LA Times writes, businesses such as Google and Facebook today are providing housing, amenities, and transportation for their workers—meaning that while we think of company towns in sepia tones, they’re also in digital blue,” statesSmithsonian magazine. In The Visible Hand, Alfred D. Chandler Jr. suggests that the dominance of American corporations by the 20th century was due to their managerial hierarchies rather than entrepreneurs, which provided them with stability, coordination, and centralized planning. This is partly supported in The Company: A Short History of a Revolutionary Idea, which argues that robber barons were replaced by “the faceless manager” and the multidivisional firm. By the 1930s, legal scholar Adolf A. Berle and economist Gardiner C. Means, whose work shaped modern corporate governance theory, warned that dispersed shareholders had lost control to entrenched managers and called for reforms in corporate oversight. The 1919 Dodge v. Ford case had already enshrined shareholder primacy in U.S. law, declaring that directors must prioritize shareholder profits. But rather than democratizing ownership, the rise of institutional investors, like pension and mutual funds, and other financial giants, further concentrated power among select shareholders. By the end of the 20th century, globalization offered American corporations, as well as others, a platform to dominate beyond natural borders. The American corporate model became the ruling template in a worldwide ecosystem, largely controlled by shareholder interests and executive compensation tied to quarterly earnings pressures. The Growing Power of Corporations Over time, corporations have become the dominant business entities. Despite only representing 18 percent of U.S. businesses, corporations generate nearly 82 percent of all revenues. Around 20,000 large corporations employ as many people as the 31.7 million small businesses, according to the 2024 data provided by payment processor company Clearly Payments. Many of them now function as monopolies or organized cartels. In the 2010 Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission case, the Supreme Court affirmed that corporations have First Amendment rights, including the right to “use money amassed from the economic marketplace to fund their speech.” Borderless by design, major corporations drive a race to the bottom for cheap international labor and pass sustainability costs onto consumers. Countries often lack the strength to rein them in, and where they can, corporations simply exploit tax havens and flexible jurisdictions. As economist Lynn A. Stout observed, outdated yet profitable business practices like shareholder primacy are hard to shake. Accountability and sustainability appear largely ignored, with corporations long prioritizing profit over public safety. Asbestos manufacturers suppressed evidence of its deadly health effects to keep selling their products. Tobacco firms knowingly misled the public about cancer risks for decades.Purdue Pharma, owned by the Sackler family, used its LLC status and shell corporations to dodge accountability for the opioid crisis. According to an Associated Press investigation, “the Sacklers’ wealth is shielded in a web of companies and trusts, some registered in offshore tax havens far from Purdue’s Connecticut headquarters,” states a 2019 article by CBS News. Calls for corporate responsibility have grown as the power of corporations has increased. The corporate social responsibility movement began with philanthropy in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and resurged in the 1970s. Beginning in the mid-2000s, ESG and stakeholder activism sought to revive this initiative, but became politicized and have waned, even as corporate influence continues to grow. As “universal owners” of the economy, institutional investors like BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street control vast shares and command corporate influence. While it was hoped their broad holdings would make them stewards of the economy, short-term thinking and weak oversight continue to limit meaningful action like prioritizing long-term sustainability, fair labor practices, and avoiding hoarding wealth. Corporations are wielding new tools of dominance through AI and digital technologies. “Companies such as Walmart, Tyson Foods, Koch Industries, Maersk, Siemens, and Unilever are using AI tools to swiftly find and engage with alternative suppliers during unexpected disruptions. They are also employing AI tools to pre-qualify suppliers ahead of time. These AI tools provide buyers with enhanced information that allows them to beat their competitors in securing alternate sources of supplies,” points out a Harvard Business Review 2023 article. They can also deflect accountability through PR campaigns, obscure controversies through complex supply chains and legal structures, and offload responsibility to subsidiaries, contractors, or consumers. Combined with the growing use of private military and security contractors, some modern corporations operating in unstable or contested regions are regaining a degree of coercive power reminiscent of the colonial-era trading giants. The core problem is that while we retain some voice in the political system, that influence doesn’t extend to massive corporate structures. “Voting with our wallets” offers little power when essential services are dominated by a handful of interconnected firms. Reform While the corporate model dominates, alternatives continue to evolve. In early 20th-century China, corporate law was weakly enforced, and corporations were uncommon. Today, China exerts control over both state-owned and private corporations, embedding Chinese Communist Party officials into corporate governance. This hybrid model places corporate activity under tighter oversight, supported in part by nationwide social credit scores for all companies. President Teddy Roosevelt promoted trust-busting as the solution to corporate abuse by big business, but as economist Lawrence Mitchell notes, the prior era of fierce competition among smaller companies was also disastrous. He identified the real problem of states competing for corporate charters in a “race to the bottom,” a danger that Justice Louis Brandeis also noted in 1933. Roosevelt even acknowledged in 1902 that only the federal government could properly regulate interstate corporations, which Mitchell supports. So, how should governments regulate monopolies? Some countries have taken a more open approach to consolidation. The German government, for example, legalized collusion and cartel formation to control prices and output in ways that serve national interests, actively encouraging the attempted merger of Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank since 2019. Cooperatives offer another path. The first successful cooperative, the Rochdale Society of Equitable Pioneers, was founded in 1844 in the UK, championing democratic control, open membership, and profit-sharing. In Spain, the Mondragon Corporation, a federation of worker-owned cooperatives founded in 1956, has become the “leading business project in the Basque Country and one of the largest corporations in Spain.” Rather than lay off workers, Mondragon often reallocates them across its network. New reformist approaches are also emerging in Europe. France’s 2019 PACTE Act allows companies to define a social purpose beyond profit, embedding missions into corporate charters and expanding employee influence in mergers and executive oversight. Economist Mariana Mazzucato has promoted this mission-driven model as part of her vision for innovation-led governance. In the U.S., Delaware’s recent legislative push is part of a broader effort challenging shareholder primacy, notably since the 2019 Business Roundtable, where top CEOs pledged to serve all stakeholders. Delaware and other American states already allow businesses to register as benefit corporations (B-corps), balancing profits with goals like environmental protection or community development. Existing corporations can convert by amending their founding documents. CHS Inc., a major agricultural cooperative ranked 115th on the Forbes 500 list in 2025, meanwhile, demonstrates how cooperative principles still have traction in the country. It has emerged as one of the “largest farmer-owned cooperatives in the world.” Digital finance is also leading to experimentation in how businesses are owned and operated. Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), for example, are blockchain-based communities with decentralized governance that make decisions by vote. Aiming for transparency and shared control, they face clear hurdles. Unclear legal status has slowed adoption, while security flaws, including a major 2016 breach, have seen millions stolen due to a code exploit. Governance challengesinclude low participation, power centralization, and slow decision-making. “In some high-profile DAOs, the majority of governance tokens are often held by the founders and early investors, which can skew decision outcomes in favor of their interests rather than the broader community,” states a blog by Colony, a platform providing a framework for DAOs. Not all innovation prioritizes the public good. The “Network State” concept, coined by tech entrepreneur Balaji Srinivasan, envisions venture-backed private cities, colonies, and zones across the U.S., Latin America, Africa, and beyond. These digital-first enclaves aim for diplomatic recognition and eventual sovereignty through special economic zones, framing private microstates as expressions of libertarian freedom. Efforts to reduce shareholder power can also backfire by merely concentrating power in the hands of corporate managers rather than all stakeholders. Elon Musk is a clear example; by retaining large ownership stakes, employing dual-class shares, and keeping firms like X, Tesla, and SpaceX private or under holding structures, he has shielded himself from shareholder influence while consolidating control. The planned incorporation of Starbase, Texas, a township effectively governed by SpaceX, demonstrates how this management style can dovetail with Network State ambitions. Born in the Dutch Republic, matured in England, and transformed by the United States, the march of the modern corporation has proven remarkably resilient over the centuries. Hudson’s Bay Company, founded in 1670 as an English trading giant like the EIC, once controlled vast swaths of North America and now exists as a retail chain. Corporate power in general, however, continues to expand. After early overreach by the VOC and EIC prompted containment efforts, corporations have resurged through globalization, financialization, and advances in technology. Short-term profit maximization is seen as natural, with structures geared away from wider stakeholder responsibility. Many firms resist direct governance to escape the negative optics of being seen as too powerful, which would bring more scrutiny and accountability. Yet some corporations have grown so large that they have become pillars of modern society and carry significant responsibility, even if they do not openly acknowledge it. Without altering their growing influence, the future will be shaped less by democratic will through established channels and more by concentrated, private authority. ‘So, how should governments regulate monopolies?’ I’m sure that the Chinese have a few good ideas. If any of their billionaires get out of line and start muscling in on the government (cough*Jack Ma*cough), they tend to go missing. Sometimes they turn back up again. Sometimes they don’t. In reading this article, I was struck how he insisted that corporations must aim for ‘longevity’. But in one of John Michael Greer’s novels – “Retrotopia” – he mentioned that it was not always so. That for example a corporation might be set up to build a road, it would raise the funds needed, it would then use those funds to have the road built, set aside money for maintenance, and would then dissolve itself after having completed the purpose that it was set up for. That sounded so strange the first time I read that. Some of it may depend on the type of corporation. A couple of examples from the entertainment and real estate areas. in the entertainment industry it is not uncommon for there to be a production company formed strictly for the production of one movie or television show. Because of the way it is financed or distributed it is hard to tell when you look at the credits. (As they are involved in distribution it does allow for some leeway in getting satisfaction if there is a problem.) The real estate part I know of is that it is not unheard of for the bigger company to form a LLC (Limited Liability Corporation) to actually construct a building. After the building is built the LLC “sells” the building but it is always done that they continue to hold all responsibilities for the construction, but that is just for show as it ceases to exist. “Blankfein went ahead anyhow.” Sounds like Llyod could serve in any number of ‘representative’ elected offices. Interesting reading the background to the idea corporations have to but shareholders first. It always bugged me for two reasons. I mean General Electric couldn’t decide ro day that they were going to start importing and selling heroin as they thought it would give a better return to shareholders. Clearly they still have to follow the laws of the land of face the consequences. And secondly, even if it was the case that it was a legal requirement, so what? It’s nit a law of nature or of physics. It could only ever be a law of man and those can be changed. As I recall, some conservatives advocate that corporations should violate laws if the profits ensuing from violating the laws are larger than the associated penalty. Maybe this is a calculation done by citizens as well, so corporations would be following Citizens United into people hood. A country could enforce laws and set the penalties for law violation high enough to discourage societal harmful behaviors. But the USA seems to have harsh justice for little people with a policy of “friends don’t let friends do time” for the rich and connected. I never go over the Ford pardon of Nixon as the pardon was justified as healing to the nation and Nixon had “suffered enough”. . In an it will never happen desire, I desperately want there to be minimum fines attached to overcharging or embezzling the government. I recognize that the system has been gamed enough that they don’t even have to pay back the government (see the special master throwing out the DOJ case against United Health for overcharging Medicare by 2 billion dollars), but in my world not only would it be incumbent on United Health for proving that the various supposed treatments occurred and that the charges were accurate for those treatments. And if they weren’t they would be required to pay back the full amount plus an additional 50% of that amount just to keep their C suite executives out of jail. There should be no return on investment for deceiving customers and employees. AND bankruptcy law should be rewritten to have owner corporation continue to be on the stick for any lawsuits or liabilities from fraud or malfeasance of fully owned subsidiaries rather than allowing that to die with the bankruptcy of said subsidiary. Whenever I hear of a corporation skating in some manner, I remember that beacon of Republican responsibility prosecuting minor crimes in NY left and right (homeless people washing windshields, minor drug offenses, etc) because that was going to increase overall adherence to the law. I always compared it to the trickle down theory as in all profits go to the top and all penalties go to the bottom. It’s not really talked about much outside of law journals but all of the British colonies in America were set up as corporate entities, not just the Virginia Company. If you read the charters of each of them, it’s truly not far off from corporate organization documents of today. The legacy of this structure remains and it seems very anachronistic but I guess it’s all we got. +1 on the reform path of Cooperatives. Just change the bylaws of a corporation to one member = one share/vote, you bring in democracy and accountability of the management to the workers. And I know this may sound crazy, but if, in the same spirit and reasoning chattel slavery was made illegal, we could do the same to human rental (i.e. wage system), all corporations with employees would effectively have to become Worker-Cooperatives. Instead of Capital renting humans, Humans would rent capital, which makes much more sense. It’s a great path towards democracy….. The venerable Hudson’s Bay Company shuttered its last retail store just a few months ago. The end of an era. Fond memories of their iconic point blankets and clothing. I bought one of the point blankets a couple of years ago as a sort of nostalgic, ironic hat tip to the early days of Canadian colonization, well aware as I am of the horrors that came with it. They were not made in Canada — Yorkshire, I think. I have no love for the Weston family but they just bought the original HBC charter and are donating it to a museum. https://www.piquenewsmagazine.com/the-mix/not-meant-to-be-manitoba-museum-reflects-as-bay-charter-heads-elsewhere-11049467 HBC was Canada’s East India Company, another example of colonialism at its worst. Very fine intro, Yves. A corporate charter was at one time simply a grant by the sovereign of limited liability to protect investors from being dragged underwater by a failing business concern. An investor might lose their share value in a business failure but their other assets were protected. This promoted investment in enterprises which benefitted the polity as a whole by building necessary infrastructure and providing employment. Under today’s system of Inverted Totalitarianism the corporations control the sovereign state through massive infusions of campaign cash while looting infrastructure and destroying employment in order to enrich corporate executives and officers encouraged by stock “incentive” compensation to game short-term performance through looting. Self-dealing executives and officers becoming major shareholders created an enormous conflict of interest. The “Last have become the First” negating the entire social justification for a sovereign grant of corporate status. All of which was proceeded by an ideology cut from/cobbled together and funded by Capital from bastardized theology aka TINA/Powell memo thingy … Thank you, Yves, for this article and the fine commentary. It’s indeed frustrating to see the zombie shareholder primacy myth making rounds, raising again from the dead to eat our brains. That’s specially true when the author even cites Lynn Stout, arguably the most important scholar to debunk this myth. But there’s one point I wanted to ask you for further thoughts, if you’d be kind enough to bear with me. I always thought that it was part of the plan for the ETF managers of the world (particularly BlackRock) to wield greater influence over big corporations. They certainly make loads of money with ETF on their own right, but when you index something like S&P500, you’re making sure you have the right stocks, i.e. of the corporations that actually matter right now. Ditto for oil, tech, whatever. It makes it much easier to coordinate a strategy among them. The common assumption is that Blackrock, Vanguard etc. are sitting on their hands with that much power on their hands. Although you’re right that they won’t sell the shares as a form of pressure, they can still vote as shareholders. Not selling their shares makes their threat more worrisome in this case. BlackRock became more notorious because it tried to do the old Whig/Democrat/liberal/”woke” thing of pretending to care about ESG etc. and, after this is accepted and normalized, legitimately exert its own illegitimate control for its own purposes. As the article noticed, the worst kind of push-back materialized (the Tory/Republican/”conservative” one); instead of pretending to care, we won’t even pretend anymore and outright burn anyone suggesting that we care about the environment, society, workers, consumers… Unfortunately, most of the evidence I have is my tin foil hat and the eternal lust for power of these groups. But you really think that the voting rights they get from significant proportions of shares in big companies is siting idle? I also don’t think I understood the 401(k) argument. Is it that corporations choose these institutional investors for managing the pension funds? Thanks for bearing with me! No, they will always vote with management (save extremely bad governance abuses) because they want the 401(k) business, which has vastly higher margins than running index funds. Tons of fees and grifting via how they handle trades by plan participants in and out of funds. Also the margins on index funds are too thin to support any kind of corporate lobbying. You actually have to have a reasoned position on important proxy issues. That takes staff. Indexers compete on the tightness of their index replication and having the lowest fees possible. Any extra expenses undermine competitiveness. A finer epitaph I know not … In full agreement as an owner of index mutual funds and ETFs. As an owner of Vanguard funds, my understanding of the corporate model is each fund exists as a entity with the fund share holders acting as beneficial owners, though I generally don’t vote or give a proxy for the annual meetings. The funds as a group own the actual “Vanguard” that provides all the services to the funds. As an investor, I mostly take an interest in managed funds when they want to pass resolutions changing the fundamental investing rules (what they can buy and hold). I have seen in the past efforts to allow funds to hold what I consider riskier holdings in order to goose short term returns. The link to the 1919 Dodge v. Ford case was interesting. Yves, great intro! The pep talks we got from upper management about “shareholder values” always made more sense when one substituted “my bonus”. And once all my co-workers saw how they were implementing these “shareholder values”, we realized that had morphed into “bone us”. Your email address will not be published.

Title: Ethereum Is 10 Years Old As The SEC Chair Heralds DeFi As The Future Of Finance

ByLawrence Wintermeyer ByLawrence Wintermeyer, Contributor. On July 30, 2025, Ethereum celebrated 10 years since its launch, marking a new milestone in crypto history. With a decade-long record of uninterrupted uptime, it has laid the foundations for DeFi and an era of open public digital networks that serve all of society. In the past decade, Ethereum has traversed uncharted territory, from a unique fundraising strategy called the Initial Coin Offering (ICO) in 2014, raising $18.3 million, to hosting Blackrock’s first public onchain money market fund last year - you’ve come a long way baby. Regulatory clarity in the American economy now plays a big role in Ethereum’s future. Since the SEC’s massive crackdown on ICOs in 2018, accusing them of violating securities laws, the agency has itself come a long way in the past few months in under a new chair. Recently, SEC chair, Paul Atkins, gave a speech on “American Leadership in the Digital Finance Revolution”. In the speech, he highlighted Trump’s Executive Order to make America the “crypto capital of the world” and that the “DNA of the DeFi movement embodies American ideals like economic liberty, private property rights, and innovation.” Atkins explicitly stated that the right to self-custody digital assets is a "core American value," emphasizing the importance of individuals having control over their own property, and announced the kick off of Project Crypto aimed at modernizing SEC custody rules to accommodate crypto assets, including exploring exemptive relief and potential rule changes to allow market participants to operate efficiently. The SEC is considering an "innovation exemption" to protect DeFi projects from overly restrictive regulations, allowing them to operate within a more flexible framework. Atkins defended developers of self-custody wallets and DeFi applications, stating that they shouldn't be held liable for how users utilize their software, comparing it to holding car manufacturers responsible for traffic accidents. He also highlighted the resilience of self-executing, on-chain systems, particularly in contrast to centralized platforms and stressed the need for regulatory clarity regarding core crypto activities like staking and mining, stating that they should not be automatically classified as securities. The SEC issued a clarification this week that properly structured liquid‑staking protocols and their receipt tokens generally do not constitute securities under U.S. law. Happy 10th Birthday Ethereum, the SEC has honored you by giving the DeFi ecosystem the best gift ever – regulatory clarity that supports DeFi as the future for financial services, and you are the DeFi market leader - a worthy award for the groundbreaking innovation you have brought us. On this momentous occasion, let’s look back at how Ethereum built the underlying architecture for dapps as it is positioned to play a central role in daily interactions and enterprise systems in the financial services sector in decade to come. Ethereum draws its strength from a strong developer community that emphasizes strengthening the network’s infrastructure. Trevor Koverko, co-Founder of Polymath and Sapien, commented, “For a decade, Ethereum has paved the way for tech founders to tinker with their ideas and build something meaningful. "Take the example of the ERC-20 token standard. It transformed the idea of token launches and brought uniformity in value transfers without worrying about liquidity fragmentation across different blockchains. "The 2017-18 ICO boom did lead to the growth of scam tokens, but that’s negligible collateral damage. Scammers gave serious projects the incentives and confidence to build something that delivered real value on a secure and decentralized network like Ethereum. “Ever since, builders have doubled down on token standards, with the introduction of ERC-721 for NFTs, ERC-1155 to combine fungible and non-fungible attributes, ERC-1400 for compliant security tokens, and many others.” Ethereum has, however, had its share of dark days. In 2016, the Ethereum DAO suffered a $60 million exploit, leading to a permanent split of the blockchain. The new chain after the hard fork reversed the network to the moment before the theft and continued as Ethereum, while the older one is now called Ethereum Classic. As Qi Wu, co-Founder of PLVR, explained, “From the DAO fork to hundreds of exploits, Ethereum paid the price early. But those lessons created the best developer tooling, auditing practices, and frameworks in the space. Today, building on Ethereum is safer, smarter, and more robust than ever.” Rome wasn’t built in a day, and neither was Ethereum - It took its time to gain the confidence of its well-knit community of developers and users to build a robust network. Elaborating on Ethereum’s trust-building exercise, Alexander Cutler, co-founder of Aerodrome, a DEX on Base, said, “Entering a trustless global system, ironically, requires trustworthiness. And Ethereum has earned it over the past 10 years by consistently leading the way with uncompromising infrastructure built to last the next 100 years.” No one thought Ethereum would become such a time-tested and reliable backbone of onchain interactions. Isidoros Passadis, head of staking and core contributor at Lido, noted, “Ten years ago, Ethereum was just a bold experiment. Today, it supports billions in economic activity and is reshaping finance, governance, and coordination worldwide.” Echoing that sentiment, Michael Huynh, co-founder of DCentral Conference, said, “Ethereum is no longer an experiment. It’s now a pillar of the crypto industry. From an idea ten years ago to a thriving ecosystem with thousands of companies innovating the future of tech — it has transcended the speculative norms to redefine technologies that were once just mere theories.” With the end of the first decade, the age of experimentation at Ethereum is over. The next decade is about iteration and doubling down on its strengths to lead research and development in the digital assets space. Billy Luedtke, ceo and founder of Intuition, remarked, “After ten years of head-down engineering, Ethereum’s infrastructure has quietly crossed a threshold: it’s now sturdy enough for mainnet, mission-critical workloads. "Advancements such as rollups, data availability layers, account abstraction, and staking — ideas that were truly no more mature than prototypes a few years ago — have hardened into audited production systems. We can finally retire the “test in prod” meme and start migrating the world’s first financial system onto the credibly neutral rails of Ethereum. "Crucially, the network effects that matter most — security, developer mindshare, and tooling — have only deepened. Competing chains still sell “faster and cheaper”, yet Ethereum’s roadmap (verkle trees, danksharding, recursive L3s) points to near-infinite scalability without sacrificing decentralization.” As Ethereum matures and sets a target for the next decade, its strength lies in advancing crypto’s core strength of decentralized internet - Web3 - architecture. There’s a reason why Ether (ETH) is the OG altcoin, next only to bitcoin, in terms of market cap and popularity. Wu explains, “Ethereum is still the most used chain because it’s where developers go first, where trust is highest, liquidity deepest, and infrastructure most mature. L1 remains the secure backbone, while L2s like Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base deliver scalability. "This layered design, shaped by a community committed to credible neutrality and decentralization, attracts the best builders and drives Ethereum’s continued leadership in developer activity, app composability, and settlement value.” It is Ethereum’s commitment to the blockchain’s primary principles that makes it a winner. Cutler says, “Ethereum hasn’t sacrificed the security or neutrality of its infrastructure, even though it had immense pressures to do so in exchange for greater adoption, profits, and market share. This is why, as the world comes onchain, Ethereum is the only credible infrastructure that has the track record and consistent practices to support its adoption at scale.” On a similar vein, Passadis adds, “As Ethereum moves into its second decade, more institutions and individuals are seeing the value of its decentralization and neutrality. This growing interest gives us a genuine opportunity to reinforce these core principles actively. By thoughtfully welcoming new participants, we can make sure Ethereum stays resilient, inclusive, and truly open to everyone. "Ethereum’s strength has always come from collective participation. If we carefully align future growth with the values that got us here, the next decade will firmly establish Ethereum as the trusted and neutral foundation for the global economy.” The institutional demand is evident from the market data. ETH ETFs have recorded massive monthly inflows of $5.4 billion in July, as Ethereum celebrated its 10th anniversary. Since June, crypto treasury firms have also acquired more than 1% of ETH’s circulating supply, outpacing Bitcoin treasury funds. Luedtke explained, “The market has noticed. Institutions like BlackRock have turned ETH from a “venture bet” into an allocation-worthy treasury asset, giving institutions a compliance-ready onramp to staking yield and onchain participation. "Meanwhile, Robinhood has begun issuing tokenized U.S. equities on an Ethereum-based L2, offering its European users 24/7 trading and instant settlement — an early glimpse of Wall Street’s operating system in the cloud. For the first time, the buy-side is dragging the sell-side (and the regulators) towards on-chain infrastructure rather than waiting for banks to lead.” Huynh observed, “Ethereum’s future is still untold. As newer companies from every sector build on the blockchain and start experimenting, the more we’ll see newer tools emerging. RWAs, decentralized treasuries, stocks, ETFs, loans, NFTs, games, AI — all these sectors are beginning to emerge, and I believe they would multiply demand drastically.” Luedtke says, “We’re still only in inning one. An infinite roadmap — including stateless clients, unified liquidity across rollups, and richer data-and-identity layers — remains on deck for the infinite garden of Ethereum. "Ethereum’s real promise is bigger than finance: it is an open, programmable trust layer for society — exactly the kind of substrate we’ll need to prevent AI-era power structures from ossifying behind black box algorithms and closed APIs, ensuring through code that no one person or group has too much power.” The next decade of Ethereum’s journey will be about further developing the plumbing – the backend infrastructure - and solving real problems with innovative onchain products, without compromising on decentralization and security. It sounds rather boring, but it is this steady hand on the tiller and commitment to quality scaling and network growth that is the backbone of the digital Financial Market Infrastructure (dFMI) game, and is the not-so-secret sauce that wins support from developers and financial institutions alike. And let’s not forget the SEC’s role in accelerating the growth and adoption of DeFi into the next decade. Here’s to the next 10 years of Ethereum – the OG that started the DeFi movement – may the force be with you.

About Greystone Housing Impact Investors LP Greystone Housing Impact Investors LP was formed in 1998 under the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act for the primary purpose of acquiring, holding, selling and otherwise dealing with a portfolio of mortgage revenue bonds which have been issued to provide construction and/or permanent financing for affordable multifamily, seniors and student housing properties. The Partnership is pursuing a business strategy of acquiring additional mortgage revenue bonds and other investments on a leveraged basis. The Partnership expects and believes the interest earned on these mortgage revenue bonds is excludable from gross income for federal income tax purposes. The Partnership seeks to achieve its investment growth strategy by investing in additional mortgage revenue bonds and other investments as permitted by its Second Amended and Restated Limited Partnership Agreement, dated December 5, 2022 (the “Partnership Agreement”), taking advantage of attractive financing structures available in the securities market, and entering into interest rate risk management instruments.

We anticipate that subsequent events and developments will cause our expectations and beliefs to change. The Partnership assumes no obligation to update such forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this document or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events, unless obligated to do so under the federal securities laws. * The amounts indicated above have been adjusted to reflect the distribution completed on April 30, 2024 in the form of additional BUCs at a ratio of 0.00417 BUCs for each BUC outstanding as of March 28, 2024 on a retroactive basis. Disclosure Regarding Non-GAAP Measures - Cash Available for Distribution The Partnership believes that CAD provides relevant information about the Partnership’s operations and is necessary, along with net income, for understanding its operating results. To calculate CAD, the Partnership begins with net income as computed in accordance with GAAP and adjusts for non-cash expenses or income consisting of depreciation expense, amortization expense related to deferred financing costs, amortization of premiums and discounts, fair value adjustments to derivative instruments, provisions for credit and loan losses, impairments on MRBs, GILs, real estate assets and property loans, deferred income tax expense (benefit), and restricted unit compensation expense. The Partnership also adjusts net income for the Partnership’s share of (earnings) losses of investments in unconsolidated entities related to the Market Rate Joint Venture Investments segment as such amounts are primarily depreciation expenses and development costs that are expected to be recovered upon an exit event. The Partnership also deducts Tier 2 income (see Note 22 to the Partnership’s condensed consolidated financial statements) distributable to the General Partner as defined in the Partnership Agreement and distributions and accretion for the Preferred Units. Net income is the GAAP measure most comparable to CAD. There is no generally accepted methodology for computing CAD, and the Partnership’s computation of CAD may not be comparable to CAD reported by other companies. Although the Partnership considers CAD to be a useful measure of the Partnership’s operating performance, CAD is a non-GAAP measure that should not be considered as an alternative to net income calculated in accordance with GAAP, or any other measures of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP. The following table shows the calculation of CAD (and a reconciliation of the Partnership’s net income, as determined in accordance with GAAP, to CAD) for the three and six months ended June 30, 2025 and 2024 (all per BUC amounts are presented giving effect to the distributions in form of additional BUCs on a retroactive basis for all periods presented): (1) The adjustments reflect the change in allowances for credit losses under the CECL standard which requires the Partnership to update estimates of expected credit losses for its investment portfolio at each reporting date. Credit losses are not reported within CAD until such loses are realized. The provision for credit loss for the three and six months ended June 30, 2025 includes asset-specific provisions for credit losses for affordable multifamily investments totaling approximately $9.3 million. In connection with the final settlement of the bankruptcy estate of the Provision Center 2014-1 MRB in July 2024, the Partnership recovered approximately $169,000 of its previously recognized allowance credit loss which is not included as an adjustment to net income in the calculation of CAD for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024. (2) As described in Note 22 to the Partnership’s condensed consolidated financial statements, Net Interest Income representing contingent interest and Net Residual Proceeds representing contingent interest (Tier 2 income) will be distributed 75% to the limited partners and BUC holders, as a class, and 25% to the General Partner. This adjustment represents 25% of Tier 2 income due to the General Partner. Tier 2 income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2025 related to the gain on sale of Vantage at Helotes and the premium received upon redemption of the Companion at Thornhill Apartments MRB. There was no Tier 2 income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024. (3) The Partnership determined there was a recovery of previously recognized impairment recorded for the Live 929 Apartments Series 2022A MRB prior to the adoption of the CECL standard effective January 1, 2023. The Partnership is accreting the recovery of prior credit loss for this MRB into investment income over the term of the MRB consistent with applicable guidance.

Title: BlackRock Dumps Ethereum, Over $375M in a Single Day – Is the ETH Price Set to Fall?

Ethereum price is facing some challenges after BlackRock, one of the biggest asset management firms, sold over $375 million worth of Ethereum in just one day. This move has made some investors nervous, wondering if the Ethereum price will drop even more. Meanwhile, Remittix (RTX), a fast-growing cryptocurrency, has been seeing impressive gains, already up more than 500% in 2025. Source: TradingView On August 5, blockchain data showed that BlackRock moved 101,975 Ethereum into Coinbase Prime, worth about $372 million. This caused some uncertainty in the market, with Ethereum price falling to around $3,611, a 1.4% drop on the day and almost 5% down for the week. In addition to this, Ethereum ETFs faced big outflows of around $600 million, though some of that was later recovered. Currently, Ethereum price is facing strong resistance near $3.10. If it can’t break through, it could face more declines. The price is also stuck in a symmetrical triangle pattern on the chart, which often signals a major price move is coming. If Ethereum fails to hold above $3,583, it may drop further. While Ethereum price is struggling, Remittix (RTX) is quietly building momentum. Remittix has raised over $18.2 million through the sale of 583 million tokens, each priced at $0.0895. This new crypto payment platform is quickly becoming popular because of its focus on low-fee, fast, and secure crypto payments across 30+ countries. Here are some reasons why Remittix could outperform other cryptos like Ethereum in the future: With its potential uses in business and individuals, Remittix will remain in the spotlight as its user base increases. Compared to Ethereum, which is yet to gain acceptance in the marketplace, Remittix is gaining traction and has a chance to turn the crypto payments industry upside down. As Ethereum price struggles with resistance and declines in the market, Remittix is an excellent long-term investment. With real-world applications in the payment sector, Remittix offers consistent growth and has a much clearer path forward compared to the volatility of speculative assets like Ethereum. As Remittix continues to develop, it could become one of the best crypto investments for the future.

Former England international Ellena Perry is set to make her Ireland debut off the bench in the World Cup warm-up game against Canada at the Affidea Stadium in Belfast on Saturday (12pm). The 28-year-old Gloucester-Hartpury prop, who won 11 caps for England, the last in November 2020, qualifies for Ireland through a maternal grandfather. It comes a week after another former English international, the Hong Kong-born centre Nancy McGillivray made a try-scoring debut for Ireland in the 27-21 win over Scotland at Musgrave Park. Irish head coach Scott Bemand has made 10 changes to the starting side that beat Scotland in Cork last weekend. Wing Béibhinn Parsons, outhalf Dannah O’Brien and the backrow of Grace Moore, Ivana Kiripati and Brittany Hogan are retained. Hooker Neve Jones will lead out the run-on team as captain Sam Monaghan is named among the replacements. In the pack, Niamh O’Dowd and Linda Djougang join Jones in the frontrow. Fiona Tuite and Ruth Campbell make up the engine room. Connacht’s Aoibheann Reilly starts at scrumhalf, Enya Breen partners Aoife Dalton in the centre with Anna McGann and Stacey Flood coming into the back three. Bemand said: “Having another opportunity to test ourselves is essential in the run up to the Rugby World Cup and we know Canada will provide us with a really strong test. “Last week we fought back hard from conceding early tries and we know we will need to start stronger this week. There is a lot at stake with the squad for the Rugby World Cup being announced early next week.” Ireland open their World Cup campaign against Japan at Franklin’s Gardens on Sunday, August 24th. They also face Spain and New Zealand in the pool stages of the tournament. IRELAND (v Canada, World cup-warm-up, Affidea Stadium, Belfast, Saturday, 12pm): Stacey Flood (Railway Union/Leinster); Béibhinn Parsons (Blackrock College/Connacht), Aoife Dalton (Old Belvedere/Leinster), Enya Breen (Blackrock College/Munster), Anna McGann (Railway Union); Dannah O’Brien (Old Belvedere/Leinster), Aoibheann Reilly (Blackrock College/Connacht); Niamh O’Dowd (Old Belvedere/Leinster), Neve Jones (Gloucester Hartpury), Linda Djougang (Old Belvedere/Leinster); Ruth Campbell (Old Belvedere/Leinster), Fiona Tuite (Old Belvedere/Ulster); Grace Moore (Trailfinders/IQ Rugby), Ivana Kiripati (Creggs/Connacht), Brittany Hogan (Old Belvedere/Ulster).

Title: Behind GeoWealth’s Latest $38M Funding Round

Time Published: 2025-08-07T10:10:00Z

There is growing demand for private market allocations, especially among less wealthy clients who historically haven’t had access to them. Griffin Kelly griffin@thedailyupside.com Not everyone has the dashing good looks to be a model. Would you settle for a model portfolio? GeoWealth, a leading turnkey asset management platform, secured $38 million in Series C funding this week led by Apollo, with the two firms planning to offer RIAs customizable public-private model portfolios. The latest round of funding also included an $18 million growth investment from last year led by BlackRock, and comes as advisors are increasingly interested in using private market allocations in model portfolios — especially for mass affluent clients, who historically haven’t had access to alternatives. The Chicago-based company, which currently works with about 200 RIAs and has $32 billion in client assets under administration, will use the funding for product development and new hires while also putting some toward its recently completed acquisition of the TAMP assets from Freedom Advisors. “Advisors are seeking turnkey access to private markets,” GeoWealth CEO Colin Falls said in a statement. Model portfolios were designed to take some of the thinking out of asset allocation, offering clients pre-built investing strategies based on their goals and risk levels. “Clients often feel overwhelmed by the sheer multitude of investment options,” said Sam Mockford, a CFP at Citrine Capital. “When it comes time to rebalance, if I did not have a recipe to follow, I could fall prey to recency bias, herd mentality, etc., and harm my clients in the long-term.” Model portfolios’ popularity among advisors is showing no signs of slowing. Assets in third-party model portfolios — as in strategies that aren’t made in-house by an RIA — totaled more than $645 billion at the end of March 2025, a 62% increase from Morningstar’s last survey of the space in June 2023. The demand for private asset inclusions in model portfolios and similar strategies is also growing: “Investors are increasingly looking beyond public markets for greater diversification and differentiated returns,” Stephanie Drescher, chief client and product development officer at Apollo, said in a statement. The funds could open the world of sports investing to a brand new segment of customers. The firm said the funding will go toward acquisitions and tech innovation. Apollo Global Management CEO Marc Rowan believes that allocations to private markets will make up a third of client portfolios in the future. Empower is adding private market allocations with collective investment trusts used in managed accounts. The announcement follows similar plans by prominent asset managers like State Street, Apollo, KKR and Capital Group. The world’s second-largest asset manager has been known for taking a low-cost approach to investing over its 50-year history. The announcement follows the introduction of a public and private ETF from State Street and Apollo last month. The round was led by State Street Global Advisors and will go toward building out Ethic’s accounts and model portfolios. CEO Josh Brown is investing in AI-powered lead generator FINNY, while director of research Michael Batnick is launching Exhibit A, a data visualization platform. Advisors tend to work with lawyers for their estate planning needs, but digital platforms can help expand those services to more clients. Market penetration for customer relationship management software has fallen more than 10% in the past two years, according to a new survey. The agency asked pointed questions about the new exchange-traded fund just hours after its launch last week. © 2025 The Daily Upside

Title: The stock market still has a $7 trillion secret weapon that could boost gains into year-end
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/stock-market-outlook-7-trillion-money-markets-cash-sp500-returns-2025-8
Time Published: 2025-08-07T09:15:01Z
Full Content:
Investors might be sitting on a secret weapon that could send stocks soaring. That's according to Wall Street strategists, who say that a big reason to be bullish on stocks in the near term is the record $7 trillion in cash investors have stored in money markets fund. That money — sidelined in assets like US Treasurys, money market mutual funds, and other short-term, highly-liquid debt instruments — could eventually make its way back into equities. That would be a huge boom for stocks, according to Savita Subramanian, the head of US equity and quantitative strategy at Bank of America. "We've still got a lot of cash, still got a lot of fixed income on the plate," Subramanian said, speaking to CNBC on Wednesday, speculating that money could make its way into equities once the Fed resumes its rate-cutting cycle. Central bankers trimmed rates twice in late 2024, but have held off on a third rate cut as they assess the impact of tariffs on inflation. But investors have ramped up bets for rate cuts after a weak July jobs report last Friday, betting that the Fed will cut rates at its September meeting. Markets are pricing in a 95.1% chance the Fed could issue a 25-basis-point rate cut at its next policy meeting, according to the CME FedWatch tool. The return on cash and bonds is also "not great," Subramanian added, another reason investors could eventually plough cash back into the stock market. Others have also touted the potential boost from record amounts of cash coming off the sidelines. Tom Lee, the head of research at Fundstrat, said it is one reason he remains optimistic on equities in a note last month. Lee, known as permabull bull on Wall Street, said he still sees the S&P 500 reaching 6,600 by the end of the year, implying around 4% upside from current levels. "The bull market has proven itself intact," he wrote, referring to the benchmark index's record-breaking rally in recent months. Kristy Akullian, the head of iShares investment strategy in the Americas at BlackRock, also referenced the large amount of cash in money market funds recently. "A portion of those funds could be poised to come off the sidelines if investors — like us — anticipate rate cuts without an accompanying recession," she wrote. Jump to

Bitcoin held above $114,500 as institutional inflows returned, lifting sentiment and technical momentum. Ethereum and altcoins also gained. Analysts cited strong liquidity zones, ETF inflows, and macro factors supporting long-term bullishness, despite short-term resistance and volatility.

Title: Ethereum Price Rebounds, Traders Are Scooping Up Pepe and This New ETH Memecoin Set For 150x Gains
URL: https://partner.cryptopolitan.com/ethereum-price-rebounds-traders-are-scooping-up-pepe-and-this-new-eth-memecoin-set-for-150x-gains/
Time Published: 2025-08-07T04:21:05Z
Full Content:
Ethereum prices cooled off this weekend after briefly flirting with the hallowed $4K range, dipping below $3,400. However, at the beginning of the week, the leading Layer-1 protocol bounced back to reclaim $3,560. But whilst whales are buying ETH in droves, the smart money is looking elsewhere for serious gains—and the next ETH meme token earmarked by analysts for 150x gains has arrived in the form of Layer Brett ($LBRETT). Pundits believe that the Ethereum Layer 2 scalability solution memecoin is fully primed to outpace even Ethereum itself with staking rewards above 20,000% APY and explosive price potential. Learn why this low-cap blue chip gem in its crypto presale stage is seen in crypto circles as the next big thing. Despite the recent uptick in Ethereum prices due to whale activity and on-chain ETF holdings surging to 40% in the past month—not to mention institutional giants like BlackRock also ramping up—its fundamental issues remain unsolved. Ethereum paved the way for smart contracts, but it hasn’t aged gracefully. High gas fees and slow confirmation times persist, requiring a legitimate Ethereum Layer 2 geared specifically to tackle these pain points head-on. Here’s why Layer Brett solves them: Layer Brett makes your Ethereum transactions run smoothly, bull or bear market notwithstanding, by processing transactions offchain and syncing securely back to the Ethereum mainnet. Most meme tokens are just hype with no real features. That’s not the case here with Layer Brett. Beneath the viral-inducing packaging, Layer Brett offers massive utility. It’s a fully scalable, functional blockchain project with actual user benefits. Through its native dApp, users can stake $LBRETT in seconds, earning massive yields powered by low operating costs. Ethereum staking, by contrast, involves lockups, centralization risk, and far lower returns. Layer Brett offers strictly better rewards—adding fun to function altogether. Ethereum will always be a foundational piece of crypto infrastructure. But traders are increasingly diversifying into projects like Layer Brett that offer meme coin upside with actual blockchain substance. While Ethereum is valued in the hundreds of billions, $LBRETT is still under the radar. That means there’s more room for exponential growth. And with current Ethereum gas fees still reaching $10–$20 during congestion, it’s no surprise users are migrating to Ethereum Layer 2 solutions like Layer Brett. Unlike basic meme plays, Layer Brett fuses viral appeal with real infrastructure. It’s meme-born, utility-built. This project is already generating massive attention as one of the top diamonds in the rough in presale right now. With just 10 billion tokens, a transparent tokenomics model, and a $1 million giveaway, early buyers are perfectly positioned for huge upside. Add in NFT integration, gamified staking, and future cross-chain interoperability, and it’s clear Layer Brett is built to scale. Ethereum led the revolution—but now, Layer Brett is pushing it further. With the speed of Layer 2, the power of community, and the potential for 150x gains, this is the best crypto to invest in before the next crypto bull run in 2025 kicks off. Buy, stake, and meme your way into the future. Don’t let this Layer 2 rocket take off without you. Layer Brett is available in presale—but don’t wait too late. This is YOUR opportunity to get in early on the most scalable meme project to ever launch on Ethereum. Disclaimer. This is a Press Release.

Title: Ethereum’s $10B OI wipeout and ETF exodus: What happens to ETH?
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/ethereums-10b-oi-wipeout-and-etf-exodus-what-happens-to-eth/
Time Published: 2025-08-07T02:00:31Z
Full Content:
Can ETH reclaim $3,900 without ETF inflows? Ethereum is starting to show signs of distribution. Its ETFs saw the biggest outflow ever. That lines up with the drop below $3.6k. Is more downside coming? Ethereum’s [ETH] has been range-bound since tagging $3,900, and the price is now sitting at a key pivot. The 10% pullback off the highs looks like a textbook flush, clearing out weak longs and cooling overheated funding. Backing that up, over $10 billion in Open Interest got wiped out in just ten days. That’s a major de-risk across the board. Plus, we saw back-to-back $1 billion+ in Realized Profits, pointing to profit, not panic, as the main driver. Structurally, last week gave us Ethereum’s first proper weekly red candle in a while. It was a clean 9.67% pullback off the top. But this week’s already bounced back nearly 4%, so bulls aren’t out of the fight yet. Source: TradingView (ETH/USDT) That kind of resilience in a choppy market signals strong bid interest. Case in point: BlackRock scooped up 23k ETH ($88 million). It is a big tell that smart money’s still buying the dip. But is that enough to offset a $10 billion OI flush, especially with whale addresses down 164 in 30 days? According to AMBCrypto, that’s the real equation. How it resolves could dictate Ethereum’s next leg, especially with ETH/USDT longs now over 60% on Binance, showing a clear bullish crowd skew. Calling ETH’s 10% pullback a “healthy reset” might be jumping the gun. Early distribution signals are in play, and $3.9k is starting to look like a local top, or at least a level that’s going to need serious spot demand to break through again. Per SoSoValue, ETH ETF outflows just hit record levels, with over $500 million yanked in a single day. It’s a clear shift in institutional flows, flipping from steady July inflows to full-blown cooldown mode. Source: SoSoValue Meanwhile, Fidelity moved 14,978 ETH ($53.6 million) to Coinbase Prime, likely gearing up to sell into strength. That’s a textbook profit-taking play from smart money as the market turns risk-off. All eyes are now on ETH’s 4% bounce off the lows. If these outflows keep coming and whales keep trimming, we could see a liquidation cascade with $60 million in liquidity stacked around the $3,500 level. In short, Ethereum’s bounce has legs. But it’s walking a tightrope. Disclaimer: AMBCrypto's content is meant to be informational in nature and should not be interpreted as investment advice.

Title: Donald Trump Outlines Economic Alternative to Migration
URL: https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/08/06/donald-trump-outlines-economic-alternative-to-migration/
Time Published: 2025-08-06T22:14:30Z

President Donald Trump outlined his support for a low-migration/high-productivity economy in an interview with Breitbart News. “We’re going to need robots … to make our economy run because we do not have enough people,” he told Breitbart News, adding: We don’t enough people to do it. So we have to get efficient … we’ll probably add to [the existing workforce] through robotically—it’s going to be robotically … It’s going to be big. Then, somebody is going to have to make the robots. The whole thing, it feeds on itself … we’re going to streamline things. We need efficiency. July data showing a drop in the number of working migrants is welcome news, Trump told CNBC on August 5. “That’s a great number because it means we’re putting Americans to work.” Trump’s comments sketch a possible new economic strategy, said Mark Krikorian, founder of the Center for Immigration Studies. He continued: I don’t think they’ve gotten to the point of talking about robotics and AI as a substitute for migration … This is something that it would behoove the administration to present in a more rigorous and thought-out way where they actually connect the dots and explain what it is they have in mind. Our whole debate needs to get away from this “Legal [immigration] good/illegal [immigration] bad” dichotomy and talk about how the large-scale importation of foreign labor, whether it’s legal or illegal, whether it’s permanent or temporary, affects future productivity in a negative way. [The productivity alternative] provides voters with an understanding of why we should be enforcing the immigration law: Why do we want less illegal immigration? Yes, it’s illegal, obviously. And yes, some of them are criminals, but most of them aren’t …. We need to do this [enforcement] precisely because it will lead to higher productivity down the road with these advances in robotics and AI. Trump’s emphasis on robots reflects chatter in elite circles about the need to grow the economy and prosperity via productivity. If enacted, it would be a big shift from the post-1990 policy of inflating the stock market by extracting workers, consumers, and renters from poor countries. The promise of cheap labor is ” a drug that too many American firms got addicted to … [and] globalization’s hunger for cheap labor is a problem precisely because it’s been bad for innovation,” Vice President JD Vance told an audience of Silicon Valley investors in May. He added: And whether we’re offshoring factories to cheap labor economies, or importing cheap labor through our immigration system, cheap labor became the drug of Western economies. And I’d say that if you look in nearly every country, from Canada to the UK that imported large amounts of cheap labor, you’ve seen productivity stagnate. That’s not a total happenstance. I think that the connection is very direct. “I can argue, in the developed countries, the big winners are the countries that have shrinking populations,” BlackRock founder Larry Fink said at a 2024 pro-globalist event hosted by the World Economic Forum in Saudi Arabia. He continued: That’s something that most people never talked about. We always used to think [a] shrinking population is a cause for negative [economic] growth. But in my conversations with the leadership of these large, developed countries [such as China, and Japan] that have xenophobic anti-immigration policies, they don’t allow anybody to come in — [so they have] shrinking demographics — these countries will rapidly develop robotics and AI and technology … If a promise of all that transforms productivity, which most of us think it will [emphasis added] — we’ll be able to elevate the standard living in countries, the standard of living for individuals, even with shrinking populations. Some leaders in Western countries are recognizing the need to grow productivity, not foreign populations. That relook is being accelerated by the growing scale of crimes, corruption, and civic conflict caused by the migrant inflows. On July 23, Trump signed a national AI strategy and told his audience of investors: Perhaps most importantly, winning the AI race will demand a new spirit of patriotism and national loyalty in Silicon Valley and long beyond Silicon Valley. For too long, much of our tech industry pursued a radical globalism that left millions of Americans feeling distrustful and betrayed. And you know that, everybody knows that, everybody in this room certainly does. Many of our largest tech companies have reaped the blessings of American freedom while building their factories in China, hiring workers in India and slashing profits in Ireland. You know that. All the while dismissing and even censoring their fellow citizens right here at home. Under President Trump those days are over. We need US technology companies to be all in for America. We want you to put America first. You have to do that. That’s all we ask. But Trump’s strategy faces huge obstacles, including the demand by the investors in Fortune 500 companies for a greater inflow of cheap foreign white-collar workers. So far, Trump’s deputies have just a few curbs on the legalized white-collar migration. The inflow keeps at least 1.5 million foreign graduates in U.S. jobs, and pushes many American STEM, business, and healthcare graduates out of the middle class, and away from entrepreneurship and management careers. The migration inflow also helps the corporate directors to shift more investment and middle-class jobs back to India, regardless of the damage to professionalism, innovation, and national security. Investor groups and their progressive allies say they favor a policy that maximizes both productivity and migration, especially of Indian workers. But their advocates ignore the abundant evidence that migration reduces productivity while also expanding chaotic diversity and government spending. Major media outlets are also eager to hide any alternatives to migration, or even recognition of the economic costs of migration. For example, the editorial board at Jeff Bezos’ Washington Post argued on August 5 in favor of allowing illegal migrants to stay in the agriculture sector: “This frontal attack [by ICE] on farmers must end … They need relief from overregulation and excessive immigration enforcement.” Bezos owns Amazon.com, which gains from any inflow of foreign consumers into the U.S. economy. But Trump’s talk of robots may help inquisitive reporters describe the strategic choice, said Krikorian. “You need to give them the outline for them to write about it [because] you can’t expect most of them to be connecting the dots.” In another corner of U.S. politics, Trump is also trying to deliver manual-labor migrants to the GOP’s important farm-sector interest group. “Well, we want to take care of our American workers first and foremost, and that’s what we’re doing,” Trump told Breitbart News when he was asked about proposals to import more workers for the farm sector. “We also want to help our farmers because our farmers are producing like never before. We have to help them, and we’re working out some very complicated strategies and language.” “We can’t let our farmers not have anybody,” Trump told CNBC, adding: You know, these are very these people, they’re you can’t replace them very easily. You know, people that live in the inner city are not doing that work. They’re just not doing that work. And they’ve tried, we’ve tried. Everybody tried. They don’t do it. These people do it naturally, naturally. I said, what happens if they get it to a farmer the other day, what happens if they get a bad back? He said, they don’t get a bad back, sir, because if they get a bad back, they die. I said that’s interesting, isn’t it? Agriculture Secretary Rollins is talking up the need for greater automation in the farm sector, which is facing growing competition from low-wage countries. Congress has avoided the debate, but a growing number of GOP politicians are joining the productivity-beats-migration view. “They’re laying off all these American workers and then they’re importing H-1B visa people to work for cheaper,” Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said July 28. ” I think that’s a total scam,” he said. “Is that good policy for us as a country to have Americans put out of work and then to bring in H-1B [visa workers]?” Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.

Title: VanEck Says One Altcoin Ecosystem Seeing Early Institutional Tokenization Interest Amid Surge in Stablecoins

Crypto asset management giant VanEck says that one altcoin project is flashing major signs of institutional adoption. In a new report, VanEck highlights the growth of the Hedera (HBAR) ecosystem, which the firm notes in July, saw a price increase of over 70% due to a “wave of partnerships, network growth, and broadening institutional legitimization.” VanEck named several examples of notable adoption of the Hedera network in July, including the Reserve Bank of Australia’s Project Acacia, which aims to explore the development of Australian wholesale tokenized asset markets. Archax, the first regulated global digital asset exchange in the UK, also announced it would begin using the Hedera network for settlement purposes, VanEck notes. “Institutional tokenization activity is also emerging. In late July, Archax created Hedera token contracts named after BlackRock, Fidelity ILF, State Street, Aberdeen Investments, and LGIM. Archax’s CEO confirmed these represent money market funds that could soon transact in HBAR, signaling early but still prelaunch interest in real-world asset tokenization on the network.” And according to VanEck, stablecoin supply has exploded on Hedera. DefiLlama data shows that Hedera’s stablecoins are almost entirely driven by Circle’s USDC. “Hedera’s on-chain activity was strong as Hedera’s transactions surged as did the supply of stablecoins on its blockchain.” At time of writing, HBAR is trading at $0.24 with a market cap of $10.3 billion.

Title: Texas Gov. Wants Democrats Who Left State Kicked Out Of Office. Can He Legally Do It?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2025/08/06/texas-gov-wants-democrats-who-left-state-kicked-out-of-office-can-he-legally-do-it/
Time Published: 2025-08-06T16:37:52Z

ByAlison Durkee ByAlison Durkee, Forbes Staff. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott wants to oust from office the Democratic leader who fled the state to block Republican's attempt at redistricting — though it’s unclear if the latest move in the escalating battle over redistricting will actually work. Abbott filed a lawsuit with the state Supreme Court Tuesday that asks the court to declare that state Rep. Gene Wu, chair of the House Democratic Caucus, has forfeited his office by leaving the state. Wu and more than 50 of his Democratic colleagues left Texas on Sunday in order to block GOP lawmakers from changing the state’s congressional map to more heavily favor Republicans; their absence left the legislature short of the quorum that’s necessary in order to hold votes. Abbott argued the Supreme Court should expel Wu because the Democrat abdicated his position by leaving the state and refusing to show up for work, writing, “This Court should make clear that a legislator who does not wish to perform his duties will be stripped of them.” Texas law gives the state Supreme Court power to issue what’s called a “writ of quo warranto”—Latin for “by what warrant”—against state officials, which is a legal determination over whether the official has the right to hold office. Paxton also said he will take legal action against Democratic lawmakers if they don’t return to Texas by Friday, invoking a separate state law that gives attorneys general and district attorneys the power to file “quo warranto” petitions in court if a “public officer does an act or allows an act that by law causes a forfeiture of his office.” Wu has remained defiant—saying in a statement that leaving the state “was not an abandonment of my office; it was a fulfillment of my oath”—and it’s unclear if Abbott and Paxton’s legal gambit will work, whether for Wu or as a broader effort to expel Democratic lawmakers. Abbott has asked the state Supreme Court to rule on whether Wu has forfeited his office by Thursday at 5 p.m. local time, though Paxton asked justices to hold off on making their decision until Friday, which is Texas House Speaker Dustin Burrows’ deadline for Democratic lawmakers to return to the state. Paxton has said he “intends to pursue all available judicial remedies” if Democrats don’t return by Friday, including through the “quo warranto” petition process. It remains to be seen if the attorney general will also take aim at Wu specifically, or if he could file more legal challenges against all of the absent Democrats. “I took an oath to the Constitution, not to a politician’s agenda, and I will not be the one to break that oath,” Wu said in a statement Tuesday responding to Abbott’s lawsuit and allegations that the lawmaker has abdicated his duty as a legislator. “When a governor conspires with a disgraced president to ram through a racist gerrymandered map, my constitutional duty is to not be a willing participant … Unable to defend his corrupt agenda on its merits, Greg Abbott now desperately seeks to silence my dissent by removing a duly-elected official from office.” It will ultimately be up to the courts to determine whether or not lawmakers can be removed. The legal statute that Abbott invoked in his lawsuit doesn’t specify a legal process for the Supreme Court issuing a writ of quo warranto, and it remains to be seen if justices will draw out the process by asking for a hearing or additional court briefs to be filed. The separate statute giving Paxton and local district attorneys authority to ask courts to remove lawmakers says that if there’s “probable ground” to challenge a person’s office, local judges will ultimately decide the outcome of those requests. That suggests that any effort to remove lawmakers could take a while to play out, particularly if challenges are filed against multiple lawmakers in different courts. That would leave it up to each individual judge to determine when any rulings could come out, Politico notes, and Paxton told right-wing podcaster Benny Johnson that bringing “quo warranto” challenges won’t result in an “immediate answer” over whether lawmakers can be removed. “We’d have to go through the court process, and we’d have to file … in districts that are not friendly to Republicans,” Paxton told Johnson, noting “every, every district would be different.” “We’d have to go sue in every legislator’s home district to try to execute on that idea,” the attorney general said. It’s still unclear how the Texas Supreme Court could rule on Abbott’s request to expel Wu. In a 2021 legal opinion, Paxton said lawmakers breaking a quorum could constitute an “abandonment of office” that justifies removing them, but that opinion is non-binding, and Paxton said the issue must ultimately be decided by the courts. The state’s Supreme Court is made up exclusively of Republicans, including multiple justices that Abbott appointed himself. Chief Justice Jimmy Blacklock is also Abbott’s former general counsel, and the governor said when he appointed the justice in 2018 that he “wanted to make sure that the person I appointed was going to make decisions that I know how they are going to decide.” That being said, Blackrock authored a 2021 opinion that said the Texas Constitution “does enable quorum breaking by a minority faction,” suggesting Democrats’ actions are lawful—though he also said the Constitution allows lawmakers to impose penalties in order to compel members’ attendance. Legal experts cited by the Texas Tribune argued it’s unlikely that taking action to break a quorum would be considered abdicating a lawmaker’s duty, as Abbott claims. “I am aware of absolutely no authority that says breaking quorum is the same as the intent to abandon a seat,” University of Missouri constitutional law expert Charles “Rocky” Rhodes told the Tribune, arguing that would be “inconsistent with the very text of the Texas Constitution.” Democrats left the state in order to halt a special session of the legislature that’s slated to end in late August. They would have to stay out of state for even longer in order to actually block the redistricting process, however, as Abbott could simply call a new special session whenever they return. Lawmakers would have to stay out of Texas until at least November to successfully stop the new maps, Rice University political science professor Mark P. Jones told the Texas Tribune. That’s when filing opens for the 2026 midterms, meaning new congressional districts would have to be set by that point. It’s unclear if Democrats will successfully be able to stay out of state for that long, given lawmakers’ commitments at home and a $500 fine that accrues per lawmaker for each day they remain out of state. Texas Democrats’ decision to leave the state in order to block redistricting comes as the issue of changing states’ congressional maps outside the normal 10-year timeframe has become a national issue ahead of the 2026 midterms. Democrats are historically favored to fare better in the midterms as the minority party, prompting Republicans in states like Texas to try and manipulate congressional districts to their advantage and add GOP-leaning seats. In addition to Texas, Republican officials in states such as Missouri, Florida and Indiana have at least floated the idea of redistricting—prompting Democrats in states like California, New York and Maryland to also consider redrawing their maps in order to balance out any advantage Republicans give themselves. Texas has become the first flashpoint in the redistricting debate, with Democrats leaving the state Sunday afternoon—repeating a playbook that Texas Democrats have used before to stymie the legislature, most recently in 2021. Abbott’s lawsuit Tuesday came after the governor previously threatened over the weekend to take legal action against the lawmakers. The Texas House has separately issued arrest warrants for the missing lawmakers. Those warrants are ineffective while the lawmakers remain out of state, however, as Democratic lawmakers in the states where the legislators have relocated—primarily Illinois—have refused to extradite them to Texas to be prosecuted.

Title: Top-ranked 400m runner Conor Kelly leads Irish medal hopes at European Under-20 championships

Conor Kelly and Cormac Dixon will be looking to maintain the Irish athletics medals rush of recent weeks when the European Under-20 Championships get under way in Tampere, Finland on Thursday morning. It is 50 years since John Treacy claimed Ireland’s first medal in these championships, winning silver in the 5,000m in Athens in 1975. Plenty of other successful names have followed in his footsteps, including Mark Carroll, Ciara Mageean, Sarah Lavin, Sarah Healy, Kate O’Connor and Rhasidat Adeleke. At the last edition of these championships, two years ago in Jerusalem, Elizabeth Ndudi won gold in the long jump and Nick Griggs won silver in the 3,000m. There are similarly high expectations for the team of 38 athletes in Tampere. Kelly is the top-ranked Under-20 European in the 400m this season, his 45.85 clocked at the Morton Games last month the only sub-46-second entry. The Finn Valley AC athlete only turned 18 last month, but has considerable experience, winning his first Irish senior title indoors earlier this year. Dixon is the top-ranked athlete in the 3,000m, running 7:56.59 indoors in the US earlier this season, where the Tallaght AC athlete is on a running scholarship at Providence College, the same alma mater as Treacy. Precious Akpe-Moses from Blackrock AC is the top-ranked Irish athlete in the women’s 100m and 200m. She is hoping to emulate her older sister Gina, who won the European Under-20 100m title in 2017. The Irish men’s 4x400m team are also the top-ranked team in Europe this year. They can draw on individual qualifiers Kelly, Seán Doggett (Athenry AC) and Alex Cullen (Kilkenny City Harriers), along with David Davitt (Clonliffe Harriers), Andrew Hayes (Dundrum South Dublin AC) and Christopher Lynch (Clonliffe Harriers). [ Athletics Nick Griggs: ‘It very quickly went from a running injury to a serious medical illness’Opens in new window ] In the field events, 2024 European Under-18 medallist Cian Crampton (Edenderry AC) competes in the discus, after throwing a national Under-20 record of 58.32m at the start of June. Tampere has played host to Irish success before. In 2018 it was the venue when the Irish women’s 4x100m relay team of Adeleke, Molly Scott, Ciara Neville, Gina Akpe-Moses and Patience Jumbo-Gula won the silver medal in the World Under-20 Championships. Enya Silkena (Ratoath AC) will have been inspired by the success of Kate O’Connor in the heptathlon in recent times, achieving a personal best to qualify for the championships. Pia Langton (Kilkenny City Harriers) and Saoirse Fitzgerald (Lucan Harriers) will both race the 800m, with Gemma Galvin (Ennis Track AC), who made the national senior 800m final last weekend, opting to focus on the women’s 1,500m. The men’s 400m heats are part of the opening session on Thursday morning. Men Dubem Amah (Tallaght AC) 200m & 4x100m; Conor Kelly (Finn Valley AC) 400m & 4x400m; Seán Doggett (Athenry AC) 400m & 4x400m; Alex Cullen (Kilkenny City Harriers) 400m & 4x400m; Ethan Dewhirst (Tir Chonaill AC) 400mH & 4x400m; Oisín Lynch (Killarney Valley AC) 800m; Seán Cronin (Clonliffe Harriers) 1,500m; Frank Buchanan (St Michael’s, Enniskillen) 1,500m; Cormac Dixon (Tallaght AC) 3,000m & 5,000m; Cillian Gleeson (Celbridge AC) 3,000m & 5,000m; Séamus Clarke (Moy Valley AC) 10km walk; Cian Crampton (Edenderry AC) Discus; Theo Hanlon (Suncroft AC) Shot Put; Jesse Osas (Ratoath AC) 4x100m; Luke Timlin (Crusaders AC) 4x100m; Joe Burke (Templemore AC) 4x100m; Ben Sykes (Orangegrove AC) 4x100m; Cillian Doherty (Crusaders AC) 4x100m non-travelling reserve; David Davitt (Clonliffe Harriers) 4x400m; Andrew Hayes (Dundrum South Dublin AC) 4x400m; Christopher Lynch (Clonliffe Harriers) 4x400m.

Title: July earnings update: Boeing, UnitedHealth Group, Starbucks, Coca-Cola and BlackRock

Let CFO.com's free newsletter keep you informed, straight from your inbox. Cathy Smith of Starbucks talks long-term cost structure, John Murphy of Coca-Cola focuses on margin expansion and Kim Kuryea of General Dynamics highlights record backlog and cash flow. Earnings calls, loved by some CFOs and dreaded by others, allow finance leaders and their fellow executives to verbalize their organization’s progress. Each month, CFO.com compiles interesting insights shared by CFOs during these calls for The CFO Earnings Dispatch series. These insights include statements about their company, analysis of financial data and answers to analysts’ questions. For July, we highlight CFO comments from Boeing, UnitedHealth Group, General Dynamics, Starbucks, The Cheesecake Factory, Tractor Supply, Coca-Cola and BlackRock. Market Cap: $170.53 billion Date of Call: July 29 Boeing’s recent financial performance shows how CFOs can stabilize operations and narrow losses during challenging times by leaning on delivery execution and steady working capital improvements. In his final earnings call in the position, CFO Brian West said free cash flow usage of $200 million in Q2 was significantly better than expected, driven by 150 commercial deliveries that included 13 777 jets, nearly double the usual volume. West projected approximately $3 billion in free cash flow for the year, assuming no major disruptions. The company also held firm on its strategy to reintegrate Spirit AeroSystems and normalize inventory as production stabilizes. "Margins at [Boeing Commercial Airplanes] were negative 6.6% in Q1, improved to negative 5.1% in Q2 and we expect to continue improving quarter by quarter, although still negative for the year," West said. "Long term, there's nothing we see that would suggest we can't get back to historical margin levels." Market Cap: $224.32 billion Date of Call: July 29 UnitedHealth Group is adjusting expectations for 2025 as elevated medical costs, exchange-related headwinds and slower OptumHealth growth weigh on results. Outgoing CFO John Rex reported Q2 adjusted earnings per share of $4.08, down from the prior year, and revised full-year guidance to at least $16 per share. The updated outlook includes $1.6 billion in potential settlement items, with $600 million recognized in Q2 and another $1 billion anticipated. Rex noted a full-year medical care ratio of 89.25%, up from the previously forecasted 86.5%, driven by higher patient morbidity in Affordable Care Act exchanges and changes tied to Medicare and the Inflation Reduction Act. "As we look toward 2026 and beyond, we expect efforts underway to steadily improve our performance," Rex said, pointing to renewed focus on pricing, operational discipline and longer-term investment in AI and modernization. Market Cap: $101.46 billion Date of Call: July 29 Starbucks CFO Cathy Smith said the company is focused on building a more durable cost structure to support its long-term turnaround. Four months into the role, Smith said the company is investing in foundational changes, including a $500 million labor investment while working across the P&L to find efficiencies. “We are, as we shared even last quarter, working across the entire P&L,” Smith said. “From cost of goods sold to operating expenses to G&A, the team is taking on both short-term and long-term cost structure efficiency work.” She emphasized the importance of building sustainability into the turnaround. “We’re working on 2026, 2027 and 2028,” she said. “We’re putting in the more durable sustainable activities to make sure we don’t just address it once, but we actually address it long term.” Smith said the company is focused on setting the foundation for future earnings growth. “What’s really exciting though is when we start to grow, we’ll actually like what comes through to the bottom line.” Market Cap: $3.09 billion Date of Call: July 29 Matthew Clark, CFO of Cheesecake Factory, said stable consumer trends and execution across concepts supported margin gains and stronger-than-expected results in the second quarter. Revenue reached $956 million with an adjusted net income margin of 5.8%, exceeding the company’s guidance range. Clark highlighted improved labor productivity, lower commodity costs and disciplined pricing as key drivers of margin performance. “We feel really good about where we’re sitting today,” Clark said. “The environment has been very, very steady for us… and I think it’s a testament to our execution as well as the brands that we have.” The company plans to open up to 25 new restaurants this year across its Cheesecake Factory, North Italia, Flower Child and other Fox Restaurants concepts. Clark said Flower Child, the company’s health-forward fast-casual concept, is delivering mature unit margins of 20.4%, with average unit volume approaching $5 million and returns in the mid-30% range. North Italia locations are also performing well, with new units opening above expectations and mature margins reaching 18.2%. Clark noted menu pricing will decline in the second half, driven by new lower-priced offerings. “The real pricing is probably going to be more like 2% to 2.5% in terms of what the consumer feels,” he said, emphasizing the company’s focus on perceived value and traffic recovery. Market Cap: $31.87 billion Date of Call: July 24 Kurt Barton, CFO of Tractor Supply, said the company delivered record sales and net income in Q2, with signs of momentum continuing into the back half of the year. Comps were positive across six of seven regions, and June saw gains in all regions, supported by a delayed but accelerated spring selling season. “We see demand solid. Our customers [are] in a strong position,” Barton said. “The expectation for the second half of the year would be balanced between both ticket and transactions.” Gross margin expanded by 31 basis points to 36.9%, aided by product cost management and efficiencies across the supply chain. Barton said tariff impacts have begun to flow through direct imports and will create modest pressure in the second half, though average unit retail has not yet been materially affected. “We believe we can still maintain even at these elevated comps… the operating margin rate that we gave in our guide,” he said. The company returned $196 million to shareholders in the quarter and reduced its full-year repurchase outlook, citing a “more measured pace” of capital deployment. Barton said Tractor Supply remains focused on expense control, with selling, general and administrative expenses expected to ease in the second half. Market Cap: $84.92 billion Date of Call: July 23 General Dynamics reported strong order activity and cash performance in the second quarter, with record backlog and improved free cash flow conversion. CFO Kim Kuryea said the company booked $28 billion in orders, resulting in a company-wide book-to-bill ratio of 2.2, led by marine systems. Aerospace also reported a 1.3x book-to-bill despite increased aircraft deliveries. Backlog reached a record $103.7 billion, up 14% from a year ago, with total estimated contract value exceeding $160 billion. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $1.6 billion, with free cash flow of $1.4 billion and a cash conversion rate of 138%. The company expects full-year conversion to be approximately 90%, with the majority of cash generation in the fourth quarter. Kuryea noted full-year cash projections do not yet include potential benefits from recent tax legislation reversing the amortization of R&D expenses, which may provide additional cash flow depending on timing. Capital expenditures were $198 million, or 1.5% of sales, with full-year capex expected to be slightly above 2% of sales. The company paid $402 million in dividends, did not repurchase shares during the quarter, and reduced net debt by $1.2 billion to $7.2 billion. Interest expense is projected to be $330 million for the full year. Market Cap: $299.88 billion Date of Call: July 22 Coca-Cola CFO John Murphy said the company delivered strong margin expansion and free cash flow growth in the second quarter, even as unit case volume declined 1% due to soft June results. Organic revenue grew 5%, driven by price/mix gains, while comparable gross margin expanded by 80 basis points and operating margin rose 190 basis points. “We expect to deliver operating leverage in the second half of the year, albeit at a slightly lower rate than we had previously flagged,” Murphy said. He added that about one-third of the company’s underlying margin expansion came from faster realization of productivity initiatives. While the company reaffirmed its full-year guidance of 5% to 6% organic revenue growth, it now expects comparable EPS to grow 3%, down slightly due to a five-point currency headwind. Murphy said Coca-Cola plans to use its strong first-half performance to “invest some of our efficiencies” into growth for the back half of the year. He noted the updated outlook reflects a softening of earlier currency-related pressure and that Coca-Cola would provide more detail on 2026 in its October call. Though not addressed on the earnings call, the company has separately indicated plans to begin using cane sugar in U.S. beverages, a potential shift with implications for costs, marketing and consumer preferences. Market Cap: $182.97 billion Date of Call: July 15 BlackRock and its CFO Martin Small reported 6% organic base fee growth in Q2 2025, marking the company’s fourth consecutive quarter above 5%. Assets under management are also at a record $12.5 trillion. Net inflows totaled $116 billion, excluding a $52 billion institutional index redemption. Small said the firm is seeing sustained growth across ETFs, its investment technology platform Aladdin, cash management, private markets and digital assets. The acquisition of HPS Investment Partners added $165 billion of AUM and is expected to contribute $450 million in revenue in Q3. Preqin added $60 million to Q2 technology services revenue. Subscription revenue rose 26% year-over-year. Small said the firm remains on track toward its goal of $400 billion in private market fundraising between 2025 and 2030. Operating margin declined 80 basis points to 43.3%, mainly due to lower performance fees and acquisition-related expenses. Small said controllable expenses are aligned with revenue growth and that recent acquisitions are expected to be self-funding. Dividend growth is expected to track operating and net income as part of BlackRock’s 2030 strategy. Get the free daily newsletter with financial industry insights and practical advice for CFOs.

Title: Why BlackRock’s 2.5K BTC and 101K ETH sell-off has traders on edge
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/why-blackrocks-2-5k-btc-and-101k-eth-sell-off-has-traders-on-edge/

Is BlackRock selling or preparing for something else entirely? BlackRock has transferred large amounts of BTC and ETH to Coinbase amid significant outflows from its crypto ETFs, sparking sell-off concerns. In a surprising move that has stirred fresh speculation in the crypto market, BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, appears to be unloading a portion of its Bitcoin [BTC] and Ethereum [ETH] holdings tied to its crypto ETFs. According to blockchain data from Arkham Intelligence, BlackRock transferred 2,544 BTC and 101,975 ETH to Coinbase Prime on the 5th of August. Such transfers are often interpreted as precursors to redemptions, especially when investor sentiment turns cautious. Naturally, these transfers coincided with noticeable outflows from BlackRock’s ETFs on the 4th of August. According to SosSo Value data, BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF, IBIT, recorded a significant net outflow of $292.21 million, while its Ethereum counterpart, ETHA, witnessed an even higher outflow of $374.97 million. However, despite the large-scale redemptions, ETHA still managed to increase its Ethereum holdings to a value of around $9.3 billion, bringing its total net assets to approximately $10.7 billion. The outflow-inflow dynamics also shifted slightly on the 5th of August. While IBIT recorded another $77.42 million in outflows, ETHA saw a turnaround with $88.8 million in net inflows, according to Farside data. Importantly, not all these movements may translate to direct market selling. Since the SEC approved in-kind redemptions for crypto ETFs, firms like BlackRock can redeem ETF shares for actual crypto, reducing pressure on spot prices. This reduces the need to liquidate positions into cash, offering a more crypto-native mechanism for handling redemptions. Meanwhile, at the time of the sell-off, Ethereum was trading around the $3,700 mark. However, as of the latest data from CoinMarketCap, ETH has slipped to $3,637.32, at press time, reflecting a 0.76% decline in the past 24 hours. Bitcoin also saw a modest drop, trading at $114,145.54, down 0.22% over the same period. These shifts align with broader market jitters, which appear to have been sparked by a recent hawkish Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) report. The report noted, “Inflation remains somewhat elevated.” As expected, this had signaled the potential for sustained high interest rates, prompting U.S. investors to adopt a risk-off approach and potentially triggering the outflows observed from BlackRock’s crypto ETFs.

Data from SoSoValue shows sell-offs across all U.S. funds tracking Bitcoin's spot price hit a total of $196.18 million on Tuesday. However, this is less severe than in recent days. Outflows stood at $333.19 million on Monday, while Friday's figure of $812.25 million was the second-highest since these products launched back in January 2024. Altogether, the four days of outflows have meant a net loss of $1.4 billion for Bitcoin funds. It comes as Donald Trump ramps up the rhetoric on tariffs once again, with threats of fresh levies on India, as well as imported pharmaceutical products and semiconductors. The renewed threat of trade wars has fueled risk-off sentiment among investors, with growing economic uncertainty prompting many to seek safer ground. Bitcoin is holding steady at $114,000 at the time of writing—relatively flat over the past 24 hours—but has fallen by 2.8% over the past week. According to SoSoValue, the picture looks slightly rosier when it comes to the Ethereum ETFs trading on Wall Street. Funds tracking the spot price of the world's second-largest cryptocurrency actually saw inflows of $73.3 million on Tuesday. That snapped a two-day losing streak, with outflows of $465 million and $152 million on Monday and Friday respectively. Prior to that, ETF ETFs had enjoyed inflows for 20 days on the bounce, driven by a dramatic surge in price. Analysts are suggesting that the arrival of ETFs has had a significant impact on Bitcoin's volatility. Bloomberg's Eric Balchunas recently argued that BTC has jumped by 250% since BlackRock's initial filing for the iShares Bitcoin Trust, but without "vomit-inducing drawdowns." This guy gets it. We’ve been saying same thing. Since BlackRock filing Bitcoin is up like 250% with much less volatility and no vomit-inducing drawdowns. This has helped it attract even bigger fish and gives it fighting chance to be adopted as currency. Downside is prob no more… https://t.co/0ECd5XevcO — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) July 26, 2025 On X, he argued the absence of volatility has both pros and cons. "This has helped it attract even bigger fish and gives it fighting chance to be adopted as currency," he wrote. "Downside is prob no more God Candles. Can’t have it all!"

Title: Apollo buys majority stake in Stream Data Centers

Business AI (Artificial Intelligence) letters are placed on computer motherboard in this illustration taken, June 23, 2023. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration NEW YORK : Apollo agreed to buy a majority interest in Stream Data Centers (SDC), the alternative asset manager said on Wednesday, in a bet on rising demand for digital infrastructure fueled by artificial intelligence and cloud computing. Big Tech companies and outside investors are pouring money into data centers as demand for computing power soars.

Title: ‘Defending Paradise’: Julia Louis-Dreyfus Takes on Big Oil in California
URL: http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/julia-louis-dreyfus-oil-offshore-drilling-exxon-california-1235400793/
Time Published: 2025-08-06T12:00:00Z
Full Content:
By Antonia Juhasz Julia Louis-Dreyfus has three words for the nation’s political elite: “Grow a set.” The acclaimed actress is best known for playing iconic women, from Elaine Benes in Seinfeld, to Vice President Selina Meyer in Veep, and diabolical CIA director Valentina Allegra de Fontaine in the new Avengers movie, Thunderbolts*. Louis-Dreyfus is also a longtime environmental and political activist. She has made it her personal mission to get California Governor Gavin Newsom, President Donald Trump, and every other political leader she can wrangle to understand that oil drilling is for suckers — and protecting our climate and the economies that thrive off of a healthy and sustainable environment is the stuff of true patriotism. It is not always an easy sell. Seated in her Santa Barbara, California, home with her dog Georgie vying for her attention — I fail to ask if he’s named after that George — it is clear that Louis-Dreyfus is pissed off. “The idea of this decrepit pipeline that failed so miserably and catastrophically a decade ago, the idea of that restarting is an impossible thing to contemplate, and it really has to be fought,” she tells me via Zoom. A decade ago, one of the worst oil disasters in California’s history occurred not far from Louis-Dreyfus’ home. On May 19, 2015, a massive, corroded oil pipeline ruptured, releasing 140,000 gallons of heavy crude oil onto Santa Barbara’s Refugio State Beach. Oil poured into one of the most biologically rich areas of the Pacific Ocean, a key habitat for endangered whales and sea turtles, sea otters, sharks, and more than 500 fish species. It was carried down the coast past Los Angeles, oiling 150 miles of beaches and coastline. In June 2015, I walked the beach at the Santa Monica pier, 100 miles from Refugio. A fresh line of thick and pungent oil tar balls — some as large as a hand — lined the sand along the tideline, with new oil from the spill deposited with incoming waves. The spill devastated fisheries, tourism, and areas sacred to the native Chumash peoples. Then-Governor Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency, deploying the state’s Attorney General Kamala Harris. Editor’s picks The 250 Greatest Albums of the 21st Century So Far The 100 Best TV Episodes of All Time The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time 100 Best Movies of the 21st Century The oil came from ExxonMobil’s offshore operations. For 10 years, the people of Santa Barbara have successfully kept ExxonMobil from restarting those operations, including the ruptured pipeline. Resistance has been led by Louis-Dreyfus’ friend and ally, Linda Krop, chief counsel of Santa Barbara’s small but mighty Environmental Defense Center. I first interviewed Krop in 2015 just after the spill. She described watching aghast, the stench nauseating, as thick heavy waves of oil filled the ocean and poured onto Refugio Beach. “I’ve never seen anything like it,” she told me. “It was just devastating.” Last month, Krop and I walked along the same stretch of beach. Children played in the ocean and teenagers took surfing lessons, enjoying a healthy and beautiful shoreline. Krop is committed to keeping it this way. For 10 years, Krop and her allies have beaten ExxonMobil in the state legislature, the federal government, and in court battles stretching all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. “This project is the single largest threat to California’s coast,” Krop tells me.

Website ‘Glitch’ Removes Trump's Least Favorite Part of Constitution But now the entire project is poised to restart, with both state and federal agencies granting many of the necessary permits. It is fronted by a new company funded and backed by ExxonMobil — Sable Offshore Oil Corp, which is behaving with what many here describe as a “Trumpian” and “unprecedented” disdain for the law, under the hopeful eyes and dedicated support of the Trump administration. It would be the first newly started oil development off California’s coast in decades, and the single largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the county. The project could also usher in Trump’s plan to open the entire Pacific coast (and nearly all federal waters) to oil and gas drilling. “President Trump made it clear that American energy should come from American resources,” Trump’s Interior Department said in a statement last week, crowing that “we’ve turned a decade-long shutdown into a comeback story for Pacific production.” In response to detailed questions, an ExxonMobil spokesperson says that the company completed the sale of these operations with Sable more than a year ago, and passed me off to Sable for additional information. Louis-Dreyfus and Krop are committed to stopping Trump. They are also clear that the final say on Sable’s project ultimately rests not with Trump but with Newsom, who they argue is failing to act. “He has an opportunity right now to do the right thing,” Louis-Dreyfus says of the governor. “This is far from over.” On March 13, Louis-Dreyfus joined legendary actress and activist Jane Fonda for a press conference at the Environmental Defense Center in opposition to Sable’s project. Louis-Dreyfus then addressed a packed house of more than 500 people who filled the La Cumbre Junior High School in Santa Barbara for a town hall on Sable. Louis-Dreyfus and Krop were the final speakers, following presentations by representatives from nine state agencies with jurisdiction over Sable’s project. Krop warmly introduced Louis-Dreyfus as a “local shero” and “a champion of fighting the fossil fuel industry and trying to protect the climate, our way of life, and a clean and healthy environment.” Louis-Dreyfus has a decades-long history of environmental and political activism. For her podcast, Wiser Than Me — just named one of the best podcasts of all time by TIME magazine — she interviews older women, including giants like labor leader Dolores Huerta, conservationist Jane Goodall, and acclaimed marine biologist Sylvia Earle, who are “brimming with the kind of unapologetic attitude and wisdom that only comes with age.” She was a staunch supporter of both Hillary Clinton and Kamala Harris’ presidential campaigns against Trump. Last year, she moderated a forum of Democratic women governors and introduced the event as “what J.D. Vance might call a coven of semi-menstruating witches.” But for Louis-Dreyfus, the fight against Sable is uniquely personal. Her husband was born and raised in Santa Barbara, where his family has lived for generations. Her family previously split their time between Santa Barbara and Los Angeles, but that was before their L.A. home was destroyed in the Palisades fire early this year. “The climate crisis is obviously real and upon us — it’s not coming, we’re living it right now. That was certainly felt by me during these devastating fires,” Louis-Dreyfus tells me. “Santa Barbara is a paradise worth defending and protecting,” she adds, explaining that the risk of this oil project “is very close to home… and something that is not possible to turn my back on.” Louis-Dreyfus looked resolved as she approached the podium, scanning the sea of bright red T-shirts worn by the project’s opponents reading, “Don’t Enable Sable,” and the hundreds of competing hats emblazoned with Sable’s logo that were worn by the pipeline’s supporters. Confronting the obvious tension in the room, she leaned into the mic, stared down the audience, and said, “I smell a rat.” “I am here because I’m a resident of Santa Barbara County,” she began. “And this project is a rat.” She pulled no punches, describing the pipeline 10 years ago as “crap” and the people responsible for supervising it as irresponsible. “Thankfully, the whole decrepit thing was shut down,” she said. “But now, Sable Oil from Texas is trying to restart the very same, dangerously inadequate pipeline that ruptured. And incredibly, they’re trying to do it with zero environmental review and zero opportunity for public input. That is insane. It makes me furious. I know it makes you furious.” She called the project a catastrophe waiting to happen. As Louis-Dreyfus spoke, the audience erupted in applause and hoots of support, though there were some jeers and boos, too. The Sable supporters then rose and began filing out of the auditorium en masse. Unfazed, she continued on, calling out Sable for ignoring cease-and-desist orders issued by the California Coastal Commission and for behaving as “an incompetent operator trying to grease the wheels of government.” She declared, “We’re not going to let this happen without a fight,” adding: “I will certainly fight for my home.” “Sable Offshore management, employees, contractors, labor and supporters showed up today in good faith to participate in a town hall meeting where only government officials were on the agenda to present,” Sable vice president, Steve Rusch, told the Santa Barbara news outlet Noozhawk. “Project opponents forced the moderators to give them dedicated time to present biased information and smear the project. The opponents’ self-serving fundraiser and rally was not an appropriate use of public resources.” Louis-Dreyfus later tells me that she was surprised when Sable’s supporters walked out on her, and she wishes they’d stayed. “I was speaking truth to power pretty forcefully… and so they got pissed off,” she says. “I felt emboldened by it, to be honest. It was fuel, the good kind of fuel.” Krop says that Louis-Dreyfus’ speech was significant to those in the audience. “You could feel it in the room,” she said. “It was the kind of support people needed to hear.” Krop has spent the better part of the last 40 years at the Environmental Defense Center. Working with a team of just 11 full-time staff, she has relentlessly and successfully gone head-to-head against the world’s largest corporations, cutting Exxon off in every effort to restart its Santa Barbara operations, and helping create some of the nation’s most powerful environmental and public health laws as a result. The nation’s first offshore oil drilling began in Santa Barbara in 1896. In 1969, it was also the site of what remains one of the nation’s worst oil disasters, when a blown-out well operated by Union Oil Company released 3 million gallons of oil into the ocean. The Environmental Defense Center was one of many local organizations born in the aftermath to protect the community from fossil fuels. Under the banner “Get Oil Out!” local organizers spawned a wave of activism credited with birthing the national environmental movement and achieving a series of legislative victories, including the federal National Environmental Policy Act of 1970 and the California Coastal Act of 1976. They quickly won a ban on any new offshore oil and gas leasing or drilling in California state waters. In 1982, Congress followed suit, implementing a series of similar moratoria primarily off the Pacific and Atlantic coasts. Despite Congress and President George W. Bush allowing the federal moratoria to expire in 2008, no new fossil fuel leases have been granted in state or federal waters outside of the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska in decades due to staunch public opposition. The offshore oil and gas operations taking place today off the Pacific coast — all of which are offshore California — were grandfathered in; they were already underway when the bans and moratoria were imposed and were allowed to continue. “No one ever dreamed that they would still be here today,” Krop tells me. The oil from the existing operations was expected to quickly dry up. Instead, the companies developed new techniques to keep their grandfathered operations running decades longer than anyone anticipated. ExxonMobil signed its first lease for the Santa Ynez Unit offshore Santa Barbara in 1968 and began production in 1981. Santa Ynez includes three platforms in federal waters named Harmony, Heritage, and Hondo, supported by pipelines that connect the platforms to shore and on to the Los Flores Canyon Processing Plant. ExxonMobil was able to greatly extend the life of its grandfathered platforms using drilling technologies learned from its operations in Russia, according to a 2010 ExxonMobil press release. It achieved “the world’s longest extended-reach well” at Santa Ynez, extending over six miles horizontally and more than 7,000 feet below sea level. Horizontal drilling is a technique used in fracking, using water and chemicals to blast open rock to release oil and gas. ExxonMobil revealed in a 2017 court filing that the Santa Ynez wells also require acid well stimulation treatments to keep producing; acidization uses acid to dissolve the rock. Both techniques release toxic chemicals into the environment that are harmful to humans and wildlife. In 2022, the Environmental Defense Center and the Center for Biological Diversity won a lawsuit, begun nearly a decade earlier, that effectively bans fracking and acidizing from offshore oil and gas wells in the Pacific Ocean. The U.S. Supreme Court rejected a plea from ExxonMobil the following year to review the case, allowing the ban to stand. At the time of the 2015 oil spill, ExxonMobil’s oil and gas was carried from the Las Flores Canyon Processing Plant along the Pacific Coast Highway in an underground pipeline that was owned and operated by the Plains All American Pipeline company. When this pipeline ruptured, the oil entered a culvert which carried it directly into the Pacific Ocean and onto Refugio Beach. Federal regulators found that Plains had allowed the pipeline to corrode to such an extent that the thickness was reduced in places from 24 inches to just 1/16 of an inch. California’s then-Attorney General Kamala Harris secured a grand jury indictment of Plains on 46 criminal charges, including four felonies. The Department of Transportation ordered the pipeline shut down, which is how it has remained ever since. Without the pipeline, ExxonMobil had no way to carry its oil to buyers and thus had no way to sell it, forcing the company to also halt production from its offshore oil and gas wells. ExxonMobil spent nearly a decade trying to secure permission to move the oil by truck, ultimately losing (again) to Krop. Companies are also barred from using tankers to move their oil offshore California. During his first administration, Trump tried and failed to open virtually all federal waters to offshore oil and gas drilling. Under pressure from the fossil fuel industry — led by its largest lobbying group, the American Petroleum Institute — he’s now trying to do it again. “You cannot make offshore oil safe, and the Trump administration is trying to ramrod more offshore oil down our throats,” Krop tells me. Back in 2018, Krop helped secure state legislation prohibiting California from issuing new leases for any oil or gas-related infrastructure such as pipelines in the state’s coastal waters that would support federal operations, which also cut ExxonMobil off from building new pipelines to carry its oil to shore somewhere else. The state has also taken additional actions against ExxonMobil. In 2023, Newsom sued ExxonMobil along with Chevron, BP, Shell, ConocoPhillips, Phillips 66, and the American Petroleum Institute, accusing the fossil fuel industry of lying to the public for decades about its products’ central role driving the climate crisis, and demanding payment for the resulting harm. Newsom is also suing ExxonMobil for engaging in a decades-long campaign of deception that caused and exacerbated the global plastics pollution crisis. ExxonMobil is counter-suing California and several environmental organizations for allegedly “engaging in a deliberate smear campaign” by conspiring to defame the company. Not long after the climate suit was launched, ExxonMobil announced its intention to exit California and promptly sold its onshore operations. Ditching its California holdings could potentially shield ExxonMobil from the state attempting to seize Exxon’s assets if California wins its climate suit and if Exxon were to refuse to pay any resulting damages. Announcing its departure meant that Exxon could no longer count the value of its offshore oil and gas leases as part of its reported earnings. In 2023, it had to take a $3.4 billion earnings cut due to its idled Santa Ynez Unit (the entirety of its offshore California holdings). Selling the operations removes this loss from Exxon’s balance sheet. In 2024, Exxon financed the sale of its Santa Ynez operations and all related onshore facilities, including the ruptured pipeline, to Sable Offshore Oil Corporation. Exxon loaned Sable $623 million, nearly the entire amount required to fund the sale. Though the sale is complete, the handover is not. Exxon and Sable are currently suing Santa Barbara County for its refusal to transfer certain permits from Exxon to Sable. But, other than its gas stations, ExxonMobil now has no remaining significant holdings in California. ExxonMobil is likely playing the long game. While the company is for all intents and purposes being forced out of California, it also has an obsequious and acquiescent ally in Trump and his administration, which is simultaneously trying to undermine and undo climate and environmental actions taken by the state. Trump’s efforts are expected to cost American jobs and increase energy prices for consumers, including significantly raising gas prices at the pump. “Sable is ruthless, they are absolutely horrible,” Mia Lopez tells me. Lopez is a member of the Coastal Band of the Chumash Nation, the first human inhabitants of the Central Coast of California. Refugio State Park is located near the original site of the historic Chumash village of Qasil. Just three days before the 2015 oil spill, Lopez was elected chair of her tribe. “It was so devastating, to our land, our sites, the ocean, the artifacts, so many things that were damaged,” Lopez tells me, pain gripping her face. “It affected our relatives in the ocean, so many birds, seals, dolphins, and whales. That’s my community. Those are my relatives. That’s who I became responsible for.” Lopez stepped down as chair in 2021, but explains, “I just realized there’s no way I can ever step away from this fight against the oil.” She has helped lead efforts to hold the companies accountable and keep the projects from reopening ever since. “They have proven from the moment they stepped in that they are untrustworthy. They have blatantly disregarded laws and regulations,” Lopez says of Sable. Sable Offshore Oil Corp. was formed in 2021 by a group of men who have worked together for years heading small oil and gas companies, including companies with ties to the Santa Barbara oil spill. Santa Ynez is Sable’s only operation — and the only operation ever undertaken by the company. James Flores is chairman and CEO (his son is president of the company). Flores’ previous company, Sable Permian Resources, filed for bankruptcy in 2020 (recovering the following year). From 2001 to 2013, Flores served as the chairman and CEO of Plains Resources, Inc., a company formed in 2001 when it broke off from Plains All American Pipeline (the owner and operator of the failed pipeline found guilty of causing the 2015 oil spill). Flores also served as chairman and CEO of Freeport-McMoRan Oil & Gas, which currently operates several inactive platforms off of Santa Barbara’s coast. Sable is in a race against time: Exxon gave Sable just two years to either pay back its entire loan with interest or give back the assets. “It doesn’t have time to get a whole new pipeline approved and built, so it aggressively pursued restart of the old, corroded pipeline,” Krop explains. “No one thought this pipeline would ever be used again.” Sable immediately set to work, receiving permits from state and federal agencies, but without a key permit from the California Coastal Commission, an independent state regulator established under the California Coastal Act. Sable contends that it does not need the permit; the commission asserts that it does. The two sides are currently fighting it out in court, with a hearing set for October. The commission has issued several cease-and-desist orders, which Sable ignored, and leveled an $18 million fine, the largest in its history, alleging months of illegal violations of the Coastal Act. “This is the first time in the agency’s history that we’ve had a party blatantly ignore a cease-and-desist order,” Cassidy Teufel, deputy director of the California Coastal Commission, said at the March town hall at which Louis-Dreyfus also spoke. “Sable representatives have told us that they’ll only stop if a court makes them.” Louis-Dreyfus sees Sable as following the Trump playbook. “Following the rule of law all of a sudden seems to be up for grabs, and our country is based on rule of law,” she says. Teufel said that Sable has identified more than 100 locations where the pipeline was defective that are within the coastal commission’s auspices. The company brought in heavy equipment to excavate, destroying and disrupting sensitive habitats and protected areas, including federally designated critical habitat for wildlife protected under the Endangered Species Act, and within sensitive stream corridors and wetlands, all without a permit and in apparent violation of the law, he said. Lopez watched in anguish as the work unfolded, taking place 24 hours a day, seven days a week, primarily carried out by hundreds of temporary contractors. Sable has just 161 employees, none of whom are unionized. “They did not have permission to dig in our lands. They did not have permission to dig up our sites. They did it under the cover of darkness. They did it without seeking the proper permits,” she tells me. “I watched them dig, and there was nothing we could do about it.” In response to questions from Rolling Stone, Sable shared a statement from its vice president, Rusch, asserting that the company’s work to “ensure the safe condition of the pipeline” was “fully authorized by coastal development permits” and accusing the commission of exaggerating the project’s impact, “which were de minimis thanks to Sable’s implementation of best management practices.” The company further states that it “implemented several construction best practices to limit impacts” to coastal, biological, and archaeological resources. “The project is supported by employees, small businesses and community leaders like the tribal leader of the Coastal Band of the Chumash Nation,” Sable spokesperson Alice Walton wrote in the email, attaching a statement written in October by then-tribal chief, Gabriel Dominguez Frausto. Walton did not mention that this statement was promptly voided by the Tribal Council and Frausto was forced to resign, having “overstepped his authority by responding without Tribal Council or membership approval.” In a subsequent letter, the new tribal chief and the Tribal Council stated their “unequivocal opposition” to the project, “and to any further or continued oil development on our homelands and within our coastal waters.” On May 19, the 10-year anniversary of the oil spill, Sable announced that it had restarted production at Santa Ynez, completed its repair program on the onshore pipeline, and expected to “recommence oil sales in July.” A class action lawsuit alleges that Sable committed securities fraud or other unlawful business practices based on these claims, misleading investors to inflate its stock price just before a major stock offering. It cites the California State Lands Commission, which says that Sable conflated offshore well testing with the restart of operations, appearing to “mischaracterize the nature of recent activities, causing significant public confusion and raising questions regarding Sable’s intentions.” In the strongly worded letter, commission chair and Lieutenant Governor Eleni Kounalakis accused Sable of a willful disregard for the directives of state regulatory agencies and threatened to withhold its leases, calling the company “Exxon’s designated operator.” A few days later, the Superior Court of Santa Barbara sided with the Coastal Commission and ordered Sable to stop any further coastal work until it obtains the necessary permits. Despite these warnings and several ongoing legal battles, in Sable’s most recent filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on July 11, the company said that it continues to produce from the Santa Ynez Unit, anticipates receiving approval to restart the pipeline, and would begin selling oil on August 1 (it has not). Six days after the filing, hedge fund Encompass Capital Advisors announced its purchase of over 5.2 million shares of Sable, representing over 5.2 percent of the company’s stock. In June, BlackRock Inc., the world’s largest asset manager, reported acquiring over 5 million shares of Sable, representing 5 percent of its stock, according to an SEC filing. Sable has not and cannot restart the pipeline until it receives final approval from state and federal regulators. It did not answer questions from Rolling Stone as to whether it has secured buyers for its oil if the pipeline does restart. Sable has also gone on offense, hiring Exxon’s lobbying firm, Crossroads Strategies, to lobby the federal government and Platinum Advisors to lobby in Sacramento. Platinum’s clients include the California Business Roundtable and the Plastics Industry Association, as well as progressive groups, including the SAG-AFTRA actors union. Krop is suing on several fronts, including charging state regulators with illegally issuing a key waiver to Sable. She and Louis-Dreyfus are also calling on Newsom to put a halt to Sable’s project once and for all. “He has an opportunity right now to do the right thing,” Louis-Dreyfus says. She applauds Newsom’s forceful response when Trump sent the National Guard and Marines into Los Angeles. “I’m hoping that the same speaking-truth-to-power that he exhibited then will now be applied to this fight.” “The governor’s office could have prevented all of this,” Professor Paasha Mahdavi, Director of the Energy Governance and Political Economy Lab at the University of California in Santa Barbara, tells me. “Newsom’s office could have just killed this upfront.” Governor Newsom declined a request for an interview. In an emailed statement, a Newsom spokesperson says, “While some offshore drilling continues in federal waters under longstanding federal leases, the governor remains unwavering in his commitment: no new offshore drilling — period.” The governor’s office stresses the necessity of allowing the legal and regulatory process to play out. It disputes Sable’s predictions of a rapid completion timeline, instead asserting that any conclusion is likely far off given multiple barriers in the regulatory landscape to Sable restarting the pipeline, including in the coastal commission’s case. Newsom has taken an aggressive stand against Trump, including the administration’s efforts to open all federal waters to offshore oil and gas drilling. Trump’s Department of Transportation has also recently proposed weakening federal oil and gas pipeline safety regulations and speeding up approvals for new pipelines. Many fear that allowing Sable to restart Exxon’s offshore operations will provide Trump with the opening his administration is looking for to assert that Californians support and even condone offshore drilling, and that the door should be open for more. Krop wants Newsom to publicly oppose Sable’s project, citing the risks of another massive oil spill and climate change. She wants him to commit state agencies to conducting environmental reviews and public hearings. “We’re at the tail end of this project potentially being approved and given the green light,” Krop warns. “It’s time for Newsom to act.” Trending Stories BET Hip Hop Awards and Soul Train Music Awards Have Been ‘Suspended’ Indefinitely Treasury Secretary Admits Trump’s Tariffs Are Paid by Americans How ‘Clanker’ Became the Internet’s New Favorite Slur A Complete Timeline of the Right Claiming Sydney Sweeney Louis-Dreyfus joined what was likely the largest protest in Santa Barbara’s history in June as more than 10,000 people participated in the No Kings national day of protest against Trump.

ByBilly Bambrough ByBilly Bambrough, Senior Contributor. Bitcoin has limped into August following a sudden sell-off that even a jaw-dropping intervention by legendary billionaire Ray Dalio couldn’t reverse. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has fallen under $112,000 per bitcoin this last week, down from a peak of $123,000 in July (though traders are bracing for a fresh BlackRock earthquake). Now, as fears swirl around the future of the U.S. dollar, bitcoin and crypto traders have been warned the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) newly unveiled “Project Crypto” isn’t priced in.

It was written by the chairman of the SEC," Matt Hougan, the chief investment officer of Bitwise, wrote in a note posted to X after SEC chair Paul Atkins published a speech he gave on July 31 at the America First Policy Institute about how crypto will be integrated into the financial markets. “I was caught off-guard by the speech," Hougan wrote, adding: "I can’t imagine reading the speech and not wanting to allocate a significant portion of your capital to crypto. If it wasn’t priced in for me, I’m going to guess it wasn’t priced in for others.” The bitcoin price had already surged following the resignation of former SEC chair Gary Gensler in January, climbing again when Atkins was sworn in by U.S. president Donald Trump in April. Last week, Atkins, picked by Trump to replace the crypto critic Gensler, unveiled Project Crypto, a radical plan to carve out a niche for crypto in U.S. securities laws and embed blockchain technology into the financial system. The SEC’s new Project Crypto initiative marks the "boldest and the most transformative crypto vision ever laid out by a sitting SEC chair," analysts at research and brokerage company Bernstein wrote in a note seen by The Block. "As Atkins puts it, the winds of change are blowing," Bernstein’s Gautam Chhugani wrote. "In our view, Project Crypto upends the concept of a regulatory moat in capital markets, allowing equal opportunity to new players to participate and innovate in security markets. It is time to upgrade the financial system from online to onchain." Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free newsletter for the crypto-curious In the speech, titled "American Leadership in the Digital Finance Revolution: Evolution of Capital Markets—From Buttonwood to Blockchain," Atkins claimed U.S. financial regulation must evolve or risk being left behind. “That is why I am launching Project Crypto and directing the SEC’s policy divisions to work with the Crypto Task Force, led by Commissioner Peirce, to swiftly develop proposals to implement the [President’s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets] recommendations," Atkins said. “Project Crypto will help ensure that the United States remains the best place in the world to start a business, develop cutting-edge technologies, and participate in capital markets. We will reshore the crypto businesses that fled our country, particularly those that were crippled by the previous administration’s regulation-by-enforcement crusade and 'Operation Chokepoint 2.0.’ Whether an incumbent or a new entrant, the SEC welcomes all market participants who are hungry to innovate.” Crypto companies began complaining of banks withholding services from them in a way that felt like it was coordinated in 2022. Nic Carter, a crypto venture capitalist, then coined the term Operation Choke Point 2.0, referring to an Obama administration clandestine operation to debank undesirable industries including firearms dealers and payday lenders in the early 2010s. Since retaking the White House, Trump—who has fully embraced bitcoin and crypto over the last year—has promised to dismantle Biden-era restrictions of crypto markets and companies, calling himself the first “crypto president.”
