Title: Finn McRedmond: Forget VAT. Delivery apps are killing our restaurants

Call the social scientists. I propose a new method for tracking the social health of society and it’s called The Takeaway Index. It suggests that the moral status of the nation is tightly correlated with the amount of time we spend ordering food via apps on our smartphones. I think it stands up against accepted scientific methods. This is, conveniently, rather good news for me. I have ordered just one takeaway in 2025. It was Monday, June 30th. I had returned from Glastonbury after a seven-hour trip home, husk-like, to an empty fridge. I scrolled through Uber Eats and ordered chicken, broccoli and some pickled cabbage, in repentance for the hedonism of recent days. I felt immediate guilt, not because it was going to be disgusting, but because I know delivery apps are wreaking havoc on the restaurant industry. Forgive the moralising (it’s just dinner), but your beloved local trattoria’s life depends on it. In the first quarter of 2025, 150 restaurants in Ireland closed. Six-hundred restaurants, cafes and hospitality businesses closed in the 12 months from September, 2023. This is a crisis and if the impersonal data doesn’t do it for you, then look to your main street. Near to where I grew up, Gareth Smith’s restaurant, Big Mike’s (in Blackrock, Co Dublin), has been forced to shutter. The economics of the industry are “insurmountable”, he explained. Allow me to acknowledge the cost-of-living crisis and all the hardship it places on the consumer. Regular dinner out is an extravagance beyond many. A fish pie for €20 is not trivial pocket change. With that out of the way, now turn your eyes to this staggering figure reported by RTÉ this summer: we spend €2.2 billion a year on takeaways. Restaurants are caught in a nasty doom loop. They were once reliant on the likes of Uber Eats or Deliveroo to survive, but those are now among the factors making brick-and-mortar restaurants less viable. There are other things at play of course, but this part of the story is too often overlooked. During the pandemic, restaurants relied on these delivery apps to reach their customers. It was a vicious cycle; customers became too used to takeaways and restaurants grew too reliant on takeaway apps. Now, in 2025, not enough people are eating out. Or, as UCC professor Ronan Carbery puts it in a piece for RTÉ, “delivery platforms transformed from pandemic lifelines into structural threats”. The Government is listening. Tuesday’s budget announced VAT on “food businesses” will reduce from 13.5 per cent to 9 per cent from next summer. This might dig hospitality out of the grave, but only if those in search of dinner are willing to give up their Uber Eats account too. “It’s actually much more complicated than that.” These are the words I hear from the more annoying among you. Isn’t single-cause history out of fashion? All well and good, but this is not about the multifaceted source of hospitality’s malaise. Rising wages, cost of produce, hostile rental markets – these are all problems too. But what we are witnessing beyond the economic analysis is a much more troubling directional trend. And we have always been able to learn a lot about the world by looking at how it decides to eat. Last I heard, society is more atomised than ever – polarised, miserable, with nasty populists in the wings and surrounded by a truculent electorate. The isolating power of the smartphone turns out to be even greater than we ever imagined – as young people in particular while away their hours, and thus their lives, scrolling through endless amounts of slop. This radicalises some and makes loners out of others. Meanwhile, everyone wants to sit inside and order a pizza to their front door from an app. Breaking bread might be the most ancient practice, slowly being lost to the lure of the smartphone. Ordering food off an app is a symptom of this bigger sickness. Just like the decline in shared community activities like sports teams and bridge clubs, the retreat inside to eat dinner on the sofa is part of this social atomisation. But it is a cause of the isolating spiral too. As fewer people want to be – or can afford to be – in shared places like restaurants, is it any wonder that everyone has forgotten what is nice about it in the first place? This is a self-sustaining crash-out. I’ve glanced into the future and it is a grim place where the dimly-lit wine bar serving pan-European small plates is closed. Also closed are the robust kitchens serving trad-hibernian fare, the seafood bars on Dublin’s south coast and West Cork’s shores. We have ceded our appetites to middlemen at Silicon Valley mega-corps. We demand lunch in a box handed to us by a low-wage gig-economy worker. All the while the local restaurant was just around the corner, begging for your custom. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Elm Park offices present opportunity for offices and healthcare investors
URL: https://www.independent.ie/business/commercial-property/elm-park-offices-present-opportunity-for-offices-and-healthcare-investors/a1420248835.html

Block A at Elm Park With office deals increasing in both the lettings and sales markets, the launch of Block A at Elm Park, Dublin 4, along with the adjoining annex, presents an interesting opportunity for investors and owner occupiers. It also reflects how keen pricing has become for Dublin offices. Agent TWM is guiding in the region of €18.5m for the entire block which is equivalent to €1,744 per square metre – whereas to develop the same block at current prices could cost more than double that, at €4,198 per square metre. Block A is a modern seven-storey office building extending to about 72,000sqft with an adjoining smaller building known as the annex, extending to about 10,000sqft. The sale includes 76 secure basement car spaces. Currently the lot generates annual rent of €1.32m and there is potential to increase that by letting out two vacant floors extending to 29,000sqft which can be accessed via individual entrances. Strategic risk management firms Willis Towers Watson has a lease on four floors accounting for 60pc of the building and they are paying about €1.2m in rent. Recent figures for the Dublin office market saw increased activity when 822,000sqft of office space was leased across 61 deals during the three months to the end of September. That was the highest number of transactions in a quarter since the third quarter of 2018. Recovery in office demand was also reflected in the investment market, where offices accounted for 35pc of deal volume, across 12 deals. Michele Jackson of TWM also says Elm Park could also appeal to purchasers and occupiers in the healthcare sector, partly because its basement is built to double height level, which is designed to accommodate ambulances. “The 2024 strategic acquisition by the HSE of its Elm Park Green portfolio for approximately €50m is understood to have triggered a broader interest in this location from investors seeking a value add/alternative use play as well as from the immediate healthcare sector.” The HSE acquisition comprised 275,000sqft of accommodation across two buildings which included the vacant Seamark building, extending to approximately 180,000sqft. The acquisition will support cost-effective and expedient delivery of healthcare accommodation in line with the most recent Programme for Government. Elm Park is a prime Dublin 4 location adjacent to St Vincent’s public and private hospitals and 2kms from Blackrock Health. The development has generous secure basement parking and easy access to bus and Dart public transport. Ms Jackson says that “The location is likely to appeal to both investors and owner occupiers looking to buy into sectors poised for growth.” Join the Irish Independent WhatsApp channel Stay up to date with all the latest news

Title: Commentary: Is Hong Kong’s comeback for the world or for China?

Commentary As China prepares for a key meeting to discuss its next five-year plan, repositioning Hong Kong must take focus, says former SCMP editor-in-chief Wang Xiangwei. File photo of people crossing a street during busy evening traffic in Central Hong Kong. (Photo: AFP/Mladen Antonov) This audio is generated by an AI tool. HONG KONG: Just a few years ago, many outsiders had written Hong Kong off. The violent protests of 2019, followed by the imposition of a national security law in 2020 and strict COVID-19 restrictions, triggered a mass exodus of local and foreign talent and capital. Professionals and firms fled to safer havens like Singapore, while others sought refuge in New York and London, leaving the city economically battered and demographically hollowed out. Yet, in a striking turnaround, Hong Kong is staging a robust comeback - albeit one fraught with inconsistencies. The city's stock markets have surged back to prominence, fuelled by Beijing's economic stimulus measures unveiled in September 2024. In the first half of 2025 alone, the city raised HK$107.1 billion (US$13.7 billion) through initial public offerings (IPOs) - seven times the amount from the same period in 2024. PwC forecasts that 2025 will mark Hong Kong's most active IPO market in four years, with fundraising expected to claim the global number one spot. Much of this momentum is being driven by mainland Chinese firms, which account for around 60 per cent of the over 2,600 companies listed in Hong Kong, as well as more than 80 per cent of total market capitalisation. Government incentives have also drawn hundreds of thousands of Chinese talents from the mainland and overseas. The latest vindication came last month when Hong Kong supplanted Singapore as Asia's premier destination for attracting talent and rocketed to fourth place worldwide in the IMD World Talent Ranking - its highest-ever position. This resurgence, however, feels lopsided on the ground. The streets are bustling, and the vibrancy is unmistakable. Tourism footfall is up, especially from mainland China, which accounted for nearly 80 per cent of Hong Kong’s visitor arrivals between January and August. But boarded-up storefronts tell another story. High rents and competition from cheaper cross-border alternatives have hit parts of the retail and restaurant segments hard, even as other sectors, for example jewellery and watches typically favoured by tourists - thrive. Beneath this uneven recovery looms a larger, strategic question: Is Hong Kong rebounding to reclaim its cherished mantle as Asia's World City - a cosmopolitan powerhouse akin to New York or London - or is it morphing into China's World City, a specialised outpost serving the mainland's ambitions? The answer will dictate everything from investment flows and urban planning to cultural identity and global relevance. Since 2001, Hong Kong has leaned heavily into its "Asia's World City" branding, spotlighting its prowess in financial services, trade, tourism, transport and communications. This narrative positioned the city as a vibrant, rule-of-law bastion bridging East and West. But the past five years have upended that vision, amid escalating US-China tensions. Perceptions have shifted dramatically; serious doubts now swirl about whether Hong Kong is devolving into "just another Chinese city". This unease stems partly from the territory's political elite, who have increasingly embraced mainland-style rhetoric and governance practices. Over the last two years, Beijing has exhorted the city to prioritise economic growth, leveraging its unique perch as a capitalist enclave under the "one country, two systems" framework. Yet Hong Kong grapples with striking a delicate equilibrium between security and development, and between deeper integration into the mainland economy and its role as a regional hub for international business. Recent flashpoints underscore the tension. In March 2025, state-backed media unleashed blistering criticism against tycoon Li Ka-shing's CK Hutchison Holdings for its plan to sell strategic Panama Canal ports to a consortium led by US financial behemoth BlackRock, branding the move a "betrayal" and "spineless capitulation". Similarly, early this month, Beijing's top diplomat in Hong Kong warned the newly arrived US Consul General Julie Eadeh against "colluding with anti-China forces", after she met with local civil society figures. Contrary to fears that Hong Kong would be collateral damage in the US-China showdown, its liminal "in-between" status is proving a surprising asset. The mainland stimulus not only juiced stocks but also amplified Hong Kong's appeal as a conduit for global capital into China. Looking ahead, the city stands to gain from cross-border talent flows. In the US, President Donald Trump's aggressive crackdown on elite universities like Harvard and restrictions on foreign scholars have unnerved Chinese students and scientists, many of whom view Hong Kong as a lifeline. Its capitalist ethos, English common law, and open access to Western platforms like Google and Facebook, which are banned on the mainland, make it an alluring alternative. Beijing's blessings have supercharged this trend. Hong Kong's talent admission schemes, offering low taxes and top-tier international schools, have magnetised mainland professionals eager for global exposure while securing better futures for their children. Since 2022, these programmes have fielded nearly 500,000 applications, approving over 330,000 and welcoming more than 230,000 arrivals. The government's back-patting as an "international talent hub" rings somewhat hollow though, as the vast majority hail from the mainland, raising eyebrows about diversity and true global pull. These newcomers will undoubtedly invigorate the economy, restoring the frenetic energy of old. But they also fuel anxieties over whether Hong Kong can preserve its status as an international business nexus amid ballooning geopolitical friction. Officials have pivoted toward forging economic ties with Middle Eastern powerhouses and Belt and Road Initiative partners, with Dubai and Qatar emerging as favoured haunts. This shift isn't whimsical: US sanctions on senior figures, including Hong Kong Chief Executive John Lee, have hamstrung outreach to traditional business partners like the US, UK, and Europe, forcing a reorientation. The result? Apprehensions that Hong Kong is settling for a diminished role - a regional player on par with Dubai - rather than reclaiming its perch as a global financial titan rivalling New York and London. As China's leaders convene imminently to chart the 2026-2030 Five-Year Plan against a backdrop of roiling geopolitics, repositioning Hong Kong must rise to the fore. It needs to make the city indispensable to China’s modernisation and equally indispensable to global capital seeking exposure to China and Asia. To deliver that dual indispensability, Hong Kong must navigate these currents with nuance - honouring Beijing's directives while safeguarding the openness that once defined it as Asia's unrivalled world city.

Title: Think tank founder faces scrutiny over China corporate ties despite decoupling advocacy

Republican strategist Katie Zacharia joins 'America's Newsroom' to discuss President Donald Trump's negotiations with China on trade, tariffs and the framework for a TikTok sale. Oren Cass, founder of the Washington-based think tank American Compass, has built a reputation as one of the right’s most outspoken advocates for economic nationalism and "strategic decoupling" from Beijing. Yet recent details about the group’s corporate partnerships and staff affiliations raise questions about consistency between its rhetoric and its operations. In essays and media appearances, Cass has argued that the United States must take a tougher stance toward China and prioritize domestic manufacturing and independence from Chinese supply chains. In a 2023 Foreign Affairs essay, Cass and a colleague warned that the U.S. "must break from China or else become irrevocably corrupted by it," arguing that economic interdependence had already "weakened America’s industrial base and constrained its political will." MAJOR COLLEGES FACE HEAT OVER CHINESE SCHOLARSHIP TIES AS ESPIONAGE CONCERNS MOUNT Oren Cass has become (Dominic Gwinn/Middle East Images/AFP/Getty Images) In the same essay, Cass and his co-author argued that China’s influence extended deep into U.S. research and policy institutions. "China has long targeted U.S. universities, think tanks and research institutes to extract economic gain and advance its own ideological agenda," they wrote, adding that such organizations "must accept processes and controls designed to ensure the integrity and security of their work." They went further, calling for legal restrictions. "U.S. law should be changed to prohibit these institutions from entering into any partnerships with China-based and affiliated entities. Any funding flowing from one nation's institutions to the other's must be stopped." Lawmakers from both parties have long raised concerns that the Chinese government exploits educational exchanges, research partnerships and business investments in the U.S. as cover for espionage activities. These warnings have intensified in recent years amid growing scrutiny of Beijing’s influence operations on U.S. soil. The national flags of the United States and China flutter at the Fairmont Peace Hotel on April 25, 2024 in Shanghai, China. (Photo by Wang Gang/VCG via Getty Images) On July 28, 2025, Cass joined a group of policymakers and national security experts in a letter to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick expressing "deep concern" over the decision to resume exports of Nvidia’s H20 chips to China. The group warned that the Trump administration’s move "represents a strategic misstep that endangers the United States’ economic and military edge in artificial intelligence." He reiterated his stance during a conversation on Steve Bannon’s "War Room" podcast where he argued against lifting export restrictions on advanced computer chips bound for China. CHINA'S MALIGN INFLUENCE TOUCHES EVERY ASPECT OF US LIFE. WE ALL NEED TO HELP STOP THEM And yet, Cass’s uncompromising rhetoric on China appears at odds with the realities of operating a Washington think tank in a globalized economy. In June 2025, American Compass hosted a lavish fifth-anniversary gala at Washington’s National Building Museum, an event underwritten in part by Qualcomm, BlackRock, and Google — companies whose global operations remain deeply intertwined with China’s economy.

(Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images) China is the world’s second-largest economy and a key trading partner for U.S. companies, making such financial entanglements common across Washington’s policy landscape. Fox News Digital reached out to Qualcomm, BlackRock and Google for comment; none responded before publication. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP What's more, American Compass’s staffing and advisory relationships have also prompted questions. The organization’s director of events and operations previously worked for Alibaba Group, one of China’s largest tech companies. Additionally, an economist on the group’s advisory board is also a professor at Peking University’s Guanghua School of Management, a leading business institution with close ties to China's Communist Party. Cass and American Compass did not return multiple requests for comment from Fox News Digital. While none of these associations are illegal or unusual in Washington, they complicate Cass’ image as a champion of economic separation from China and highlight the difficulty of pursuing that ideal while relying on corporate sponsors.

Title: Spiritans to sell Tipperary farm to fund compensation for abuse survivors

The Spiritan order is to sell one of the biggest farms in Co Tipperary as part of its pledge to compensate victims of abuse. The 765-acre Rockwell Farm will be sold on the open market and is likely to fetch at least €20 million, according to industry sources. The land was used for an agricultural college until the 1980s and is now a dairy farm with up to 650 cows. By November of last year, 359 survivors of abuse at Spiritan schools had come forward, including 347 disclosed in the scoping inquiry report on abuse at private fee-paying schools published in September 2024. The schools involved were Blackrock College, its feeder junior school Willow Park, Rockwell College, St Mary’s College, St Michael’s College and Templeogue College. In a statement, Spiritans provincial Fr Brendan Carr said the order had been upfront about not having the cash to compensate victims and would instead need to sell assets. He said the order had been “fully transparent about their financial position” from the beginning. “Progress is being made and Rockwell Farm will be the first of these properties to be sold, but this involves multiple legal, valuation and regulatory steps that simply take time to complete.” He added that as a registered charitable organisation, the Spiritans are subject to the oversight of the Charities Regulator and subject to audit. The order also felt a need “to respond clearly to the suggestion that the Spiritans are deliberately delaying or obstructing progress”. Last Friday, the order was accused of adding to the suffering of the survivors by missing the deadline given last June in announcing a redress scheme. The Spiritans had not provided any such update at the end of summer, the Restore Together group said, and had been seeking a meeting with the order ever since. Responding on Wednesday, Fr Carr said “a commitment was made” but “progress has not been as fast as anyone would wish”. [ Spiritans commit to redress scheme for school abuse survivors in attempt to ‘offer atonement’Opens in new window ] Fr Carr acknowledged “the immense urgency that victims and survivors feel. We feel it too.” He added: “We continue to meet regularly with survivors and to provide ongoing counselling and restorative meetings facilitated by the independent restorative justice team. These encounters are deeply important to us and they continue to shape how we respond and plan.” He appealed “for understanding as we continue to navigate these complex financial and legal steps”. Fr Carr said: “We will provide a further public update as soon as key transactions are concluded and timelines can be confirmed with confidence.” The value of Co Tipperary land was brought into focus during a recent legal action involving billionaire businessman John Magnier. Mr Magnier lost a case at the Commercial Court claiming a verbal agreement to buy the 751-acre Barne Estate amounted to a sale. He agreed a price of €15 million with the owner Richard Thomson-Moore in August 2023, but eventually lost out to New York-based businessman Maurice Regan who agreed to buy the estate for €22.5 million.

Title: How Has The BlackRock Bitcoin ETF Fared Compared To Its Older Funds?

Time Published: 2025-10-08T19:00:41Z

Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas has highlighted how the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) has performed in comparison to the world’s largest asset manager’s older funds. This comes as the fund approaches the $100 billion milestone, which will make it the fastest to reach this milestone. In an X post, Balchunas revealed that the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF, which is approaching $100 billion, is now the most profitable fund for the asset manager by a “good amount.” The Bloomberg analyst also highlighted that this is a massive feat for the Bitcoin fund, considering its age in comparison to the other funds. The BlackRock Bitcoin ETF, which was launched last year, is currently generating an annual revenue of $244.5 million for the world’s largest asset manager. This is well ahead of BlackRock’s Russell 1000 Growth ETF, which is 25 years old and generates an annual revenue of $219.3 million, placing it in second place. Notably, the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF is the only fund on the list that has a single-digit age. The other of BlackRock’s funds are 12 years and above. Eric Balchunas also noted that IBIT was approaching $100 billion in assets under management (AuM), which could make it the fastest to reach this milestone. The Bloomberg analyst revealed that the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF currently holds this record, although it achieved this feat in 2,011 days. Meanwhile, the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF, which is just 437 days old, currently has $99.44 billion in assets under management, putting it on track to surpass this record by a considerable margin. This comes as the BlackRock BTC ETF continues to lead the pack, with massive daily net inflows. On October 6, these Bitcoin funds saw $1.19 billion in daily net inflows, with IBIT accounting $970 million of these flows. Meanwhile, they recorded a daily net inflow of $875.6 million yesterday, with IBIT accounting for $899.4 million of these flows. Eric Balchunas also revealed that the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF is now in the top 20 in ETF assets following the rapid increase in its AuM. Based on its current AuM, IBIT is 19th on the list of largest ETFs, just ahead of Vanguard’s VIG and the “legendary” Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund. The Bloomberg analyst remarked that if the last 12 months are repeated, it may not take too long for the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF to break into the top 10. He noted that the fund took in $40 billion over the last 12 months and saw an 85% increase. He added that he will put the timeline at December 2026 if he has to give one. At the time of writing, the BTC price is trading at around $121,500, down over 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: Jury told Quilligan subjected to a violent assault
URL: https://www.rte.ie/news/courts/2025/1008/1537523-kieran-quilligan-case/
Time Published: 2025-10-08T16:30:14Z
Full Content:
Jennie O\u0027Sullivan The jury in the trial of two men accused of the murder of Kieran Quilligan has been told that the 47-year-old had been subjected to a violent assault with a hammer-like weapon. Mr Quilligan's skeletal remains were found in a one-tonne gravel bag on scrub land near Rostellan in east Cork on 29 January last year, five months after he was first reported missing. Niall Long, 33, formerly of St Michael's Close, Mahon and 27-year-old Luke Taylor, formerly of Cherry Lawn, Blackrock in Cork city have both pleaded not guilty at the Central Criminal Court to murdering Mr Quilligan on dates unknown between 1 September 2023 and 29 January 2024, at an unknown location within the State in the district court of Cork city, contary to Common Law. On the opening day of the trial before Ms Justice Siobhan Lankford at the Central Criminal Court sitting in Cork, Prosecution Counsel Donal O'Sullivan SC told the jury of two women and ten men in his opening address that while the prosecution is not in a position to say who landed the blows, the allegation is that this was a joint enterprise where two people embarked on an enterprise to commit a murder. He said the jury would see alot of CCTV footage of both of the accused and alot of the evidence is circumstantial as there were no eye witnesses. He told jurors that Mr Quilligan was a user of the Simon Community and lived in an apartment provided by them. "He was someone who took drugs and was dealing drugs at the time. Niall Long (one of the co-accused) is someone who was a drug user and may have been dealing drugs as well," Mr O'Sullivan said. Mr O'Sullivan said on the morning of 1 September, Mr Quilligan and another man John Paul Thornton (known as 'Bubbles') robbed and assaulted Mr Long on York Hill. "It appears this is the instigating factor of what occured later that evening," Mr O'Sullivan said. It will be the State's case that at around 8pm that evening, the co-accused Luke Taylor was seen with Kieran Quilligan on CCTV leaving his apartment on Anderson's Quay and heading up along the quays towards St Finbarr's Cathedral. Two people in a house on St Finbarr's Place later reported hearing a violent altercation at around 9pm. Prosecution Counsel Donal O'Sullivan said CCTV will allegedly show a white Toyota RAV4 car registered to Niall Long's mother driving along Dean Street at the top of St Finbarr's Place. It will be claimed that the CCTV footage will show it reversing so that the boot of the car is facing down the lane at 9.05pm. Gardaí conducted a trawl of CCTV footage across Cork city and county and the same car was tracked going to a location in Little Island and afterwards dropping Mr Taylor off at an address at Jacob's Island. Mr O'Sullivan says Mr Quilligan was never seen alive again. He was reported missing on 4 September and a garda investigtion began. He said the jury would also see CCTV footage taken on 4 September which shows Mr Taylor being picked up from the Rochestown Park Hotel at 10.15pm by a white Toyota RAV4, which travelled to a number of locations in east Cork. On 29 January, a cadaver dog on scrubland at Whitewell, Rostellan, "reacts to an area below the road, wet and damp, not the sort of place anyone would be walking", Mr O'Sullivan said. There gardaí found a one-tonne gravel bag. Underneath it was a second bag inside which were skeletal human remains later identified as Kieran Quilligan's. Prosecution Counsel Donal O'Sullivan said post-mortem examination results revealed that while most of the soft tissue was gone, there was a large number of skeletal injuries. "This man was badly beaten. A weapon appears to have been used in the nature of a hammer," he said. "He met his death in a violent manner". Before his remains were found, a search was carried out on 15 September 2023 of Mr Long's home, and a car, as well as a bucket with cleaning products were seized. Blood was found, which matched to Kieran Quilligan. Concluding his opening address to the jury, Mr O'Sullivan said that "I don't have direct evidence, an eye witness saying I saw Niall Long or Luke Taylor beat him to death. I don't have that. "The case is for the most part circumstantial - a man goes missing on 1 September, found on 29 January, most likely he died on 1 September." The trial continues before Ms Justice Lankford, who indicated on Monday that it could last until the end of the month. © RTÉ 2025.

Global investment giants BlackRock and Brevan Howard have announced the launch of their tokenized funds on the Sei network, leveraging Kaios’s advanced infrastructure. Announced on October 8, 2025, the move highlights an accelerating institutional adoption of decentralized finance (DeFi) and real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. The debut introduces BlackRock’s BUIDL and Brevan Howard’s BH Digital Liquidity Fund to the Sei ecosystem, facilitated by Kaios’s institutional-grade platform. Conventional funds under this initiative are transformed into on-chain digital assets, enabling 24/7 compliance with DeFi protocols. BlackRock. Brevan Howard. Live on Sei. The most powerful names in global finance are coming to Sei via @KAIO_xyz — beginning with BlackRock's ICS US Dollar Liquidity Fund and Brevan Howard's Master Fund, now live. RWAs Move Faster on Sei. ($/acc) pic.twitter.com/fXaTgQvx1c — Sei (@SeiNetwork) October 8, 2025 Sei’s architecture ensures robust handling of high-volume transactions while maintaining enterprise-level security. Mr. Olivier Dang, COO of KAIO, commenting on the announcement “This launch marks another major milestone in institutional blockchain adoption. By using the Sei Network, we’re bringing composable access to leading fund strategies entirely onchain. It’s the foundation for real-time, programmable, financial infrastructure built for the next era of capital markets.” Justin Barlow, Executive Director at the Sei Development Foundation, in his statement, also stated, “The integration of KAIO’s onchain infrastructure with the Sei Network is another important step toward the goal for Sei to become the institutional settlement layer for all digital assets. Sei’s high-performance rails enable a seamless experience for trading money market funds onchain–one that is superior to the experience of trading those funds in the real world.” This collaboration addresses longstanding pain points in asset management, such as settlement delays and high costs. By embedding KYC/AML protocols and secure custody solutions, Kaios ensures regulatory alignment, paving the way for broader institutional inflows into tokenized RWAs. The debut of these high-profile funds is poised to catalyze demand for the SEI token. As institutional activity surges, network usage is expected to rise, enhancing SEI’s deflationary mechanics and staking yields. SEI is trading at near $0.28, with a 4% weekly loss amid broader crypto market profit taking. Short-term forecasts anticipate modest recovery, targeting $0.40-$0.50, bolstered by Sei’s growing network, partnerships. Medium-term outlooks predict SEI reaching $1, with the all-time high of $1.14 allowing for further upside. The price trajectory hinges on sustained partnerships and regulatory tailwinds like potential SEC approvals for staking yields. An $18 million token unlock is a challenge that could introduce supply pressure. Sei’s staking ratio and recent 50% weekly surges suggest resilience. This launch cements Sei’s role in institutional blockchain innovation, with SEI’s price outlook tilting positive amid heightened utility and capital inflows.

Title: The Protocol: 77% of Bitcoin Holders Have Never Used BTCFi, Survey Reveals

This article is featured in the latest issue of The Protocol, our weekly newsletter exploring the tech behind crypto, one block at a time. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday. Welcome to The Protocol, CoinDesk's weekly wrap of the most important stories in cryptocurrency tech development. I’m Margaux Nijkerk, a reporter at CoinDesk. In this issue: BITCOIN HOLDERS HESITANT TO EXPLORE BTC DEFI : Bitcoin decentralized finance (DeFi), also known as BTCFi, has been touted as the next wave of innovation for the world’s largest cryptocurrency. However, research suggests bitcoin holders themselves are barely engaging. Some 77% of bitcoin holders have never tried a BTCFi platform, according to a survey of more than 700 respondents across North America and Europe by BTC mining ecosystem GoMining. Just over 10% reported having experimented once or twice, while only 8% said they actively use BTCFi services for yield or lending. The survey highlights a stark disconnect between the sector’s promise and its actual reach. “There’s an enormous appetite for these opportunities, but the industry has built products for crypto natives, not for everyday bitcoin holders,” said GoMining CEO Mark Zalan in a statement. That appetite shows up in the data: 73% of respondents expressed interest in earning yield on their BTC through lending or staking, while 42% want access to liquidity without selling. Yet hesitation dominates. More than 40% said they would allocate less than 20% of their holdings to BTCFi products, underscoring the sector’s trust and complexity problem. — Jamie Crawley Read more. ETHEREUM FUSAKA UPGRADE ON HOLESKY TESTNET GOES LIVE: Ethereum’s next upgrade, Fusaka, just moved closer to going live on the main blockchain after a successful test run on the Holesky test network last week. The Fusaka hard fork comes only a few months after Ethereum’s major Pectra upgrade and is designed to make things cheaper for institutions using Ethereum. One of the changes it introduces is PeerDAS, a feature that lets validators check only part of the data needed instead of full chunks (“blobs”), which helps cut costs for both layer-2 networks and validators. Test networks like Holesky act as practice grounds where developers can safely test new code before it reaches the real chain. Holesky, launched in 2023, was particularly important because its validator setup closely mirrors Ethereum’s mainnet. But over the past few months, Holesky has started showing signs of age and reliability issues. Fusaka is the last upgrade the network will see before it shuts down — two weeks after Fusaka goes live on mainnet. The next two testnet runs are scheduled for October 14 and 28. After those are complete, Ethereum developers will lock in a date for Fusaka’s full mainnet launch. — Margaux Nijkerk Read more. DOUBLEZERO MAINNET GOES LIVE: A new project wants to give blockchains their own “fast lane” on the internet. The DoubleZero Foundation announced that its highly anticipated mainnet-beta is live. DoubleZero is a network built to speed up how blockchain validators talk to each other. Instead of relying on the public internet, which can sometimes be slow and unpredictable, Solana validators can now connect through DoubleZero’s fiber routes, which let users transact faster. In simple terms, DoubleZero is like a private highway system for blockchains. While normal internet routes are designed to be cheap and broad, they aren’t built for the split-second coordination thousands of blockchain nodes need. DoubleZero says its network reduces lag and makes it easier for validators to process transactions and stay in sync, which could improve both performance and reliability for end users. The project has already seen early adoption. When it went live, 22% of staked SOL is plugged into the DoubleZero network (as of publication is at 25%.) Big industry names like Jump Crypto, Galaxy, RockawayX, and Jito are contributing fiber links and engineering resources, betting that faster internet infrastructure will pay off as blockchain applications scale. — Margaux Nijkerk Read more. BEE MAPS RAISES $32M IN FUNDING ROUND: Bee Maps, the decentralized mapping project powered by Hivemapper, has raised $32 million in fresh funding to expand its global contributor network and scale its infrastructure, it announced this week. The round was led by Pantera Capital, LDA Capital, Borderless Capital and Ajna Capital, marking one of the largest financings in the decentralized physical infrastructure (DePin) sector this year. Bee Maps is an application on the Hivemapper network, which is one of the largest decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN) focused on mapping data on Solana. Hivemapper enables drivers to contribute data through AI-enabled dash cams, which detect real-time changes on roads (like new signs on the roads, detours, or construction zones), ensuring digital maps can update quickly to stay accurate. Bee Maps leverages this infrastructure by rewarding contributors with its native token, $HONEY, for collecting street-level imagery. The raise highlights strong investor appetite for Bee Maps’ vision of real-time, AI-powered maps. In recent months, Bee Maps has teamed up with major players including Lyft and Volkswagen’s robotaxi program to bring its mapping-data to their platforms. The fresh capital will be used to distribute more devices, enhance AI models that process and update map features and boost contributor incentives tied to $HONEY. – Margaux Nijkerk Read more. UPDATE (OCT 8., 20:12 UTC): Updated DoubleZero stake numbers.

Title: BlackRock dominates all ETFs with $3.5bn haul: ‘that’s how hungry the fish are’

Time Published: 2025-10-08T15:54:20Z

About us Copy link BlackRock investors are relentless. Larry Fink’s firm led exchange-traded fund flows across every sector last week, topping the list with $3.5 billion in flows into its Bitcoin ETF, IBIT. That’s 10% of all net inflows into ETFs. In second and third place came Vanguard and State Street. Their flagship S&P 500 trackers, SPLG and VOO, hauled in $2.4 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively. What’s impressive, however, is that both are getting lapped by a two-year-old. BlackRock’s IBIT has been around since January 2024, while Vanguard’s SPLG is 20 years old, and State Street’s VOO has been around for 15 years. Still, BlackRock wasn’t alone in its feeding frenzy. Every single Bitcoin ETF took in cash last week, with a total of 43,100 Bitcoin worth about $4.8 billion, according to Coinglass. “That’s how hungry the fish are,” said Eric Balchunas, a Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst. “Two steps forward mode. Enjoy while it lasts.” Moreover, flows into Bitcoin ETFs are nearly on par with 2024, with just under three months still to go. Year-to-date, inflows are now at $48.3 billion versus last year’s $48.5 billion, according to James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares. Since its inception, BlackRock Bitcoin investors have been insatiable. The fund is now nearing $100 billion in assets under management, making it the most profitable of all BlackRock ETFs. Loads of that capital comes from investors who had to wait a decade before the SEC greenlit a Bitcoin-linked exchange-traded product. Now that it’s here, almost two years in, investors can’t get enough of it. And lately, conditions have been favouring even more exposure to crypto’s top asset. The “sustained high appetite” is driven by several factors, Butterfill told DL News. For one, the Fed is starting to cut interest rates — which tends to favour risky assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum — while the US government shutdown is forcing investors to find protection. “The ongoing U.S. government shutdown impasse shows no clear path to resolution,” said Butterfill. “This increasingly projects an image of ineffectiveness and raises questions about US creditworthiness.” Off the back of BlackRock’s voracious appetite and the confluence of macro factors came a new all-time high for Bitcoin. The crypto topped $126,000 on Monday for the first time. BlackRock’s $3.5 billion intake is nothing short of impressive. Notably, that figure represents more capital than the entire crypto venture capital funding for the first quarter of 2024 by a wide margin. Back then, VCs ploughed just over $2.2 billion into crypto startups, according to DefiLlama. With some of the recent developments in corporate Bitcoin adoption, there are plenty more bullish signs flashing. Take crypto treasuries. They’re the firms that buy and hold tokens to bolster their balance sheets, hoping to ride the coattails of Bitcoin and Ethereum’s historic price appreciation. Currently, the top 100 Bitcoin treasuries hold approximately 1 million Bitcoin, valued at around $127 billion, according to BitcoinTreasuries.net. And that’s just Bitcoin. Ethereum treasuries have been even more aggressive than their Bitcoin counterparts, accumulating more than $25 billion in barely six months.

October 08, 2025 11:35 ET | Source: Primior Holdings Primior Holdings Irvine, California, Oct. 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Primior Holdings Inc. (OTC:GRLT), a Southern California–based real estate development and investment firm, today announced progress on its tokenization strategy led by its flagship platform, Gaia, and confirmed that Gaia is set to begin beta testing on November 1, 2025. Interested participants can join the waitlist now for early access and to be the first notified at primior.com/gaia. Tokenization—the representation of real-world assets on a digital ledger—is emerging as one of the most transformative trends in global finance. While institutions such as BlackRock are advancing tokenization of public assets like stocks and bonds, Gaia is positioning itself to lead in tokenizing private markets—including private equity, private credit, and real estate. By lowering barriers to entry and enabling more flexible investment structures, Gaia is designed to change how capital is raised across private markets. Mission-Aligned GrowthGaia’s mission is democratizing real estate investing for all. With global real estate estimated to exceed $600 trillion, even a 1% market share represents a $6 trillion opportunity. Gaia aims to lead the tokenization of real estate by improving access, liquidity, and efficiency for investors and sponsors alike. Development Platform: GP-Led Execution Backed by USP & Institutions Alongside Gaia’s progress, Primior’s development platform continues to advance substantial projects where Primior acts as the General Partner (GP) and is fully responsible for end-to-end execution—from site acquisition and entitlements through design, capital stack structuring, construction, lease-up, and asset management. The company is currently developing more than $100M in projects, which are capitalized by USP and other institutional investors. USP (United States Property) is Primior Group’s flagship tokenized real estate fund. USP is a security token representing ownership in the fund; holding USP provides exposure to a diversified portfolio of U.S. real estate. The development pipeline managed by Primior as GP supplies high-quality opportunities that can be aggregated and managed within tokenized structures like USP, aligning tangible assets with modern digital ownership rails. (No offer of securities is being made by this release; see “No Offer or Solicitation” below.) Primior Holdings Inc. is part of the broader Primior Group, which includes private affiliates in asset management, property management, and investment banking. These divisions provide depth and expertise across real estate, fund management, and financial advisory, further strengthening the credibility and execution capacity behind Primior Holdings’ public-market initiatives. “Our strategy with Gaia is clear,” said Johnney Zhang, Chairman and CEO of Primior Holdings. “We believe tokenization will fundamentally change how private equity and real estate are financed. Gaia is built to lead that change, creating investment opportunities that are more inclusive, transparent, and scalable than traditional models.” Corporate Update: Reverse Split & Capital Structure After careful consideration and in response to shareholder feedback, Primior Holdings will cancel the previously announced reverse split. In addition, the company plans to retire the outstanding note and convert it into preferred equity rather than common equity. Primior will provide a further update once additional information is available. About Primior Holdings Inc. (OTC:GRLT) Primior Holdings Inc. (OTC:GRLT) is a real estate development and investment firm headquartered in Irvine, California. The company is advancing next-generation financial solutions through Gaia, its proprietary tokenization platform for private equity and real estate.

Title: Top Altcoins to Watch as XRP Liquidations Shake the Market

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. A sudden 4,455% spike in $XRP’s hourly liquidation imbalance just wiped out $8.14M in bullish bets, and the market’s feeling it Coming right after $XRP briefly surpassed BlackRock in market cap, the drop shows just how fragile sentiment remains in Uptober’s volatile environment run. As risk-off sentiment spreads, some traders are already seeking the next breakout opportunities in top altcoins to buy, such as Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER), Maxi Doge ($MAXI), and Aster ($ASTER). $XRP’s recent move was a complete wipeout. According to Coinglass data, long positions fueled the liquidation imbalance, with bulls losing nearly $25M in 24 hours, including a single hour that wiped out $8.14M. The price drop knocked $XRP out of the top three cryptocurrencies by market cap, with $BNB reclaiming the spot after its own surge to new all-time highs. Investors who once bet on $XRP’s momentum toward its ATH of $3.66 are now watching confidence fade fast. This sudden correction highlights how quickly leverage can backfire on traders in a thin market. While $XRP bulls recover from losses, rotation is already underway. The focus is shifting toward trending cryptocurrencies showing real momentum and early upside potential. As $BTC stays strong above $122K, traders are shifting into ecosystems that expand Bitcoin’s utility, and Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is at the forefront. Bitcoin Hyper is a complete Layer 2 scaling solution powered by Solana’s Virtual Machine (SVM). In simple terms, it provides Bitcoin with what it’s always lacked – speed and low fees. That results in instant $BTC payments, DeFi applications, and even meme coins, all secured by Bitcoin’s main layer. Discover how to buy Bitcoin Hyper in our guide. Here’s how it works: you bridge your $BTC in, the system verifies it on-chain, then mints the same amount on Bitcoin Hyper’s network. Transactions run sub-second and near-zero cost before settling back to Bitcoin via zero-knowledge proofs. In a week where $XRP’s ‘utility’ narrative took a beating, $HYPER shows what real scalability looks like. Grab $HYPER before the next presale price jump. When blue-chip coins wobble, the best meme coins usually get their second wind, and Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is ready to flex. The ultra-ripped cousin of Dogecoin, Maxi Doge channels the degen bull run mindset with muscle, memes, and market discipline. $MAXI celebrates pure grind culture by never skipping leg day or a 1000x play. The branding is absurd, but it resonates strongly with traders who prioritize conviction and community over charts. With Dogecoin ($DOGE) up 136% in the past year, meme season’s clearly not over. Future tie-ins with leverage and trading platforms hint at deeper utility ahead, giving $MAXI more potential than most meme coins at launch. As traders de-risk from volatile majors like $XRP, meme-driven liquidity is already shifting toward community-first plays. Maxi Doge isn’t just a meme; it’s a lifestyle token designed for traders who thrive in a fast-paced environment. Join the $MAXI movement and embrace the grind – the charts don’t lift themselves. Following the chaos of $XRP’s liquidation, traders are rethinking where they park their leverage, and many are pivoting to on-chain solutions. Aster ($ASTER) is emerging as that safe haven: a next-gen decentralized exchange offering MEV-free perpetuals and spot trading across Ethereum, Solana, BNB Chain, and Arbitrum. Aster also allows users to post yield-bearing assets, such as $asBNB or $USDF, as collateral, thereby boosting capital efficiency for professional traders. The numbers speak for themselves – a $3.47B market cap, $1.49B 24-hour volume, and a 43% volume-to-market capitalization ratio, signaling extremely high attention. Aster’s roadmap also hints at cross-market integration, connecting crypto and traditional assets through stock perpetuals and hidden orders. This hybrid approach will position $ASTER as a full trading stack built for speed, privacy, and institutional-grade liquidity. Built on Aster Chain and backed by YZi Labs, the DEX delivers transparent governance – exactly what shaken traders are craving post-$XRP crash. Unlike $XRP’s centralized token dynamics, Aster thrives on openness, efficiency, and community-driven design. Buy $ASTER on Binance today. This article does not constitute financial advice.

Title: 2,700 Crypto Rigs Seized: Russia Launches Biggest Mining Raid Of The Year
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/2700-crypto-rigs-seized-russia-launches-biggest-mining-raid-of-the-year/
Time Published: 2025-10-08T15:30:41Z
Full Content:
According to reports, Russian police have seized around 2,700 crypto mining equipment from a site in St. Petersburg after a months-long probe into unusually low meter readings. The haul included banks of machines, fans and other cooling gear, and the authorities say they also took away two transformers. Investigators say the operation started after energy inspectors noticed inconsistencies between recorded meter figures and actual power use. The site had been connected to the grid since March 2018. It ran, according to officials, until August 2025. Police say three unnamed St. Petersburg residents had originally signed a contract to connect a commercial property to the grid more than seven years ago. Officers released video of the raid on a ministry Telegram channel. The footage shows police forcing open locked containers and pushing a man to the floor as they searched the premises. In one container, rows of active machines could be seen, with fans running and cooling systems in place. Other rooms held hundreds more rigs. Based on reports from the Interior Ministry, investigators believe the suspects used technical knowledge of the power grid to alter meter readings so the utility would show much lower consumption than was actually used. The suspects behind the illegal crypto mining rig operation were placed in custody and charged with causing “property damage by deception or abuse of trust,” prosecutors said. The ministry has not released an estimate of how much electricity was taken or the financial value of the theft. Officials also did not say which digital coins were being mined at the site. Police added they are still looking for possible accomplices linked to the operation. This seizure follows similar discoveries across Russia and territories under Moscow’s control. In mid-September, authorities uncovered an illegal cluster in what Moscow calls the Donetsk People’s Republic where operators had connected 25 rigs directly to the grid, bypassing meters. Officials reported damage estimated at 14 million rubles ($170,633) for that network. In other areas, hidden setups have appeared underground or inside trucks and vans. Regions mentioned by officials include Dagestan, parts of the North Caucasus and Southern Siberia — places where cheap or poorly monitored power has sometimes attracted clandestine miners.

Title: Man was murdered in Cork after carrying out robbery and assault, trial hears
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/crime-law/courts/2025/10/08/man-was-murdered-in-cork-after-carrying-out-robbery-and-assault-trial-hears/
Time Published: 2025-10-08T15:19:08Z
Full Content:
The murder of a man whose body was found months after he went missing had its origins in an assault and robbery he and another person committed, a jury has heard. Donal O’Sullivan SC, prosecuting, told jurors they will hear evidence how Mr Quilligan and another man had assaulted and robbed Niall Long off York Street in Cork city on September 1st, 2023. “This apparently was the instigating factor to what happened later,” Mr O’Sullivan told the Central Criminal Court sitting in Cork. Mr Long (33), of St Michael’s Close, Mahon, Cork, and Luke Taylor (27), formerly of Cherry Lawn, Blackrock, Cork, deny the murder of Mr Quilligan on a date unknown between September 1st, 2023, and January 29th last year. Mr O’Sullivan said the jury would hear Mr Quilligan (47) was a drug user and dealer and that Mr Long was a drug user and may also have been dealing drugs. After being assaulted on September 1st, Mr Long could be seen on CCTV around Cork city, while Mr Taylor could be seen on CCTV with Mr Quilligan some time before 9pm leaving Mr Quilligan’s flat in the Simon Community complex on Anderson’s Quay. Mr O’Sullivan said Mr Quilligan and Mr Taylor went up St Finbarr’s Place lane. Two people in a nearby house heard a “violent altercation” and called the guards, he said. He said a white Toyota Rav registered to Mr Long’s mother was reversed into the top of St Finbarr’s Place with the boot facing the lane. Neither Mr Quilligan nor Mr Taylor were seen on CCTV at the top of the lane before the car left the area. “Kieran Quilligan is never seen alive again,” Mr O’Sullivan said, saying gardaí tracked the vehicle to a farm at Little Island and then back to the city, where Mr Taylor is dropped off. Mr O’Sullivan said gardaí later became concerned about an area at Whitewell, Rostellan. With a cadaver dog, gardaí searched the area on January 29th last year and found skeletal remains in a gravel bag. Assistant State Pathologist Dr Margot Bolster established Mr Quilligan suffered bone injuries, but she could not determine a cause of death. Mr O’Sullivan said: “The man was beaten badly. A weapon in the nature of a hammer was used. He met in his end in a violent manner after a lot of bony injuries.” He told the jury of 10 men and two women how gardaí had months earlier searched Mr Long’s home and a vehicle and they had discovered a bucket with cleaning products found to contain blood matching Mr Quilligan’s. “I don’t have direct evidence. I don’t have witnesses saying, ‘I saw Luke Taylor and Niall Long beat him to death’. I don’t have that. The case is for the most part circumstantial: a man goes missing on September 1st, found on January 29th. Most likely he died on September 1st,” he said. The trial continues.

Title: Russell 2000 May Be the Hidden Compass for Ethereum’s Next Big Move | US Crypto News

Written byLockridge Okoth Edited byMohammad Shahid Welcome to the US Crypto News Morning Briefing—your essential rundown of the most important developments in crypto for the day ahead. Grab a coffee because markets are moving in strange harmony again. From small-cap stocks to Ethereum (ETH), patterns once thought unrelated are beginning to sync. While some call it a coincidence, others see a deeper signal about where risk capital is heading next as rate cuts loom. A striking correlation is emerging between the Russell 2000 and Ethereum, two very different risk assets that now appear to be moving in lockstep. Analysts at Milk Road highlighted the relationship, noting that both are hypersensitive to interest rate cuts and liquidity cycles. With markets pricing in four consecutive rate cuts through year-end, Milk Road says, “expect both of them to move up in tandem.” “This correlation is almost spooky. The Russell 2000 (small-cap equities) and ETH are basically moving in sync. Both are highly sensitive to interest rates. With 4+ consecutive cuts on the horizon… Expect both of them to move up in tandem,” they wrote. The pattern has been building since April, when the Russell 2000, an index tracking US small-cap stocks, began outperforming the broader market. It has gained over 42% since bottoming on April 7, outpacing the S&P 500’s 36% rise. The surge has coincided with renewed speculation, reported in a recent US Crypto News publication, that the Federal Reserve will continue cutting rates following its 25bps move on September 17. Traders assign over a 94.6% probability to another cut by late October. The parallel with Ethereum makes sense to macro traders as both assets thrive in risk-on environments fueled by cheaper capital. On the one hand, small-cap companies benefit directly from lower borrowing costs. On the other hand, Ethereum tends to attract liquidity inflows as investors rotate into growth and innovation-oriented risk assets during easing cycles. The Russell 2000’s tech sector hitting an all-time high is a milestone that some analysts like see as an early proxy for crypto market momentum. “Russell 2000 vs ETH Price. This is a fascinating combination of TradFi and crypto. Just as ETH acts as an index for Altcoins (smaller cryptocurrencies), the Russell 2000 represents small-cap stocks in traditional markets. It’s a correlation most traders overlook, yet it can reveal valuable insights about market risk cycles and investor appetite,” wrote analyst Joao Wedson, CEO and founder of Alphractal. However, not everyone is convinced that the small-cap rally or Ethereum’s correlation signals sustainable growth. Investor Oguz argues that small caps are dying, pointing to a decades-long trend of mega-cap dominance in digital and mobile-driven economies. “The internet and mobile have created winner-takes-all markets…Companies like Meta and Spotify become so large and profitable that they can leapfrog competitors across industries. This trend won’t reverse anytime soon. Long mega-caps,” he said. That view frames the concern that if the small-cap rally proves temporary, Ethereum could face similar cyclical headwinds as a proxy for decentralized innovation. Both ecosystems rely on broad-based risk appetite, not concentrated capital flows into giants like Apple or BlackRock. Still, near-term momentum remains undeniable. The Russell 2000’s five biggest holdings, including IonQ, Bloom Energy, and Kratos Defense, have rallied an average of 90% since August, despite many lacking consistent profitability. This surge, fueled by rate expectations and risk tolerance, mirrors Ethereum’s rally patterns during liquidity expansions. Perhaps the key distinction lies in structural utility. Unlike small caps, Ethereum is growing into a settlement layer for decentralized finance, tokenized assets, and smart contracts. This positions it for longer-term relevance even as small-cap equities fluctuate. Whether this correlation holds or diverges, both markets point to a restored risk appetite, with liquidity steering the narrative.

Title: Body of Kieran Quilligan found on Cork scrubland had injuries from hammer-like weapon, murder trial hears

Kieran Quilligan THE badly skeletonised body of a man was discovered in scrubland by Gardaí using a cadaver dog almost five months after he vanished with indications he had been subjected to a violent assault with a hammer-like weapon. Two men have denied the murder of Kieran Quilligan (47) whose skeletal remains were discovered in a one-tonne gravel bag in scrubland just off the Midleton-Rostellan road in east Cork in January 2024. Niall Long (33) and Luke Taylor (27) appeared before the Central Criminal Court, sitting in Cork, charged with the murder of Mr Quilligan. Both are charged with the murder of Mr Quilligan on a date unknown between September 1, 2023 and January 29, 2024 contrary to Common Law at an unknown location within the State. The two men entered not guilty pleas when arraigned before Ms Justice Siobhan Lankford and a jury of 10 men and two women. Long is formerly of St Michael's Close, Mahon, Cork Taylor is of no fixed abode and previously of Cherry Lawn, Blackrock, Cork. Ms Justice Lankford was told by Donal O'Sullivan SC, for the State, that the case is expected to last between three and four weeks. In opening the case, Mr O'Sullivan said the jury would effectively be dealing with two trials as the State will argue the two defendants were involved in a joint enterprise or common design. Mr O'Sullivan outlined the prosecution case but stressed that what he was saying was not evidence but merely what the State would argue. He said Mr Quilligan was a drug user and had availed of the services of Cork Simon. In September 2023, he was living in an apartment near Cork Simon Shelter with his partner. Mr O'Sullivan said the prosecution will argue that on the morning of September 1 2023, Mr Quilligan and another man, John Paul 'Bubbles' Thornton, went to a lane off York Street in Cork city centre. "They had an incident with Niall Long on the side street...they robbed him and assaulted him." Mr Quilligan then returned to his apartment. Mr O'Sullivan said that Mr Long was caught on CCTV security cameras moving around Cork city centre, going close to where Mr Quilligan lived. "It appears this is the instigation...for what occurs later." Mr O'Sullivan said that Mr Quilligan was later in company at his flat with Luke Taylor who was known to both the deceased and the other defendant. Both Mr Quilligan and Mr Taylor left the flat after 8pm and walked across Cork city centre to Proby's Quay near St Fin Barre's Cathedral. The movements of both are caught on CCTV security cameras. Both men walked off Proby's Quay and up a side street called St Finbarr's Place. However, CCTV footage never shows Mr Quilligan leaving the laneway. Mr O'Sullivan said cameras captured the movements of a white Toyota Rav4 car - which belonged to Mr Long's mother - driving from Mahon towards St Finbarr's Place. "The car reverses into the lane so the boot stays down the lane," Mr O'Sullivan added. "Two people living in a house hear a violent altercation and call the Gardaí. "After that, Kieran Quilligan is never seen alive again." Mr Quilligan was reported missing on September 4 by his partner and, after initially treating the matter as a missing person case, Gardaí became very concerned for Mr Quilligan's welfare. Gardaí conducted a trawl of CCTV security camera footage across Cork city and county. The white Toyota Rav4 is tracked driving to east Cork and then back to Cork city where Luke Taylor is dropped off at Jacob's Island near Mahon. Mr O'Sullivan said Gardaí ordered a search of an area off the roadway between Midleton and Rostellan on January 29 2024. Gardaí were assisted with their search by the deployment of a cadaver dog from Northern Ireland. The dog showed significant interest in an area well off the roadway by scrubland. Gardaí located a one-tonne gravel bag. Underneath it was a second bag which was found to contain skeletonised human remains. Both gravel bags appeared to have been taken from a local farmyard. "It was later identified Kieran Quilligan," he said. The remains were virtually skeletonised with little soft tissue remaining. No precise cause of death could be established after a post mortem by Assistant State Pathologist Dr Margaret Bolster at Cork University Hospital (CUH). However, Mr O'Sullivan said that Dr Bolster noted multiple injuries to Mr Quilligan's bones. "The man was badly beaten. A weapon appears to have been used in the nature of a hammer. "He met his death in a violent manner." Mr O'Sullivan said a search was ordered of Mr Long's home. In the course of that search, Garda seized a car as well as a bucket with cleaning products. "Blood was found. It was matched to Kieran Quilligan." Mr O'Sullivan said the prosecution case does not involve any direct evidence of what happened to Mr Quilligan but will revolve around circumstantial evidence. The trial will feature up to 126 witnesses and will also involve a substantial amount of CCTV security camera footage. Mr Long is represented by Ray Boland SC while Mr Taylor is represented by Brendan Grehan SC. The trial continues. Join the Irish Independent WhatsApp channel Stay up to date with all the latest news

Title: Brevan Howard-Backed Tokenization Firm Expands Funds to Sei as RWA Momentum Grows

KAIO, the tokenization firm backed by Brevan Howard and Nomura Bank's crypto-focused Laser Digital, is bringing its tokenized funds to the Sei network (SEI) as real-world asset demand is expanding. The firm, formerly known as Libre Capital, has issued over $200 million in assets, including token versions of feeder funds of Brevan Howard, Hamilton Lane, Laser Digital and a BlackRock funds, with plans to expand access to additional strategies. The tokens, available to institutional and accredited investors, allow for onchain subscription, redemption and reporting. The Sei Network, built for high-speed financial transactions, provides the underlying rails for execution. KAIO's expansion follows ARK-backed tokenization firm Securitize introducing the $112 million Apollo Diversified Credit Fund, a tokenized feeder fund of Apollo's private credit vehicle, to Sei. The announcement highlights a growing trend in tokenized real-world assets (RWAs), where traditional investments like bonds, credit and funds are represented as digital tokens. The process promises faster settlements, around-the-clock trading and potential to integrate with smart contracts and plug into decentralized finance (DeFi). Industry estimates project the total addressable market for tokenized RWAs in the trillions of dollars. With KAIO's integration with Sei, starting with tokens representing shares in the BlackRock ICS US Dollar Liquidity Fund and Brevan Howard Master Fund, will let investors use tokens within DeFi applications as collateral, liquidity reserves or yield-bearing assets, offering more flexibility in how institutional capital moves onchain. Justin Barlow, executive director of the Sei Development Foundation, framed Kaio's expansion as a key milestone for Sei toward its ambition to "become the institutional settlement layer for all digital assets." "By using the Sei Network, we’re bringing composable access to leading fund strategies entirely onchain," Olivier Dang, COO of KAIO, said in a statement. "It’s the foundation for real-time, programmable, financial infrastructure built for the next era of capital markets."

Title: Crypto ETFs seen to double by year-end as Bitcoin heads for $148,500

About us Copy link Crypto is heading into 2026 with a perfect mix of regulatory green lights, supportive monetary policies, and surging institutional demand. That’s according to a new CF Benchmarks report seen by DL News, which predicts that Bitcoin will jump 20% to $148,500 by year-end. It also forecasts that exchange-traded funds will double in number to 80, and stablecoins are on track to reach $500 billion in circulation. The report says digital assets are moving into a “maturity phase” where price discovery comes from strategic allocation decisions and not speculation or hype like in previous years. The prediction comes as the overall market capitalisation of cryptocurrencies hovers around $4.3 trillion, according to CoinGecko. Meanwhile, the circulating value of stablecoins has smashed $300 billion, DefiLlama data shows. Several factors have contributed to the surge. Chief among them? Macroeconomic uncertainties over global trade caused by US President Donald Trump’s policies, his questioning of the Federal Reserve’s independence, fiscal policies, and the government shutdown. These factors have amounted to what analysts refer to as “the debasement trade,” which has seen investors scramble to hoover up safe haven assets like gold and Bitcoin. Trump has also fuelled the rally by backing blockchain-based businesses. Since his second term began, he has backed several pro-industry policies, signed a stablecoin bill into law, and appointed crypto supporters to key positions in government. CF Benchmarks, which is owned by crypto exchange Kraken and powers indexes used by major ETF issuers including BlackRock and Fidelity, is not alone in its bullishness. Laurent Benayoun, CEO of crypto market making firm Acheron Trading, told DL News that “ETFs net inflows exert institutional buying pressure, and associated direct positive price action, on their underlying spot assets.” “Continued support from the US administration and interest rate cuts will lead to further adoption and growth,” Benayoun said. After years of uncertainty, the US policy landscape has flipped. The Genius Act, signed in July, established a federal framework for dollar-backed stablecoins, sparking $30 billion in inflows and sending total stablecoin assets toward $350 billion by year-end. CF Benchmarks expects that figure to reach $500 billion in 2026, as Visa, Mastercard, and PayPal integrate regulated stablecoins into global payment networks. Meanwhile, Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs continue to attract capital. The CME derivatives exchange is also adding new Solana and XRP futures options, expanding institutional exposure to emerging tokens. The report likens this regulatory moment to the “Swensen era” of ETFs in the 2000s, when new listing rules triggered an exponential rise in adoption. The Fed’s first rate cuts in nine months, combined with signals of further easing into 2026, create a supportive backdrop for risk assets. CF Benchmarks expects two additional cuts this year, bringing policy rates near 3.25%. Despite lingering inflation risks, the firm argues that Bitcoin remains at the lower bound of its fair-value range, currently between $85,000 and $212,000, offering a tactical entry point for investors positioning for debasement hedges. The report also points to tokenised equities and real-world assets as the next frontier. With over $40 billion in tokenised assets already issued, CF Benchmarks expects that figure to double in 12 months, with Solana-based xStocks leading early adoption. “Digital assets are no longer a side bet,” the report said.

Title: 10% of Ethereum now locked in ETFs and treasuries – does ETH supply squeeze follow?

Institutional Ethereum appetite remains strong amid volatility, with ETFs managing over $30 billion worth of the digital asset. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Institutional demand for Ethereum has climbed to new highs during this market cycle. According to Strategic ETH Reserve data, spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and Digital Asset Treasury Companies (DATCOs) now control more than 12.5 million ETH, or roughly 10% of the token’s circulating supply. This marks a dramatic expansion from April, when these institutions collectively held about 4 million ETH, representing less than 3% of the total supply. The rise reflects how institutional capital has increasingly turned to Ethereum exposure through regulated ETFs and on-chain treasury allocation amid the growth of the network fundamentals in tokenized assets and stablecoins. According to Token Terminal data, decentralized applications on Ethereum are hosting more than $365 billion in user assets, while the network’s native token trades at a 1.45x multiple of its ecosystem TVL. Data from Strategic ETH Reserve shows that spot Ethereum ETFs currently hold 6.92 million ETH, valued at about $30.76 billion based on an ETH price of $4,448 at press time. The assets are distributed across nine products from eight issuers. BlackRock leads by a wide margin, managing over 4 million ETH worth $17.6 billion, more than half of all ETF-held Ethereum. Grayscale follows with approximately 1.8 million ETH split between its ETHE and ETH trusts. Fidelity ranks third with around 778,200 ETH, while Bitwise holds roughly 151,600 ETH. Other issuers, including VanEck, Franklin Templeton, Invesco Galaxy, and 21Shares, each hold under 100,000 ETH. The strong accumulation trend aligns with surging investor interest in regulated Ethereum exposure. According to SosoValue data, cumulative net inflows into Ethereum ETFs have surpassed $15 billion since launch, signaling that institutional appetite remains robust despite market volatility. Meanwhile, Ethereum-focused Digital Asset Treasury Companies (DATCOs) collectively hold 5.66 million ETH, equivalent to 4.68% of the circulating supply and valued at $25.19 billion. This figure highlights Ethereum’s growing prominence as a corporate treasury asset, second only to Bitcoin in institutional accumulation. July and August marked the peak of these treasury expansion moves, as several firms joined the acquisition wave. Although momentum has since cooled, leading holders continue to expand their stakes. BitMine Immersion Tech tops the list with 2.83 million ETH, worth about $12.59 billion, representing 2.34% of the digital asset supply. The firm aims to eventually control 5% of total ETH, which it views as strategic preparation for broader network adoption. However, the ETH treasury play has drawn criticism from industry experts who argue that South Korean retail money is now propping up some of these companies. Bitcoin advocate Samson Mow claimed that these retail traders have about $6 billion in chasing the next “Strategy play.” Nonetheless, asset management firm VanEck has argued that the strong wave of institutional adoption shows that ETH is a stronger contender to Bitcoin in the race for dominance as a store of value. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential. He imparts insights on a range of topics like DeFi, hacks, mining and culture, underlining transformative power.

The following is a lightly edited transcript of the Oct. 7 edition of Right Now With Perry Bacon. You can watch this video here. Perry Bacon: Welcome to The New Republic show Right Now. I’m the host, Perry Bacon. I’m joined by Arkadi Gerney today. Great great to see you, Arkadi. Arkadi Gerney: Great to see you, Perry. Thanks for having me on. Perry Bacon: I’m going to introduce him a bit, he’s—I’m going to use the term Democratic strategist, and he actually does real strategy. He’s worked for a lot of organizations: He worked for [The Center for American Progress] (CAP), he worked for Michael Bloomberg’s gun organization for some period. But in the last few years he’s worked on thinking about how to take on Trump and how to use the powers of, let’s call it, blue America, from cities to states to liberal institutions. He’s done a lot of thinking and writing, and even before Trump became president the second time, he wrote a very detailed report about how we should prepare for Trump. The report actually argued that Trump 2.0 would be different, and therefore, the protest model and the [approach of] getting the Mitt Romneys and John McCains to vote against Trump would no longer exist, because the moderate Republicans on the Hill are essentially gone. And the protests probably worked the first time better because people were stunned by Trump, but now that he won a second time, we’re in a different period. So, welcome—thanks for joining us. Gerney: Thanks for having me on, Perry. Bacon: So let me ask in a broad sense first: the resistance to Trump. How would you define how that’s going? Gerney: Well, I think, as you were describing the setup, the second version of Trump is harder than the first version. And I think there are three principal reasons why it’s harder: They’re different, we’re different, and the environment and some key institutions are different. Let’s start with them. They’re much more organized. They had a plan—they had Project 2025. They’ve defeated the internal opposition in the Republican Party, so the kinds of people like John McCain who were around in 2017 are not anymore. We’re different—with “we” being small-d democrats and big-D Democrats. I think there’s a lot of exhaustion. Some of that comes out of COVID, some of it comes out of having done this once before. And there’s a lot of division among Democrats about where to go, and I think that’s an understandable, and in some ways healthy debate, which is: What’s the right story for our party going forward? What’s the right coalition? There’s a lot of anxiety, understandably, about how the Democratic Party coalition seems to be falling apart. And then the third thing that makes this very challenging is that the environment is different. Some of the key institutions that were pillars and guardrails in 2017–2020 are not there in the same way. One of those is the courts—in large part because of Trump’s first presidency. There’s been a much more profound takeover of the federal courts, especially at the Supreme Court level. The other one is journalism—your industry, Perry—where the years and years of stress on local journalism, national journalism, you see the consolidation happening, you see people who have more of an “Opinion” background like Bari Weiss taking over CBS News. It’s very different from what we were in. So we shouldn’t be surprised that resisting Trump and finding a path forward is much harder this time around than before. But obviously that makes the project all the more important. Bacon: So you were talking about what states could do even before Trump took office. What did you imagine—let’s go back to the initial writing you were doing. What did you hope [for] states specifically? Why states, why governors—obviously I mean blue state governors. So talk about what you saw the in the potential for states. Why were they an important mechanism for resistance? Gerney: Well, I think states are obviously fundamental in our structure and the structure of democracy, and I think we don’t think about it every day, but the United States is a creation of a bunch of states. It’s sort of the outcome of a contract between states, and we think of divided power as between Congress and the Supreme Court and the presidency, but another critical part of the constitutional structure is the divide between federal power and state power. And if you look at American history, for better or worse—and for probably most of American history, it’s been for the worse—states have been an enormous source of power and resistance to the federal government. You saw after the Civil War, there was a hundred years where a group of states were able to resist civil rights, and it signals the sort of structural centrality that states have. And if you think about—California’s economy is the fourth-largest economy in the world, and in an enormous number of policy areas—schools, sanitation, things that are our daily life things—most of that is done at the state level. And so there’s an enormous source of power. I think the other reason I think about states is if you look at the Biden years and try to think, “What was the MAGA opposition that put Trump back in power?” We can think that the center of gravity was at Mar-a-Lago and on Trump’s Twitter or Truth Social account, but I think the true centers of gravity were in state capitals, where Republican governors and attorneys general and treasurers were using their power in a coordinated way—in an unprecedented way—to undermine the Biden administration and to sort of push their policy prerogatives forward, interfere with blue states. You saw migrant bussing where Texas moved 125,000 migrants, undocumented migrants, into New York and Illinois and other states, that precipitated a sort of logistical crisis, a political crisis. So I think you have a little bit of a model of what states can do to push forward their own prerogatives, to work together, and to undermine a federal government that they disagree with. Bacon: So that model, while I don’t agree with its policy vision, was a model that was coordinated. You’re talking about Greg Abbot, you’re talking about attorney generals and various other states. So you had written before Trump took over, “Here’s a model we should use.” So how is that going? Are the are the Democratic governors in democratic states doing something—let’s tell the good story first. What are the parts of that model or [according to] that model they have used? Gerney: Well, I think a lot of it is happening. First of all, let’s not pretend this is an easy pathway or some sort of silver bullet. This is a very hard, challenging position that these governors and attorneys general are in. But if you look at, for example, the attorneys general, they’ve filed hundreds of cases to block Trump administration initiatives, to block the Trump administration from stealing money from states that they’re obligated by statute to provide. Many of those lawsuits have been successful, at least at the preliminary stages. I think you see among governors, many of them finding their own way to push back and push against the Trump administration. Obviously, a big one is, you know, Trump basically ordered Republican governors, particularly Greg Abbott in Texas, to redistrict their states to try to get an advantage in the 2026 congressional elections, which Texas has proceeded to do. Other Republican states are looking at doing it. The Texas legislators—the Democrats—left the state to try to temporarily block it. But the real response that’s available to blue states is to counter, and that’s what California has done. Gavin Newsom has led an effort to get an initiative on the ballot to allow California to override its independent redistricting for several cycles of elections to counter Texas. And that’s not because Democrats are against independent redistricting, but I think they have to understand that if you have one side that is trying to steal an election because they can’t win—talking about the OBB mega bill that takes away healthcare for millions of people, and cuts taxes for billionaires—that you need a way to respond when they are stacking the deck in their favor. And so I think you see more of that happening, and I think the redistricting thing was something of a mind shift, where you saw some of the governors becoming more active. Obviously, an area of big challenge, I’m in Chicago today, is the issue of ICE and federal agents and National Guard troops who are in cities like Los Angeles, Chicago, Washington, D.C. (which of course is not a state, which ties their hands a little bit in how they can push back). And clearly, this is over the will of the people in those states, over the will of the governors of those states, and trying to provoke a crisis. And so I think that the governors are working on how to respond to this challenge. It’s not easy, but I think there are a lot of tools and levers that they’re beginning to use, and more that they can use, to take the initiative narratively, but also using legal power, economic power, political power. Bacon: One thing I didn’t anticipate, maybe you did, was how aggressively Trump has gone after blue states, blue cities, particularly. I don’t think I expected—maybe the ICE raids I expected, but the combination of the ICE and the National Guard. In some ways, the Trump administration is really taking on cities in a way they didn’t the first time around. Is that fair to say? Gerney: I think that’s fair to say. I think that it’s not just that—One way to interpret it would be that blue states have a bunch of policies that Trump and his allies don’t seem to like, things like Medicaid expansion that gives more healthcare to low- and middle-income working people, and that the reason that blue states are getting targeted more is because they’re going after policies they don’t like. But even if that’s part of it, if you look at what they’re actually doing, they’re clearly picking fights and trying to really target blue states, even on things that would seem to be more neutral. So, for example, the Department of Transportation is rewriting its grant funding formulas to take into account a bunch of factors that will lead to blue states getting less funding and red states getting more funding. And it’s really interesting, because in the Biden administration you saw Democrats kind of do the opposite of this, which is, in the construction of the IRA—the big Biden bill that put a lot of investment in clean energy infrastructure—the structure of the bill actually sent more money to red states and red districts. And part of the political strategy behind that was like, “Hey, let’s get representatives from people who don’t agree with us as much on this to see the benefit of this policy.” What you see with Trump is the opposite, which is reward your friends, punish your enemies, and beat them into submission. But I think there’s a strategy to counter that. Bacon: Talk about the—I’m leery of of these terms, but there’s a piece in Mother Jones that I haven’t got to read yet, but it talks about the idea of California is doing a soft secession. Some of my other guests have used the term “civil war,” not that we have an issue like slavery, but more that the Civil War had a big element of states being in conflict with the federal government. Is there a real level of conflict between the blue states and the federal government right now, and resistance from the states to the federal government? I don’t love the term “civil war,” but we’re in something like that kind of conflict, right? Gerney: I think we want to be careful with these kinds of terms. Probably the metaphor that I’ve thought about the most is sort of a cold civil war, and really, a cold war, which is something like the confrontation between the Soviet Union and the United States. There are flashpoints, there are moments of actual, I guess, violent conflict or violent outbursts, but it’s really about two opposing ideologies and sort of a battle for relative power. And I think when you view it in that lens, one of the best pathways—I think that [for] most big-D Democrats and small-d democrats who want to save American democracy, the objective is to get through this era and to get to some sort of new normal, some sort of more stable agreement between the various factions and states in our country, and something that is durable and, frankly, more united. But how do we get from where we are to that? In my mind, a critical set of approaches are deterrence and hardball. I think you see this in the redistricting context: If you don’t like partisan redistricting, if you let one side unilaterally do it, they’re going to keep doing it. The way to get to some sort of compromise is to credibly convince Republicans, hey, you can do a mid-cycle redistricting—which, by the way, costs money, it’s sort of a mess, it’s not good for voters because one election you have one representative, another election you have another representative, it messes up accountability. It’s not a good way to run a country. But if they think they can get a political advantage or partisan advantage, they’re going to do it. But if you can credibly show that you’re not going to let that happen, you’re creating the conditions where some sort of détente or compromise is more possible. And I think we need to think in that mindset in a lot of different areas. Because, number one, I think it’ll be critical to get through the next three years—but this is not a three-year problem. Even if a Democrat is elected in 2029, even if Democrats win the House and Senate, I don’t think this is going to reset to normal on its own, in part because MAGA has taken over the federal courts. There [are] decades of federalism jurisprudence which essentially pushes power down to the states. And I think we should be interested in state and local power, because that’s where we’re going to solve a lot of the problems that our country faces, too. For example, inside the Democratic coalition, a big debate in the last year has been the so-called “abundance” theory of where Democrats should go—Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson wrote a book by that title, but others have been talking about it. It’s sort of a critique of blue states and how they’ve governed, and tied their hands on building up clean energy and housing and things like that. I think that is, whether you like it or not, something to think about: We need to be more focused on how we can leverage our power, make progress, attract people to blue states. Because I think there are essentially two competing worldviews in this country, and if people who want to save democracy want to do that, we have to both counter the interference in our own states where it’s happening, but we also have to grow and build places that people want to be part of. A big challenge for blue states in the last five years, for example, is that there’s been a net population loss from blue states to red states of five million people. That’s driven especially by affordability—and that’s something that’s got to change. There is no political future for blue states or Democrats in this country if it becomes a collection of very nice, upper-middle-class, suburban, super-liberal places where only a handful of people can afford to live. That’s not going to work. So I think there’s a lot of work to do—both to counter red states and the hostile federal government, but also to reimagine how we govern in blue states and cities to make them really great places to live across the board. Bacon: Let me drill in a couple of things you said. Cold civil war. Did that start in 2015, or 2025, or—what’s the time period? Because it’s not just about Trump. In some ways, these competing ideologies existed a little bit longer. Define that term a little bit, or define what we’re talking about. Gerney: If you look at a few different indicators in data and research, it’s probably been going on—or growing—for about 30 years. I think it kind of started in the 1990s. For example, one measure of differences between blue states and red states are the laws they end up adopting on different issues. A few researchers have looked at what I would term “policy divergence”—which the trend of blue states and red states adopting more divergent, different, policies across different issues: guns, abortion, taxes, you name it. And if you look from the New Deal to basically the year 2000, across all these issues, there isn’t growing differences between blue states and red states in the policies they were adopting. If anything, there is some convergence—the policies are becoming less differentiated across these blocs of states. But in the last 25 years, that difference just keeps growing and growing and growing. So the difference between living in a blue state and a red state has become much more consequential. For example, if you go to some other country and somebody asks you, “Hey, Perry, tell me—what are the laws on guns in America?” It totally depends where you are. It’s pretty different in Massachusetts and Kentucky. “What are the laws on abortion in America?” We used to have a somewhat consistent set of rules on abortion. Now we have wildly varied rules. And I think that’s made this contest more consequential, which is part of what these blocs of states and parties are looking for when they take power in the federal government, is, “Hey, can we take our way and impose it on the rest of the country?” Ideologically, conservatives used to talk 30 years ago about small government and devolving power to the states. But you see in Trump—probably the most maximalist president in terms of executive power—it’s not just about putting power in the executive branch. It’s about trying to intimidate the Federal Reserve, get rid of the independent agencies, and put all the power in the president himself. That’s a real danger in terms of the risk of autocracy. And I think there’s a playbook about how to respond to that, and I think state power—and a state response—is at the center of that playbook. Bacon: You mentioned some highlights of the coordinated lawsuits. OK, those are the highlights of the “Blue America” response. What are some things you wish there was more [of]? Some lowlights, or things that have not happened the way you wish they were in terms of the blue state response? Gerney: Well, I think that there’s one thing from the red-state response in the Biden years, is you saw a lot of activity trying to push corporate decision-making. Red states didn’t like ESG—that’s environmental, social, and governance investing strategies. They didn’t like DEI. And they started using their pension fund investments and state procurement power to push companies out of those kinds of practices. For example, Texas took $8 billion from the teachers’ pension fund and pulled it out of BlackRock, a big Wall Street financial firm that was the biggest promoter of this environmental investment strategy. BlackRock pulled out of ESG investing. They eventually have gotten off Texas’s blacklist. And they’ve really used that power—as investors, as procurers—to change corporate America. That’s a battle blue states should be more effective in fighting, in part because blue states have larger economies, higher GDP, higher GDP per capita. They have larger state governments, and they have larger state workforces with more generous pension benefits. If you look at pensions, blue states have 75 percent more money invested than red states. So it’s like a middleweight fighter taking on a heavyweight fighter—but the heavyweight fighter hasn’t responded. Republicans talk a lot about “woke capitalism” and how the government is interfering in the marketplace, but in the last few years, they’re the ones who’ve been doing it. You see this now at the federal level, where Trump is going company by company, and investing money in Intel. And if we wonder why there’s been this widespread corporate capitulation to Trump, I don’t think it started right after the election—it started a few years ago when the states started using their power. And again, this may not be something we want to do. What we probably should be doing with pension fund investments is trying to get the best return possible so that firefighters and teachers can retire securely and safely. But if red states are going to use that power to try to push around companies, and control their practices, and turn them into people who will fund their campaigns, I think blue states need to use powers like that—places where they actually have more power—to respond accordingly. Bacon: You used the words hardball and deterrence a few minutes ago. So I think part of this is—and even when we’ve talked a few times—every time you talk, I’m sort of like, “Do I really want California to be using their pension to, like, force…” But the answer to these questions has got to be yes—part of what you’re saying is, things that make me queasy in sort of a liberal way, are gonna [happen]. We’re in a fight over power, and that requires hardball. Is that the subtext here, or the actual text? Gerney: I think that’s right. For example, in the last 24 hours, Governor Pritzker and Governor Newsom sent letters to the National Governors Association, which is the bipartisan coalition of all 50 governors—and they said, “Hey, if you’re not going to say something about National Guard troops coming into our states without our request, we’re going to drop out of this organization.” And I think that’s a healthy response to something that’s not working anymore. I think we have to be able to look squarely at what we have. At the end of the day, yes, we want to have a national bipartisan governors association where they talk about ideas across party lines. But if the red-state governors are not going to say something about something that is an across-the-board violation of the Constitution and of the role of states, what’s the point of being in something like this? And look, I’ve talked about some of the challenges that blue states have around affordability and this sort of net migration toward red states. But blue states have a lot to be proud of too. If you look at educational outcomes, if you look at life expectancy—there’s a big difference. If you look at crime in cities—Republicans talk a lot about crime in Chicago and cities like that, but if you look at crime across states and control for urbanization, there’s more crime in red states. There are a lot of reasons for that, but I think there’s a lot that’s going reasonably well in blue states, and part of what you want to do is tell that story. There are some places where you can leverage those differences: there’s insurance regulation at the state level. Should people be subsidizing Florida property insurance when there’s all this home-insurance risk in Florida because the policies are not doing anything about climate change? I think there are a lot of tools that are potentially available to create economic pressure to get the kinds of policy incentives that more of us would like to see. Bacon: I think we’ve talked about Pritzker and Newsom a few times. We’ve talked about Democratic AGs. Are the other Democratic governors involved in resisting? I don’t know, but part of it is Newsom and Pritzker are presumably running for president, so I think that’s part of what’s going on. That’s why the media covers them. But are the other Democratic governors involved in resisting? Gerney: I think different governors are taking different approaches—and of course they represent very different states. I think, Perry, you’re from Kentucky, so you’ve got a Democratic governor, Beshear, who’s in a very red state. And, you know, I think the right answer for governors is that you can’t—you can’t do it [where] everyone does the same thing. I do think you see a number of governors who are creatively pushing back in different ways. For example, President Trump was talking about sending the National Guard to Baltimore, saying Baltimore’s out of control with crime, when in fact crime has been going down there for many years. Wes Moore, the governor there, said, “Hey, why don’t you come to Baltimore and walk around with me, and come see for yourself.” I thought it was a creative, kind of playful response that shut the president up. Another governor who I think has handled this era pretty well is Kathy Hochul, the New York state governor. After the November election, she had the second-lowest favorability rating of any governor in the country. Now she has a positive favorability rating. I think part of that is that she’s counter-punched, in different ways, at different times, with the Trump administration. She’s done that even though there are things the state has to negotiate with the Trump administration around. For example, there’s a congestion pricing plan for New York City that has to do with how cars are tolled to reduce congestion and raise revenue. The Trump administration tries to block it. But I think she’s both been punching at times, negotiating at other times, and I think that’s the best strategy with Trump—which is, if you put your hands up right away, he’s just going to bowl you over and keep taking. Bacon: Let’s move to other institutions and then before we close here. I want to talk about cities ... Let’s talk about cities first. Are there any are there good—are there useful things cities are doing, useful resistant cities, and are there things that cities could be doing better. Gerney: Obviously, cities vary enormously in their size, their budgets, etc. A huge— Bacon: Let’s take the 50 largest cities—Boston, Chicago—let’s take the 50 largest cities, for now. Gerney: I think that cities—they’re on the front lines of these questions, whether it’s crime or education—and so they have real choices to make about how much are they going to facilitate things like the ICE raids, or not participate, or try to protect people. So I think there is a lot for cities to do. I think their hands, constitutionally, are a bit more tied up than states’. Cities don’t exist in the Constitution, states do. And cities are basically creations of states. So in some states, cities are very powerful. So New York City, for example, has a massive budget—New York City’s budget is the size of the state of Florida’s. And right now, there’s this mayoral campaign, and Zohran Mamdani seems like he’s the favorite to win the general election. I think that will be a real bellwether for other mayors, and I also think it’ll be a real point of contestation with Trump. Trump’s from New York, it’s the biggest city, and he’s definitely wanted to use Mamdani as something of a foil. I think you may see a lot of confrontation shifting to New York in the new year, with a new mayor. Bacon: We mentioned corporations a little bit earlier, but I mean, it’s corporations. I wish they were doing more, but is that probably the most logical place where, of course, they’re falling in line? Maybe there’s nothing to expect beyond that, or ... ? Gerney: I think there’s been a massive capitulation by businesses, and they’re going to look at their bottom lines and take the path of least resistance. That’s what businesses are mostly going to do. But I also think there’s been some mistakes and overreactions. For example, in the capitulating law firms, there were a lot of big law firms that were under pressure from Trump to settle with the Trump administration and offer free legal services to president Trump’s preferred causes. The firms that settled—a lot of them have lost lawyers who’ve left, they’ve lost some clients. And then the firms that fought back, based on what accounts there are, seem to be doing quite well. And part of that is, if you’re in a dispute with someone, do you want to hire the lawyer who might be cowed and give up because there’s a little pressure, or do you want the lawyer who’s never going to back down? I think it’s a real problem for them—big businesses, global businesses. They have to recognize, yes, who’s the president of the United States matters, and what the policies of the United States are matter. But they also have to sell across these 50 states—and who the governors are, what the policies are in those states matter, what the policies are around the world matter. And they have to think about what’s rational for their businesses. So as it relates, for example, to climate change: Donald Trump may decide that climate change is a hoax, that he hates windmills, and that he wants to push businesses out of that. And he’s had some success in bullying businesses so far. But they have to think, what is the real challenge here? What are the other markets and actors that are ultimately going to set the rules around this? What is strategy that ultimately makes sense? There’s a lot of power in influencing those decisions, especially among blue states. If you can coordinate your regulatory incentives, you may see businesses begin to behave differently. And I think you may see them begin to behave differently as we get closer to the end of the Trump administration. Despite his threats to run for a third term—which he’s not constitutionally allowed to do—someday this is going to end. It doesn’t mean the challenges are going to end, but every actor is going to be assessing, “What makes sense for me this month?” But also they’ll be remembering that what they do this month may have consequences 12 months, 24 months from now. Bacon: Let me close—I want to hit four other institutions, and I’ll give you my four other parts of our [side], and I’ll let you—I’ll give my views on them and then see what you think. So my sense is: Congressional Democrats started off pretty poorly in terms of this, but they’ve gotten more aggressive now. I think you’ve been urging me, when you and I have talked, that states might be a better venue for this in any way because they have more actual power. But I think congressional Democrats are getting better, but are not great. I think the public has been there from the beginning. If you look at the No Kings protests and things [like that], the public—and Trump’s approval rating has gone down a lot—the public seems to be resisting and opposing pretty strongly, I’d say. Higher education I’ve been very disappointed by, and surprisingly so — another place where I think capitulation has been too fast and really bad. And then the news media is another place I’d say has been generally disappointing—though you’ve got great work at ProPublica, The New Republic, some of the more left-wing publications have done pretty well, I’d say—but the sort of mainstream. So—news media, higher ed, congressional Democrats, the public. Any of those you want to take, disagree with me about, or want to amplify? Gerney: I’ll try to do a little bit of each. Congressional Democrats—I appreciate what they’re doing right now with the standoff on the shutdown. I think they’ve settled on a clear ask around health care that makes a lot of sense. I also think their actual leverage and power are quite limited, so they have a hard hand to play. Part of the reason we’ve been more focused on states and governors and attorneys general, is that they just have a lot more they can do to successfully obstruct and offer a different path forward. On media, it’s a huge challenge, as you know, and it started long before the Trump administration. Because of changes in social media platforms and how advertising works, there’s been incredible stress in this industry that’s driving some consolidation. But what’s really of concern, is that the Trump administration using its leverage as a regulator to influence—to make news organizations to capitulate. There was the bogus Disney–George Stephanopoulos settlement. Then there was the 60 Minutes bogus settlement and lawsuit. And I think what you’re seeing—Republicans have complained for a long time about mainstream media. I think what’s going to be left of mainstream media in a couple of years is very consolidated and largely aligned with Trump. So I think it’ll be really important in this environment for there to be more alternative media—and for people to become part of the media more. I think it’ll be a lot of Substack video chats, and newsletters, and different places that will be essential. It doesn’t mean that all the pillars of media are falling apart. A lot of people complain about The New York Times, but I think they’ve probably handled this last ten months reasonably well. But it’s a real challenge. Bacon: And on that note, I think it’s been a great conversation. You’ve given us some positive things to think about, which I think is important, in that the states are resisting. I think it’s an important story that you’re explaining. Anything else you want to finish on, anything else you wanna add? Gerney: My advice for regular people who are trying to figure out how to get involved and make a difference: People have often said, “Think globally, act locally.” I’d really look around you, and your city councils, your state legislators, your state comptrollers, offices you may not be paying much attention to, and start thinking about what you want from them. How could it make where you are work better and be a better place to live? But also, how can they do something—use your power, to help them use their power, to push back? Bacon: That’s great. Arkadi, where can people find your work? I don’t think you do a ton of social media, but are there things you’ve written that you want to highlight? Gerney: I had an op-ed in The Washington Post, something in Democracy Journal, the American Prospect—if you Google my name, you’ll find it—but hopefully more coming soon. Bacon: Good. Arkadi, thanks for joining us. Good to see you. Gerney: Thanks, Perry. Bye. Right Now With Perry Bacon is a twice-weekly show about national politics with a focus on the radicalism of the Trump administration and tactics to combat it. The program, hosted by New Republic staff writer Perry Bacon on Substack, features in-depth discussions with experts and politicians. It goes beyond the daily headlines to explain why things are happening and put them in a broader context.

The massive purchase demonstrates continued institutional accumulation of the digital asset through the firm’s spot ETF vehicle. BlackRock has maintained strategic purchases of Ethereum via its spot ETF, reflecting growing institutional confidence in the asset as a core component of diversified portfolios. The acquisition tightens Ethereum supply. The purchase aligns with BlackRock’s expansion into regulated crypto products, enhancing accessibility for traditional investors through ETF structures. Ethereum serves as a preferred settlement layer for institutional investments due to its liquidity and security features. Share this article Sign in to your account Don’t have an account?

Title: BlackRock Bitcoin Fund Hits ‘Absurd’ Growth, Eyes $100B AUM
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/blackrock-bitcoin-fund-hits-absurd-growth-eyes-100b-aum/
Time Published: 2025-10-08T07:00:09Z

According to market reports, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has climbed to the edge of a major milestone, with assets under management roughly between $98 billion and $100 billion. In just over a year since launch, the fund has generated roughly $244–$245 million in annualized revenue, driven by steady inflows and a 0.25% management fee. This rapid rise has made IBIT one of the most lucrative products in BlackRock’s lineup. IBIT reached its current size in about 435 days. Based on reports, that pace is far faster than many legacy funds took to build similar scale — Vanguard’s S&P 500 ETF (VOO) took roughly 2,011 days to hit $100 billion. Market watchers have said IBIT may become the fastest ETF ever to reach $100 billion. Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas describes this ascent as “absurd.” The math is simple: large flows plus rising bitcoin prices push AUM higher, which then boosts fee income. That loop has been powerful this year. $IBIT a hair away from $100 billion, is now the most profitable ETF for BlackRock by a good amount now based on current aum. Check out the ages of the rest of the Top 10. Absurd. pic.twitter.com/E8ZMI2wynx — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) October 6, 2025 On a recent trading day, US spot Bitcoin ETFs saw net inflows near $1.2 billion. IBIT reportedly captured about $970 million of that total. Based on market coverage, more than half of ETF inflows into the US market went into IBIT, underscoring its lure for many investors. When money pours in at this scale, the demand for the underlying bitcoin is pushed higher, and price moves can be amplified. Some traders watch these inflow days closely because similar spikes have come near local price tops in the past. Reports have disclosed a few clear risks for investors and for the broader market. One is the premium or discount that can form between an ETF’s market price and its Net Asset Value; that gap can widen during stressed moments. Another is regulation: rules in the US or abroad could change, and that could affect flows. Competition is also a factor — fee pressure from rival issuers could alter revenue projections. Finally, rapid growth is easier at the start; sustaining this pace will be harder as the base becomes larger. IBIT’s structure relies on daily creation and redemption by authorized participants, and it uses a major custody setup for the bitcoin holdings. According to filings and industry reports, BlackRock is exploring product extensions such as a bitcoin “premium income” ETF that would aim to generate yield through options strategies, and it has taken steps like filing to create supporting trust entities. Those moves suggest the firm is planning for multiple ways to serve demand. Featured image from Newscom, chart from TradingView For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: BlackRock Leads $4.5B ETF Surge as Bitcoin Hits Record High: Altcoin Funds Next?
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/blackrock-leads-4b-surge-bitcoin-hits-record-high/
Time Published: 2025-10-08T05:00:07Z
Full Content:
Institutional demand roared back to start October, with crypto ETFs posting a record $4.5 billion in combined weekly inflows. Bitcoin funds drew $3.24 billion across five straight “green” sessions, helping BTC notch a new all-time high near $126,200. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) led the charge, capturing $1.82 billion for the week and $970 million in a single day, while Fidelity’s FBTC, ARK 21Shares’ ARKB, Bitwise’s BITB, and VanEck’s HODL added hundreds of millions more. Trading activity was equally torrid as Bitcoin ETF volume topped $26 billion for the week and net assets jumped to $164.5 billion, underscoring that flows, not leverage, are driving this leg higher. Ether ETFs added $1.30 billion over the same stretch, also logging five straight days of inflows. BlackRock’s ETHA dominated with $691.7 million, followed by Fidelity’s FETH ($305.3 million), while Bitwise and Grayscale mini trusts contributed steady additions. ETH ETF volumes reached $9.9 billion and net assets climbed to $30.57 billion, signaling that institutional allocators are broadening beyond BTC, often pairing a Bitcoin core position with an Ethereum “growth” sleeve tied to staking yield, Layer-2 expansion, and smart-contract dominance. Technically, ETH is holding above key supports as it eyes $4,750–$4,800; a decisive break could magnet $5,000, adding fresh fuel to ETF demand and year-end portfolio rebalancing. With Bitcoin and Ether cementing their ETF beachhead, attention is shifting to potential altcoin products. Markets are tracking deadline windows and updated S-1s for large-cap names, commonly cited: Solana (SOL), XRP, Dogecoin (DOGE), and Litecoin (LTC), as issuers push to expand the investable crypto toolkit. Any green lights here would unlock fresh mandate-driven flows, deepen liquidity, and extend the rotation now visible across large caps. What to watch in Q4: BlackRock’s leadership in spot Bitcoin ETF inflows capped a blockbuster week that pushed BTC to records and lifted total crypto AUM. With Ether ETFs surging and altcoin funds on the horizon, the Q4 playbook increasingly favors accumulation on dips as long-only capital turns crypto into a core allocation, not a trade.

Rob Crothers TIAA announced Monday the hiring of Rob Crothers as head of business development and product implementation, starting in November. Crothers, who had been BlackRock Inc.’s head of U.S. retirement, will lead efforts to develop TIAA’s strategic partnerships and business opportunities in the 401(k) corporate market. He will report to Colbert Narcisse, TIAA’s chief product and business development officer, and will be based in New York. BlackRock will not replace Crothers directly, according to a company spokesperson; Jaime Magyera will serve as head of wealth and retirement, and Crothers’ responsibilities will be absorbed by others at the firm. In July, TIAA and Transamerica Corp. announced a strategic partnership to offer the Nuveen Lifecycle Income Collective Investment Trust Series as a default option for retirement plans recordkept by Transamerica. The solution integrates Nuveen’s target-date-fund features with guaranteed lifetime income through TIAA’s Secure Income Account. Want the latest institutional investment industry news and insights? Sign up for CIO newsletters.  “Rob joins us at a time when TIAA’s strategy and strategic investments are coming together,” Narcisse said in a statement. “Within the next decade, it will seem as strange for a retirement plan to lack guaranteed income options as it would today for a plan to operate without target-date funds. We are not just participating in this transformation—we’‘re driving it.” Crothers took over BlackRock’s U.S. retirement unit when then-Head of Retirement Anne Ackerley moved to a senior adviser role in July 2024. During his 18 years at BlackRock, Crothers led development of BlackRock’s target-date CIT product with an embedded fixed deferred annuity and served as head of product, head of strategy, global equity lead and lead business manager. TIAA also announced that Roger Marinzoli will lead its product development and innovation team.

Highlights Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), owner of the NYSE, invested $2 billion in prediction market Polymarket, gaining a key role in distributing its event-driven data and collaborating on tokenization projects. The partnership is aimed at reengineering how assets and data are represented and exchanged, aiming to build trusted, transparent, and tokenized markets that could appeal to both institutional and crypto-native participants. Industry leaders like Robinhood and BlackRock also foresee tokenization transforming all asset classes; underscoring how pilot concepts are evolving into infrastructure for real-world financial operations. One would presume that Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), the owner and operator of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), would have its finger on the pulse of American financial markets. Literally.

Δ And on Tuesday (Oct. 7), ICE gave the rest of the world a glimpse of where it sees the infrastructure for finance heading in the future when it announced a strategic $2 billion investment in the prediction market Polymarket. The deal, which values Polymarket at roughly $8 billion pre-investment, grants ICE not only a financial stake but also a central role as the global distributor of Polymarket’s event-driven data. But just as crucially, the two companies will collaborate on a new generation of tokenization initiatives, a phrase that is becoming the shorthand for reengineering how assets, data and even forecasts are represented, exchanged and priced in modern markets. “Realizing the potential of new technologies, such as tokenization, will require collaboration between established market leaders and next-generation innovators. We couldn’t be more excited to build together,” said Shayne Coplan, founder and CEO of Polymarket, in a statement. ICE isn’t alone in its rosy view of tokenization’s potential impact across financial markets. Robinhood’s CEO also this month reportedly predicted a worldwide spread of real-world asset tokenization, calling it a “freight train” that “can’t be stopped” and which will eventually “eat the entire financial system.” Robinhood in June began offering more than 200 tokenized U.S. stocks to customers in the European Union. Advertisement: Scroll to Continue For the ICE-Polymarket deal, the structural safeguards, compliance obligations, and capital buffer expectations faced by ICE make it’s embrace of tokenization one that will be closely watched, and potentially later imitated, by other ecosystem stakeholders. Read also: The Digital Asset Primer: On-Chain Tokenization for Payments Professionals While the headline is about prediction markets, the subtext of the ICE-Polymarket partnership is that tokenization could reshape many other domains of finance and data. For more than half a decade, tokenization has been touted as the next evolutionary step in finance, promising faster settlement, programmable compliance, and fractionalized ownership of everything from real estate to corporate bonds. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink wrote in an earlier shareholder letter this year that: “Every stock, every bond, every fund — every asset — can be tokenized.” “Banks are in the state where they are thinking about blockchains as public infrastructure that they need to rely on,” Chainalysis Co-Founder and CEO Jonathan Levin told PYMNTS in a separate interview. “When we started the business in 2014 … cryptocurrency only meant blockchains that had native cryptocurrency tokens,” he said. “Today, people are putting all types of financial instruments on the blockchain.” Yet outside of pilot projects, most of the world’s financial assets still trade on traditional ledgers. ICE and Polymarket are betting that the missing link has been credible data, not just software. In a tokenized ecosystem, an asset’s digital twin is only as valuable as the verifiable data that updates its state — whether that is a price feed, a corporate event, a change in weather patterns, or the outcome of a policy vote. By fusing Polymarket’s blockchain-native forecasting framework with ICE’s regulatory and infrastructural heft, the two hope to build not just isolated tokenized assets, but entire tokenized data markets. Read more: Crypto Is Coming for the Cubicle; Are Finance Teams Ready? The partnership reflects a deeper ideological reconciliation between two worlds once at odds. ICE is emblematic of the highly regulated, centralized machinery of global finance. Polymarket, by contrast, grew out of the permissionless ethos of decentralized finance (DeFi), where smart contracts and crowd-sourced liquidity drive prediction markets on open blockchains. Institutional players like ICE bring credibility, scale and integration with existing financial infrastructure. Decentralized networks contribute transparency, composability, and an innovation cadence unencumbered by legacy systems. Together, they can address the core challenge that has held tokenization back: trust. By anchoring event data and derivative products in transparent, verifiable markets while ensuring distribution and compliance through an established intermediary, the partnership aims to satisfy both crypto-native participants and institutional end-users. For regulators, that combination may also be easier to supervise than the largely offshore platforms that have characterized the sector to date.

Title: Connecticut governor warns Wall Street at risk if Mamdani wins NYC mayor’s race

Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont warned that his fellow Democrat Zohran Mamdani could cripple Wall Street if he wins the New York City mayor’s race –and said the fallout could spill across state lines. Lamont said he was worried about a Mamdani victory and how it could upend the financial sector — both in New York and in the Constitution State — in an interview with Bloomberg Television on Tuesday. “New York City is the financial capital of the world — and we’re a big piece of it here,” Lamont said. “I want to make sure that the next mayor understands how important New York City is to that system, and that’s important to Connecticut.” Connecticut serves as a hub to the hedge fund industry, and is home to Steve Cohen’s Point72, Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates, and Cliff Asness-founded AQR Capital Management. Many high-flying financiers also commute into the Big Apple from its neighbor to the north to work at big financial firms like JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and BlackRock. Mamdani, a self-described socialist who won a thumping victory over Andrew Cuomo in the Democratic primary this summer, has campaigned on promises of rent freezes, free child care, and open government-run grocery stores. Incumbent Eric Adams dropped out last week. The 33-year-old Uganda-born Muslim has rattled Wall Street, the real estate industry, and other segments of the city’s business community with his plans to hike taxes on corporations and New York’s wealthy to help pay for his left-wing policies. Lamont said he thinks the finance industry appreciates the certainty and stability in Connecticut. “They know where the state is going to go and the taxes are a little bit less,” he told the financial news channel. A poll conducted for Fox News released on Sept 24, before Mayor Adams quit the race, shows Mamdani way out in front with 47%. Ex-New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo is currently polling at 29% and Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa is at 11%. The Post ran an editorial last week warning how states such as Texas are moving in to swoop up financial jobs and that New York is reaching “the point of no return” amid a looming Mamdani victory. The Lone Star State levies no state personal or corporate taxes, while New York state personal levies range from 4% to 10.9%, and its corporate tax rate runs from 6.5% to 7.25% JPMorgan now employs more people in Texas than any other US state, while Goldman Sachs is working on an 800,000-square-foot building that will open in Dallas in 2028.

Title: Bitcoin Reaches Forecasted All-Time High: Prophecy Predicts Bear Market Low In 364 Days

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Bitcoin (BTC), the leading cryptocurrency, has made headlines this week by consistently breaking all-time highs, recently surpassing the $126,000 mark for the first time. However, the current price action has not only drawn attention from investors but also reignited discussions surrounding a notable prediction made two years ago. An anonymous user had forecasted that Bitcoin would achieve a peak on October 6, 2025—a prediction that came to fruition just yesterday. Despite this milestone, Bitcoin has retraced to around $121,000 within hours after today’s record, leading to a wave of liquidations from long positions across various exchanges. This rapid price fluctuation has led many to speculate that the recent peak could potentially mark the cycle’s all-time high, suggesting that Bitcoin might soon enter a new bear market phase. The prediction made in December 2023 posits that if historical patterns hold true, the bear market low is expected to occur precisely 364 days later. This theory has gained traction amidst today’s volatility, with experts warning that a shift in market sentiment could be imminent. Market analyst Doctor Profit has recently cautioned that despite the current bullish trend, the market is entering a precarious phase. He noted that while there is a prevailing sense of euphoria, underlying financial indicators are signaling a potential liquidity crisis. Highlighting the current situation, Doctor Profit pointed to the Reverse Repo (RRP) market, which has plummeted from a peak of $2.2 trillion in mid-2022 to a mere $8–10 billion today. This decline raises concerns about the stability of interbank liquidity, suggesting that the financial system may soon face significant dislocations if the RRP continues to dry up. Historical parallels from 2018, 2019, and 2023 indicate that such liquidity issues often precede major market corrections. Moreover, US banks are reportedly grappling with approximately $395 billion in unrealized losses as of the second quarter of the year, putting additional pressure on their balance sheets. In the crypto space, recent trends reveal substantial inflows into exchange-traded funds (ETFs), with firms like BlackRock contributing over $1 billion in Bitcoin and $200 million in Ethereum just last week. However, Doctor Profit contends that the market’s broader liquidity picture remains concerning. While retail traders are expressing optimism about a “liquidity flood,” the expert cautions that the influx of cash into money market funds could actually drain liquidity from broader markets rather than enhance it. The current market environment is also characterized by a notable uptick in insider selling, according to the expert’s broader landscape analysis, in which executives are reportedly offloading shares at an unprecedented rate, even as retail investor inflows surge. The expert believes that this alleged market manipulation often signals a market cycle peak, creating what he believes “a highly toxic mix” that could have adverse implications for future price movements. In conclusion, Doctor Profit notes that the overall sentiment paints a bearish picture at a macro level. Both the crypto and stock markets are seen as being at an increased risk of entering a bear market after the fourth quarter.

Estadão Conteúdo 07/10/2025 16h36 • Atualizado 2 dias atrás 07/10/2025 16h36 • Atualizado 2 dias atrás Publicidade O bitcoin caía durante a tarde desta terça-feira, 7, revertendo parte dos ganhos registrados ontem, quando ultrapassou a marca de US$ 126.000 pela primeira vez. Investidores continuam acompanhando a paralisação das atividades do governo dos Estados Unidos enquanto avaliam declarações dos dirigentes do Federal Reserve (Fed, o banco central norte-americano). Por volta das 16 horas (em Brasília), o bitcoin tinha baixa de 3,83%, a US$ 121.280,41 e o ethereum caía 4,79%, a US$ 4.480,11, de acordo com a plataforma Coinbase. Outros ativos digitais como a XRP e Solana também registraram perdas. Forte demanda global por ativos digitais impulsiona captação recorde em ETFs, enquanto bitcoin atinge valor máximo e atrai investidores em meio à incerteza econômica Após semanas de valorização, o Bitcoin mantém tendência de alta — veja os próximos alvos. A BlackRock explica que correlações negativas antigas estão se desfazendo, como a de títulos e ações. Assim, investidores estão buscando alternativas para esse tipo de dinâmica, como o ouro e o bitcoin, de acordo com a gestora. Neste cenário, os traders estão adicionando os ativos cada vez mais aos portfólios, “à medida que a eficácia de investimentos de segurança diminuiu”, conclui. A Navallier também faz a relação entre o metal precioso e as criptomoedas, vendo ambos os ativos captando fluxos que normalmente iriam para outros tipos de investimentos e crescendo nas últimas semanas. Já o Deutsche Bank vai além e afirma que o bitcoin pode estar ao lado do ouro nos bancos centrais até 2030, com a moeda se consolidando como ativo de reserva estratégica e cada vez mais legítimo conforme a liquidez e a regulação avançam. No noticiário de cripto, hoje a Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), dona da Bolsa de Valores de Nova York (NYSE), anunciou que vai investir até US$ 2 bilhões na plataforma de apostas Polymarket, que usa cripto e blockchain em seu sistema de previsões. Investidores também acompanham o shutdown do governo dos EUA, que chegou no sétimo dia hoje e segue sem previsão para acabar, com o presidente Donald Trump declarando que o líder da oposição no Senado é “incapaz de fazer um acordo”.

The issuer’s Bitcoin ETF, which is nearing the $100 billion asset mark thanks to massive inflows and a new run-up in the token itself, generates more revenue than any other in the firm’s lineup of 1,000-plus globally, according to data from Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart at Bloomberg Intelligence. Their calculations suggest that the fund, which charges a modest 0.25% fee, brings in an annual revenue haul that tops $240 million, a remarkable feat for an ETF that’s less than two years old, the pair wrote in a note. IBIT, as the fund is known, has become shorthand in the ETF industry for the crypto category given its size—and the pace at which it attained it. Its assets are on track to hit the $100 billion milestone about five times faster than any other ETF in history, with money pouring in from both retail and institutional investors. Moreover, it’s “by far the youngest” of the 20 largest ETFs, with the rest having taken years to achieve their super-large loads, the BI analysts wrote. The race to $100 billion has been aided by Bitcoin’s surge to an all-time high — over the weekend, the digital coin crossed above $125,000 for the first time. The cryptocurrency has soared more than 70% in the wake of Donald Trump’s November electoral win after the president campaigned on greater crypto acceptance. The administration has pushed forward initiatives to help bring digital assets further into the mainstream while feeding investors’ appetite for the class. “The fact that IBIT is now BlackRock’s most profitable product is extremely impressive,” said Seyffart, who noted that the fund—and rival crypto-tied ETFs—faced a lot of criticism ahead of their January 2024 launches. “We were very bullish on the amount of demand and flows that we thought would come into the Bitcoin ETFs, but even these numbers have blown away our most bullish expectations.” In its first year, IBIT took in more than $37 billion in inflows. It was an eye-popping feat many considered all the more remarkable given that critics argued investors had little need for the product as they could access Bitcoin via various exchanges. So far in 2025 another $26 billion has flowed in, a spoil that puts it in the top five largest inflows among all U.S. ETFs, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. All in all, it has about $70 billion more in assets than the second-largest Bitcoin ETF. A BlackRock spokesperson declined to comment for the story. “A lot of the success comes down to how well it sells,” said Kaiko’s Adam Morgan McCarthy of IBIT. “The digital-gold narrative has gained momentum this year, particularly back in April after the tariff announcement in the States. With government debt rising and the dollar weakening, it’s really increased the appeal of Bitcoin to a broader spectrum of investors.” © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Title: Texas Stock Exchange Receives Federal Approval

The Texas Stock Exchange last week crossed its latest hurdle toward becoming a direct competitor to the dominance of the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq. The announcement that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission had approved the Dallas-based startup to operate as a national exchange was met with celebration by Texas lawmakers, including Gov. Greg Abbott, who declared “Texas is swiftly becoming America’s financial hub.” The hype around the Texas Stock Exchange, or TXSE (pronounced Tex-ee), has been building since the June 2024 announcement that the exchange intended to launch with $120 million in backing from investment large firms like BlackRock and Citadel Securities, making it one of the most well-funded attempts at a new national exchange in decades. TXSE officials say the strength of the Texas economy made the move possible, noting the many Fortune 500 companies that have come to the state, drawn by favorable regulatory and taxation policies. Texas is home to the headquarters of the second most Fortune 500 companies in the country, leading New York and closely trailing California. “Texas is a major player in the U.S. regardless of the exchange landscape, but it ultimately makes sense as the 7th largest economy in the world,” Global Managing Director of Listings Nicole Chambers told a gathering of Dallas business leaders in September, adding that 45 countries smaller than Texas have their own stock exchanges. “Texas has really become a leader in where you can do business,” Chambers said at the panel discussion at the University of Texas Austin campus. “That is why there is the Texas stock exchange. We couldn’t do this in Oregon or in Nebraska.” When TXSE begins listing stocks — that’s expected to happen next fall — it won’t even be the only stock exchange hosted in Dallas. Following the announcement of TXSE’s intention to seek SEC approval, the New York Stock Exchange in February announced it would reincorporate its Chicago electronic exchange and move it to Dallas, branding it NYSE Texas. Bill Bailey, managing director of market intelligence at TXSE, said he sees that decision as a reaction to TXSE’s creation, also noting Nasdaq’s March announcement that it would open a regional headquarters in Dallas. The moves promise to test whether Dallas’ recent growth into a hub for financial services firms is significant enough to justify the city’s new nickname: “Y’all Street.” Can a startup stock exchange lure companies to join? Stock exchanges are private institutions where stocks, bonds and other securities are traded, connecting supply and demand “like any other market,” University of Texas at Arlington associate professor of finance Sriram Villupuram said. The bell ringings on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq to signal the start of the day’s trading stand out in the minds of the public, but those events are largely for public relations as the two exchanges compete to convince companies to list themselves on their separate exchanges. Since the acquisition of the American Stock Exchange by the NYSE in 2008, the NYSE and Nasdaq have been the two dominant exchanges in the U.S., effectively creating a duopoly, Villupuram said. Regional exchanges outside of New York, like the Boston Stock Exchange, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange and Chicago Stock Exchange have been swallowed up by the parent companies of the NYSE and Nasdaq, while other exchanges shut down. Attempts to create a third, dominant national exchange have largely floundered, failing to attract a significant number of companies that want to list on their exchange. TXSE leadership says this time will be different. The exchange will be entirely digital but have a physical presence in Dallas, Bailey said. TXSE also intends to hold bell ringing ceremonies for its companies and incorporate much of the pomp and circumstance of its two rival exchanges with its own Texas flair, he added. With the $120 million in backing from investors like BlackRock and Citadel Securities — that amount has since grown to $161 million — Bailey said the digital exchange will be state-of-the-art and have fewer requirements for the makeup of company boards of directors than other exchanges. TXSE also hopes to capitalize on discontent over new rules and rising fees and share price benchmarks at Nasdaq and NYSE. Much of TXSE’s success will depend on the patience of its investors, Villupuram said. It will take time to convince companies to list themselves on the exchange, but each company that does will build momentum. The speed at which TXSE is able to lure its first 50 to 100 companies to the exchange will be crucial, Villupuram added. “It gives those that are thinking about listing an idea about what it takes to get on the exchange, and it could snowball from there,” Villupuram said. TXSE officials say the exchange’s success will also hinge on the health of the Texas economy. If the economy continues to grow, Texas will continue to attract large companies and financial firms, which TXSE officials can try to recruit into the new exchange. Stock transactions are now largely conducted digitally rather than on a trading floor, but a physical presence near major companies is still crucial for a stock exchange, Villupuram said. “With stocks, the demand, the trading has become automated, electronic, whatever you want to call it, but the supply, the courting of companies to come get listed with us, that is still very much human to human,” Villupuram said. “The landscape is changing” Historically, Dallas was a trading hub due to its central location in the Sun Belt, making it Texas’ primary location for the communications, transportation and finance industries as the state modernized. That has continued as Texas-based corporations grew and Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport became a national travel hub, said Ray Perryman, president of the Waco-based economic research company The Perryman Group. “Dallas is the natural location for a financial center to emerge in this region,” Perryman wrote in an email. Top investment banks such as JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs now have tens of thousands of employees in the region and are continuing to grow. Goldman Sachs is in the midst of building a $500 million tower in downtown Dallas that will host more than 5,000 employees, which will make it the bank’s largest hub outside of New York, according to the company. Charles Schwab moved its headquarters from California to Dallas in 2020. New York has seen just a 16% growth in employment in the investment and securities sector over the last 20 years, while Texas has experienced 111% expansion, Perryman said. The state’s lower cost of living compared to the northeast also makes it appealing to employees like Sasha Stratton, head of risk for Selby Jennings in Dallas and the South. The company assists with recruitment for financial services companies across the country. Stratton moved to Dallas from her home state of New York five years ago, seeking the opportunity to purchase a home and live a higher quality of life for less money. “(Firms) are prioritizing hiring in Dallas over hiring in New York in a lot of instances, which I think is a pretty unique shift,” Stratton said. “That’s driven by the availability of talent, the cost of operations, the availability of real estate and with the Texas Stock Exchange and other exchanges following suit, realizing it’s not a compromise to be building out in Dallas, it’s actually a smart, strategic decision to take advantage of how booming the economy is.” The shift in economic activity to the south paired with the deep pockets of TXSE’s funders suggests the exchange could be a formidable competitor to the NYSE and Nasdaq, Perryman said. TXSE’s launch coupled with the expansion of NYSE and Nasdaq to the area will make it easier for growing Texas companies to access capital, allowing for more expansion and hiring, Perryman added, creating a feedback loop that benefits both the exchanges and the Texas economy as a whole. “New York will likely remain the primary center of equity markets for the time being, but the landscape is changing,” Perryman said.

Ethereum ETFs have already gotten off to a strong start for the week, pulling in $176.6 million during Monday’s trading session, according to data from Farside Investors. Last week, Ethereum funds around the world pulled in $1.48 billion, per a report from CoinShares, marking a substantial comeback after being in the red the week prior. Ethereum got incredibly close to topping $5,000 in late August, when it set a new all-time high of $4,946.05. Ethereum is currently changing hands for $4,560 after having gained more than 10% since last week. That puts it 7.6% away from its all-time high price. Earlier Thursday, ETH rose as high as $4,753, per CoinGecko. Users on Myriad are growing more confident that the upward trend will continue for Ethereum. As of Tuesday morning, 80% of users think ETH will see $5,000 sooner than it could dip to $3,500. That’s a marked uptick in optimism from last week, when users were evenly split on which price Ethereum would see next. Rodriguez-Alarcón, who used to work at BlackRock and JPMorgan, added that risk assets in general have benefited greatly from the monetary policy signals coming from the U.S. Federal Reserve, which next meets at the end of the month to decide on interest rates. “On the macro front, a dovish Fed tilt, ongoing pressure on fiat currencies, and positive momentum in gold could unlock additional flows into risk assets,” he said. “In that environment, Ethereum stands to benefit disproportionately given its foundational role across DeFi, stablecoins, and tokenization infrastructure.” That macroeconomic environment has led to one of the biggest stock rallies in 15 years as investors rush back into emerging markets. “The dollar’s weakness has acted as the spark, but this rally is also about the maturity of emerging markets themselves,” wrote deVere CEO Nigel Green in a note shared with Decrypt. He noted that Brazil, Mexico, and South Africa are all drawing renewed interest from foreign investors. Meanwhile, Ethereum developers are working towards the Fusaka upgrade, which has been called the biggest scaling bet yet for the network. The project’s roadmap says it is planned to arrive before the end of the year. “The upcoming Fusaka upgrade, expected in November, introduces key improvements such as parallel execution in the Ethereum Virtual Machine, a major step toward alleviating scaling bottlenecks in the next growth cycle,” Rodriguez-Alarcón said.

Title: Starbucks’ sweeping store closures aren’t a surprise. Here’s why

By Megan Ulu-Lani Boyanton, The Seattle Times Deanna Meyerhoff, 55, moved to Seattle in 1993. Back then, the expansion of Starbucks was just so tremendous,” she said. Until recently, Meyerhoff would treat her daughter to pink drinks and stop for iced black tea lemonades while on walks with the family dog, she recalls. But those are memories now. Her favorite Starbucks stores in her neighborhood, Haller Lake, recently shuttered as part of a slew of closures announced by the company last week. Living in the coffee giant’s hometown, “it definitely hits differently when it’s a local company,” Meyerhoff said. “It’s a shareholder thing: You grow or you die. And they grew — and, now, they have to shrink back to actually make money.” Meyerhoff isn’t an industry analyst, but her assessment is shared by some who see last week’s $1 billion Starbucks restructuring plan, including layoffs and store closures, as a move to please investors. Like other large coffee chains, Starbucks is trying to stand out among the competition and welcome more customers through its doors all while fighting global and local headwinds — from production costs to President Donald Trump’s tariffs. It has not been easy. In July, Starbucks reported mixed quarterly results, including increased revenue and decreased profit. At $558 million, the company’s profit was almost half of what it reported for the same quarter a year earlier, and earnings per share were 49 cents — a drop from 93 cents for the same period in 2024. At the time, CEO Brian Niccol, less than a year on the job, talked about his experience with turnarounds, adding, “We’re building back a better Starbucks experience and a better business.” The recent changes could be a step toward buoying the business. “We remain committed to returning cash to our shareholders while balancing our investments in our long-term growth strategy,” said Chief Financial Officer Cathy Smith in a statement this week. While Seattle’s coffee lovers might not have paid much attention to industry struggles, Starbucks store closures beginning late last week jolted their attention. Laurie Fryett said she will miss her Mill Creek Town Center location, which shuttered as part of the cull. “I’m disappointed that Starbucks is closing neighborhood locations, especially because, over the years, I’ve found that it’s a great place just to go, relax, connect with friends,” she said. “I know there’s a lot (of Starbucks stores), and it’s probably a hard decision to have to close, but it’s going to affect so many people.” Starbucks declined to share the number of stores slated for closure but confirmed its app is up to date. According to the app, dozens of Seattle-area locations have been impacted, even though some of them appeared to loyal customers to be well-loved. Performance was not the only consideration in the decision-making process. In his announcement of the closures, Niccol said coffeehouses are opened and shuttered for a number of reasons, including financial performance and lease expirations. Fryett, 72, just wants a nearby Starbucks coffee shop with a patio where she can sit and sip hot chocolate with whipped cream in the sunshine. While customers like her hunt for new spots, hundreds of workers will be hunting for gigs. Part of the restructuring plan involved another round of corporate layoffs — 900 last week, on top of 1,100 earlier this year — and the store closures will likely entail more job losses on the retail end. Starbucks told The Seattle Times on Tuesday that it was notifying affected retail workers, and they will either be transferred or extended a severance package. “We’re working hard to offer transfers to nearby locations where possible and will move quickly to help partners understand what opportunities might be available to them,” Niccol said. “For those we can’t immediately place, we’re focused on partner care including comprehensive severance packages.” Starbucks refers to workers as partners. There’s potential for future job opportunities, he added. “We also hope to welcome many of these partners back to Starbucks in the future as new coffeehouses open and the number of partners in each location grows.” Niccol joined Starbucks at a shaky time for the company. In 2024, under then-CEO Laxman Narasimhan, Starbucks’ profits and revenue had plummeted, which led to “the biggest fall in the stock since the start of the pandemic,” according to Bloomberg. Niccol had handled fast food companies in crisis before. A former leader at both Taco Bell and Pizza Hut, he was brought into the fold at Chipotle in 2018 after the chain’s customers fell ill from food-related illnesses. After almost seven years with the company, Niccol was credited with doubling its revenue — a veritable success story. At Starbucks, the hope was Niccol could appease the company’s shareholders. “His retail excellence and track record in delivering extraordinary shareholder value recognizes the critical human element it takes to lead a culture and values driven enterprise,” longtime former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz said in a statement announcing Niccol’s transition. As of June, the major shareholders in the publicly traded company were investment management companies: The Vanguard Group with 9.5% of shares, BlackRock with 4.5%, State Street with 4.1%, Goode Capital Management with 2.1%, and Invesco with 1.9%, according to financial services company The Motley Fool. It also listed Schultz as holding 1.9% of shares. On top of investor expectations, Niccol also has had to contend with market dynamics rocking the coffee industry. The underlying cost of production is high, the effects of the COVID pandemic are still being felt, there’s more competition in the industry, and U.S. tariffs on major coffee-producing countries are causing strain, said Peter Roberts, professor of organization and management at Emory University’s Goizueta Business School. And so Niccol’s “Back to Starbucks” plan was born shortly after he took over in September 2024. He aimed to focus on “empowering” baristas, meeting customer expectations and improving the experience at stores through a series of steps that included streamlining pricing and phasing out mobile orders. In announcing the store closures last week, Niccol placed it squarely as part of his Back to Starbucks plan. “Over the next 12 months, we also plan to uplift more than 1,000 locations to introduce greater texture, warmth, and layered design,” he said. Chris Deferio, president of Keys to the Shop, a coffee industry consulting company and podcast, depicted the coffee giant as trying to move away from the “transactional” environment at its stores and instead embrace the coffeehouse ambience. “The methodology of trying to get there, though, I feel is a little faulty,” he added. Deferio said Starbucks is competing against other large coffee chains and basing corporate decisions off of moves made by those companies. Deferio believes Starbucks should focus on training managers and meeting the needs of workers in order to improve the customer experience — and ultimately see the results it wants. “Based on the moves that they’ve made so far, it amounts to an aestheticism but not to a substantive experiential change for the people that go to the stores,” he said. “It’s just new paint on the same thing, and we’re supposed to accept it as a huge turnaround.” Over decades, Starbucks focused on expanding into foreign markets, according to The Strategy Institute, a business strategy certification program provider. Since 1996, with the opening of its first international location outside North America, Starbucks has utilized three approaches — wholly owned subsidiaries, joint ventures and licensing — to expand its global empire, The Strategy Institute said. Out of over 41,000 stores around the world, the U.S. and China made up 61% of the company’s portfolio, Starbucks said at the end of the third quarter. At that time, more than 17,000 locations were operating on U.S. soil, while China was home to almost 8,000 stores. In the third quarter, global and U.S. store sales both fell 2%, but, notably, Chinese store sales jumped 2%. The company is in the process of finding potential buyers for stakes of its Chinese business, which is vying against national powerhouse Luckin Coffee for customers in the Asian country. Roberts, the professor, reasoned that the North American store closures could be a move by Starbucks to address saturation. “I would place a fair bet that says there’s more Starbucks saturation in U.S. cities than elsewhere, and that probably explains a little bit of this closing and opening” of stores, Roberts said. For Deferio, president of Keys to the Shop, the closures come down to profitability. “What I think is happening is they’re closing these stores because they’re not profitable,” he said, “and that means people aren’t spending their money as much as they used to in a Starbucks store — in those Starbucks stores in particular. ©2025 The Seattle Times.

And they grew — and, now, they have to shrink back to actually make money.” Meyerhoff isn’t an industry analyst, but her assessment is shared by some who see last week’s $1 billion Starbucks restructuring plan, including layoffs and store closures, as a move to please investors. Like other large coffee chains, Starbucks is trying to stand out among the competition and welcome more customers through its doors all while fighting global and local headwinds — from production costs to President Donald Trump’s tariffs. It has not been easy. In July, Starbucks reported mixed quarterly results, including increased revenue and decreased profit. At $558 million, the company’s profit was almost half of what it reported for the same quarter a year earlier, and earnings per share were 49 cents — a drop from 93 cents for the same period in 2024. At the time, CEO Brian Niccol, less than a year on the job, talked about his experience with turnarounds, adding, “We’re building back a better Starbucks experience and a better business.” The recent changes could be a step toward buoying the business. “We remain committed to returning cash to our shareholders while balancing our investments in our long-term growth strategy,” said Chief Financial Officer Cathy Smith in a statement this week. While Seattle’s coffee lovers might not have paid much attention to industry struggles, Starbucks store closures beginning late last week jolted their attention. Laurie Fryett said she will miss her Mill Creek Town Center location, which shuttered as part of the cull. “I’m disappointed that Starbucks is closing neighborhood locations, especially because, over the years, I’ve found that it’s a great place just to go, relax, connect with friends,” she said. “I know there’s a lot (of Starbucks stores), and it’s probably a hard decision to have to close, but it’s going to affect so many people.” Starbucks declined to share the number of stores slated for closure but confirmed its app is up to date. According to the app, dozens of Seattle-area locations have been impacted, even though some of them appeared to loyal customers to be well-loved. Performance was not the only consideration in the decision-making process. In his announcement of the closures, Niccol said coffeehouses are opened and shuttered for a number of reasons, including financial performance and lease expirations. Fryett, 72, just wants a nearby Starbucks coffee shop with a patio where she can sit and sip hot chocolate with whipped cream in the sunshine. While customers like her hunt for new spots, hundreds of workers will be hunting for gigs. Part of the restructuring plan involved another round of corporate layoffs — 900 last week, on top of 1,100 earlier this year — and the store closures will likely entail more job losses on the retail end. Starbucks told The Seattle Times on Tuesday that it was notifying affected retail workers, and they will either be transferred or extended a severance package. “We’re working hard to offer transfers to nearby locations where possible and will move quickly to help partners understand what opportunities might be available to them,” Niccol said. “For those we can’t immediately place, we’re focused on partner care including comprehensive severance packages.” Starbucks refers to workers as partners. There’s potential for future job opportunities, he added. “We also hope to welcome many of these partners back to Starbucks in the future as new coffeehouses open and the number of partners in each location grows.” Niccol joined Starbucks at a shaky time for the company. In 2024, under then-CEO Laxman Narasimhan, Starbucks’ profits and revenue had plummeted, which led to “the biggest fall in the stock since the start of the pandemic,” according to Bloomberg. Niccol had handled fast food companies in crisis before. A former leader at both Taco Bell and Pizza Hut, he was brought into the fold at Chipotle in 2018 after the chain’s customers fell ill from food-related illnesses. After almost seven years with the company, Niccol was credited with doubling its revenue — a veritable success story. At Starbucks, the hope was Niccol could appease the company’s shareholders. “His retail excellence and track record in delivering extraordinary shareholder value recognizes the critical human element it takes to lead a culture and values driven enterprise,” longtime former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz said in a statement announcing Niccol’s transition. As of June, the major shareholders in the publicly traded company were investment management companies: The Vanguard Group with 9.5% of shares, BlackRock with 4.5%, State Street with 4.1%, Goode Capital Management with 2.1%, and Invesco with 1.9%, according to financial services company The Motley Fool. It also listed Schultz as holding 1.9% of shares. On top of investor expectations, Niccol also has had to contend with market dynamics rocking the coffee industry. The underlying cost of production is high, the effects of the COVID pandemic are still being felt, there’s more competition in the industry, and U.S. tariffs on major coffee-producing countries are causing strain, said Peter Roberts, professor of organization and management at Emory University’s Goizueta Business School. And so Niccol’s “Back to Starbucks” plan was born shortly after he took over in September 2024. He aimed to focus on “empowering” baristas, meeting customer expectations and improving the experience at stores through a series of steps that included streamlining pricing and phasing out mobile orders. In announcing the store closures last week, Niccol placed it squarely as part of his Back to Starbucks plan. “Over the next 12 months, we also plan to uplift more than 1,000 locations to introduce greater texture, warmth, and layered design,” he said. Chris Deferio, president of Keys to the Shop, a coffee industry consulting company and podcast, depicted the coffee giant as trying to move away from the “transactional” environment at its stores and instead embrace the coffeehouse ambience. “The methodology of trying to get there, though, I feel is a little faulty,” he added. Deferio said Starbucks is competing against other large coffee chains and basing corporate decisions off of moves made by those companies. Deferio believes Starbucks should focus on training managers and meeting the needs of workers in order to improve the customer experience — and ultimately see the results it wants. “Based on the moves that they’ve made so far, it amounts to an aestheticism but not to a substantive experiential change for the people that go to the stores,” he said. “It’s just new paint on the same thing, and we’re supposed to accept it as a huge turnaround.” Over decades, Starbucks focused on expanding into foreign markets, according to The Strategy Institute, a business strategy certification program provider. Since 1996, with the opening of its first international location outside North America, Starbucks has utilized three approaches — wholly owned subsidiaries, joint ventures and licensing — to expand its global empire, The Strategy Institute said. Out of over 41,000 stores around the world, the U.S. and China made up 61% of the company’s portfolio, Starbucks said at the end of the third quarter. At that time, more than 17,000 locations were operating on U.S. soil, while China was home to almost 8,000 stores. In the third quarter, global and U.S. store sales both fell 2%, but, notably, Chinese store sales jumped 2%. The company is in the process of finding potential buyers for stakes of its Chinese business, which is vying against national powerhouse Luckin Coffee for customers in the Asian country. Roberts, the professor, reasoned that the North American store closures could be a move by Starbucks to address saturation. “I would place a fair bet that says there’s more Starbucks saturation in U.S. cities than elsewhere, and that probably explains a little bit of this closing and opening” of stores, Roberts said. For Deferio, president of Keys to the Shop, the closures come down to profitability. “What I think is happening is they’re closing these stores because they’re not profitable,” he said, “and that means people aren’t spending their money as much as they used to in a Starbucks store — in those Starbucks stores in particular. ©2025 The Seattle Times.
