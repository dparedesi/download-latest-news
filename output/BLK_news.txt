The biggest story in crypto this year has been the approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, which entered the market in January and have been a wild success. Almost a year in, these products have helped propel the once-fringe crypto industry into the mainstream and expanded global adoption, a new report from blockchain data analysis firm Chainalysis says. The arrival of traditional financial institutions has transformed the industry and solidified the United States as a dominant force. “It’s just fundamentally changed the scene in the North American setting, but with global ramifications,” Eric Jardine, Chainalysis’ cyber crimes research lead, told Fortune. North America makes up 22.5% of global crypto activity, with an estimated $1.3 trillion in on-chain value, according to this year’s “Geography of Cryptocurrency” report (Mexico is not included in this section of the report). The introduction of exchange-traded funds marked a key inflection point for the crypto industry, Jardine said, codifying a place for established legacy financial entities like BlackRock, Fidelity and Goldman Sachs. A striking 70% of crypto transfers in North America exceeded $1 million, “reflecting the growing influence of major financial players in the region’s crypto market,” the report said. The approval of Bitcoin ETFs in January legitimized the currency, allowing institutions to participate through a well-defined instrument and roping in a new group of participants, Jardine said. “So once that clarity was provided through a decision by the SEC, you end up with this whole new actor class being able and willing to participate and they wouldn’t have been absent that, ” he said. On a global scale, Jardine said that North American dominance of the crypto market could be good news for areas of the world that were early adopters. “It might translate through in a price mechanism where assets that had been previously bought and moved on-chain in years past, all of a sudden, your big institutional players are bringing lots of liquidity with them that might inflate price over the longer term,” he said. Jardine also sees North American dominance driving global adoption at a grassroots level. “For example, what we’re likely to see is other big institutions, traditional financial institutions, in other places, they’re all likely to start to participate in this asset class as well, and it’s all kind of a percolating legitimization effect,” he said. “Where the U.S. has now said, Bitcoin is an asset class in its own right… And that’s just going to open up adoption for more people.” Outpacing the wildly popular gold ETF within its first hundred days, the spot Bitcoin ETF became the most popular ETF in history. “This asset class is here, and they’re basically going to be here for the long haul, from everything we can tell from the data so far,” Jardine said. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Shayne Bolton’s journey from South Africa can see him flourish with Connacht
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/rugby/2024/10/17/shayne-boltons-journey-from-south-africa-can-see-him-flourish-with-connacht/
Time Published: 2024-10-17T05:00:00Z
Full Content:
By his own admission Shayne Bolton didn’t have too many options in South Africa when the then Connacht head coach Andy Friend, aware of his Irish qualifications, contacted him in 2021. Then 20, Bolton was sure of one thing: at college he was far more interested in playing rugby than studying. “I knew I wanted to go somewhere and pursue my dreams,” said Bolton when reflecting on his journey this week ahead of Saturday’s URC meeting with Leinster at the Dexcom Stadium (kick-off 7.35pm). That journey began when he flew to Ireland in June 2021. “I was so nervous. It was my first time travelling alone. It was in Covid time. The plane was empty. I had my own row. It was crazy, masks on and couldn’t really speak to anybody. The airports were so quiet. I didn’t know where to go or what to do. “Then I had to quarantine for 14 days in a hotel in Dublin because I was coming from a red-listed country. At least I had a bit of gym equipment that Connacht set up. I was on FaceTime all the time talking to family and friends back home. But I made it through that, and I was excited to get stuck in and start training and learning.” It was a long way from Pretoria. “I got a few scholarships and bursaries from bigger schools but I’m the youngest child [of five], so my parents didn’t want to send me to boarding school. I went to the school around the corner and I think it was the best decision my parents ever made. It was really fun. I loved my rugby there, had great friends.” He played for the Blue Bulls under-16s and under-18s and had an academy contract for two seasons with the Cheetahs which entailed a scholarship, but he wasn’t offered an extension. He owes his Irish qualifications, his new life and pro career to his grandmother, Noreen Stapleton, from Blackrock in Dublin. “I’m very close to my gran. She lives close by to my parents in South Africa, and I saw her every Sunday or every second Sunday, and I was always aware that my family comes from here. Her parents died when she was young in a car crash, so she was sent to England for a couple of years and then to Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe, where she spent most of her life.” Bolton has strong hints of an Irish accent now. While that doesn’t come out when he speaks Afrikaans with friends, when he speaks English: “I get a few messages, especially from my [three] brothers.” Initially though, Bolton took “a few months” adapting to his new life in Galway. “I was struggling to find accommodation, but the team environment was helpful. Every weekend, every off day there’d be somebody asking me to come for coffee with them. Everyone was so inviting and now I feel like one of them. I’ve made great friends here. I’m enjoying life now.” Coming from college rugby he also admits he had plenty to learn about a professional set-up. “I’ve had so much help from the players, the coaches and everyone around. When I came over I was mostly a centre but I moved to wing then, and so I had to learn, not a new position, but one I hadn’t played much in.” As his young body grew into his 100kg frame there were injuries too, but a run of six games around the festive period led to a two-year contract extension. Bolton was also included in the Emerging Ireland squad, only for a knee laceration in Connacht’s opening game against Munster to force him out of that tour. Many talented rugby players in South Africa miss the net but Bolton isn’t the first example of an unpolished gem who can flourish in the Irish system. His try in Belfast last week was a routine finish but he had several good involvements and despite plenty of options out wide he is likely to be given a third start against Leinster. “We’re really excited by Shayne,” says head coach Pete Wilkins. “We plucked him out of a backwater in South Africa and saw him as a project.” Such is Connacht’s midfield they tried the 24-year-old as “a power winger” and he has thrived with the additional space. “But there’s more to come from him in the development of his kicking game and his ability to read and find space. I’m trying to play him a fair bit because just that time in the saddle is an important bit of his education. We’ll all be watching him with interest.” They won’t be alone.

Bajaj Auto led the decline, falling 7.53 per cent despite better-than-expected Q2 results, followed by Hero MotoCorp dropping 3.75 per cent. Other auto majors M&M and Eicher Motors also declined by 2.08 per cent and 1.87 per cent respectively. Technology stocks showed strength with Infosys gaining 1.49 per cent ahead of its quarterly results, while Wipro rose 1.06 per cent. Banking major SBI advanced 1.17 per cent, and infrastructure giant L&T gained 0.80 per cent. “The weakness would increase if it breaks the levels of 24,700/80,600,” said Shrikant Chouhan, Head Equity Research, Kotak Securities, noting that the market witnessed consistent selling pressure at higher levels. Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) remained net sellers, offloading equities worth ₹3,436 crore on October 16, while Domestic Institutional Investors bought shares worth ₹2,256.29 crore. Global factors provided mixed cues, with US markets reaching new highs overnight. “Major U.S. stock indexes bounced back from a selloff in the prior session to finish higher on Wednesday, buoyed by strong corporate-earnings results from names like Morgan Stanley and United Airlines,” noted Deepak Jasani, Head of Retail Research at HDFC Securities. In commodities, gold rallied toward fresh record highs as investors focused on the upcoming US election. Oil prices steadied at $74/bbl following previous day’s losses of over 4 per cent amid easing geopolitical concerns and weakening Chinese demand. “Market is expected to open positively due to a rally in global markets, spurred by strong quarterly results from US listed Morgan Stanley and an optimistic earnings forecast,” said Vikas Jain, Head of Research at Reliance Securities. The market awaits crucial quarterly results from prominent companies including Axis Bank, Infosys, Wipro, and Nestle India. Additionally, BlackRock Inc. is reportedly in talks with Mukesh Ambani’s Jio Financial Services to establish a private credit venture in India. “Nifty is consolidated between 24850 – 25250 level,” added Jain, suggesting a range-bound trading session ahead. Technical analysts advise caution, with Sameet Chavan of Angel One noting that “a break below 24900 could open doors for further weakness, potentially testing the 24700 level.” The market sentiment remains fragile due to persistent FII selling, with October witnessing outflows of ₹67,300 crore, alongside ongoing Middle East tensions and concerns over China’s economic outlook.

Title: Dogecoin Makes Grayscale’s List Of Potential Crypto Products, Is A DOGE ETF Coming?
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-grayscale-doge-etf/
Time Published: 2024-10-17T04:00:40Z
Full Content:
Crypto asset management giant Grayscale has recently announced its consideration of expanding its offerings to include products based on the popular meme cryptocurrency, Dogecoin. In a recent blog post, Grayscale highlighted that Dogecoin has caught the company’s attention as a potential asset for future investment products. As the king of meme coins, a Dogecoin-based crypto product would be a turning point for the entire meme coin niche. This extensive portfolio includes top-tier digital assets such as Bitcoin, the number one cryptocurrency by market cap, alongside a variety of innovative and emerging tokens like Filecoin (FIL), Bittensor (TAO), and Decentraland (MANA), to name a few. Grayscale’s involvement in such a wide spectrum of cryptocurrencies makes it the most actively engaged asset manager within the digital asset space. However, despite its diverse offerings, the asset manager has yet to consider products based on a meme cryptocurrency until now. According to the blog post, Dogecoin is one of a few cryptocurrencies currently under consideration for Grayscale. Grayscale broke down its list of cryptocurrencies under consideration into five primary categories: currencies, smart contract platforms, financials, culture, and utilities. Most of the assets under review fall within the categories of smart contracts and utilities, which focus on blockchain technology innovations and practical applications. However, Dogecoin stands out, as it has been placed in the “consumption and culture” category, which covers cryptocurrencies that cater to consumer-driven activities. Grayscale’s consideration of a Dogecoin product shows the increasing recognition of meme-based cryptocurrencies. Until recently, Grayscale was the largest crypto asset manager in terms of investments for many years. However, Grayscale was recently unseated by BlackRock after the latter’s Spot Bitcoin and Spot Ethereum ETFs exceeded Grayscale’s funds. Nevertheless, a Dogecoin ETF would open the door for huge capital inflows from traditional investors, who have previously been reluctant to engage with meme coins. This, in turn, could help legitimize Dogecoin and other meme coins like Shiba Inu and Floki. On the other hand, the Dogecoin blockchain has been infused with growing activity in the past seven days. According to recent on-chain data, this surge in network participation has pushed the number of daily active addresses on the Dogecoin network to its highest point in eight months. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.1188 and has increased by 2.4% in the past 24 hours. Notably, the Dogecoin trading volume has increased by 42% in the same time frame, which also points to a surge in activity on the blockchain. The Dogecoin price has also increased by 16% in the past 30 days and is now on the verge of breaking through an order block of $0.12 on October 1. A break above this level would put Dogecoin towards a minimum target of $0.129. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

On Day 1, the mega IPO was subscribed 0.42 times or 42 per cent. Hyundai Motor India’s mega IPO, part of Hyundai Motor Group, is entirely an offer for sale by up to 14.22 crore shares by Hyundai Motor Company. The issue size of ₹27,870 crore (at the upper end) is the largest ever in the Indian primary market. The price band for the initial share sale has been fixed at ₹1,865-1,960, with a face value of ₹10. Minimum bids can be made for seven shares and multiples of 7 thereafter. The Hyundai Motor India IPO has reserved 50 per cent of the issue size for qualified institutional buyers (QIB), 15 per cent for non-institutional Institutional Investors (HNIs), and 35 per cent for retail investors. The employee reservation segment comprises a maximum of 778,400 equity shares, and employees will receive a discount of ₹186 a share. The portion of QIB subscribed 0.58 times, HNIs 0.26 times, and retail investors 0.38 times. However, the silver lining is the employees, as the quota reserved for them received bids 1.31 times. As the issue is entirely an offer for sales by Hyundai Motor, the funds raised will not go to company. As part of the IPO, the company on Monday raised ₹8,315 crore from anchor investors. In consultation with book-running lead managers, the company allotted 4.2 crore shares to anchor investors at ₹1,960 a share. Prominent global firms such as Baillie Gifford, Vanguard, the City of New York Group Trust, Moorea Fund, BlackRock, Aegon Investment Management, Schroder, and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board have participated in the anchor book. Several domestic asset management and insurance companies, including SBI Mutual Fund, Nippon Life India, Kotak Mutual Fund, and HDFC Life Insurance Company, also made significant investments in Hyundai’s IPO. ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund and HDFC Asset Management Company each acquired shares worth ₹366.5 crore through various schemes. According to Hyundai’s filing, out of the total 4.2 crore shares allocated, 1.46 crore shares were designated for 21 domestic mutual funds across 83 schemes. “India is the most exciting market in the world and Hyundai has been successful for the last 26 years. We are currently the second largest Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) in the country and we believe this is the right time to go forward to Indianise our operations and become a home brand,” Unsoo Kim, President of Hyundai Motor India, Middle East & Africa Strategic Region, told businessline during IPO launch meet. “The IPO will ensure that the company is more dedicated to success in India and will provide an opportunity for local and global investors to add in our growth story. We will continue to pursue global standards and practices in terms of governance,” he further said. Comments BACK TO TOP Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

Title: ‘I don’t have an Irish accent in Afrikaans’ – Connacht’s Shayne Bolton eyes Ireland spot

Connacht's Shayne Bolton ahead of the URC match against Ulster at Kingspan Stadium in Belfast last week. Photo: Ramsey Cardy/Sportsfile The pandemic was at its height when Shayne Bolton arrived in Ireland, sequestered in a Dublin Airport hotel and left to his own devices for a fortnight. Andy Friend had spotted the South African winger playing college rugby in Bloemfontein and decided to offer him a route to the pro ranks at Connacht. Bolton’s grandmother Noirin Stapleton hailed from Blackrock, Co Dublin and thus he was a player of interest. After his quarantine, he arrived into a professional set-up for the first time and tried to assimilate in a time of restrictions and face masks. Three years on, the 24-year-old beams a broad smile and speaks with a broader Irish accent as he considers his progress. Had a nasty gash to his leg not prevented him from travelling, he’d have gone back to Bloemfontein as part of the Emerging Ireland squad last month and there’s a reasonable chance he could make the full squad for November. An abrasive, powerful winger who has been consistently good for his province for a year now, he would have no doubt caught Andy Farrell’s eye when standing up to his son Owen when Connacht played Saracens last season. ​He’s come a long way. “I was so nervous,” he says of his initial trip to Ireland. “It was my first time travelling alone too. It was in Covid time, the plane was empty. I had my own row, it was all open. It was crazy, masks on and couldn’t really speak to anybody. “The airports were so quiet, I didn’t know where to go or what to do. I was so nervous travelling on my own and then I had to quarantine for 14 days in a hotel in Dublin because I was coming from a red-listed country. “I was in the hotel for two weeks on my own. At least I had a bit of gym equipment that Connacht sent up. “That was really tough at the start, I was just on FaceTime all the time talking to family and friends back home. But I made it through that and I was excited to get stuck in and start training and learning. “It did take a good few months, at the start it wasn’t very easy. “I was struggling to find accommodation and that kind of stuff, but I settled in quite quickly with the lads, the team environment was helpful. Every weekend, every off day there’d be somebody asking me to come for coffee with them. “Everyone was so inviting and now I feel like one of them. I’ve made great friends here, I’m enjoying life now.” His Irish accent passes them by back home because it doesn’t seep into his native tongue. “I don’t think they know too much because I speak Afrikaans to my friends so I don’t have an Irish accent in my Afrikaans language. When I do speak English, I get a few messages, especially from my brothers,” he says. “I’m very close to my gran, she lives close by to my parents in South Africa and I saw her every Sunday or every second Sunday. She comes from Ireland and I was always aware that my family comes from here. It was really exciting when I got the opportunity, a lot of people don’t get the opportunity, so I was really happy and was looking forward to trying to make a difference this side. “My granny’s name is Noirin Stapleton from Blackrock in Dublin. I think her parents died when she was young in a car crash, so she was sent to England for a couple of years and then she was sent to Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe, where she spent most of her life.” The youngest of a family of five, Bolton went to a local school in Pretoria and played underage rugby with the Blue Bulls before joining the Cheetahs academy and attending the Free State University. After two years, he lost his academy spot and remained in Bloemfontein to study. Adapting to life as a professional in Ireland was tough. “I came in from college rugby, so I had a lot to learn about professional rugby, a professional set-up and it took longer than I expected when I came over,” he says. “I’ve had so much help from the players, my friends, the coaches and everyone around. “They’ve helped me grow, when I came over I was mostly a centre but I moved to wing then and so I had to learn, not a new position, but one I hadn’t played much in. “I had to learn that quite fast. All credit to the players around me and the coaches.” He’s a quick learner and, having switched to wing from centre, has become a key man in a talented Connacht back three. On Saturday, he’ll take on Leinster and that represents a real chance to catch Farrell’s eye again. “We scored a good few tries in most games, four or five tries a game, so our attack and everything is working perfectly, we’re very positive,” he adds. “We’ll be looking to take the game with both hands and give it our best.”

Sandip Raichura, CEO - Retail Broking and Distribution, Director - PL Broking and Distribution. “Gold has , since our previous piece indicating $2550 as a crucial level, held on to minor gains in the background of the Israeli conflict and the shift in global monetary policy, with major central banks embarking on rate cuts. To add to this mix is the tight presidential race between Trump and Harris in the US – with the outcome too uncertain, markets are becoming risk-averse on the margin. With increased risk aversion across the globe, , gold’s attractiveness as a safe-haven asset has come to the fore. Although China has paused its gold purchases in the second quarter, it has showed no signs of selling reserves in the following months while other central banks continue to accumulate including our own. As we mentioned previously, the $2,550 per ounce level as a pivotal point for potential pullbacks. Should prices revisit this level, traders might find buying opportunities for mid-term bullish positions. These support levels are expected to continue to hold especially as the fourth quarter presents a perfect geopolitical recipe for gold’s performance. The risk is that technical indications suggest gold prices as being significantly overbought with both the weekly and monthly RSIs lodged above 80 levels or thereabouts – history has shown that these RSI levels result in a sharp turn in gold prices. Despite this history though, we remain bullish with a stop placed at around 2602 levels. The movement in the DXY, which has climbed up in the last week, remains a critical sign of the times to come for precious metals – a rise here is negative for gold.” Investment banking firm Morgan Stanley on Wednesday bought shares of Titagarh Rail Systems for over Rs 85 crore through an open market transaction. Titagarh shares surged 5.67% on the NSE to ₹1,197.20 Macquarie Following strong 13% relative rebound in 3Q’24, MSCI China has lost ~3%-4% in the first two weeks of October. While it still leaves the index up more than 6% vs MXEF YTD, there is a noticeable erosion in investor enthusiasm. On the other hand, India’s underperformance has subsided, and partially reversed, with overall YTD returns still in the positive territory (up ~7%-8%). India vs China remains the single most important question facing EM investors, and it is becoming harder to make this choice. First, India’s equities are facing triple negatives: weakening GDP growth, high EPS expectations (~17%) and historically the highest multiples (~23x). From the flow perspective, while domestic liquidity is continuing to build, the last two weeks have seen meaningful (US$7bn) net foreign equity outflows. Finally, despite some recent erosion, MSCI India is still seating on ~70% cumulative four year outperformance. Second, on the other side, investors expect that China will ultimately embark on meaningful stimuli that will not only underwrite ‘24 growth but extend into ‘25-26. Although few believe that China will address its deeply imbedded structural challenges, at the very least, it should be able to place the floor under nominal and real GDP, helping corporates to deliver something close to the current (10%-11%) EPS estimates. Also, there is a perception that the government is finally focusing on the economy, and hence, it is likely to underplay political, geopolitical and regulatory issues. Finally, MXCN remains relatively cheap (~10x), and is seating on ~35% cumulative four year underperformance Nestle India consolidated net profit at Rs 899 crore versus Rs 908 crore. Total sales at Rs 5,074.76 crore vs Rs 5,009.5 crore.

This quarter, 5 of our top 12 brands grew at double-digit. However, some key brands witnessed pressure due to softer consumer demand and we focus on them and have in place robust action plans.

Title: Report: Kamala Harris Would Import 12.3 Million Migrants
URL: https://www.breitbart.com/immigration/2024/10/16/report-kamala-harris-would-import-12-3-million-migrants/
Time Published: 2024-10-16T21:22:43Z

President Kamala Harris could import almost four million migrants in 2025 — and 12.3 million migrants during her four years — by continuing President Joe Biden’s policies, according to a report by pro-migration advocates. The huge and disruptive inflow of migrants, however, will only raise annual economic growth by one cent for every $10, says the report by the business-funded Brookings Institution. “We expect net immigration to be significantly higher under a Harris administration than a second Trump administration,” the report says it describes four alternative scenarios: Net migration in the Harris, high scenario is 3.7 million in 2025 and cumulates to 12.3 million from 2025–2028. … Unlike the other scenarios, the Trump, low scenario yields net negative migration. Net migration is around -740,000 in 2025 and -230,000 in 2026 … Cumulative net migration over the four years is around 410,000. A 2025 inflow of 3.7 million legal, illegal, quasi-legal, and temporary migrants would deliver one migrant for every American birth. So far, the Harris campaign has signaled she will continue the high-migration policies set by Biden. Overall, the report says Harris’s high migration policies would grow the U.S. population by 15 million during her four years, or roughly three million new households. But Trump’s low migration policies would grow the population by almost five million via the rules set for legal migration by Congress in 1990, says the report. The report claims Trump’s focus on Americans will contract the economy by four cents in every $10 during 2025. The report does not mention the expected rise in ordinary Americans’ salaries and wages in a national labor market. Nor does it mention the pro-family, pro-birthrate impact as housing drops in price once migrants exit. It also ignores the likely civic gains from reduced diversity in the United States, the reduced damage to migrant-sending countries, and the reduced migration chaos and deaths south of the border. The damage to foreigners was outlined by The Atlantic — a pro-migration website — when it described the many migrant deaths in the Darien Gap between Colombia and Panama: The morgue is next to the hospital kitchen. [Panamanian doctor Luis Antonio] Moreno said the stench was often intolerable, even before the day this spring when he discovered that the air conditioner had gone out and the bodies inside were decomposing. In March 2023, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), which has a program to help families track down loved ones who have gone missing while migrating, built a mausoleum in the local cemetery with space for hundreds of bodies, and it’s quickly filling. At a recent burial ceremony, municipal workers wearing hazmat suits placed 12 white body bags into graves. Ten of the bags were labeled desconocido, or “unknown.” One bore the name of a man from Venezuela whose family had confirmed his identity. Just before the last body bag, which was also the smallest, went into the mausoleum, an ICRC worker opened it and placed a dog tag on the wrist of the 8-month-old Haitian girl inside. Instead, the Brookings report focuses on macroeconomics. Without more migration in 2025, “The result would be that investment and hiring would fall more than otherwise after a drop in consumer demand,” the Brookings report said. Also, Because immigrants who come to the U.S. between 2025 and 2034 would require equipment and infrastructure to effectively do their jobs, we expect … Investors would receive greater capital income as a result. The report downplays the likely business reforms that would be triggered by Trump’s reduced inflow of migrants. “I can argue, in the developed countries, the big winners are the countries that have shrinking populations,” Larry Fink, the founder of the $10 trillion Blackrock investment company, said at a pro-globalist event hosted by the World Economic Forum in Saudi Arabia. He continued: That’s something that most people never talked about. We always used to think [a] shrinking population is a cause for negative [economic] growth. But in my conversations with the leadership of these large, developed countries [such as China, and Japan] that have xenophobic anti-immigration policies, they don’t allow anybody to come in — [so they have] shrinking demographics — these countries will rapidly develop robotics and AI and technology … If a promise of all that transforms productivity, which most of us think it will [emphasis added] — we’ll be able to elevate the standard living in countries, the standard of living for individuals, even with shrinking populations. Companies and politicians will also be pressured to find and train the roughly five million “prime age” American men who have been sidelined by the easy-migration policies since at least 2000. People say, “Well, Americans won’t do those [low-status, low-wage] jobs.” Trump’s running mate, JD Vance, told a surprised New York Times journalist, adding: [But] Americans won’t do those jobs for below-the-table wages. They won’t do those jobs for non-living wages … they will just do those jobs at certain wages. Think about the perspective of an American company. I want them to go searching in their own country for their own [sidelined] citizens, sometimes people who may be struggling with addiction or trauma, get them re-engaged in American society. We cannot have an entire American business community that is giving up on American workers and then importing millions of illegal laborers. Trump’s reform would also help American families buy homes. For example, Harris has promised to spend $40 billion to help the real estate industry build three million homes during her first term. But her likely inflow of 12.3 million migrants would likely fill up those homes, leaving American families back at Square One. Trump’s low-migration reforms would also be good for white-collar Americans. UnderMayorkas’s rules, C-suite executives are allowed to import huge numbers of disposable, compliant, and cheap visa workers — such as H-1B workers — for the white-collar jobs needed by U.S. graduates. If Trump reduces the inflow of foreign graduates, the executives would be forced to share profits and workplace power with free-speaking American professionals. Trump’s cutbacks would reverse the federal government’s post-1990 economic strategy of Extraction Migration, which seeks to grow the U.S. consumer economy for investors by pulling human resources — disposable workers, government-funded consumers, and apartment-sharing renters — from poor countries. That investor-first policy is strongly backed by President Joe Biden’s Cuban-born, pro-migration border chief, Alejandro Mayorkas. He repeatedly describes himself as a moral champion for migrants because of his migrant parents, his sympathy for migrants, and his support for “equity” between Americans and foreigners. But Breitbart News covers the sexual trafficking and labor abuse of children and youths enabled by Mayorkas. Breitbart News also covers the thousands of migrant deaths and massive foreign destruction encouraged by Mayrokas and his Extraction Migration economic strategy.

Title: Coinbase shares up 27% in October as Bitcoin rallies to $68,000

The crypto industry’s flagship company is on a roll, benefiting from a sector wide rally that is pushing the price of Bitcoin close to its all-time high. So far this month,Coinbase stock is up around 27% this month, going from $165 to $210. Coinbase shares serve as a surrogate for the broader crypto market because the stock typically rises alongside Bitcoin prices. Bitcoin rallied 15% after slumping below $60,000 in the first part of “Uptober,” a nickname for the currency’s historically fruitful month. The broader crypto market is up 4% since October 1, according to the Coindesk 20 Index, while the S&P 500 is up 2%. Coinbase shares have made a comeback this year after reaching an all-time low of $33 at the beginning of 2023. This year’s high of $265 was reached in March around the time Bitcoin hit its all-time high of $73,000. Shares are up 184% since October last year and 30% over the past 30 days. Last month, Coinbase shares jumped almost 7% after the Fed cut interest rates and investors flocked back to crypto. Bitcoin has risen 9% over the past seven days, alongside other cryptocurrencies including Dogecoin which is up 17%, Solana which is up 8%, and Ethereum which is up 7%. The latest bull run has resulted in crypto exchanges conducting a flood of liquidations, primarily of short positions. Over the past day, centralized exchanges saw $285 million of liquidations, with $90 million coming from Bitcoin specifically. Meanwhile, spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds have seen large inflows this week. BTC ETFs inflows totaled $555 million on Sunday and $371 million on Monday after seeing outflows late last week, according to SoSoValue data. BlackRock and Fidelity saw the largest amount of purchases at $640 million this week. Bitcoin and the broader crypto market are likely to experience volatility as the presidential election approaches with expectations that prices will spike if Trump looks poised to win. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

It’s a really nice patch with lots of stuff to look forward to.SUPERINTENDENT STRANGE THOMASMy main is sitting at about ilevel 606.

Without doing Mythic, I mean.To quote Principal Skinner: “Yes!”Our friend SJHawk covered this really nicely in the responses, so I’m just going to highlight his super useful post for people who are in the same situation as you (I am one of them!):Carved Crests – LFR Silken Court/Queen Ansurek, Renown levels, Normal Raid, Low M+ keys (2/3), Consolation Token x1 from Vault, Trade in 90 Weathered Crests once all pieces are 593+Runed Crests – Normal Silken Court/Queen Ansurek, Heroic Raid, Mid M+ Keys (4-7), Consolation Token x2 from Vault, Trade in 90 Carved Crests once all pieces are 606+Gilded Crests – Heroic Silken Court/Queen Ansurek, Mythic Raid, High M+ Keys (8+), Trade in 90 Runed Crests once all pieces are 619+The higher crests from the last two raid bosses are in addition to the crests that raid difficulty gives normally.So yeah, 606 seems to be a “soft cap” on gearing for players who aren’t engaging in organized content (as well as the pieces you can get from the Vault, up to 616) — but you can still find a few higher pieces here and there, in addition to those sources of Crests to upgrade what you have.SUPERINTENDENT KALCHEUSQ4tQ Any NextFest demos catch your eye to try out?To quote Principal Skinner: “Yes!”Starting with the one you tipped me about a couple days ago, lol. Moon Watch!It’s described as a “Time-Control Deckbuilder,” and to me, it seems like “One Step From Eden meets Vampire Survivors” — two games that are totally my jam. I haven’t tried it just yet, but I’m excited about it.Another one is Rift of the NecroDancer, a brand-new game following on the footsteps of Crypt of the NecroDancer and Cadence of Hyrule. (In this house we stan Cadence!)

Bitcoin is up more than 9% over the past week and ether is up about 7%. Other popular coins have also rallied, with solana up close to 10% in the past seven days and dogecoin up 15%. The gains have made their way to crypto-pegged stocks. Digital asset exchange Coinbase climbed 7% on Wednesday, bringing its three-day rally to 19%. The stock is at its highest since August. Bitcoin miners Marathon Digital and Riot Platforms also moved higher on Wednesday. One reason for bitcoin's 53% gain so far this year is a host of new spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds that hit the market in January, welcoming in a host of new investors. Ether ETFs followed in July. Investors have bought $1.2 billion in ETF shares in the past three days, bringing total holdings to more than $63 billion. BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has accounted for more than 30% of the new purchases. Samara Cohen, chief investment officer of ETF and index investments at BlackRock, told CNBC recently that 80% of buyers of IBIT are direct investors. Of those, 75% have never owned a BlackRock ETF, she said. "We went into this journey with the expectation that we needed to educate ETF investors on crypto and on bitcoin specifically," Cohen said. "As it turns out, we have done a lot of education of crypto investors on the benefits of the ETP wrapper." WATCH: Trump's coin sale misses targets Got a confidential news tip?

ERIC KIM Microstrategy > Blackrock You understand thedifference between having $16bn forever that you can leverage versus having $22bn that people can withdraw tomorrow. Massive, large digital capital base . Invest what you are personally excited enthusiastic about! You want to be desirable, play hard to get which means … you don’t want anybody to take you. When the covenants become restrictive, pay it off. Maybe my new strategy is to try to finance, get capital or start up capital for friends and family, at a marginal interest rate like one percent, sell micro strategy stock or whatever, to pay off the debt obligations, or to just pay off the debt in about 3 to 5 years? For example, if you could secure $1 million of funding, at one percent, But the due date isn’t five years from now, this is a good idea. The playbook is out there, just follow it!

Title: 3 Ways Bitcoin Is Like Digital Real Estate

Time Published: 2024-10-16T16:00:00Z

MIAMI, FLORIDA - APRIL 7: Michael Saylor, Chairman & CEO, MicroStrategy, gestures as he speaks ... [+] during the Bitcoin 2022 Conference at Miami Beach Convention Center on April 7, 2022 in Miami, Florida. The worlds largest bitcoin conference runs from April 6-9, expecting over 30,000 people in attendance and over 7 million live stream viewers worldwide.(Photo by Marco Bello/Getty Images) For past generations, owning real estate was the average person’s golden opportunity to accrue generational wealth. But for Generation Z, there’s an entirely new touchstone that will separate the “haves and have-nots” in their retirement years: bitcoin. Here are 3 ways that bitcoin functions like digital real estate, and why it will likely eat away at its analog counterpart over time. Bitcoin is a global, uncensorable, neutral reserve asset with no counterparty risk. As long as there is demand in the world for safe value storage, there will be demand for bitcoin. Likewise, real estate will be in demand for as long as human beings need space to live and do business. Both bitcoin and real estate will always be in style with almost anyone in the world, making them ideal assets to accumulate with a low risk of long-term value collapse. “A Bitcoin is a city block in cyberspace,” said MicroStrategy founder Michael Saylor during an interview on the Funky Crypto podcast in 2020. “If I told you a billion people are coming to that city, and you own the right property, why don’t you keep it in the family for a hundred years?” Currencies can be printed, and stocks can be diluted through issuance. Consumer products like phones and cars can be reproduced to meet consumer demand. Real estate is a different story, however. While more buildings can technically be constructed, it is a difficult and slow process to build more homes, especially in high-demand city centers that are already densely populated like New York, London, and Tokyo. Due to factors like geography, climate, economic activity, and zoning laws, it grows more difficult to find locations to build homes and businesses that are actually desirable. Meanwhile, as the local population and currency supply rise in tandem, demand for land in these areas increases, driving up costs over time. Bitcoin is likely to experience similar price appreciation to real estate over time since the asset is also reliably scarce. With a hard-coded supply cap of just 21 million units, bitcoin has repeatedly proven to appreciate faster when US interest rates are low. Both real estate and Bitcoin make for excellent long-term stores of value, and powerful hedges against inflation. Bitcoin’s loudest critics have long contested that it lacks real value because it is a non-productive asset with no intrinsic yield. “Apartments are going to produce rental, and farms are going to produce food,” said Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffet at the Woodstock for Capitalists annual meeting in 2022. [Bitcoin] isn’t going to do anything.“ But this difference is changing fast. Earlier this year, the launch of bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds in the United States gave bitcoin access to the financial rails and tooling of other investment products. What’s more, BlackRock has now received approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission to list options for its bitcoin ETF. This will let bitcoin owners begin earning interest by selling call options to traders, turning bitcoin into an asset with cash flows. New technology is also boosting bitcoin’s productivity. Projects like Babylon are now working on bringing “staking” to bitcoin – a feature that lets you earn a yield on your BTC by locking it away to secure other blockchain networks. This feature is already available for cryptocurrencies like ethereum, where stakers currently earn 3.2% APR. Not only does bitcoin share the core properties of real estate that make it a superb store of value, but its digital nature radically improves those aspects. Real estate is landlocked by definition. Any particular piece of land is therefore at the total mercy of local regulations and tax laws, which can radically affect the value of a particular land investment over time. By contrast, bitcoin is a fully fungible and global asset. Efforts to heavily tax bitcoin ownership will likely drive wealthy bitcoin owners overseas to regions that will treat them and their digital possessions most kindly. Unlike real estate, bitcoin is also hyper-divisible – down to a fraction of a cent. This lets small buyers acquire bitcoin in small amounts and lets existing owners cash out of it in small pieces at their own discretion. Real estate, however, has a barrier to entry. Young people in metropolitan areas must burden themselves with a hefty down payment and tremendous debt to own a home and enter the market. Given bitcoin’s greater accessibility and superior returns to land over the past decade, it is no wonder why the asset is especially popular among young people. A survey from PolicyGenius in early April showed that 20% of Gen Z respondents in the U.S. owned crypto, versus just 5% of baby boomers. Compared to other investments, only 18% of Gen Z owned stocks, and 13% owned real estate. With digital currency now a mainstay financial instrument, the life formula for financial success is being rewritten. For boomers, it was to go to college. For Gen X and early millennials, it was to buy a home. For youth today, it might just be to HODL their bitcoin. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

Title: Akebia Therapeutics extends supply agreement with STA Pharmaceutical
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/company-news/akebia-therapeutics-extends-supply-agreement-with-sta-pharmaceutical-93CH-3666553
Time Published: 2024-10-16T15:35:20Z
Full Content:
Akebia Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:AKBA) has announced an extension of its supply agreement with STA Pharmaceutical Hong Kong Limited, as per the recent 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The amendment, signed on Tuesday, prolongs the duration of the original contract until January 1, 2032. The Cambridge, Massachusetts-based biopharmaceutical company initially entered into the agreement with STA on February 10, 2021, for the manufacturing of vadadustat, a drug product developed by Akebia. Vadadustat is an investigational treatment for anemia due to chronic kidney disease. Under the terms of the newly amended agreement, the companies have revised the volume-based pricing structure along with certain other provisions related to the product. These changes are expected to be detailed in the company's forthcoming Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ending September 30, 2024. The extension of this agreement signifies Akebia's ongoing commitment to the development and potential commercialization of vadadustat. The financial terms and specifics of the revised pricing structure have not been disclosed in the filing. However, the company plans to file a copy of the amendment as an exhibit to its upcoming quarterly report. This strategic move comes as part of Akebia's efforts to secure the long-term supply of vadadustat, which is currently under clinical investigation. The information disclosed is based on a press release statement. In other recent news, Akebia Therapeutics has made significant strides in the commercialization of its anemia drug, Vafseo. The Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services approved additional reimbursement for Vafseo to dialysis organizations, a move that is expected to support the adoption of the drug within these practices. Furthermore, Akebia has signed a substantial commercial supply agreement with U.S. Renal Care for Vafseo, which is set to be available in January 2025. Akebia has also initiated a clinical trial, known as the VOICE trial, in collaboration with U.S. Renal Care to evaluate Vafseo's effects on dialysis patients. In a strategic shift, Akebia ended its collaboration with CSL (OTC:CSLLY) Vifor and amended loan terms with Kreos Capital VII, managed by BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK), thus regaining full sales rights to Vafseo in the United States. H.C. Wainwright has reiterated a Buy rating for Akebia, reflecting confidence in the company's commercial strategy and the potential market penetration of Vafseo. Financially, Akebia reported an improvement in Q1 2024 revenues, totaling $32.6 million, despite a net loss of $18 million. The company remains well-capitalized with $42 million in cash and equivalents. As part of the executive team changes, Akebia appointed Erik Ostrowski as Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Business Officer, Treasurer, and Principal Financial (NASDAQ:PFG) Officer. To provide additional context to Akebia Therapeutics' (NASDAQ:AKBA) recent supply agreement extension, let's examine some key financial metrics and insights from InvestingPro. As of the latest data, Akebia's market capitalization stands at $275.48 million. The company's revenue for the last twelve months as of Q2 2024 was $174.5 million, with a revenue growth of -13.13% over the same period. This decline in revenue aligns with the company's focus on securing long-term partnerships, such as the extended agreement with STA Pharmaceutical Hong Kong Limited, which may help stabilize future revenue streams. InvestingPro Tips highlight that Akebia is not currently profitable, with a negative P/E ratio of -7.17 for the last twelve months as of Q2 2024. This underscores the importance of the company's efforts to optimize its supply chain and potentially reduce costs through volume-based pricing adjustments mentioned in the article. Despite the challenges, there are positive signals. An InvestingPro Tip notes that two analysts have revised their earnings upwards for the upcoming period, suggesting some optimism about Akebia's future performance. This could be related to the company's strategic moves, including the extended supply agreement for vadadustat. It's worth noting that InvestingPro offers 13 additional tips for Akebia Therapeutics, providing a more comprehensive analysis for investors interested in delving deeper into the company's prospects.

Title: Blanchardstown route is latest BusConnects corridor to be challenged in High Court
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2024/10/16/blanchardstown-route-is-latest-busconnects-corridor-to-be-challenged-in-high-court/
Time Published: 2024-10-16T11:44:38Z
Full Content:
The Blanchardstown to Dublin city centre route is the latest proposed BusConnects corridor to be the target of a High Court challenge. Two companies that own and operate an unmanned Go petrol station on the Old Cabra Road in Dublin 7 claim 94 per cent of their customers would be wiped out if the road changes proceed as proposed. Lissan Coal Company (Ireland) Limited and LCC Properties and Investments (Ireland) Limited say the plan includes installation of bus gates that will prevent through traffic (other than buses, taxis and cyclists) from proceeding along the Old Cabra Road. The companies, which have registered offices in Co Monaghan, say the removal of regular traffic will have a “catastrophic” effect on the commercial viability of their site. They are asking the court to cancel An Bord Pleanála’s decision of last June to approve the Blanchardstown bus corridor and a compulsory purchase order affecting its site and right of access. Their High Court challenge is the fourth concerning bus corridors approved as part of the capital’s flagship bus project. An Artane resident is pursuing a case over permission for the Clongriffin to city centre route, while two court actions have been brought by businesses over the Blackrock to city centre corridor. The National Transport Authority (NTA), which is charged with delivering BusConnects, has received planning permission for six of the 12 bus corridors. Lissan and LCC secured High Court permission this week to pursue their claims over the Blanchardstown proposal. Their senior counsel, Eamon Galligan, instructed by William Fry solicitors, told Mr Justice Richard Humphreys his clients’ business “is going to be completely wiped out”. He said Lissan and LCC are the only owner/occupiers to be affected to such an extent by the removal of a right of way for the route and their case raises “serious constitutional issues”. He said the proposal would lead to there being no access across the bus corridor to the Go filling station, yet there is no provision for compensating his clients. He said he will be seeking a pause to the effects of the approval of the scheme. Aoife Carroll, senior barrister for the NTA, said the challenge concerns an “important” public infrastructure project. She said no works are currently being carried out and the challengers’ lawyers should write to the NTA before seeking a pause of the permission. The case is brought against An Bord Pleanála, the NTA, Ireland and the Attorney General. Among the companies’ grounds of challenge is that the board allegedly acted beyond its powers in approving the project when there was no proposal to provide alternative access to the filling station. They allege it was “unreasonable and irrational” for the planning authority to conclude their business would be able to continue.

Time Published: 2024-10-16T07:00:21Z

Fink’s view that the utilization of assets will become increasingly significant worldwide. Bitcoin [BTC] has rebounded strongly, breaking back into bullish territory after dipping to the $60,000 mark. Trading at $65,796.33 at press time, the leading cryptocurrency has gained 1.40% in the last 24 hours and climbed 5.26% over the past week as per CoinMarketCap. Seeing this surge, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink highlighted Bitcoin’s increasing legitimacy as an investment asset, suggesting it’s becoming a viable alternative to traditional commodities like gold. Remarking on the same, during BlackRock’s Q3 2024 earnings call, Fink said, “We believe bitcoin is an asset class in itself.” Fink in his call also stressed less on concerns surrounding regulatory changes, asserting that increased acceptance and liquidity will be the primary catalysts for market expansion. He added, “I truly don’t believe it’s a function of regulation — of more regulation, less regulation. I think it’s a function of liquidity, transparency … no different than years ago when we started the mortgage market, years ago when the high-yield market occurred.” This success can be attributed to BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF, which, after a decade of persistent efforts, has finally received approval and has since attracted impressive inflows. He further highlighted how the successful launch of the iShares Ethereum Trust, which garnered over $1 billion in net inflows within its first two months of trading. Alongside the iShares Bitcoin Trust, BlackRock has reached $23 billion in inflows in just nine months. Echoing similar sentiments, analyst Ben Budish raised the question of how a more crypto-friendly administration in Washington might influence the market, suggesting potential regulatory changes could unlock further opportunities. However, Fink downplayed the impact of political changes, arguing that broader acceptance and legitimacy of digital assets will be the primary drivers of market growth, rather than regulatory adjustments. He said, “I do believe the utilization of assets are going to become more and more of a reality worldwide,” This perspective underscores BlackRock’s bullish outlook on cryptocurrencies and its strategic role in facilitating investment in this evolving landscape. That being said, Fink emphasized that these products reflect BlackRock’s overarching mission to simplify and reduce the costs of investing for a global audience. “We will continue to pioneer new products to be making investing easier and more affordable.” He proposed that similar to traditional markets, the digital asset landscape would grow with the advancement of enhanced analytics and data insights. “And I truly believe we will see a broadening of the market of these digital assets.” However, Bitcoin critic Peter Schiff voiced an alternative viewpoint when he said, Source: Peter Schiff/X Schiff argues that gold—particularly in its tokenized form—remains a superior alternative to Bitcoin. This perspective highlights the ongoing debate between the two assets, as investors weigh the merits of Bitcoin’s growth against gold’s enduring value.

Share this article US spot Bitcoin ETFs have seen a major surge in net purchases, totaling over $1 billion in the last three trading days, according to Farside Investors. Fidelity and BlackRock have been the standout performers, attracting approximately $760 million combined during the stretch. Flows returned in the green last Friday as the Bitcoin ETFs collectively drew in $253 million, ending their brief outflow streak that lasted three consecutive days. On Monday, these funds logged almost $556 million in net inflows, the highest level since early June. Yesterday alone, ETF net buying topped $371 million with no redemptions reported. BlackRock’s IBIT captured the largest share inflows, accumulating over $288 million, while Fidelity’s FBTC took in around $35 million. Other competing funds managed by Bitwise, Ark Invest/21Shares, VanEck, WisdomTree, and Grayscale, also experienced gains. Grayscale’s GBTC and BTC have extended their winning streak to two days. Inflows surged amid a rally in Bitcoin, with the price crossing $65,000 on Monday and moving closer to $68,000 yesterday, CoinGecko data shows. Bitcoin is now only 9% away from its all-time high. Standard Chartered analysts predict that Bitcoin could approach its previous high of approximately $73,800 ahead of the US presidential election. The analysts also note that the improving odds for Donald Trump’s re-election could create a favorable environment for Bitcoin, as historically, his presidency has been viewed positively by many in the crypto community.

Title: Establishment Journos Tout Migrants over Machine-Powered Americans
URL: https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2024/10/15/establishment-journos-tout-migrants-over-machine-powered-americans/
Time Published: 2024-10-16T00:42:26Z
Full Content:
Pro-migration journalists insist Americans need more migrants because of the declining U.S. birth rates — but they also deliberately ignore the alternative economy-growing strategy of combining automation, Americans, and exports. The growing claim that migrants are needed to replace Americans comes as polls show declining public support for the labor migration that has reduced wages, spiked housing, and imposed more chaotic diversity on Americans’ society. President Donald Trump’s running mate, JD Vance, spotlighted the flaw behind the claim that more migrants are needed for basic work in the United States, by telling a surprised New York Times journalist: One of the really deranged things that I think illegal immigration does to our society is it gets us in a mind-set of saying we can only build houses with illegal immigrants when we have [sidelined] seven million — just men, not even women, just men — who have completely dropped out of the labor force. People say, “Well, Americans won’t do those jobs.” [But] Americans won’t do those jobs for below-the-table wages. They won’t do those jobs for non-living wages … they will just do those jobs at certain wages. Think about the perspective of an American company. I want them to go searching in their own country for their own [sidelined] citizens, sometimes people who may be struggling with addiction or trauma, get them re-engaged in American society. We cannot have an entire American business community that is giving up on American workers and then importing millions of illegal laborers. The New York Times journalist — London-born, Cuban-origin Lulu Garcia-Navarro — was shocked and tried to refute Vance’s call for the federal government to help sidelined Americans get construction jobs that would otherwise go to migrants. I don’t think that many people who look into this agree with you. But about a third of the construction work force in this country is Hispanic. Of those, a large proportion are undocumented. So how do you propose to build all the housing necessary that we need in this country by removing all the people who are working in construction? But this journalist’s surprise at Vance’s preference for Americans reflects the conventional wisdom in elite D.C. circles, which insists that the economy can only be grown with more migrants — not by productive Americans and their high-tech machines. “People in the media announcing their complete detachment from society is not new,” responded Jon Feere at the Center for Immigration Studies. He continued: There’s no such thing as a job Americans won’t do, and when businesses can’t find a lawful resident to take a job, they have to consider raising wages, offering better benefits. That’s a good thing, [Reporters] don’t understand the ways the labor force can adjust. They don’t understand that mechanization can fill a lot of these jobs that they think requires stoop labor. When I hear people celebrating the ability to exploit cheap labor while attempting to project a pro-immigrant image, it’s one of the most gross, almost disgusting things I hear. They like the idea of creating a permanent underclass, they like the ability to exploit desperation. “Of course, most of these newsrooms are owned by corporations that have an interest in an endless amount of exploitable foreign labor, and most journalists don’t have the freedom to write something that goes against corporate demands,” he added. The Democrat Party’s leaders put migration before Americans. “We got the lowest birth rate we’ve had in well over 100 years,” Bill Clinton told a media audience on October 14. “We’re not at replacement level, which means we got to have somebody come here if we want to keep growing the economy.” “We have a population that is not reproducing on its own with the same level that it used to,” Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) told a D.C. audience in November 2022. “The only way we’re going to have a great future in America is if we welcome and embrace immigrants, the dreamers and all of them.” “We look to the north, with Canada,” Cuban-born border chief Alejandro Mayorkas said in September. “Canada takes a look at its market needs, and it says, “You know what? We need 700,000 foreign workers to address our labor needs domestically.” And so they build a visa system for that year to address the current market condition.” Mayorkas’s Canada-style, cheap labor policy is endorsed by Kamala Harris’s 2024 economic platform. These pro-migration economic claims are driven by the Democratic Party’s self-serving desire for a greater population of poor migrants and by their consumer-economy donors’ rational desire for government-provided extra workers, customers, and renters. However, the alternative strategy would ensure greater employment of sidelined Americans, greater workplace productivity via automation, and greater exports to foreign markets via mutual trade with countries that are now used as a source of cheap migrant labor. The productivity-before-population strategy was pushed in April by Larry Fink, the founder of the $10 trillion Blackrock investment company: “I can argue, in the developed countries, the big winners are the countries that have shrinking populations,” Fink said at a pro-globalist event hosted by the World Economic Forum in Saudi Arabia. He continued: That’s something that most people never talked about. We always used to think [a] shrinking population is a cause for negative [economic] growth. But in my conversations with the leadership of these large, developed countries [such as China, and Japan] that have xenophobic anti-immigration policies, they don’t allow anybody to come in — [so they have] shrinking demographics — these countries will rapidly develop robotics and AI and technology … If a promise of all that transforms productivity, which most of us think it will [emphasis added] — we’ll be able to elevate the standard living in countries, the standard of living for individuals, even with shrinking populations. In contrast, countries with expanding populations need to focus on basic issues of education and the “rule of law,” said Fink, adding: So for those countries that have rising populations, the answer will be education … [and] for those countries that do not have a foundation of rule of law, or education, that’s where the [economic] divide is going to get more and more extreme Vance focused his argument on helping sidelined Americans get back to work when Garcia-Navarro insisted that there were no additional Americans who can join the construction industry. “Most people who don’t work can’t work in the regular economy — they’re in the military, they’re parents, they’re sick, they’re old, they might not want to work in construction,” said Garcia-Navarro. “The unemployment rate does not count labor-force participation dropouts,” Vance schooled her. Since Congress doubled the immigration numbers in 1990, the share of “prime age” men in jobs has fallen from roughly 93 percent to 88 percent in 2023. The share of men without four-year college degrees who are working jobs has dropped from 91 percent to roughly 84 percent. Nationwide, the drop adds up to five million non-working men. The decline in the labor force participation rate among _prime-age_ (25-54) U.S.-born men is also most pronounced among the less-educated. Sources: Figures for 1960, 1970, 1980, and 1990 are from the public-use decennial census, which is collected in April. Figures for 2000, 2006, 2019, and 2023 are from the April public-use CPS. That pool of men is not being recruited by employers for a variety of reasons, chiefly, they are too troublesome and risky for employers to find, motivate, train, and keep. But employers do not have to train those men when Mayorkas is bringing in roughly 3 million legal, quasi-legal, illegal, or tempory foreign people per year. That Mayorkas migration adds roughly 3 migrants for every four Americans born each year. Since the pushback by Vance, pro-migration activists and journalists have kept up their demands pushing for more migration Without migrants, “I don’t think there would be milk,” Pete Wiersma, the president of the Idaho Dairymen’s Association, told a credulous columnist for the New York Times. But, writer Marcela Valdes admitted, “In the long run, more dairies might invest in robotic milkers if the price of milk rose high enough to justify the capital-intensive systems.” Breitbart News has extensively covered the spreading use of labor-saving cow-milking robots and other labor-saving machines in the agriculture and meatpacking sectors. So far, Democrats in Congress have not pushed for government loans to help farmers purchase more robots, but have instead tried to expand illegal farmwork into a pathway to citizenship. Illegals comprise perhaps 50 percent of the construction labor force in Texas, so “cutting off the supply of undocumented workers, then, would be like cutting off the supply of concrete and lumber,” claimed left-wing Jack Herrera at Texas Monthly. “Far fewer homes and businesses would be built in the next few decades,” he said as he quoted construction industry leaders who are lobbying for more cheap workers. However, the vast inflow of disposable migrant workers has pushed millions of American professionals and their young replacements out of the sector. “It’s not easy to find a good worker, a loyal worker, for [the] long term,” Val Fomin, general contractor at Katz Design & Builders Inc., told Capitalandmain.com in October 204. “It is challenging. It’s almost like full-time work.” So the construction industry has “stunningly bad productivity performance,” Barack Obama’s economic advisor Austan Goolsbee wrote in February 2023. He added: Throughout the 1950s and well into the 1960s, both measures of construction sector productivity grew steadily. Indeed, they outpaced their whole-economy counterparts during that period. By 1970, however, the construction sector’s labor productivity and TFP had both begun to fall. This downturn was not temporary; the decline has continued for the past half century …. [But by 2020] measures of construction productivity had fallen below their 1950 values. In Springfield, Ohio, employers welcome unskilled Haitian migrants into jobs that would otherwise go to fewer but better-paid Americans and their computer-controlled machines. “We were having a real hard time with [American] people that would apply for a job and then they wouldn’t show up on the floor,” Pentaflex CEO Ross McGregor told two CNN.com pro-migration reporters.“Or they’d come in and they’d work for half a day and they’d just leave … You need to have a reliable workforce that you can count on to be at work every day.” But hiring Haitians means fewer robots and their American operators. “Fewer robots get adopted in municipalities with a large share of migrant workers,” said a Danish study posted in December 2022. The study added: We find that a one percentage point increase in the share of non-Western migrants decreases the probability of robot adoption by 7% … Higher wages are positively associated with the value of robot imports.” In the white-collar sector, C-suite executives prefer hiring disposable, compliant, and cheap visa workers — such as H-1B workers — instead of sharing profits and power with free-speaking American professionals. Even when pro-migration journalists try to argue that migrants are good for American workers, they miss the importance of productivity and the Americans who have been pushed out of work. “The co-incidence of stagnating wages and rising immigration really does look like just that: a coincidence,” wrote author Rogé Karma in The Atlantic — without mentioning automation, productivity, or sidelined Americans. Yet the unpopular demotion of Americans and productivity by the establishment media is now helping President Donald Trump’s 2024 campaign. NBC News reported: about a young American construction worker who is slow to quit his parent’s house because of high rents: For David Tasker, an 18-year-old construction worker in Pennsylvania, his top financial priorities are having enough money for gas, dining out and spending on his girlfriend while living at home with his parents. But he worries about the rising prices he’s seen during his teen years as he’s emerged into an economy experiencing decades-high inflation. For his first election, he said he will be voting for former President Donald Trump with those higher costs and concerns about the wider economy in mind.

DTX Exchange (DTX) hit $4.7 million in its presale weeks earlier than expected. The presale’s resounding success proves the project’s wide interest. It offers a unified, multi-asset trading platform with access to cryptocurrencies, equities, and real-world assets (RWA). Despite the DeFi space getting the attention of giants like BlackRock and Morgan Stanley, the DTX exchange has made a mark in the space because of its unique offering. The platform bridges the gap between traditional and decentralized financial markets by allowing users to trade over 100,000 assets on a single platform. These financial giants have not been able to provide this unified system, which gives DTX Exchange an edge. Traders also enjoy low fees on the platform despite providing a variety of assets and making it easier to manage their portfolios. The diversity also allows traders access to deeper liquidity in the broader equities market with over $90 trillion worth of assets. The outstanding presale performance attests to the potential of DTX exchange, with considerable early participation in its three presale rounds. The first round raised approximately $300,000. Even better, the second phase exceeded $1 million in total funds raised, while the third presale round concluded ahead of schedule, raising over $4.75 million across all rounds. DTX exchange comes with some excellent features, which it owes to the early adoption it has witnessed. VulcanX Blockchain – This is a privacy blockchain that powers the DTX ecosystem, and is the first unified blockchain to support conventional financial assets. With a throughput of over 100,000, this blockchain is expected to power the next decentralized applications of the future. DTX Unified Wallet – The DTX Unified Wallet is the first crypto wallet to support forex, equities, and crypto assets under a single secure application. More features like P2P asset trading and portfolio management tools are expected in the near future. Enterprise RWA Platform – DTX is onboarding conventional assets on the blockchain, thanks to the Real World Assets (RWA) builder platform. DTX exchange plans to bring more amazing features and offerings to its ecosystem in the near future. The team intends to make the platform available for public trading after the launch of the VulcanX blockchain. With a community of 70,000 across platforms, the exchange hopes to gain wider accessibility, which will significantly increase its reach base upon public launch. New products are also under development to add more features and capabilities to the platform.

Title: BlackRock CEO Touts Bitcoin as an Alternative to Gold as BTC ETF Inflows Hit 4-Month High

BlackRock, a $10 trillion asset manager that is also one of the largest Bitcoin holders through its spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), is still betting big on BTC, as the firm’s CEO, Larry Fink, recently stated. While releasing the company’s third-quarter earnings results last week, Fink noted that Bitcoin (BTC) was in its own asset class. He also likened Bitcoin to other financial commodities, adding that it was an alternative to gold. “We believe Bitcoin is an asset class in itself. It is an alternative to other commodities like gold. And so, I think the application of this form of investment will be expanded to the role of Ethereum as a blockchain,” he stated. Fink also believes that the digital asset industry could achieve the same growth as the mortgage market. According to him, the mortgage industry started very slow during its early years before becoming an $11 trillion industry. The same growth could also happen in the cryptocurrency industry. Fink’s recent statements coincided with a bullish sentiment around Bitcoin as the price shot up to a one-month high above $66,000. BTC traded at $65,700 at the time of writing after a 1.8% gain in 24 hours. Bitcoin’s recent price gains coincided with a surge in spot ETF inflows. Data from SoSoValue shows that on 14th October, inflows to spot Bitcoin ETFs reached $555M, the highest level since early June. Fidelity saw the highest inflows, at $239M. It was followed by the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF, which saw $100M in inflows. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust saw $79M inflows, while the Ark & 21Shares ETF recorded $69M. The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust also saw positive flows of $37M. These spot Bitcoin ETFs currently hold $61 billion worth of Bitcoin, nearly 5% of the total Bitcoin market capitalization. On-chain analytics platform Santiment has attributed the recent gains in Bitcoin prices to an influx in short liquidations. In its recent report, Santiment noted that earlier this week, total short liquidations for Bitcoin reached $100M. Data from Coinglass shows that in the last 24 hours, more than $53M worth of Bitcoin positions were liquidated, with over 85% of these being short liquidations. Additionally, the start of the week saw a slight increase in USDT deposits to exchanges. A spike in stablecoin inflows to exchanges also tends to spur gains by creating additional buying pressure.

NEXT | Celebrate the launch of Diablo 4 Vessel of Hatred with week two of ... With the World of Warcraft 20th Anniversary Event right around the corner (starting October 22) we’ve now learned how to earn Bronze Celebration Tokens during the event so that we can earn the currency to purchase all of the new shiny things that are up for offer. So the question today is: how exactly do we purchase these new revamped Tier 2 sets? What are the costs? Thankfully, Blizzard made a post to address many of these things so today we’ll break down the “what you need to know” if you’re just after the Tier 2 sets. Outside of the Caverns of Time you will find a Tauren vendor named Traeya who will be your Tier 2 armor vendor. Here’s what we now know about pricing: With this in mind, you will need exactly 320 Bronze Celebration Tokens if the only thing you are after are the revamped Tier 2 armor sets. Now, if you’re collecting all the sets, you may also want to do some Timewalking during the event, as one of the new Timewalking weapon appearances is the Claymore of the Knight’s Pledge, a 2-Hand sword that is modeled off the Judgement Tier 2 armor. While we’ve written up an entire guide on how to earn Bronze Celebration Tokens, it should be noted that once you’ve earned your first two Tier 2 armor sets that you’ll earn a warband account unlock that allows you to get ungated tokens from the following events: We aren’t entirely sure how many you can get per event, but that might be an easier way to earn your additional 220 Bronze Celebration Tokens in case you really prefer to run Timewalking nonstop (or really, really love Korrak’s Revenge). Is there a set that you’re specifically chasing after, Watchers? Judgement (Paladin), Pale Rider (Death Knight), Battlegear of the August (Monk), and Netherwalker (Demon Hunter) are all on my “must have” list, but what about you?

Title: Crypto Comeback: Bitcoin ETFs Attract $556 Million In Fresh Inflows

Time Published: 2024-10-15T17:00:18Z

Spot Bitcoin US exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are roaring today, recording the highest inflow in four months as a total sum of $556 million streamed into 12 funds. Coincidentally, by the time the inflow was received, Bitcoin was rebounding as it touched a two-week high at $66,500. The highest single-day flow, at $239 million, came in through Farside (FBTC), the highest since June. Others performing well include Bitwise (BITB) at $100 million and BlackRock (IBIT) which managed to attract new investors to the rake in $79.51 million. Several funds posted inflows as the market continued to rally. The shares of ARK Invest and 21Shares (ARKB) stood at nearly $70 million, while Grayscale (GBTC), the bitcoin trust, recorded its first inflow since September at a little over $37 million even if the trust struggled with massive cumulative outflows of $20 billion since its inception. Other small funds that posted inflows included: HODL, EZBC, BTCO, Grayscale BTC Mini Trust, and Valkyrie whose inflows totaled over $29 million. Their growing action also pushed the trading volumes of these 12 Bitcoin ETFs up to $2.61 billion. Analysts project that this new rise will push such funds further by using the net inflows achieved in the past 10 months which is currently at $19.36 billion. This could also be due to Bitcoin ETFs also taking more than gold-based products, reaping $1.5 billion in net inflows this year. Bitcoin ETFs rose to the highest degree as compared to Ethereum ETFs, which responded relatively better. Net inflows into Ethereum ETFs stood at $17 million led by BlackRock (ETHA) with $14 million. Other funds in Fidelity (FETH), Invesco (QETH), and 21Shares (CETH) received flows ranging from $393,690 to $1.30 million. Trading volumes for Ethereum ETFs also rose to $210 million from $143.54 million the previous day. In fact, since their launch in July, Ethereum ETFs have seen net outflows of $542 million. The total cryptocurrency market also started to recover from its losses with Bitcoin trading at $65,268. Meanwhile, Ethereum increased by almost 3% to hit the $2,594 level by the end of the day. As Nate Geraci, President of ETF Store, said, this day was a “monster day” for spot Bitcoin ETFs, as the crypto investment product continues to gain mass appeal ahead of traditional and safer assets, such as gold.

Title: DTX Exchange’s Revolutionary Multi-Asset Platform Drives $4.75M Presale

New York, New York, October 15th, 2024, Chainwire With the cryptocurrency market entering the final quarter of the year with major bullish momentum, the emerging altcoin platform DTX Exchange (DTX) has made a strong impact. The DeFi platform has raised over $4.75 Million weeks earlier than expected. This early success reflects the growing interest in platforms that offer access to a diverse range of assets, including cryptocurrencies, equities, and real-world assets (RWA), under a unified trading system. Despite the entry of financial giants like Blackrock and Morgan Stanley into the decentralized world, there is still a lack of a unified platform that integrates conventional assets like equities, stocks, and bonds with decentralized assets like cryptocurrencies. DTX Exchange has aimed to bridge the gap between traditional and decentralized financial markets by allowing users to trade over 100,000 assets on a single platform. This innovative solution makes it possible for traders to access a wide variety of assets under a single platform with minimal trading fees. The global cryptocurrency industry is worth $2 trillion alone, with the broader equities market having over $90 trillion worth of assets. By enabling the trading of these assets, DTX provides traders with the chance to enhance liquidity. The DTX team aims to attract the attention of millions of retail and enterprise traders through this unique feature. DTX Exchange’s presale has seen considerable early participation across its initial rounds. The first round raised approximately $300,000 in a short period, while the second phase exceeded $1 million in total funds raised. The third presale round concluded ahead of schedule, with the platform raising over $4.75 million across all rounds to date. During this time, the token price increased from $0.01 to $0.08, reflecting initial interest in the platform’s offerings. DTX Exchange credits its early adoption to its unique product offerings, including: VulcanX Blockchain – This privacy blockchain powers the DTX ecosystem and is the first unified blockchain to support conventional financial assets. With a throughput of over 100,000, this blockchain is expected to power the next decentralized applications of the future. DTX Unified Wallet – The DTX Unified Wallet is the first crypto wallet to support forex, equities, and crypto assets under a single secure application. The product is expected to add features like P2P asset trading and portfolio management tools. Enterprise RWA Platform – DTX is onboarding conventional assets on the blockchain through the Real World Assets (RWA) builder platform. In the most recent development, the ongoing presale has sold over 50 million tokens and raised $3 million to sell out the 3rd round weeks ahead of schedule. The DTX team is now raising the token price, giving investors another opportunity to join the presale and secure DTX tokens before they launch on public exchanges. DTX Exchange has outlined its plans to make DTX tokens available for open public trading following the launch of the VulcanX blockchain. With a growing community of over 70,000 members, the platform is preparing for broader accessibility, which may help increase its reach and user base significantly upon public launch. Additionally, DTX also has an active developer community that is actively developing new products. Aside from offering a suite of trading features, DTX Exchange is expected to offer a wide range of products to developers and enterprise players in the finance world. Some notable products include the Real World Asset (RWA) tokenization tool that allows stakeholders in the Real Estate industry to tokenize assets and introduce new models of investment in illiquid assets. Additionally, DTX is expected to launch the DTX Unified Wallet, which allows holding stocks, cryptos, and forex assets. Additionally, future plans include holding the Digi-Hackathon to improve platform security and integrity. With the unique approach DTX Exchange has taken to unifying digital assets, its presale performance comes as no surprise. Built on the VulcanX blockchain, the platform is designed to improve transaction capacity compared to many layer-1 blockchains. Given the rapid pace of the presale sold, the altcoin could mirror the past trajectory of other cryptos that had exponential rallies. In the past, projects like Solana, Cardano, Polygon, and Dogecoin have all surged from small-scale altcoins into multi-billion dollar projects that have become household names. DTX Exchange aims to fulfill its potential and turn into a major powerhouse in the coming months. Investors can still become an early part of the DTX Exchange community. With a current price of $0.08 and a listing price of $0.20, investors are poised to enjoy growth in value in the coming months. With broad applications for the financial sector, DTX aims to become the cornerstone of the DeFi industry and carve out a sizeable portion of the $2 Trillion trading industry.

Title: Why Hyundai picked India for record $3.3 billion IPO
URL: https://www.dw.com/en/why-hyundai-picked-india-for-record-33-billion-ipo/a-70499104
Time Published: 2024-10-15T14:42:00Z
Full Content:
India is the world's third-largest auto market, set for further huge growth before the end of the decade. Hyundai is banking on the $3.3 billion IPO to solidify its market position. The South Korean auto giant Hyundai launched its initial public offering (IPO) on Tuesday, billed as India's biggest stock market debut, worth about $3.3 billion (€3.05 billion). The first carmaker to go public in India since Maruti Suzuki in 2003, Hyundai is offering 142 million shares for sale, which represents about 17.5% of the total shares of its Indian arm. Retail bidding, priced at 1,865 rupees ($22.20/€20.35) to 1,960 rupees per share, is expected to continue until Thursday. The stock market listing is expected to begin on October 22. Already India's second-largest carmaker by sales, Hyundai is keen to build on the advantage gained by its early entry into the national market in 1996. Last year, Hyundai sold over 605,000 vehicles in India, a 9% increase from the previous year. It hopes the additional funds will help close the market share gap with leader Maruti Suzuki. India already has the third-largest auto sector in the world — and it is growing fast. Last year, more than 4.1 million vehicles were sold. The auto sector is a major pillar of the economy and the country's large, growing consumer base and urbanization rate, along with relatively low production costs, make it an ideal location for Hyundai to manufacture and sell its vehicles. India's government is keen to boost domestic electric vehicle production, which aligns with the Korean carmaker's strategy. Hyundai also sees India as a critical alternative to China and Russia, where sales have dropped because of geopolitical issues. The South Asian country offers a more stable environment to its peers. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Globally, Hyundai's IPO will be the second largest this year in terms of money raised, following July's listing by Lineage Logistics, the world's largest cold-storage firm, worth $5.1 billion. Hyundai's listing will eclipse the 2022 IPO of the state-run Life Insurance Corporation of India, in which the government sold a 3.5% stake and raised $2.7 billion. Other top domestic listings in recent years include fintech giant Paytm, whose IPO was worth $2.2 billion in November 2021, and Coal India, which went public in 2010 at a value of $1.8 billion. India's stock market has been booming over the past four years, growing by 210% between April 2020 — during the first pandemic lockdown — and last month. On Tuesday, the SENSEX, the index of the Top 30 stocks on the Bombay Stock Exchange, was trading at 81,820. India recently pipped Hong Kong to become the fourth-largest stock market in the world. In a sign of the popularity of Hyundai's listing, nearly $1 billion in shares were snapped up by institutional investors on Monday. The government of Singapore and BlackRock, the giant US investment firm, picked up stakes worth a total of $77.3 million, while Fidelity bought shares worth $76.5 million and domestic mutual funds were allocated shares worth a total of $340 million. Retail investors snapped up 18% of the available shares by the end of Tuesday, the first day of the public offer, media reported. India's auto market has rapidly become ultracompetitive, and smaller domestic rivals Tata Motors and Mahindra & Mahindra have eaten into Hyundai's market share. "India is one of the most exciting auto markets in the world," Unsoo Kim, managing director of Hyundai's Indian unit, told a news briefing in Mumbai last week. "[The] IPO will ensure that Hyundai Motor India is even more dedicated to succeed in India." Hyundai plans to use proceeds from the IPO to enhance its research efforts and develop new cars, seeking to transform the country into a production hub for other countries in the Global South. Hyundai already delivers its India-made vehicles to more than 90 countries. "We intend to become a global manufacturing hub for Hyundai for the emerging markets," Tarun Garg, chief operating officer of Hyundai India, told the Reuters news agency. "In [the] next 3-4 years, [a] 30% increase in production will improve our domestic and export volumes." The Korean automaker has already invested $5 billion in the country and plans to pump in another $4 billion over the next decade to help make its Indian operations a key plank of its electric vehicle (EV) production, as well as building EV infrastructure such as charging stations and a battery assembly plant. Hyundai currently has one manufacturing plant in India for local sales and exports. Production at a second plant is expected to begin operations in 2025, which will help take the firm's total capacity in India to beyond 1 million units a year. Edited by: Rob Mudge

Title: Bitcoin inches toward $68,000 following BlackRock’s CEO crypto endorsement
URL: https://cryptobriefing.com/bitcoin-election-surge-analysis/
Time Published: 2024-10-15T14:41:42Z
Full Content:
Share this article Bitcoin hit a high of $67,800 in the last few minutes, moving closer to $68,000 and just 8% away from its March record high. The surge came after BlackRock CEO Larry Fink endorsed Bitcoin as a viable asset class. Fink recently reaffirmed his support for Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class during the company’s third-quarter earnings call. According to him, Bitcoin is not only a viable investment but also a rival to traditional commodities like gold. “We believe Bitcoin is an asset class in itself,” said BlackRock CEO, adding that the company was discussing potential Bitcoin allocations with institutions worldwide. As of now, Bitcoin’s market cap has reached $1.3 trillion, a figure that proves its growing prominence and acceptance in financial circles, per CoinGecko. BTC is currently trading at around $67,400, reflecting a 3% increase over the past 24 hours. The upward trend follows a notable 5% gain yesterday, which came amid the strong performance of US spot Bitcoin ETFs. On Monday, these funds collectively drew in around $550 million in net inflows, Farside Investors data shows. Market sentiment remains bullish with expectations of further increases if Trump secures a victory in the upcoming election. Concurrently, the recent rally comes amid the WLFI token presale of Trump-backed World Liberty Finance. The project raised $5 million in the first hour despite website issues. Analysts suggest Trump’s involvement could boost the crypto sector, contrasting with Kamala Harris’s more conservative stance on digital assets. The extended rally occurred around the time World Liberty Finance, the DeFi project backed by Trump, launched its WLFI token presale. The project raised $5 million in the first hour despite website issues. Market sentiment remains bullish with expectations of further increases if Donald Trump secures a victory in the upcoming election. Share this article Sign in to your account Don’t have an account?

Bank stocks surged Tuesday as several major financial institutions reported earnings, as the group gets a boost from lower interest rates. Charles Schwab led a financials rally Tuesday. Five of the eight largest U.S. banks by market capitalization reported third-quarter results Tuesday – Bank of America, Charles Schwab, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs – with the most notable metrics including 18% or better annual revenue jumps from Bank of America, Citi and Goldman’s equities trading divisions and shrinking debt from Schwab. The investor response was overwhelmingly positive to the batch of earnings, with Bank of America shares gaining 3% at open, Citi rising 1.7%, Schwab shares soaring 7% (on pace for its best day since July 2023), Goldman 3% and PNC 1%, though Citi and Goldman turned negative as trading continued. National banks Goldman and Morgan Stanley tallied all-time high intraday share prices Tuesday and a host of regional stocks like Bank of New York Mellon, PNC, U.S. Bancorp stocks registered 52-week highs, while other financial services firms like American Express and BlackRock also touched records. The S&P 500’s financials sector rose 0.8%, the third-largest gain of any of the index’s 13 sectors, while the BlackRock-managed iShares U.S. Financials exchange-traded fund also gained 0.8%, notching an all-time high. The iShares financials ETF is up 4% since last Thursday, as the U.S.’ largest and third-largest banks JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo reported bumper earnings Friday. It’s not just strong Q3 results driving the bank stock rally, but rather a “macro rotation,” noted Deutsche Bank analyst Matt O’Connor in a Friday note to clients. O’Connor added the market’s increased confidence that the U.S. avoided a recession is the “best outcome for banks.” That’s because investment banks get major boosts from better economic sentiment and declining rates as companies pursue mergers and acquisitions, initial public offerings, and other financing routes that require financial advisory services. The Federal Reserve cut interest rates last month for the first time in more than four years, and is widely expected to continue lowering rates. Last year was the weakest for M&A globally since 2013, according to McKinsey & Company. Though it’s been a strong stretch for national banks, many regional bank stocks have struggled to return to glory after 2023 marked the worst year for bank failures in U.S. history as regional powerhouses First Republic, Signature and Silicon Valley Banks went under in a seven-week stretch. The SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF is down more than 20% since the end of 2021. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

Title: DTX Exchange’s Revolutionary Multi-Asset Platform Drives $4.75M Presale

New York, New York, October 15th, 2024, Chainwire With the cryptocurrency market entering the final quarter of the year with major bullish momentum, the emerging altcoin platform DTX Exchange (DTX) has made a strong impact. The DeFi platform has raised over $4.75 Million weeks earlier than expected. This early success reflects growing interest in platforms that offer access to a diverse range of assets, including cryptocurrencies, equities, and real-world assets (RWA), under a unified trading system. Despite the entry of financial giants like Blackrock and Morgan Stanley into the decentralized world, there is still a lack of a unified platform that integrates conventional assets like equities, stocks, and bonds with decentralized assets like cryptocurrencies. DTX Exchange has aimed to bridge the gap between traditional and decentralized financial markets by allowing users to trade over 100,000 assets on a single platform. This innovative solution makes it possible for traders to access a wide variety of assets under a single platform with minimal trading fees. The global cryptocurrency industry is worth $2 trillion alone, with the broader equities market having over $90 trillion worth of assets. By enabling the trading of these assets, DTX provides traders with the chance to enhance liquidity. The DTX team aims to attract the attention of millions of retail and enterprise traders through this unique feature. DTX Exchange’s presale has seen considerable early participation across its initial rounds. The first round raised approximately $300,000 in a short period, while the second phase exceeded $1 million in total funds raised. The third presale round concluded ahead of schedule, with the platform raising over $4.75 million across all rounds to date. During this time, the token price increased from $0.01 to $0.08, reflecting initial interest in the platform’s offerings. DTX Exchange credits its early adoption to its unique product offerings, including: VulcanX Blockchain – This privacy blockchain powers the DTX ecosystem and is the first unified blockchain to support conventional financial assets. With a throughput of over 100,000, this blockchain is expected to power the next decentralized applications of the future. DTX Unified Wallet – The DTX Unified Wallet is the first crypto wallet to support forex, equities, and crypto assets under a single secure application. The product is expected to add features like P2P asset trading and portfolio management tools. Enterprise RWA Platform – DTX is onboarding conventional assets on the blockchain through the Real World Assets (RWA) builder platform. In the most recent development, the ongoing presale has sold over 50 million tokens and raised $3 million to sell out the 3rd round weeks ahead of schedule. The DTX team is now raising the token price, giving investors another opportunity to join the presale and secure DTX tokens before they launch on public exchanges. DTX Exchange has outlined its plans to make DTX tokens available for open public trading following the launch of the VulcanX blockchain. With a growing community of over 70,000 members, the platform is preparing for broader accessibility, which may help increase its reach and user base significantly upon public launch. Additionally, DTX also has an active developer community that is actively developing new products. Aside from offering a suite of trading features, DTX Exchange is expected to offer a wide range of products to developers and enterprise players in the finance world. Some notable products include the Real World Asset (RWA) tokenization tool that allows stakeholders in the Real Estate industry to tokenize assets and introduce new models of investment in illiquid assets. Additionally, DTX is expected to launch the DTX Unified Wallet, which allows holding stocks, cryptos, and forex assets. Additionally, future plans include holding the Digi-Hackathon to improve platform security and integrity. With the unique approach DTX Exchange has taken to unifying digital assets, its presale performance comes as no surprise. Built on the VulcanX blockchain, the platform is designed to improve transaction capacity compared to many layer-1 blockchains. Given the rapid pace of the presale sold, the altcoin could mirror the past trajectory of other cryptos that had exponential rallies. In the past, projects like Solana, Cardano, Polygon, and Dogecoin have all surged from small-scale altcoins into multi-billion dollar projects that have become household names. DTX Exchange aims to fulfill its potential and turn into a major powerhouse in the coming months. Investors can still become an early part of the DTX Exchange community. With a current price of $0.08 and a listing price of $0.20, investors are poised to enjoy growth in value in the coming months. With broad applications for the financial sector, DTX aims to become the cornerstone of the DeFi industry and carve out a sizeable portion of the $2 Trillion trading industry.
