The personality traits associated with collectors of art and antiques have been explored recently in various periodicals, including the Journal of Antiques and Collectibles. In an article for that specialist publication, US author and collector of Chinese porcelain Shirley M Mueller suggests the personal characteristics most associated with collectors include openness to experience and conscientiousness. She links “openness to experience” to those collectors who also have a broad range of interests, a curiosity and a deep appreciation for aesthetics. Musing on the psychology of the collector makes one wonder who might purchase an Edwardian silver tea service originally gifted to Sir Ernest Shackleton, the Co Kildare-born Antarctic explorer. The three-piece set, comprising a teapot, sugar bowl and milk jug, is for sale at Roseberys’ silver auction in London on September 30th, with an estimate of £2,000-£3,000 (€2,310-€3,470). Georgina Agnew, head of silver at Roseberrys, explains that the tea set was reputedly presented to Shackleton in New York in 1910 during his North American lecture tour. “It is engraved with the Shackleton family crest and motto ‘fortitudine vincimus’ meaning through endurance, we conquer,” she explains. The James Dixon & Sons of Sheffield tea set was passed to Ernest and Emily Shackleton’s daughter Cecily, before being given to her cousin and close friend, Rena Dodds. Dodds subsequently gifted the tea service to the current vendor’s mother. From 2001 until earlier this year, the tea set was on long-term loan to the Scott Polar Research Institute in Cambridge. But, who will buy it now? [ Listen: Ernest Shackleton’s adventure is told in his own voice - thanks to AIOpens in new window ] “As with all historically significant objects, we alert relevant museums, institutions and individuals ahead of the auction. Ernest Shackleton’s story is a global phenomenon, and while it could find a home anywhere in the world, it would be wonderful if an Irish institution were to acquire this important piece of history, given his Irish heritage,” Agnew says. Efforts by this columnist to contact the Shackleton Experience Museum in Athy, Co Kildare, were unsuccessful. A fascination for the belongings of owners of castles and stately homes will always attract potential buyers to auctions. So, Aidan Foley’s auction next week of almost 1,000 items from Castle Matrix, the former home of retired US air force pilot Colonel John O’Driscoll should draw some interest. O’Driscoll was aide to General Douglas MacArthur when he accepted the Japanese surrender in 1945. On his retirement in 1961, O’Driscoll bought and restored the dilapidated manor house near Rathkeale, Co Limerick. Originally built in the 15th century as a tower house for the Fitzgeralds, Earls of Desmond, Castle Matrix was later converted to a manor house by the Southwell family. It had been owned by the Johnstone family before O’Driscoll purchased it and opened it up for medieval-style banquets in the 1970s. Castle Matrix also served as headquarters of the International Institute of Military History and the Heraldry Society of Ireland. It remained open for tours until O’Driscoll’s death in 1991. As well as a large collection of historic books, there are more than 50 antique guns from Castle Matrix in the Foley auction. These guns, which the Garda took into storage at Collins Barracks in Cork following O’Driscoll’s death, are being sold in association with Pat Hayes, a registered firearms dealer, who must ensure any purchaser has acquired a gun licence before collecting their purchase. “It has been a difficult process to get the guns to auction, but they will be made available by Pat Hayes for viewing in Doneraile,” says Aidan Foley. Viewing for all lots continues today, tomorrow and Monday in Aidan Foley’s auction rooms in Doneraile, Co Cork. Restorers of historic houses may be interested in viewing the six 18th and 19th century fireplaces, alongside fenders and fire surrounds, at Hegarty’s live online auction on Wednesday, September 24th from 11am. The fireplaces, which include an Italian marble mantel with painted tiles and an embossed Adams-style motif from the Metropole Hotel in Cork (€6,000-€8,000), originated in Noble Antiques, a renowned specialist in antique fireplaces in Cork city, which is now closing down. An early 18th century simple framed Queen Anne-style marble fireplace is another item of potential interest (€5,000-€7,000). Finally, amid jewellery, gold and silver coins and silver bullion at Matthews’ live online auction on Tuesday, September 23rd from 5.30pm, are some quirky silver pieces. Perfect for gifts, these include a silver mustard pot with a blue glass lining (€30-€50); a silver-cased aide-memoire notebook pendant (€40-€70); and a silver pen rest with an intricate filigree domed lid (€150-€250).

Title: Oil Majors Rethink Green Projects Amid Anti-ESG Push

More Info Back in 2021, Texas passed two laws that restricted the state from doing business with companies deemed hostile to the fossil fuels and firearm industries. The Lone Star State barred pensions and other state entities from investing in approximately 350 funds that promote environmental, social and governance, aka ESG investing, claiming that ESG investing does not act in the best financial interests of their clients. To wit, the Republican-leaning state banned Wall Street giants Citigroup Inc., BlackRock Inc., Barclays Plc and members of Net Zero Banking Alliance, saying ESG is “…just a hate factory.” The anti-ESG movement has since gained traction, mostly targeting financial services like banks, pension funds and asset managers, as well as the energy sector. And now a new report by GlobalData reveals how the U.S. has become the epicenter of a rising tide of anti-ESG sentiment across the globe. The report points to a Pleiades Strategy tracker that reveals that a total of 370 anti-ESG bills were submitted to the legislatures of 40 U.S. states between 2021 and 2024. GlobalData notes that, whereas few of those bills were signed into law, this does not signify that the anti-ESG movement has weakened. Indeed, an analysis by Ropes & Gray found that anti-ESG bills filed in 2024 enjoyed a significantly higher rate of success than those filed in prior years, indicating that the architects of these bills are becoming more effective at drafting legislative challenges. Not surprisingly, the anti-ESG movement has gained massive momentum since the re-election of Donald Trump as U.S. President. Trump has rolled back many climate action policies by the previous administration, taken aim at DEI policies and passed executive orders banning ESG investing. Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill (OBBBA) has rolled back many clean energy credits enacted by former President Joe Biden under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022. Whereas OBBBA did not outright cancel the Section 45V clean hydrogen production tax credits as earlier feared, it did accelerate the deadline for projects to begin construction to be eligible for the credit, bringing the deadline forward to December 31, 2027, from January 1, 2033, as originally envisioned in Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022. Trump’s anti-climate actions are similar to his stance in his first term when he unraveled more than 100 climate policies. There are estimates that nearly $28 billion-worth of wind, solar, EV and battery projects have been delayed or cancelled since Trump took office, with a potential 19,000 jobs chopped. “Since President Trump’s re-election in November 2024, the efforts of the anti-ESG movement have ratcheted up, and all companies (not just those in the financial services industry) lie within the movement’s scope,” the GlobalData report states. “Trump has unravelled much of the previous administration’s climate action policies, passed executive orders banning ESG investing and taken aim at DEI policies.” Meanwhile, efforts by the European Union to simplify its regulatory landscape have frequently seen the bloc slide towards anti-ESG, with growing right-wing populism bolstering climate skepticism across the globe. International markets have opposed advancing ESG standards through initiatives like the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) and European Green Deal that enforce sustainability criteria by requiring disclosure of ESG-related risks. GlobalData has predicted that the anti-ESG movement will ultimately impact companies across all industries, including institutions and other entities previously considered to be fully independent. Not surprisingly, Big Oil companies have been scaling back their clean energy investments. Last year, oil and gas giant Exxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE:XOM) announced that it will not move forward with one of the world's largest low-carbon hydrogen projects if the federal government failed to provide tax incentives for natural gas-fed facilities. Current guidelines provide incentives for projects that produce "green" hydrogen by using water and renewable energy, but Exxon wants them extended to"blue" hydrogen from gas by trapping carbon emissions. That’s an interesting take because Exxon CEO Darren Woods previously expressed his doubts about the efficacy of carbon capture at lowering emissions because “…the technology works for high concentration streams of gases but is too expensive for low concentration streams.” BP Inc. (NYSE:BP) has unveiled a less aggressive decarbonization strategy that entails (1) a slower decline in upstream investments and scrapped former plans to shrink refining; (2) focus more on higher-margin hydrogen and biofuels as well as offshore wind; and (3) higher spending in both oil and gas as well as low-carbon. According to the company, the new strategy will offer higher shareholder returns, especially critical to the company after it severed ties with Russia’s Rosneft. BP’s nearly 20% stake in Rosneft helped to add several billion dollars to its bottom line every year. Back in April, BP announced that it was abandoning its hydrogen ambitions in favor of liquefied natural gas (LNG) for transport. Then in July, the European oil major announced that it would exit the $36-billion green hydrogen production facility planned in Australia. BP has informed its Australian Renewable Energy Hub (AREH) partners that it will leave its role as the project’s operator and equity holder. Shell Plc. (NYSE:SHEL) has revealed it had scrapped plans to build a low-carbon hydrogen plant in Norway citing lack of demand. Days later, Norway’s NOC Equinor ASA (NYSE:EQNR) announced similar plans, "We haven't seen the market for blue hydrogen materialize and decided not to progress the project," a Shell spokesperson told Reuters.

Title: Over 100 venues across Cork open for Culture Night
URL: https://www.rte.ie/news/ireland/2025/0919/1534378-over-100-venues-across-cork-open-for-culture-night/

Paschal Sheehy Southern Editor More than 100 venues across Cork will open tonight as part of Culture Night events in the city. They will include music and dance, literature and visual arts. Many of the events are concentrated in the city centre, with activities also in Blackpool, Togher, Churchfield and Mayfield. Online, Cork International Film Festival will present a selection of short films. Events are presented by Cork City Council in collaboration with the Arts Council. Some events require pre-booking, and details of all events taking place in the city are available at the Cork City Council website. Cian Sweeney presents 'As If I Always Knew: A Piano Meditation' in the Cork City Hall's concert hall; a variety of choirs will entertain on the City Hall plaza; a multi-panel art piece from Mahon Community Arts Project will be on display in the atrium; and the Millennium Hall will see a fun show called 'Squish, Stomp, Spin - The Magic of Stim', by performance artist and neurodiversity activist, Moss Russell. "It's my favourite night of the year," Moss Russell told RTÉ News as she looked ahead to Culture Night. "I love being part of it, I love performing in it, but I really miss running around and watching all the amazing things that are happening - just hopping from place to place, getting all of this free culture. It's absolutely one of the best nights of the year." Rappers and musicians from the Kabin Krew studio will celebrate the release of their new album, 'Up The Kabin', when they deliver a pop-up performance on Corn Market Street at 8pm. Kabin Krew Rapper Aaron Hennessy -- who earlier this year recorded with RTÉ's Bryan Dobson - is a big fan of Culture Night. "It's brilliant, yeah," Aaron said. "We've loads of opportunities and loads of decent stuff going on tonight." Cork City Library will host exhibitions, live music, theatre, readings, children's storytelling and creative workshops. Among the highlights will be the Rory Gallagher-inspired 'Kickback City' exhibition, an adaptation Coleridge’s 'The Rime of the Ancient Mariner' and music from Áine O’Gorman. There will be Irish language activities, in association with An t-Oireachtas, including award-winning sean-nós singer Sorcha de Róiste who will present a unique workshop celebrating traditional Irish song and 'Amhráin na Mara' (Songs of the Sea), a celebration of maritime songs in both Irish and English. MTU buildings across the city will open their doors too. Centre piece will be a multi-venue exhibition of works by MTU Crawford College of Art and Design alumni, in the James Barry Exhibition Centre in Bishopstown and also at Grand Parade. There will be talks at Blackrock Castle Observatory and a night of music and theatre at the Cork School of Music. At UCC, there will be conversation and music "as gaeilge" in Áras Uí Rathaille, trad music in the Hub, a Chinese cultural experience in the Boole Library, and a walking tour of UCC’s LGBT+ history at the iconic Clock Tower. Visitors can also enjoy live music at the Department of Music, theatre workshops at the Granary Theatre, and a literature evening in the Boole library, while Visitor Services will host children’s story time and guided walks.

Title: AI Agents Are Coming For Your Buildings. Is Your Office Ready?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/ronschmelzer/2025/09/19/ai-agents-are-coming-for-your-buildings-is-your-office-ready/
Time Published: 2025-09-19T14:48:34Z

ByRon Schmelzer, Contributor. So-called intelligent automation has been in buildings for decades. Facility systems could dim lights or adjust temperatures, but only after humans set the rules. Operators fiddled with thermostats, tweaked schedules, and tried to balance comfort with utility bills. These systems followed instructions. They didn’t think. Now Trane Technologies is taking a different approach. This week the company rolled out AI Control and ARIA, an AI agent for buildings. The move marks a push from pre-programmed automation toward adaptive intelligence. It also fits into a broader trend. Companies in many industries are embedding AI agents into daily operations so that machines no longer just assist, they act. Conventional Building Automation Systems work like scripts. Once written, they run. Trane’s new AI Control is closer to a continuously adaptive process. It draws data from weather forecasts, occupancy sensors, and energy meters, then makes adjustments every few minutes. Heating and cooling shift on the fly, not just at set times. Trane says this approach can cut up to 25% of energy use and reduce emissions by as much as 40%. Commercial real estate consumes almost 40% of global energy, so the stakes are high. Even small improvements can translate to billions saved and a measurable climate benefit. “Our vision is to unlock next-generation building performance, delivering both immediate and long-term benefits for our customers and the planet,” said Riaz Raihan, Senior Vice President and Chief Digital Officer, Trane Technologies, according to a recent press release. Unlike a BAS dashboard that waits for commands, ARIA, Trane’s AI building agent, uses a conversational approach with building staff. Ask it for an energy forecast, a performance update, or a system change. It responds, acts, and adapts. That shifts the role of facility managers. Rather than tuning equipment line by line, they supervise a digital operator that never takes a break. Similar patterns are already playing out elsewhere. In retail, autonomous shopping bots fill carts. In finance, algorithmic systems trade at high speed. Buildings could be next. Buildings generate tons of data. HVAC sensors, security feeds, and occupancy trackers continuously churn out data. Yet much of it goes unused because teams can’t respond fast enough. But AI agents can. ARIA’s five-minute optimization cycles allow adjustments that humans could never sustain. Over time, those small improvements can accumulate into large savings. The timing matters. Energy costs remain unpredictable, and regulators are raising the bar. In New York City, Local Law 97 fines owners who exceed emissions caps. Smarter systems don’t just save money, they help properties avoid penalties. These new tools emerged from Trane’s recently launched BrainBox AI Lab, acquired earlier this year to accelerate Trane’s AI innovation pipeline. Positioned as an incubator, the lab focuses on rapid development of control strategies that improve efficiency without manual oversight. Competitors are moving in the same direction. Johnson Controls has been folding machine learning into its OpenBlue platform. Siemens has expanded its Desigo CC system with AI modules that highlight integration across building systems. Trane is trying to stand apart by framing ARIA as a system that doesn’t just provide data, but takes initiative. Across industries, AI agents are seeing increasing adoption. In retail, Walmart, Instacart, and Shopify are testing digital buyers that anticipate needs and complete orders. In finance, trading platforms at JPMorgan and BlackRock use autonomous systems to scan markets and act on risk models. Healthcare companies are also making agentic AI investments, with Philips and GE Healthcare are piloting agents in ICUs that monitor patients continuously, freeing staff from constant checks. The common thread is that tools once seen as assistants now operate independently. Humans step back into oversight roles. For all the potential, adoption in the building industry faces challenges. Trust is the first issue. Managers won’t cede control without safeguards. They need clear explanations for why the system acts, along with an override button when comfort or safety is at stake. These systems also need to prove their value. AI agents need to show that they can deliver better results than their human counterparts. Early deployments will face close scrutiny as facility managers track cost reductions and emissions savings. Other industries show how this might play out. Finance managers resisted algorithmic trading until performance proved to be a competitive advantage. Healthcare hesitated with diagnostic AI until error rates dropped and clinicians saw the benefit. Facility management may follow a similar path. If systems like ARIA catch on, the role of the facility manager changes. Instead of adjusting dampers and thermostats, they’ll monitor, interpret, and decide when to intervene. The work becomes less mechanical and more strategic. That echoes changes in trading floors, hospitals, and retail supply chains. People now guide the agents rather than carry out every action. Trane’s release is a sign of the change in the industry. Within a few years, AI-native control may become the baseline for commercial properties, not a premium add-on. The unknowns lie in the business model. Will operators pay recurring fees for optimization? Will insurers reward AI-run properties with lower premiums? Will tenants expect AI-managed comfort as part of the lease? For now, Trane has made its move. The company is betting that buildings with their own digital operator will define the next stage of “smart.”

Title: Blackrock clinic co-founder among objectors to apartment plans

James M Sheehan. the co-founder of the Blackrock, Hermitage and Galway Clinics, is opposing plans by Cairn Homes for 252 residential ‘build to sell’ units in Blackrock in south Dublin. Mr Sheehan is one of over 30 local residents opposing the scheme which is made up of 236 apartments and 16 houses at Chesterfield, Cross Avenue, Blackrock, Co. Dublin. The 236 apartments are to be located in two blocks ranging in height from five to eight storeys while the 16 homes will be five bedroom terrace houses. In his objection, Mr Sheehan claims that the scheme “will erode the long established character of the neighbourhood”. Mr Sheehan of Cross Avenue, Blackrock contends that “numerous properties will lose their privacy due to the height of the proposed apartment blocks”. He said that the “high rise blocks are inappropriate for this neighbourhood” and argues that it is overdevelopment. Mr Sheehan states that “a low rise development with open spaces could be appropriate such as St Helen’s Wood”. In a comprehensive objection lodged on behalf of Catherine Greene, planning consultant, David Armstrong contends that “the over-development and over-densification of this suburban site will result in a congested form of development and a poor standard of amenity for future residents”. Mr Armstrong contends that “the proposal will result in negative impacts due to loss of residential amenity, visual amenity traffic and overspill parking.” Alan and Charlotte Sullivan of Cross Avenue, Blackrock contend that “there is undoubtedly very significant local opposition to the proposed development”. The O’Sullivans state that “it appears clear to us from the size of the proposed development that the objective is to maximise commercial gain at the expense of amenity in the local area and in disregard of local residents and the local community”. Cairn has been trying to develop the site for the past seven years and last year An Coimisiún Pleanála refused planning permission for 355 build to rent apartments as it would lead to an over-proliferation of build to rent apartments for the area. Addressing ACP’s grounds for refusal on the proliferation of ‘built to rent’ apartments for the area, planning consultants for the new scheme, McCutcheon Halley Chartered Planning Consultants (MHP) state that new scheme in contrast “offers 252 built to sell (BTS) units, which align with the identified housing needs in Dún Laoghaire Rathdown County Council and contributes to addressing Ireland’s housing demand”. MHP say the scheme “will facilitate increased housing supply and choice along Cross Avenue and its environs, which is also located 1km southwest of Blackrock Village”. A decision is due next month.

In association with the International Commission of Jurists [Professor Sundhya Pahuja is ARC Kathleen Fitzpatrick Laureate Professor and Professor of international law at the University of Melbourne. She is the Director of the Laureate Program in Global Corporations and International Law. Dr. André Dao is a postdoctoral research fellow with the Laureate Program] On 30 June 2025, UN Special Rapporteur Francesca Albanese issued a report detailing corporate complicity in Israel’s illegal occupation of Palestinian territory and genocide against the Palestinian people. Special Rapporteurs are independent experts appointed by the United Nations Human Rights Council to investigate and report on specific human rights situations or themes around the world. Albanese provides a forensic account of how corporations across eight sectors, including arms manufacturers, tech firms and extractive industries, are both crucial to, and profit from, Israel’s violations of international law. The report thus provides a map of the specific corporations and sectors involved in the genocide. The report comes at a time when many people are growing uneasy about the increasing power and impunity of corporations, particularly as the state in many places is becoming authoritarian. From modern slavery to climate change, and from war profiteering to genocide, major corporations around the world seem to be able to harm people and planet with impunity. The global movement to hold corporations to account for harmful behaviour has steadily gained ground. But Albanese’s recent report, entitled ‘From economy of occupation to economy of genocide’, is a landmark statement in challenging corporate impunity. It advances a new vision of corporate accountability that understands that many of the world’s harms are the result of states and corporations working closely together. The existing mechanisms for holding corporations to account are inadequate to the task. The most important, in the field of Business and Human Rights (BHR), is encapsulated in a document known as the United Nations Guiding Principles (the UNGPs). The UNGPs were a compromise response to demands by many states and civil society activists for something much stronger than what eventuated, in both substance and form, for holding corporations to account. Formulated by Harvard Professor John Ruggie in the mid-2000s, the success of the UNGPs lies in their widespread acceptance by the business world. This uptake is largely due to their voluntary nature and their reliance on language and tools corporations are familiar with. Chief among these is the stipulation that all corporations should carry out ‘human rights due diligence’. In substance, this is a tool that encourages corporations to investigate and mitigate the risk of potential human rights violations in the same way they would approach more familiar financial or legal risks. But what attracts corporations to the UNGPs is also their weak point for everyone else. Besides being voluntary and not binding, by translating human rights into the language of risk management, due diligence makes it possible for corporations to focus narrowly on discrete harms rather than on the effects of their business models as a whole. And in practice, the human rights risk assessments at the heart of due diligence are often an opportunity for corporations to ‘balance’ presumed economic benefits to vulnerable peoples against actual human rights violations. A similar problem plagues the other core regime of accountability for grievous corporate conduct, international criminal law (ICL). As a mechanism for holding individuals within companies responsible for corporate harms, ICL dates from the Nuremberg trial of directors of IG Farben, the German chemicals manufacturer responsible for amongst other acts, making the Zyklon B gas used in the concentration camp chambers. Unlike BHR, ICL is binding, and punishing individual decision-makers can meet some victims’ demands for justice. But like BHR, it also misses the structural point, both by being confined to individual actors within corporations, and by taking a ‘few bad apples’ approach to corporate misconduct, normalising wider patterns of harm. Even were international criminal responsibility to be extended to corporations themselves rather than the individuals within them, this structural problem would remain, and the deleterious effects of ‘business as usual’ would remain unchallenged. This is particularly problematic when corporations operate within, and often in close partnership with, undemocratic states. As many scholars have detailed, the Holocaust could not have happened without corporate complicity. A few corporate leaders were tried, but most companies complicit with the regime escaped unscathed. Many still operate today. What is less widely known is that Fascists (first the Italian version, then the German version) invented the modern practice of ‘privatisation’. This involved handing over control of state-owned monopolies to corporations. This had the immediate consequence of shoring up business support for the regimes of Mussolini and Hitler. In the longer term, it created a certain pattern of power, whereby economic control and benefit was concentrated in a wealthy, fascist-supporting elite and away from the ‘public’. At the same time, the state maintained its monopoly on legitimate violence, which was re-orientated in service of private corporations. It is telling that the man who popularised the concept of privatisation in the Anglosphere, the management consultant Peter Drucker, originally called it re-privatisation. He meant that giving private corporations responsibility over ‘economic’ life was merely to return to them a responsibility they had held before the late nineteenth century, which had seen the birth of the modern public sector through successive waves of nationalisation and municipalisation. Drucker’s argument sought to naturalise privatisation in modern democratic states. In fact, he was more correct than he realised, but in a different way: long before the 19th century, private corporations had been responsible for engaging in colonial conquest and colonial government. The ‘public’ colony of British India, for instance, was originally ruled for over 200 years by the ‘private’ British East India Company. Colonialism was, in other words, always a form of public-private partnership. Today, many states going “bad” are led by authoritarian populists supported by big business, who are in turn supported by those leaders. Think of the conclave of oligarchs standing behind Donald Trump at his inauguration, Adani’s funding of Narendra Modi after the Gujarat massacre, or the concentration of media ownership among businessmen linked to Victor Orbán in Hungary. This form of company-state relation far exceeds mere ‘corruption’. It represents what we might call empire coming home: a technology of governance from the colonial encounter, used to extend a form of public-private rule over distant peoples, is now turned inwards, upon the state’s ‘own’ people. This intimacy between corporation and state is at the heart of Albanese’s report. Refusing the tendency of Business and Human Rights and international criminal law to focus on discrete, ‘rogue’ behaviour, Albanese insists on understanding corporate crimes in a long historical trajectory. Thus the very first line of the report acknowledges that ‘colonial endeavours and associated genocides have historically been driven and enabled by the corporate sector’. This turn to history then makes it possible to see that the activities of major corporations such as IBM, Caterpillar, and Blackrock in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories is not incidental or aberrant, but part of a longstanding pattern of power. The innovative part of Albanese’s report is that she does not jettison human rights or international criminal law, but instead reworks them so that they can begin to address genocide and other serious harms as the result of a public-private partnership. One of the ways she does this is by refocusing corporate accountability efforts on how corporations’ ‘specific human rights violations may also be constitutive of more structural and systemic violations of international law’. In the case of Palestine, this means that corporate due diligence is not satisfied simply by muddying the evidentiary waters over whether a specific weapons part was used to commit a specific violation. It is the very relationship itself between company and state that enables, among other things, the systemic violation of Palestinians’ right to self-determination. And as Albanese points out, the systemic nature of this violation invalidates ‘paternalistic’ arguments about the economic benefits of continued engagement with Israel’s occupation regime. The response to Albanese’s report has confirmed its significance. Nine days after Albanese filed the report, the US government announced it was imposing sanctions on her for ‘writing threatening letters to dozens of entities worldwide, including major American companies across finance, technology, defense, energy, and hospitality, making extreme and unfounded accusations and recommending the ICC pursue investigations and prosecutions of these companies and their executives.’ These letters to corporations were deemed by US Secretary of State, Mark Rubio, to constitute ‘political and economic warfare, which threatens our national interests and sovereignty.’ The ‘our’ says it all, revealing the US’ own perception about how to understand its ‘national’ interest. When it comes to the genocide in Gaza, as was the case throughout colonial history, public and private interests – and culpability – are inextricably linked.

Title: Bitcoin’s 25% Shot at $125K This Month Sends Traders Flocking to Bitcoin Hyper Presale

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Polymarket bettors have predicted a 25% chance for Bitcoin ($BTC) to rise above $125K this month. It’s currently down to 17% at the time of writing. Earlier today, Bitcoin touched an intraday high of $117,888, bringing it closer in line with bettors’ predictions. The coin reached its all-time high of $124,517 on 14 August 2025, placing it only 6.1% below its ATH. Despite a 2.6% increase in Bitcoin’s price last month, crossing $125K will depend on sustained momentum fuelled by improving macro conditions and strong ETF inflows. Underscoring this bullish setup, Bitwise’s Matt Hogan said this in an interview with CNBC two months ago: The Bitcoin network only produces 450 Bitcoin per day. Yesterday alone, Bitcoin ETFs bought 10,000 Bitcoin. This institutional investment into Bitcoin is a one-time event, it’s going to take years to play out, but I think over the course of the year, there’s going to be this persistent bit where there’s more demand than there is supply. And the natural response to that is […] Bitcoin’s price goes higher. —Matt Hougan, CNBC Interview As $BTC continues to build momentum, its Q4 looks promising, with bettors giving a 79% chance of hitting $125K+ by year-end. This growing confidence hasn’t just lifted $BTC sentiment, it’s spilling over new Bitcoin-based projects like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER), which has raised 16.8M in its presale. The market sentiment is very bullish right now as $BTCgets closer to breaking a new ATH — $125K. While Polymarket suggests that an upside is more likely than a downside, macroeconomic factors such as ETF inflows and Fed cuts in Q4 will have a direct impact on Bitcoin’s price action in the coming weeks and months. In other developments, US spot $BTC ETFs are seeing robust inflows. For starters, the last week saw approximately $2.3B pouring in from prominent names like BlackRock and Fidelity. As the $BTC held in ETFs and treasury hands reduces circulating supply, it makes $BTC scarcer, potentially leading to prices hikes in the future. Furthermore, some crypto analysts highlight several historic timing markers for Bitcoin, such as the 1,065-day post-halving window. Historically, bullish markets have often witnessed parabolic surges around the post-halving timeframe, suggesting that the current setup paves the path for $BTC’s strongest rally yet. With the interest rate cuts, regulatory clarity, increased institutional inflows, and shifting risk perceptions, newer $BTC-backed top altcoins are benefiting from this halo effect. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER), a high-throughput project built to supercharge Bitcoin’s scalability, is drawing strong investor interest as it rides the $BTC’s bullish wave. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) offers Solana speed + $ETH liquidity + $BTC security, unlocking a true high-throughput Layer-2. It will enable instant payments, DeFi, dApps, and MemeFi within the Bitcoin ecosystem. Other exclusive (upcoming) features include: Additionally, the token’s dual-chain utility enhances hedging, liquidity strategies, and governance rights, positioning it as a high-value play in the 2025 market. Bitcoin Hyper’s presale is already flexing serious strength, having raised $16.8M so far, with the next price hike expected in less than 2 days. At today’s presale rate of $0.012945 per $HYPER, a $200 buy bags you roughly 15,450 tokens. But here’s the juicier bit — you can scoop staking rewards at 68% APY if you buy now. That means the same $200 allocation into $HYPER could climb to around $537 by 2025’s end once you add staking yield to the price appreciation. Remember that the staking APY will decrease as more traders stake tokens. The earlier you buy, the higher an APY you’ll benefit from. Learn how to buy Bitcoin Hyper in our guide here. With whales already aping in — including buys of $161.3K and $100.6K in August, $HYPER is shaping up as a rare Layer-2 gem that blends scalability, utility, and fat staking yields with Bitcoin’s unmatched security. Snag $HYPER at lower-tier prices before the next hike. This is not financial advice. Please do your own research before investing in cryptocurrencies.

Title: Indian Bonds Ripe For Rally On Foreign Inflows, BlackRock Says

Time Published: 2025-09-19T06:25:16Z

Indian bonds present an attractive opportunity for foreign investors after a bruising selloff, according to a BlackRock Inc. product strategist. The spread between 10-year debt of India versus the US is near its widest level year-to-date and there’s potential for a reversal, Koay Hui Sien, BlackRock’s head of iShares fixed-income product strategy for APAC ex-Japan, said in an email interview. A rare sovereign rating upgrade last month helps make Indian bonds appealing, she added. “The setup favors renewed foreign inflows,” Koay said, particularly with the Federal Reserve’s interest-rate-cut path into year-end. The Fed reduced rates on Wednesday and signaled more might come this year, which makes debt of other countries more attractive by comparison. Global funds are starting to return after months of subdued international appetite amid tariff-related worries. Foreign purchases of index-eligible Indian bonds hit 104 billion rupees ($1.2 billion) in August, the highest since March — even as yields on India’s 10-year notes rose 19 basis points, the sharpest monthly advance in three years. India’s domestic-driven growth and low dependence on US exports boost its appeal in such an environment, according to Koay. Indian bonds also offer good potential for roll-down return — price gains made as they approach maturity — and that the currently low levels of foreign ownership leave plenty of room for a catch-up trade, Koay said. However, there are still concerns, including the rally in yields last month. On a hedged basis, Indian bonds are underperforming global peers with a 3% gain this year. And worries over heavy supply of longer-duration bonds linger. But that also means “a clear pickup over Asian peers” and with lower volatility, Koay said. Indian 10-year government bonds yield around 6.5%, compared with about 6.2% in Indonesia and 5.9% in Thailand. BlackRock launched its India government bond exchange traded fund in February 2024, four months before the country’s debt was included in JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s flagship emerging market index. Foreign holdings of index-eligible notes have risen by more than a trillion rupees since then.

Δ STBL mimics traditional finance’s zero-coupon strip structures by turning digital assets into a dollar-pegged stablecoin and yield-bearing non-fungible token (NFT), CoinDesk reported Thursday (Sept. 18). The components can be held separately, letting investors keep the part that appeals to them and sell the rest to counterparties that hold different attitudes to risk. “Our mission at STBL is to evolve stablecoins from corporate products into public infrastructure,” STBL co-founder Reeve Collins, who also helped found Tether, said in the report. “For the first time, minters, not issuers, retain the value of reserves. This is the defining shift of Stablecoin 2.0: money that is stable, compliant and built to serve the community.” When a yield-bearing on-chain asset is deposited and locked into the STBL protocol, it splits into a stablecoin (USST) that can circulate and function as collateral or reserves in decentralized finance and a separate, yield-accruing NFT called YLD, according to the report. “When a user who’s already whitelisted with a Franklin Templeton or BlackRock fund locks that asset into STBL, they receive an NFT that controls the vault,” STBL CEO and co-founder Avtar Sehra said, per the report. “You hold the NFT and accrue interest, while the stable asset can be used as collateral, as reserves, or to mint an ecosystem-specific stablecoin aligned with GENIUS Act requirements.” In related news, Tether is planning to match the success it has seen with stablecoins in other countries by bringing a new token to the United States. Advertisement: Scroll to Continue Bo Hines, strategic advisor for digital assets and U.S. at Tether, said the company wants to be “the largest player in the U.S. market.” “We already are abroad, and we want to match that here,” Hines said, adding that two of the customers Tether hopes to serve in the U.S. are underbanked and underserved consumers and enterprise clients, including banks. Meanwhile, Bryce Jurss of Nuvei described to PYMNTS this week a long-term vision for stablecoins in the B2B payments sector in which businesses end up with the tokens on their balance sheets, no matter how their customers pay. “Ultimately, once it does trickle down to the consumer, they may have stablecoins, they might not even know they’re using stablecoins,” Jurss said. “And you’re getting all these faster payments happening on the back end.” Tether Co-Founder’s Startup Wants to Usher in ‘Stablecoin 2.0’ Amazon, Walmart Tap Fall Event Spending for Go-Forward Benchmarks Mastercard Expects Holiday Spending Growth to Slow to 3.6% Indian Payments Firm Pine Labs Seeks $700 Million in IPO We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

I have to say I walked into this illustrious building and the first thing that Secretary Lutnick said was “it is quite like my flat.” We now need to see evidence, or next time we have these meetings we can do it in your home. I am sure everyone would agree that this State Visit has been a remarkable and memorable few days. Mr. Secretary Lutnick, Director Michael Kratsios, and all of our guests from the United States, on behalf of His Majesty’s Government, you are very, very welcome. Your presence here tonight, and in Britain this week, is an honour and, as valued friends and trusted colleagues, thank you for coming here. Mr. Secretary Lutnick, Howard, I am very grateful for the decisive role that you have played in securing our Economic Prosperity Deal earlier this year. Thank you. A deal which lowers tariffs and protects jobs in the automotive, the steel, the aluminium, the aerospace and the agricultural sectors. With your leadership, Britain has been able to be the very first country in the world to successfully negotiate such an agreement and it is also the best agreement. Our agreement shows that, for President Trump, the “art of the deal” is more than just rhetoric, it is the beating heart of his presidency. It is a vindication of the cool-headed approach adopted by both nations and advocated for by our Prime Minister, Keir Starmer, right from the very start. The Tech Prosperity Deal, signed today, is more than just a diplomatic nicety. It is a signal that the special relationship between our two countries means business. In 1944, my very celebrated predecessor as President of the Board of Trade, Churchill, first coined the phrase “special relationship” to describe the US-UK partnership. Formed at a time of war, sustained in times of peace, strengthened in times of adversity, the special relationship today is about the future prosperity of both of our countries. It is about the new technology enhancing the lives and the life chances of both of our peoples. It is the future, and it is founded on the strength of our shared, mutual friendship. Looking around this room, I see leaders of so many brilliant businesses. I want to convey my appreciation, not just for your presence, but for being so invested in modernising the special relationship, ensuring that it is relevant today and into the future. The fact that we are joined tonight by His Royal Highness, the Duke of Gloucester, the Deputy Prime Minister, our Chancellor Rachel Reeves, we have the Secretary of State for DSIT, the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology, and so many ministers and Cabinet ministers from across Government. It is testament to the scale and ambition that we invest as this Government in the special relationship. Even before the State Visit, the trading and investment relationship between our two nations was completely unrivalled. Bilateral investment alone stood at $1.5 trillion. And over the last few days, we have added around $300bn to that total. That is almost a third of a trillion dollars being added by the partnerships announced this week. And we have secured record-breaking US investment across key growth sectors in our economy. We’re seeing big investments in financial services from CitiBank, from Bank of America and BlackRock announcing ambitious expansion plans, creating thousands of jobs from Belfast through to Edinburgh. We’re seeing new commercial partnerships being formed in our nuclear industry – with X-energy and Centrica building 12 advanced modular reactors in Hartlepool. And Amentum expanding its UK workforce by 50%. Prologis are ploughing £3bn into state-of-the-art biometric campuses in Cambridge – it is a massive win for our life sciences sector. During the State Visit, big-hitting British businesses like GSK have announced an extra $30billion of investment into the development of and manufacturing in the United States, and that will happen over the course of the next five years. And the National Grid has affirmed billions of dollars worth of investment into American businesses over the same period of time. They are working with Emerald AI’s Conductor platform and NVIDIA to drive super-efficient energy consumption right through the economy. Sage, one of the UK’s major listed companies, are making significant long-term investments into the US market: $2.3 billion in spending over the next three years. So, transatlantic trade is good for America and it is good for Britain. It is the life blood of the special relationship. The latest iteration, the Tech Prosperity Deal, unlocks growth from the very best of companies. It will endure and it will ensure the technologies will be defining the next 100 years – from AI to quantum computing – and build out our special relationship’s commitment to democracy and liberty, enhanced by our close security, regulatory and commercial cooperation. The Deal goes further by increasing capital flows which will help companies here in the UK and the US not just to build and do business, but to scale and scale at speed. Increased bilateral investment in technology holds the potential to create thousands of jobs and add billions of pounds to our economies. That’s why, when I moved to the Business and Trade job, the very first thing I did was to fly to Washington to close the deal for the Technology Partnership. And I want to share and thank the many, many people across businesses and across Government here who informed these discussions. Months of determined work have paid off for the UK and the USA. Together with the Economic Prosperity Deal, this partnership will secure success for our trillion-dollar tech sectors in the 21st century. My focus now is ensuring that we build on that momentum. I want us to dive into the delivery of this partnership with even greater determination than its design and its deployment. By doing so, we will be writing the next exciting chapter in our special relationship: where we make it easier than ever before for Britain and America to do business and to make, sell, invest, and to grow. Our history shows, that when the two great countries work together there is nothing beyond our reach. That was shown in the beaches of Normandy at D-Day and in the defeat of fascism. It was shown in the discovery of the DNA structure – a collaboration between British and American scientists – that laid the groundwork for the genetic research that revolutionised medicine. And it was shown in the transformation of global communications - with American internet foundations and British World Wide Web – that led the way to the digital world that we now live. And now, with the deals that we have secured, with the partnerships that we have agreed, we can be confident that the future of the special relationship is now stepping up a gear. Thanks to the brilliant businesses that are here today – those who work and trade across the Atlantic – the special relationship endures and it strengthens and thrives. The transatlantic businesses and the opportunities that we created will be transformative into the future and I couldn’t be more excited and proud at that proposal.

Title: A Dividend Cut Just Created A 9.2% Monthly Dividend Bargain
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/brettowens/2025/09/18/a-dividend-cut-just-created-a-92-monthly-dividend-bargain/
Time Published: 2025-09-18T18:45:00Z
Full Content:
ByBrett Owens, Contributor. Most Wall Street “suits” are allergic to dividend cuts. These spreadsheet jockeys sooooo lack imagination. They prefer linear trends—up and to the right. Dividend growers model nicely. Payout “resets” (cuts!) do not. So, there is often a knee-jerk reaction from analysts to sell every divvie slash they see. Same goes for most individual income investors. These vanilla beans sold BlackRock Health Sciences Term Trust (BMEZ) late last week when BlackRock sliced the dividends for three of its popular funds. The weaker hands sold. Big payouts remain. As contrarians, we’re intrigued. Dividend cuts, ironically, often mark the start of opportunity. Here’s what the knee-jerk sellers miss: In other words, the “bad news” is already priced in. This nifty 9.2% monthly dividend can now be had for 89 cents on the dollar. Why the deal? Because this is a CEF. Unlike ETFs or mutual funds, CEFs raise a fixed pool of capital at launch. After that, shares just trade back and forth on the exchange. That creates inefficiencies—often big ones. When investors sell (like last week), they often dump CEF shares without looking at the underlying assets. Discounts widen, even if the portfolio is perfectly fine. That’s when dividend deal hunters like us step in! CEF discounts open the door. Politics blow it off the hinge. Wall Street is worried about President Trump letting RFK Jr. “go wild on health” from his perch at HHS. The first-level fear is that pressure on drug prices is bearish for healthcare. But remember Trump 1.0: big pharma lagged, while biotech and medical device makers soared. BMEZ’s portfolio today is a blend of biotech and medical device makers with big potential. These aren’t cartel-like insurers or big pharma names whose product prices the government may cap. BMEZ holds the kinds of firms that benefited the most in Trump 1.0: healthcare innovators that thrive when regulation lightens. Top holding Alnylam (ALNY) is a pioneer in “RNA interference”—a cutting-edge class of medicine that essentially turns off disease-causing genes. Alnylam’s therapeutics are being explored for treating genetic, heart and neurological diseases. Bad genes? Alnylam fixes them. The company’s research benefits from less regulation. The stock soared under Trump 1.0, racking up 300%+ gains. And the sequel is shaping up to be even bigger with ALNY already up 90%: Number two BMEZ holding, Veeva Systems (VEEV), gained a fantastic 570% under Trump 1.0.

Title: Dogecoin’s first ETF launches after SEC eases pathway for crypto funds to enter public markets

Ben Weiss is a crypto reporter at Fortune. Investors can now speculate on a dog-themed memecoin straight from their brokerage accounts. On Thursday morning, the U.S.’s first spot Dogecoin ETF went live on Cboe BZX, an exchange headquartered in Chicago. Spot funds give traders exposure to current asset prices—as opposed to futures or other derivatives. Dogecoin is widely considered to be the first memecoin, or a cryptocurrency that references an online joke and doesn’t have underlying utility. Dogecoin derives its name from a popular meme that features a Shiba Inu dog and absurdist text, like “so amaze.” The launch of a memecoin ETF illustrates the shift in the regulatory landscape over the past year in favor of the crypto industry—especially since blockchain advocates battled with the Securities and Exchange Commission for years to launch a spot ETF for Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Now, especially with new rule changes voted in Wednesday by the SEC, the floodgates for funds tied to digital assets appear to be wide open. The ETF issuer Rex Financial and its sister firm Osprey Funds, which specializes in crypto investments, jointly manage the Dogecoin ETF. The fund is listed with the ticker DOJE. The price of the memecoin is up 7% over the past 24 hours to almost 29 cents, according to data from Binance. “We’re doing something nobody’s ever done, and it’s catching a lot of people by surprise,” Greg King, CEO of REX Financial, told Fortune. The Dogecoin ETF, like other crypto funds, lets traditional investors and institutions, who usually don’t have access to crypto exchanges like Coinbase, speculate on cryptocurrencies from within traditional brokerage platforms such as Fidelity. Proponents have long said crypto ETFs can attract new investors to allocate portions of their portfolio into digital assets, but for years, the SEC blocked spot crypto ETFs from going live. The agency cited fears of market manipulation for its hesitancy. In January 2024, after a prolonged legal battle with the crypto financial firm Grayscale, the agency relented, and the U.S.’s first spot Bitcoin ETFs came to market, including an entry from the asset management titan BlackRock. Since their launch, over $57 billion in capital has flowed into spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S., according to data from the crypto analytics site SoSoValue. The success of the Bitcoin funds opened the floodgates for new crypto ETFs to hit the market. Soon, in July 2024, BlackRock and other competitors launched ETFs for Ethereum, the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency. And, one year later, Rex Financial and Osprey Funds launched the first ETF for Solana, another digital asset. On Wednesday, the SEC approved rule changes to allow exchanges to adopt generic listing requirements for digital asset ETFs. Rather than needing to pass through customized, manual review from the SEC, ETF issuers will send their proposals directly to the exchanges. That fast-tracking has at least one regulator worried. “The Commission is passing the buck on reviewing these proposals and making the required investor protection findings, in favor of fast tracking these new and arguably unproven products to market,” wrote Caroline Crenshaw, a commissioner at the SEC, in a statement alongside the agency’s decision. On Thursday, Rex Financial and Osprey Funds also launched the first spot ETF for XRP, another cryptocurrency. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Title: BlackRock And Other Institutions Stacking XRP? Why A Major Supply Shock Could Be In The Works
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/big-institutions-stacking-xrp/
Time Published: 2025-09-18T18:00:06Z
Full Content:
Crypto analyst Versan Aljarrah has made a bullish case for XRP, stating that a major supply shock is inevitable. He claimed that BlackRock and other major institutions have been quietly accumulating for a while, which is why he believes investors should not sell their XRP. In an X post, Aljarrah stated that an XRP supply shock is inevitable, as JPMorgan, BlackRock, and major institutions have been quietly buying for years, while retail investors are being shaken out. He added that the Fed, stablecoins, and tokenized assets are all part of the same play and that this is digital gold, in reference to XRP, in motion. In a YouTube video, he further explained how he expects a significant amount of the world’s liquidity to pass through XRP. He noted that the altcoin and its ecosystem are built for infinite scalability. As such, he expects tokenization, stablecoins, and other on-chain activities to primarily take place on the XRP Ledger, which increases XRP’s utility. Aljarrah asserted that there is no ceiling for the XRP price and that it all depends on the demand for the altcoin. He remarked that the price will have to continue rising to accommodate this increasing demand. The analyst described market cap as nothing and that price action is simply determined by utility. It is worth mentioning that he recently declared that XRP’s circulating supply is smaller than market participants think. Another analyst, David, who was on the podcast with Aljarrah, said that those who keep alluding to XRP’s market cap as the reason it cannot reach these ambitious targets are short-sighted. He noted how years ago, no one would have imagined that a single company would be valued in trillions of dollars. As such, he believes there is no reason why XRP cannot reach such heights at some point. In another X post, Aljarrah said that for XRP to reach $100, it will start with these big players quietly accumulating. He again asserted that banks, financial institutions, and investors have been building positions for years and buying billions of XRP, while retail investors are being shaken out. The analyst explained that this accumulation reduces circulating supply and triggers the first real supply shock. Furthermore, he explained that the XRP rally from $100 to $1,000 requires widespread integration into the global financial system. Aljarrah remarked that at this level, the altcoin shifts from being a retail speculative asset to a functional utility as it becomes the preferred settlement mechanism for banks, stablecoins, and tokenized assets. The analyst also believes XRP will reach $10,000 once it can absorb the global liquidity. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $3.08, up over 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: Pundit Shares ‘XRP Endgame’: What To Watch Out For With Ripple

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Crypto pundit Pumpius is drawing attention to what he calls the “XRP Endgame,” saying all the key pieces are falling into place for Ripple and its token. According to him, these shifts put XRP in a rare position to rise above other digital assets. Global rules and banking standards are also moving in Ripple’s favor at the same time. Pumpius stresses that Ripple’s victory in its long fight with the SEC is not just a legal win but a turning point. After years in court, XRP now has the strongest legal clarity of any cryptocurrency in the U.S. He also points to Ripple’s launch of RLUSD, its enterprise stablecoin backed by reserves at BNY Mellon. Pumpius notes that this connection matters because BNY Mellon safeguards trillions in assets for global giants, including BlackRock and the U.S. Treasury. Tying a stablecoin to XRP’s payment rails creates what he calls a “stable reserve army” that strengthens trust in Ripple’s network. On the banking front, Pumpius explains that Ripple is not only licensed as a money service business but has also applied for the highly difficult New York banking charter. He adds that Ripple has taken it a step further by applying for a Federal Reserve master account, the highest privilege in the U.S. banking system. If granted, Ripple would not just compete with banks but effectively act as one, placing XRP at the center of financial settlements. Pumpius notes that nearly 20 XRP spot ETFs are awaiting approval. If greenlit, these funds could open the doors to trillions of dollars from institutional investors and push XRP into the ranks of Wall Street assets overnight. Another major shift is the migration to ISO 20022, a global messaging standard that all major banks must adhere to by November. Pumpius points out that XRP has been ready for this for years, meaning RippleNet can easily connect with traditional banking rails the moment the change takes effect. Additionally, he notes that XRP is in the liquidity tokenization plan of DTCC, the world’s largest settlement utility. At the same time, he notes that the DNA Protocol is quietly developing biometric and genomic identity tools on the XRP Ledger. This step could solve Know Your Customer checks at the deepest level, blending finance and digital identity in a way no other blockchain has achieved. Ripple benefits as he notes the rise of a supportive political environment. A pro-crypto administration is pushing laws that fit Ripple’s long-term playbook. With regulators and policymakers leaning in the same direction, he believes the stage is set for XRP to move into its endgame.

This setup lets DBS clients trade RLUSD for sgBENJI tokens, allowing them to “rebalance their portfolios into a relatively stable asset 24/7 and within minutes, while earning yield during periods of volatility,” the companies said. As the partnership progresses, DBS will explore helping customers unlock liquidity by using their sgBENJI tokens as collateral, the release added.

Title: Trump Pals The Ellison Boys Gonna Save CBS And TikTok From Woke Bias!

Time Published: 2025-09-18T15:02:02Z

Sounds like President Trump is inching closer towards his wish to be king of all media and star of every stage! He coyly hinted on his shitty web platform on Monday: The big Trade Meeting in Europe between The United States of America, and China, has gone VERY WELL! It will be concluding shortly. A deal was also reached on a “certain” company that young people in our Country very much wanted to save. They will be very happy! I will be speaking to President Xi on Friday. The relationship remains a very strong one!!! President DJT And Trump’s sherpa of deals/ mean drunk/ Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said there was a “framework for a deal” for a TikTok sale, though he has said the words “framework for a deal” eleventy-hundred times. Through the months of Trump’s insane pingponging deals with China we have learned that “framework” and “deal” are two very different things. Though at least this is better than the “handshake for a framework” Howard Lutnick said they had back in June. So on Friday are Trump and Scott Bessent really, finally going to get that deal from China on those rare earth minerals, the ones US tech companies need to make all of their AI chips, planes, and high-tech gadgets that Trump screwed them out of by self-embargoing the US? It’s concepts of a framework for maybe! Subscribe! But anyway, word on the street, aka CBS and the Wall Street Journal, is that the deal old Pappy was going on about up there is the potential sale of TikTok to Oracle, whose CEO is his close pal Larry Ellison, and some private equity firms. If the name rings a bell, it’s because Larry Ellison’s son David is the new chairman and CEO of Paramount, after completing a merger between Paramount (CBS’s parent company) and Ellison’s company, Skydance. And both father and son are longtime Republican donors. And father Larry may be richer than Elon Musk now! At least he’s not in on the deal. Oh, and now Paramount Skydance is reportedly in talks to buy Warner Brothers Discovery, too, the parent company of CNN. Those Ellison boys are making the kind of cross-platform Republican media control that Project 2025 once only dreamed of! How long until somebody greenlights that immigration reality show that Kristi Noem denied she was workshopping? TikTok being forced under his thumb has apparently long been a wish of Trump’s, at least since app users first ground his gears back in 2020 by registering to attend his rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, with no intention of showing up, causing his delicate ego embarrassment when the yuge surging crowd he was expecting turned out to be a mere trickle. He raged for TikTok to be BANNED, because something something Chinese spies, and Congress passed an act that banned the app unless its algorithm was put under the control of a US company. And Joe Biden signed it! Remember that extra-stupid hearing with TikTok’s CEO Shou Chew, with Tom Cotton refusing to accept that he is from Singapore, which is a whole different country than China, and how embarrassingly pig-ignorant the senators were about the basics of how the Internet even works? But, the Chinese government doesn’t and has never owned TikTok. A Chinese man founded it and is still 20 percent of the board, but the company was never incorporated in China. There has been no evidence that the Chinese government ever had access to user data, much less that they were using it to spy on dissidents or Americans making cucumber salads. TikTok is owned by ByteDance Ltd., which is headquartered in the Cayman Islands, and TikTok Inc. is headquartered in Los Angeles and Singapore. And its servers — ORACLE servers, in fact — dish out its secret-sauce algorithm from Virginia. Sixty percent of ByteDance is currently owned by non-Chinese global institutional investors including Susquehanna International Group (majority shareholder Jeff Yass), the Carlyle Group, General Atlantic, KKR, BlackRock, and Tiger Global Management; 20 percent of the firm is owned by Beijing-based founder Zhang Yiming, and 20 percent is owned by employees. But Congress and Biden decided to ban the app anyway, after Trump had said it was a CHINESE SPY EMERGENCY. And then some curious things happened! Jeff Yass, the managing director of Susquehanna International Group, the company that is also the largest shareholder of TikTok’s parent company, bought two percent of Digital World Acquisition Corporation, which merged with Trump Media & Technology Group, making its share price surge 140 percent, defibrillating Trump’s flatlining company. And then right before the ‘24 election, the TikTok algorithm underwent a noticeable shift, and Trumpy content began appearing in people’s feeds when it hadn’t before. And TikTok CEO Shou Chew attended Trump’s inauguration in January. And after his win, Trump credited TikTok with helping him win more young voters, so he loved it again and decided to save it, even going to the Supreme Court to try to stop them from enacting the ban he himself had asked Congress to pass. The deadline for a sale has since been extended four times already, and has now been pushed off until December 16. The Wall Street Journal has more details of the prospective deal: The company’s board would stay the same, except that Zhang Yiming’s stake would be reduced to less than 20 percent, and a consortium of US companies, including Susquehanna International, KKR, General Atlantic Oracle, Silver Lake, and Andreessen Horowitz would control 80 percent of the company. A new US entity would be created, with a board with one member designated by the US government, which is unheard of. And the US company would license the magic algorithm, putting it into a new US version of the app, so that the Trumpy board would be able to customize it and make it massage everybody’s feed this way and that, promoting the reach of some accounts and limiting access to others. Meanwhile, CBS under control of its new owner Paramount has a whole other vibe. Paramount Global and CBS CEO George Cheeks hasn’t been fired (yet), but he obeyed in advance. The Late Show with Stephen Colbert was cancelled before the deal even went down, and Trump’s claims against 60 Minutes for making Kamala Harris look too smart got settled for a $16 million donation to his presidential library before the merger was approved. And CBS News employees say Ellison the younger broke his promise not to politicize their news reporting almost immediately, reportedly entering talks to buy The Free Press, owned by anti-woke “free speech” crusader Bari Weiss, who got her start ratting out professors for being pro-Arab, for “well above” $100 million and installing her into some kind of a senior leadership role to tone-police the reporting at CBS News. PREVIOUSLY! And Ellison brought on a conservative thinktanker from the Hudson Institute, Kenneth R. Weinstein, to be an ombudsman rooting out any “complaints of bias” that might aggrieve conservatives at CBS. But it all doesn’t go far enough for everybody on the Right, of course. Now at least one Federalist Society weirdo is proposing that the government shut down Bluesky, and Discord too. But social media sites, they’re not just for cat memes! Businesses do about $15 billion in sales a year on TikTok. And TikTok and Discord have been critical to documenting human rights abuses, and organizing protests, such as recently in Nepal. There’s many times more young people in the US and around the world on Discord (614 million users) and on TikTok (2 billion users) than who are watching 60 Minutes (about 8 million viewers) so, of course the dominionists want to dominate it. And whatever other platforms they can get their filthy paws on, to better control every sphere of American life. Oh did they throw Jimmy Kimmel off the air, “indefinitely”? They did that last night too, with the FCC threatening that ABC’s broadcast license was in danger after Kimmel criticized the regime’s response to the assassination of Charlie Kirk.

Title: Best Crypto To Invest In As Ethereum Eyes $5.5K Ahead Of $XRP ETF Launch

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Ethereum ($ETH) is under the spotlight after Fundstrat’s Tom Lee reiterated his bullish stance, stating that $ETH could reach $5.5K by mid-October. He further added that both Bitcoin and Ethereum could make a ‘monster move’ in the next three months. Lee explained that the driver for this price rise will be the Federal Reserve’s expected monetary easing, including the 0.25% rate cut. He believes that this liquidity injection will primarily benefit Bitcoin and Ethereum, making them the biggest winners of the Fed’s new policy. Alongside $ETH, $XRP is also drawing attention, with the upcoming launch of the REX-Osprey $XRP ETF (under the ticker XRPR). Nate Geraci, president of NovaDius Wealth Management, says XRPR will be a ‘litmus test’ of investor demand for traditional spot $XRP ETFs. These developments also highlight why early opportunities in emerging projects like Best Wallet Token ($BEST) and SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) place them among the best crypto to invest in now. On September 17, 2025, the SEC approved rule changes that simplify the listing process for spot crypto ETFs, marking a significant regulatory milestone that opens the door for spot ETFs. Before this rule, every exchange had to file an individual 19b-4 rule change application for each new spot crypto ETF, resulting in long timelines and delays. This made matters more complicated for smaller players as issuers and exchanges needed legal teams and months of lobbying to get approvals. The new SEC rule paves the path for $XRP ETF approval, which was in regulatory limbo despite strong market demand. On the other hand, Fundstrat MD and Head of Technical Strategy Mark Newton’s bullish forecast of $ETH reaching $5.5K was absorbed by the market, alongside news of the SEC’s ETF rule change, which strengthened the positive momentum. Moreover, these developments lower barriers for retail on-ramps, reduce regulatory friction, and create opportunities for emerging altcoins like $BEST and $SUBBD – and OGs like $ETH – to shine. Read on to discover why these are the best crypto to invest in now. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is the core power behind the Best Wallet app, a next-generation, multi-chain, non-custodial crypto hot wallet designed to dominate Web3 and beyond. As a utility token, $BEST offers an edge, giving real cost savings, presale access, and iGaming-fueled rewards all within the Best ecosystem. USPs of $BEST include: $BEST is currently priced at $0.025655, while the listing price has been set at $0.0225. So the presale gives early adopters a competitive edge. If you invested $100 in $BEST today, it could grow to approximately $137.26 by the end of 2025 through price appreciation. When factoring in the token’s generous 83% staking APY, you could reap roughly $251.19, a 151% gain by year-end. The presale has already raised $15.9M+, with traction already proving a strong demand and high staking returns. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) offers one of the most attractive upside profiles among utility tokens this year. $SUBBD powers an AI-driven Web3 content creator platform, providing fans with access to premium content, exclusive drops, and direct creator interactions. Considering the content creator economy could reach $480B by 2027, according to Goldman Sachs estimates, this gives $SUBBD the potential to be among the strongest plays of 2025. SUBBD is a platform for creators and fans alike, with attractive perks for both. As a creator, you’ll have access to an AI assistant for chats, scheduling, editing, and monetization. The ecosystem enables frictionless global payments in crypto and fiat, and cuts out the need for costly middlemen – like agents. Meanwhile, as a fan, holding $SUBBD means AI-enhanced interactions, discounts, and access to exclusive content, as well as AI tools. You can also stake your tokens for 20% APY and unlock rewards, beta features, and more. That attractive blend of AI and content creation has seen $SUBBD raise $1.1M+ through its presale, with no signs of momentum slowing. $SUBBD’s current price is $0.05645, although the next price rise is expected in less than three days. Early adopters can also secure a fixed staking APY of 20% for the first year, after which staking transitions to a platform benefit model, rewarding active ecosystem participation. According to our $SUBBD Price Prediction guide, $SUBBD could reach $0.438 by the end of 2025, representing an upside of around 676% for early adopters. If you invest $100 in $SUBBD today, that investment could grow to around $775.90 by the end of 2025 purely from price appreciation. Additionally, the 20% staking APY would yield an extra $20 in rewards, bringing the total to approximately $795.90. Learn how to buy SUBBD Token here. This combination of explosive growth potential, steady staking returns, and early-stage entry makes SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) one of the most compelling high-upside crypto opportunities in 2025. Currently trading at around $4.5K, Ethereum ($ETH) is predicted to reach $5.5K by mid-October. Analysts attribute the price drive to rising institutional inflows, increased ETF demand, technical breakouts, and a high percentage of $ETH supply being staked. $ETH’s trading volume has shot up by 27% in the past 24 hours, reaching $47.6B, and its market cap is up by 1.6%, reaching $552B. CoinMarketCap users are also considering an upside of $4.7K to $4.8K for Ethereum, if it holds at $4.5K. BlackRock buying $25.4M Ethereum is also fueling a potential market rally for $ETH, and we’re likely to see more upside in the near future. Furthermore, macroeconomic factors like the Fed rate cuts, regulatory clarity, and accelerating stablecoin adoption could add to the bullish momentum. Buy your $ETH on Binance and other leading exchanges, while $BEST and $SUBBD can be bought from their official websites. This isn’t financial advice. The cryptocurrency market can be highly volatile. Always do your own research before making any investments.

BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has expanded its global executive committee by adding 20 top leaders, reported the Financial Times. Among the new appointees are Sarah Melvin, head of the European business, and Mike Pyle, an investment strategist. The gold standard of business intelligence. Find out more The appointments also include BlackRock deputy COO Stacey Mullin, and Jaime Magyera, head of the US wealth and retirement unit. The asset manager also established a formal management committee, which includes senior executives such as COO Rob Goldstein and CFO Martin Small. “This group will help define BlackRock’s long-term vision, strategy, culture and principles,” as detailed in a letter from CEO Larry Fink and president Rob Kapito seen by the publication. Both Fink and Kapito are members of this newly formalised group. Don’t let policy changes catch you off guard. Stay proactive with real-time data and expert analysis. The changes come as BlackRock aims to increase its market value over the next five years. At the end of June 2025, the firm managed assets totalling more than $12.5tn. Fink has recently overseen the acquisition of several firms, positioning BlackRock to capitalise on the growing private markets sector. Martin Small’s new role as co-chair of the global operating committee, alongside Rob Goldstein, signals their potential as successors to Fink, the FT noted. Meanwhile, vice-chair Mark McCombe is set to retire in the upcoming year. BlackRock has not provided a statement regarding these internal changes. “This expansion reflects our commitment to evolving with purpose and unlocking the full potential of talent across the firm,” Fink and Kapito wrote. “We view this as part of an ongoing refinement of our leadership structure — one that ensures we remain responsive to our clients, our people and the opportunities ahead.” Earlier this month, BlackRock secured the necessary approvals to operate in Kuwait.

Jack Mallers, co-founder and CEO of Twenty One Capital, told NYSE TV that he expects Bitcoin to climb much higher from current levels. According to Mallers, the size of global wealth available for savings gives Bitcoin room to grow in a big way. He made the bold remark that Bitcoin could be “100 to 200 times from here,” and his firm’s buying behavior appears to follow that view. According to Mallers, total global wealth across assets like stocks, property, gold and art is about $900 trillion. He argued roughly $400–500 trillion of that is used mainly as savings. Right now, Mallers said, Bitcoin’s market value sits near $2 trillion. At the price cited in reports — about $115,570 per coin — he sees a path for dramatic expansion if Bitcoin captures only a slice of that savings market. Jack Mallers says, “#Bitcoin will 200x from here.” “Bitcoin is going after a $400-500 trillion market, and it’s only $2 trillion.” pic.twitter.com/urpR8HelFO — Maestro (@GoMaestroOrg) September 16, 2025 Reports have disclosed that since April, Twenty One Capital has acquired 43,514 BTC, a haul worth roughly $5 billion at current prices. The firm has backing from players such as Tether, Bitfinex, and SoftBank, and it plans to merge with SPAC Cantor Equity Partners to pursue a public listing. Mallers’ team has been buying aggressively, and the stash already exceeded the firm’s initial target by about 1,500 BTC. Several high-profile figures have also made bullish calls, and their forecasts are often cited alongside Mallers’ views. According to public remarks, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has suggested Bitcoin could reach $700,000. Anthony Scaramucci of SkyBridge has said he expects Bitcoin to hit about $200,000 by the end of 2025. Bill Barhydt, CEO of Abra Global, has outlined a base-case of $350,000 and a more aggressive scenario as high as $700,000. These estimates differ in timing and method, but they share a common theme: large upside is possible if demand and adoption keep rising. Based on reports, Mallers’ firm is joining a larger group of companies that hold Bitcoin as a reserve asset. Michael Saylor’s Strategy has accumulated 638,985 BTC — a figure that dwarfs most other corporate treasuries and is valued near $74 billion. Mining companies such as MARA Holdings hold about 52,477 BTC. One important contrast is funding approach: Strategy leaned on debt to build its position, while Twenty One Capital has avoided that route so far.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Title: Tether, Tokenization Pioneers Unveil STBL Protocol Splitting Principal From Yield
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/09/18/tether-tokenization-pioneers-unveil-startup-focused-on-genius-aligned-digital-dollars
Time Published: 2025-09-18T10:21:38Z
Full Content:
Traditional finance has long had a way of splitting capital from coupons, allowing investors to separate interest-payment flows from the principal. Now, a team of stablecoin and blockchain-based real-world asset (RWA) pioneers is doing the same for tokenized assets. A new startup, STBL, emulates TradFi's zero-coupon strip structures by converting digital assets into a dollar-pegged stablecoin and yield-bearing non-fungible token (NFT). Just as with the traditional equivalent, the components can be held separately, allowing investors to keep the part that appeals to them and sell the other bit to counterparties with different attitudes to risk. The product, currently in beta testing, goes beyond just packaging risk into different tranches. It also widens the stablecoin issuance model. With regular stablecoins, like USDT, the issuing company, in this case Tether, keeps the returns on the Treasuries they hold to maintain the token's peg to the dollar. It's profitable business, Tether reported $4.9 billion net profit in the second quarter. With STBL, whoever deposits a tokenized asset into the system becomes the minter and keeps the returns. “Our mission at STBL is to evolve stablecoins from corporate products into public infrastructure,” said STBL co-founder Reeve Collins, who was also a cofounder of Tether. “For the first time, minters, not issuers, retain the value of reserves. This is the defining shift of Stablecoin 2.0: money that is stable, compliant, and built to serve the community.” When a yield-bearing on-chain asset — this could be any yield-bearing RWA, such as Franklin Templeton’s BENJI, BlackRock’s BUIDL or Ondo’s USDY — is deposited and locked into the STBL protocol, it splits into a stablecoin (USST) that can circulate and serve as collateral or reserves in decentralized finance (DeFi) and a separate, yield-accruing non-fungible token (NFT) called YLD. The design is intended to remain a non-security in spirit and align with the U.S. GENIUS Act and other regulatory frameworks by separating principal from yield, said CEO Avtar Sehra, who is also a co-founder of the project and was CEO and founder of Kaio (formerly Libre Capital). “When a user who’s already whitelisted with a Franklin Templeton or BlackRock fund locks that asset into STBL, they receive an NFT that controls the vault,” Sehra said in an interview. “You hold the NFT and accrue interest, while the stable asset can be used as collateral, as reserves, or to mint an ecosystem-specific stablecoin aligned with GENIUS Act requirements.” In the year or so before STBL started up, Sehra and Collins were looking at how RWAs or tokenized securities could be used in DeFi; asking how they worked as collateral; how money market funds became the reserves for minting stablecoins, and so on. There had been a view that wrapping an asset, that is taking a tokenized security and placing it into a vault, meant the asset no longer counted as a security as far as U.S. regulations were concerned. But it's not clear that wrapping something "deviates from or extracts the security-like essence" of the asset, Sehra said. To ensure the USST stablecoin component isn't viewed as a security required a mechanism to maintain the dollar peg. This is achieved by ensuring it is slightly over collateralized coupled with an incentive system related to mint fees and burn credits should deviation happen in a volatile market. Sehra referred to STBL's peg-maintenance system as “synthetic” rather than “algorithmic.” “The reason I call it a synthetic is because, even though it has this interest-rate algorithmic component to it, it is 103% over collateralized with pure money market assets,” he said. “As a result of this novel structure, eligible participants that hold permitted RWAs can mint and burn compliant stablecoins. So while minters can hold the yield, the stable asset can be openly used without breaking the non-yield bearing requirements of the GENIUS Act. That's exactly how STBL operates.” The protocol’s decentralized governance token, also called STBL, has been added to Binance Alpha, Binance Futures and Kraken Spot, and will list on other spot exchanges soon, Sehra said. The Sept. 16 debut of the STBL governance token has been lauded as one of the most successful token generating events of 2025, Sehra added. It launched at $100 million fully diluted value, and demand pushed it over $1 billion. It is currently at $1.3 billion, having hit an all time high of about $2.3 billion within 24 hours. The next steps involve a $100 million minting using Franklin Templeton’s BENJI token, Sehra said, and also the announcement of several other partnerships, including with a U.S. based payments firm. The protocol is due to open to the public in the fourth quarter.UPDATE (Sept. 19, 11:46 UTC): Rewrites headline to remove ambiguity.

Groq, a company specialising in AI inference technology, has announced a new funding round of $750m, resulting in a post-money valuation of $6.9bn. The financing round was led by US-based growth investment company Disruptive, which has invested nearly $350m in Groq to date. The gold standard of business intelligence. Find out more Groq also secured notable investments from BlackRock, Neuberger Berman, Deutsche Telekom Capital Partners, and a major mutual fund manager based on the US West Coast. Existing backers such as Cisco, Samsung, Altimeter, D1, 1789 Capital, and Infinitum also participated in this round. Since its establishment in 2016, Groq is said to have contributed substantially to the infrastructure of the US AI Stack. The company has been focused on developing its language processing unit and GroqCloud technologies, which aim to provide cost-effective and high-speed computing solutions. These products currently support over two million developers along with various Fortune 500 companies globally. Don’t let policy changes catch you off guard. Stay proactive with real-time data and expert analysis. The latest influx of funding is anticipated to bolster Groq’s global outreach, enhancing its existing infrastructure across North America, Europe, and the Middle East. This expansion aligns with a recent directive from the White House promoting the international distribution of US-based AI technologies. Groq founder and CEO Jonathan Ross said: “Inference is defining this era of AI, and we’re building the American infrastructure that delivers it with high speed and low cost.” In May 2025, Groq was designated as an official inference provider for HUMAIN, an AI enterprise based in Saudi Arabia. This collaboration supports HUMAIN’s goal of advancing economic structures through comprehensive AI capabilities. Groq had also established a data centre in Dammam, Saudi Arabia, which has been operational since February. The facility is part of Saudi Arabia’s $1.5bn initiative to enhance AI development within the region. Groq has also announced the availability of OpenAI’s models gpt-oss-120B and gpt-oss-20B on GroqCloud. These models feature full 128K context capabilities with immediate response times and integrated server-side tools from deployment on Groq’s optimised platform. Disruptive founder, chair, and CEO Alex Davis said: “As AI expands, the infrastructure behind it will be as essential as the models themselves. “Groq is building that foundation, and we couldn’t be more excited to partner with Jonathan and his team in this next chapter of explosive growth.”

Title: K.M., the power brokers, the KasseloNikolakis clan and the Piri Reis, drought in Athens (right before elections?), Blackrock and its interest in PPC and Hellenic Railways

Time Published: 2025-09-18T06:26:39Z

Hello, Mitsotakis was very careful yesterday in his first interview after the Thessaloniki International Fair on Antenna (with Hatzinikolaou). He dropped the line, for good measure, that it is the people who elect the prime minister and not the power brokers, but I would say he should rather be hoping that… the power brokers do the electing. Because that seems to be the only sure way for him to get re-elected, since these so-called brokers have an unfailing instinct for making the wrong choice! Since 2023 we’ve seen the “ready-made Nikos,” then Kasselakis, now Tsipras stepping down and Dendias stepping in; generally, necessity becomes virtue. I noted carefully that he said nothing about Karamanlis and Samaras, because as we said yesterday…softly, quietly, as they say. KYSEA – Piri Reis M.M. didn’t much like the warlike tone of the leaks about the joint forces exercise of the Armed Forces, which started, as usual, without prior notice, and was linked to the Piri Reis, which still hasn’t left the port of Smyrna. And he especially didn’t like it because it set a harsh tone ahead of the Mitsotakis–Erdogan meeting next week in New York. That meeting seems to be one of the most critical of this period, since it doesn’t have a concrete “deliverable,” unlike other encounters. It remains to be seen whether it will extend (a little) the calm waters, or mark the start of a new escalation phase. A different tone Of course, just before Dendias left M.M. and delivered the quip about how old the Piri Reis is, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Lana Zochiou, who was briefing diplomatic correspondents, was adopting the diplomatic language: “we are monitoring the issue closely” and “Greece safeguards its sovereign rights.” In short, (once again) a different climate between Vasilissis Sofias Avenue and the Pentagon… Let me note two things: first, these little vessels like the Piri Reis were never aircraft carriers for us to fear them, but we all know what their real job is. And second, be careful not to get burned during the warm-up. Ideas about Libya I understand that in yesterday’s KYSEA discussion, when the issue of flows from Libya toward Crete was being analyzed, Plevris among other things said that the scenario of a more dynamic show of force at sea should be evaluated, if arrivals continue. The central idea is that the images of dinghies arriving in Gavdos and Chania are not flattering, so the government may revise its strategy. No decision was taken, and of course it’s not an easy one. Let me also tell you that the minister responsible for the Coast Guard, Vassilis Kikilias, was absent from yesterday’s session due to a scheduled trip abroad. Gerapetritis and the “blue” MPs Around 17:30 yesterday, a friend of mine saw a lot of movement and many cars at New Democracy’s headquarters on Piraeus Street. I asked and found out that Foreign Minister Giorgos Gerapetritis had called, in coordination with ND’s general director Giannis Smyrlis, the ND MPs who sit on the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee. Participation was almost universal, with 1–2 justified absences, and the discussion lasted more than two hours covering everything. Greek–Turkish relations and Turkey’s broader role, Libya after the announcement of resuming EEZ talks with Tripoli, energy issues, the situation in the Middle East, and the role of the U.S. were all on the table. I’m told the conversation took place in a good climate. After all, if there’s one thing that can be credited to Gerapetritis, it’s that he regularly briefs the parties and, in this case, ND’s MPs. Drought – nightmare – elections Let’s leave current affairs aside now for an issue that, as it unfolds, if not properly assessed and addressed in the next 12–18 months, will explode in the government’s hands, right in the middle of the election period. This is the drought, mainly in the capital. Even with the most optimistic estimates and forecasts—meaning, if it rains or snows more than it did this year and last year—we will just barely make it through 2026, but not 2027. According to experts, the problem is dire. The government has held some talks about whether PPC should take over municipal water companies (or share responsibility), but beyond this the major issue is Athens itself. Immediate solutions are needed there, because as I’m told, they won’t know what to do. Water rationing in Athens in 2026—or 2027? Blackrock and PPC and Athens Airport Let’s leave behind the unpleasant and move on to the pleasant, which are business-related, though they may not materialize, since we’re talking about multibillion-euro deals — and such deals are never easy. So, during these days when Blackrock representatives were in Athens and met with many key officials, they expressed serious investment interest in both PPC (Public Power Corporation) and Athens International Airport “Eleftherios Venizelos.” I find both prospects difficult, not least because they’re not strictly government matters, but still, note the strong interest of a powerful investment organization like Blackrock, which maintains excellent relations with the Trump system in the U.S. The businessmen who go to Dubai for… stem cells And since Piri Reis, drought, Blackrock, etc. are heavy topics, let me switch to something lighter. The entire social scene of Athens, along with certain well-known businessmen, has recently been traveling feverishly to Dubai. Not to enjoy the luxuries the Arab destination has to offer, but because in Dubai they administer stem cell treatments freely, without much procedure or bureaucracy. Stem cell therapies are said to rejuvenate the body and, in any case, are believed to help with everything from baldness and cataracts to osteoporosis and diabetes. Gossip has it that, from the business world, the most frequent travelers to Dubai for stem cell treatments are two prominent and successful businessmen, both residents of the southern suburbs, both known from time to time for their fondness for the opposite sex, and who happen to have very (very) young wives. One is highly successful in the shipping sector and impresses with how well he maintains himself past seventy. The other, nearing seventy, is very successful in commerce and retail, although his company’s stock performance has disappointed shareholders. The U.S. Interior Secretary, Elefsina, and the Great Port The visit of U.S. Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum to Greece last week — the first official visit by a member of the new Trump administration to our country — continues to leave ripples. Beyond the official announcements and smiling photo ops, there was also a hidden agenda behind closed doors. Because, as Konstantinos Karamanlis used to say, “there are things that are said but not done, and things that are not said but are done.” Moving on. In small meetings, I hear the American Secretary put on the table the issue of the Port of Piraeus and the Chinese company Cosco. This matter has been simmering for some time, and Doug brought it to the attention of the relevant authorities. I hear the Americans are looking for alternative solutions in logistics and supply chains. It may not be a coincidence that, as we recently reported, the U.S. state development bank DFC, which has already approved a €125 million fund for investments in those shipyards, will also be putting more money into further developing Elefsina. In light of the new perspective on Piraeus, the Americans’ aim through DFC is to make Elefsina a hub supporting shipping, the energy transition through cutting-edge technologies, the allied fleet, and the development of strategic logistics for commercial shipping, defense, and energy. The new Executive Chairman at PPA By the way, I hear from my sources that if not today, then in the coming days, the new Executive Chairman at PPA (Piraeus Port Authority) will be announced. He is already in Greece and intends to sort out outstanding issues at a peculiar time for the port and Cosco, with the Americans lying in wait. I’m also told that the contractually mandated investments have been delayed, and that may well become the next episode in U.S.–China relations. We’ll see. The “renaissance” of Stadiou Street brings Primark The large property on Stadiou Street — once home to the Fokas department store and later earmarked by Brown for conversion into a hotel — has apparently become a “bone of contention.” According to a fashion industry entrepreneur, the Israeli group backed out, leading e-EFKA to plan a restart of the leasing process. Since a hotel-use permit was ultimately not granted for the building, it is considered certain that the potential buyer will come from the broader clothing–fashion sector. This aligns with the “renaissance” of the area (starting from the beginning of Stadiou Street), with the upcoming opening of the Food Center/Arsakeio expected in early December, and the full renovation of Alpha Bank’s buildings (towards Klafthmonos Square) — developments that have not gone unnoticed by entrepreneurs. The same goes for 2–3 foreign brands investing in promoting Athens as a city-break destination and looking for buildings and facilities in the area. Indeed, according to the same entrepreneur, the well-known retail chain Primark has shown investment interest in entering the Greek market, specifically in central Athens (Syntagma–Omonia). The “clouds” and rebranding for Vardas The historic clothing company Vardas is facing a… barrage of foreclosures. Just yesterday, Wednesday, three auctions for company properties (offices, shops) in Pikermi, Chalandri, Kantza, and Thessaloniki were posted on the electronic platform. These auctions, initiated by private creditors (not banks or servicers), are scheduled for October 1 and 30, though they may be suspended before then. More broadly, the emblematic company, active since the late 1930s, is burdened with serious financial problems, like much of the sector due to successive crises. It should be noted that the foreclosures target General Clothing Construction S.A., which is in “liquidation,” with long-time head Theodoros Vardas as liquidator. According to its 2023 financial statements, the company had accumulated losses of €17.13 million, negative equity, and total liabilities of €46.8 million. It “faces liquidity problems and has overdue obligations to the State, which have been restructured and are being paid in installments totaling €1.36 million, while it has exhausted borrowing options since it is heavily indebted, under new agreements, but is not servicing that debt.” Moreover, on September 9, 2024, the company was served with a European Payment Order from the Wedding District Court in Berlin, Germany. “Following this, the company’s bank accounts were frozen and all staff dismissed. Despite this, management intends to continue operations through consignment sales via third parties,” it is stated. At the same time, however, the historic brand recently unveiled new signs as part of its own rebranding and continues to maintain a presence in the market under the name Varda, essentially through N & T Vardas IKE, run by the next generation — Theodoros Vardas’ daughters, Natalia and Tatiana. The company has 12 stores and an e-shop, and reports positive financial results with rising turnover and profits. 110 analysts and fund managers More than 110 analysts and fund managers — a record number, apparently — participated yesterday in an investor call for GEK TERNA’s new bond. It will have a 7-year maturity and is expected to offer an interest rate slightly above 3% (while today Greece’s 7-year sovereign bond yields 2.9%). The company aims to raise €350–500 million, with the public offering starting on Monday, September 23, and the bond scheduled to trade on the Athens Exchange on September 30. The bonds, with a nominal value of €1,000 each, will be covered 30% by retail investors. G. Gouroukos and the €1 million house in “the Village” A friend who was in Kimolos a few days ago overheard a conversation about shipowner Giorgos Gouroukos. According to what he told me, G.Y. bought a large house — a mansion, really — in Chorio. When I asked what the village was called, my friend explained that Kimolos is the only Cycladic island where the Chora (the capital) is referred to as Chorio (“village”). The price is said to have exceeded €1 million. The shipowner appears to have fallen in love with the island. He immediately made socially-minded donations, covering the costs for the restoration of parts of the main school building, while also donating all the air conditioners. I was also told he reached out to the Afentakeio Foundation of Kimolos, which is soon expected to open a Day Care Center for the Elderly. Aegean: The Israelis and cash flow One of Eftichis Vassilakis’ remarks stood out at the close of yesterday’s Aegean conference call with analysts. After stressing that he remains cautiously optimistic about performance in the coming quarters, he focused on the airline’s cash flows. The reference was clear, as Aegean’s stock came under pressure yesterday (closing down 2.84%) because some investors gave more weight to operating performance (flat sales year-on-year, EBITDA -2% annually), which was affected by competition (capacity increase by a significant number of airlines flying to Greece) and the crisis in the Middle East (suspension of flights to Israel, Lebanon, and Jordan in May–June), rather than the net result, which rose 24% year-on-year — mainly due to €22 million in FX gains from the euro’s appreciation against the dollar and lower fuel prices. It should be noted that according to results, net operating cash inflows amounted to €253 million at the end of June, while excluding lease liabilities, the group showed net cash reserves of €424 million at the end of June, up from €385 million at the end of 2024. The key point, however, is that Aegean has ahead of it the traditionally very strong third quarter, which — besides the strengthening euro and low fuel prices — includes peak summer season and, of course, the routes to Tel Aviv, Beirut, Amman, and Erbil, which were gradually restored from mid-July onward after being suspended in Q2 due to events in the region. To give an idea of scale, the airline’s CEO mentioned that Aegean had nine daily flights to that region, plus various connections from Athens to other destinations, all of which were lost during the suspension. Despite the difficulties, Aegean managed revenue growth above the market average in Q2 and now faces what looks like a strong Q3. Demand remains at satisfactory levels, with load factors at 85% in July–August, while average revenue per flight is expected to be only marginally lower in Q3. In this context, NBG Securities maintained its €19.20 price target for Aegean shares with an “outperform” recommendation — about 40% above current levels. Investments in port infrastructure – Priority on Alexandroupolis The newly established Hellenic Innovation & Infrastructure Fund (HIIF), which will act as the investment arm of the Hellenic Corporation of Assets and Participations (HCAP), has the advantage of enabling the government to push forward major projects implemented by market players and institutions. According to reliable sources, HIIF’s first major move will be in port infrastructure, especially the Port of Alexandroupolis, which seems to be heading towards a major Hub tender. This means the tender will not only include investments in the port but also in the airport and land for logistics. With initial capital of €303 million, HIIF aims to mobilize a total of €1 billion in investments. Why Credia Bank’s stock slipped The Malta Stock Exchange (MSE), headquartered in Valletta at the “Garrison Chapel” in Castille Place, saw HSBC Malta shares fall to an 18-month low of €1.31, as some expected 70% of the bank to be sold for €300 million. The fall of the Maltese bank does not explain yesterday’s sharp drop (-7.64%) in CrediaBank, which had actually managed to pay €200 million for that 70% stake in HSBC Malta. Additionally, Hellenic Bank’s stock is highly concentrated: 57.6% of its share capital is controlled by Thrivest and 36.16% by the Hellenic Financial Stability Fund (HFSF). Since these two shareholders (93.7%) have no reason to sell and are not generally active in the market at present, yesterday’s decline likely had very short-term goals. After all, CrediaBank’s stock has gained +102% in the past quarter and +128% since the start of the year. TITAN is not doing well It could be due to the sharp slide in the dollar exchange rate (€1 = $1.1850). Or investors’ displeasure at a €75 million net profit loss from the sale of its Turkish subsidiary. Or the unfavorable international geopolitical environment. The fact remains: since February 10, when TITAN’s share hit a high of €45.8, things have worsened. On April 7 (“Black Monday” for markets), the stock plummeted to €35.6, later climbed back to €42.3 on May 28 when it cut a €3/share dividend, but never recovered — now hovering at €36.5. Meanwhile, on the derivatives market, more than 400 contracts are giving an additional discount of about 1% or more. Operating profits for H1 rose slightly (+2%), but group net profits fell sharply due to the loss from selling Adocim in Turkey, higher depreciation, and increased minority rights (Titan America). TITAN has slipped to 14th place on the Athens Stock Exchange in terms of market capitalization (€2.8 billion). A lesson in hesitation and insecurity A sudden order to buy 2.6 million Alpha Bank shares appeared at the end of yesterday’s session and then…disappeared from the terminals within seconds. This is indicative of the mood that prevailed yesterday at the Athens Stock Exchange. Tomorrow marks a triple witching day in the Derivatives Market (September triple witching — futures and options on indices and stocks expire simultaneously). With a lack of strong buying interest from abroad, the market is focused on short-term tactical moves and covering basic needs. Trading activity was high, at €245 million, of which €47 million were pre-agreed block trades. The General Index held the 2,020-point level, closing at -0.67%, but during the session it had alarmed the market with a drop of -1.17%, below 2,010 points. At the close, no banking stock was in positive territory, while among large-cap stocks notable declines included: Aegean -2.84% to €13.7, Ellaktor -1.96%, PPC -1.27% to €14, Elvalhalcor -1.25% to €2.76, Jumbo -1.08% to €31.4, and OPAP -0.97% to €19.48. Metlen reacted with gains of +0.60% to €52.7. The burden of private debt weighs on the Trump administration The U.S. federal debt exceeds $37 trillion. Household debt, however, has reached a record $18.7 trillion. This means that each adult in the U.S. owes about $63,000. Official data show that consumer loans surged by $16 billion in July, reaching $5.06 trillion. Over the past five months, consumer credit has increased by $103 billion. Revolving debt (credit cards) rose by $10 billion to $1.31 trillion, the highest since November 2024. Non-revolving credit, which includes auto loans and student loans, rose by $6 billion, reaching a record $3.75 trillion. The proportion of loans more than 90 days past due is increasing, especially in credit card and student loan debt. Notably, 10.2% of total student debt is over 90 days delinquent, based on Q2 2025 data. Explore related questions

Title: Why It’s Hard for Activists and Blockholders to Make a Difference in Banking
URL: https://clsbluesky.law.columbia.edu/2025/09/18/why-its-hard-for-activists-and-blockholders-to-make-a-difference-in-banking/
Time Published: 2025-09-18T04:05:15Z
Full Content:
Activist investors and blockholders are unable to restructure and turnaround poorly performing banks, making it unlikely that they can enhance bank performance and contribute to financial stability. We argue that regulation and supervision hinder the flow of information needed to price risk effectively and as a result weaken the incentive and ability of activists and blockholders to turnaround poorly performing banks. We identify bank opacity due to regulation and supervision as the main cause of weak market discipline by banks (see Mehran and Spatt, 2024).[1] In a previous post, we noted that the regulatory environment in banking interferes with information production as disclosure of some information may be perceived by regulators as potentially causing bank runs. Weak market discipline due to regulation and supervision fuels the control market in bank restructuring, thus leading to larger institutions. In this post, we draw on examples of large investors in the banking industry. In 1989, American businessman Laurence Tisch and his family acquired 8.9 percent of the Bank of Boston. In 1990, they made further disclosures of large investments in Continental Bank, Baybank, and Equimark. Each of these institutions had lost nearly 70 percent of its value following the savings and loan (S&L) crisis.[2] The share acquisitions by the Tisch family were the largest percentage investment in large, regional banks by individual investors and institutions at the time. The media reported in 1991 that the family reduced its investments in two of the banks,[3] selling the investments at a loss. The Tisch family was not the only sophisticated investor to incur losses investing in bank stocks during a crisis. American hedge fund manager Bill Ackman invested about $1 billion in Citigroup for his firm, Pershing Square, following the 2007–2009 financial crisis. He concluded that Citigroup had already written down its bad loans and thus the bank’s stock price might be fair or even undervalued. Yet, the investment produced a loss of $400 million (see Partnoy and Eisinger, 2013).[4] The Tisch and Ackman losses were not exceptions.[5] Investments in bank assets during crises are often underperforming (see Baron et al., 2021).[6] Bank charter value can dissipate when banks are in difficulty, even outside a crisis. Surprisingly, quickly restoring value even by a capital infusion or by changing the bank’s management is not easy. (The demise of the New York Community Bank provides a recent example.) Once risk is priced and opacity is partly removed, even government protection is not likely to bring back a bank’s lost charter value (at least in the short term). Equally important is that news of large, sophisticated investments in banks often has a muted price impact. While blockholders have invested in weak banks, their presence is uncommon, and their impact is inconsequential. This is contrary to the view that, to protect their stake, large investors could be effective monitors and might exert pressure on management in poorly performing firms and influence firm corporate policies (see Shleifer and Vishny, 1986).[7] Yet, investors have little influence on corporate restructuring and other bank policies, particularly during a crisis period. The focus of corporate restructuring is often about assets, capital structure, and labor, approaches which are not mutually exclusive. Any change in these methods, particularly in acquisition and disposition of assets, takes time and could require regulatory approval (see Adams and Mehran, 2003).[8] Potential acquirers are likely to opt out if they think that they might face regulatory opposition on quick asset restructuring. Blockholders also are less willing to invest in a share of a bank if they cannot get a fair assessment of the value of the company. The loss-sharing agreement of failed banks between acquirers and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) supports this argument (see Bennett and Unal, 2014).[9] Bank valuation is hardly accurate as risk often is not effectively priced. Remaining unclear is whether regulators are aware of bank weak spots and, if they are, whether they would undertake corrective actions [see (Gallemore, 2016)[10] and (Mehran and Spatt, 2024)[11]]. Thus, the nature of bank assets and the role of regulation and supervision imply that very few blockholders invest in banks and attempt to turn around banking firms while they are in difficulty. The implication is that market discipline in banks would not benefit from the presence of sophisticated activist investors, unlike for non-financial companies (see Haubrich and Thomson, 1998).[12] Another regulatory hurdle might seem to weaken the ability of blockholders and activist investors to control the banking firm’s operation. The reason was noted in the Tisch family disclosure: The purpose behind acquiring a large block of shares in the banks was purely for investment and not for control. The statement of purpose for investment was intentional as the banking rule at the time prohibited investments of more than 5 percent if the intent were to control the bank. Also, blockholders were required to contact the Federal Reserve Board for any additional investments beyond 5 percent. Investment beyond 5 percent with control intent effectively invites supervision of the investors by the Federal Reserve. Allowing regulators to examine investors’ financial data and being subject to supervision arguably is a big deterrent to becoming a large blockholder in a bank, particularly when it might be difficult to prove the intent as discussed later. The cutoff, while set arbitrarily, was intended to ensure the stability of bank operations in the presence of activist investors. Ensuring operational stability and preventing potential abuse through ownership control is also an issue in other settings, as when thrift institutions convert from mutual to stock ownership (see Cole and Mehran, 1998).[13] Thus, blockholders’ ability and incentive to pressure management is limited, and the reward from doing so might be insufficient partly due to the banking rule on control. The 5 percent cutoff could be considered small, if investors’ desire to redirect the bank’s strategic direction or force out the management team. The Federal Reserve Board changed the cutoff to 10 percent on January 30, 2020.[14] The objective was to improve the flow of investment in bank equity and thus enhance banking firms’ capital. In the same spirit, following the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC allowed private equity firms to invest in equity of distressed banks (see Ross, et al., 2021).[15] Overall, which group of banks, large versus small, is most likely to be affected by the control rule, if at all, is unclear. To study the market assessment of lifting the ownership cutoff to 10 percent, we conducted an event study. An announcement effect was estimated for listed banks from March 29 to March 30, 2020. Five groups were created based on bank book-asset size at the end of the last quarter of 2019, and announcement returns were calculated for banks in each group. If weaker banks were insulated from market discipline, lifting the control threshold to 10 percent would make it easier for activists to influence governance of banks, and the gain would likely to be captured in equity prices. The announcement effect for the three groups with the largest book-assets is significant and positive, while banks in the two small asset groups suffered losses. Explaining the findings is difficult, particularly in the case of small banks. If the rise in the cutoff would have increased the likelihood of acquisition of small banks, then their stock price should have increased due to the present value of the acquisition premium. The loss then could be the result of interference on bank operations by future activist investors. The gain to large banks is likely due to potential merger and acquisitions and new investments in bank equity. Although there are reports of block acquisitions in small and community banks since the 2020 relaxation of the control role, there is little evidence of significant share acquisitions of large banks. Also, while 217 instances of activism were reported between 2019 and 2024, only a few large institutions were a target, such as Bank of America, Bank of New York Mellon Corporation, and State Street. Bank of America agreed to some minor changes in its governance. The other institutions are in effect custodians with very little commercial banking activities, and they agreed to some cost cutting (see for example, Benoit, 2014).[16] Activist investors have little influence in large banks in Europe as well (see Sweney and Makortoff, 2021).[17] Overall, most activist investors have targeted small and community banks (see Graf, 2023).[18] As expected, most of the demands of activist investors are for changes in governance rather than operations of banks (see Graf and Clark, 2024).[19] Thus, in light of the influence of regulators and supervisors on bank governance, the potential impact of activist investors on bank performance and stability is likely limited. This is not the case for activist investors in non-financial firms (see Gow, et al. (2023).[20] Thus, activist investors in banking probably are just as uninformed about their ability to influence bank governance as they are about the potential for windfall gains in distressed bank stocks, at least in the short term. The takeaway is that regulation and supervision are the most likely reasons that large investors are unable to influence bank operations. Institutional investors hold most of banks’ equity, and the trend is continuing. For example, at the end of 2024, institutions held about 76 percent of the shares of large banks in the U.S., and the percentage is higher for the largest commercial banks. Among the largest holders are BlackRock and Vanguard, which hold large blocks of shares in major banks, such as JPMorgan Chase. Vanguard held 9.74 percent, and BlackRock 6.89 percent at the end of 2024, according to a 2025 proxy filing with SEC. Both institutions held more than the control threshold of 5 percent in the bank at the end of 2019. While below the 10 percent threshold, these holdings raised concerns among regulators about the potential influence of large institutional investors to control and thus direct bank governance in ways that might be anticompetitive or even adversely affect the goal of financial stability. The FDIC, for example, reached an agreement with Vanguard on investment passivity last year.[21] The consequences of high institutional ownership on bank conduct are complex. Institutional ownership induces common ownership. While common ownership is considered very large in the banking industry, there is no evidence that it is anticompetitive (see Gramlich and Grundl, 2020).[22] Further, the evidence suggesting that institutional holdings induce anticompetitive behavior outside the financial industry is inconclusive (see Gerardi, et al., 2023).[23] Thus, much more work on the topic in the banking sector might be needed to draw public policy lessons. For example, common ownership has been shown to prompt more disclosure by non-financial firms (see Park et al., 2019).[24] But, it is unlikely to enhance more disclosure by banking firms for a number of reasons: presence of a significant amount of soft information in banks, proprietary nature of borrower information (see Bhattacharya-Chiesa, 1995),[25] risk sharing (see Dang et al., 2025),[26] and reluctance of banks to disclose any information without knowing how it would be perceived by supervisors and regulators. A potential area of financial stability concerns that has not received attention by regulators and academics is concentration of holdings of bank credit by institutional investors (see Mehran and Mollineaux, 2012).[27] How institutions would manage their bank credit holdings is an important financial stability issue, particularly in a crisis period. To our knowledge, this issue has not been studied by regulators. To underscore the benefit of effective banking activism on financial stability, we also focus on banks rather than investors. Due to weak economic conditions in New England following the S&L crisis, the Bank of Boston (established in 1784) and Baybank were forced to merge in 1996 to operate more effectively. The new entity, BankBoston, was acquired in 1999 by FleetBoston Financial. That, too, was absorbed, by Bank of America in 1999, an entity that exists today due to the financial protection of the U.S. taxpayers because of its size. Thus, when activism does not exist or has little impact in the banking industry, particularly in a crisis period, the control market could function as a substitute. However, the control market produces bigger institutions with larger supervisory challenges, a result that is also favored by regulators and supervisors as it transfers the assets of weaker institutions to stronger banks, thus lowering potential cost of the FDIC fund in the short term (see Prescott (2024) for an example).[28] However, larger institutions impose a higher cost on the economy in the event of their failure. Thus, fostering effective activism could reduce the extreme events that increasingly seem routine. Regulation and supervision have weakened the influence of activist investors and blockholders on bank governance and conduct as well as on financial stability. Further, no evidence yet exists that an increase in the permitted level of block ownership from 5 percent to 10 percent has had any measurable impact on bank conduct. While more activism has been evident in the past five years, instances were not likely to be related to changes in 2020 control ownership, as a similar trend existed outside financial firms. Moreover, increased activism in the banking sector was mostly targeted at smaller institutions and with no clear evidence of having made banks more valuable or healthier. Arguably, activism and block ownership are critical to the functioning of the U.S. capital market and businesses. But bank supervision and regulation have made these tactics ineffective. More disclosure and more timely disclosure by regulators could lift the imposed opacity and could make activism more vibrant (see Mehran and Spatt, 2024). This post comes to us from Hamid Mehran, a financial economist, and Chester Spatt, the Pamela R. and Kenneth B. Dunn Professor of Finance at Carnegie Mellon’s Tepper School of Business.

Media startup Minute Media, backed by BlackRock BLK and Goldman Sachs GS is betting big on that trend with its Sept. 9 acquisition of VideoVerse, an Indian AI company valued between $200 million and $250 million. The deal gives Minute Media, owner of sports content brands The Players' Tribune, Sports Illustrated, and 90 Minutes, access to technology that automatically extracts highlights and builds content packages from live sports footage. According to TechCrunch, VideoVerse's platform already works with the Indian Premier League, Women's Premier League Cricket, FIFA+, Nippon TV, and Cubber TV. Don't Miss: Founded in Mumbai in 2016 by Vinayak Shrivastav, VideoVerse initially built AI tools for industries outside sports. One early product flagged smoking and drinking scenes for India's film certification board, while another identified objects for e-commerce platforms. Shrivastav said that the turning point came in 2016 when Hotstar, now owned by Jio, sought solutions to detect action points in cricket matches. "In 2016, Hotstar [which is now owned by Jio] was growing, and they were looking for a solution that could identify certain action points in sports and primarily in cricket," Shrivastav told TechCrunch. Over time, the company abandoned its other projects and focused entirely on AI tools for sports broadcasters. VideoVerse now operates as a software-as-a-service platform, charging clients based on the hours of footage processed. Trending: ‘Scrolling To UBI' — Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones. You can invest today for just $0.30/share. The company has grown to $65 million in revenue with earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization margins between 35% and 40%, according to TechCrunch. VideoVerse Chief Strategy Officer Prateek Sharma told TechCrunch that the company has launched new AI tools that enable clients to define custom highlight rules. For example, a broadcaster can create automated clips of every three-pointer made by a specific player in a basketball game and instantly publish them to social media, TechCrunch reported. The platform also added AI-powered translation features to help leagues and broadcasters expand global fan engagement. While some processes incorporate third-party models, Sharma said VideoVerse relies on its proprietary model to identify the most important moments in matches. See Also: Kevin O'Leary Says Real Estate's Been a Smart Bet for 200 Years — This Platform Lets Anyone Tap Into It Minute Media CEO Asaf Peled told TechCrunch that the acquisition is the largest in the company's history in terms of both size and value. Minute Media has raised $260 million, reaches more than 200 million monthly users, and supports nearly 500 publishers through its business-to-business content distribution platform. "With the VideoVerse acquisition, we can go to customers and pitch the AI suite, which is helpful for content creation. Then we can add our distribution and monetization capabilities on top of it to get more value out of the content," Peled said. Peled added that the company wants to target U.S.-based leagues with VideoVerse's tools to meet rising demand for highlight-driven mobile sports coverage. Reports, like an IBM study, indicate that sports fans are consuming games differently. While the company is not currently raising capital, Peled said it may look to secure additional funding in the coming quarters to pursue further acquisitions.
