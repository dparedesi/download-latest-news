XRP has entered a new phase in its growth as Spot XRP ETFs begin trading across the United States. The excitement surrounding institutional access to XRP has grown quickly in recent weeks, especially as filings and inflow reports hint at rising interest from funds preparing to scale their exposure. A market commentator known as Chad Steingraber presented a projection showing just how intense ETF accumulation could become if issuers adopt an acquisition strategy similar to what was seen in Bitcoin ETFs. The estimates outline an aggressive period of accumulation that could reduce XRP’s available supply far faster than many expect, and here are the numbers. Steingraber’s first scenario examines a modest but steady accumulation model where 12 Spot XRP ETF issuers acquire an average of 3million XRP per day. His projection is based on focusing on the average rather than trying to predict which fund accumulates the most, because the combined impact is what ultimately matters for XRP’s market price. Under this setup, daily inflows would reach up to 36 million XRP. Over a standard five-day trading week, that accumulation would climb to 160 million XRP. Over the course of a month, the amount absorbed by ETFs would increase to 720 million XRP. By the end of a full year, this single projection implies that as much as 8.64 billion XRP could be removed from public circulation and locked into ETFs. Of course, these numbers only take into account the possibility of consecutive net inflow days and no net outflow days. Although these figures are hypothetical, the pace aligns with the early patterns seen in Bitcoin ETFs, where strong averages across issuers created a sustained demand for Bitcoin. In another post, Steingraber offered a more forceful accumulation model using the activity of Bitwise’s Spot XRP ETF as a benchmark. Data shows that the Bitwise XRP ETF received inflows of about 5.82 million XRP in its first trading day. In this second scenario, the projected daily acquisition rate is doubled to about 6 million XRP per issuer. If 12 funds follow this pattern, the combined accumulation could hit 72 million XRP every day. Extending the same five-day cycle, the weekly total would rise toward 360 million XRP, while monthly totals would reach approximately 1.44 billion XRP. Over a full year, this more aggressive model ends with 17.28 billion XRP absorbed into ETF products. “The entire XRP public supply will be gone UNLESS THE PRICE GOES ASTRONOMICALLY HIGH,” Steingraber said. The projections serve as a wake-up call on how quickly XRP’s supply ecosystem might change once ETF inflows stabilize and larger issuers like Grayscale, Bitwise, Canary, CoinShares, Franklin, 21Shares and WisdomTree get in on the action. However, BlackRock, which oversees the largest Spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, is yet to make any move on a Spot XRP ETF. The company had confirmed in August that it has no immediate plans to file for one.

Title: Financial advisors who ignore Bitcoin ditched by young wealthy Americans

The Great Wealth Transfer has a new filter test for advisors: if you don’t speak crypto, you don’t get the account. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Younger, wealthier Americans seem to be rewriting the house rules of wealth management. They like broad equity indices. They park cash in T-bills. They still buy real estate and private deals. But they also expect to see Bitcoin, Ethereum, and a handful of other digital assets on the same dashboard as everything else. For them, crypto is a normal slice of a portfolio. For many of their advisors, though, it’s still a compliance headache and a career risk. That gap between young investors and advisors is there, and it’s getting wider every day. Zerohash’s new “Crypto and the Future of Wealth” report surveyed 500 investors aged 18–40 in the US with household incomes ranging from $100,000 to over $1 million. Most of them already work with a financial advisor or private wealth manager. Yet when it comes to crypto, a big chunk runs a separate stack of apps, exchanges, and wallets because their advisory firm either can’t or won’t touch it. Tens of trillions will flow from older Americans to younger heirs and charities over the next two decades. The people set to receive that capital already treat a 5–20% crypto allocation as usual, and they’re now benchmarking advisors on whether they can underwrite that reality without blowing up fiduciary duty, tax planning, or basic cybersecurity. The decision younger wealthy clients have to make is simple: if you won’t manage the part of my portfolio I care most about, I’ll find someone who will. The numbers from Zerohash’s survey are blunt: around 61% percent of affluent 18–40-year-olds already hold crypto. That share climbs to 69% among the highest earners in the sample, and most don’t see crypto as a fun lottery. Among high-income investors, 58% put 11–20% of their portfolios into digital assets. For all of them, crypto sits in the same mental bucket as real estate and core equity funds, not as a side bet. The study notes that 43% of young investors allocate 5–10% of their portfolios to crypto, 27% allocate 11–20%, and 11% allocate more than 20%. Zerohash also adds that 84% of crypto holders plan to increase those allocations over the next year. Those are the numbers for the demand side. On the supply side, the advisory channel is basically a ghost town. The survey showed 76% of crypto holders invest independently, outside their brokerage or wealth management firm. Only 24% hold crypto through an advisor at all. These are not your BTC maximalists living in cold storage; these are people who already pay a basis-point fee for advice and still feel they have to run a separate portfolio in another browser tab. Their money is already moving, as 35% percent of all affluent investors in the sample say they have shifted assets away from advisors who do not offer crypto. Among the top-earning group on $500,000 to over $1 million, that share jumps to 51%. More than half of those who left moved between $250,000 and $1 million per head. And yet, the same dataset shows how easy it would be for wealth managers to keep these clients. About 64% of respondents say they would stay with an advisor longer or bring more assets across if that advisor provided crypto access; 63% say they would feel more comfortable investing through an advisor if digital assets sat on the same portfolio dashboard as their stocks and bonds. The main takeaway is that the bar for advisors is very, very low. The bar isn’t “become a crypto hedge fund,” but “recognize this asset class exists and can be held inside the same reporting stack.” Layer this on top of the Great Wealth Transfer, and the stakes get very large, very fast. Cerulli and RBC estimate that total wealth moving from older Americans to younger generations and charities will be in the $84–$124 trillion range through the 2040s. That wall of inheritance and business proceeds is drifting toward cohorts who already treat crypto as a regular part of their portfolio. If the demand is this clear, why do so many advisors still default to “we can’t touch that”? Part of the answer sits in product design. For a long time, the only way an advisory firm could get crypto exposure into a model portfolio was through weird closed-end funds, trust structures, or offshore vehicles nobody wanted to explain in a compliance exam. Even now, with spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs out in the wild, many RIAs and broker-dealers treat those tickers as curiosities. Then there is the paperwork. Investment Policy Statements written in the past 10 years often lump Bitcoin into “prohibited speculative instruments” alongside penny stocks and options. Changing that language takes committee meetings, E&O reviews, and legal memos. The path of least resistance for a mid-level compliance officer is usually to write “not approved at this time.” Underneath that sits custody law. Under SEC rules, registered advisers need to hold client funds and securities with a “qualified custodian,” which usually means a bank, broker-dealer, or similar institution that meets strict safeguards. For years, crypto didn’t fit neatly into those boxes, and the coveted SAB 121 (Staff Accounting Bulletin 121) made life even more complicated by forcing public banks that held digital assets to record matching liabilities on their balance sheets. That logjam has started to clear. In early 2025, the SEC rolled out new guidance and no-action relief that made it easier for state-chartered trust companies to serve as qualified crypto custodians, effectively retiring SAB 121. The regulatory stack might still look like uncharted waters for many, but it no longer treats digital assets as radioactive waste. However, on the ground, a new cast of partners is rushing into the gap. Fidelity Crypto for Wealth Managers offers custody and trade execution through Fidelity Digital Assets, wired directly into the same Wealthscape interface that an RIA already uses for stocks and bonds. Eaglebrook Advisors runs model portfolios and SMAs focused on BTC and ETH for wealth managers, with portfolio reporting and billing wired into standard RIA systems. BitGo has built a platform aimed at wealth management that ties qualified custody to a TAMP-style overlay. Anchorage Digital pitches itself as a regulated digital asset custodian with reporting, reconciliation, and governance controls explicitly designed for RIAs. On paper, a mid-sized advisory shop could now bolt on a crypto sleeve with partners it already recognizes from the institutional world. But in practice, the pipes inside many firms are still stuck in the last cycle. OMS and PMS systems do not always know what to do with staking yield. The billing logic struggles with on-chain positions. The structural gap shows up in the Zerohash numbers around behavior: 76% of crypto holders in the survey buy and manage their digital assets independently. That means they already know how to move funds through exchanges, hardware wallets, and on-chain apps. For that cohort, advisors become essentially useless for buying Bitcoin, Ethereum, or any other number of coins ranging from XRP to DOGE. Their value lies in tax, estate, and risk engineering for something the client has already done. This is where the “crypto-competent advisor” idea matters. A serious under-40 client today doesn’t care if their advisor can quote the Nakamoto consensus section of the Bitcoin whitepaper. They care about whether that advisor can: None of that is science fiction anymore. It’s just regular old financial advisor work. And it’s work that younger, wealthier investors have begun using as a scorecard. Zerohash’s survey shows a slow-motion run on legacy investment platforms. Start with the top-line: 35% of affluent investors in the 18–40 bracket have already moved assets away from advisors who do not provide crypto access. Among the highest-earning slice, that share is 51%. More than half of those who left had household incomes between $250,000 and $1 million. Put that into revenue terms. A $750,000 account billed at 1% is $7,500 per year. Lose ten of those relationships because you cannot stomach a 5–10% Bitcoin sleeve, and you have burned through the equivalent of a junior advisor’s salary. Lose fifty and you are into “we used to have an office in that city” territory. The path usually looks something like this: First, the client opens a self-directed account or a mobile app to get exposure while their advisor waffles. They buy the spot BTC ETF or a mix of coins on a mainstream exchange. Then, as that bucket grows and starts to feel real, they go shopping for someone who can treat it as part of a serious balance sheet. Crypto-focused RIAs and multi-family offices have picked up that brief, from DAiM in California to new arms like Abra Capital Management. Along the way, TikTok, YouTube, and Discord serve as the new discovery layer. A creator walks through how they run a 60/30/10 portfolio with T-bills, index ETFs, and a BTC/ETH sleeve. A podcast brings on a family office CIO who talks casually about budgeting 5% for digital assets. The message lands: if your advisor cannot even discuss this, others will. Culture becomes distribution. The golden aura around mahogany offices, golf club memberships, and brand-name wirehouses sits alongside a screen showing real-time P&L for a Coinbase or Binance account. For clients under 40, trust is starting to look like proof-of-reserves, qualified custody, hardware wallets, 2FA, and the ability to see everything in one portal, not just a logo they grew up seeing on CNBC. The Zerohash survey backs this up: 82% percent of respondents say that moves by names like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Morgan Stanley into digital assets make them more at ease with crypto in advisory portfolios. This is brand halo used in a new way: not to sell the firm’s own stock-picking skill, but to validate a new asset class they already hold. The portfolio design underneath all this is boring in the best way. Most affluent young investors in the survey sit inside a barbell: treasuries and broad indices on one side, a 5–20% crypto sleeve on the other, and some private deals or real estate sprinkled in between. They are not trying to reinvent modern portfolio theory. They are just adding one more risk bucket, then asking why the person who manages everything else in their life cannot help them manage this one. On the policy side, it lists Bitcoin and Ethereum as permitted assets in the IPS, subject to a defined cap, with clear language on liquidity events, rebalancing bands, and concentration limits. On the product side, it offers a simple menu: spot ETFs for clients who care about convenience and easy tax reporting; direct coins with institutional custody for those who want on-chain access; minimal alt exposure, if any, and only in products that clear compliance checks. On the operations side, it chooses partners who plug into existing reporting and billing systems: perhaps Fidelity Crypto for custody and execution, Eaglebrook or Bitwise strategies inside model portfolios, Anchorage or BitGo for more advanced clients who need governance features and staking. And it works on cybersecurity: how to talk about hardware wallets, key backups, SIM-swap risk, and what happens if a client loses access. On the human side, it stops treating crypto questions as a nuisance and starts treating them as an early warning system. The client who quietly moves $500,000 to a self-directed platform because you refused even to discuss Bitcoin is telling you something. Not necessarily anything about their risk tolerance, but a lot about how replaceable they think you are. All of this sits atop that $80-plus trillion to $120-plus trillion wall of wealth slated to move from boomers to their heirs over the next two decades. The inheritors of that capital grew up in a world where spending and sending feel as normal as wiring a bank transfer, and they’re busy watching which advisors respect that reality. The window is open for Wall Street, but it will not stay open forever. The first wave of crypto-competent RIAs, family offices, and fintech platforms is already laying the groundwork for weaving Bitcoin and digital assets into plain-vanilla wealth management without blowing up fiduciary duty, tax planning, or cybersecurity. Everyone else can keep arguing about whether a 5–10% crypto sleeve belongs in a portfolio while their clients quietly walk their accounts out the door. The wealth transfer is happening either way.

Celebrated for dressing Princess Diana and creating the uniforms of British Airways staff, Paul Costelloe rose to become one of Ireland’s most successful fashion designers. In Ireland he has been associated with Dunnes Stores for the past 20 years for his collections of homewares, menswear and womenswear, a collaboration recently celebrated at his home in Monkstown. Following in the wake of Sybil Connolly who was the first to give Irish fashion an international profile, he established his name in Dublin as a young designer in 1979 having trained at the Grafton Academy followed by a period in Paris and Milan. His tailoring and early use of Donegal tweed and Irish linen made his name – breezy early dresses in the 1980s made from handkerchief linen were a sensation. That mix of tailoring and what is called flou with a strong colour sense continued to mark his style throughout his career along with a nostalgia for the freedom of the 1960s. He was also a gifted painter. Easygoing, low-key but disciplined were words used to describe his clothes, which could also accurately describe his personality. Forthright in his opinions which often generated controversy, he had a healthy disrespect for the rhetoric and hype surrounding the industry. His candour and lack of pretension made him popular with the British press. His real break came in London in 1983/84 when he was accepted as a member of a select group of British designers called the London Designer Collection, where he showed in London for the first time. That later became London Fashion Week, where he has shown for the past 40 years, most recently in the Waldorf Astoria ballroom where his collections were always the first on the schedule marking the opening of the week. The youngest of seven children of Willie Costelloe, a raincoat manufacturer who was the son of a Limerick publican and a member of the old IRA, his mother Catherine Curran was an American from New York. Paul grew up with a stylish mother and four sisters which certainly had an influence on him. Educated in Willow Park and Blackrock College, after leaving school he spent a year at the Grafton Academy before heading to Paris and a job with Jacques Esterel, the avant-garde French fashion designer. From Paris, he went to Milan, working at the department store La Rinascente. Then he took off for New York, which he recalled as the toughest part of his career, before returning to Ireland and setting up in business. His couture collections in London, shown twice yearly, demonstrated the freedom to design without commercial constraint as the clothes were only made to order and not produced for ready-to-wear sale. His last show, for winter 2025, was staged in Dublin’s City Hall in September, but he was unable to attend due to illness. He is survived by his wife Anne (née Cooper) and their seven children, Robert, Gavin, Justin, Paul Emmet, William, Nicholas and daughter Jessica. His son William, an artist like his father, has been increasingly involved in the business, as has his daughter Jessica, who is also a trained opera singer.

Title: Crypto CEO Says Bitcoin Was Never Meant To Be ‘Digital Gold’ – So What Is It?
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-ceo-says-bitcoin-was-never-meant-to-be-digital-gold-so-what-is-it/
Time Published: 2025-11-22T17:00:29Z

A terse but provocative message by crypto CEO Jacob King has challenged the prevailing narrative around Bitcoin at a time when the asset’s price has reversed much of its 2025 gains. King contends that Bitcoin was never intended to function as a store of value or inflation hedge, two big labels widely used to describe Bitcoin in the past few years. Bitcoin’s price decline in recent weeks has revived long-standing questions about what the cryptocurrency was meant to represent. Much of the price surge earlier in the year has now been erased, and sentiment across the market has shifted into a defensive posture. In light of this, Jacob King released a pointed critique challenging the main arguments that investors have attached to Bitcoin over the past decade. King grounds his argument in the language of the Bitcoin whitepaper, which describes a peer-to-peer electronic cash system designed to facilitate direct online payments without intermediaries. He stresses that the whitepaper never discussed Bitcoin as a store of value, an inflation hedge, a geopolitical refuge, or any of the traits that dominate modern discourse. In King’s view, high fees, limited throughput, and declining real-world use pushed supporters to adopt new perspectives that kept enthusiasm alive, even if those narratives had no connection to what Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin’s creator, outlined in 2008. Satoshi explicitly described Bitcoin as a peer-to-peer system for online payments. The idea of Bitcoin as a form of digital gold was manufactured by maximalists to attract fresh waves of retail buyers. King’s comments land at a moment when Bitcoin’s price action is playing out anything but stability. The leading cryptocurrency has dropped massively from its 2025 highs, reversing most of the year’s gains and sending shockwaves through the broader market. The decline led to liquidations, weakened sentiment across major altcoins, and raised new doubts about Bitcoin’s defensive qualities during periods of stress. King’s view on Bitcoin clashes directly with the views of some of the most influential voices in global finance. Michael Saylor has repeatedly described Bitcoin as the superior successor to gold, calling it “digital property.” Larry Fink of BlackRock took the idea mainstream when he said Bitcoin had become a hedge to overcome and address local fears, a phrase that suggested the asset was maturing into a global store of value. Tom Lee, Head of Research at Fundstrat Global, has also embraced this viewpoint, stating that Bitcoin’s valuation could climb to the $200,000 to $250,000 range if it manages to capture 25% of gold’s market share. Earlier this year, Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell echoed similar sentiment, noting that Bitcoin now acts as a legitimate competitor to gold. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $84,130. Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: Tributes paid to Cork mother Stella Gallagher as funeral arrangements announced

Tributes have been paid to mother-of-four Stella Gallagher who died following a fatal stabbing incident in Cork earlier this week. Details of her funeral arrangements have been announced for early next week. Ms Gallagher (59) and her husband Brian (63) were both injured in the attack near their home in Shrewsbury Downs, Ballinlough at around 9pm on Monday night. Both were rushed by ambulance to Cork University Hospital where Ms Gallagher later died. Mr Gallagher underwent emergency surgery for a number of knife wounds including a serious wound to his neckand he spent several days recuperating at CUH before he was discharged from the hospital. He is now recovering with his family. The couple regularly attended Togher Community Garden in Cork with their son David since their retirement. Togher Community Garden is a volunteer-led non-profit community garden in Cork with support from Green Spaces for Health and Cork City Council. Gardeners grow their own fruit and vegetables there. Paying tribute to Ms Gallagher in an online statement, the group said: “It is with profound sadness that we share the news of the passing of our dear friend and fellow gardener, Stella. “Stella was a cherished and invaluable friend to us all in the Togher Community Garden family. Her absence will be deeply felt by everyone here. We especially remember her beautiful smile and the gentle person she was to everyone she met. Our garden will always hold memories of her kindness.” Ms Gallagher was also a member of the Cork Social Health Project (Shep) Choir. Its director, Jim Sheehan, said she was “much loved and greatly missed” in a message of sympathy posted on rip.ie “Stella was a member of the Shep Choir since the very beginning and loved being part of that community,” he said. “She was a very gentle and caring presence in the choir and brought much joy to others through her singing and camaraderie. She recognised the power and comfort of singing with others.” A native of Ballinspittle in west Cork, Ms Gallagher qualified as a chemical engineer with a BSc from Cork Institute of Technology, now Munster Technological University, in the 1980s. She worked for US pharmaceutical giant Lilly at its plant in Dunderrow near Kinsale for over three decades. “Stella was a long-standing employee at Lilly Kinsale for over 30 years, and she retired from the company in 2023.

Title: Turning ‘$11K to Half a Billion Dollars From Trading Memecoins’: Tales From a Crypto Wealth Manager

Jake Claver, CEO of Digital Ascension Group, a firm that helps wealthy individuals and their families navigate the world of cryptocurrency, recalls how one of his clients, “a gentleman from Dallas,” turned $11,000 into almost half a billion dollars, primarily from trading memecoins – culturally themed crypto tokens with no real utility whose valuations can fluctuate wildly. The lucky investor, whom Claver got to know first as a friend, managed his own crypto. “He used a sniper bot [automated software that will buy and sell newly listed tokens in milliseconds according to certain parameters] that made him millions from memecoin trading,” Claver said. Eventually, Claver persuaded his friend to attend one of the registered investment adviser's (RIA) family office events, which led to a portion of the trader’s portfolio being rolled into XRP, the well-established native token of the Ripple network. “We saw a 6x on XRP so he did pretty well,” Claver said. Several years before, Claver found himself searching for advice on managing his own crypto gains. Specifically, he wanted to explore how best to structure his crypto estate, handle his taxes, carry out succession planning and so on. But none of the typical wealth advice you find in the traditional high net worth (HNW) space seemed to be available for holders of crypto. After a few useful introductions, Claver consulted with some family offices and saw a glaring advisory gap in the market. This led to the formation of Digital Ascension, and from a standing start, the firm now looks after about $1 billion in crypto assets for wealthy families. “Asension started taking capital in October last year, and we partnered with Anchorage for institutional custody,” Claver said in an interview. “So, we’ve gone from zero to a billion in all crypto in about one year. We work with 10families, and we have about another 1,500 clients that have somewhere between half a million and 5 million in total portfolio value. And I can confidently say we are the largest RIA in the world for crypto.” Ascension takes any private client services that you can think of, and does that for crypto, explained Claver. That includes estate planning, taxes, accounting, bill-pay and everything a family office would provide. This sits alongside wealth management, which includes allocating to various cryptocurrencies, setting up lines of credit and earning returns on assets, but all done in a buttoned-up and regulated fashion – “Not through DeFi [decentralized finance],” Claver said. “We do it with institutional custody and with insurance on your assets and things like tri-party agreements to mitigate risk of loss,” he said. “It’s very different from the kind of onchain stuff. You can get all the additional assurances you would get from an institution with the benefit of the additional services.” A crucial component here is custody, courtesy of technology built by Anchorage, one of the first U.S.-regulated crypto safekeeping firms. It was recently selected by BlackRock to look after its crypto ETF assets. “The institutional custody at Anchorage and sub accounts structure means the client is never a creditor,” Claver said. “These are always your assets. They sit in your account. Effectively, a Schwab account for your crypto is basically what it ends up being.” This allows for a structure that’s a lot more intricate and nuanced than a few people having keys to some cold wallet (a means of holding crypto assets that stays remote from the harsh winds of the internet). “You can have beneficiaries on the account such as your spouse,” Claver said. “If you have a trustee that has to sign off — say it’s an asset-protection trust or another type of structure — we can add multiple signers and governance on who gets access to the assets, when, and for what reasons.” Trading crypto assets prone to periods of intense volatility may not be for the fainthearted, but the industry has amassed monumental wealth for investors in recent years and continues to create more wealthy individuals in each cycle. The global population of crypto millionaires increased by 40% from the previous year to 2025, according to a recent study. That said, the lack of grown-up advice and basic crypto wealth management — which Ascension is servicing — was highlighted in a recent survey by Swiss software firm Avaloq that found the traditional wealth sector is under mounting pressure to deliver digital assets to wealthy clients. In the UAE, for instance, 63% of ultra-rich investors have switched managers or are considering doing so, according to that survey. What often happens is the children of ultra-high-net-worth families are the ones educating their elders about digital assets. A generation that grew up with crypto, family-office kids use laptops or phones to purchase large quantities of tokens on exchanges like Coinbase and Binance. It’s mostly second- or third-generation family office members that Ascension initially speaks with, Claver said, guided via his firm’s social media presence. The next step is to schedule a call with the elders. “It’s usually a conversation with the matriarch or patriarch and I kind of explain to them that this is the next iteration of the internet, and that there's certain protocols and networks that will be used for public infrastructure, and also how this is kind of a hedge against other positions that they might have,” he said. Oftentimes, the second or third gen person that's brought the conversation will be given a couple of million dollars to invest in digital assets to see how it works out. Most of the time it's somewhere less than 1%, Claver said. “If they want to make a large allocation to certain cryptos — bitcoin, Ethereum, SOL, Matic, chainlink, XRP, XLM, HBAR, whatever it is — we help them make that allocation. Or, if they already have those allocations in a cold wallet, and they don't have a continuity plan built around that, then they can put it in institutional custody. Then you get assurances and planning, versus having keys or words written down on a piece of paper that a few people might have and have to reconstitute a wallet every quarter to make adjustments.” Claver admits things have evolved since the early days of Bitcoin libertarians. Apart from anything else, the demographic of these early holders has changed, with many entering the 40-plus age group. And anyone’s perspective starts to change when they suddenly have a lot of capital to protect, he added. “If you've got a couple 100 grand, or even a couple million dollars, you may feel comfortable managing the risk associated with that, like cash in your mattress. I get that," Claver said. “But when it becomes $20, $50, $100 million or even a billion dollars, it's a very different animal.” More For You Protocol Research: GoPlus Security What to know: More For You Could Stablecoins Spark a New Contagion?

Title: Crypto Investors Are Now Value Investors, CryptoQuant CEO Reveals Why

© 2025 Coinspeaker LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju has pointed out a pivot from crypto speculation to value investing within the blockchain industry. Ki Young Ju, CEO of CryptoQuant, has made a post in X suggesting that the current cryptocurrency price dip masks a shift to value investing. He claimed that this new era is driven by Traditional Finance (TradFi) integration, like tokenized Real World Assets (RWAs). This comes as Bitcoin price falls to around $84,000 from its October peak of $126,000, and Ethereum (ETH) trades below $2,700. For the longest time, digital assets were synonymous with speculation, but CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju believes that the era is quietly coming to an end. On X, he claimed that the market is undergoing a necessary but under-appreciated transformation. In his words, “crypto investors are becoming value investors.” Young Ju pointed out that even as the prices are down, the fundamentals are the strongest they’ve been in the past seven years. In fact, he claims not to have seen fundamentals and price drift this far apart. crypto investors are now value investors https://t.co/oihgm3zh4i — Ki Young Ju (@ki_young_ju) November 22, 2025 Amid this outlook, there is more integration of TradFi with Decentralized Finance (DeFi). He cited the example of the former BlackRock IBIT team members who launched HelloTrade. Noteworthy, HelloTrade is a decentralized exchange that is designed for 24/7 trading of tokenized stocks and bonds. Robinhood is also inching towards tokenized private shares, as earlier announced by its CEO, Vlad Tenev. Then there is Strategy, the popular business intelligence and software firm that has made Bitcoin acquisition a hobby. CryptoQuant CEO noted that all of this development suggests that the TradFi system is building infrastructure for a new financial world. Globally, there is a strong movement of tokenization in the TradFi system, marking a revolutionary pivot. During the Hong Kong FinTech Week, held earlier in November, Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) Chief Executive Eddie Yue unveiled a five-year tokenization plan. He described it as a core pillar for advancing the city’s financial sector. The roadmap includes more than 40 initiatives across four areas: data infrastructure, Artificial Intelligence (AI), resilience, and tokenization of finance. Also, SEGG Media unveiled a $300 million digital asset strategy that combines an 80/20 crypto treasury model with validator income and tokenized sports assets.

Bitcoin ETFs pull in $238 million as Ether funds end an eight-day outflow streak and Solana products extend a ten-day run of inflows. Spot crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw a rebound at the end of the week, with all Bitcoin, Ether and Solana funds seeing inflows after a week of volatility and downturns. On Friday, spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs attracted $238.4 million in net inflows after a wave of heavy redemptions the day before. BlackRock’s IBIT drove the turnaround with $108 million, while smaller contributions from BITB, ARKB, and BTCO helped lift sentiment. Even Grayscale’s GBTC, long pressured by outflows, added $61.5 million, according to data from Farside Investors. The recovery came after a bruising $903 million outflow on Thursday, the biggest outflow day in November and one of the largest single-day outflows since the products were launched in January 2024. During the day, redemptions hit nearly every issuer, including IBIT with a loss of $355.5 million, FBTC with $190.4 million pulled, and GBTC with $199.4 million in outflows. Related: BlackRock Bitcoin ETF sheds $2.47B in November as outflows hit record $3.79B After eight consecutive sessions of redemptions, Ether (ETH) ETFs broke their losing streak with $55.7 million in inflows on Friday, powered largely by Fidelity’s FETH, which brought in $95.4 million. The reversal followed a punishing stretch from Nov. 11–20, when Ethereum funds shed a combined $1.28 billion, one of the longest and deepest red waves since their launch. Meanwhile, Solana (SOL) ETFs continue to outperform the broader altcoin market. Since launch, the five Solana funds have gathered $510 million in net inflows, led overwhelmingly by Bitwise’s BSOL with $444 million. The group has now logged a 10-day inflow streak.

Futures funding rates have risen from four percent to six percent, indicating early signs of stabilization even though bullish demand remains weak.

Title: 'We did it' - homecoming for man who swam round Ireland

Pat McGrath Western Correspondent A homecoming event has been held in Galway to celebrate the achievements of a man who has has completed a swim around the country's coastline. Daragh Morgan embarked on the fundraising effort over five months ago and completed his endeavour this week. It involved him covering around 15 kilometres each day, in order to circumnavigate a total distance of 1,468 kilometres. Organisers marked the completion of the swim with a homecoming event at Galway Harbour this afternoon. Homecoming for Daragh Morgan after his swim around Ireland Over the course of his journey, the 27-year-old was accompanied by a support fleet comprising three boats, with crews providing safety and navigational assistance when necessary. The primary support vessel was the Naomh Crónán, a 43ft Galway Hooker, provided by the Galway based Badóirí an Chladaigh group of seafarers. The expedition was captained by Dara Bailey, from Leitir Mór, and has raised over €27,000 for the RNLI and the Simon Community. "Only a select few people would be able to skipper that vessel and Dara was the glue that held everything together" said Mr Morgan. "He had so much to co-ordinate and organise all the way through this. Looking at tides, planning how we would get to GPS co-ordinates, taking to local fishermen and plotting the route". Since the start of the expedition at the end of May, Mr Morgan embarked on 99 separate swims, over 93 days. He first came up with the idea in 2019. "I was always into sport but I wanted to explore Ireland and dreamt up the idea from that notion. "But I hadn't done necessary training or anything, so I decided I needed to test my mind, body and soul to see if I could do this. "I did several swims, ran the length of Ireland and then the width of Ireland non-stop. All those things fed into the swimming idea and got me ready." He set off from Blackrock diving tower in Salthill last May, swimming first to Inis Mór. He then headed northwards, eventually travelling past 17 coastal counties, before returning to Galway this week. Over the course of his swims, he said he endured multiple jellyfish stings and other injuries, as well as contending with challenging weather conditions and unfavourable seas. "The hardest part was getting in the water to start off," said Mr Morgan. "The enormity of the logistics hit me then and I knew the scale of what I was about to undertake. "Then the usual challenges came up…chafing was a massive problem, I got badly injured and had to go to hospital at one stage, but we overcame everything to make a dream a reality." "I was very ambitious with it. I set myself a target of three months initially, to have a deadline to work towards. That put a bit of urgency to it and we ended up doing it in five months and seventeen days." "We logged our GPS co-ordinates everywhere we stopped and then started off again from there at the next stage of the journey." Organisers are emphasising the importance of a community-based effort to complete the task, in the absence of major corporate sponsorship. At the end of it all Mr Morgan said it was "pretty surreal and very emotional" to arrive back in Galway with his support crew. "We went through so much together and developed a very strong bond for each other and for the country as well. It gave me an immense sense of pride to be back in Galway, holding the Irish flag and to be able to say we did it". He is the second person to complete the feat, following the late Henry O'Donnell from Donegal, who undertook a similar challenge in 2022. Western Correspondent © RTÉ 2025.

Title: For the birds: alternative showstopper dishes for the Thanksgiving or Christmas table

As turkey farmers around the country grapple with the stress and potential monetary hit surrounding the spread of bird flu, supply uncertainty is also creeping into festive menus – is it really Christmas if we can’t rely on a gorgeous, golden bird resting at the centre of our tables? These five chefs would argue it most certainly can be, and who are we to disagree? Here, they offer up suggestions from their most beloved dishes to help get us through the coming celebrations, and there isn’t a hint of turkey in sight. I grew up in China, where we didn’t celebrate Christmas, so I haven’t got the same Christmas traditions that most people in this country would have. However, we always use it as an excuse to get together and celebrate with friends, and for many years now we have hosted this celebration in our house. We have about 15 people – friends and family – for a big meal on Christmas Day, for which I do all the cooking. I put lots of dishes filled with food on the table and let everyone help themselves. A lot of what I cook on Christmas Day is dictated by my family and the food that they love to eat. I cook a côte de boeuf every year as it’s always a huge hit, in particular with my 10-year-old daughter who would eat it all herself if allowed. I cook plenty of sides with it, both vegetables and potatoes. I definitely take a more relaxed approach at home than in the restaurant. My wife demands that I do her favourite – a butternut squash risotto; I don’t have a choice in the matter. My son is a big fan of fish and seafood, so there will have to be some prawns and a fillet of fish or two for him. We don’t really have desserts – I just put a selection of cheeses on the table and everyone helps themselves. Barry Sun’s non-turkey recommendations are: roasted butternut squash risotto with sage and taleggio, and côte de boeuf. Every year, I cook for 14 of my family who are all delighted to see something different on the menu, especially my teenage son, who loves venison. I started off serving melon and thinly sliced venison – our version of Parma ham and melon – which was a great crowd-pleaser in the Commons household. We then moved on to a lightly smoked venison as a starter, which I cured in gin and juniper berries and topped with a cranberry and hazelnut crumble. Now, for the main course, everyone is delighted to see the venison replace turkey. The big thing is that venison is wild, which gives it such a unique and herby flavour. Often you can taste the heather, unlike traditional turkey which can ultimately be very bland – hence all the sides that accompany it to maximise the flavour. Cooking venison is also a different concept. Work-wise, venison is easier to cook. Unlike turkey, where you have to cook it at a high temperature, then lower it and start the basting process, venison can be cooked on the pan exactly the way you like it, avoiding overcooking. Not only that, venison is the healthier option with a lower fat content. Sika deer is excellent; flavour-wise it really stands out, so if you can get your hands on that you’re in luck. Your butcher might be able to arrange some for you. Place venison, cracked juniper berries and rosemary in a bag and leave overnight. Remove from the bag and season. Seal off the venison in a hot pan until golden brown, add the gin and flambé. Place in preheated oven for eight minutes (medium). Remove from the oven and cover with tin foil. Allow to rest for three minutes Place the pears and the vanilla seeds and pod in a pot and cover with a lid. Cook slowly on a low heat until soft. Remove the vanilla pod. Place in a blender and blitz until smooth. Set aside and keep warm In a warm pot, melt the butter until lightly foaming. Add the shallot and thyme. Sweat until soft and translucent. Add the cabbage and cook until tender. Season with salt and add the truffle oil. Form into a ball shape and wrap in the outer leaves, then wrap the ball in cling film. Set aside. When reheating, place in boiling water for three minutes. Remove the cling film and place on the plate. (The cabbage ball can be cooked in advance and kept in the fridge.) We have never been a great house for the traditional Christmas Day turkey dinner. I always cook a very small turkey for visitors who call, but for our family dinner I will always try an alternative. Over the years, we have had goose, duck, beef Wellington and other dishes. This year, though, I decided to try stay away from the prime cuts and try some slow cooking. We have had a dish on in the restaurant – slow-cooked ribs – for the past few weeks and its moreish nature has inspired me to replicate it at home. Being a slow-cooking dish, it is easily prepared, can cook while I am at work, and when ready can be served with nearly all of the usual Christmas fare. It is fantastic with roasted parsnips, creamy champ and jus made from the cooking liquor. Garnish it with a sneaky slice of honey-glazed local ham. Beef Wellington makes a spectacular main course for Christmas Day dinner – it’s elegant, indulgent and guaranteed to impress. The golden, flaky pastry encasing tender beef fillet and rich mushrooms creates a show-stopping centrepiece that’s as beautiful to look at as it is delicious to eat. It’s perfect for serving a big crowd, slicing neatly to reveal its layers. Slicing it at the table offers a nice bit of theatre to guests too – it’s always a wow moment when we serve it in The Shelbourne too. Paired with classic sides such as crispy roast potatoes and seasonal vegetables, beef Wellington brings both comfort and luxury to the festive table. It’s a true crowd-pleaser that everyone in the family loves, making it a timeless favourite for a special Christmas feast. Christmas can be overwhelming with the amount of food and meat, so for me something like monkfish, which is light but has a meaty texture, is a really great alternative. Seasonal greens and those delicious buttery potatoes will complement it perfectly and leave you feeling very satisfied. Buy the freshest monkfish you can find, or any other white fish such as John Dory, halibut, hake, or cod – are all great options. Serve with cooked seasonal greens such as kale, chard or spinach, which all complement the dish beautifully. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

The slate of reforms under consideration could be the biggest positive development for our financial markets since the early days of the Reagan administration, if not since the creation of the federal securities laws themselves. It could also finally put the brakes on the rise of “woke capital.” For years, political activists have been using America’s biggest corporations as vehicles for their social agenda. They call it “ESG” — environmental, social and governance investing — but it really boils down to pressuring companies to take political stands that most ordinary investors never asked for, from Black Lives Matter to “climate justice.” The most famous example came in 2021, when a tiny “green” hedge fund named Engine No. 1 managed to get two climate-activist directors on the board of oil giant Exxon Mobil. How did political actors disguised as investors convince other shareholders to elect oil-hostile directors to the board of a petroleum company? Simple: They captured the votes of the massive passive index fund giants — BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street.

Title: Crypto Trader Who Correctly Predicted The Bitcoin price Top At $125,000 Reveals Where It’s Headed Next
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-price-top-at-125000/
Time Published: 2025-11-22T02:00:48Z
Full Content:
Bitcoin price action has shifted into a high-volatility zone, and a well-known crypto trader is reinforcing a bearish outlook that is unfolding almost exactly as he projected. Doctor Profit—who previously pinpointed the $68,000 peak in 2021 and this cycle’s $125,000 top—is now mapping out further downside, framing the current correction as only the first stage of a much deeper decline. Bitcoin price has entered a pronounced downward cycle, registering losses of 8.4% in the past 24 hours and more than 17% over the last two weeks. Doctor Profit noted on X (formerly Twitter) that Bitcoin’s drop from $125,000 marks the first stage of a larger bear-market trend. He frames the current environment as a transitional zone marked by brief consolidation rather than true stabilization. Under his model, the next major move points toward a deeper retracement, with the Bitcoin price ultimately gravitating toward the $60,000 region as the cycle’s next critical target. This call aligns with his historical cycle predictions. In earlier cycles, he anticipated the 2021 top near $68,000, projected a collapse toward $18,000, and then switched bullish at that bottom to forecast the rally toward $120,000. With the latest reversal forming directly at the levels he flagged months in advance, his bearish thesis has gained renewed credibility. He also pointed back to a September warning that the crypto market was set for a 30% contraction. With about 25% already wiped out, he views the downturn as a broad repricing rather than a simple correction. In a separate post, Doctor Profit highlights unusually large outflows from top asset managers, framing the activity as aggressive bearish positioning rather than panic. On-chain data supports this, as transfer logs show deep, continuous outflows from Grayscale-linked wallets into Coinbase Prime. These transactions include batches ranging from roughly 14 BTC to nearly 500 BTC per transfer, with multiple consecutive sends above $47 million each. The sequencing indicates coordinated offloading rather than isolated reallocations. Similarly, BlackRock’s IBIT vehicles executed a string of 300 BTC transfers repeatedly into the same exchange infrastructure, alongside other batches such as the 135.351 BTC movement captured in the logs. Each 300-BTC tranche reflects roughly $27–28 million in flow at recent prices. Analysts observing these flows reported that more than $3 billion in Bitcoin hit exchanges within just 45 minutes on November 20, one of the most aggressive sell-offs of the cycle. As institutional selling grows and his cycle model tracks prices closely, the market is adjusting expectations. Bitcoin could stay well above the next predicted levels, keeping attention on the path from $125,000 down to his $60,000 target. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: BTC ETF outflows are 'tactical rebalancing,' not institutional flight: Analysts

The outflows reflect short-term price movements, not lower institutional demand or structural issues in the Bitcoin market, analysts said. The record outflows from Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) represent short-term, “tactical” rebalancing rather than institutional flight from BTC, according to analysts at crypto exchange Bitfinex. Long-term Bitcoin (BTC) holders taking profit and selling their coins, and highly-leveraged positions flushing out of the markets, are the root causes of the billions of dollars in ETF outflows and the broader market crash, Bitfinex analysts said. The uncertainty of a December interest rate cut has also shifted investors to a risk-off outlook, Bitfinex said. Bitfinex said the structural thesis for Bitcoin remains “firm,” and that Bitcoin is positioned for continued institutional adoption as a store-of-value asset with strong long-term fundamentals. The ongoing drawdown is a short-term price movement, they added. Related: BlackRock leads near $3B Bitcoin November ETF exodus with record $523M outflows Bitcoin ETF outflows have topped $3.7 billion in November, as losses from October’s crypto market crash extended into the month, sparking investor fears of the beginning of a bear market. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) ETF led the outflows, with over $2.47 billion in redemptions so far in November. The Bitcoin ETFs posted some of the worst daily outflows on record in November. Single-day outflows crossed $900 million on Thursday, according to Farside Investors. The average ETF investor is now underwater following BTC’s crash below $90,000. However, this does not mean that ETF investors will panic sell, Vincent Liu, chief investment officer at quantitative trading company Kronos Research, told Cointelegraph. Bitcoin ETF investors tend to be long-term holders and ignore short-term market noise and price movements, Liu said. Long-term Bitcoin whales and OGs who hold the asset directly rather than through an investment vehicle are responsible for most of the selling, according to senior Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas.

Title: Bitcoin rout continues as crypto treasuries face reckoning: Finance Redefined

Growing unrealized losses and falling NAV levels are threatening corporate crypto treasuries, making it difficult to raise capital for future digital asset investments. Cryptocurrency markets continued their decline for a fourth consecutive week this week, raising concerns over the status of the bull market cycle. Investor concerns grew on Thursday after a 10X Research report revealed that BitMine Immersion Technologies, the world’s largest corporate Ether (ETH) holder, is sitting on a cumulative unrealized loss of $3.7 billion on its total holdings. Most digital asset treasuries (DATs) have suffered declines in their net asset value (NAV), making it difficult to raise funds for new investments or to attract new retail investors, leaving existing shareholders “trapped” with growing paper losses, according to 10x Research founder Markus Thiele DATs are also facing significant pressure from the MSCI stock market index, which is considering excluding corporate crypto treasuries with a balance sheet comprising more than 50% of crypto assets. The consultation is open until Dec. 31, with the results set to be made public on Jan. 15, 2026. The resulting changes will take effect in February. Elsewhere, Bitcoin (BTC) sank to a six-month low of $82,000 on Friday, a level last seen in April when the markets were recovering from US President Donald Trump’s Liberation Day tariff announcement, TradingView data shows. Concerns are mounting over the sustainability of corporate crypto-treasury firms as BlackRock moves forward with a staked Ether fund that analysts say could compete directly with existing digital-asset treasuries. BitMine Immersion Technologies, the world’s largest corporate Ether holder, is currently down $1,000 per purchased ETH, implying a cumulative unrealized loss of $3.7 billion on its total holdings, according to a Thursday research report from crypto insights company 10x Research. The decline in net asset value (NAV) across these firms is making it difficult to attract new retail investors while leaving many existing shareholders effectively “trapped” unless they sell at a steep loss, 10x Research founder Markus Thielen wrote in a LinkedIn post. “When the premium inevitably shrinks to zero, as it is doing now, investors find themselves trapped in the structure, unable to get out without significant damage, a true Hotel California scenario,” he said. He added that, unlike exchange-traded funds (ETFs), digital-asset treasury companies, or DATs, “layer on complex, opaque, and often hedge-fund-like fee structures that can quietly erode returns.” The mNAV ratio compares a company’s enterprise value to the value of its crypto holdings. An mNAV above 1 allows a company to raise funds by issuing new shares to accumulate digital assets. Values below 1 make it much harder to expand capital and holdings. BitMine’s basic mNAV stood at 0.77 while its diluted mNAV stood at 0.92, according to data from Bitminetracker. Continue reading The US Securities and Exchange Commission’s Crypto Task Force has scheduled a roundtable discussion centered on privacy and financial surveillance for December, as a renewed focus on privacy grips the cryptocurrency industry. The privacy roundtable is slated for Dec. 15. Like other SEC roundtables, crypto industry executives and SEC officials will discuss common pain points and solutions, but no hard policy proposals will be submitted. Privacy has become a hot-button topic following several developments, including the partial guilty verdict in Tornado Cash developer Roman Storm’s trial in June, the Samourai Wallet developer sentencing in November and the privacy token price rally over the last two months. “Authoritarians thrive when people have no privacy. When those in charge start being hostile to privacy protections, it is a major red flag,” said Naomi Brockwell, founder of the Ludlow Institute, an organization advocating for liberty through technology. The renewed interest in privacy hearkens back to crypto’s cypherpunk roots, and one of the core reasons the cryptographic technology that underpins crypto was invented — to ensure secure communication channels between parties in hostile environments. Continue reading Coinbase has launched Ether-backed loans for US users, allowing customers to borrow USDC against their ETH holdings without selling, in a new offering powered by Morpho and running on Base. The exchange said the product is available across most US states, except New York, with variable rates and liquidation risk tied to market conditions. Users can borrow up to $1 million in USDC (USDC) stablecoin. Coinbase plans to expand the program to other assets, including loans backed by its staked Ether token, cbETH. The new product is being launched in collaboration with Morpho, a decentralized finance (DeFi) lending protocol. In September, Coinbase integrated Morpho into the Coinbase app, offering users a yield of up to 10.8% on their USDC holdings. According to Dune data, Coinbase’s onchain lending markets have processed more than $1.25 billion in loan originations, backed by about $1.37 billion in deposited collateral. Roughly $810 million in loans is outstanding, with more than 13,500 wallets holding active borrow positions. Continue reading The DeFi Education Fund, an advocacy organization focused on decentralized finance, has proposed utilizing the technology to reduce costs, aiming to address poverty in the United States and globally. In a Wednesday blog post, the group said DeFi infrastructure could potentially save unbanked and underbanked people around the world about $30 billion annually by reducing remittance costs. The organization cited examples of workers sending funds home and paying fees to do so, which could be reduced “by up to 80%” with DeFi. “The poverty premium [the expenses incurred by low-income households that wealthier individuals are often able to access at a lower cost] persists because the current, layered, antiquated financial infrastructure makes it expensive to serve low-income customers profitably,” said the DeFi Education Fund, adding: “Nothing is free, and DeFi doesn’t eliminate costs entirely, but by removing intermediaries and leveraging software rather than outdated financial systems, we can dramatically reduce the cost of financial services for everyday people and give them greater control of their finances.” Many advocates have proposed utilizing various applications of blockchain technology to address factors that contribute to poverty, such as reducing transaction times, eliminating or reducing fees, and increasing access to financial services. The DeFi Education Fund cited the increasing costs in the US associated with cashing paychecks without a bank account, using money orders and owning a home. Continue reading Mastercard is expanding its Crypto Credential program to self-custody wallets, allowing users to send and receive cryptocurrencies using verified, username-style aliases instead of long wallet addresses. Polygon will be the first blockchain to support the rollout, while payments firm Mercuryo will handle identity verification and issue the aliases to users, according to a Tuesday press release shared with Cointelegraph. “By streamlining wallet addresses and adding meaningful verification, Mastercard Crypto Credential is building trust in digital token transfers,” said Raj Dhamodharan, executive vice president of blockchain and digital assets at Mastercard. Once verified by Mercuryo, users can link a human-readable alias to their self-custody wallet or request a soulbound token on Polygon that proves the wallet belongs to a verified individual.

Title: Why crypto's having a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad month

Crypto's having a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad month, and it could get worse before it gets better, experts said. Cryptocurrencies have cratered this month, losing more than $1 trillion in value in recent weeks. Bitcoin's dropped to the lowest level since April and is on track for its worst month since 2022. It's down more than 33% from its all-time high above $126,000 in early October, which officially pushes the digital unit into bear market territory defined as at least 20% lower than the record high. Bitcoin's now down about 10% this year, and likely will see more selling which could mean its first annual loss since 2022, experts said. At 1:29 p.m. ET, Bitcoin was down 3.18% at $83,776.81. "It seems early in the selloff process," said Hyunsu Jung, chief executive of publicly traded crypto-treasury company Hyperion DeFi. A whirlwind of factors have contributed to crypto's downfall, analysts said. Cryptocurrency tends to trade in line with the riskier growth stocks like in artficial intelligence and technology, which also have been battered lately amid high valuation worries and an uncertain economy. "It would be difficult to attribute selling to a single factor," Jung said. "The current state of the market is risk assets across equities and crypto both seeing pullbacks - due to multiple factors such as: potential exhaustion of the AI trade." Global interest rate uncertainty and moves to cash by corporate digital asset treasuries and other large crypto holders like investment firm Blackrock are also weighing on crypto, Jung said. That initial sell-off pushed cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin through several technical support levels on price charts that triggered a cascade of sales among trend followers, exacerbating the decline. Specifically, key signals that prompted more selling according to Tom Essaye, founder and president of Sevens Report Research, include: The sharp decline could force even more sales, some analysts warned. It's "reawakened concerns about a further wave of forced selling, amid worries that retail investors might need to liquidate other assets to meet margin calls," Deutsche Bank economist Jim Reid said. A margin call is when a brokerage demands an investor deposit more money or securities to cover a shortfall that happens amid a sharp price decline. Once the dust settles - and no one can say yet when that might be - investors with iron stomachs may want to tip toe in, some experts said. After sifting through corporate 13Fs, or a required Securities and Exchange Commission form for institutional investment managers who oversee at least $100 million in assets under management, LPL Financial's portfolio strategist George Smith found "a large increase in cryptocurrency-related products and blockchain mining firms (underscoring) the growing institutional appetite for digital assets." That could bode well for cryptocurrency because institutional investors are often considered "smart money." Again,"no one should ever invest beyond their risk tolerance," said David Namdar, chief executive of CEA Industries, the largest corporate holder of the cryptocurrency Binance Coin. "But historically, moments like this, when sentiment is low and volatility is high, have often been where long-term value is created. Anyone considering an investment should think in years, not days, and should understand the asset’s inherent volatility." Medora Lee is a money, markets and personal finance reporter at USA TODAY.

Title: Why Bitcoin price’s fall below $82,000 threatens to trigger ‘another crypto apocalypse’

About us Copy link A version of this article appeared in our The Roundup newsletter on November 21. Sign up here. Hi. Eric here. Crypto markets are looking grim, and traders worry it will only get worse from here. After Bitcoin’s price fell below $82,000 on Friday, analysts suggest collapsing prices threaten to unearth further industry weaknesses. Think Terra’s collapse culminating with the implosion of FTX, and you get the idea. “Collapses can be swift and brutal — as 2021 to 2022 illustrated — and some traders worry we’re due for a repeat,” crypto analysts Molly White wrote in her newsletter on November 19. There are several factors behind the bearish move. Chief among them is uncertainty caused by the longest-running government shutdown in US history. Though economic data on employment were eventually published this week, the Federal Reserve remains divided on whether or not to cut interest rates. That uncertainty is reflected in expectations of a rate cut next month. On Thursday, CME Group’s Fed Watch tool indicated the chances of a cut were roughly 40%. Today, that’s jumped to 74%. A month ago, that figure was at 98%. Rate cuts usually incentivise investors to bet on riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. Add to that US President Donald Trump’s global trade war, actual wars in Europe and the Middle East, and concerns that the artificial intelligence bubble will pop, and it’s understandable why traders are feeling bearish. To be sure, these factors are not isolated to crypto, but have also rippled across global markets. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq are down almost 3% and 4% respectively over the past month. Crypto has, however, fared worse. It has lost some 14% of its value over the past 30 days — and the fear is that it’s downhill from here. Market seismographs are already picking up tremors, White notes. Tracking platform DappRadar has called it quits because the current environment made their situation “financially unsustainable,” and Stream Finance has halted its operations. Crypto stocks have plummeted. Circle and Gemini’s share prices have both tumbled some 48% over the past 30 days. Similarly, digital asset treasury companies — which were all the rage just months ago but whose success hinges on the expectation that the underlying assets will continue to accrue value — are down across the board. Case in point: Bitcoin treasury pioneer Strategy is down over 40% over the past month. The fear is that this market mayhem will be exacerbated if cryptocurrency prices continue to collapse. The bad news? Analysts at Citrini Research, Kiln, and ShapeShift warned this week that volatility is likely to haunt digital assets for some time yet. Even perennial Bitcoin boosters like BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes have gone bearish. This week, he predicted that Bitcoin could drop to $80,000 “during this period of weakness.” Even so, there are bullish signs. Hayes said cryptocurrencies could rebound if governments start to pump more liquidity into markets. Venture capitalists are still investing in crypto startups. They ploughed $253 million into the industry this week, DefiLlama data shows. That put the total amount raised by the sector to over $23 billion in 2025, DefiLlama data shows. Nevertheless, the mayhem is troubling market watchers of all stripes. “It’s too soon to tell whether this slide is just the beginning of another crypto apocalypse, or if it’s just routine crypto volatility,” White wrote. The US Treasury Department has indicted Ryan James Wedding, a former Canadian Olympic slalom snowboarder, for leading a massive drug trafficking enterprise. Liam Kelly reports. BlackRock and other exchange-traded fund issuers have driven institutional adoption of crypto, but Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin warns that their popularity could pose an existential threat to the blockchain, Pedro Solimano reports. Kraken has filed to go public after months of its co-CEO dodging questions about a potential initial public offering. Post of the Week DappRadar became the latest market casualty this week. After seven years, it's time to say goodbye. pic.twitter.com/QGfRRe6Gts After seven years, it's time to say goodbye. pic.twitter.com/QGfRRe6Gts Update November 21: A previous version of this story suggested that employment data had not been published. It has. The story has been updated to reflect that.

Title: BitMine announces 2026 ETH staking plans as market melts down

Time Published: 2025-11-21T17:40:56Z

The crypto treasury company plans to stake its ETH holdings to generate revenue, but is already down well over $1,000 on each ETH it holds. BitMine, a crypto treasury company that accumulates Ether (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC), said on Friday it plans to launch the “Made in America Validator Network” (MAVAN) to stake its ETH holdings. The company is piloting MAVAN with three staking infrastructure providers, ahead of the launch slated for the first quarter of 2026, according to an announcement from BitMine. Staking tokens to validate proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchains secures networks and generates revenue in the form of staking rewards paid out in the native token of the blockchain network, in this case, ETH. “At scale, we believe our strategy will best serve the long-term best interests of our shareholders," BitMine chairman Tom Lee said. The announcement came amid a broad downturn in the crypto market and crypto treasury companies, which are experiencing a collapse in their multiple on-net asset value (mNAV), a critical metric tracking the price premium placed on a crypto treasury company’s stock. Related: Tom Lee speculates wounded market makers behind crypto crunch BitMine is sitting on over $3.7 billion in unrealized losses due to plummeting ETH prices, according to a report from research company 10x Research. The report, published on Thursday, used an ETH price of $3,023, but the ETH decline extended on Friday, driving the price down to about $2,700 at the time of writing. The price decline means the company is now more than $1,000 underwater on each ETH it holds, after accumulating the asset during its run-up to all-time highs during July and August. ETH’s crash below $3,000 wiped away a year’s worth of gains for crypto treasury companies holding it and could lead to more financial stress for these companies if the price declines further. “Treasury companies will face a hard reality: attracting new retail investors becomes nearly impossible when existing shareholders are sitting on billions in losses,” 10x Research wrote. The treasury model faces increasing competition and eroding market share from asset managers like BlackRock and exchange-traded fund providers, which can give investors lower-cost exposure to digital assets and staking rewards, according to 10x Research.

Title: Hello, Flume: AT&T’s Gigapower Gains a Provider Customer for its Open-Access Network

by Pivot 5G AI BROADBAND NATION CYBERSECURITY FIBER BROADBAND FIXED WIRELESS M&A MARKET RESEARCH MOBILE POLICY RURAL BROADBAND VIDEO Gigapower, the open-access network operator owned by AT&T and BlackRock, said today that it has reached an agreement with Flume to use the network in Mesa, Arizona. Flume is a service provider focused on multi-dwelling units that relies primarily on other providers’ networks for connectivity. The deal with Gigapower is in keeping with that strategy. “Through this relationship, Flume will deliver managed Wi-Fi internet services to residents in select apartment buildings and condominium communities,” Flume and Gigapower said in a press release. AT&T already uses the Gigapower network to offer service to end users in Mesa and other markets, Gigapower Chief Revenue Officer Jeff Seidenfaden confirmed in an email to Telecompetitor. AT&T and BlackRock formed the Gigapower joint venture in 2023. The strategy was to build fiber broadband networks outside AT&T’s traditional local service footprint. AT&T would be the anchor tenant on the networks, but the same networks would also be offered to other providers on a wholesale basis. The Mesa network was one of the first that Gigapower built. Since then, the JV has announced other markets as well. Asked whether Gigapower had agreements with any service providers other than AT&T and Flume to use the open access network, Seidenfaden said, “We will continue to announce our ISP relationships at the right time. We are in active conversations with multiple ISPs to be part of our network.” Some open access network operators refrain from offering service directly to end users. AT&T’s retail presence may be causing some potential Gigapower customers to avoid the network or to at least take a cautious approach toward it. Nevertheless, the Gigapower strategy makes considerable business sense for AT&T. The company has the potential to gain additional revenue through the open access approach. And by working through a JV, AT&T minimizes the amount of capital it must invest in fiber buildouts. Telecompetitor is a publication of Pivot.

Title: Adding DeFi to your 401k: How BlackRock’s staked Ethereum ETF rewires access to ETH rewards

A filing would kick off a new front in the ETH ETF war: pricing, staking access, and custody all in play. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. BlackRock registered the iShares Staked Ethereum Trust in Delaware on Nov. 19, opening a path toward the firm’s first staked Ethereum ETF in the US. The state-level trust registration does not constitute a formal Securities Act of 1933 application. Still, it positions BlackRock to launch a yield-bearing ETH product once the SEC permits staking inside ETF wrappers. The filing follows a separate Nasdaq proposal earlier this year that would retrofit BlackRock’s existing iShares Ethereum Trust ETF to stake a portion of its ETH through Coinbase Custody if regulators approve. BlackRock now pursues two parallel tracks: adding staking to its live spot ETH ETF and creating a dedicated staked Ethereum trust from scratch. The first wave of US spot Ethereum ETFs launched in 2024 without staking after the SEC required issuers to remove the feature. Those funds charge management fees of 0.15% to 0.25%, VanEck’s Ethereum ETF charges 0.20%, while Fidelity’s ETF and iShares ETHA both charge 0.25%. They hold ETH in institutional custody and track the price with no on-chain staking yield passed through to investors. On-chain, roughly 30% of Ethereum’s circulating supply is staked, and network-level rewards have run just under 3% annualized in recent weeks, per reference indices such as Compass’s STYETH and MarketVector’s STKR. Investors who buy a spot ETH ETF today forfeit that 3% yield if the token trades flat. BlackRock enters a market where three distinct staking structures have emerged. The REX-Osprey ETH + Staking ETF trades under the ticker ESK as an actively managed 1940 Act fund that stakes at least 50% of its holdings, charging an all-in fee of 1.28%. VanEck filed a Lido Staked Ethereum ETF structured as a grantor trust that holds stETH rather than native ETH. Grayscale disclosed that its flagship Ethereum Trust can retain up to 23% of staking rewards as additional compensation, while the Ethereum Mini Trust ETF can retain up to 6% of staking rewards. BlackRock’s existing 0.25% fee on ETHA provides a baseline. A dedicated staked ETH trust gives BlackRock three options: keep the 0.25% sponsor fee and pass nearly all staking yield through to investors, add an explicit cut of staking rewards as a second fee layer, or deploy temporary fee waivers to capture market share before normalizing rates. A staked ETH ETF solves a distribution problem for institutions, advisers, and retirement platforms that cannot access DeFi protocols or lack the operational infrastructure to self-stake. A spot ETF that performs native staking converts on-chain yield into a total-return line item compatible with 401(k) accounts and model portfolios. Investors who buy a staked ETF may capture roughly 2% to 3% annually after fees, even if the token price remains flat. BlackRock appears set to use Coinbase Custody for both ether storage and staking, concentrating all operations inside a single US-regulated counterparty. The Nasdaq filing identifies Coinbase as both custodian and staking provider. REX-Osprey uses US Bank with external validators, while VanEck’s Lido fund depends on Lido’s smart contracts and a separate stETH custodian. Regulators may favor BlackRock’s single-counterparty model over structures that route staking through DeFi protocols. The SEC forced issuers to strip staking from the first ETH ETFs because specific staking programs might constitute unregistered securities offerings. BlackRock’s Delaware trust positions the firm at the front of the queue for when that stance softens, but it has no effective registration statement or approved exchange rule. Regulators face three open questions. The first is whether they will permit native staking in a 1933 Act commodity trust or require it to be placed in 1940 Act structures. The second is whether they will treat liquid staking tokens like stETH as equivalent to holding underlying ETH. The third is how much fee extraction from staking they will tolerate before a product crosses into actively managed yield strategy territory. BlackRock’s filing opens three competitive fronts. On pricing, the firm’s scale will compress margins, but the real contest centers on what percentage of staking rewards sponsors retain. On access, a staked ETH ETF brings validator-level yields inside brokerage accounts that will never touch DeFi. On custody, every staked ETF proposal concentrates staking into a handful of custodians. As more ETH migrates into ETF shells, more of the network’s staking power will be held by institutional keys.

Stella Gallagher. A woman who died after a knife attack which also left her husband seriously injured will be buried next week. Funeral details have been announced for Stella Gallagher (59) who was hailed as a dearly loved wife and mother. Mrs Gallagher (59) died at Cork University Hospital (CUH) where she had been rushed by paramedics on Monday evening after suffering critical injuries when she and her husband, Brian, were attacked by a knife-wielding man near their Shrewsbury Downs home in Ballinlough, Cork. The incident occurred shortly before 9pm. Mr Gallagher was seriously injured during the incident and continues to recover at CUH. Mrs Gallagher was a retired chemical engineer. She was originally from Ballinspittle and was known under her maiden name of Griffin at her workplace, Eli Lilly. Her death notice reads that Mrs Gallagher is survived by her husband Brian and her children Ciara, Conor and Mark. She is also sadly missed by her brother Denis, parents-in-law Val and Geraldine, brothers-in-law Alan and Mark, sisters-in-law Erika, Ann, Michele and Mary, nephews, nieces, extended family and friends. The "much loved mother" will lie in repose at the Temple Hill Funeral Home in Boreenmanna Road in Cork from 5pm to 6pm next Monday. Her Requiem Mass will take place at 11am on Tuesday in the Church of Our Lady of Lourdes in Ballinlough. The Mass will be live streamed. Mrs Gallagher's burial will follow at St Michael’s Cemetery in Blackrock in Cork city. One mourner described the late Mrs Gallagher as a “gentle lady with a ready smile” whilst another said that she was a “wonderful person.” Neighbours in the tightknit estate also paid tribute to her. Taoiseach Micheál Martin lives in the Ballinlough area and admitted the thoughts and prayers of everyone in the community is with the family involved. The National Women’s Council of Ireland also offered its “deepest sympathies” to the loved ones of Mrs Gallagher. In a statement, the NWC said "that their thoughts are especially with her husband Brian who was also seriously injured and remains in a stable condition in hospital." Last Wednesday, Mrs Gallagher's son, David (25), was charged in connection with the fatal attack. David Gallagher, with an address at Shrewsbury Downs, Ballinlough, Cork was charged before Cork District Court with the murder of his mother and with assault causing harm to his father. Mr Gallagher was remanded in custody and will appear before Cork District Court again by video link on November 26.

Title: How Trump can end ‘woke capital’ — and free US companies to get back to business
URL: https://nypost.com/2025/11/21/opinion/trump-can-end-woke-capital-and-get-us-companies-back-to-business/

In his second term, President Donald Trump certainly hasn’t been afraid to go bold — and now it could be the stock market’s turn. Trump’s administration is eyeing a major overhaul in how the feds oversee the market, The Wall Street Journal has reported. The slate of reforms under consideration could be the biggest positive development for our financial markets since the early days of the Reagan administration, if not since the creation of the federal securities laws themselves. It could also finally put the brakes on the rise of “woke capital.” For years, political activists have been using America’s biggest corporations as vehicles for their social agenda. They call it “ESG” — environmental, social and governance investing — but it really boils down to pressuring companies to take political stands that most ordinary investors never asked for, from Black Lives Matter to “climate justice.” The most famous example came in 2021, when a tiny “green” hedge fund named Engine No. 1 managed to get two climate-activist directors on the board of oil giant Exxon Mobil. How did political actors disguised as investors convince other shareholders to elect oil-hostile directors to the board of a petroleum company? Simple: They captured the votes of the massive passive index fund giants — BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street. These “Big Three” firms hold more than 20% of the entire US stock-market capitalization; one of the three is the largest shareholder in 88% of S&P 500 companies. Passive index funds were built to give regular Americans an easy way to invest without paying high fees or obsessing over stock-picking. Rather than trying to guess which stocks will outperform others, these funds simply adjust their holdings to mirror the overall stock market. Investors’ holdings rise and fall with the market as a whole. That’s great for the average Joe; I invest much of my own retirement savings with Vanguard’s passive index funds. They make saving easy, so it’s not surprising that passive index funds have continued to gain market share. Here’s the catch: While the passive funds have invested passively, they have been active in trying to tell the companies in which they invest how to run their affairs. Since these funds aren’t picking individual stocks, they don’t bear any cost when they get things wrong. Subscribe to our daily Post Opinion newsletter! Please provide a valid email. By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. Never miss a story. Their lack of “skin in the game” also made it relatively easy for a certain class of social and political activists — almost always leaning to the left — to capture these funds’ “shareholder engagement” offices. That’s why we’ve seen the Big Three passive funds pushing companies to take woke actions — from climate pledges to race-based hiring policies — regardless of what most shareholders actually want. Whenever you’ve seen a company “go woke,” it’s a safe bet that it’s done so with a passive index fund looking over its shoulder. That’s where the Trump administration’s emerging idea comes in: Instead of letting three giant index fund families dominate shareholder votes, the Securities and Exchange Commission could require them to vote the same way they invest — passively. How would that work? One straightforward approach, inspired by the INDEX Act proposed by Sen. Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska), would let actual underlying investors — ordinary Americans — who hold index-fund shares decide how those shares should be voted. In reality, though, that’s impractical. Most passive-fund investors don’t want to wade into corporate governance any more than they want to pick stocks themselves — and managing such a process would be unwieldy and expensive. That’s why the most sensible solution is also the simplest: Passive funds should mirror how the rest of the shareholders vote. In other words, just follow the crowd. Passive investors should be passive voters. And here’s the good news: The SEC has the power to make this happen right now. It helped create today’s shareholder-voting system through its own guidance, and it can fix it the same way — by issuing a rule that keeps index-fund managers from using other people’s retirement savings to advance political causes. For too long, left-wing activists have used corporate annual meetings as a workaround to push policies they could never get through Congress. If the White House acts, it can shut down this backdoor political machine and return corporate America to its real job: creating value for workers, retirees, and everyday investors. By making passive investors passive voters as well, the president has a big, bold opportunity to make American capital markets even greater. James R.

Title: Memecoin market sinks to 2025 low as $5B wiped out in a day

Both memecoins and NFTs have plunged to their weakest levels since early 2025, with traders pulling back from speculative assets across the board. Memecoins plunged to their lowest valuation in 2025 on Friday, dropping to a combined market capitalization of $39.4 billion, according to data aggregator CoinMarketCap. The sector shed over $5 billion in 24 hours, declining from $44 billion despite a 40% increase in trading volume. This marks a big reversal from the year’s peak on Jan. 5, when the memecoin market cap collectively hit a high of $116.7 billion. Friday’s rout marks a 66.2% drawdown from the 2025 high. The sharp sell-off mirrors a broader decline across the digital asset market. CoinGecko data shows that the total crypto market cap fell from $3.77 trillion on Nov. 1 to $2.96 trillion on Friday, wiping out $800 billion in just three weeks. At the time of writing, Bitcoin (BTC), the market’s top asset, traded at $82,778, down 14.7% over the past week. Ether (ETH) showed similar losses, falling 16% to $2,688 over the seven-day period. At the time of writing, the top 10 memecoins by valuation are deep in the red across every major time frame, including the 1-hour, 24-hour and seven-day charts. This suggests that the risk appetite in the sector declined. The biggest memecoins, Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB), posted double-digit losses, while tokens like Pepe (PEPE), Bonk (BONK) and Floki (FLOKI) saw even steeper declines. Across the board, seven-day drops ranged from 11% on the low end to over 20% for the tokens hit the hardest. United States President Donald Trump’s Official Trump (TRUMP) memecoin was the least affected, but still slid 11.65% over the past week. The token is followed by Dogecoin, which declined 14.10% and SPX6900, which lost 14.26% in value. Bonk, Pudgy Penguiins (PENGU), Pepe and Dogwifhat (WIF) recorded the deepest weekly losses at about 20% each. Related: BlackRock Bitcoin ETF sheds $2.47B in November as outflows hit record $3.79B The non-fungible token (NFT) market, another speculative corner of the crypto ecosystem, also faced steep losses alongside memecoins and broader digital assets. CoinGeko data shows that the NFT market cap fell to $2.78 billion on Friday, down 43% from its $4.9 billion valuation 30 days ago. The figure represents the lowest market cap for digital collectibles since April, reflecting a fading demand for NFTs. A majority of the top 10 NFT collections posted double-digit declines in the last month. The biggest loser was Hyperliquid’s Hypurr NFTs, dropping 41.1% in 30 days. It was followed by Moonbirds and CryptoPunks, which posted a 32.7% and 27.1% loss, respectively. Pudgy Penguins also lost about 26.6% in the same time frame. Only two collections bucked the sector-wide slump. Infinex Patrons posted an 11.3% gain in the last 30 days, making it the best performer among the top 10 NFT collections. Meanwhile, Autoglyphs held relatively steady with only a 1.9% loss, the smallest decline among the group.

Title: Ethereum Co-Founder Highlights Threats From BlackRock’s Institutional Influence
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-co-founder-threats-from-blackrock/
Time Published: 2025-11-21T11:00:32Z
Full Content:
At the Devconnect conference in Buenos Aires, Ethereum (ETH) co-founder Vitalik Buterin raised concerns about the increasing dominance of institutional giants like BlackRock over cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin (BTC) and ETH. He emphasized that this growing influence could potentially lead to significant challenges for the decentralized nature of these networks. Buterin was prompted to address this issue during a discussion on the implications of institutional interest, especially following BlackRock’s launch of Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in early 2024. He questioned how the cryptocurrency community could safeguard against being “captured” by large entities such as BlackRock, highlighting a pressing concern about the future of decentralization in the space. Buterin also expressed apprehension that if institutional players continue to expand their Ethereum holdings, those who prioritize decentralization might find themselves marginalized. This situation could result in fundamental changes to the Ethereum network, optimizing it for institutional needs and making it increasingly difficult for everyday users to operate nodes. Buterin warned, “It easily drives other people away,” further stating the necessity of concentrating on attributes that would typically be scarce, such as creating a global, permissionless, and censorship-resistant protocol. This week, BlackRock made headlines by registering a staked Ethereum fund in Delaware, indicating its intention to enter the staked Ethereum ETF market. Their flagship Ethereum ETF currently manages approximately $10 billion worth of ETH tokens. In addition to the concerns surrounding institutional involvement, the specter of quantum computing looms large over the future of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Recently, Google announced a breakthrough in quantum computing capabilities, following similar advancements at Microsoft, which unveiled a new quantum-enabling chip earlier this year. Quantum researcher Scott Aaronson noted the alarming potential for quantum computers to execute Shor’s algorithm, which could compromise the encryption standards securing Bitcoin and Ethereum. He suggested that the current pace of hardware innovation might lead to the development of a fault-tolerant quantum computer before the next US presidential election, escalating the urgency around potential vulnerabilities in blockchain technology. “We don’t need to panic, but we need to get serious,” asserted Alex Pruden, CEO of quantum computing risk company Project 11. He cautioned that sufficiently advanced quantum computers could break cryptocurrencies at their most fundamental level. As the discussion shifts toward the need for proactive measures, Bitcoin developers have also been urged to prepare for a post-quantum future, which some experts predict could materialize as early as 2030. Théau Peronnin, CEO of Alice & Bob, advised during the Web Summit conference in Lisbon that developers should consider transitioning to a stronger blockchain by 2030 to safeguard against potential quantum threats. “You should have a few good years ahead of you, but I wouldn’t hold my Bitcoin,” he warned, emphasizing the importance of addressing these challenges head-on.

Title: BlackRock clients dump Bitcoin as price hits $81,900. Here’s why analysts say the $3.8bn ETF flush will only get worse

About us Copy link Bitcoin plunged to $81,900 on Friday, wiping out Thursday’s bounce and further extending a month-long selloff that has erased more than $1.4 trillion from the cryptocurrency markets. Bitcoin is trading more than 30% below its October all-time high, and the overall crypto market is under $3 trillion. And analysts warn that the carnage may get worse. Citrini Research warned in a note to investors shared with DL News that risk-off sentiment will continue to hit speculative assets such as crypto into mid-December. Why? Because the investors are still dealing with the fallout from the longest US government shutdown in history, which could “unleash volatility” in the market. ‘If BTC is decoupling from its programmed cadence, I think the market could be mispricing both upside potential and downside risk.’ A toxic cocktail is hammering risk appetite across crypto and stocks. Wall Street posted its sharpest intraday reversal in years, Nvidia’s rally fizzled, and new macroeconomic data is fuelling fears that the US Federal Reserve may postpone rate cuts. Adding to the confusion is Bitcoin’s four-year cycle, an expected price movement pattern tied to the top crypto’s quadrennial halving event when rewards to miners validating the blockchain are cut by half. A growing chorus of analysts says that institutional adoption of digital assets has made that narrative obsolete. “If BTC is decoupling from its programmed cadence, I think the market could be mispricing both upside potential and downside risk,” Robert Le, head of research at Kiln, told DL News. And investors are becoming skittish. Total liquidations over the past 24 hours hit $2 billion. Investors pulled $548 million from Bitcoin exchange-traded funds on Thursday, bringing November’s outflows to $3.77 billion, DefiLlama data shows. BlackRock clients led the nosedive, dumping $355 million from the flagship iShares Bitcoin Trust, which has been the worst month for ETFs this year since February. Bitcoin’s tumble below $82,000 comes on the back of Thursday’s long-awaited release of September’s jobs report, the first major data since the end of the government shutdown, which did little to reassure investors. The Bureau of Labour Statistics said the US economy added 119,000 jobs, well above the 51,000 expected, while unemployment ticked up to 4.4%. The stronger-than-expected hiring, combined with skyrocketing employment, left something for both dovish and hawkish Federal Reserve reps to consider as they’re set to discuss interest rates in December. Lower interest rate cuts are usually bullish for riskier assets like digital assets and tech stocks, as it incentivises investors to bet on them. To some, mixed data further fogged up the interest-rate outlook and added to the narrative spun by White House that the Federal Reserve is ‘flying blind’ after weeks without key data. Meanwhile, cracks within the Fed are widening. Philadelphia Fed President Anna Paulson warned, “I am approaching the December FOMC cautiously. Each rate cut raises the bar for the next cut,” Bloomberg reported. And Paulson isn’t the only decision maker signalling no rate cut to investors. Fed Governor Michael Barr added fresh hawkish pressure, saying “I am concerned that we’re seeing inflation still at around 3%… we need to be careful and cautious.” The CME FedWatch tool now assigns roughly 35% odds to a December rate cut, down sharply from earlier this month. Bettors on Polymarket are even less optimistic, at 31%. The US stock market also suffered its worst whipsaw in months, Bloomberg reported. The Nasdaq plunged 2.1% by Thursday’s close. The S&P 500 fell 1.5%, while the Dow shed 380 points. Nvidia, which surged more than 5% early in the Thursday trading session on another blockbuster earnings beat, finished 3.1% lower as AI-bubble fears resurfaced. The S&P 500’s 3% intraday reversal was the largest since April’s Trump tariff turmoil. Analysts argued that even Nvidia’s defiant numbers couldn’t offset deepening valuation concerns across the AI complex. Lance Datskoluo is DL News’ Europe-based markets correspondent. Got a tip?

Title: BlackRock Bitcoin ETF sheds $2.47B in November as outflows hit record $3.79B

BlackRock’s IBIT drives November’s record ETF outflows, bleeding $2.47 billion and accounting for 63% of the $3.79 billion withdrawn from US spot Bitcoin ETFs. US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds saw another sharp reversal on Thursday, erasing a brief moment of relief earlier in the week. After breaking a five-day outflow streak with $75.4 million in inflows on Wednesday, the funds were hit with fresh redemptions of $903 million Thursday — the biggest outflow day in November and one of the largest single-day outflows since the products were launched in January 2024, according to Farside Investors. The $3.79 billion withdrawal puts November on track to be the worst month on record for US spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETF outflows if the remaining days fail to offset this month’s redemptions. The figure has already surpassed February’s $3.56 billion, which held the record for the largest monthly outflow since the ETFs debuted. Investment giant BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) ETF is the largest driver of the historic November outflows. The product has seen $2.47 billion in net redemptions so far this month, accounting for roughly 63% of the total $3.79 billion withdrawn from all US spot BTC ETFs. The fund also led this week’s outflows with $1.02 billion. Ki Young Ju, the founder and CEO of analytics platform CryptoQuant, flagged this week’s performance as IBIT’s “largest weekly outflow ever.” Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) followed as the second-largest outflow driver in November with monthly outflows of $1.09 billion. Just this week, the issuer has seen $225.9 million withdrawn so far, reflecting moderate but persistent redemptions. While FBTC’s outflows remain smaller than IBIT’s, both funds contributed to the broader liquidity drain that pushed November past February’s record for the heaviest month of Bitcoin ETF outflows. Together, they account for 91% of total US spot BTC ETF outflows in November. Related: Bitcoin won’t hit $200K until Q3 2029: Veteran trader Peter Brandt According to CoinGecko, Bitcoin fell to $83,461 on Friday, following the nearly $1 billion in ETF outflows. The drop pushed BTC to its lowest level in seven months, a price zone last seen in April. Industry voices say the downturn may only be the start. Alliance DAO co-founder QwQiao reposted his warning in September, arguing that the next bear market may be harsher than expected. “There’s a large cohort of dumb money who know nothing about crypto buying DATs and ETFs. This never ends well,” he wrote, adding that markets may need to endure another “50% drawdown” before a durable foundation can be formed. Chris Burniske, the co-founder of crypto venture firm Placeholder, said that the era of DAT selling has only begun,” cautioning that just as ETFs and digital asset treasuries (DATs) amplified Bitcoin’s ascent, they could equally intensify the move downward. DefiLlama data shows that DAT inflows dropped to $1.93 billion in October, an 82% decrease from September’s $10.89 billion. Data showed that inflows significantly decreased after about $20 billion in crypto positions were liquidated in October. At the time of writing, DAT inflows have only reached $505 million. At this rate, November is on track to become the lowest month for DAT inflows in 2025.

November 21, 2025 03:00 ET | Source: HelloTrade HelloTrade New York, NY,, Nov. 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- HelloTrade, a new blockchain-powered trading platform founded by former BlackRock crypto directors Wyatt Raich and Kevin Tang, announced that it has closed a $4.6M seed round led by Dragonfly Capital. The round came together in under a week, reflecting strong conviction in the size of the market opportunity and the team’s track record building category-defining products. At BlackRock, Kevin and Wyatt launched the firm’s spot Bitcoin ETF, the fastest ETF in history to reach $100B in assets. For decades, access to the world’s capital markets and leveraged equity trading has been constrained by geography, high capital requirements, complex derivatives, and legacy brokerage systems. These barriers have made obtaining directional exposure and leverage to global equities challenging for retail and professional investors. HelloTrade aims to change that. Built on MegaETH, the platform will let users everywhere gain leveraged exposure to stocks, ETFs, commodities, and crypto. The app is designed for everyday investors with a mobile first experience, removing the usual points of friction that come with crypto trading. There is no wallet setup, no gas payments, and no technical jargon. Users simply open the app and trade with the speed of a traditional brokerage platform, enabled by MegaETH’s ability to process more than one hundred thousand transactions per second. “Trading stocks with leverage shouldn’t be gated by geography or account minimums,” said co-founder Kevin Tang. “We’ve now seen how crypto derivatives transformed access to digital assets. HelloTrade applies that same ethos to traditional equities, making it possible for investors around the world to participate in the world’s most dynamic markets”. The company is supported by a strong group of advisors, including Arthur Hayes (Maelstrom), Josh Lim (FalconX), David C. (LeadBlock Partners & LeadBlock Bitpanda Ventures), Larry Florio (Ethena), and Andrew Saunders (Amazon). “While leading the engineering team for BlackRock’s Digital Assets Lab, I had the privilege of building IBIT, ETHA, and BUIDL, some of the largest cryptoasset products in the world. That experience highlighted a tremendous opportunity to bring the same trust, discipline, and institutional standards we upheld at BlackRock to the rest of the world and build something truly transformative with HelloTrade,” said co-founder Wyatt Raich, and prior head of digital assets engineering at BlackRock. About HelloTradeKevin and Wyatt first crossed paths at BlackRock as foundational team members in the firm’s digital assets division. Despite their different backgrounds-Kevin as a financial services veteran with over 12-years experience, and Wyatt coming from a career in AI and robotics at Lockheed Martin-the two shared a conviction that blockchain technology could transform capital markets and investing. HelloTrade is expected to launch in the form of a mobile app across both iOS and Android. For early access, a waitlist is currently live at hello.trade.Disclaimer: The information provided in this press release is not a solicitation for investment, nor is it intended as investment advice, financial advice, or trading advice.

Business FILE PHOTO: U.S. dollar notes are seen in this November 7, 2016 picture illustration. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo (Refiles to add ANALYSIS tag back, no changes to text) By Alun John and Naomi Rovnick LONDON :Just months after a U.S. tariff shock whacked the dollar, a rush by overseas investors to protect U.S. holdings from the sliding currency has slowed sharply - a vote of confidence that's helping the greenback recover from its worst rout in years. While analysts say investor hedging is higher than it has been historically, such activity has slowed from the period immediately after the April 2 "Liberation Day", when U.S. President Donald Trump announced sweeping trade tariffs.

Loading At that time, foreign investors holding U.S. assets were hit by tumbling stock and bond prices and a plummeting dollar. Nimble investors moved to hedge against a further dollar decline and the trend was expected to gain momentum. Instead, it has slowed, allowing the U.S. currency to stabilise."The conversations we're having with clients now suggest that these (hedging) flows are less likely to come as imminently as the conversations we had back in May suggested they would," said David Leigh, Nomura's global head of FX and emerging markets. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against other major currencies, has rallied nearly 4 per cent since the end of June, when it was nursing losses of almost 11 per cent after its biggest first-half dive since the early 1970s. Data on hedging is limited and analysts extrapolate from scarce public figures and numbers compiled by banks and custodians. Analysis of client positioning by BNY, one of the world's largest custodians, shows they were very long U.S. assets in early 2025, suggesting they didn't anticipate much additional dollar weakness and were happy to operate without much hedging.That changed in April and hedging is now higher than normal, although lower than in late 2023 when markets began to anticipate Federal Reserve rate cuts."The dollar diversification story this year is more talked about than actioned upon," said Geoff Yu, BNY's senior market strategist. Other giant custodians reported a similar picture. State Street Markets' analysis of the assets State Street has under custody and administration showed that as of end October, foreign equity managers’ hedging of their dollar holdings was 24 per cent, a 4 per centage-point increase since February, but well below the 30 per cent-plus hedge ratio they have seen in the past. They too said it had slowed in recent weeks. It varies by market too. A November National Australia Bank survey of Australian pension funds found "no material change in hedging behaviour towards U.S. equities". Danish central bank data, however, shows hedging by pension funds there has stabilised after increasing post-April. Columbia Threadneedle CIO William Davies said that the firm initially moved to protect its U.S. stock holdings against further dollar weakness but has since unwound some of its hedges, betting the currency won't decline further. NO SNOWBALL EFFECTHedging itself causes currencies to move - adding protection against dollar downside to a previously unhedged position effectively involves selling the greenback, and vice versa. If combined with shifting interest rates, the effect can be dramatic - a dollar selloff can spark more hedging, sending it lower still. "People, earlier this year, were getting excited that this snowball effect would develop, though in the end it didn't really," said HSBC's Paul Mackel, global head of FX research. For next year, "it's something to keep an eye on, but it's not our baseline scenario". Still investor behaviour may be shifting. BlackRock estimates that 38 per cent of flows into Europe, Middle East and Africa-listed U.S. equity exchange-traded products this year have been into those with FX hedges, a meaningful change from 2024 when 98 per cent of flows were unhedged. COST, CORRELATIONS AND COMPLICATIONS Cost is also a factor, and depends on rate differentials and so varies by market. This may help explain some of the reluctance to hedge positions.Japanese investors pay around an annualised 3.7 per cent to hedge against dollar weakness, estimates Van Luu, Russell Investments' global head of solutions strategy for fixed income and FX. This is a sizeable sum - if dollar/yen holds steady for a year, an investor is down 3.7 per cent versus an unhedged peer. The equivalent cost for a euro-funded investor is around 2 per cent."I have a rule of thumb for euro investors, if the cost is around 1 per cent they don't care much, but if it's 2 per cent then it becomes a factor," Luu said. Asset correlations matter too. Traditionally the dollar strengthens when stocks fall, meaning overseas investors are effectively protected on their U.S. positions. That did not happen in April, contributing to the hedging rush. This month, the dollar held steady as stocks tumbled again.Change is also complicated for the many investors who aim to outperform a fixed benchmark if that benchmark is unhedged. Fidelity International recommends Europe-based investors move gradually towards hedging 50 per cent of their dollar exposure, but Salman Ahmed, head of macro and strategic asset allocation, notes it is a "very involved" process which can require governance and benchmark changes.If interest rates move against the dollar and it starts to weaken again, and hedges become cheaper, pressure for change may build. "There's still lots of scope for dollar investments to be hedged, whether that comes to pass and how quickly is an open question," said Nomura's Leigh. "That's what the FX market's trying to get its head around." At that time, foreign investors holding U.S. assets were hit by tumbling stock and bond prices and a plummeting dollar.

Title: BitMine’s Unrealized Losses Hit $3.7B As Ethereum (ETH) Price Struggles Below $3,000

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. A recent report discussed how Digital Asset Treasury (DAT) companies like BitMine and Strategy are sitting on billions of dollars of unrealized profits as Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) lose crucial support levels. On Thursday, crypto insights company 10x Research reported that the largest Ethereum Treasury company, BitMine Immersion Technologies, has a multi-billion-dollar paper loss after the ongoing market correction, which has sent ETH to multi-month lows. “Bitmine is now down more than $1,000 per ETH, implying about $3.7 billion in unrealized losses before even accounting for the hefty NAV [net asset value] premium public-market investors paid on top,” the report highlighted. 10x Research believes that treasury companies will struggle to attract new retail investors amid the current market environment, where existing shareholders are sitting on billions of dollars in losses. When NAV rises, “old” shareholders benefit; when it falls, the damage compounds, a dynamic DAT investors often underestimate. When the premium inevitably shrinks to zero, as it is doing now, investors find themselves trapped in the structure, unable to get out without significant damage, a true Hotel California scenario. Unlike Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), Digital Asset Treasuries “layer on complex, opaque, and often hedge-fund-like fee structures that can quietly erode returns,” the report added, noting that many investors are unaware that DATs embedded costs “far exceed” the management fee charged by asset managers like BlackRock on its Bitcoin (BTC) and ETH ETFs. Moreover, 10x Research argued that with the potential introduction of a staked Ethereum ETF by BlackRock, “the economics of DATs are likely to face increasing scrutiny” as retail investors reallocate to a low-cost source of yield. Despite DAT challenges and ETH’s price action, BitMine has continued to bet on the King of Altcoins. According to Lookonchain data, a new wallet suspected to be linked to the Ethereum-focused treasury company purchased 21,054 ETH, worth around $66.57 million at the time, on Tuesday night. In its November Chairman’s Message, Thomas ‘Tom’ Lee, noted that the crypto market prices have not recovered from the October 10 liquidation event, and “the lingering weakness has the hallmarks of a market maker (or two) suffering from a crippled balance sheet.” BitMine does not believe crypto prices have peaked for this cycle, he added, suggesting that “a crypto cycle top is likely 12-36 months away.” On the contrary, Lee told CNBC News on Monday that the market is “pretty close” to bottoming this week. Crypto suffered from that liquidation event on October 10th, but because the fundamental story is intact and crypto discounts the future, that’s why it’s volatile, but it still looks pretty attractive here. Notably, ETH has lost the $3,000 support for the first time since July, retesting the $2,800 area on Thursday morning. However, Lee has affirmed that “Ethereum is undervalued because number one, the story is gaining relative to Bitcoin this year. But two, we’re getting this sort of intrinsic floor because of the value that the assets locked onto the Ethereum blockchain.” As of this writing, Ethereum is trading at $2,840, a 29% decline in the monthly timeframe.

Her goal as a writer is to create informative, complete, and easily understandable pieces accessible to those entering the crypto space. After learning about cryptocurrencies in 2019, Rubmar became curious about the world of possibilities the industry offered, quickly learning that financial freedom was at the palm of her hand with the developing technology. From a young age, Rubmar was curious about how languages work, finding special interest in wordplay and the peculiarities of dialects. Her curiosity grew as she became an avid reader in her teenage years. She explored freedom and new words through her favorite books, which shaped her view of the world. Rubmar acquired the necessary skills for in-depth research and analytical thinking at university, where she studied Literature and Linguistics. Her studies have given her a sharp perspective on several topics and allowed her to turn every stone in her investigations. In 2019, she first dipped her toes in the crypto industry when a friend introduced her to Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, but it wasn’t until 2020 that she started to dive into the depth of the industry. As Rubmar began to understand the mechanics of the crypto sphere, she saw a new world yet to be explored. At the beginning of her crypto voyage, she discovered a new system that allowed her to have control over her finances. As a young adult of the 21st century, Rubmar has faced the challenges of the traditional banking system and the restrictions of fiat money. After the failure of her home country’s economy, the limitations of traditional finances became clear. The bureaucratic, outdated structure made her feel hopeless and powerless amid an aggressive and distorted system created by hyperinflation. However, learning about decentralization and self-custody opened a realm of opportunities. Cryptocurrencies allowed her to experience financial control for the first time and expand her financial education. Moreover, the peculiar nature of the crypto community sparked Rubmar’s curiosity about the other layers of the industry. As a result, she found a particular interest in discovering the diverse perspectives of investors, market watchers, experts, and developers. Her attempts to better understand the crypto space made her realize the strong links of the community with other industries, enriching her perspective of the sector. As someone who spends most of her day online, Rubmar enjoys finding the points where the crypto world meets with her other passions and hobbies ­–or her favorite memes. In her free time, she usually finds joy in different art forms. As a child, she enlisted in every extra-curricular activity in her hometown, including music classes, dancing, jewelry making, and the local chorus. Despite her many attempts to learn different instruments, Rubmar only knows how to play the xylophone, which she played for 7 years in her school’s marching band. She also has a passion for learning new languages and cultures, having set the goal to learn another six languages ­– currently attempting to learn Italian and Korean. Scrapbooking, paper crafting, and bookbinding are her biggest interests outside of work, constantly taking classes and attending workshops to learn new techniques. The rest of her free time is spent stressing over football matches and transfer market news or feeding cats –hers or stray.

Title: Plume CEO tips RWA to grow 3-5x in 2026 as it grows past crypto natives

Plume says that Securitize, a tokenization platform backed by BlackRock and Morgan Stanley, has inked a deal to deploy institutional-grade assets on Plume’s Nest staking protocol. The real-world asset (RWA) market value could more than triple by 2026, as it expands beyond crypto-native use cases and utility, according to Chris Yin, co-founder and CEO of RWA-focused layer-2 blockchain Plume. Speaking to Cointelegraph, Yin said that RWA value has taken off in the last year and he expects it to increase by three to five times in 2026, as a base case. “Currently, we are tracking to over 10x the RWA holders number since the start of the year and so we expect us to keep inflecting and we think it’s not crazy to imagine another banner year with 25x+ in user growth numbers,” he said. Over $35 billion in RWA is estimated to be onchain, according to RWA.xyz, across more than 539,000 holders. Yin said the market of tokenized RWAs is entirely serving crypto natives but predicts it will grow exponentially across total value, users, asset classes and utility. “Whereas today the vast majority of RWA value is in US treasury bills, the market maturing and the combination of rate cuts is pushing onchain users to seek higher yields in new places,” he said. Regulations could also play a factor. Many countries, such as the US, are working on legislation governing stablecoins and other tokenized assets. Yin said this will help move them out of the sandbox and into real-life usage soon. “Outside of pure issuance on the supply side, we expect to begin to see the demand side finally come onchain,” Yin added. Plume announced on Wednesday that Securitize, a tokenization platform backed by BlackRock and Morgan Stanley, plans to deploy institutional-grade assets on Plume’s Nest staking protocol. Related: Plume Network gains SEC transfer agent status to bring TradFi onchain The Nest staking protocol allows investors to trade and earn yield on tokenized assets. The partnership will connect Securitize’s tokenized funds to Plume’s network of over 280,000 RWA holders, according to Plume. Hamilton Lane funds will be the first, and then other issuers and asset classes from Securitize’s platform will follow in 2026. Plume has 279,692 RWA holders, which makes up around 50% of the total number of holders across all RWA networks. Plume, however, isn’t in the top ten networks according to RWA.xyz. However, Yin explains that Plume has a huge share of users, but each holder may have fewer RWA assets than on other networks. “Plume has 280,000 users holding an aggregate $200 million of RWAs, which is a much healthier measure of usage on a network,” he added.

Group’s founder and chairman, Tim Martin, backed Leave campaign Founder and chairman of JD Wetherspoon Tim Martin. Photo: Getty UK pub and hotel group JD Wetherspoon – whose founder campaigned for the UK to leave the EU – is using Ireland as a springboard for its expansion into mainland Europe to avoid Brexit-­induced red tape, the Irish Independent has learnt. The stock market-listed group, which owns a small number of pubs in Ireland, has been eyeing locations in Spain for its debut on the Continent. The new ventures will typically be operated on a franchise basis, following the success of franchise partnerships the group has in the UK with universities and a holiday parks firm. The first premises on the Continent is due to open next year. But UK trade with the EU now subject to significant barriers as a result of Brexit. Founder and chairman of JD Wetherspoon Tim Martin. Photo: Getty News in 90 Seconds - 21 November 2025 JD Wetherspoon founder and chairman Tim Martin was a strong advocate for Brexit, donating hundreds of thousands of pounds to the campaign for the UK to leave the European Union. Following the 2016 vote, the UK went on to leave the EU almost six years ago, hitting business between British firms and the trade bloc. A spokesman for JD Wetherspoon, which operates a total of about 800 pubs, confirmed that the pubs company will now use a newly established subsidiary in Dublin to launch its business in mainland Europe. “Given our current plans for a number of franchise sites in Europe, it is more straightforward if the agreements are between EU-based companies and JD Wetherspoon Europe has been set up [in Dublin] as a result,” he said. JD Wetherspoon opened its first pub in Ireland in 2014, with The Three Tun Tavern in Blackrock, Co Dublin. Later the same year, it opened a premises in Dún Laoghaire. It later opened a handful of pubs in Cork, Carlow and Waterford. However, in 2023 it put those properties, as well as a premises it planned to open in Galway, up for sale. It sold The Three Tun Tavern in 2022. It still operates five pubs in Dublin. Businesses never regret increased democracy because democracy and prosperity are inextricably linked After the UK voted in favour of leaving the EU in 2016, Mr Martin hailed the outcome of the referendum as a victory for democracy. “Businesses never regret increased democracy because democracy and prosperity are inextricably linked,” he said in an interview with the BBC at the time. Addressing the International Monetary Fund last month, the UK’s chancellor of the exchequer, Rachel Reeves, said that Brexit has caused long-term damage to the UK’s economy. The UK’s Office for Budgetary Responsibility recently claimed that Brexit will reduce the UK’s productivity by 4pc in the long term. Mr Martin, who was knighted in 2023, said in January this year that JD Wetherspoon is looking at expanding overseas. He cited destinations in Spain such as Alicante, Mallorca and Benidorm that are popular with British holidaymakers as the types of locations that would be suitable for the group. In the year to July 27, 2025, JD Wetherspoon reported revenue of £2.1bn (€2.4bn), a 17pc increase on the previous financial year. Its like-for-like sales rose 5.1pc and it made a pre-tax profit of £81.4m. The group held its annual general meeting yesterday .

Title: 6 hacks to a better government
URL: https://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2025/11/6_hacks_to_a_better_government.html
Time Published: 2025-11-21T05:00:00Z

Antisocial people run in packs. They exert concentrated power, but they are decidedly in the minority. Prosocial people operate individualistically, but in the aggregate, they have much-greater power. Prosocial people can be defeated only by themselves. Many familiar practices don’t utilize power effectively. Some new practices also wouldn’t. Use power effectively these 6 ways: 1. Worship, love, and save. Individual faith in Christ limits the envy that stymies economic growth. Individual faith also strengthens lesser magistrates to limit greater magistrates, which secures individuals’ rights. Love is disciplined action that builds healthy relationships. Saving builds productivity. 2. Choose assets, and consumer products, whose producers do the least harm. Stocks provide the greatest long-term returns of any single class of investment. Choosing stocks in normal times, but choosing gold instead in crisis times, provides even-greater long-term returns. In normal times that include routine government-money-error cycles, stocks provide the greatest returns. In crisis times, when money producers have been more greatly inflating the money quantity, and more greatly suppressing profits, gold shelters assets and provides better returns. Shopping for the best added value is the key ingredient that makes voluntary cooperation select for the producers that add the most value. But this added value can give fund managers and corporate managers the power and control to pursue ends that harm everyone. Individuals can limit such harms by moving their investments out of funds like those of BlackRock and Vanguard, by supporting government officials who limit government pension investments in such funds, and by considering corporate managers’ harmful actions when choosing products like those of Anheuser-Busch InBev, Target, and Disney. 3. Assess government people by how fully they use their constitutional powers against others in government and cronies. Government people are delegated powers through their jurisdictions’ charters. Government people’s powers are strikingly asymmetric. Government people have no lawful powers to defy the Constitution but awesome lawful powers and duties to support the Constitution. If government people use their lawful powers to limit only themselves, we need supermajorities before this will secure our freedoms. But if any government person also uses his lawful powers to limit others, then each single executive, bloc of legislators, or judge better secures our freedoms. Many politicians have much to say about what other people should do and are eager to do other people’s jobs, but they don’t do their own jobs. The only things politicians say or do that are worth supporting are actions to use constitutional powers to limit others in government and cronies. 4. Vote strategically for constitutionalists in Republican primaries and in general elections. Keep Republican Progressives from returning in subsequent elections as hard-to-dislodge incumbents. Register as a Republican if needed to vote, and in primaries vote for the most constitutionalist Republicans. In general elections, vote for the most constitutionalist candidates from any party. If you build support, more will follow. If a Progressive Democrat wins for the time being, others in the various branches and jurisdictions have the power and duty to undo any damage he might do. Of these others, Republicans are the only people who might limit Progressive Democrats; and Republican Progressives don’t. Wherever there’s unmitigated damage, Republican Progressives are the people we must hold accountable. 5. Support partial secessions of county regions from legacy state governments and of neighborhood regions from legacy city governments. The Constitution has a rule that the national government shall guarantee to each state ¾ really, to each state’s residents ¾ a republican form of government. A given government can assuredly be republican only if its charter has the same rules and sanctions as the Constitution. In state, county, and city charters, the ratifiers echo the Constitution’s design features but then layer on incompatible scope and administrative states. No state constitutions delegate only limited, enumerated powers. Just as state delegates ratified the Constitution in the USA, county delegates can ratify county-region constitutions within each state, and neighborhood delegates can ratify neighborhood-region constitutions within their cities. Compared to when the USA seceded from Great Britain, this is simpler. Now each region’s delegates can copy the Constitution. Also, now these delegates will be implementing the explicit governing law ¾ the Constitution ¾ whereas the legacy states or cities clearly aren’t. 6. Support a good party. Our fundamental political and therefore economic problem in our system of two major parties is that both are majority Progressive. If the economy is viewed as a process, then governments are impactful controls. If governments are viewed as processes, then parties are the key controls. Where the Constitution is designed to limit governments, party rules are designed to empower party organizations. For a good party, like for a seceding county region or neighborhood region, the Constitution is a model design solution. It’s ready-built and well examined. The fundamental solution is to build at least one major party with a party constitution that limits the party’s power. A good party will use a party constitution and complementary party laws to enact candidate selection processes that favor constitutionalist candidates. We can build a good party any of multiple ways: elect a president who uses his constitutional powers, partially secede from state governments, start neighborhood voter information meetings, take control of the Republican Party. Fail to fix at least one party, and no other solution will be sufficient — Not term limits, not other constitutional amendments. Fix at least one party, and its people will make quick, lasting work of the remaining problems. The more effectively that prosocial individuals use their powers, the more quickly that all people will live in increased freedom.

Antisocial people run in packs. They exert concentrated power, but they are decidedly in the minority. Prosocial people operate individualistically, but in the aggregate, they have much-greater power. Prosocial people can be defeated only by themselves. Many familiar practices don’t utilize power effectively. Some new practices also wouldn’t. Use power effectively these 6 ways: 1. Worship, love, and save. Individual faith in Christ limits the envy that stymies economic growth. Individual faith also strengthens lesser magistrates to limit greater magistrates, which secures individuals’ rights. Love is disciplined action that builds healthy relationships. Saving builds productivity. 2. Choose assets, and consumer products, whose producers do the least harm. Stocks provide the greatest long-term returns of any single class of investment. Choosing stocks in normal times, but choosing gold instead in crisis times, provides even-greater long-term returns. In normal times that include routine government-money-error cycles, stocks provide the greatest returns. In crisis times, when money producers have been more greatly inflating the money quantity, and more greatly suppressing profits, gold shelters assets and provides better returns. Shopping for the best added value is the key ingredient that makes voluntary cooperation select for the producers that add the most value. But this added value can give fund managers and corporate managers the power and control to pursue ends that harm everyone. Individuals can limit such harms by moving their investments out of funds like those of BlackRock and Vanguard, by supporting government officials who limit government pension investments in such funds, and by considering corporate managers’ harmful actions when choosing products like those of Anheuser-Busch InBev, Target, and Disney. 3. Assess government people by how fully they use their constitutional powers against others in government and cronies. Government people are delegated powers through their jurisdictions’ charters. Government people’s powers are strikingly asymmetric. Government people have no lawful powers to defy the Constitution but awesome lawful powers and duties to support the Constitution. If government people use their lawful powers to limit only themselves, we need supermajorities before this will secure our freedoms. But if any government person also uses his lawful powers to limit others, then each single executive, bloc of legislators, or judge better secures our freedoms. Many politicians have much to say about what other people should do and are eager to do other people’s jobs, but they don’t do their own jobs. The only things politicians say or do that are worth supporting are actions to use constitutional powers to limit others in government and cronies. 4. Vote strategically for constitutionalists in Republican primaries and in general elections. Keep Republican Progressives from returning in subsequent elections as hard-to-dislodge incumbents. Register as a Republican if needed to vote, and in primaries vote for the most constitutionalist Republicans. In general elections, vote for the most constitutionalist candidates from any party. If you build support, more will follow. If a Progressive Democrat wins for the time being, others in the various branches and jurisdictions have the power and duty to undo any damage he might do. Of these others, Republicans are the only people who might limit Progressive Democrats; and Republican Progressives don’t. Wherever there’s unmitigated damage, Republican Progressives are the people we must hold accountable. 5.

Title: Bitcoin: Will $1.12B whale sell-off fuel BTC’s slide toward $88K?

Bitcoin traded in the red for eight consecutive days amid intense selling pressure from holders. Aggressive selling by whales, miners, and institutions has intensified downward pressure on BTC’s price. The SMI Ergodic Oscillator and RVI both signal persistent bearish momentum and rising volatility. Since falling below the $100,000 mark, Bitcoin [BTC] has remained under that level for eight straight days, a stretch of losses not seen since the post-Liberation Day dip in early April. In fact, at press time, Bitcoin was trading at $92,229, up 0.38% on daily charts. Before these minor gains, BTC had been on a downward trajectory, dropping by 11.03% on weekly charts. Amid this prolonged bearish trend, prominent market players have capitulated and increased their spending significantly. Undoubtedly, BTC has continued to decline amid intense selling pressure from whales and other large entities. According to Checkonchain data, Holder Net Position Change has remained negative through Q4. Source: Checkonchain At the time of writing, this metric had declined to -60.07k BTC, the lowest levels since early August, reflecting intense selling from holders. In fact, Lookonchain observed such selling activity. According to the on-chain monitor, Bitcoin OG Owen Gunden sold all his remaining 2,499 BTC, worth $228 million, via Kraken. The OG has been on an aggressive selling spree, dumping all 11k BTC, worth $1.12 billion, reflecting strong bearish sentiment from him. At the same time, BlackRock deposited another 6,735 BTC, valued at $616 million, into Coinbase Prime, further raising sell-off fears. Coupled with that, Bitcoin miners have also been on a selling spree, offloading 71.9k BTC over the past seven days. Mara Holdings is one such miner. According to Lookonchain, MARA deposited 644 BTC, worth $58.7 million, to FalconX and Coinbase Prime. Source: CryptoQuant Often, miners sell during a dip over thinning margins and are forced to offload to fund operational costs. In total, these three entities have offloaded 9,878 BTC, worth $902.7 million, over the past day. Typically, increased sales from these two groups add more pressure on an already weak market, risking further losses. According to AMBCrypto, Bitcoin’s downtrend has prolonged as it grapples with increased selling from holders. As a result, the SMI Ergodic Oscillator has remained negative for nine consecutive days, settling at -0.03 at press time, indicating sellers’ dominance. Source: TradingView Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s Relative Volatility Index (RVI) has remained below 50 for eight straight days, a level that typically indicates increasing downside volatility and strengthening bearish momentum. Given these conditions, BTC remains vulnerable to further losses. If selling pressure persists alongside rising volatility, Bitcoin could dip below the $90,000 mark once again. Should the $88,000 support level break, the next key support lies near $86,482. To reverse this bearish outlook, BTC would need a daily close above $93,428.

Title: Bitwise XRP ETF sees $21.7M turnover on debut but closes the day lower
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/bitwise-xrp-etf-sees-21-7m-turnover-on-debut-but-closes-the-day-lower/
Time Published: 2025-11-20T23:30:15Z
Full Content:
The Bitwise XRP ETF posted $21.7M in turnover on 20 November, but will it match-up with Canary’s XRPC? The Bitwise XRP ETF reported $21.7 million in turnover, with 1.13 million shares traded, but closed 7% lower at $22.46 after opening at $24.15. Canary’s XRPC controls $268.88M in assets with $292.61M in cumulative inflows since launch, while still recording $15.82M in fresh inflows on 19 November. Finviz data shows the XRP ETF opened at $24.15, traded between $24.15 and $22.12, and closed at $22.46—reflecting a 7% decline from the opening print. Total dollar volume reached approximately $26 million, indicating significant participation from active traders and market makers. Source: Finviz According to data from Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart, three hours before the market close, the Bitwise XRP saw $21.7 million in turnover, with more than 1.13 million shares traded. The launch marks the second U.S. spot XRP ETF to hit the market, arriving one week after Canary Funds’ XRPC. Bitwise enters a competitive landscape where Canary’s XRPC has already captured $292.61 million in cumulative inflows. SoSoValue data shows XRPC controls $268.88 million in total net assets, representing 0.22% of XRP’s market cap. The fund recorded $15.82 million in net inflows on 19 November alone, demonstrating sustained institutional demand days after its initial launch. Despite arriving second, Seyffart described Bitwise’s turnover as “impressive.” Valkyrie CIO Steven McClurg congratulated Bitwise on the launch, noting that strong first-day activity proves “you don’t have to be BlackRock to launch a top ETF.” The ETF’s price action tracked broader crypto market weakness throughout the day. XRP’s underlying spot market experienced volatility, and the ETF traded in line with those movements. The decline into the close raises questions about whether institutional investors allocated fresh capital on Day 1 or whether activity came primarily from secondary-market trading. Official flow figures will only become available after the next settlement cycle, when authorized participants and issuers publish updated fund holdings. Platforms including SoSoValue, Farside Investors, and Bloomberg Terminal will reflect this data on 21 November. Bitwise positioned the ETF as a low-fee option for U.S.-regulated XRP exposure. Tomorrow’s data will reveal whether strong trading interest translated into meaningful institutional allocations that can compete with Canary’s head start.

Title: Here’s How High The XRP Price Needs To Be To Flip Bitcoin

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. The conversation around XRP has grown louder in recent months as the asset continues to gain traction through ecosystem growth, Spot XRP ETFs, and market interest. Despite this momentum, XRP still sits far below Bitcoin, the industry’s dominant cryptocurrency, when comparing total valuation. That gap raises a simple question: how high would the XRP price need to climb in order to actually flip Bitcoin? Data from MarketCapOf provides a direct, real-time look at what XRP’s price would be if it matched Bitcoin’s market capitalization today. Although it is currently going through a correction phase, Bitcoin has the largest presence in the crypto market by an overwhelming margin, and its market capitalization currently stands at roughly $1.84 trillion. This valuation ranks Bitcoin among the largest assets on the planet, surpassing many global corporations. XRP, now trading around $2.14 at the time of writing, holds a market cap of approximately $128.7 billion. This means Bitcoin’s valuation is more than fourteen times larger than XRP’s. For XRP to flip Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency would need to rise to the same market capitalization that Bitcoin currently holds. Using the circulating supply of XRP, MarketCapOf calculates how much each XRP token would be worth if it matched Bitcoin’s market cap. Based on the latest data, XRP would need to trade at $30.61 for its total valuation to equal Bitcoin’s. This is the current “flippening price,” and it reflects the direct ratio between their two market caps. To reach the level of Bitcoin’s all-time high market cap of $2.485 trillion recorded on October 6, XRP would need to climb to about $41.26 per token. The calculation highlights how far ahead Bitcoin still is. XRP sits at roughly seven percent of Bitcoin’s total valuation, meaning the asset would need to appreciate more than fourteen times from its current level to stand on equal footing. In simple terms, an investor holding 1,000 XRP would see their position shift from about $2,140 today to more than $30,000 if the token were priced at $30.61. This comparison does not assume any change in circulating supply, tokenomics, or macro factors. It is a clean and direct valuation exercise based purely on market capitalization. However, even in its simplicity, it shows the scale of inflows required for XRP to close the gap and flip Bitcoin’s dominance in the cryptocurrency rankings. Recent months have seen stronger activity in the Ripple ecosystem, most especially with new partnerships and acquisitions by Ripple. Added to this is the expanding conversation around Spot XRP ETFs, which many analysts believe could introduce significant liquidity if major issuers like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale fully enter the space. The newest entrant is Bitwise, which launched its Spot XRP ETF just hours ago.

Title: From Big To Bigger: Abu Dhabi Investment Council Triples Bitcoin ETF Exposure
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/from-big-to-bigger-abu-dhabi-investment-council-triples-bitcoin-etf-exposure/
Time Published: 2025-11-20T22:00:24Z

Abu Dhabi Investment Council nearly tripled its holdings in BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust during the third quarter, growing from about 2.4 million shares to nearly 8 million by September 30. The position was valued at roughly $518 million at quarter end. According to market reports, that build-up happened just before Bitcoin hit new highs in early October, when prices crossed the $125,000 mark. The timing left the fund with a much larger exposure to Bitcoin-linked ETFs right as investor sentiment became far more volatile. A sovereign fund increasing an ETF position by this scale sends a clear message about how some big public investors now see crypto: as an asset class worth holding. That does not mean the bet is risk-free. ETF shares can be redeemed, market swings can be sharp, and paper gains can evaporate quickly when prices reverse. Reports indicate ADIC treated the ETF as a long-term store of value, but short-term price action has already tested that view. JUST IN: 🇦🇪 UAE state fund triples its stake in BlackRock Bitcoin ETF. — Watcher.Guru (@WatcherGuru) November 19, 2025 Spot ETFs then faced heavy redemptions in November. BlackRock’s IBIT recorded a record single-day outflow of about $523 million, marking the largest one-day withdrawal since the ETF launched in January 2024. The outflow was part of a run of redemptions that month and signaled growing caution among some holders. Those redemptions came as bitcoin slid from its October highs. The pullback has left some big buyers holding positions that look less favorable on paper. Some analysts argue these moves—both buying and selling at scale—are part of a normal allocation cycle for institutional investors. Others warn rapid inflows and outflows can magnify price swings for everyone in the market. According to the coverage, ADIC’s increase shows that parts of the global investing community are prepared to use regulated US ETFs to gain bitcoin exposure. That preference for regulated vehicles can increase the pool of buyers in good times, while also creating new pressure points when sentiment shifts and large redemptions occur. A big public fund made a bold move into bitcoin via a major US ETF and did so just before the market cooled. The trade highlights both the growing mainstream interest in crypto and the risks that come with fast moves in and out of large ETF positions. In the meantime, the facts are straightforward: holdings spiked to nearly 8 million IBIT shares worth about $518 million at quarter end, and the ETF later saw a record $523 million single-day outflow as prices fell from early October highs.

Title: Why were stocks down today? What to know as Dow gives up 700-point gain

U.S. stocks whipsawed, with the blue-chip Dow swinging through 1,000 points, before closing lower. Bolstered by strong earnings from artificial intelligence chip giant Nvidia and discount retailer Walmart, stocks opened higher and the Dow climbed 700 points. However, stocks slowly started losing ground after the delayed September jobs report appeared to dash hopes for another rate cut when the Federal Reserve meets next month. At the close, the Dow was down 386.51 points, or 0.84%, at 45,752.26. The tech-heavy Nasdaq ended down 486.181 points, or 2.16%, at 22,078.048 and the broad S&P 500 dropped 103.40 points, or 1.56%, to 6,538.76. The benchmark 10-year yield slipped to 4.098%. The employment report, originally due in early October but delayed because of the 43-day government shutdown, showed 119,000 jobs added in September and the unemployment rate inching up a tenth to 4.4%. The data were much better than the 51,000 new jobs some economists had expected, but job gains for July and August were revised down by 33,000, making the picture more mixed. "Given the Fed's recent hawkish shift and the lack of official data scheduled before (its Dec. 10 meeting), it is understandable that the market thinks the next move won't come until early 2026," wrote James Knightley, chief international economist at Dutch bank ING. The CME Fedwatch tool, which measures the chances investors see for a rate move, show a nearly 40% chance for a rate cut in December. Despite recent hype of an AI bubble, many analysts said they don't see it. "This question of a bubble being suggested by some is easy to refute," said Nancy Tengler, chief executive and chief investment officer at Laffer Tengler Investments. "After all, after the headlines settle, stocks ultimately trade on earnings." And Nvidia proved its earnings chops, analysts said. "NVIDIA is miles ahead of any competition in the space with a huge knowledge and intellectual property moat," said Mark Malek, chief investment officer at Siebert Financial. "Whether it was by plan or happenstance, NVIDIA has the right product for the right moment...NVIDIA earnings were not just good, they were a loud 'told you so.'" In fact, corporate earnings were strong across the board, said Kristy Akullian, head of iShares investment strategy for the Americas at BlackRock. "Heading into third quarter, analysts expected just 6% earnings growth," she said. "Now that Nvidia released earnings...we can firmly report that actual results came in more than double that, marking the strongest quarter" since the last three months of 2021. Uncertainty is the stock market's worst friend, analysts said. Even with Nvidia's results calming some of the AI bubble talk, the outlook is still cloudy, they said. "Investors looking for an explanation for the current market pullback should look no further than the recent uncertainties that have resurfaced," said Bret Kenwell, U.S. investment analyst at trading platform eToro. "Questions around the Fed’s interest-rate path, labor market, legal ruling on tariffs, and government shutdown are just a few of them. Markets don’t like uncertainty, and when it rises, we often see volatility as a result." The biggest issue, he said, is the market's flying blind on the health of the economy. "Not only did investors and the Fed have to forgo most major economic reports for more than a month, the incomplete picture we’re receiving makes it difficult to get an accurate view of the economy," Kenwell said. The government said it wouldn't release an October jobs report ever because no data were collected last month due to the shutdown. No one can say for certain if the market will rally again soon, but stocks have history on its side. The market's entering "what’s typically a seasonally strong stretch," Kenwell said. Historically, stocks rally at the end of the year, spawning the phrase "Santa Claus rally." The Dow has risen 77% of the time from the day after Christmas through the first two trading days of January. The S&P 500 has had a positive return in this period 79% of the time since 1950, with an average return of 1.3%. Medora Lee is a money, markets and personal finance reporter at USA TODAY.

Title: Private Credit Becomes Core as JPMorgan Rethinks 60/40 Model

Private credit and opportunistic debt strategies should be treated as essential, not optional, the firm says. November 20, 2025 (Bloomberg) -- JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s asset management arm is pitching private markets as essential ballast to investor portfolios amid stretched stock valuations and unreliable bond hedges. With stock gains increasingly driven by a handful of large caps and bonds potentially offering less protection in downturns, the traditional 60/40 portfolio mix needs reinforcement, the $4 trillion asset manager said in its 2026 investment outlook. Private credit, so-called secondaries — markets where limited partners can sell their stakes to other institutions — and opportunistic debt strategies should be treated as essential, not optional, the firm says. “A key reason for having bonds in a portfolio is that they are supposed to zag when stocks zig. But if stocks zig and bonds zig too, then you lose the diversification benefit from diversification into bonds,” said David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management. “This is where alternatives come in.” Private credit is the centerpiece of JPMorgan’s view, with strategists pointing to its “healthy premium” over public debt. But they also highlight the need for range of investments as ways to build resilience if growth slows. Read more: Private Credit Leans on Secondaries as Investor Payouts Dwindle Related:AssetMark Adds Private Markets to its Platform Wall Street has proposed tweaks to 60/40 for years — adding commodities, real estate and even crypto to investment strategies. But the recent surge of institutional flows into private markets signals something more permanent. What once lived at the edges of a portfolio is now being folded into its foundation. The shift isn’t without controversy. Critics warn that some of the benefits — from diversification to downside protection — may not hold when markets come under pressure. Liquidity gaps and opaque pricing remain key concerns as more capital moves in. Still, JPMorgan’s “60/40+” framing captures a broader turn: The old playbook hasn’t been discarded, but it is being rewritten — this time around assets that used to sit on the sidelines. Kelly argues that investors can reallocate to alternatives by trimming both stocks and bonds in line with their original 60/40 split — preserving balance while shifting portfolio structure. “Investors can fund a 10% position or a 20% position or a 30% position in alternatives proportionately from the 60% stocks, 40% bonds and just make each of those slices smaller,” Kelly added. “And if they do that, we think it gives better diversification, more stability in the portfolio going forward.” Related:Q&A: Is a Private Market Tokenization Revolution Coming?

Still, concerns over concentrated and highly valued public AI equities — such as the Magnificent 7 comprising some 35% of the S&P 500 and the index’s forward P/E reaching 23x — are pushing some investors toward alternative assets with lower market correlation. “Everyone’s very excited about AI and, indeed, we are excited about AI, too,” Kelly said. “But the question is: Does AI justify the valuations of all of these huge megacap companies, or is it going to be a day of reckoning? Chances are, eventually, something will go wrong and there will be a day of reckoning.” Looking ahead, artificial intelligence remains a central theme as the technology shifts from so-called proofs-of-concept to large-scale adoption.

For instance, the outlook cites how massive hyperscaler spending is effectively channeling value from public to private markets, where private equity, infrastructure and private credit funds are driving the build-outs.As for the broader economy, Kelly does not foresee a recession in the year ahead, though he admits that worries about the outlook continue to persist.

Presently he works as Director of Energy Security and Supply Chains, at Strategy… More Info The outcome of the visit of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to Washington, including his meeting with Trump and his entire entourage, has been successful, at least by media reporting. The impact of all is still to be seen, but from the start, MBS’s visit not just rebooted a strained political relationship. The primary outcome, based on all, is that it has reset the economic core of the US–Saudi partnership around Aramco. While the largest oil company in the world had already found its place in global power projections, Aramco has now become the principal vehicle for turning headline investment promises into hard assets, contracts, and code. Though 2025 isn’t over yet, Aramco’s multibillion-dollar dealmaking spree with the United States has already reached staggering levels. In May 2025, the oil company had already unveiled 34 preliminary agreements with US companies worth up to $90 billion, encompassing a wide range of projects, including LNG, refinery upgrades, AI, advanced materials, and finance. The latter is now followed by another 17 MOUs, adding another $30 billion in potential projects, from LNG and manufacturing to services procurement. If you take both figures together, it shows clearly that the Saudi pledge to raise total investments is now anchored at around $1 trillion. Analysts should understand that these levels of financial commitments are no longer just about crude exports and arms sales; the message has become different. It represents a multi-layered energy, technology, and supply-chain bargain that puts Aramco at the center, with geopolitics written into it in capitals. For decades, Aramco’s main asset in the USA has been Motiva in Port Arthur, Texas. Its role is clear: Motiva has completed a debottlenecking that makes Port Arthur the largest refinery in the US, capable of processing about 654,000 bpd. Aramco indicated in May 2025 that it will invest another $3.4 billion to further integrate the refinery into a larger petrochemicals and fuels complex. The current moves made by Saudi Arabia and Aramco show, however, a sweeping change from crude oil to American-made supply chain products, as these downstream dollars sit alongside a sweeping web of MOUs with US industrial and service champions: At the same time, the Kingdom and Aramco have set their sights on access to US financial services and capital markets. Both are already showing results, as seen in the agreements with PIMCO, State Street, Wellington, and Wall Street banks, including BlackRock and Goldman Sachs. The main moves are to create dedicated vehicles, such as a “Fund of One,” to channel Saudi capital into US infrastructure and transition assets. The 'Fund of One' is a financial mechanism that enables Saudi Arabia to invest its capital directly in specific US projects, thereby supporting the US economy and safeguarding its long-term interests. Related: New Iraqi Leadership Confronts Water Shortage and Economic Strain While most are focusing on the synergies between US President Trump and his Saudi counterpart, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the Kingdom's underlying strategic moves are guided by the well-known Saudi Vision 2030. Riyadh uses all projects and arrangements to lock in technology, services, and financing, mainly meant for local Saudi Vision 2030 projects. At the same time, these moves are diversifying Aramco’s earnings away from pure upstream oil, showcasing the company's adaptability. The Trump Administration, at the same time, wants to keep Saudi Arabia, one of the world’s most prominent investors and energy suppliers, deeply entangled in the US industrial base amid growing competition with China. The most strategic moves are seen in the LNG sphere. The Saudi oil giant is pursuing a clear gas pivot, while the USA sees it as an export machine. This shift has significant geopolitical implications, as it not only changes the dynamics of the global gas trade but also impacts the energy security strategies of both Saudi Arabia and the USA. Again, geopolitics, economics, and strategy are merging. Natural gas is the most strategic part of all. Saudi Arabia’s leading revenue maker, Aramco, has slowly but steadily repositioned itself from an oil-only behemoth toward becoming a serious LNG player. US export capacity has been assessed and approved as one of its main springboards. LNG markets have been woken up since April 2025 by Saudi moves, following the signing of a 20-year sale-and-purchase agreement by a subsidiary of Aramco with NextDecade. The latter SPA entails the delivery of 1.2 Mtpa of LNG from Train 4 of the Rio Grande project in Texas. According to current info, the project’s first phase is already under construction, with full build-out expected to cost around $18 billion. A year earlier, in June 2024, Aramco had already struck a heads-of-agreement with Sempra Infrastructure for 5 Mtpa of LNG offtake from the Port Arthur LNG Phase 2 expansion. The HOA also includes an option to take a 25 percent equity stake. Since May 2025, Aramco has been framing these commitments, 6.2 Mtpa initially, holding an ambition to reach 7.5 Mtpa by 2030. For the Saudis, these deals are seen as the backbone of a global gas portfolio that complements their oil exports. On the geopolitical stage, these deals and strategies are doing three things: Trump is also looking at a significant win, as Saudi capital and contracts will support US LNG expansion. This will significantly enhance Washington's power to lock in long-term influence over the global gas trade, a testament to the weight of these strategic moves. Another significant issue should also be addressed, linked to a combination of supply chains, critical minerals, and de-risking from China. Both parties have been very subtle in their moves to rewire supply chains away from Chinese dominance. Already at the broader US–Saudi Investment Forum, both parties have flagged agreements not only in energy but also in critical minerals and industrial inputs central to batteries, renewables, and advanced manufacturing. The goals of Aramco in this regard are clear; they want to secure long-term access to catalysts, metals, control systems, and specialized equipment that underpin both conventional and low-carbon projects. Washington’s goal is to ensure that a key Middle Eastern partner sources more of its strategic inputs from American or allied producers rather than from Chinese suppliers, as Trump seeks to counter or mitigate Beijing's growing influence in the Kingdom. For both parties, it is a form of mutual de-risking. The need for supply-chain interdependence matters to both. While Washington wants to block China, Riyadh wants the option to arbitrage between US, European, and Asian suppliers. Current Aramco-led deals are effectively creating a new layer of sunk-cost interdependence. If in place, these will make a sharp political rupture more expensive for both capitals. Overall, energy and AI are also explicitly fused into the relationship. Both countries have announced a US–Saudi AI Strategic Partnership aimed at making the Kingdom a “global AI leader.” Washington is reportedly considering approving the first sales of advanced AI chips to the Saudi venture Humain. The latter would open a controlled channel for high-end semiconductors into the Kingdom. Again, Aramco plays a pivotal role in all of this. In recent months, Aramco has already announced partnerships with Nvidia for AI and robotics infrastructure, AWS for cloud and environmental digitalization, and Qualcomm for advanced industrial connectivity. The geopolitical cloud is very relevant, as AI will give Aramco an operational edge, especially by enabling it to model reservoirs more effectively, optimize production and trading, and monitor infrastructure for cyber and physical threats. Again, the Kingdom’s role as the world’s default swing producer and system stabilizer is at play. The Saudi-US tech stack will also serve as a counterweight to Chinese solutions from firms like Huawei. Washington will also gain export control leverage, as it retains the ability to tighten or loosen access to advanced chips and cloud services. This will increase US leverage on Saudi decision-making, this time outside of oil and gas. It is also part of a new systemology that complements or substitutes for traditional defense and arms sales tools. Aramco’s main AI goal is not only focused on efficiency but also on gaining access to US-centered digital ecosystems. Beijing, as the leading competitor, will certainly notice this new alignment. International media have been discussing, especially, nuclear energy, defense, and security. Trump has clearly framed the broader package as a historic deepening of economic and defense ties, highlighting up to $1 trillion in prospective Saudi spending that spans nuclear energy, F-35 fighter jets, advanced chips, and energy investments. A Saudi-US civilian nuclear deal, worth several billions of dollars, was also signed after years of slow negotiations. Washington has clearly indicated that it wants Saudi nuclear and AI development to happen under American, not Beijing’s, umbrella. Even though Aramco is not a defense company, all its deals cannot be separated from the security architecture surrounding them, including oil and gas security, infrastructure hardening, and gas as a strategic commodity. Reality is again that all of the latter amounts to a renewed oil-for-security bargain. The only change is that it has been set up in a much more complex form: crude plus LNG, plus AI and chips, backed by US naval power and advanced weapons. Optimism is high, but….the proof is in the eating of the pudding, or maybe in this case, a bowl of Umm Ali. The MOUs will need to move from paper-based to hard assets. It is still to be seen how much of the $120 billion in Aramco MOUs will materialize into contracts, equity stakes, or shovel-ready projects. At the same time, will there be more or deeper US equity in Saudi projects? As Saudi Arabia opens more upstream and downstream assets to international capital – from gas fields to petrochemical complexes – US firms could seek larger equity stakes. Washington will push for this to balance the substantial positions held by Chinese and other Asian companies. Nuclear will be a long-term project; assessments will be needed. At the same time, all deals will be affected by political risk in both capitals. On the sidelines of all, but not to be forgotten, GCC countries will be assessing the changes too. Qatar and the UAE will be reassessing their relative positions towards the USA and within their existing bilateral relations. Saudi Arabia will be seeking a more prominent position, perhaps at Qatar's expense. As stated before, the situation is in flux and moving to different levels. When looking at the US-Saudi relationship, current moves are not a nostalgic return to the 1970s oil-for-bases deal, but a 21st-century variant in which Aramco serves as the hinge between hydrocarbons, LNG, digital infrastructure, and security. Washington will use its LNG-AI-high-end manufacturing links to ensure that a critical Gulf power stays within the Western strategic orbit and helps underwrite Atlantic energy security in an era of great-power rivalry. Riyadh’s position is clear: by locking in US infrastructure, chips, capital, and naval protection, it buys not only insurance for its own diversification but also supports Aramco’s transition from a pure oil major to a broader energy-and-technology platform. The coming months and years will depend on whether both sides can manage the inevitable frictions (human rights, regional wars, OPEC+ policy, or China) without lunging into a position of weaponizing the very interdependence they are now deepening. If successful, the Aramco-led wave of deals could mark the beginning of a more stable, if more complex, US–Saudi compact. In case of a significant failure, markets will need to understand that the same network of LNG contracts, AI clouds, and supply-chain ties will become the terrain on which the next phase of geopolitical competition is fought. For current developments, a clearer option exists: the personal relationship between MBS and Trump, two transactional powers holding options to change a region. As long as both sides can prevent a Zelensky situation, positive results can be made.

Private credit lenders are poised to take control of pallet company 48Forty Solutions, about a year after providing $1.75 billion of debt to support Summit Partners’ acquisition of the business, according to people with knowledge of the matter. A group of lenders including Antares Capital are set to take equity in 48Forty under a proposed restructuring slated to close by the end of the year, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private information. Other lenders include KKR & Co., BlackRock Inc. and Carlyle Group Inc., the people said. The deal would shed about $1 billion of liabilities from 48Forty’s balance sheet as lenders swap their debt for a stake, the people said. As part of the proposal, lenders including Antares will inject around $75 million of new debt into 48Forty, they said. Representatives for Antares, KKR, BlackRock and Carlyle declined to comment. 48Forty and Summit didn’t respond to requests for comment. In cases where borrowers are struggling with their liabilities, private credit firms are more frequently swapping their debt positions for equity stakes to try and prevent losses. While swaps can produce upside, they also offer more unpredictable returns than direct loans, which are designed to provide stable income over time. Lenders proposed a debt restructuring for 48Forty earlier this year. The company, which was already paying the majority of the interest on its debt in kind, stopped paying interest in August, according to the people. FS KKR Capital Corp., a fund jointly managed by KKR and Future Standard, marked down the value of a loan to 48Forty to about 46 cents on the dollar in the third quarter, from around 86 cents a year ago, according to a filing. With the restructuring, plans to cut costs could include shuttering multiple pallet recycling plants, the people said, though no decision on closures has been made. 48Forty, which provides recycled wood pallets and pallet management services across the US and Canada, currently has 73 plants, according to its website. Lenders are also looking to appoint a new board for the company, the people said. Antares and KKR will each have two appointments, while Carlyle and BlackRock will jointly agree on one appointment, and first-lien lenders will all agree on another, they said. The last board seat will be reserved for the company’s chief executive officer. ©2025 Bloomberg L.P. This article was generated from an automated news agency feed without modifications to text.
