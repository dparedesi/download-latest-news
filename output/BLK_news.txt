Posted on 11/21/2024 6:00:12 PM PST by hardspunned The Russian Ministry of Defense has developed a forecast for the evolution of the global military-political situation until 2045, which includes the elimination of Ukraine and its division into parts. Moscow may transmit this plan to the United States through diplomatic channels, according to the Interfax-Ukraine agency. How Russia’s plan looks The first part, according to the Russian plan, involves the so-called new regions of Russia. This refers to the Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, Kherson regions, and Crimea with Sevastopol, which are to officially become part of the Russian Federation. This is the focus of Moscow today. The second part, according to agency sources, is the pro-Russian state formation. This concerns the creation of a "state" with pro-Russian authorities in the territories of the city of Kyiv, the Kyiv, Chernihiv, Sumy, Kharkiv, Poltava, Kirovohrad, Dnipropetrovsk, Odesa, Cherkasy, Vinnytsia, and Zhytomyr regions. This "state formation" will reject European and Euro-Atlantic integration and will agree to a Russian military presence, following the example of Transnistria, Abkhazia, and South Ossetia. The third part involves the disputed territories in western Ukraine. These are the Volhynia, Rivne, Khmelnytskyi, Lviv, Ivano-Frankivsk, Ternopil, Chernivtsi, and Zakarpattia regions, which the Kremlin plans to divide with neighboring Hungary, Poland, and Romania.

Good luck selling all that nonsense to Trump, Rooski. >> Nope, the Ukes continued the war ukes — an alias for NATO & NGOs Trump is not going to go for that. He’ll give Ukraine more weapons, even long-range missiles until Putin is ready to negotiate. Here’s my alternative plan. Putin takes his wanna be commie butt out of Ukraine, and then pays Ukraine reparations for all the damage it has done. Good news finally. Ukraine belongs in the bosom of Mother Russia. It’ll be a done deal BEFORE 1/20/25. You think Trump will start WWIII to retake the Russian city of Odessa just to give it back to Blackrock? Maybe you and your fellow travelers think that might be a good idea but Trump and our fellow travelers don’t. Where are you getting these Russian propaganda talking points? Putin has been trying his best to take Ukrainian territory. The story of Ukraine killing ethnic Russians is pure myth. Ukraine passed the law required by Minsk that would have given autonomy to Donbas and was in the process of conducting the required referendum. It was Russia who violated Minsk by not withdrawing its forces, by not handing over the border to Ukraine, and by blocking Ukraine's referendum, all required by Minsk.All the Ukes had to do was to abide by the negotiated Istanbul peace accords and Ukraine would have gotten everything but Crimea back. There was no negotiated agreement at Istanbul, Russia's demands were too high. Nor had Russia agreed to withdraw from the territory that it occupied.Putin will stop today with what he has and a neutral Ukraine. Putin rejected this proposal by Turkey. Putin has publicly declared that he will start negotiations only after Ukraine withdraws from the rest of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzia.

Putin has publicly declared that he will start negotiations only after Ukraine withdraws from the rest of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzia. And it is that attitude, not NATO membership or any the host of other rationalizations that Russia has given, which is driving this war. Unfortunately for Russia and its fanboys, Ukrainians are no longer willing to be under Russian subjugation. Even if Putin could force this ridiculous dream scenario, all it would do would be to give Russia an unending guerrilla war that would bleed Russia dry. The days of the Russian Empire are over. Sorry, but isn't it an axiom, rather than an attitude? As a bystander who has observed many of Mr. Trump's actions over the years, and who has also observed many of you're posts here, I will simply say that Mr. Trump does not appear to depend on "SLAVA UKRAINI!!!" for his personal identity and sense of self-esteem, to the extent that you apparently do. He may therefore conduct negotiations a bit differently than you might...;^) ;^) Headline is confusing. Although the underlying story is dumb. Russia creates plan for division of Ukraine and may offer it to USA - Media First read it looks like that Russia would give The Ukraine to the US. It is just some plan they are going to give to the US. Not sure why they would single out the US for reception of their plan. I bet Trump and Putin are already communicating. And despite all the silly talk they will make the decisions. NATO without the USA isn’t ready for war and isn’t a player. NATO expansion is non-negotiable. The Russian ruble is collapsing in value, no longer worth even a penny, and still dropping. It has lost 2/3rds of its value in only two years. The Russian Central Bank Chief reported to the Duma this week that they are out of resources. The old Soviet Arsenal is nearing complete exhaustion. Russia’s largest refineries are having to shut down, as Russian oil industry revenues have continued dropping significantly five months in a row. Putin has scuttled Russia beyond repair. They need a bailout, and China is not going to do it, while they have problems of their own. The jig is up. Unfortunately, the Ukrainians do not share your view and have shown that they will fight for their independence from Russia. Do you really support the subjugation of the Ukrainian people by Russia? Actually I doubt that for two reasons. The first is that he would not want to get tangled up with the charge of illegal negotiations. Second, I would think that he would want to hold his cards close to his vest until he has the power to enforce them. One for you, nineteen for me. Lennon-McCartney rule.

Title: ezmsg-blackrock added to PyPI
URL: https://pypi.org/project/ezmsg-blackrock/
Time Published: 2024-11-22T00:22:35Z
Full Content:
pip install ezmsg-blackrock Copy PIP instructions Released: Nov 22, 2024 Blackrock Cerebus ecosystem interface for ezmsg Interface for Blackrock Cerebus ecosystem (incl. Neuroport) using pycbsdk pip install git+https://github.com/CerebusOSS/ezmsg-blackrock IMPORTANT NOTE: pycbsdk is only compatible with Central Neuroport/Cerebus Suite/NSP Firmware 7.0.5+, built using cbhwlib/hardware library/network protocol 3.11+. Anything older is not supported by pycbsdk. Check this requirement in Central by navigating to Help > About Central Blackrock Neuroport/Cerebus uses UDP multicast traffic to deliver upwards of 30000 packets/sec of data with low latency. There are better ways to do this now, but back when this hardware was made, the engineers were dealing with the limitations of the hardware they had. UDP comes with no packet delivery guarantee, but dropped packets can be catastrophic when interfacing with the Blackrock hardware. As such, do your best to locate the highest quality networking equipment you can find, and have a high tolerance for blaming ethernet adapters and/or your router/switch for errors during troubleshooting. The NSP startup procedure involves blasting several thousand UDP packets from the NSP to the interfacing computer in a few milliseconds. Many low-quality adapters and network switches will simply drop some of these UDP packets, but this will result in errors during startup. This setup describes a setup with a Legacy NSP, a Windows PC (called "Central PC") running Central Suite that can configure the NSP, and a third machine (Windows, MacOS, or Linux) that will be running ezmsg-blackrock, henceforth forward referred to as the "Client PC". The documentation highlights the differences when using Blockrock's newer ("Gemini") NSP and Hubs. Central cannot run on the same PC simultaneously as ezmsg-blackrock because pycbsdk exclusively binds the port that central would use to communicate with the NSP. The NSP has too many settings to implement in ezmsg-blackrock, so in practice, we use Central to configure the NSP then acquire live data thereafter. If you want to, you can use ezmsg-blackrock on the Central PC once you've configured the NSP and closed Central. When you do this, the Central PC and the Client PC are the same PC/IP address. Its assumed that this PC is running windows because Central Suite is only available on Windows. Find the highest quality ethernet (yes, wired) network switch or router that you can. Look for 1+ Gigabit speed ratings (2.5 Gigabit better, 10 Gigabit is best), and features like QoS (Quality of Service) that can guarantee packet delivery. Ensure both the Central PC and the Client PC have high quality ethernet network adapters. Not every ethernet adapter will work, due to packet buffering requirements. High quality ethernet cables are also important; aim for Cat6E or better. It is possible to emulate Blackrock hardware while playing back previously recorded data using a software tool called "nPlayServer". The publicly-available and supported nPlayServer is only available on Windows but unsupported Mac and Linux binaries (x86 or ARM) are available. Open an issue to ask. If your intention is to only test on 'localhost' (i.e., ezmsg-blackrock and nPlayServer on the same machine), then there is nothing more to be done. However, if your intention is for the emulation PC to be a different machine than the client PC, nPlayServer must be configured to work over the network. 0.2.2 Nov 22, 2024 0.2.1 Nov 22, 2024 0.2.0 Nov 22, 2024 0.1.0 Nov 22, 2024 Download the file for your platform.

Title: The Ukraine War Is A War That Should Never Have Happened; Who’s Keeping It Going And Why?

DON'T GET LEFT OUT: HUNTER MUST BE STOPPED! by Rhoda Wilson | Nov 21, 2024 | Coincidence, Conspiracy Fact and Theory, Headline News, War | 0 comments This article was originally published by Rhoda Wilson at The Exposé. “This is a war that should never have happened,” Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said at the beginning of the year. “It’s a war the Russians tried repeatedly to settle on terms that were very very beneficial to Ukraine.” “The big military contractors want to add new countries to NATO all the time,” he said. Why? “Because then that country has to conform its military purchases to NATO weapon specifications which means certain companies … get a trapped market,” he explained. Who Really Profits from the Ukraine War? By Wisdom Land, 2 September 2024 Few people understand what the war in Ukraine means for big business – namely, opportunity. It’s not just the weapons and reconstruction contracts. Ukraine’s vast agricultural lands- among the most fertile in the world – are up for grabs, and American companies like BlackRock are at the front of the line. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. (“RFK Jr.”) deftly and clearly explains. [You can find a copy of the video above published by RFK Jr. on YouTube HERE and a write-up published by Indian news outlet Times Now World HERE.] JP Morgan and BlackRock, along with consultancy McKinsey & Company, are collaborating with the Ukrainian government to establish a reconstruction fund. The objective of this fund is to attract significant investments for the country’s reconstruction, which could cost between $400 billion and $1 trillion, depending on estimates. This fund, known as the Fund for the Development of Ukraine, will use a “blended finance” approach to mobilize both public and private capital, targeting priority sectors such as infrastructure, climate, and agriculture. BlackRock and JP Morgan offered their services pro bono to manage this fund, leveraging their expertise in financial markets and debt management. The intention is that this fund can begin to operate fully once the war ends, although planning is already underway and has been discussed at recent international conferences. The recent partnership between JP Morgan, BlackRock, and McKinsey & Company to rebuild Ukraine highlights the bitter irony of the current geopolitical situation. In a deal that aims to raise hundreds of billions of dollars for the reconstruction of war-torn Ukraine, these American financial giants now position themselves as the economic saviors of a country whose destruction, in part, was facilitated by policies and actions in financial markets that they themselves dominated and shaped. The United States, through its foreign policies and interventions, has a long history of fomenting instability in various regions of the world. In the case of Ukraine, the situation is no different. From the beginning of the Ukrainian crisis, American interests were clear: to weaken Russia and expand the Western sphere of influence. The irony becomes even more evident when we consider that many of the same financial institutions now being called upon to rebuild Ukraine are those that have profited immensely from armed conflicts and the destabilization of global markets. JP Morgan and BlackRock are entities deeply rooted in the global financial system, and both have a history of financing military industries and governments that perpetuate conflict. JP Morgan, for example, has a long history of involvement in financing wars and authoritarian regimes around the world. BlackRock, in turn, as the largest asset manager in the world, has stakes in practically all major defense companies, which profit directly from the manufacture of weapons used in conflicts such as Ukraine. This dichotomy is alarming: the same institutions that financed destruction are now celebrated as leaders of reconstruction. The “fund of reconstruction” proposed for Ukraine is not just a humanitarian effort; it is also a strategic maneuver to ensure that Western capital has control over the country’s future assets and economic infrastructure. The reconstruction of Ukraine, costing up to a trillion dollars, presents a lucrative opportunity for these companies, which are now seen as saviors. Furthermore, McKinsey & Company’s presence on the project adds an additional layer of criticism, as the consulting firm has frequently been accused of unethical practices and collusion with corrupt regimes. McKinsey’s lack of transparency and controversial practices call into question the integrity of the reconstruction process.

We recently compiled a list of the 10 Trending AI Stocks Making Waves Today. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW) stands against the other trending AI stocks that are making waves today. Is artificial intelligence a tool for the rich countries and the wealthy? Even if it is, Chinese President Xi Jinping warns that it shouldn’t be. At the Group of 20 Summit in Rio de Janeiro, Xi noted that AI shouldn’t be a game of the affluent, calling on more international governance and cooperation on the matter. In a separate meeting in Peru, Xi and Joe Biden also agreed that human beings, and not artificial intelligence, should be making decisions about nuclear weapons, as reported by The White House. READ NOW: 10 AI News Stories You Can’t Miss and 15 AI News Making Waves Right Now The call for equitable AI development and responsible decision-making underscores the growing global focus on AI's impact, and all the latest developments being made in the AI realm. As the global race to advance AI accelerates, one country striving to secure its position in this competitive landscape is Japan. The country is reportedly readying a $65-billion push in microchips and artificial intelligence, as revealed by Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba this month. The move comes amid the country’s efforts to reclaim its status as a global tech leader. News like these underscores how artificial intelligence continues to be a dominant theme in the business world. A Cisco 2024 AI Readiness Report reveals how companies around the world realize that the momentum for AI deployment is building fast, pulling up immense pressure on them in the process. However, only 13% of companies are ready to leverage AI and AI-powered technologies to their full potential. This is a 1-point decline from last year. Even though organizations are doing their best to leverage AI, the ROI is nowhere in the picture for many. According to an AI consultant Rider Harris, some major reasons for companies failing to reap ROIs are that they probably invested in a bad tool, they weren’t trained enough (or at all), there’s a lack of excitement on the fear that AI may take their job away, or there may even be a lack of resources for employees to adequately make use of or navigate those tools. This is why focusing on aspects such as training employees, getting them excited about the AI tool, and providing adequate resources can go a long way. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

A cutting-edge computer lab full of IT experts monitoring the security of multiple systems. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 64 Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW) offers AI-driven cybersecurity solutions for all apps, users, and devices. On November 21, TD Cowen analyst Shaul Eyal reiterated a “Buy” rating on Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW) and raised the price target to $420.00. Several factors, such as the company’s impressive financial performance, and strategic growth initiatives, have led to the rating. The company’s next-generation security ARR has surged 40% year-over-year, reaching $4.5 billion. Meanwhile, its RPO has grown 20% to $12.6 billion. These metrics demonstrate the high demand for Palo Alto’s products. Moreover, the company’s focus on platformization on a unified AI-driven platform and product innovations, including Cortex and SASE, is driving substantial growth and paving the way for further opportunities. Overall PANW ranks 7th on our list of the trending AI stocks that are making waves today. While we acknowledge the potential of PANW as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than PANW but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

The first is that these businesses prioritize dividend growth (which means your recurring income will rise), and the second is that it usually means their operations are also growing and in strong financial shape. Visa (NYSE: V), UnitedHealth Group (NYSE: UNH), and FedEx (NYSE: FDX) have all increased their dividend payments by more than 90% in just five years.

Paul Hickey, Bespoke co-founder, together with Dana D'Auria, Envestnet co-chief Investment Officer, joined CNBC's 'Closing Bell: Overtime' on November 12 to discuss the market's reaction to the election results and earnings. Paul Hickey believes that the AI bull market is likely to continue now. This recent conversation centered around the key forces to watch in the current political and economic landscape, particularly in light of potential energy impacts from Ukraine, shifts in Middle Eastern policies, and possible market effects from trade policies with China. Hickey thinks that as President-elect Donald Trump’s cabinet begins to take shape, it will provide clearer insights into future expectations. He emphasized that while election results can lower barriers to the market and reduce speed bumps, their impact is often overstated. He notes that over the past 16 years, the market has shown strong performance under different administrations, with annualized returns of 16.3% during both Barack Obama’s and Donald Trump’s first terms, and 14% under Joe Biden. This consistency, according to Hickey, suggests that market returns have remained relatively stable despite varying political landscapes. The conversation also highlighted the ongoing AI bull market, which has been broadening since the summer and is expected to continue. The S&P 500 recently closed above 6,000, reflecting positive momentum in the markets, including gains in the NASDAQ. There was a discussion about how a sweeping victory for one party could have been perceived as detrimental to equities; however, Republicans achieved this outcome and equities responded positively. To maintain this momentum, D'Auria suggested that Republicans might need to exercise more fiscal responsibility. The implication is that a single party cannot implement all its plans without consideration of fiscal implications. D'Auria thinks that as tax cuts from 2017 are likely to be extended under Republican leadership, inflation concerns may arise due to higher tariffs and increased government spending. The Republican stance thus far has been viewed as pro-business, which is reflected in current market performance. However, a potential challenge lies ahead; she is of the idea that stocks are now being priced with expectations of a low regulatory environment. This regulatory landscape will be crucial for sustaining market growth moving forward. As the market continues to react positively to political developments and the ongoing AI bull market, investors should consider focusing on stocks with significant upside potential. Methodology We sifted through threads to compile a list of 30 trending stocks with high upside potentials. We then selected the 11 stocks with the biggest upside potential according to analysts. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of their analysts' upside potential. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A researcher in a lab coat examining a petri dish of a biopharmaceutical drug. Average Upside Potential as of November 11: 167.76% Altimmune Inc. (NASDAQ:ALT) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company that develops peptide-based therapeutics for obesity and liver diseases. Its lead drug, Pemvidutide, targets obesity and liver inflammation. They are also developing HepTcell, an immunotherapy for chronic hepatitis B. The company reported positive developments for its drug candidate Pemvidutide, a novel GLP-1/glucagon dual agonist in its obesity program, designed to treat obesity and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis. It finished enrolling patients in its Phase 2b IMPACT trial (~190 people). This trial assesses Pemvidutide's effectiveness and safety in treating MASH. Top-line data on the drug's success is expected in the second quarter of 2025. If successful, Pemvidutide could become the first MASH treatment to achieve both reduced liver fat and significant weight loss within 24 weeks. Overall, it has finalized the design of four pivotal Phase 3 trials with the FDA to assess the impact on obesity-related comorbidities. Additionally, data from a Phase 2 study highlighted its ability to reduce body fat by 21.9% while preserving lean muscle mass, especially in older adults. To expand Pemvidutide's potential, the company plans to submit IND applications for up to three additional indications by the end of 2024, with the first trial anticipated to start in H1 2025. Altimmune Inc. (NASDAQ:ALT) is confident that 2025 will be a significant year for Pemvidutide and the company based on the progress made and upcoming milestones. Overall ALT ranks 2nd on our list of the Redditor-approved stocks with biggest upside potential. While we acknowledge the potential of ALT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than ALT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Business FILE PHOTO: Representation of the bitcoin cryptocurrency and a price chart are seen in this illustration taken October 24, 2023. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo (This Nov. 21 story has been corrected to fix the Nov. 12, 2024 entry to remove reference to cryptocurrency market value hitting $3 trillion 'for the first time') Bitcoin neared $100,000 for the first time on Thursday as the election of Republican Donald Trump as president fuelled expectations that his administration will create a friendly regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies. The world's biggest and best-known cryptocurrency has more than doubled from this year's low of $38,505 and is up about 45 per cent in the two weeks since Trump's sweeping election win. Here are key events in bitcoin's journey towards $100,000: 2008: Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonym used by the cryptocurrency's presumed developer, introduces the concept of bitcoin 2010: The first retail transaction takes place when a user pays 10,000 bitcoin for two Papa John's pizzas 2013: As bitcoin's popularity grows, Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, co-founders of crypto exchange Gemini, file their first application with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to create a spot bitcoin ETF. Grayscale Investments launches the Bitcoin Investment Trust, an open-ended private bitcoin trust. 2016: The Winklevoss brothers adjust their application numerous times, such as the exchange on which the product would be traded. They also file amendments naming State Street as administrator. Grayscale files with the SEC to convert its bitcoin trust into a spot bitcoin ETF. 2017: The SEC rejects the Winklevoss application on the grounds bitcoin markets were not mature enough. Grayscale withdraws its first attempt to convert its trust into an ETF, saying the regulatory environment was not developed enough. 2018: The SEC rejects the Winklevoss twins' second application to launch a spot bitcoin ETF, saying cryptocurrency exchanges do not have the necessary controls to prevent manipulation. 2020: Grayscale transforms its trust into an SEC-reporting entity, and its shares begin trading on the pink sheets, for stocks that trade over the counter. Although not an ETF, it is the first publicly traded bitcoin fund in the U.S. 2021: The first spot bitcoin ETF launches in Canada. Gary Gensler replaces Jay Clayton as SEC chair in April. In October, the SEC approves the ProShares Bitcoin Trust listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, noting the CME has a satisfactory mechanism for surveilling abuse in the futures market. It is the first U.S.-listed futures-based bitcoin ETF, accumulating $1 billion in assets within its first days of trading - faster than any other ETF. Also in October, Grayscale again submits an application to the SEC to convert its trust into a spot bitcoin ETF. 2022: The SEC rejects several applications from would-be spot bitcoin ETF issuers, including SkyBridge, Fidelity and Bitwise. The SEC also rejects Grayscale's application, prompting the company to sue the agency. Amid crashing crypto prices, multiple crypto companies file for bankruptcy, including Three Arrows Capital, Celsius Network and FTX, whose founder Sam Bankman-Fried is also charged with fraud. 2023: May: Cathie Woods' ARK Investments and CBOE Global Markets file for a spot bitcoin ETF, giving the SEC a maximum of 240 days to approve or reject the application. June: BlackRock files a spot bitcoin ETF application with the SEC, raising industry hopes the agency may approve the product and sending the price of bitcoin to a one-year high. A flurry of other issuers and exchanges, including Fidelity and Invesco, file bitcoin ETF applications in the subsequent weeks and months. August: A federal appeals court in Washington D.C. rules in favor of Grayscale, saying the SEC did not justify why it had rejected its proposal. Europe's first spot bitcoin ETF begins trading on the Euronext Amsterdam stock exchange. October: The SEC opts not to appeal the court's ruling in the Grayscale case and is required to reexamine the application. 2024: Jan. 10: The SEC approves 11 proposals from issuers including BlackRock, Fidelity and VanEck, among others, to launch spot bitcoin ETFs. February: Net inflows into the 10 largest ETFs hit $4 billion in the first month, according to LSEG data. March: Bitcoin tops $70,000 for the first time to hit a record high, having doubled in value in the five months. June: Trump pitches himself as a champion for cryptocurrency and slammed Democrats' attempts to regulate the sector during a San Francisco fundraiser. July: Trump tells a bitcoin conference that, if elected, he will create a strategic national bitcoin stockpile and will ensure the United States is the "crypto capital of the planet." October: The SEC grants "accelerated approval" to U.S. exchanges to list and trade options tied to 11 spot bitcoin ETFs. Nov 6: Trump is declared winner of the presidential election, sparking a huge rally in a range of assets, with bitcoin being the standout gainer. Nov 12: Total crypto market cap tops $3 trillion. Year-to-date ETF net inflows hit $25.8 billion, according to LSEG data. Nov 21: Bitcoin nears $100,000 for the first time in history, driven by a swell of buying from investors in anticipation of Trump dismantling a lot of the regulation around crypto investment. The price has risen by around 40 per cent since the election.

Title: On the campaign trail in Dublin Mid-West with Eoin Ó Broin and...Eoin Ó Broin

We need your help now Support from readers like you keeps The Journal open. You are visiting us because we have something you value. Independent, unbiased news that tells the truth. Advertising revenue goes some way to support our mission, but this year it has not been enough. If you've seen value in our reporting, please contribute what you can, so we can continue to produce accurate and meaningful journalism. For everyone who needs it. VOTERS IN DUBLIN Mid-West might think they’re seeing double when they open their ballot paper on 29 November. Two candidates with the same name – and similar taste in snazzy spectacles – are standing in the five-seat constituency. There’s Sinn Féin’s high profile housing spokesman Eoin Ó Broin – and there’s Independent-turned-Social Democrats councillor for Clondalkin Eoin Ó Broin. Sinn Féin’s Ó Broin, on his second canvas of the day at teatime on Tuesday in freezing conditions, is taking no chances: every prospective Sinn Féin voter is warned about the Other Eoin. “Don’t forget, there will be a second Eoin Ó Broin on the ballot,” he explains to one older voter in an estate on the outskirts of Clondalkin village. “Is he with…?” the woman trails off, seemingly confused. “He’s with the Social Democrats. The way it will be on the ballot, my name will be first with my face and the logo. Just follow the face and the logo.” The Eoin Ó Broins of Dublin Mid-West, of Sinn Féin and the Social Democrats respectively. Alamy / TheJournal Alamy / TheJournal / TheJournal The two men know each other. They both live in this area – they’ve even received each other’s post. Sinn Féin’s Ó Broin first became aware of his fellow Eoin 20 years ago when, at a conference in Canada, the person introducing him included details in his potted biography seemingly found online in relation to another Eoin Ó Broin, then president of the University of Limerick students’ union. The two met a couple of years later, when Ó Broin (of Sinn Féin) joined a Shell to Sea protest, alighting a bus in Ballinaboy to see “this fella looking at me”. “And I’m look at him, and I’m going: ‘Are you Eoin Ó Broin?’ And he goes: ‘Are you Eoin Ó Broin’? So we had a big chat.” The Social Democrats’ Eoin is a fluent Irish speaker, having attended Irish-medium schools in Clondalkin; there is a large Irish-speaking community in the area, associated with the longstanding Áras Chrónáin cultural centre. Sinn Féin’s Eoin doesn’t speak Irish, but the Irish language surname is on his birth cert; his father attended a Gaelscoil. A few streets away, earlier that day, the Soc Dems’ Eoin Ó Broin doesn’t let the freezing rain stop him from going door to door. Like his fellow Eoin, he’s out twice a day as the election approaches. His biggest pitch to voters, apart from his own track record as a councillor (he got the council to fix a footpath in this particular estate), is his party’s commitment to Sláintecare – the plan to reform healthcare to end the current two-tier system, a policy with which Social Democrats founder Róisín Shortall has been particularly associated. He believes small parties need to be strategic, and the Social Democrats can position themselves as authoritatively on universal access to healthcare as his namesake has managed to do on housing. He adds that he believes Sláintecare would be “transformative” not only for healthcare but for citizens’ relationship with society and the state in Ireland. “I’ve seen a one-tier health system in Sweden, when I lived there. I didn’t need health insurance, and a trip to the doctor was a tenner,” the Soc Dems’ Ó Broin says. “It gives everybody a sense that they’re getting something back. They don’t have this unfortunate bitterness which exists [among] those who are above thresholds.” He believes the Irish system of means-tested thresholds for medical cards is a “Victorian charity” approach, whereas universal access would be “a game changer we need in Ireland for people to feel that we’re all in this together.” Advertisement The Soc Dems’ Ó Broin completed a PhD in energy systems modelling in Sweden, before undertaking postdoctoral research in France. With his background in environmental science, he was a member of the Green movement when he lived in Sweden, but he believes the Green Party do not sufficiently prioritise housing and workers’ rights. In the estate he’s canvassing today, he meets some voters who say he’ll get their number one, and a few undecideds. Do people bring up the name much? “Yeah. Some people say, ‘this will be fun’. Some people say, ‘that’s confusing, you should change your name’.” He is not impressed by this suggestion. “You know, you don’t just change your name. I grew up in Clondalkin, I went to the all-Irish school here, so because I grew up here and it is my name, why should I change?” the Soc Dems candidate says. (Although Sinn Féin’s Eoin Ó Broin has been living in Clondalkin for many years with his partner, Sinn Féin MEP Lynn Boylan, he is originally from Cabinteely and went to school in Blackrock. A blow-in Ó Broin, if you will.) Election posters in Clondalkin for Eoin Ó Broin and Eoin Ó Broin. The Journal The Journal Housing, waiting times for healthcare and access to supports for those with disabilities and additional needs are among the top issues that come up on the doorsteps in Clondalkin. Access to school places is also a big issue in this area, where public services do not seem to have kept pace with population growth. Both Eoin Ó Broins say the heat has somewhat gone out of the issue of immigration, relative to the local elections in June; this mirrors what The Journal heard from other constituencies. However, immigration is definitely still on the agenda, and it’s raised a few times with Sinn Féin’s Ó Broin. He pushes back hard against the idea that immigrants are being prioritised on the housing list, as one Sinn Féin voter alleges, telling the man that that “every single one of those families” waited on the list for the same length of time as Irish families. “The only people who get council houses are people who have a legal right to reside and work with the state,” he says. However at another house (also voting Sinn Féin) he criticises the government for not consulting with the local community on a nearby accommodation centre for people seeking international protection. He tells a couple who say they’re concerned about the safety of women in the area that “a lot of concerns that you have, which are genuine concerns, can be addressed” through immigration being “properly managed”. “It’s the fear of not knowing what’s going on in your own community, and that’s why, for me, community engagement and consultation is key, right? People are gonna come, right? You can’t stop people coming, but what you have to make sure is when people arrive to claim international protection, there’s a proper process,” Ó Broin tells them. It is understood there have not been any incidents affecting the safety of local residents involving residents of this accommodation centre. Sinn Féin’s immigration manifesto, launched last week, promises to take the provision of accommodation for international protection applicants into complete state control, and pledges that new purpose built centres will not be located in deprived communities. Sinn Féin’s Ó Broin explains that to protect “community cohesion”, good quality accommodation has to provided in communities that “have capacity”, not in those that have been marginalised, and which are struggling already with a lack of basic infrastructure. He says these areas are identifiable using the deprivation index produced by Pobal, the state’s social inclusion agency. By that metric, would areas in this constituency be suitable for new centres – in, say, Lucan, much of which is classified as “affluent” or “very affluent” by Pobal? Ó Broin seems to accept this could indeed by the case, telling The Journal that “the definition of ‘deprived’ is objective, and it has to be”, and adding that “large parts of Dublin city” would be deemed suitable for new centres under Sinn Féin’s plan. However, he adds that Sinn Féin would additionally require audits of local services to check whether there are enough school places and GP places before new accommodation for international protection applicants is approved. Related Reads Soc Dems pledge to spend €5.5 billion on disability legislation reform if in Government 'We want to go into government': SocDems says 50,000 affordable homes is red line issue It sounds like you could rule out almost every area of Dublin with those additional criteria? “No, I don’t believe that,” Ó Broin says, reiteriating that he “absolutely” believes there are areas of Dublin that would right now be suitable for new asylum accommodation. He adds that while he advocates for more community consultation, he does not believe anyone should get a “veto” in the same way that nobody gets to veto Irish people moving into their area. “It’s about respect. It’s about engagement. It’s about talking to people, letting people know what the plan is,” he says. Sinn Féin wants to lead Ireland’s first left-wing government after the election, so if it gets enough seats there’s no doubt Social Democrats leader Holly Cairns will be getting a call from her counterpart, Mary Lou McDonald. For her part, Cairns has indicated she hasn’t ruled out taking that call and talking to Sinn Féin. What do the two Eoin Ó Broins think are the biggest points of difference between their parties? Sinn Féin’s Ó Broin says: “Sinn Fein is the only political party that can lead an alternative government of change. So if people want a change of government, they really need to think wisely as to where they give that vote.” He adds that there are “significant policy differences” between the two parties; the examples he gives are USC (Sinn Féin wants to reduce this tax and the Social Democrats don’t) and the fact that a united Ireland is a “key part of [Sinn Féin's] agenda”. He acknowledges that on healthcare and childcare the two parties’ policies “chime”, but claims Sinn Féin’s housing and other policies are more comprehensive. The other Eoin Ó Broin says the Social Democrats are a “coherent, centre-left party in an international left-wing tradition, whereas Sinn Féin struggle to define where they are politically”. “Migration is a good example,” he says, instancing Sinn Féin’s election literature ahead of the June local elections, which stated that the party was opposed to open borders. “That’s rhetoric borrowed from the United States. The EU has open borders by default. There’s an open border with Northern Ireland that they fought very hard to keep. So it’s that kind of inconsistency, I would say, which differentiates us,” the Social Democrats’ Ó Broin says. He adds that he believes it to be “disingenuous to people” for Sinn Féin “put it out there that we can have a society without property taxes or carbon taxes”. “We’re solid that we want healthcare, education, childcare, elderly care, to be available free at the point of use and paid for by tax, and we’re strong on the environment as well,” he adds. Dublin Mid-West gains an extra seat in this election, so Sinn Féin will be hoping it can once again return two TDs, Ó Broin and Mark Ward. Fine Gael TD Emer Higgins will also try to bring in a running mate, while Fianna Fáil, which lost its seat in 2020, is also running two candidates. People Before Profit TD Gino Kenny is running again. The Social Democrats aren’t the only party to have poached an Independent councillor – Labour has nabbed Clondalkin’s longstanding council poll-topper, Francis Timmons. Independent councillor and former Green Party TD Paul Gogarty, who topped the poll in the June elections in Lucan, could benefit from the fact that the incumbent TDs skew to the Clondalkin end of the constituency, while Independent Ireland councillor Linda de Courcey is running on an immigration platform. There are also candidates from the Greens and Aontú, as well as the anti-EU Irish Freedom Party and anti-immigration Irish People Party, along with other Independents. All candidates running in Dublin Mid-West and nationwide are in The Journal’s candidate database. Check out the database Readers like you are keeping these stories free for everyone...

Title: Bitcoin Barrels Close To $98,000—Is The $100K Barrier Next?

Bitcoin continues its price explosion this Thursday, hitting a new all-time high and breaking the $97,000 barrier during intra-day trading. The crypto asset’s price then spiked 5.7%, reaching $97,811 on Bitstamp, boosting its market cap to $1.93 trillion. The recent surge in Bitcoin’s value is not just a market trend, but a reflection of the growing optimism surrounding incoming US President Donald Trump’s potential crypto-friendly policies and his pick for the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chief. This optimism has led to a 3% increase in the cumulative cryptocurrency market cap, now standing at $3.37 trillion. The 24-hour trading volume on Thursday saw a 5% increase, reaching $ 190 billion. The obvious sign of the optimistic trend in the bitcoin market: its price has more than doubled this year. The whole industry has joined the upward surge, contributing an amazing $900 billion to the total crypto market capitalization. Given that Bitcoin is barely $3,000 short of the $100,000 milestone, the sector is bursting with hope about what the next few weeks can bring for the digital asset. According to Edu Patel, CEO of Mudrex, Bitcoin’s price last year was $30,000. Today, the asset’s price surged to more than $97,000, reflecting a growth of over 300%. Patel said several factors are pushing Bitcoin’s price, including Trump’s election and optimism over his pick as chairman of the SEC, and his friendly crypto policies. In addition, he also acknowledged the growing institutional participation in Bitcoin options and ETFs. The recent price surge of Bitcoin underscores the growing importance of the asset and cryptocurrency to the economy. The Trump administration has also signaled the possibility of creating a specific office to oversee the administration’s cryptocurrency policies. According to some sources, the president’s team is currently considering this office, and many crypto execs are jockeying for an audience with the president. 1/ MicroStrategy just convinced investors to pay $520,234 per Bitcoin That’s the biggest Bitcoin play I’ve ever seen: pic.twitter.com/yeZfGlcm6j — ELI5 of TLDR (@explain_briefly) November 20, 2024 Some experts also attribute Bitcoin’s recent run to MicroStrategy’s bold “Bitcoin-first” policy. Michael Saylor of MicroStrategy has doubled down on this approach and purchased additional BTC to boost its portfolio. Other companies have followed suit and are planning to add the asset to their inventories. The growing popularity of Bitcoin ETFs also helps, and the market currently benefits from the introduction of options trading. According to multiple sources, more than $4 billion has flowed into Bitcoin ETFs since the November elections. Also, this week, Reuters reports that BlackRock is off to an exciting start with its BTC ETFs with call options.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Paul Hickey believes that the AI bull market is likely to continue now. This recent conversation centered around the key forces to watch in the current political and economic landscape, particularly in light of potential energy impacts from Ukraine, shifts in Middle Eastern policies, and possible market effects from trade policies with China. Hickey thinks that as President-elect Donald Trump’s cabinet begins to take shape, it will provide clearer insights into future expectations. He emphasized that while election results can lower barriers to the market and reduce speed bumps, their impact is often overstated. He notes that over the past 16 years, the market has shown strong performance under different administrations, with annualized returns of 16.3% during both Barack Obama’s and Donald Trump’s first terms, and 14% under Joe Biden. This consistency, according to Hickey, suggests that market returns have remained relatively stable despite varying political landscapes. The conversation also highlighted the ongoing AI bull market, which has been broadening since the summer and is expected to continue. The S&P 500 recently closed above 6,000, reflecting positive momentum in the markets, including gains in the NASDAQ. There was a discussion about how a sweeping victory for one party could have been perceived as detrimental to equities; however, Republicans achieved this outcome and equities responded positively. To maintain this momentum, D'Auria suggested that Republicans might need to exercise more fiscal responsibility. The implication is that a single party cannot implement all its plans without consideration of fiscal implications. D'Auria thinks that as tax cuts from 2017 are likely to be extended under Republican leadership, inflation concerns may arise due to higher tariffs and increased government spending. The Republican stance thus far has been viewed as pro-business, which is reflected in current market performance. However, a potential challenge lies ahead; she is of the idea that stocks are now being priced with expectations of a low regulatory environment. This regulatory landscape will be crucial for sustaining market growth moving forward.

Title: Trump’s Crypto Advisory Council to setup promised Strategic Bitcoin Reserve – Report

Major U.S.-based crypto companies are seeking a seat at the council, which will advise on crypto policy and work with Congress on legislation. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. President-elect Donald Trump’s proposed “Crypto Advisory Council” is expected to establish his promised “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve,” Reuters reported on Nov. 21, citing sources familiar with the matter. While presidential advisory councils are not new, a dedicated crypto council would be unprecedented, reflecting the sector’s rapid evolution since Bitcoin’s inception in 2008. Blockchain Association CEO Kristin Smith emphasized the urgency of the council’s formation, stating it is “something Trump could do very quickly.” According to the report, the council will also advise on crypto policy and work with Congress on crypto legislation. It added that the council may be housed under the White House’s National Economic Council or operate independently. According to industry insiders, major US-based companies, including Coinbase, Paradigm, and Andreessen Horowitz’s crypto arm, a16z, Ripple, Kraken, and Circle, are seeking a seat on the council. Bitcoin Magazine CEO David Bailey, a key organizer behind Trump’s July appearance at a Nashville Bitcoin Conference, said: “It’s being fleshed out, but I anticipate the leading executives from America’s Bitcoin and crypto firms to be represented.” Excitement over Trump’s pro-crypto stance has already buoyed Bitcoin (BTC) prices, which touched a new all-time high of $99,100 on Nov. 21. Satoshi Act Fund founder Dennis Porter is discussing introducing legislation in Texas on a “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.” The Texas movement is Porter’s latest effort to introduce a dedicated Bitcoin reserve to a US state. On Nov. 14, Pennsylvania, through Representative Mike Cabell, introduced a bill to create a BTC reserve using the state’s $7 billion fund. The proposal suggests an initial allocation of up to 10% in Bitcoin but also acknowledges that a smaller exposure of 1% to 5% could be a more suitable starting point. After Pennsylvania’s proposal, Porter stated that up to 10 more US states will likely follow suit this year, with Texas potentially being the first. Additionally, he previously told CryptoSlate that state governments are rushing to pass legislation establishing their own BTC Reserves, as President-elect Donald Trump’s administration is considering an executive order to formalize this matter. The idea of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve gained traction following Trump’s election. During his presidential campaign, he displayed a pro-crypto stance, and one of his promises was to create a BTC reserve in the U.S. Treasury. This idea was quickly backed by pro-crypto politicians, such as Senator Cynthia Lummis, who introduced legislation for such reserve called “The Bitcoin Act” and believes Trump could approve it in his first 100 days at the White House. The council will likely coordinate with regulatory agencies, including the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), and Treasury, to craft crypto policy and streamline enforcement efforts. Trump’s team is also reportedly considering creating a “crypto czar” role to lead the council, with candidates such as former CFTC Chair Heath Tarbert, ex-Commissioner Brian Quintenz, and former SEC chief Christopher Giancarlo under consideration. The move comes as Trump promises to reverse President Joe Biden’s stringent enforcement actions. The administration is expected to prioritize executive orders that ensure crypto companies’ access to banking services, halt enforcement actions, and position the industry as a strategic economic asset. Critics, including consumer advocacy groups, caution against allowing the crypto industry to heavily influence policymaking, warning of potential conflicts of interest. Some ethics considerations may delay appointments, though industry leaders argue that experienced voices are essential for crafting effective regulations. Anchorage Digital CEO Nathan McCauley stated: “It’s absolutely the wise choice to put together a council of people who… understand how both the industry ought to be regulated and how to situate the industry to be a strategic asset.” Gino Matos is a law school graduate and a seasoned journalist with six years of experience in the crypto industry.

Title: Citadel founder Ken Griffin said he would be 'open' to selling a stake in his $65 billion hedge fund

BlackRock's potential investment into Izzy Englander's Millennium might have Citadel founder Ken Griffin thinking. At the Economic Club of New York Thursday, Griffin complimented BlackRock founder Larry Fink for being a "legend in asset management" and said that if the tie-up eventually does go through, "it's a very interesting" one. The early-stage talks between BlackRock and multistrategy rival Millennium were reported by the Financial Times earlier this month. Asked if he would consider such a move, the billionaire said he'd "be open to selling a minority stake," which Citadel, the $65 billion hedge fund that's become the most profitable firm in the industry's history, has never done. "We take great pride in being a private partnership," he said, and believes the structure has helped the firm run smoothly for the more than 30 years it's been in existence. Nearly every hedge fund is still owned by its founders and a select group of partners, even the older industry giants like Citadel, though Griffin may be looking to sell a stake at the peak. He said in a Bloomberg interview on Tuesday that the extreme growth that has added billions of assets to his fund and his peers' is not likely to continue. In New York Thursday, he pointed out the benefits of selling a stake in his market maker Citadel Securities in 2022 to venture capital firms Sequoia and Paradigm for more than $1 billion. The investment valued the firm at $22 billion. He said Sequoia in particular brought "real insights" into how to manage a rapidly growing company, noting the firm's past investments into Apple and Nvidia before the two companies were public. Griffin said Sequoia has pushed Citadel Securities' leadership in the boardroom, making them a better company. As for who he'd want as a minority stakeholder of Citadel, Griffin clearly has a type. "We'd look for a partner that feels like Sequoia," he said. Jump to

Title: Can Bitcoin Solve The Sovereign Debt Crisis?

Time Published: 2024-11-21T18:12:07Z

Photo by Chesnot/Getty Images The United States is facing a fiscal crisis of historic proportions. Ballooning deficits, runaway debt service costs, and the risk of a bond market meltdown are pushing the nation toward uncharted territory. Traditional solutions, whether austerity, tax hikes, or controlled inflation, are inadequate. Could a radically different approach, leveraging bitcoin, chart a path forward? A thoughtful post by @stackhodler on X entertained the idea that bitcoin could play a role in addressing a sovereign debt crisis. This thought experiment requires an understanding of how money systems evolve during times of upheaval, plus a little imagination. From the collapse of the Roman denarius to the end of the Bretton Woods gold standard, monetary resets are not new. How might bitcoin kick off the next chapter in global money? The problem starts with unsustainable debt. In the wake of trillions in COVID-era spending, the U.S. has grown dependent on short-term Treasury bills, leaving its finances vulnerable to rising interest rates. Government spending is totally out of control, and the number of people who are partially or wholly dependent on government transfer payments has mushroomed. For all the consternation among conservatives about Democratic policies moving the U.S. in the direction of socialism, there is surprisingly little attention paid to the reality that it is already here. As outlined in our earlier analysis, there is a danger that rising interest rates could lead to a debt spiral in Trump’s second term. Higher borrowing costs would beget more borrowing, which would fuel yet higher costs. This would apply inflationary pressure to the dollar that would be difficult to counteract, even with the radical spending cuts promised by the DOGE initiative spearheaded by Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy. This feedback loop is hard to escape in the fiat system. Tax hikes slow growth, spending cuts invite backlash, and inflation – though politically expedient in the short term – would destroy the purchasing power of the voting public. The result is a dollar teetering on collapse, where global competitors like China use its weakness to siphon soft power away from the United States. The question is: how could bitcoin fit into a solution for sovereign debt? Don your tinfoil hat and get ready to entertain a fascinating, if speculative, scenario. As U.S. policymakers recognize the inevitability of a monetary reset, the first move would be strategic devaluation of the dollar. By flooding global markets with dollars, the U.S. would trigger inflation across rival economies, destabilizing their currencies while counterintuitively protecting the dollar’s status as the premiere global reserve currency. Sound familiar? The inflationary result of the COVID and post-COVID debt bonanza was predictable, leaving one to speculate about why the powers-that-be allowed it to transpire. The explanation need not require a grand conspiracy. The Cantillion Effect is reason enough. On an individual level, powerful politicians and financiers store their wealth in assets, not cash. Printing money does not put them at risk, since more dollars chasing the same number of scarce assets simply raises the prices of the assets they already own. And because they can use their privileged position to acquire assets with the newly printed money faster than the broader market can, they are even able to increase their wealth by snapping up more before inflation causes prices to rise. Combine that with the power to route newly printed dollars to institutions (and stakeholders within them), and you have strong incentive alignment among elites to spend as much money as quickly as they can. If they agreed in aggregate that the dollar’s demise is inevitable, you would expect to see them racing to print dollars and scoop up assets, while using their political power to bestow money (and the assets it can buy) upon those in their trust networks to strengthen their positions in the social hierarchy. This logic is sound, if perverse, and it would explain why the U.S. government spent trillions of dollars unnecessarily under the guise of COVID spending after the crisis was long over. If you’re in a car careening at high speed towards a chasm, and your brakes don’t work, you press down on the accelerator and hope that by increasing your speed you might make the jump to the other side. The other side is bitcoin – not because bitcoin is perfect or desirable, but simply because there is no alternative. For over a decade, the U.S. government has battled bitcoin – from the unjust withholding of approval to sell financial products that touch it, to the frontal attack on bitcoin-friendly banks by the Biden-Harris administration. However, in 2024, the tune suddenly changed. The ultimate Big Finance insider, BlackRock, began selling and promoting bitcoin. Pension funds, family offices, and individual investors now have easy access to bitcoin exposure, with no need of technical knowledge. Now that capital markets are open to large-scale adoption of bitcoin, the U.S. is free to pivot to endorse it as a reserve asset. Whether or not it is yet happening, it’s now indisputably possible for the masses to use bitcoin as a hedge against the declining dollar. If the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve comes to fruition and the U.S. Department of the Treasury begins purchasing and holding bitcoin, other nations would need to compete by doing the same. Some would sell assets – including U.S. Treasury bonds. Others would print their currencies to purchase it. The result would be further acceleration of capital exiting the fiat system and entering the bitcoin ledger. Suppose the U.S. Treasury acquires significant bitcoin reserves while simultaneously allowing the dollar to slide into oblivion. As bitcoin appreciates – potentially into multi-million-dollar territory – it could offset the national debt in nominal terms. A hyperinflating dollar paired with appreciating bitcoin reserves would invert the current debt dynamic, allowing liabilities to shrink relative to assets. Perhaps this is what President Trump was gesturing at when he suggested that the U.S. could pay off its $35 trillion debt with bitcoin. Much derided at the time, could this have been another example of Trump’s intuition being correct, if not clearly expressed? Transitioning from the dollar to bitcoin wouldn’t come without pain. Dollar hyperinflation would create chaos and dislocation across the entire planet. But bitcoin would provide the foundation on which to rebuild. And, those holding bitcoin – governments, financial institutions, and individuals – would have their wealth preserved through the upheaval. Now that Americans have clearly marked exits from fiat to bitcoin, the U.S. economy could emerge in the 21st century strongly positioned to continue its dominance, while late adopters scramble to adjust. If bitcoin were to become a global reserve asset, it would kick off a new era of fiscal discipline. Unlike fiat, bitcoin’s fixed supply imposes natural constraints on government spending, forcing policymakers to operate within the bounds of solvency. Reckless deficit spending, forever wars, and currency debasement would become relics of the fiat past. A bitcoin-based financial system wouldn’t just rein in excess, it would also encourage investment in ultra-long-term, ambitious projects. Bitcoin would be used to underwrite energy resource development, infrastructure revitalization, and most importantly, interplanetary expansion. Freed from the distortions of fiat monetary policy, markets could allocate capital efficiently, fostering an explosion of productive growth. This scenario is not as far-fetched as it may first seem. By historical standards, the dollar is past its sell-by date, and the postwar “rules-based international order” is clearly under renegotiation. World reserve currency periods.

AI stocks are soaring and AI startups are receiving billions in funding from venture capital firms as the new technology sweeps investors off their feet. However, as the AI boom plays out, the central bank in Europe has issued a dire warning about the development of an AI bubble. The warning was included in the biannual Financial Stability Review, a report that lists the risks that could threaten the financial well being of world markets. In the review, the European Central Bank noted that the stock market, particularly in the United States, had become increasingly dependent on a handful of companies perceived as the beneficiaries of the AI boom.

Title: Bitcoin Price Almost Hits $98,000: Key Reasons Behind The Rally

Bitcoin has reached a new all-time high, surging to $97,852 on Binance. The cryptocurrency is up 5% in the last 24 hours and has gained an impressive 43% over the past 16 days since November 5. The momentum shows no signs of slowing as BTC price continues its steady ascent. Several key factors are driving this remarkable rally: Following Donald Trump’s victory in the US presidential election, market sentiment has shifted significantly. The initial “Trump trade” has evolved into the “US Bitcoin Reserve Trade,” fueled by speculation that President-elect Trump may establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR). This follows his pledge at the Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville. Industry insiders like David Bailey, CEO of BTC Inc and a Trump campaign advisor, and Dennis Porter, CEO of Satoshi Act Fund, have hinted at the possibility of the SBR becoming a reality. Both have urged that the SBR be established within the first 100 days of Trump’s presidency through an executive order. They warn of the United States potentially falling behind in the global race to accumulate BTC. Bailey revealed on November 9, “There is at least one nation-state that has been actively acquiring Bitcoin and is now a top 5 holder. Hopefully, we hear from them soon.” He emphasized his certainty with a meme, indicating his information is based on knowledge rather than speculation. Mike Novogratz, CEO of Galaxy Digital, confirmed in a recent interview with Bloomberg TV that “countries are already buying BTC in huge volumes.” The “US Bitcoin Reserve Trade” is expected to continue until Trump’s inauguration on January 20. It remains to be seen whether Trump will follow through on his promises, potentially moving over 208,000 BTC confiscated by law enforcement into the reserve or even adopting Senator Cynthia Lummis’ Bitcoin Act proposal to purchase 1 million BTC over five years. A leak on Wednesday suggests that President-elect Trump’s team is in discussions about creating a new White House position dedicated solely to Bitcoin and crypto policy. Sources familiar with the transition efforts indicate that candidates are being vetted for this role. If established, it would be the first-ever Bitcoin and crypto-specific White House position, underscoring the influence the nascent industry stands to wield in the incoming administration. It is unclear whether the role will be a senior White House staff position or a “crypto czar” overseeing policy and regulation across the federal government. Crypto industry advocates are pushing for the role to have a direct line to Trump – a massive news for the entire industry. The introduction of Bitcoin ETF options has had a significant impact on the market. BlackRock’s iShares BTC Trust (IBIT) ETF options, launched on November 19, 2024, saw an unprecedented $1.9 billion in notional exposure on their first day of trading. Bloomberg ETF expert James Seyffart stated, “Final tally of IBIT’s 1st day of options is just shy of $1.9 billion in notional exposure traded via 354k contracts. 289k were Calls & 65k were Puts. That’s a ratio of 4.4:1. These options were almost certainly part of the move to the new Bitcoin all-time highs today.” Jeff Park, Head of Alpha Strategies at Bitwise Invest, recently highlighted the game-changing nature of Bitcoin ETF options: With the approval by the SEC to list and trade Bitcoin ETF options, we are on the verge of witnessing the most extraordinary upside ‘vol’ of ‘vol’ in financial history. For the first time, Bitcoin’s notional value will be ‘fractionally banked’ with ETF options. This marks the most monumental advancement possible for the crypto market. Park explained that Bitcoin ETF options provide a regulated market where the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC) protects clearing members from counterparty risks, allowing Bitcoin’s synthetic notional exposure to grow exponentially. He emphasized that this could lead to an explosive recursive effect on Bitcoin’s price due to unique volatility characteristics and the “volatility smile.” If there were one thing to read today re the game-changing nature of Bitcoin ETF options, read (and bookmark) this one for 2025 – it’s going to be wild. pic.twitter.com/On2DmUsbHX — Jeff Park (@dgt10011) September 20, 2024 The latest rally has also been driven by significant activity in the spot market. Heavy spot bids have propelled the price higher, with yesterday’s BTC ETF inflows being a crucial factor. Inflows amounted to $773.4 million, with BlackRock contributing $626.5 million, Fidelity $133.9 million, Bitwise $9.2 million, and ARK Invest $3.8 million. Over the past three days, US spot Bitcoin ETFs have purchased a staggering $1.856 billion worth of Bitcoin. Good morning, Yesterday’s Bitcoin ETF flows were positive for $773.4 million. Blackrock did $626.5 million, Fidelity $133.9 million. (BTC the mini-ETF is still missing data) Price slowly climbing higher from $92K up to $97k now.

There aren’t attractive investment deals in the clean energy sector right now, especially in emerging and developing markets, the executive told Bloomberg, declining to go into details how much the fund has spent over the past year. The UAE, a major oil producer in the Middle East, launched Alterra at the COP28 summit in Dubai last year. The fund’s goals are to “drive forward international efforts to create a fairer climate finance system, with an emphasis on improving access to funding for the Global South.” With $30 billion committed, Alterra became the world’s largest private investment vehicle for climate change action. The fund has stated its goal to mobilize as much as $250 billion globally by 2030 and help bridge the gap in investment into the solutions needed to keep the world on the 1.5 degrees Celsius pathway, drive investment into the Global South, and create new investment opportunities and strategies for emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs). In collaboration with BlackRock, Brookfield, and TPG as inaugural launch partners, Alterra has so far committed $6.5 billion to climate-dedicated funds for global investments. However, the actual money spent on funds is significantly lower than this initial commitment, Alterra’s CEO Majid Al Suwaidi told Bloomberg in Azerbaijan, which is currently hosting the COP29 climate summit. The project financing of energy transition projects is often complicated because of the mix of public and private investments needed. According to Alterra’s Al Suwaidi, it is difficult to mobilize financing from the public sector, which is often experiencing financial troubles, while private investors and banks are averse to taking a lot of risk.

Bitcoin is on a roll — again. Bitcoin’s stratospheric rise continues, with the world’s largest cryptocurrency spiking to new heights on Thursday as an upsurge catalyzed by former president Donald Trump’s win earlier this month continued. The $100,000-per-BTC psychologically important mark is now just a stone’s throw away. Bitcoin rose to as high as $98,310.57 earlier today, CoinGecko data shows. At this level, BTC is roughly 2% from the much-anticipated $100,000 milestone that would drive it above a $2 trillion market cap. Bitcoin has gained roughly 46% over the past month, propelled by bullish sentiment across digital assets and broader equities following President-elect Donald Trump’s successful return bid for the Oval Office on Nov. 6. Industry participants have dubbed the parabolic rally the “Trump Trade,” as all assets, including equities, bonds, and digital currencies, have surged since Trump defeated Kamala Harris. Traders view Trump’s win as a favorable environment, providing a clear runway for deregulation and business-friendly policies to spur continued rallies into next year. For crypto, Trump’s administration is expected to drive regulation designed to establish a domestic Bitcoin reserve, safeguard crypto mining interests, end the current administration’s hostile regulatory stance, and foster innovation. In fact, the President-elect’s team is reportedly planning to create a position focused on crypto policy, which would be a first for the White House, according to Bloomberg. The team is assessing potential candidates to serve in that role. The unprecedented demand for the newly launched BlackRock IBIT options, which track BTC prices and are poised to dramatically increase liquidity in the market, has also added to the latest bullish momentum. On Nov. 19, the first day of trading on the Nasdaq, the new options contracts recorded nearly $2 billion in notional exposure traded on its first day, as ZyCrypto reported. Bitcoin is now on track to surpass $100,000 in the coming one or two months, as observed by MN Capital founder Michaël van de Poppe. Up 3.2% on the day, Bitcoin is less than $3,000 from the historic six-figure achievement. Meanwhile, Bitcoin trader Bitcoin Munger shared a Glassnode chart on X showing massive accumulation across all cohorts, noting that BTC is likely to “blow way past” $100,000.

Title: McCanns win votes to take Balmoral private amid cries of ‘corporate greed’
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2024/11/21/mccanns-win-votes-to-take-balmoral-private-amid-cries-of-corporate-greed/
Time Published: 2024-11-21T15:36:20Z
Full Content:
A move by the McCann family, once synonymous with Fyffes, to take Balmoral International Land fully private secured backing at an extraordinary general meeting (egm) on Thursday, even as some small shareholders vented ire as they face being squeezed out under the deal. Almost 98 per cent of voting shareholders, led by McCann-controlled vehicles that already own just over 61 per cent of the stock, cast in favour of a mandatory buyback of stock held by investors holding fewer than 25,000 shares. These account for a combined 22.4 per cent stake in the company and many of them did not vote. The transaction will increase the direct McCann family stakes and indirect holdings, through vehicles they control, to a combined 79 per cent. It is being priced at €10.50 a share, 44 per cent below Balmoral’s most recent reported net asset value per share of €18.72. While it marks a 110 per cent premium to where the shares traded on the grey market last November – before stockbrokers stopped openly facilitating trades due to the burden of paperwork – it is below the €12 level at which a block of over 16,000 shares changed hands last week. That was the first reported trade in 12 months. It is not clear who handled that trade. Colm Whooley, a small shareholder, described the transaction as “corporate greed” at the sometimes tense egm in Dublin. “Balmoral is now a healthy company. There is no justification for the [44] per cent discount to take us out,” he said. “It’s not a company in distress or any difficulty.” Another of four investors to speak – out of about 15 small shareholders that turned up to the meeting – questioned why the company, whose €5 million of administration costs last year equated to 52 per cent of gross rental income, did not opt to sell off its assets instead. He noted that much of Balmoral’s investment assets comprise industrial and warehouse buildings which have outperformed the wider commercial property market in recent years. Balmoral chairman Carl McCann said the €10.50 price was higher than a share redemption price suggested by Davy, the board’s financial adviser, and reflects how most listed property stocks are currently trading at deep discounts to NAV (net asset value). He said the notion of a break-up of the company “wouldn’t be appealing” to directors and other large investors who took a risk committing fresh capital to refinance the business following the financial crisis. “It’s a miracle for the company to be here today,” he said. He suggested take-private deals over the past five years of property companies Green Reit, Hibernian Reit and Yew Grove Reit, each at a slight premium to NAV, would each likely be priced at a deep discount if they took place today. However, some of the vocal investors countered that NAVs across the sector have already declined in recent years, amid a spike in interest rates and other factors. The company was originally named Blackrock International Land when it was spun out by Fyffes in 2006 as a separate publicly-quoted entity. It was delisted in 2011 following a slump in its share price during the property crash, but continues to have thousands of legacy shareholders that have remained on board since the stock market exit. The McCann family sold their decades-held shares in Fyffes in 2017 to Japanese conglomerate Sumitomo. The Tokyo-based firm subsequently sold the 30 per cent interest in Balmoral it inherited to a vehicle led by the McCanns. Mr McCann is also executive chairman of Dole Plc, the Irish-based but New York-listed fresh produce company created in 2021 through the merger of Dole Foods with former Total Produce. Dole and Fyffes are among Balmoral’s main tenants. The fair value of Balmoral’s investment assets, comprised of industrial and warehouse buildings, offices and mixed-use land, edged up to €146.3 million in June from €138 million in December, the company disclosed in a circular in October.

Title: Ireland v Fiji team news: Gus McCarthy, Cormac Izuchukwu and Sam Prendergast all start

Time Published: 2024-11-21T13:58:18Z
Full Content:
As forecast, Andy Farrell has given Test debuts to the 21-year-old Leinster hooker Gus McCarthy and the 24-year-old Ulster flanker Cormac Izuchukwu in making seven changes to the Ireland starting line-up for Saturday’s Autumn Nations Series game against Fiji at the Aviva Stadium (kick-off 3.10pm). One of those additional changes will see Sam Prendergast make his full Test debut after playing the last 18 minutes of Ireland’s 22-19 win over Argentina last Friday. Jamie Osborne, who made his international debut when seamlessly replacing Hugo Keenan for both Tests last summer in South Africa, returns at fullback after winning his third and fourth caps with eye-catching displays off the bench in midfield against the All Blacks and Los Pumas. Jacob Stockdale has been rewarded for his try-scoring form in an Ulster jersey with a recall on the left wing to earn his 38th cap and his first since Ireland’s final World Cup warm-up game against Samoa in Bayonne, while Bundee Aki also returns to midfield, with Robbie Henshaw shifting to outside centre. Craig Casey, who started the first Test in South Africa before being ruled out of the second due to a head injury, starts at scrumhalf, while McCarthy and Izuchukwu are the two changes in personnel up front, with Tadhg Beirne reverting to the secondrow in a positional switch. Save for the retention of Thomas Clarkson, one of two debutants last week, it is a completely rejigged bench, with Tom O’Toole, Iain Henderson, Conor Murray, Ciarán Frawley and Stuart McCloskey all returning. So too does the Connacht captain Cian Prendergast, who is in line to win his fourth cap and first since the World Cup warm-up win over England, thus ensuring a memorable day for himself, his younger brother and his family. Mindful that Ireland have undertaken a fourth November game against Australia on Saturday week, Farrell has rested Keenan, Garry Ringrose, James Lowe, Jack Crowley, Jamison Gibson-Park and James Ryan, while Cian Healy will have to wait another week to eclipse Brian O’Driscoll as Ireland’s most capped player of all time. The 21-year-old McCarthy, a product of Blackrock College, was captain of the Ireland Under-20 side which won the Grand Slam and reached the final of the Under-20 World Cup in Cape Town two seasons ago, with Prendergast the team’s star turn. McCarthy has been exposed to plenty of rugby this season, due to injuries for Dan Sheehan and Rónan Kelleher, and has backed up his dynamic and mobile performances on the Emerging Ireland tour in September by impressing the Irish coaches at training in this November window. Born in London to an Irish mother and Nigerian father, Izuchukwu started playing in Tullamore RFC and has made a rapid rise since the latter stages of last season. After completing his Leaving Cert cycle in Roscrea College, Izuchukwu had notions of travelling the world playing rugby. But a video compilation of his highlight reels while playing with Kelso in Scotland was sent to Anthony Eddy and he brought Izuchukwu into the Ireland Sevens fold, which in turn led to a place in the Ulster academy. Given a run of games by Richie Murphy toward the end of last season, Izuchukwu caught the eye with his ball-carrying and athleticism, and also impressed the Irish coaches on his second Emerging Ireland tour. “Izzy has been in and around the squad now for a while actually. The first Emerging Ireland is when we first came across his ability, his athleticism,” said Farrell. “The difference between the first [Emerging Ireland] tour and the second tour was chalk and cheese. His ability, point of difference, his potential with that maturity, he deserves a shot to show what he’s got. “Gus, what a rise in such a short space of time,” added Farrell of McCarthy, and citing the maturity that came with captaining the Irish Under-20s, albeit he was first named in this November squad as a training panellist. “But rugby is a strange thing. You think there’s a pecking order and all of a sudden, a couple of players get an injury then a kid gets an opportunity, and he shows up really well when we take him on the training week with us as a development player. He showed up unbelievably well and he’s forced our arm to keep him in the squad, first and foremost. And he deserves a shot to see what he can do as well.” As ever, Farrell was also bullish about Sam Prendergast’s potential. “I’m confident from what we’ve seen. We took him on the Emerging tour and he played in all of those games and the aim of that was for him to grab hold of that team and make sure that he treated it like his own as though he was in charge. He did that in spades and this week we’ve seen the benefit of that. We need to see it transfer obviously. “His character is composed, he is confident but yet not over-confident. He’s assertive in what he wants, and he has a nice way in how he goes about his business.” Farrell said he would encourage Frawley to be himself, adding: “He’s super excited that he gets another chance to right the wrongs of a couple of weeks ago and we’re excited about seeing him play because he’s a top-quality player.” As for Stockdale, the Irish coach said: “He’s chomping at the bit and this is his chance to show us what he’s about at this level again.” It’s been a frustrating month so far for Tadhh Furlong, who still hasn’t recovered from his hamstring strain. “He’s tried his best,” said Farrell. “I feel for him. It’s been tough because everyone is desperate to play for Ireland and he’s worked really hard to try and get back there and we were hoping it was going to be this week. You’re always trying to push on to the next stage and get through that and he didn’t quite manage that.” IRELAND (v Fiji): Jamie Osborne (Leinster); Mack Hansen (Connacht), Robbie Henshaw (Leinster), Bundee Aki (Connacht), Jacob Stockdale (Ulster); Sam Prendergast (Leinster), Craig Casey (Munster); Andrew Porter (Leinster), Gus McCarthy (Leinster), Finlay Bealham (Connacht); Joe McCarthy (Leinster), Tadhg Beirne (Munster); Cormac Izuchukwu (Ulster), Josh van der Flier (Leinster), Caelan Doris (Leinster, capt).

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 8 Best Fertilizer Stocks To Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Bioceres Crop Solutions Corp. (NASDAQ:BIOX) stands against the other fertilizer stocks. The fertilizer industry is a crucial sector in agriculture that focuses on the production and distribution of substances that enhance plant growth. By supplying necessary nutrients, fertilizers help improve crop yields and quality, which are essential for feeding the growing global population. The industry has evolved significantly over time, with modern practices relying heavily on chemically manufactured fertilizers to support large-scale farming and meet the global demand for food. According to Mordor Intelligence, the global fertilizer market is estimated to have reached a value of $381.7 billion in 2024. Looking forward, the market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.99% during 2024-2030 to reach $541.2 billion by ​the end of the forecast period. READ ALSO: 10 Undervalued Chemical Stocks to Invest In and 7 Best Agriculture Stocks to Buy Right Now. There is a strong sense of optimism within the industry. The Fertilizer Institute’s 2023 Industry Trends Survey highlighted a positive outlook within the fertilizer sector, with many respondents expressing confidence in future growth. About 40% of those surveyed believe that market conditions have improved over the past five years, despite challenges like the COVID-19 pandemic and supply chain disruptions. Companies attribute their resilience to strategic practices such as precommitment purchases and careful planning. Nearly 80% of participants are optimistic about their businesses being equally or more profitable in the next five years. The fertilizer industry is currently experiencing several key trends that are shaping its future. Advances in technology are transforming how fertilizers are produced and applied. Innovations such as precision agriculture, which uses data analytics and sensors, help farmers optimize fertilizer usage based on specific soil conditions and crop needs. Additionally, there is a growing demand for fertilizers that offer more nutrients while reducing their environmental impact. The emphasis on maximizing the efficiency of fertilizer application to promote sustainable farming practices is increasing, which is driving the development of new and innovative solutions. On August 13, CNBC reported that Windfall Bio, a California-based startup, is addressing methane emissions using "mems," or methane-eating microbes. These microbes naturally consume methane and convert it into fertilizer. This innovative approach helps reduce harmful methane from sources like agriculture, landfills, and oil production. Farmers can use the fertilizer produced, while companies generating waste methane can sell it back to Windfall, creating a new revenue stream. These trends indicate a dynamic shift in the fertilizer industry, balancing the need for increased food production with environmental sustainability and innovation.

November 21, 2024 08:00 ET | Source: Ubitium Ubitium Düsseldorf, Nov. 21, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- For over half a century, general-purpose processors have been built on the Tomasulo algorithm, developed by IBM engineer Robert Tomasulo in 1967. It’s a $500B industry built on specialised CPU, GPU and other chips for different computing tasks. Hardware startup Ubitium has shattered this paradigm with a breakthrough universal processor that handles all computing workloads on a single, efficient chip - unlocking simpler, smarter, and more cost-effective devices across industries - while revolutionizing a 57-year-old industry standard. Alongside this, Ubitium is announcing a $3.7 million in seed funding round, co-led by Runa Capital, Inflection, and KBC Focus Fund. The investment will be used to develop the first prototypes and prepare initial development kits for customers, with the first chips planned for 2026. Ubitium founders Martin Vorbach and Hyun Shin Sho Ubitium was founded by semiconductor veterans dedicated to revolutionizing processor architecture. CTO Martin Vorbach, who holds over 200 semiconductor patents licensed by major U.S. chip companies, spent 15 years developing this groundbreaking technology. Drawing from his pioneering work in reconfigurable computing, he created a workload-agnostic microarchitecture that allows the same transistors to be reused for different processing tasks—eliminating the need for multiple specialized cores and enabling AI at no additional cost. Working between Germany and Cupertino, California, Vorbach's innovation forms the foundation of Ubitium's mission. Vorbach met CEO Hyun Shin Cho at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT). After two decades of gaining insights across various industrial sectors, Cho reunited with Vorbach to commercialize the technology. Completing the team is Chairman Peter Weber, a veteran of Intel, Texas Instruments, and Dialog Semiconductor, who brings extensive industry expertise. "The $500 billion processor industry is built on restrictive boundaries between computing tasks," says Hyun Shin Cho, CEO of Ubitium. "We're erasing those boundaries. Our Universal Processor does it all - CPU, GPU, DSP, FPGA - in one chip, one architecture. This isn't an incremental improvement. It is a paradigm shift. This is the processor architecture the AI era demands." “For too long, we’ve accepted that making devices intelligent means making them complex. Multiple processors or processor cores, multiple development teams, endless integration challenges—today, that changes. Our Universal Processor delivers workload-agnostic and AI-enabling compute capabilities to edge devices with a single chip, at a fraction of the cost to develop and manufacture compared to today’s offerings.” With the semiconductor market projected to exceed $700 billion by 2025, Ubitium's technology initially targets embedded systems and robotics. By simplifying system architectures and reducing costs, Ubitium's processor makes advanced computing capabilities accessible across all industries without requiring specialized hardware for each application—enabling advanced AI at no additional cost. Dmitry Galperin, a Berlin-based General Partner at Runa Capital, commented: "We're impressed by Ubitium's unique approach to processor microarchitecture, which is now able to adapt to any type of workload—from simple control logic to massive parallel data flow processing." "What Ubitium brings will provide a real breakthrough to develop and launch any new product with embedded electronics. Their approach will reduce the cost as well as the complexity, allowing a much faster time-to-market. What previously required multiple teams to collaborate on hardware and software design now becomes purely a software project," said Rudi Severijns, Investment Director at KBC Focus Fund. "Ubitium was a perfect fit as a contrarian bet on a stellar team working on generalized compute capacity in a world of chip specialization," said Jonatan Luther-Bergquist, Partner at Inflection. “We are excited to see Ubitium leveraging the flexibility and scalability of the RISC-V architecture,” said Calista Redmond, CEO of RISC-V International. “Their innovative approach to universal processor design exemplifies the freedom of innovation made possible by the RISC-V Instruction Set Architecture and highlights the potential for RISC-V to drive advancements in edge computing and AI applications.” Looking ahead, Ubitium plans to develop a complete portfolio of chips that vary in array size but share the same microarchitecture and software stack—enabling solutions from small embedded devices to high-performance computing systems. This super-scalable approach allows customers to scale their applications without changing their development process, while the workload-agnostic design ensures the processor can adapt to handle any computing task without specialized hardware modifications. The company's goal is to establish its universal processor as the new standard that finally breaks down the cost and complexity barriers that have limited the deployment of advanced computing and AI capabilities across industries. "We envision a future where every device operates autonomously, making intelligent decisions in real time and transforming the way we interact with technology," added Hyun Shin Cho.

Title: Exclusive: Arcade, visual storytelling platform, raises $14 million Series A led by Kleiner Perkins

Caroline Clark’s first word was “up.” Every child’s first word is seismic, and it was especially so for Clark: At the age of two, she was diagnosed as deaf. In a taped 2019 talk from her time in business school at Stanford, Clark tells the story of how her mother taught her to speak, starting word by word. And because no one’s more equipped to improve communication than someone who has truly spent time thinking about it deeply, Clark is now the cofounder and CEO of Arcade, a visual storytelling platform. “That experience learning how to speak from my mother has taught me how precious it is to choose every word,” she said. “I’ve used words to tell myself what’s possible. They’re powerful. In many ways, I think Arcade is helping you achieve that power—not only coming up with the right words but showing them in the most creative way possible.” It’s fitting that, in some sense, Clark’s job is helping companies find their voices, visuals, and stories. Arcade’s customers currently include Salesforce, Zapier, Atlassian, New Relic, Superhuman, and Carta, all of whom use the platform to develop interactive demos. “I think that people underestimate Arcade,” Clark told Fortune. “They say ‘Oh, it’s just a demo tool,’ but I think the word ‘demo’ is limiting. It’s really about content, collaboration, and creativity.” The company probably won’t be underestimated much longer, with more than 14,000 companies using the platform—and a new milestone. Arcade has raised a $14 million Series A, led by Kleiner Perkins, Fortune can exclusively report. Upfront Ventures and Foundation Capital, both existing investors, also participated in the round. Founded in 2021, Arcade draws inspiration from video games in both its name and product, which includes features like pulsating dots and load times. That’s not an accident—Clark and I talked about comic books (she recently read video game designer Jordan Mechner’s graphic memoir Replay) and her belief in “playfulness and going through the product as adventure.” Aditi Maliwal, Upfront Ventures partner, wrote the first check into Arcade in March 2021, and she’s watched Clark grow the company from a product into an enterprise sales company. “It’s really hard to cross that chasm and it takes a long time, but she’s a force of nature,” said Maliwal, who’s known Clark for seven years. “I wear this bracelet every day that says ‘resilience’ and, to me, Caroline signifies resilience. She truly had to learn how to hear and how to speak. She’s learned how to hear through her eyes.” Arcade’s opportunity fundamentally ties back to “the sea of software everywhere we go,” said Kleiner Perkins partner Mamoon Hamid. Clark had for years specifically wanted to work with Hamid, drawn to his track record investing in gorgeous workplace efficiency juggernauts like Slack, Figma, and Box. Hamid, who will join Arcade’s board, draws a parallel between Arcade and the evolution of tools like Slack, which brought a new level of visual and interactive communication to workplaces. “What I love about Arcade is that it’s creating this market where, if you describe the category, it doesn’t sound all that interesting,” he told Fortune. “Enterprise chat doesn’t sound interesting, but when you overlay a great product you can use, it drives some enjoyment—like communicating via Slack ten years ago with colleagues when the alternative was chat inside of Gmail or text messaging. There’s a richness these tools offer… and in the same vein, Arcade is very powerful yet beautiful in the way it helps you tell stories.” And, yeah, there’s an AI angle here—Arcade is currently investing in AI features like synthetic voice, automated translations, and recommendations that enhance the content creation process. But it’s all in the service of something that Clark speaks about more clearly than just about any professional storyteller I know: Precise communication not only matters but also makes a difference in real-world outcomes. “This is a really big statement, but broadly there’s so much happiness in words, but also pain that comes from miscommunication when you hear the wrong set of words,” said Clark. “You hear the right set of words, and you’re inspired and motivated. It really matters because there’s just so much more joy that could come from being measured and thoughtful about words.” To tell a story, you need to learn to hear, listen, and then talk. In its way, Arcade is about learning to speak—and it’s ready to be heard.

Title: QCP Capital: Nasdaq’s Spot Bitcoin ETF Options Launch Signals Institutional Boom
URL: https://www.cryptoglobe.com/latest/2024/11/qcp-capital-nasdaqs-spot-bitcoin-etf-options-launch-signals-institutional-boom/
Time Published: 2024-11-21T10:57:13Z
Full Content:
On 19 November 2024, Nasdaq began listing options on BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF (ticker: IBIT). According to a report by Bloomberg, this launch follows over 10 months of collaboration between Nasdaq, BlackRock, and regulators, including the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Options Clearing Corporation. Alison Hennessy, Nasdaq’s Head of ETP Listings, confirmed the launch, highlighting strong demand from investors seeking greater flexibility in managing Bitcoin exposure. The iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has amassed over $30 billion in assets since its debut, making it the largest spot Bitcoin ETF in the market. Eric Balchunas, an ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, noted that while spot Bitcoin ETFs like IBIT have succeeded on their own merits, the addition of options provides a significant tailwind. Options offer investors a way to express precise views on Bitcoin’s price movement, ultimately driving greater volumes and assets into the product. In a recent blog post, Singapore-based crypto-focused proprietary trading firm and market maker QCP Capital emphasized the broader significance of this launch in their blog post, pointing out how institutional investors could benefit from regulated derivatives tied to IBIT. They noted that spot Bitcoin ETF options could attract a wave of institutions that face barriers to native crypto options platforms like Deribit. QCP Capital said that derivatives in traditional markets often grow to 10-20 times the size of the underlying asset’s market capitalization, and a similar trend could unfold in Bitcoin. Institutions may use these options to generate yield on long-term holdings, potentially compressing implied volatility in Bitcoin markets. Drawing parallels to the growing use of MicroStrategy as a Bitcoin proxy, QCP Capital cited Q3 2024 filings showing a surge in institutional holders of MicroStrategy from 667 to 738. Vanguard alone increased its holdings by nearly 16 million shares—a 1,000% jump. QCP Capital noted that Bitcoin was stabilizing above $90,000, with the December 100k strike holding the highest open interest among IBIT options. Narrowing implied volatility spreads reflect growing confidence in Bitcoin’s trajectory, potentially setting the stage for upward momentum. The firm also pointed to broader trends in institutional adoption, such as Goldman Sachs’ plans to spin off its digital asset platform, as further evidence of the integration of digital assets into traditional finance.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 8 Best Climate Change Stocks To Invest In Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Sunnova Energy International Inc. (NYSE:NOVA) stands against other best climate change stocks. According to a report by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the state of the climate in 2023 was marked by record-breaking levels of greenhouse gas emissions, ocean heat, sea level rise, and extreme weather events. The observed concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide reached record levels in 2022 and continued to increase in 2023. CO2 levels are now 50% higher than in the pre-industrial era, trapping heat in the atmosphere and contributing to the long-term increase in global temperature. The global mean near-surface temperature in 2023 was 1.45°C above the pre-industrial 1850-1900 average, making it the warmest year on record. Sea level rise also continued to accelerate, with global mean sea level reaching a record high in the satellite record (since 1993). This reflects continued ocean warming and the melting of glaciers and ice sheets. The rate of global mean sea level rise in the past ten years (2014-2023) is more than twice the rate of sea level rise in the first decade of the satellite record (1993-2002). Extreme weather and climate events had major socio-economic impacts on all inhabited continents, including major floods, tropical cyclones, extreme heat, and drought. The number of people who are acutely food insecure worldwide has more than doubled, from 149 million people before the COVID-19 pandemic to 333 million people in 2023. Weather and climate hazards continued to trigger displacement, with 1.8 million people displaced across Ethiopia, Burundi, South Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, Somalia, and Kenya in addition to the 3 million people displaced internally or across borders by the five consecutive seasons of drought in Ethiopia, Kenya, Djibouti, and Somalia.

According to a report published by Bloomberg on October 21, hedge funds are increasingly betting against the green economy despite significant global investments in clean energy and green technologies. Analysis of data from Hazeltree, which tracks disclosures from roughly 500 hedge funds, reveals that more funds are net short on green sectors such as solar, electric vehicles (EVs), batteries, and hydrogen than are net long. Conversely, fossil fuel sectors such as oil, gas, and coal have attracted more long bets. This shift reflects skepticism about the profitability and short-term viability of green investments, even as governments and scientists emphasize their necessity for addressing climate change. Higher interest rates have made capital-intensive projects such as offshore wind farms less viable, while geopolitical tensions, particularly around China's dominance in green technology supply chains, have deterred investments in areas like solar energy and EVs. Solar energy has seen a sharp decline, with hedge funds shorting 77% of companies in the Invesco Solar ETF as of the third quarter of 2024, compared to 33% in early 2021, when momentum for the green transition hit a peak. However, US-based companies that avoid reliance on China-dominated technologies, are exceptions. Similarly, the EV and battery sectors have seen a slowdown, with net short positions exceeding longs on 55% of companies in relevant ETFs. Fossil fuels, by contrast, have gained favor. Hedge funds are long on 53% of companies in the S&P Global Oil Index and 73% of major thermal coal companies. Rising global energy consumption and geopolitical instability have bolstered the case for these investments, even as green energy struggles to meet demand reliably. Hedge fund managers argue that fossil fuels remain essential for stable energy supplies. Hedge funds have shown optimism about wind energy, with long bets on nearly 60% of companies in the First Trust Global Wind Energy ETF, supported by growing government orders. Power infrastructure, including transmission grids, has also attracted interest, with long bets outnumbering shorts on 65% of companies in the sector. This sub-sector is considered crucial for meeting increasing electricity demands, including those driven by AI data centers. As the energy landscape continues to evolve, investors are closely watching the impact of the new administration on the renewable energy sector. With the global demand for clean energy on the rise and innovation in renewable technologies driving growth, the sector's long-term outlook remains compelling.

From that list, we narrowed our choices to the 8 stocks that analysts see the most upside to. The list is sorted in ascending order of analysts’ average upside potential, as of November 19. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Upside Potential: 203.56% Sunnova Energy International Inc. (NYSE:NOVA) provides residential solar and energy storage services and is a leading player in the solar PV system market in the United States. The company plays a significant role in the adoption of clean energy by offering customers a range of financing options with 20 to 25-year terms. On October 30, Sunnova Energy International Inc. (NYSE:NOVA) reported financial results for the third quarter and nine months ended on September 30. The company's core business of customer agreements and incentives showed impressive growth, with a 43% increase in revenue to $121.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, compared to the previous year. This growth is driven by an increase in the number of solar energy systems in service, which has risen by 38% to 222,300. Sunnova Energy International Inc. (NYSE:NOVA) has also seen an increase in average revenue per system, with Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) and lease revenue per system rising by 12% to $1,405 per system, driven by slightly larger average system sizes and higher battery attachment rates, which have risen to 32% for the nine months ended September 30. As of September 30, Sunnova Energy International Inc. (NYSE:NOVA) had total cash on the balance of $473.9 million, of which $208.9 million was unrestricted cash and $1 billion was available as borrowing capacity under various debt financing arrangements. Overall, NOVA ranks 1st on our list of best climate change stocks to invest in right now. While we acknowledge the potential of NOVA to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Weather and climate hazards continued to trigger displacement, with 1.8 million people displaced across Ethiopia, Burundi, South Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, Somalia, and Kenya in addition to the 3 million people displaced internally or across borders by the five consecutive seasons of drought in Ethiopia, Kenya, Djibouti, and Somalia.

According to a report published by Bloomberg on October 21, hedge funds are increasingly betting against the green economy despite significant global investments in clean energy and green technologies. Analysis of data from Hazeltree, which tracks disclosures from roughly 500 hedge funds, reveals that more funds are net short on green sectors such as solar, electric vehicles (EVs), batteries, and hydrogen than are net long. Conversely, fossil fuel sectors such as oil, gas, and coal have attracted more long bets. This shift reflects skepticism about the profitability and short-term viability of green investments, even as governments and scientists emphasize their necessity for addressing climate change. Higher interest rates have made capital-intensive projects such as offshore wind farms less viable, while geopolitical tensions, particularly around China's dominance in green technology supply chains, have deterred investments in areas like solar energy and EVs. Solar energy has seen a sharp decline, with hedge funds shorting 77% of companies in the Invesco Solar ETF as of the third quarter of 2024, compared to 33% in early 2021, when momentum for the green transition hit a peak. However, US-based companies that avoid reliance on China-dominated technologies, are exceptions. Similarly, the EV and battery sectors have seen a slowdown, with net short positions exceeding longs on 55% of companies in relevant ETFs. Fossil fuels, by contrast, have gained favor. Hedge funds are long on 53% of companies in the S&P Global Oil Index and 73% of major thermal coal companies. Rising global energy consumption and geopolitical instability have bolstered the case for these investments, even as green energy struggles to meet demand reliably. Hedge fund managers argue that fossil fuels remain essential for stable energy supplies. Hedge funds have shown optimism about wind energy, with long bets on nearly 60% of companies in the First Trust Global Wind Energy ETF, supported by growing government orders. Power infrastructure, including transmission grids, has also attracted interest, with long bets outnumbering shorts on 65% of companies in the sector. This sub-sector is considered crucial for meeting increasing electricity demands, including those driven by AI data centers. As the energy landscape continues to evolve, investors are closely watching the impact of the new administration on the renewable energy sector. With the global demand for clean energy on the rise and innovation in renewable technologies driving growth, the sector's long-term outlook remains compelling.

To compile our list of the 8 best climate change stocks to invest in right now, we sifted through internet rankings to find the 20 largest companies that focus on addressing climate change through their products, services, or operations. From that list, we narrowed our choices to the 8 stocks that analysts see the most upside to. The list is sorted in ascending order of analysts’ average upside potential, as of November 19. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Upside Potential: 95.00% Green Plains Inc. (NASDAQ:GPRE) focuses on producing low-carbon biofuels and renewable products. The company is one of the largest producers of ethanol in the United States, which is used to produce advanced biofuels such as renewable diesel, biodiesel, and sustainable aviation fuel. Green Plains Inc. (NASDAQ:GPRE) plays a critical role in promoting renewable biofuels as a cleaner alternative to traditional fossil fuels. On October 31, Green Plains Inc. (NASDAQ:GPRE) reported financial results for the third quarter that ended on September 30. The company’s ethanol sales volume declined to 220.3 million gallons during the third quarter, compared with 223.5 million gallons for the same period in the prior year. However, the ethanol production segment delivered a notable increase in crush margin, rising to $58.3 million from $52.9 million in the same period last year, driven by operational efficiency and optimization of production processes. On October 28, Green Plains Inc. (NASDAQ:GPRE) announced the successful startup of its Clean Sugar Technology (CST) facility in Iowa. The facility, which is the world's first commercial deployment of CST, has begun producing dextrose syrups with a significantly lower carbon intensity than existing alternatives. The CST system produces dextrose and glucose corn syrups with up to 40% lower carbon intensity than traditional methods. These sustainable ingredients are designed for use in renewable chemicals, bio-based materials, and food and beverage formulations. The facility has already proven successful in trials as a feedstock for fermentation of various bio-products and bio-chemicals, in addition to food ingredients. The Shenandoah facility has achieved third-party certification for current Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs) and is expected to receive FSSC 22000 certification in the next quarter. This certification will further demonstrate the facility's commitment to producing high-quality, sustainable ingredients that meet the needs of its customers. Overall, GPRE ranks 3rd on our list of best climate change stocks to invest in right now. While we acknowledge the potential of GPRE to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GPRE but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 8 Best Climate Change Stocks To Invest In Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Array Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:ARRY) stands against other best climate change stocks. According to a report by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the state of the climate in 2023 was marked by record-breaking levels of greenhouse gas emissions, ocean heat, sea level rise, and extreme weather events. The observed concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide reached record levels in 2022 and continued to increase in 2023. CO2 levels are now 50% higher than in the pre-industrial era, trapping heat in the atmosphere and contributing to the long-term increase in global temperature. The global mean near-surface temperature in 2023 was 1.45°C above the pre-industrial 1850-1900 average, making it the warmest year on record. Sea level rise also continued to accelerate, with global mean sea level reaching a record high in the satellite record (since 1993). This reflects continued ocean warming and the melting of glaciers and ice sheets. The rate of global mean sea level rise in the past ten years (2014-2023) is more than twice the rate of sea level rise in the first decade of the satellite record (1993-2002). Extreme weather and climate events had major socio-economic impacts on all inhabited continents, including major floods, tropical cyclones, extreme heat, and drought.

The company plays a critical role in making solar energy more viable and cost-effective by maximizing solar energy efficiency and reducing dependency on fossil fuels. On November 18, Array Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:ARRY) announced a strategic $3 million investment in Swap Robotics, a pioneer in utility-scale solar robotic operations, maintenance, and automation solutions. The investment in Swap Robotics aligns with the company’s goal of driving automation in the solar industry, particularly in photovoltaic (PV) installation technology.

(NASDAQ:ARRY) has agreed to provide two additional investments of $1 million each if Swap attains certain agreed-upon milestones.

Title: Bitcoin Soars To New Highs Near $95,000: Analyst Reveals Bullish Price Targets Ahead
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-soars-to-new-highs-near-95000-analyst-reveals-bullish-price-targets-ahead/

Bitcoin (BTC) achieved a new record high of $94,730, continuing a significant uptrend that began on November 5. Analysts are dubbing this rally the “Trump trade,” as the recent political developments surrounding Donald Trump’s victory have instilled renewed confidence among investors in BTC and the broader crypto market. Despite the impressive surge, analysts believe Bitcoin’s price discovery is far from complete, indicating substantial potential for further growth. Among those sharing this bullish sentiment is analyst Ali Martinez, who draws parallels between Bitcoin’s current price movements and those seen in December 2020, before the notable uptrend that ultimately led to an all-time high of $69,000 in 2021. Martinez notes that the relative strength index (RSI), a key technical indicator used to gauge momentum, is currently mirroring the patterns observed in late 2020. This similarity suggests that the BTC price may be poised for significant upward movements in the coming months. According to Martinez, if this trend continues, Bitcoin could target the $108,000 mark, followed by a potential correction to around $99,000, before bouncing back to a predicted milestone of $135,000. This forecast represents an increase of over 42% from current levels, although Martinez did not specify a timeline for these movements, indicating they might occur anywhere between now and the first quarter of 2025. In even more optimistic projections, market expert Timothy Peterson, who identifies as a network economist, suggests that Bitcoin’s current bullish trend could persist until November 2025, with ambitious targets set for the future. In a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), Peterson predicted that Bitcoin could reach $275,000 per coin by Thanksgiving Day 2025. He bases this projection on Metcalfe’s Law, which posits that the value of a network is proportional to the square of its number of users. This indicates that as more individuals adopt Bitcoin, its value is likely to increase significantly. Looking further ahead, the economist also asserts that the Bitcoin price could achieve the coveted valuation of $1,000,000 per coin by 2029, representing a staggering 954% increase from current levels. Trading at $94,730 as of this writing, the largest cryptocurrency on the market has seen massive gains in recent weeks, with a 26% and 39% increase in the fourteen and thirty day time frames, respectively. Furthermore, BTC has reached a market cap valuation of $1.8 trillion, making it one of the most valuable assets in the world, currently ranked 7th, just behind companies such as Nvidia, Microsoft, Google and Amazon. But quite far from the leading asset in this matter which is gold with a market cap of $17 trillion.

Title: Energy Transfer (ET): Fueling America’s Future Under $25
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/energy-transfer-et-fueling-america-080349176.html

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 12 Best Stocks Under $25 To Invest In Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Energy Transfer LP (NYSE:ET) stands against other best stocks under $25 to invest in right now. As reported by NPR, the Dow Jones Industrial Average soared to a record high, and so did the Nasdaq and the S&P 500, after Donald Trump’s victory in the 2024 presidential election. Wall Street investors consider this victory beneficial for business interests. While businesses have been victims of excessive regulations under the Biden administration, Trump is expected to ease restrictions and lower taxes. Investors were also glad to see the timely results of the election. Commenting on the scenario, Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist at LPL Financial, stated: “The market’s not only welcoming a Trump victory, but [also] the decisiveness of the victory. The clouds of uncertainty have really parted” With shareholders expecting lighter government oversight of the financial sector, the sector climbed 6.16% and emerged as the best-performing of the eleven major S&P 500 sectors. The S&P 500 bank index was up 10.68%, posting its largest daily jump in two years. Companies issuing credit cards performed especially well. A particular sector that appeared bright after Trump’s win was crypto. The price of Bitcoin rose above $80,000 for the first time ever after the win. Other cryptocurrencies such as dogecoin which is the favorite coin of Elon Musk, a strong Trump supporter, are also posting gains, as reported by BBC. Regarding the future outlook for Bitcoin, Bitwise’s Matt Hougan told CNBC that there is a clear path right up to $100,000 by 2024’s end while $200,000 is completely reasonable for 2025 considering that the trend is up and is going to stay intact for a while. Simultaneously, the conventional energy sector surged keeping in mind the new President’s goal to boost fossil fuel production. However, the clean energy sector suffered with at least half a dozen developers putting projects on hold as many projects await more clarity from the new administration. The new President had stated that he would pull back the unspent funds from Biden’s climate law, calling it a ‘green new scam’. While Trump’s win has been deemed as a setback for climate protection, analysts and activists believe that the transition to cleaner sources of energy will continue regardless, considering the fact that customers and investors want companies to deal with climate change. The economic benefits from new factories and power plants that have received government support can be seen in both states led by Democrats and Republicans. Since Trump has plans to increase tariffs on foreign goods entering the US, the retail stocks that have their products produced outside the country posted declines after the election. However, other retail sector stocks especially department stores and others that derive revenue from issuing branded credit cards joined in on the post-election rally, as reported by Barron’s. To compile a list of the 12 best stocks under $25 to invest in right now, we used the Yahoo stock screener to acquire a list of stocks with the highest market caps and share prices below $25. We then examined analysts’ average upside potential of the shortlisted stocks. Our list is in ascending order of average upside potentials, as of November 18. At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). An oil rig in the middle of the ocean, its towering structure standing stout in the horizon. Average Upside Potential: 15.67% Share Price: $17.29 Energy Transfer LP (NYSE:ET) is one of the largest and most diversified midstream energy companies in North America. The firm is a publicly traded limited partnership with core operations encompassing transportation, storage, and terminalling for natural gas, crude oil, NGLs, refined products, and liquid natural gas. 80 countries and territories receive the firm’s exports. Energy Transfer was formed in 1996.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 12 Best Stocks Under $25 To Invest In Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Itaú Unibanco Holding S.A. (NYSE:ITUB) stands against other best stocks under $25 to invest in right now. As reported by NPR, the Dow Jones Industrial Average soared to a record high, and so did the Nasdaq and the S&P 500, after Donald Trump’s victory in the 2024 presidential election. Wall Street investors consider this victory beneficial for business interests. While businesses have been victims of excessive regulations under the Biden administration, Trump is expected to ease restrictions and lower taxes. Investors were also glad to see the timely results of the election. Commenting on the scenario, Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist at LPL Financial, stated: “The market’s not only welcoming a Trump victory, but [also] the decisiveness of the victory. The clouds of uncertainty have really parted” With shareholders expecting lighter government oversight of the financial sector, the sector climbed 6.16% and emerged as the best-performing of the eleven major S&P 500 sectors. The S&P 500 bank index was up 10.68%, posting its largest daily jump in two years. Companies issuing credit cards performed especially well. A particular sector that appeared bright after Trump’s win was crypto. The price of Bitcoin rose above $80,000 for the first time ever after the win. Other cryptocurrencies such as dogecoin which is the favorite coin of Elon Musk, a strong Trump supporter, are also posting gains, as reported by BBC. Regarding the future outlook for Bitcoin, Bitwise’s Matt Hougan told CNBC that there is a clear path right up to $100,000 by 2024’s end while $200,000 is completely reasonable for 2025 considering that the trend is up and is going to stay intact for a while. Simultaneously, the conventional energy sector surged keeping in mind the new President’s goal to boost fossil fuel production. However, the clean energy sector suffered with at least half a dozen developers putting projects on hold as many projects await more clarity from the new administration. The new President had stated that he would pull back the unspent funds from Biden’s climate law, calling it a ‘green new scam’. While Trump’s win has been deemed as a setback for climate protection, analysts and activists believe that the transition to cleaner sources of energy will continue regardless, considering the fact that customers and investors want companies to deal with climate change. The economic benefits from new factories and power plants that have received government support can be seen in both states led by Democrats and Republicans. Since Trump has plans to increase tariffs on foreign goods entering the US, the retail stocks that have their products produced outside the country posted declines after the election. However, other retail sector stocks especially department stores and others that derive revenue from issuing branded credit cards joined in on the post-election rally, as reported by Barron’s. To compile a list of the 12 best stocks under $25 to invest in right now, we used the Yahoo stock screener to acquire a list of stocks with the highest market caps and share prices below $25. We then examined analysts’ average upside potential of the shortlisted stocks. Our list is in ascending order of average upside potentials, as of November 18. At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

The company is one of the largest Brazilian private banks in market value. Based on market value on October 31, the company serves as the largest bank in Latin America with 100 years of history. The firm’s ability to adapt, innovate, and change has enabled it to achieve the status of a universal bank. Apart from offering the most complete portfolio of financial products and services, the firm serves clients how, when, and where they want to be served being a digital bank with the advantage of in-person service. The firm’s recurring managerial result reached R$10.7 billion in Q3 2024, up 19.4% year-over-year. At the same time, the credit portfolio grew 9.9% year-over-year. Revenues from investment banking operations and brokerage services declined as a result of lower activity in the fixed-income market but were offset by improved revenues from credit card activities, asset management, and higher results from insurance operations. Thus, Itaú Unibanco Holding S.A. (NYSE:ITUB) is a leading universal bank with a rich history, a broad product portfolio, and a dominant position in Latin America. Overall, ITUB ranks 7th on our list of best stocks under $25 to invest in right now.
