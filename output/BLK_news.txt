Belgium blocked consensus on using frozen Russian assets (â¬140 billion/$163 billion) as collateral for Ukraine, demanding stronger legal safeguards. Belgian PM Bart De Wever threatened legal and political resistance unless conditions were met, forcing a watered-down compromise. President Volodymyr Zelensky warned that delays weaken Ukraine's defenses and slow EU progress. Kyiv pledged to spend funds on European weapons and air defenses, but EU leaders postponed final approval until December. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov called any seizure "theft" and vowed legal retaliation. Russia has already seized Euroclearâs assets in response to sanctions and may escalate if the EU moves forward. Experts warn Russia could sue Euroclear in international courts, destabilizing Western finance. If Russia reclaims assets, the U.S. may default on Ukraine-related loans, accelerating dollar decline. The EU's hesitation exposes risks of weaponizing finance, with potential global financial upheaval. Ukraine's financial crisis worsens, with $20 billion in suspended debt payments and no clear funding solution.

The EU's hesitation exposes risks of weaponizing finance, with potential global financial upheaval. Ukraine's financial crisis worsens, with $20 billion in suspended debt payments and no clear funding solution. European Union (EU) leaders have delayed plans to use frozen Russian assets to finance a massive â¬140 billion ($163 billion) loan for Ukraine after Belgium demanded stronger legal safeguards, throwing negotiations into disarray. The move comes as Russia warns of severe financial and legal repercussions if the West proceeds with what Moscow calls outright "theft." At a Brussels summit on Thursday, Oct. 23, EU officials failed to reach an agreement on whether to use immobilized Russian central bank funds as collateral for Ukraine's war effort. Belgium, which holds legal control over the bulk of the frozen assets through Brussels-based Euroclear, insisted that all EU members share responsibility if the plan backfires. Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever took a firm stance, stating:Â "If demands are met, we can go forward. If not, I will do everything in my power at the European level, also at the national level, politically and legally to stop this decision."Â His opposition forced a compromise text that merelyÂ "invites the [EU] Commission to present, as soon as possible, options for financial support,"Â rather than committing to the loan outright. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, attending the summit as a guest, urged immediate approval of the loan, warning that delays would weaken Ukraine's defenses. "Anyone who delays the decision on the full use of frozen Russian assets is not only limiting our defense, but also slowing down the EU's own progress,"Â he said. Kyiv pledged to use much of the funds to purchase European weapons and bolster air defenses. However, EU leaders, wary of legal blowback, postponed a final decision until December. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen acknowledged the complexity, stating:Â "This is a topic that is certainly not trivial. It's very complex." Russia warns of financial and legal repercussions Moscow has repeatedly condemned the West's efforts to repurpose Russian funds, calling it illegal confiscation. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov warned that any seizure wouldÂ "boomerang"Â on the EU, adding:Â "If someone wants to steal our property, our assets, and illegally appropriate them... they will be subjected to legal prosecution one way or another." Russian Deputy Finance Minister Alexei Moiseev reinforced this stance, stating that Moscow has no plans to retaliate against European assetsâunless the EU moves first. "We are not confiscating anything yet. The Europeans haven't called for confiscation, so we won't confiscate anything until they do. If they do end up confiscating, then we will consider it,"Â he said. According to the Enoch AI engine at BrightU.AI,Â Russia's stance on the EU's plan to seize frozen Russian assets is one of strong opposition and condemnation, viewing it as a brazen act of theft and a violation of international law. Russia's stance is clear and resolute: it views the move as a violation of international law and a hostile act that it will not tolerate. Russia has taken countermeasures and threatened further action to protect its assets and economy. Legal experts warn that Russia could sue Euroclear in international courts, potentially reclaiming seized assets and destabilizing Western finance. Financial analyst Jim Rickards has cautioned that such a scenario could trigger a crisis, exposing the West'sÂ "theft scheme"Â and leaving financial institutions scrambling. Broader implications: A financial and geopolitical quagmire The stalled EU plan underscores deeper concerns about Ukraine's financial viability. Reports indicate Kyiv is already on the brink of default, withÂ 20 billion in suspended debt payments to investors like BlackRock. Meanwhile, the U.S. faces its own dilemmaâif Russia successfully reclaims frozen assets, Washington may default on obligations tied to Ukraine's 50 billion loan, accelerating the dollar's decline. As the EU scrambles for a legally defensible solution, the standoff highlights the growing risks of weaponizing finance in geopolitical conflicts. With no clear resolution in sight, the fate of Ukraine's fundingâand the stability of Western financial systemsâhangs in the balance. The EU's hesitation reveals a stark reality: The West's financial warfare against Russia may carry unforeseen consequences. As legal doubts mount and Moscow prepares its counterstrike, the global financial order teeters on the edge of upheavalâone that could redefine power dynamics far beyond Ukraine's battlefields. EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas says Russia will not regain frozen assets without paying reparations to Ukraine.Â Watch this video. This video is from theÂ The Prisoner channel on Brighteon.com.

Sources include: RT.com TheStraitsTimes.com Reuters.com BrightU.ai Brighteon.com Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, attending the summit as a guest, urged immediate approval of the loan, warning that delays would weaken Ukraine's defenses. "Anyone who delays the decision on the full use of frozen Russian assets is not only limiting our defense, but also slowing down the EU's own progress,"Â he said. Kyiv pledged to use much of the funds to purchase European weapons and bolster air defenses. However, EU leaders, wary of legal blowback, postponed a final decision until December. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen acknowledged the complexity, stating:Â "This is a topic that is certainly not trivial. It's very complex." Russia warns of financial and legal repercussions Moscow has repeatedly condemned the West's efforts to repurpose Russian funds, calling it illegal confiscation. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov warned that any seizure wouldÂ "boomerang"Â on the EU, adding:Â "If someone wants to steal our property, our assets, and illegally appropriate them... they will be subjected to legal prosecution one way or another." Russian Deputy Finance Minister Alexei Moiseev reinforced this stance, stating that Moscow has no plans to retaliate against European assetsâunless the EU moves first. "We are not confiscating anything yet. The Europeans haven't called for confiscation, so we won't confiscate anything until they do. If they do end up confiscating, then we will consider it,"Â he said. According to the Enoch AI engine at BrightU.AI,Â Russia's stance on the EU's plan to seize frozen Russian assets is one of strong opposition and condemnation, viewing it as a brazen act of theft and a violation of international law. Russia's stance is clear and resolute: it views the move as a violation of international law and a hostile act that it will not tolerate. Russia has taken countermeasures and threatened further action to protect its assets and economy. Legal experts warn that Russia could sue Euroclear in international courts, potentially reclaiming seized assets and destabilizing Western finance. Financial analyst Jim Rickards has cautioned that such a scenario could trigger a crisis, exposing the West'sÂ "theft scheme"Â and leaving financial institutions scrambling. Broader implications: A financial and geopolitical quagmire The stalled EU plan underscores deeper concerns about Ukraine's financial viability. Reports indicate Kyiv is already on the brink of default, withÂ 20 billion in suspended debt payments to investors like BlackRock. Meanwhile, the U.S. faces its own dilemmaâif Russia successfully reclaims frozen assets, Washington may default on obligations tied to Ukraine's 50 billion loan, accelerating the dollar's decline. As the EU scrambles for a legally defensible solution, the standoff highlights the growing risks of weaponizing finance in geopolitical conflicts. With no clear resolution in sight, the fate of Ukraine's fundingâand the stability of Western financial systemsâhangs in the balance.

Title: Utility bills spike as power-hungry AI data centers boom, Bank of America report finds
URL: https://nypost.com/2025/10/24/business/utility-bills-spike-as-ai-data-centers-boom-bank-of-america-report/

The rapid rollout of power-hungry AI data centers could be straining the US energy grid and causing utility bills to spike – and prices could get worse in the coming months, according to economists. Americans spent 3.6% more on electricity and gas in the third quarter of this year than they did during the same time last year, according to a study led by Bank of America economist David Tinsley. Taking a longer view, electricity prices rose 5.1% over the past 12 months through September, while gas service went up a whopping 11.7%, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said Friday. That came as the feds and state governments have been offering financial incentives for companies to build data centers. There are over 4,000 such sites throughout the US today, according to datacentermap.com, though there is no official count. “The rising demand for electricity generation capacity and grid investments, due in part to the build-out of data centers, appears to be placing more upward pressure on bills,” stated the Bank of America report, which was released last week. When electrical grids get enhanced to accommodate increased power demands from new data centers, at least some of the cost appears to get passed on to consumers, the report explained. On top of that, the increased use of electric vehicles has added to electricity demand, helping to keep prices high, according to the study. More price hikes could be in store this winter. “Consumers may again feel the pressure on their utility bills in the coming months, particularly if the winter is a cold one,” BofA’s report warned. Electricity and natural gas prices actually ticked down slightly from August to September, according to the Consumer Price Index, though that’s likely due to consumers flipping off the A/C and waiting to turn on the heat. Meanwhile, expanding the US power grid faces a number of barriers, with massive amounts of capital needed to build “more generation and transmission capacity,” the BofA report stated. Regulatory hurdles and supply chain pressures also pose a roadblock, according to the analysis, who pointed to difficulties acquiring large turbines. BofA warned that higher utility bills could hammer overall consumer spending. Americans are already concerned about higher prices, sinking consumer sentiment to a five-month low in October, according to a University of Michigan report released Friday. Average utility payments over the summer varied by city. Chicago and Tampa, Fla., for example, saw much higher bills, while prices dropped in Las Vegas. It was notably hot this summer in parts of Phoenix – so prices increased alongside the demand for cooling, the study said. Higher utility bills also tend to disproportionately hit lower-income households, which are already dealing with slower wage growth, according to BofA’s report. Despite intense pressure on the grid, tech giants have continued to announce massive investments in AI infrastructure. Just last week, a group of investors including Nvidia, Microsoft, BlackRock and Elon Musk’s xAI agreed to purchase Aligned Data Centers for $40 billion.t Earlier this year, President Trump announced that SoftBank, OpenAI and Oracle plan to invest $500 billion in AI infrastructure over the next four years through the Stargate project.

Title: Ripple effect of provincial call-ups adds intrigue to this weekend’s AIL action

The ripple effect of the four provinces all dipping deep into their reserves while the Ireland squad is in Chicago is that some All-Ireland League clubs have been obliged to do likewise. For example, Terenure beat Lansdowne with an impressive display under lights on the Aviva back pitch a couple of weeks ago in an encounter which was much more competitive than the final 34-13 score line indicated. Evidence of the game’s high quality is that Leinster have picked three of the Lansdowne starting XV – prop Jerry Cahir, hooker Bobby Sheehan and fullback Hugo McLoughlin – to face Zebre, as well as the Terenure pair of outhalf Caspar Gabriel and hooker John McKee. New signing Julien Valleise will make his third league start for Lansdowne in the front row away to Young Munster, while Sean Galvin and Tom Roche feature in the back three, with Todd Lawlor reverting to fullback. Evan O’Connell, Ruadhan Quinn, Shay McCarthy, and Jake O’Riordan are on Munster duty, so Harry Langbridge, Orin Burke, John Poland, Christian Foley, Oran O’Reilly, and Stephen McLoughlin come in to the Cookies team. After three one-score defeats, and a couple of attacking bonus points, Young Munster will be striving for a win. Ditto for Lansdowne after losing two of their first three outings. Terenure have their first home game under Carlos Spencer against newly-promoted Nenagh Ormond, who will be making their first-ever visit to Lakelands Park. Spencer makes six changes, Leinster under-19 talent Arthur Ashmore coming in to the back row. Nenagh came up just short of a first point in Division 1A in losing 25-17 to Cork Con a fortnight ago. Munster prop Roman Salanoa will make his first start for the club, while Argentinian Mateo Sentous, Jake O’Kelly and John O’Flaherty have also been added to the pack. Alex Usanov’s Leinster call-up has contributed to one of Clontarf’s three changes for their first visit to Old Belvedere in nine years, with Ivan Soroka, Ben Griffin and Jim Peters returning to the tight five. Hugh Flood replaces Hugo O’Malley in Belvo’s only change. St Mary’s, the only unbeaten team after three rounds, travel to UCD with all their big guns in situ, with Aaron O’Neill and Leandro Ramirez added to their back three. Centre Ben Brownlee returns from a spell with North Harbour in the NPC for UCD, who also welcome back Leinster Academy lock Conor O’Tighearnaigh. Cork Constitution, who sit second after successive wins, host free-scoring Ballynahinch, who are third after Ethan Graham’s six-try salvo last time out against UCD. Old Wesley, the only team with three wins in Division 1B, travel north to last season’s champions Instonians. Leinster Academy flyer Paidi Farrell will make his first start of the new season for Wesley, while Ulster’s John Andrew will make his debut for the home side. The 2B leaders Galwegians host fourth-placed Malone, just a point behind them, at Crowley Park. Galwegians also top the women’s league and take that unbeaten record to eighth-placed Cooke. All-Ireland League fixtures: (Saturday, 2.30pm unless stated) Division 1A: Cork Constitution v Ballynahinch, Temple Hill; Old Belvedere v Clontarf, Ollie Campbell Park; Terenure College v Nenagh Ormond, Lakelands Park; UCD v St Mary’s College, Belfield; Young Munster v Lansdowne, Tom Clifford Park.

Title: Did Trump agree to 'bail out' Argentina? Unpacking the claim
URL: https://www.snopes.com//news/2025/10/24/trump-argentina-bailout/
Time Published: 2025-10-24T17:51:00Z
Full Content:
During the U.S. federal government shutdown in October 2025, rumors spread that President Donald Trump sent a multibillion-dollar "bailout" to help stabilize Argentina's economy using taxpayers' money. For example, House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries commented on the alleged bailout in a statement to the press on Oct. 15 (archived): It's perplexing to us that Republicans refuse to spend a dime to protect the healthcare of the American people, but somehow the Trump administration found $40 billion to bail out a right-wing wannabe dictator in Argentina in ways that are also going to continue to hurt our soybean farmers in Iowa and in the Midwest. That's outrageous. This is corruption in real time. Critics lambasted the purported deal, with some saying the money would have been better spent paying air traffic controllers or government-covered health care costs during the shutdown. An anti-corruption nonprofit RepresentUs claimed on X the move benefited wealthy U.S. investors who supposedly bet on Argentina's economic success such as Robert Citrone, of Discovery Capital Management, an alleged close acquaintance to U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent (archived). (Snopes unpacks the origin and facts of that specific assertion, below.) It is true that the U.S. government said it agreed to help stabilize Argentina's economy with billion-dollar funding packages. First, it said it agreed to sending $20 billion and then it said it aimed to double that number. The Trump administration said on Oct. 9 that it had pledged the money, according to an X post by Bessent. The government inked the agreement on Oct. 20, according to another post by Bessent and a statement by Argentina's central bank. The administration said the move was strategic, tying it to an effort to maintain influence over Argentina — the Americas' southernmost country — against China. Some critics of the Trump administration framed the bailout as a gift using taxpayer dollars, and financial experts described the deal as unusually risky for the U.S. considering Argentina's history of defaulting on loans, per a Wall Street Journal report. In reality, the deal was a loan in the form of a currency swap. The money would come from the Exchange Stabilization Fund (ESF), an account the Treasury Department can use for emergencies without congressional approval. Further, the administration said half the money would come from private lenders, not the U.S. government. After agreeing to send the initial $20 billion, Bessent said the Trump administration pledged an additional $20 billion from the "private sector," such as banks and investors, as reputable news outlets such as The Wall Street Journal, NBC News and the The Associated Press have reported. Whether Argentina actually receives the money was uncertain, as of this writing. After the Trump administration announced the aid package, Trump said his government would only help the country if the party of Argentina President Javier Milei, a Trump ally, won the country's midterm legislative election on Oct. 26. Also, it was unclear whether banks would supply their half. Snopes contacted Argentina's central bank, the U.S. Treasury Department and the White House about details in this report, and we will update our reporting if we receive responses. Argentina defaulted on its debt nine times in its history, most recently in 2001, 2014 and 2020. In December 2023, Argentina elected Milei, who outlined during his presidential campaign a libertarian program to supposedly fix the country's longstanding economic woes. Milei promised to shrink the government, cut spending and get inflation under control. Milei took office and slashed spending on infrastructure, civil servant wages and welfare, among other things. Initially, his reforms fueled optimism, which led foreign investors — including Citrone — to bet on the country's economic recovery. Milei's policies brought the country's inflation rate from 211% in 2023 to 117.8% in 2024, according to Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria (BBVA), a Spanish bank. After the economy contracted in 2023 and 2024, it grew in 2025. As of this writing, growth projections for 2025 ranged from 4% (BBVA) to 4.6% (World Bank). But economic uncertainty returned when Milei lost popularity among voters after his austerity measures resulted in a historically high poverty rate and a corruption scandal engulfed his sister, Karina Milei. As a result, his party, La Libertad Avanza, lost ground in Buenos Aires' provincial election on Sept. 7, 2025. Voters will next decide on the fate of Milei's party during the country's midterm legislative election on Oct. 26. The election results will determine Milei's ability to follow his plans for budget reform. The outcome of the Sept. 7, 2025, election triggered a panic in financial markets. Investors began selling Argentine assets, including the peso. The value of the peso dropped so sharply, the situation forced Argentina's government to sell nearly $700 million to prevent the currency from falling further. (Buying the peso with dollars helps increase its value.) That defensive move by Argentina's government depleted foreign-exchange reserves. In September 2025, the U.S. government stepped in to assist the Argentine government in its attempt to support the currency (archived): Bessent said in another post (archived) that the U.S. could help stabilize Argentina with tools such as "swap lines" and "direct currency purchases." Bessent said that "opportunities for private investments remain expansive." After Bessent's announcement, Argentine stocks soared. Weeks later, officials from the two countries met at the White House and agreed to a currency swap. In such a deal, one country uses its currency to buy the currency of another (the one that needs help). In this case, the U.S. agreed to buy pesos with dollars. The country that receives the help must buy back its currency before an agreed date. Currency swaps are loans, not gifts. On Oct. 9, Bessent announced the agreement on X, saying the Treasury had already bought pesos (archived): In that post, he said the U.S. purchased pesos directly, and that the two countries agreed to a $20 billion currency swap with Argentina's central bank. On Oct. 17, Bessent said the U.S. bought more pesos the day before, without giving a specific total. (archived): On Oct. 20, Argentina's central bank announced it had signed the deal with the U.S. The central bank's statement read: The agreement sets forth the terms and conditions for the implementation of bilateral currency swap operations between the two parties. Such operations will allow the BCRA [Banco Central de la República Argentina] to expand its set of monetary and exchange rate policy instruments, including the liquidity of its international reserves, in accordance with the regulatory functions established in its Charter. A day later, Bessent posted on X that this deal with Argentina was "a bridge to a better economic future for Argentina, not a bailout" (archived). Much was unknown about the deal, as of this writing. Neither party has shared specific terms to which they have supposedly agreed. They have not said when Argentina would have to buy back its pesos, nor have they reported the amount the U.S. has already purchased. We asked for those details in our inquiries to the Treasury Department, White House and Argentina's central bank. Money for this bailout would come from the U.S.'s ESF, which, as of August 2025, had a bit more than $43 billion available, federal records show. The U.S. government used the ESF once before to support a foreign government in trouble. That happened in 1995, when then-President Bill Clinton failed to obtain congressional approval to bail out Mexico during its peso crisis. But unlike the 2025 situation with Argentina, the U.S. did not rescue Mexico, a close trading partner, on its own. Clinton worked with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), an organization of 191 countries dedicated to helping nations regain economic stability when they can't finance themselves through usual means. The IMF imposed strict conditions on Clinton's aid package to Mexico. In the case with Argentina, the Trump administration agreed to the aid package without IMF backing and did not publicly outline conditions for repayment, as of this writing. Bessent said in the Oct. 9 X post Argentine Economy Minister Luis Caputo promised the government would maintain strict budgetary policies, following the IMF's conditions for repaying that organization money. The IMF has been supporting Argentina for years. The organization announced in April 2025 its 23rd scheme to support the country's finances. As of this writing, the country owes the IMF $57 billion (41.8 billion in special drawing rights (SDR), the IMF's monetary unit), the highest amount any country has owed the lender. The IMF expects the countries it supports to implement policies to rebalance their budgets, often leading to austerity measures. Argentina has made similar agreements with other governments before. In 2020, Argentina arranged an $18 billion currency swap with China, $5 billion of which Argentina activated in 2024 and renewed in 2025. (That happened despite the fact Milei called China an "assassin" state during his 2023 presidential campaign.) After Trump imposed tariffs on Chinese products in 2025, China — the world's biggest importer of soybeans that, under usual conditions, buys them from the U.S. — started relying more on Argentina for the product. This angered U.S. farmers. The Trump administration saw this rapprochement between Argentina and China as a threat. Asked if he was trying to "drive a wedge" between the two countries, Trump defended the U.S.'s support of Argentina as a strategy to maintain influence in the Latin American country. During the Oct. 14 meeting between Trump and Milei, Trump said, as part of the 2025 deal, Argentina should end its currency swap agreement with China. Economic experts reportedly expressed worry over the U.S.'s risk in offering the line of credit to Argentina, especially since some believe the country should let its currency depreciate rather than let it fluctuate within a tight band against the dollar. For example, The Wall Street Journal quoted Brad Setser, a former Treasury official under former President Barack Obama, as saying, "Should the peso depreciate, which many think is not only likely but necessary, the Treasury would be left holding assets that have fallen in value," after the currency swap with Argentina. In other words, Setser said the U.S. may not recover the entirety of the loan. In the same article, The Wall Street Journal reported concerns among IMF officials that the U.S. would demand repayment of the bailout before Argentina repays the IMF the $57 billion it owes. We asked for responses to these concerns in our inquiries to the White House, Treasury Department and Argentina's central bank. Also, whether private lenders will pull through on their portion of the Trump administration's declaration to help Argentina remained unknown. On Oct. 20, The Wall Street Journal reported that banks including JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Citigroup were having difficulty finding collateral or obtaining guarantees from the U.S. government for the loan to Argentina, and that that portion of the deal may not happen as a result. Snopes contacted those four banks to independently verify The Wall Street Journal's reporting. Citigroup and Goldman Sachs declined to comment, and the others did not respond. Claims about wealthy investors supporting the U.S.-Argentina currency swap for their own financial gain stemmed from reports about Bessent's alleged ties to banks. Citrone, of Discovery Capital Management, was in touch with Bessent before he announced the deal, The New York Times reported, citing two anonymous sources. (Due to the anonymity of those sources, Snopes was unable to track them down for independent verification.) Meanwhile, Bloomberg News reported that Citrone increased his investment in Argentine bonds in early September 2025, before the aid package announcement. The New York Times named investment funds the bailout package would supposedly benefit, including PIMCO, Fidelity and BlackRock, and claimed the deal would favor investor Stanley Druckenmiller's interests. He, Bessent and Citrone reportedly worked together for billionaire George Soros' investment fund, though there was no verified evidence to definitively confirm that history. Snopes reached out to these investors for confirmation. Citrone's Discovery Capital declined to comment. In an interview with CNBC, Bessent dismissed the claim that the government agreed to the bailout package to help wealthy U.S. investors. The Oct. 26 midterm legislative elections in Argentina could affect the deal between the country and U.S. In the Oct. 14 meeting with Milei, Trump indiciated the U.S. would not go through with the deal if Milei's party loses on Oct. 26. "If he [Milei] does win, we're going to be very helpful," Trump said. "And if he doesn't win, we're not going to waste our time because you have somebody whose philosophy has no chance of making Argentina great again." We asked the White House if Trump intends to make good on this threat. Aldaya, Francisco. "Exclusive: Rob Citrone Says Argentina Will Lead Golden Decade for Latin America."

Title: How XRP’s renewed role is driving crypto-fiat settlement and innovation worldwide

Ripple's XRP Ledger emerges as a cornerstone for blockchain payments, boasting compliance and institutional integration in major markets Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. For nearly a decade, XRP has been the underdog of the digital-asset world, overshadowed by Bitcoin’s narrative dominance, Ethereum’s developer gravity, and Solana’s speed headlines. Yet while most of the market debated ETFs and exchange listings, XRP’s core network, the XRP Ledger (XRPL), kept quietly evolving in the background. It is now re-emerging as an infrastructure layer blockchain network that powers real-world payments, stablecoins, and the early wave of tokenized assets. Ripple’s long regulatory standoff ended in August 2025, closing a chapter that defined much of XRP’s last decade. A US court confirmed that XRP’s retail sales are not securities, while Ripple paid a $125 million civil penalty to settle institutional violations. With both sides dropping appeals, the decision gave Ripple the legal certainty it lacked for so many years. That clarity has allowed Ripple to secure over 40 US money-transmitter licenses, including New York, Texas, and California, granting it a nationwide footprint for crypto-fiat settlement. The effect has been immediate as XRP could finally integrate with regulated payment partners, which is something few US-linked blockchains can do. Behind those regulatory wins, the XRP Ledger itself began to show new life. Transactions tied to payment and treasury activity have risen sharply, reflecting renewed interest from financial institutions that once kept their distance. In regions like Africa and Southeast Asia, where stablecoins have become the default rail for remittances, XRPL is now positioning itself as a compliance-ready alternative to Tron and other permissionless networks. One clear example of this real-world comeback is the level of institutional adoption the blockchain enjoys globally. In September, SBI Group and Tobu Top Tours reportedly unveiled plans to issue prepaid travel tokens on the XRPL in Japan. Speaking on the importance of the move, Ripple’s Tatsuya Kohrogi noted: “This is significant as the market in Japan for prepaid payment instruments is $200 billion annually. The tokens will circulate in regional economic zones, from tourist hotspots to sports communities, driving local spending and digital innovation.” According to the Nikkei report, each token functions like a digital prepaid card, redeemable at local stores and tourism hubs. Users can top up with yen, spend instantly, and cash out without intermediaries. For a market where prepaid instruments already handle about $200 billion a year, moving those flows to XRPL represents one of the largest blockchain integrations attempted in a major economy. Essentially, the goal isn’t crypto speculation; it’s infrastructure modernization. By building on XRPL’s low-fee, high-throughput ledger, Japan is testing how digital tokens can drive cashless tourism and local commerce while fully complying with financial regulations. Another project, from Webus International, pushes XRP’s utility even further. The Singapore-based company is developing a tokenized travel-rewards exchange using XRPL’s stablecoin framework to link airline miles, hotel points, and retail loyalty credits. This market is worth nearly $100 billion worldwide. Webus plans to turn those isolated reward systems into transferable digital assets. Tokenizing balances lets consumers swap or redeem them across brands in real time, unlocking liquidity that loyalty programs have historically trapped. This also presents a subtle example of XRP’s renewed role in connecting previously closed financial systems without breaking compliance. Another clear evidence of XRPL’s growth is its growing footprint across the stablecoin and real-world asset (RWA) tokenization markets. Ripple, through its RLUSD stablecoin, is competing directly in the over $300 billion stablecoin market. While the RLUSD’s $898 million market capitalization pales in comparison to the billions of Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC, the digital asset has gained significant institutional usage. For context, crypto exchange Bullish recently disclosed that it used the stablecoin asset and others to settle its $1.15 billion IPO proceeds. This can be linked to RLUSD’s unique design, which prioritizes strict KYC and AML standards. Moreover, Ripple’s recent acquisition of firms like Hidden Road and Rail provides RLUSD an advantage over others, ensuring its reserves and distribution stay inside licensed channels. The compliance angle also differentiates XRPL from rival blockchain networks like Tron and Solana by embedding regulation into the network. Earlier this month, XRPL introduced the Multi-Purpose Token (MPT) Standard, which allows digital asset issuers to limit transfers to verified holders through decentralized identifiers and verifiable credentials. That means every compliant stablecoin or tokenized asset can enforce regulatory controls directly at the protocol level, and no third-party filter is required. Martin Hiesboeck, the Head of Research at Uphold, said: “The MPT standard strategically positions the XRPL as the leading secure and compliant institutional blockchain for the future of tokenized finance.” This architecture is now attracting a mix of stablecoin issuers and financial institutions. Stablecoins like Circle’s USDC, EURØP, USDB, and XSGD all added XRPL support in 2025, signaling confidence in the network’s scalability and compliance-ready tools. Meanwhile, that vision extends well beyond stablecoins. Ripple’s roadmap positions XRPL as a base layer for RWA tokenization, which involves everything from US Treasuries to commercial credit products. This has already seen significant adoption from global authorities like Dubai and major financial institutions like Guggenheim and BlackRock. As a result, the blockchain network now ranks among the top 10 chains for RWA tokenization, handling more than $360 million in assets. Considering this level of adoption, crypto researcher Rob Cunningham concluded: “In a conservative “base case” [XRPL is] a serious corridor player and RWA registry/settlement layer; On the upside, it’s a GO-TO ledger for Stablecoin-settled cross-border Treasury and high-grade RWA settlement with MULT-TRILLION ANNUAL THROUGHPUT by 2030.” Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

Title: Restricting Capital Investment Is A Losing Energy Strategy
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/waynewinegarden/2025/10/24/restricting-capital-investment-is-a-losing-energy-strategy/
Time Published: 2025-10-24T16:29:58Z
Full Content:
ByWayne Winegarden, Contributor. The U.S. energy grid stands at a crossroads. It is facing an unprecedented rise in electricity demand driven in no small part by the growth of artificial intelligence and high-tech manufacturing. Simultaneously, supply is being curtailed by growing power plant retirements. It doesn’t take an advanced degree in economics to foresee the consequences. Policy makers are scrambling for answers before the inevitable power shortages and skyrocketing prices kick in. But for every potential solution that would ease the grid’s strain – keeping plants online, expediting permitting reviews and cutting bureaucratic red tape – policy actions are being taken that would damage energy industries’ ability to attract and utilize capital investment. Last year, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) considered and then held off on changing its long standing blanket authorization policy for investment firms. The current rule requires investment firms to receive FERC approval for purchasing a utility company’s securities only when acquiring more than $10 million worth. The commission was contemplating whether this so-called blanket authorization level is too generous. Of particular concern were investment managers’ passive investment strategies – think index funds – that require these investors to continue allocate a set percentage of their assets into utilities and energy companies. Increasing the stringency of the blanket authorization would have adversely impacted the U.S. energy industry. At the time, I warned that creating “additional investment barriers” would hurt utilities’ ability “to raise the necessary capital,” hindering their ability to “expand capacity and improve the current energy infrastructure.” Thankfully the FERC agreed. As then-FERC Chairman Mark Christie wrote, while BlackRock’s environmental advocacy raises concerns, “public utilities face already large and still growing capital needs, including to fund investment in greatly needed utility assets, such as power generation.” Given these capital needs, and BlackRock’s pledge “not to use its holdings to influence utility management,” extending BlackRock’s blanket authorization will help ensure the utility sector has access to the resources it needs to continue expanding the grid’s capacity Having just dodged that bullet, a new threat to increased energy investment threatens to do the same – a lawsuit led by the Attorney General of Texas. The lawsuit alleges Vanguard, BlackRock, and State Street conspired to artificially depress the coal market through anti-competitive practices. The lawsuit is a response to these investment manager’s investments in coal companies given their public support and past membership in these same environmental organizations, which are promoting policies that are detrimental to the coal industry. As I have previously argued, the asset manager’s support of these environmental, social, and governance (ESG) policies is troubling and creates significant conflicts of interest between the asset managers fiduciary responsibilities and their ESG commitments. However, in practice, the AG actions will simply restrict the coal industry’s ability to raise capital – clearly contradicting the AG’s stated purpose. As the FERC decision emphasizes, prioritizing the need for an efficient allocation of capital is essential if the U.S. grid is going to deliver Americans cheap and plentiful electricity. The lawsuit also fails to account for fundamental market changes created by the fracking revolution. This market-driven innovation increased the supply – and subsequently drove down the costs – of natural gas. Relatively cheaper and lower-emission natural gas radically changed the economics of electricity generation. It is mostly thanks to relatively cheaper natural gas that coal operations have decreased across the country. In 2005, coal was the largest source for electricity, generating about 50 percent of the nation’s electricity. Natural gas generated roughly 19 percent. Over the latest 12 months, natural gas accounted for 42 percent of total generation while coal accounted for a mere 16 percent; their shares of electricity generation have swapped. This reversal of generation share was fostered by over 100 coal-fired plants that were converted to, or replaced by, natural gas-fired plants between 2011 and 2019. As the energy generation mix shifted towards natural gas and other technologies, coal’s downstream consumption and production subsequently declined. Although Attorney General Paxton claims to be protecting the coal industry, if the lawsuit is successful these investment firms would likely be forced to divest their holdings in the coal companies listed in the suit. This forced liquidation will deny the coal industry access to a significant source of capital. According to an analysis by the American Council for Capital Formation’s chief economist, the forced divestments would deny the collective coal industry more than $17.5 billion in capital. This downstream effect stands in stark contrast to the needs of the energy sector, which needs significantly more capital investment to keep up with our energy infrastructure. Ultimately addressing the expected growth in electricity demand will require more capital investment in energy production, transportation, and infrastructure. Cutting off investment sources – whether through FERC rule making or AG lawsuits – increases the likelihood of future blackouts and higher costs for consumers. If the goal is to promote widespread prosperity, such actions are simply the wrong policy path.

© THE INTERCEPT ALL RIGHTS RESERVED In the final days of the NYC mayoral race, the Democratic Party faces a choice between a future defined by Zohran Mamdani or Andrew Cuomo. New York City is on the cusp of an election in which what once looked impossible has begun to seem inevitable. Zohran Mamdani, a democratic socialist member of the New York state Assembly, is heavily favored to beat Andrew Cuomo, New York’s onetime Democratic governor and a former icon of the party establishment, in a race for mayor that has become among the most-watched in the nation. Cuomo and Mamdani articulate two vastly different visions for New York City — and where the Democratic Party is going overall. This week on The Intercept Briefing, Akela Lacy speaks to people hoping to see each of those two visions fulfilled. “Traditionally, we’ve thought about politics as left, right, and center,” says Alyssa Cass, a Democratic strategist who has worked on local and national campaigns. “Zohran offered a message that was less about ideology and more about disrupting a failed status quo that is working for almost no one.” Cass, who worked on Andrew Yang’s mayoral campaign in 2021, isn’t working for Mamdani but says his candidacy indicates “that Democrats can win when we have ideas.” In the view of Jim Walden, a former mayoral candidate who is now backing Cuomo, those ideas are “dangerous and radical policies.” He says Mamdani’s popularity is an indication that “there’s going to be a flirtation with socialism and maybe some populist push” among Democrats. But “ultimately,” Walden says, “the party will come back closer to the center.” Chi Ossé, a City Council member who endorsed Mamdani, sees Mamdani’s success as evidence of the opposite. “We could have gone back to or continued this trend of electing centrist, moderate Democrats,” Ossé says. Instead, he thinks that New Yorkers want “someone who ran as a loud and proud democratic socialist who has always fought on the left.” While New York City is preparing for a general election, Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa is unlikely to win — turning the race almost into a second Democratic primary. “The party is now confronted with a choice,” says Lacy, “between a nominee who has become the new face of generational change in politics and a former governor fighting for his political comeback. The results could reveal where the party’s headed in next year’s midterms and beyond.” Listen to the full conversation of The Intercept Briefing on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you listen. Akela Lacy: Welcome to The Intercept Briefing. I’m Akela Lacy. There’s less than two weeks left before New Yorkers elect their next mayor. The race has drawn national attention — both from President Donald Trump and from observers who see it as a reckoning over the future of the Democratic Party. PIX11 News: Zohran Mamdani continues to hold an insurmountable lead over former Gov. Andrew Cuomo in the race for New York City mayor, as long as Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa stays in it. AL: Even though New York Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani decisively won the Democratic primary in June, the general election has pretty much boiled down to a contest between two candidates trying to claim the Democratic mantle. There’s Mamdani — the party’s nominee — and former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who resigned in 2021 amid sexual harassment allegations that he now denies and has been chasing the mayoralty as his political comeback. Since he lost the primary, Cuomo’s running on an independent ballot line called “Fight and Deliver,” but he’s still pitching himself as a Democrat. There’s also Curtis Sliwa — the founder of the Guardian Angels, Republican candidate, and a thorn in the side of those who want him out of the race to clear a lane on the right for Cuomo. That’s the position of billionaires like John Catsimatidis and Bill Ackman, who have been pushing to get Sliwa out. Curtis Sliwa: Come on Ackman, stay in your lane. Does he know anything about politics? No. Does he live in New York City? No. He lives in Chappaqua, the whitest suburb of America, where even the lawn jockeys are white. AL: It’s also the position of President Trump. Donald Trump: We don’t need a communist in this country. But if we have one, I’m going to be watching over him very carefully, on behalf of the nation. AL: The Trump administration already got its wish when current New York City Mayor Eric Adams dropped out of the race last month, and the conventional wisdom was that many Adams supporters would flock to Cuomo. But after a federal corruption indictment that disappeared when Trump swept into office — remember that? — Adams’s support was already plummeting. And with Sliwa unlikely to become mayor himself, the race is really seen as a contest between Mamdani and Cuomo. Now, Mamdani and Cuomo represent two possible paths the Democratic Party could take: a democratic socialist who was once deemed too far to the left to pull off a primary and is now heavily favored to win the general versus a former Democratic governor who can count the Republican president in his camp. What does the saga say about the state of Democratic politics across the nation? That question is facing Democrats at a time when the national party is still finding itself after a crushing loss that returned Donald Trump to the White House. Two years before that, a humiliating performance in the 2022 midterms threw the New York state Democratic Party into crisis, when Democrats in the state lost congressional seats and helped hand Republicans control of the House of Representatives. In the state that gave us both insurgent leader Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the two top Democrats in Congress — Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries — the party is now confronted with a choice between a nominee who has become the new face of generational change in politics and a former governor fighting for his political comeback. The results could reveal where the party’s headed in next year’s midterms and beyond. So today, we’re going to talk to people hoping to see each of those two visions fulfilled. First, we’ll hear from a City Council member backing Mamdani and a Democratic strategist who’s been following the race but isn’t working for any campaign. And after the break, we’ll hear from a former mayoral candidate who dropped out and endorsed Cuomo, saying he doesn’t want to see the Democratic Party veer toward socialism. Joining me now is Chi Ossé. He’s the Council Member for New York City’s 36th District. He endorsed Mamdani in April. Welcome to the show, Council Member Ossé. Chi Ossé: Thank you so much for having me on. AL: Also joining us is Alyssa Cass, a Democratic media strategist based in New York City and partner at Slingshot Strategies. She served as an adviser to top elected officials, candidates, and causes at the national, state, and local levels. Welcome to the show, Alyssa. Alyssa Cass: Hi. It is so good to be here. AL: We’re speaking on Wednesday, October 22nd. [Editor’s note: On October 24, Politico reported that Rep. Hakeem Jeffries will be endorsing Zohran Mamdani.] And just a note, we are not endorsing any candidate on this podcast, and we’re focusing on the pressures building both locally and nationally on the Democratic party. To start, especially for our listeners outside of New York, why has Mamdani’s campaign become a national story? You have Fox News running wall-to-wall coverage, Trump calling to deport him — what exactly is bringing so much national attention to this race? Chi, we’ll start with you. CO: Absolutely. Well, first and foremost, I believe that it’s one of the biggest races that we’re seeing post-November of 2024. And after Republicans secured levels within Congress as well as the presidency, people are looking at the Democratic Party and seeing how we respond to that especially within the New York City mayoral race. You know, we could have gone two ways. We could have gone back to or continued this trend of electing centrist, moderate Democrats — or we could have gone with Zohran Mamdani, someone who ran as a loud and proud democratic socialist who has always fought on the left, who speaks up about Palestinian rights and sovereignty. And this race showed that the party is accepting and willing to move to the left. Zohran ran a very creative, loud race that was centered around affordability and did so without being tied to the financial institutions and entities that usually elect our mayors here within New York City. And made a lot of noise during the campaign, galvanized a lot of people, and made some history in terms of how the campaign was run. So with all of that, it made this a historic race, one that has caught the ears of many and has skyrocketed Zohran into the place where he is today. AL: Alyssa, I want to bring you in. I mean, you worked on the 2021 mayoral race, you’ve worked on national races. What’s your perspective on what is making this resonate with people outside of New York or have the potential ramifications that go beyond the city? AC: I think about that question in kind of two primary buckets. The first is, why is this so interesting? One is, I think that it offers us a view of politics and the contours of politics that’s actually more realistic or how actual people think about it. Traditionally, we’ve thought about politics as left, right, and center. And I think that the major fault line in politics now, or how people think about it, is that the status quo is not working for almost anyone. “He fundamentally reconstituted the electorate. … He was able to put together a coalition of, frankly, almost everyone, just other than the very wealthy.” And if we don’t reform the status quo, we are going to break it. And Zohran offered a message that was less about ideology and more about disrupting a failed status quo that is working for almost no one. And that approach to the race offers Democrats a really powerful path forward. And as we think about how do we reconstitute winning coalitions — and that’s something I think has been a little under appreciated about Zohran’s win — he fundamentally reconstituted the electorate. If you live in New York City — if you are working class, middle class, or even upper middle class — New York City is not working for you. If you are anyone who interacts with public services on a daily basis, if you’re sending your kid to public school, if you’re taking the bus, if you’re riding the subway, New York City life is really like — hard. AL: You can say the f-word, it’s OK. AC: It’s really fucking hard. And he was able to put together a coalition of, frankly, almost everyone, just other than the very wealthy. And frankly offer an optimistic view of politics that brought us together about what unites us: that no one’s having an easy time. Obviously there are different degrees to that, but these parallel crises of affordability for almost every American tapping into that is the path forward for anyone who wants to win. And I think that those two reasons: of one, seeing the electorate not in these ideological terms that I think mostly people like us think about, but normal people don’t, and the ability to rebuild a democratic coalition, is exactly what people are talking about, and it’s not done through, like, big focus groups about what men are thinking or what words we’re saying, but how to build a coalition of people for whom the status quo isn’t working, which is almost everyone. AL: We’re speaking on the morning after a shocking immigration raid in Manhattan’s Chinatown where federal agents arrested multiple people. New York has sanctuary city laws that forbid cops and other local officials from coordinating with federal immigration enforcement. And as of this recording, Mayor Eric Adams and the NYPD say the city had nothing to do with the raid. Both Cuomo and Mamdani have put out statements condemning the raid. But more specifically in a moment like this, how should a New York City mayor respond? Chi, start with you. CO: Absolutely. Well, I don’t believe a word that comes out of Eric Adams’s mouth. And he is an accomplice if not a lapdog to Donald Trump. So in terms of the statements that were shared, I do not believe him. A mayor, and hopefully the next mayor, will uphold our sanctuary laws and also work with the NYPD and use his authority to make sure that all people who live here in New York City are protected regardless of their immigration status when it comes to federal agents infringing on the rights of the land here in New York. AC: Yeah, I think something we saw last night, but we’ve seen kind of throughout the past few months, are reminders of, is that Donald Trump is coming for New York City regardless. And what New Yorkers want is not someone who is promising to work with Trump, or can manage Trump, or who has a history of negotiating with Trump. That we’re actually seeing that like that doesn’t matter. “What New Yorkers want is not someone who is promising to work with Trump, or can manage Trump, or who has a history of negotiating with Trump.” We really need someone who is principled, incredibly disciplined in saying, “Donald Trump, hands off New York.” And we’ve actually seen this dynamic, I think, play out in a really interesting way throughout this general election. I think that you saw, at the end of the primary, you saw Cuomo beginning to try to socialize with New Yorkers. “If Donald Trump’s coming after New York, you want someone who can give him a call and talk him down.” We’re seeing that like that’s not possible, was never possible. There was so much coverage about New York City’s shift to the right, the increase in New York City voters who voted for Trump. They were voting for Trump, I think what we’re seeing now is not because they wanted ICE raids that destroy communities, destroy our economies, and rip our New York City neighbors from their schools and their homes — they wanted someone who was listening. So the best way to actually fight Trump and to rebuild a Democratic Party is not through compromise, but really through a pursuit of our principles and our values. AL: And I want to draw this out to the national level too, because this is extremely parallel with the criticisms, you know, facing national Democrats — Chuck Schumer, et cetera, Hakeem Jeffries in Congress — and this idea that at the beginning of Trump’s term, national Democrats really were sitting back and saying, “Is there a world in which we can play nice with Trump and have some leverage, some negotiating, leverage some power? Something to bring to the table.” And it quickly became obvious that that wasn’t going to work. But also that was extremely infuriating to voters. And I think that’s why you’re seeing Democrats pivot with this shutdown strategy. Whereas back in March, they were saying, let’s try to work with Republicans where we can. But I think what you’re saying, Alyssa, is that that is not something that voters have the patience for anymore. And I think that’s not just a New York City thing, that’s a national thing. AC: Yeah. I think part of why Donald Trump won or why you’ve seen Democrats struggle is that when the status quo isn’t working, bad ideas beat no ideas. And we’ve often been the party and had candidates that are “no ideas.” And what we are seeing is that Democrats can win when we have ideas. Zohran is a case study of that. So when trying to manage or handle Trump, the idea isn’t to go along or get along. That’s a “no idea.” “When the status quo isn’t working, bad ideas beat no ideas. … What we are seeing is that Democrats can win when we have ideas. Zohran is a case study of that.” We need new ideas and preparedness. I think one of the biggest tasks of the future mayor is getting prepared for an escalation in the assault on New York City. We know he’s coming. I think we have every reason to expect National Guard or federal troops and making sure we’re prepared, right? Making sure we are setting the rules of the road with NYPD and other agencies and cooperating with that sort of incursion. And that will be like day one after the general election, the real work of the mayor-elect. AL: Chi, do you want to add anything on the tail end of that? CO: I absolutely agree with Alyssa’s point. I also do want to note that on the topic of national Democrats and them wanting to work with Trump and at least see if there’s a middle ground — Trump doesn’t give a fuck, right? And his whole modem operandi is to embarrass Democrats and has been doing so both with Chuck and Hakeem. In addition to that, our leadership in the Democratic Party somewhat ushered this type of behavior in. Back when Mahmoud Khalil was disappeared right here in the city, both of those individuals were very quiet, if not timid, on making statements and being very loud about their statements in the disappearing of people and disappearing of Mahmoud Khalil. They kind of set the precedent for this to happen, especially here in this city. So to have a mayor-elect and future mayor who’s going to speak truth to power and stand on business when it comes to how evil ICE is, right? And call-out how un-American and Gestapo-like that ICE is, is going to be something that I believe will resound with New Yorkers. And that New Yorkers want to see their elected officials, their mayor, their Democrats fighting for, right? AL: So jumping back in time a little bit, shortly after the primary, there was a ton of reporting on how New York’s wealthiest business leaders were working to defeat Mamdani, including offering to help Adams find a private sector job if he dropped out. One of the city’s biggest real estate developers was floated as an option at one point. But last week, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said he would support Mamdani if he won. What’s your reaction to that? If Mamdani wins, Alyssa, what sorts of roadblocks can he expect from the city’s elite? AC: Mamdani’s done a lot of work to assuage and do a charm campaign with the business community. AL: Right. AC: Not because he’s going to betray his agenda, but because it’s a savvy observation that they’re actually pretty easy to pacify, right? And is avoiding, I think, some of the missteps that Bill de Blasio did. Bill de Blasio got pretty beat up immediately by the business community. But the business community is actually easy to charm, right? The thing that they care about the most, that most materially impacts them — like, let’s say raising taxes — a mayor of New York City actually doesn’t have much, doesn’t have any control over. So when it comes to the business community, I think that a little bit of engaging, showing that you’ll pick up their calls — which Bill de Blasio was unwilling to do — goes a long way. And that ultimately, the mayor of New York City is not materially impacting these people who are really out for themselves. And that actually creates an environment where [it’s] easy to give them a little face-time and then I think they shut up. AL: To your point, you said he’s meeting with these people not because he is going to betray his agenda, but that is what some people are concerned about. AC: I think you want to like — Listen, being mayor is really fucking hard, and you have a very limited runway before everyone is going to start shitting on you and be very critical. And it’s hard to implement your agenda. Clearing the decks from a chorus of haters or trying to lessen them a bit is not kowtowing. It’s just paving the way for an easier time, because there are going to be actual crises to deal with. So I think it’s clearing a smoother runway for when you’re actually sworn in. And there’s so much out of your control — like there could be a snowstorm that becomes a disaster — that you want to clear the decks, shut up the haters by dishing out a little sugar. That’s savvy, not being compromised. AL: I want to put this to both of you. How can we expect those same people to react to a Cuomo win? Chi, we’ll start with you. CO: The business people? AL: Yeah. And you know, the elite of of New York, the people who, you know, originally were partnering with Bill Ackman to try to figure out how to— CO: Yeah. I mean, I think they want Cuomo to win, obviously. I do believe that a majority of the elite want Cuomo to win. I think it’s more about what Zohran means for politics, right? He was able to win without the backing and being tethered again to these financial institutions. And many of these elite folks want elected officials that they can control. And if someone can win as mayor of New York City without being tethered to their power, what could that mean for city council, state Assembly, state Senate, and even some of our congressional seats? “If someone can win as mayor of New York City without being tethered to their power, what could that mean for city council, state Assembly, state Senate, and even some of our congressional seats?” AC: Yeah. And like, here’s my thing through all of this, when Bill Ackman throws a temper tantrum, or John Catsimatidis, which I think that’s the right pronunciation, throws a temper tantrum, I think people see that and it moves people toward Zohran. Like, wasn’t the whole point of Zohran’s election is that people are sick and tired of people like Bill Ackman paying little in taxes and having a massive apartment and having the influence that they do, right? Like that status quo that these people are screaming about that Zohran is going to disrupt is the very thing people don’t like. So yeah, I’m sure they’re going to have a meltdown. And they are welcome to move to Boca, and we will be thrilled to convert their brownstones and mega penthouses into multifamily dwellings to further make a dent in our housing crisis. AL: Going back to Cuomo. I know that some members, some city council members, were stripped from their roles in budget negotiations after backing Cuomo. Chi, what is the mood toward Cuomo among city councilors right now? CO: There’s a higher definite chance that Zohran becomes the next mayor, and regardless of where people fall within that politically ideological spectrum, I think people do want to be on good terms with the mayor, right? So I do think that there has been a vast distancing from Andrew Cuomo. AC: And the councilman makes a great point. And I think that is revealing of a bigger dynamic that I think is worth pointing out. People who are really watching New York politics are like, this is not like a real race, right? It is being treated as a very competitive general election for reasons that are divorced from the mechanics and the central dynamics of the race. Zohran had a winning message and a winning coalition, and Andrew Cuomo did not. None of those dynamics have changed. And you see the rest of the political class in New York very much understanding that. And we are thrilled for the attention and continue to go along with the ruse that Andrew Cuomo would like us to believe that this is still a competitive election and that he somehow has a path, but he does not. “We are thrilled for the attention and continue to go along with the ruse that Andrew Cuomo would like us to believe that this is still a competitive election and that he somehow has a path, but he does not.” AL: So far, only five Democrats representing New York City in Congress have endorsed Mamdani, the party’s nominee: Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Nydia Velázquez, who both endorsed him before he won the primary; Adriano Espaillat, Jerry Nadler, and Yvette Clarke, who endorsed him after he won. Gov. Kathy Hochul and Attorney General Letitia James got on board. Notably absent are Democrats’ top two leaders in Congress — Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, both of whom have addressed this in the last week or so and said they are still planning to weigh in. [Editor’s note: On October 24, Politico reported that Rep. Hakeem Jeffries will be endorsing Zohran Mamdani.] Many other Democrats have backed Cuomo, others whose candidates lost in the primary haven’t endorsed anyone else. What’s happening here? Are there two Democratic Parties? AC: So what is happening here is that the leaders, the elected leaders of the Democratic Party look so fucking stupid, I’m sorry. Honestly, it would’ve been better for them to just like, never endorse him and say like, “I’m just not going to make an endorsement in this race. I didn’t in the primary,” and like, move the fuck on. This is really the worst of both worlds. And just the message it sends. You hear from both of those leaders that we are a big-tent party, but apparently not so big if you have certain concerns about certain issues. The biggest discomfort with Zohran seems to be around foreign policy issues that have nothing to do with fucking New York City and also are so out of the mainstream of where the median Democratic voter is in New York City or beyond, it further reveals that there is a gap between the people who are calling all of the shots and regular voters. It only serves to put them, to make them seem more out of touch and more beholden not to rank-and-file Democrats but something else. AL: Chi, do you want to add anything? CO: Sure, yeah. Their donors won’t let them. AL: Who? Which donors? Who are we talking about? CO: All of them. AL: Can you say more? CO: Yeah. Probably BlackRock, the largest landlord in this country, probably AIPAC. Yeah, I think those donors will not let them endorse Zohran Mamdani for mayor. AC: Those sorts of donors give way more money at this point to the Republican Party and to Republican elected officials. Like, we are getting very little out of this. It shows a very — a view of politics and where to get money that is really out of date. CO: Yeah. It’s the same donors that don’t let them fight against Donald Trump, right? AL: Alyssa, you brought up the foreign policy thing, and Chi, you’re mentioning AIPAC too. Mamdani has also faced criticism from his left and much on his right, particularly on this Israel–Gaza issue. Last week, he was asked during the mayoral debate about the ongoing saga around this phrase Mamdani himself has never used — “globalize the intifada” — but which many Democrats and pro-Israel critics have urged him to denounce. This is a phrase that many pro-Palestine advocates say simply calls for the end of the Israeli occupation – “intifada” is an Arabic word meaning uprising or resistance. But many pro-Israel Mamdani critics have turned it into a political cudgel to spread this fear that Mamdani won’t keep Jewish New Yorkers safe. I wrote about this last week, and you can find the story at The Intercept. Mamdani has drawn criticism for similar comments, including that he threw the movement for Palestine under the bus or that he’s a Zionist. Is there a “right” way for Dems to play this? Chi, I’ll start with you. CO: I don’t necessarily see it as a right way for Democrats to play this. I think Mamdani has 38 percent of support from the Jewish vote to Andrew Cuomo’s 42 percent. That’s basically equally matched. I believe for this issue, this is something that Jewish voters are definitely taking a look at, and a sizable amount support Mamdani and his efforts. AL: Alyssa, is there a right way for Democrats to play this issue? AC: So it seems to me that his approach of not ever endorsing or supporting the flattening of Gaza was the right approach. This is an issue where you will never please everyone, but the majority of Jewish Democratic voters believe there there’s a genocide that’s been happening in the Middle East. AL: Right. “What is popular and what is morally righteous are the same position right now.” AC: Are uncomfortable with the current no-strings-attached relationship with a radical right-wing Israeli government. And to me, when you’re looking at where’s the right place to be, I’m not sure it’s that hard. Because what is popular and what is morally righteous are the same position right now. AL: I’m going to switch gears a little bit and go back to early this year, January, February. It’s cold out. The mayoral race is just beginning. Everyone’s wondering if Eric Adams will even run again because he’s still under indictment. There are whispers about Cuomo, the assumption is that if he does jump in, everyone else might as well pack it up and go home. Why was he considered such a shoe-in? CO: Cuomo did a really good job at creating this paper tiger effect on the political establishment. And it was very unclear as to what was going to happen within this mayoral race, especially with the amount of candidates that were jumping in and was able to secure some union endorsements from the get-go. There is this notion within our prior understanding of the New York City electorate, that a lot of voters who turn out in these elections — usual voters who turn out in these elections — will vote for the name that they know. And, you know, Andrew Cuomo was a name for older Black voters and Latino voters and outer borough voters, which was a strategy that Eric Adams used to win in 2021. So it created this effect that really galvanized a lot of the New York City press corp as well, right, political press corp to aid in Cuomo’s efforts of making him seem as unstoppable as he appeared. What was not taken into account was — and frankly could not be taken into account — was the movement that Zohran and New York City DSA were able to put together. It energized thousands, tens of thousands of new voters, folks who usually don’t come out and vote in New York City mayoral races. AC: Actually, when I look back, Zohran ran the most big-D Democratic campaign of any of the candidates in the primary. While many of us political consultants had our heads up our own asses, myself included, feeling very fearful, seeing the red wave that had happened in New York City and thinking — We forgot that this is a deeply Democratic town, and a liberal or progressive one at that. “We forgot that this is a deeply Democratic town, and a liberal or progressive one at that.” While the rest of the field was modulating on public safety or bringing in a more moderate tone to everything those campaigns were doing, Zohran ran a proud Democratic campaign, about making this city work for New Yorkers that was definitely democratic and the best sense of what being a classic Democrat was. And also understood — like they did something so well, but it was a very basic premise — that talking all of the time about the thing that people are thinking about and are keeping [them] up at night and are telling people is their number one concern is smart. The basic concept was not rocket science. And everyone else overcomplicating shit, created a real pathway for an insurgent candidate like Mamdani. AL: Thank you Council Member Chi Ossé and Democratic strategist Alyssa Cass, we really appreciate you joining us on the Intercept Briefing. CO: Thank you so much for having us. AC: Thank you. Original reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept? By signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use. [Break] AL: We’re continuing the conversation about how the New York City mayoral race is shaping the future of the Democratic Party with Attorney Jim Walden. He’s endorsing Andrew Cuomo. Walden was running his own independent bid until early September, when he dropped out. His name will still be on the ballot in November — but he says he doesn’t want it there. Jim, welcome to The Intercept Briefing. Jim Walden: Thank you Akela. Thanks for having me. AL: We’re speaking to Jim on Thursday morning So we have been talking about the future of the Democratic Party. There’s been a lot of discussion in this past year since Kamala Harris lost the presidential election about a desire for a fresh start in the party. How does Cuomo fit into that future? JW: To the extent that the future of the Democratic [Party] as there’s a socialist future in there, I don’t think that Andrew Cuomo would ever be pushed that far. At the end of the day, he is a free market guy. He believes in the private sector. He believes that it’s critical for building, which is so important to the future of New York City. And so I think that it’ll be super interesting from the perspective of someone who’s been a long time independent to see across the country and in particular in New York, where the party goes. My guess is that there’s going to be a flirtation with socialism and maybe some populist push but that ultimately the party will come back closer to the center. AL: What are the policies that he’s running on right now that you see as emblematic of his potential to step into this leadership role at a critical moment in Democratic politics? JW: Housing in New York City, I can’t stress this enough, is central to solving the affordability crisis. And just today there was a number of press reports that came out that talked about the fact that the market for rent-stabilized housing, which represents about a million units across the city, that landlords are in financial distress and 1 in 5 buildings is underwater and they’re delaying things like repairs. And that is having a very, very significant impact on particularly Black and brown tenants who make up a significant portion of the rent-stabilized portfolio. “Andrew Cuomo is someone that has very close relationships with developers. He’s taken a lot of flack for that.” So Andrew Cuomo is someone that has very close relationships with developers. He’s taken a lot of flack for that. But you know, when you have a fire, you’re calling firefighters. When you have a criminal running down the street, you call the cops. We have a housing crisis that if we can’t solve it, it’s going to have collateral consequences across our economy. AL: So when you were running for mayor, you pitched yourself as the business community candidate, a reasonable moderate who knows how to work with the city’s elites and navigate the complexities of city government. And also as an outsider, who was someone who wasn’t a technocrat, someone who could appeal to some of the frustrations I think that people have had with the Democratic Party. What do you say to critics who might argue that the city’s billionaires are the people who most want Cuomo to win, and that this is a strategy to maintain the status quo? JW: That is an incredibly important question. And let me just double down in a show of self-awareness. I’ve said quite clearly that Andrew Cuomo getting into the race was one of the reasons that I decided to run because I thought that we needed change and we needed new leadership. So I’m not running away from any of my prior positions. Unfortunately, we have the candidates that we have, and I’ve said as clearly as I can that I think that they are all challenged candidates for different reasons, whether it’s experience, whether or not prior scandals and the like, but it was an uncomfortable choice that I had to make. But I made that choice, Akela, a long time ago. But it is actually really surprising to me that [Mamdani] has taken off the way that he has. And as I saw him ascend, I was actually one of the first people that predicted— I had run a whole Monte Carlo simulation before the Democratic primary in four of the 10 simulations, Mamdani won, and those were predictably accurate. And as I saw him rise, I saw him in some ways embrace more what I think are, you know, dangerous and radical policies. “They are all challenged candidates for different reasons, whether it’s experience, whether or not prior scandals and the like, but it was an uncomfortable choice that I had to make.” Akela Lacy: Yeah. So I want to go back to this idea of the status quo because — and I hear what you’re saying about your calculation both in jumping into the race and then removing yourself from the race because of the writing that you saw on the wall. But do you see Cuomo as a potential extension of that status quo? And if not, can you explain why not? Jim Walden: Status quo is, maybe we can sharpen that a little by saying that he’s an institutionalist, right? So I believe that it’s fair to say that, I’ll speak about me. I’m an institutionalist in the sense that for 23 years I’ve been bringing pro bono cases attacking city, state, and federal government for a lot of bad things that they’ve done to people. That doesn’t mean that I don’t support the institutions of democracy and our government. I do. And I believe that Andrew Cuomo is very much of the same ilk, although he may be more of an institutionalist because he’s been part of the governing elite, if you will. But at the same time I think that he will talk about changing the status quo, I think he’s going to change the status to quote completely when it comes to housing. I know for sure that his plan is — and again, to be clear, I’m not in the Cuomo campaign. I did this as a matter of my own personal politics and my own belief in what was the best for the city. I know that he’s going to do everything he could possibly do to start building things right away. And that’s what we need. I mean, if you think about the most recent data on housing, right? 2024 is the most complete picture that we have. Mayor Adams, to his credit, oversaw the building of about 25,000 rent-stabilized apartments. That’s great. That’s that’s a big bump from where we’ve been. The problem is that we lost 11,000 of older units that were being warehoused. And so 25,000 come on, 11,000 go off. We need somewhere between, depending on whose estimate you look at — My best estimate was 50,000 rent-stabilized units a year. Zohran Mamdani plan is only going to build 20,000 rent-stabilized apartments a year if it works. That’s something where I do trust Cuomo. AL: We have some breaking news as we’re speaking. New York City Mayor Eric Adams is endorsing Cuomo for mayor after joining him courtside at the Knicks game on Wednesday night. Can we get your reaction to that, Jim? JW: Yeah. So Adams endorsing Cuomo is really no surprise. You know, this kind of is a testament to again, all of the ways in which our political system is broken and in some ways dysfunctional. Eric Adams, whatever it was a month ago, said that Andrew Cuomo was a snake and a liar, and then they’re sitting at the Knicks game together, and then there’s an endorsement the next day. You know, I think that those sorts of things turn off people. They turn off voters. How can you have a positive reaction to that? “Those sorts of things turn off people. They turn off voters. How can you have a positive reaction to that?” But at the same time politics is politics, and at the end of the day it comes down to numbers. And with Cuomo and Sliwa in the race, Mamdani’s got a huge advantage. Just the math is the math. I mean, I’ve said this a million times and I don’t know how many people are listening to me on it. AL: You mentioned Adam doing this turn toward Cuomo after calling him a snake, but you had similar words for Cuomo in May. You described him as “a tired snake oil salesman, who’s on his last leg.” What is it about his policies that have made you change your mind? JW: So Cuomo while, I have deep, deep disagreements with him on a number of the things that have happened during the course of his career. He is a person that we need right now. Why? If you look at any projection — it doesn’t matter whether it’s inside the government or outside the government, unless some amazing, wonderful thing happens to the city — the minimum deficit that we’re going to have next year is $5 billion. And some of the estimates go up to something like nine, just next year. In the two years after that — again, unless there’s some sort of magic ointment that someone applies to our business community — the deficits are going to get much higher. And in that environment when we need so much, and we are already in a distressed situation with tax revenue, there’s going to have to be bold moves that pay the bills for all the things that we need to do. And Zohran Mamdani, he has said more times than I can count that he wants to dismantle or defund the police. And then he’s running on a platform that he says “I’m not trying to defund the police,” but he is trying to defund the police. And this is one of the things that’s so frustrating to see low-information voters bite on this hook. Which is, he’s saying he’s going to keep the current level of police the same. We are down — depending on whose estimate you want to look at — the range is somewhere between 5,000 and 8,000 cops. No one’s really looking at the rate at which senior officers and detectives are filing for early retirement. “ We need more cops. And he’s not being honest about the fact that he really is defunding the police by holding the current headcount.” And there hasn’t been an enormous push to recruit. I think that at the end of the day, at the end of the year, if we end up flat, I think we’ll be lucky. But we need more cops. And he’s not being honest about the fact that he really is defunding the police by holding the current headcount. And earlier when he was describing his community, his department of community safety, I was standing next to him at a full mayoral forum where he said he was going to fund that by taking $1 billion out of the NYPD overtime budget. I was standing right there. And then when he put the PRO plan out, maybe after getting some initial criticism and feedback, he claims that he’s going to pay for it by raising taxes, both corporate and individual. So I believe that he wants to defund the police, and I believe everything that he’s been saying for years about his perspective on NYPD, you know, he said he was going to apologize. He then pivoted and said, well, I’m going to do it privately with individual officers. I’m not going to issue a blanket apology. You know, I have a lot of cops who are friends and I can’t tell you the number of times, Akela, that cops have said to me, “Listen, if he’s going to be mayor and he’s going to change the CCRB, so the police commissioner has no power over choosing discipline for officers, I’m out of here.” So and those are two of the key reasons that cops are leaving the city is because the CCRB, it always was a broken agency. I had planned to get rid of it with something that was much more effective in terms of getting at the bad apples in NYPD and not victimizing cops that were trying to do their jobs and got into bad situations that they tried their best to control, but still had a complaint filed against them. So the CCRB, the extent to which they’re now being forced into overtime shifts that are akin to a indentured servitude at times, and lower starting salaries than is being competitive with other states outside of New York. That’s why we’re losing active-duty officers because it’s like, I don’t need this anymore. So that’s one example of a policy that I think is dangerous. AL: There’s more that I can talk about but we’re getting close to time. So, Jim Walden, thank you so much for joining us on the Intercept Briefing. Really appreciate your time.

What we’re seeing right now from Donald Trump is a full-on authoritarian takeover of the U.S. government. This is not hyperbole. Court orders are being ignored. MAGA loyalists have been put in charge of the military and federal law enforcement agencies. The Department of Government Efficiency has stripped Congress of its power of the purse. News outlets that challenge Trump have been banished or put under investigation. Yet far too many are still covering Trump’s assault on democracy like politics as usual, with flattering headlines describing Trump as “unconventional,” “testing the boundaries,” and “aggressively flexing power.” The Intercept has long covered authoritarian governments, billionaire oligarchs, and backsliding democracies around the world. We understand the challenge we face in Trump and the vital importance of press freedom in defending democracy.

Title: Judgment against three ‘dodgy box’ operators who may have to pay hundreds of thousands to Sky

Three people involved in selling “dodgy boxes” – which are used to illegally access TV streaming services – have been found liable by the High Court to pay possibly hundreds of thousands of euro which Sky says it has lost from their activities. Mr Justice Liam Kennedy granted judgment, in two separate cases, against the three to Sky UK Ltd which provides TV services in the UK and Ireland. The three, who failed to appear in court, are Andrew Keena of Mariner’s Court, Blackrock, Co Louth, and Stephen McBride and Carol Thornton, both of Defenders Row, Dundalk, Co Louth. The judge also granted permanent injunctions that they cease all copyright-infringing activities and not to continue to make the material available on their infringing services. They are also prohibited from taking, directly or indirectly, steps to transfer or give away any source code or other technology related to their infringing services and to cease all advertising of the services. The court will assess damages at a future date. An investigator employed by Sky Subscriber Services Ltd said in affidavits that the estimated annual loss from Mr Keena’s activities was conservatively put at €643,860 based on Sky’s average revenue per month of €73 per customer. Mr Keena is estimated to have had 735 customers paying an entity called “Interstellar Media” €95 per year, bringing in €69,825. The number of customers was based on members of a Facebook group set up for the purpose of providing information about the use of Interstellar Media. However, the investigator said in one Facebook post, in June 2021 during the UEFA Euro football tournament, it was stated there were “over 4,856 customers”. Interstellar Media was notable among infringers in that it used its own branded application to provide its services via downloads for internet protocol TV (IPTV) firesticks, computers and other devices, the investigator said. Most IPTV service providers use generic applications to stream their services. [ Confessions of a dodgy box owner: ‘It did give me pause for thought but the savings are incredible’Opens in new window ] Mr McBride and Ms Thornton charged a “competitive” €70 per year for their service, the investigator said. Infringing IPTV subscriptions regularly sell for €100 plus per year, he added. In the McBride/Thornton case, the investigator estimated an annual loss to Sky of €876,000. Mr McBride boasted of selling to more than 1,000, which meant a revenue for them of more than €70,000. The McBride/Thornton service involved customers downloading an application called “Dreambox Android XMBC” to an Amazon Firestick which provided Sky Entertainment, Sky Sports and Sky Cinema, among other channels. Mr McBride also sent an instructional video to customers on how to install and use the service. All three defendants advertised through Facebook while the McBride/Thornton service was also on Instagram using slogans like “Sick of paying ridiculous Sky bills” and “No more stupid Sky bills”. When “cease and desist” letters were sent by Sky’s lawyers to all three, Mr Keena said Interstellar Media was no longer in operation since around November 2021. He also claimed that his PayPal account, which received payments for Interstellar Media, had been used without his knowledge by a third party. He refused to name the third party. The investigator said Mr Keena also has an apparent connection with another infringing IPTV service called Showbiz Media and this means his infringing activities are not just limited to Interstellar Media. Interstellar was a very sophisticated service operating at scale and Mr Keena had been “very evasive and dishonest in his limited engagements” with Sky, he said. When Mr McBride received a cease and desist letter, he replied in April 2022 saying “Excuse me?. Is this spam or a joke?” The investigator said, at his request, Mr McBride’s Facebook profile was removed. But he created two new profiles, one in his own name and other called “Firesticks Dundalk”. [ The Irish Times view on dodgy boxes: enforce the lawOpens in new window ] In and around mid-2023, when Sky first commence legal proceedings against him and Ms Thornton, the infringing services ceased. The defendants, who have not otherwise engaged with the proceedings against them, will have an opportunity to turn up in court when the assessment of damages is being carried out.

Title: Trump Wrecks America. His “Patriotic” Fans Cheer. Is There Any Bottom?

Time Published: 2025-10-24T14:40:04Z

I was going to write one more liberal column expressing outrage about what Donald Trump has done to the White House this week, but then I thought: Why? What would be the point? The people who would agree with me would agree with me, and the people who wouldn’t wouldn’t, and the world would go on its merry way. Of course the president’s destruction of the East Wing is beyond outrageous. It’s completely illegal and un-American—not just un-American, but anti-American: the unilateral, I-don’t-give-a-fuck desecration of a civic shrine that belonged to all the people. Democracies have appointed bodies that oversee such things. Dictators, actual and aspiring, ignore all that. Call it overreaction if you must, but I’m sure I’m hardly the only American to google “Albert Speer Germania” this week. And yet, it’s probably only the third-most-outrageous thing Trump has done since Monday. To place, in horse-racing parlance, I’d put the pardon of Changpeng Zhao, who “invested” in the Trump family’s World Liberty Financial cryptocurrency start-up and who pleaded guilty in 2023 to allowing his Binance crypto exchange to be used—get this now, and imagine a Democrat issuing a pardon to such a person—by, among other unsavories, Hamas’s military wing (not just plain old Hamas—its military wing!). And taking the gold medal this week would be the $230 million extortion that the sitting president of the United States demanded from the Department of Justice. (I cannot believe I just wrote that sentence.) A Pahlavi-level tacky ballroom can always be torn down; these other corrupt precedents cannot be undone. No—one more outraged liberal column won’t add much this week. The more interesting thing I’ve been thinking about lately is not the leader who perpetrates these acts but the people who allow them and cheer them. Because this is the truly maddening question, from a small-d democratic perspective. Authoritarian-fascist demagogues come along sometimes; that’s the world. But democratic societies stop them. Why hasn’t ours stopped Trump? We are cursed with four categories of fascism enablers. The interesting question about each group is not merely what they are doing, but why: What motivates them? Let’s go through them. First, obviously, are the Republicans in Congress and on the Supreme Court. Call them 1a and 1b, because I believe they have different motivations. The Republicans in the House and the Senate are mostly just tiny cowards who fear Trump, a possible primary challenger from the right, and most of all the MAGA base. The video clips that I hope they play over and over in future high school civics classes, assuming these thugs can’t fully erase our democracy, will be the ones of GOP legislators scurrying for the elevators as they deny having knowledge of Trump’s latest assault. Against stern competition, House Speaker Mike Johnson, the tiniest coward of them all, is the most pathetic exemplar of this: “I’m not gonna comment on something I haven’t read, so I’m not sure what you’re talking about,” he told reporters this week when they asked him about the DOJ bribe. The six conservatives on the Supreme Court, in contrast, aren’t cowards. They know what they’re doing, and they have no voters to fear. We must assume that they are consciously creating the America they want. That’s most true of the two deepest reactionaries, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito. But to varying degrees, it’s true of the other four conservatives, John Roberts very much included. The record they are leaving behind of these terse, barely explained pro-Trump shadow docket decisions will be their legacy—of shame, if we manage to restore democracy after Trump, or of glory, if we descend into a Hunger Games society. Group two consists of the cowards in the corporate and business worlds who surely know on some level that Trump is dangerous. But they stay silent, for, I think, one of two reasons, or some combination thereof. One, they fear Trumpian retribution. Two, they want their taxes cut. Have a gander at this list of donors to Trump’s razing of the East Wing for his ballroom. Talk about a basket of deplorables. Stephen Schwarzman of Blackstone. The Fanjul brothers, the megarich sugar magnates and welfare queens. Meta (Mark Zuckerberg). Amazon (Jeff Bezos). Palantir (Peter Thiel). Others are less blatantly offensive but obviously covering their corporate behinds. These are not by and large stupid people. On some level, they see what Trump is doing to this country. They just care more about other things. Third come the right-wing “media” outlets that serve as Trump’s propaganda arms. Among this group again I think we see dual motivations. The first is the kind of cynicism exposed in those publicly released Fox News depositions relating to the Dominion Voting Systems lawsuit: Trump is good for business, so they lie for him to make money. The second motivation is more genuine: They truly despise liberals and liberalism and think we must be stopped at all costs, even when it involves lying to their audiences for a higher purpose. This mixture of the insincere and the sincere may seem incongruous, but actually the two motivations mesh together perfectly: The insincerity ensures that they defend and minimize every single thing Trump does, while the sincerity drives their coverage of Democrats and liberals, although it too is salted with plenty of cynicism, as when they try to persuade their viewers that some kooky neo-Marxist tenured postmodernist professor stands in for American liberalism. And finally—the MAGA faithful. Here let’s distinguish between the soft Trump supporters and the true red-hots. Of the 40 or 42 percent of Americans who still say they approve of Trump’s job performance, I’m guessing that a third or so are soft supporters. Some are swing voters. Some are evangelicals for whom a Democratic vote is basically out of the question. Some remember the first Trump economy fondly. There are lots of different motivations there, but what they have in common is that they don’t necessarily consider him America’s savior. But that other two-thirds … I hesitate to say these are bad human beings. But their rage at certain developments in the United States over these last 30-odd years is so overpowering that their civic and small-d democratic instincts have been buried by the antagonisms Trump has brought to the surface of American politics. They once knew, or they know, or a part of them knows, that no actual leader should be calling human beings “vermin.” But that empathic impulse isn’t much match for rage, which can be quite exhilarating and liberating (we all must admit that we know this feeling from personal experience). How deep does that rage run? We don’t yet know. We have yet to see its bottom. Tearing down part of the White House may lose him a portion of the softs, as polls suggest. But it won’t bother the red-hots, who’ll leap to point out, as I saw some nincompoop do on Newsmax Thursday night, that what Trump did was really no different from Barack Obama ordering the building of his basketball court. The pardon of Zhao is in fact the liberation of the crypto industry from the shackles imposed by Sleepy Joe. The DOJ bribe is money due to Trump fair and square. And so on and so on. I sometimes wonder what it will take for some of these folks to peel away. What if ICE agents just start shooting people? They already are; but I mean en masse. I doubt even that will change anything. Things will change when the rage stops being exhilarating, and I doubt that happens anytime soon. It takes all four of these groups to sustain Trumpism. If Republicans in Congress were doing their constitutional job, Trump would still be Trump but the legislative branch would have established the reality of limits. The corporate class could have said to him: We too know that we thrive best under democratic norms, and we cannot tolerate you breaking those. The right-wing media could still be basically pro-Trump while adhering more closely to the principles of conservatism than to genuflection before one man. And finally, his base too could at least from time to time acknowledge error on his part and demand that he adjust course. But none of these things are happening. And it’s hard to see them happening anytime soon. Bad as this week was, it’s not close to the bottom we’re going to hit. If you’ve heard any Republicans talk about Saturday’s No Kings marches across the country, you know what they’re calling them. House Speaker Mike Johnson on Wednesday referred to the marches collectively as a “hate America rally.” He continued: “Let’s see who shows up for that. I bet you see pro-Hamas supporters. I bet you see antifa types. I bet you see the Marxists in full display.” Many others on the right have echoed these sentiments over and over, and Fox News and the other state propaganda outlets have followed suit, thus washing the brains of their viewers into accepting, once again, the exact opposite of reality. You will probably find the occasional Marxist or antifa type or even the odd Hamas enthusiast marching somewhere tomorrow, because this is still a free country, and people aren’t asked a series of litmus-test questions before they’re allowed to join the fray. But overwhelmingly, these are marches of mainstream Americans. These are marches of teachers, lawyers, laborers, service workers, accountants, nurses, Pilates instructors, bank tellers—everyone. These are marches of people who love their country and are horrified at what President Donald Trump and the Republicans are doing to it. These are marches of patriots. The real, actual, thoughtful, quiet, modest, non-flag-hugging patriots (because history teaches us over and over that the people who need to make a show of hugging the flag are often the people who hate a country’s true ideals but need to fool folks into thinking the opposite so they can trample on those ideals and have it called patriotism). Have a gander at this map of march locations for tomorrow. There are 16 in Wyoming—a state notoriously pulsing with Hamasniks. There are 18 in Oklahoma, that veritable hornet’s nest of antifa hooliganism. There are another 18 in my home state of West Virginia (go, Morgantown contingent!), where Marxism has obviously taken deep root among an unsuspecting populace. Once again, these are not mere lies from Johnson et alia. I make this distinction from time to time, and it’s worth making again here. A lie is a mere denial of truth—“I never said that” or “No, Mom, that isn’t my pot, I was just holding it for Mark.” What Republicans are doing here, as they do with such regularity, is more than lie. They invert the truth. They say its exact opposite. They do so with two express intentions: to make people believe that their political foes are doing that which they themselves are trying to get away with, and to make it easier to get away with defiling the Constitution. But don’t ask me. Let’s ask James Madison. Imagine that the chief author of the Constitution and Bill of Rights could watch tomorrow’s events and observe the post-event spin. What would he think? Whose side would he be on? It’s obvious. He’d be with the marchers. And it’s not even close. How do we know this? For a lot of reasons, but perhaps chief among them is Federalist 47, penned by Madison, which discussed the importance of separation of powers. One of the hallmarks of Trump 2.0—and indeed, from a constitutional point of view, perhaps the hallmark—is the way that, as Trump has made so many moves to concentrate power in his own hands, the other branches of government have supinely gone along with absolutely everything. Congress under Johnson and Senate Majority Leader John Thune is a joke, and as for the Supreme Court, well, it’s too tragic to be a joke. We’ve seen many examples of both branches bending over for Trump at every turn, but arguably, the most egregious one just happened: Trump diverting other monies to pay troops during the shutdown. As TNR’s Matt Ford shows here, it’s blatantly illegal. The Constitution says clearly that Congress appropriates such funds. Trump claimed the power to do so as commander in chief, but he has no such power. The Republican Congress has lain down and said fine. And the really pathetic thing here is that Congress could move a bill directing the payment of troops during the shutdown. It would pass easily. But that can’t happen because Johnson won’t call the House into session, because there’s a new Democrat waiting to be sworn in whose seating has potential ramifications for Trump with respect to the Jeffrey Epstein affair. Again, it all revolves around the wishes and perceived needs of Dear Leader. As for the Supreme Court, it has given Trump practically everything he’s asked for. It has defied him on a couple of minor occasions, but even on the most notable of those, its holding was vague and pusillanimous: It ruled in early April that the administration must “facilitate” the return to the country of Kilmar Abrego García, but it also held that a district court judge had gone too far in ruling that the administration had to “effectuate” his return (he was finally returned to the United States in June). But on almost all other matters, the court has given Trump exactly what he’s wanted. And this week, during the Voting Rights Act hearings, we saw a court majority working nakedly to advance the partisan goals of one political party and its president. Now—back to Madison. Federalist 47 was Madison’s brief to the citizenry in favor of the concept of separation of powers—and his argument to them that powers were sufficiently separated in this new Constitution so as to guard against tyranny. Because tyranny was his great concern. In fact, he wrote: “The accumulation of all powers, legislative, executive, and judiciary, in the same hands, whether of one, a few, or many, and whether hereditary, self-appointed, or elective [emphasis mine], may justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny.” This accumulation has not, I admit, happened in a legal sense. But in practice, this is precisely where we are today. So had Madison been among us these last nine months to observe what Trump and the Republicans and the court’s majority have done, there is no question that he would say: “Yes. This is tyranny.” I asked Michael Klarman of Harvard Law School, author of the amazing book The Framers’ Coup about the Constitutional Convention, for his thoughts on the relevance of all this. He emailed back: Madison and other Framers believed that “ambition would counteract ambition,” by which they meant largely that Congress would check an autocratically inclined executive. Madison and the other Framers were not anticipating the development of a party system, which actually happened quite soon after the founding. Today, all that matters to Republican members of Congress is that they support Trump, whether he is hiding something in the Epstein files, nominating incompetent people to run agencies, destroying congressionally created agencies, murdering people off the coast of Venezuela, or sending troops into American cities to oppress the people. Cowardly, toadying members of Congress are providing no check whatsoever on a tyrannical executive. It is an abandonment of their oaths, really no different from their predecessors who resigned their positions to join the Confederacy in 1860–61. And the courts? Klarman wrote, “Lower court judges are doing a great job in trying to check that executive. But the Supreme Court—out of some combination of fear, calculated effort not to be defied, and underlying agreement with much of Trump’s agenda—has mostly been complicit in Trump’s authoritarian project.” This is tyranny. We’re not lurching toward tyranny. It doesn’t loom on some hypothetical horizon. It’s here. Right now. Madison was right about tyranny. But obviously he was wrong that the Constitution was strong enough to guard against executive accumulation of power. He assumed, as Klarman put it, that the other branches would do their jobs. But Patrick Henry, the noted anti-federalist, turns out to have had the more sober view. In his speech against ratification, he anticipated people such as Donald Trump, Mike Johnson, and John Roberts: Where are your checks in this government? Your strongholds will be in the hands of your enemies. It is on a supposition that your American governors shall be honest, that all the good qualities of this government are founded; but its defective and imperfect construction puts it in their power to perpetrate the worst of mischiefs, should they be bad men; and, sir, would not all the world, from the Eastern to the Western hemisphere, blame our distracted folly in resting our rights upon the contingency of our rulers being good or bad? The Americans who are marching Saturday are the Americans who embrace Madison’s principle but have sadly come to acknowledge Henry’s insight. And they—not Trump, not Johnson, not Roberts—are the people who truly love this country. Johnson also said Wednesday that Saturday’s marchers are “the people who don’t want to stand and defend the foundational truths of this republic, and that’s what we’re here doing every single day.” As ever with these frauds, he was talking about himself. He may be dense enough not even to know it. But Saturday’s marchers know it all too well. David Axelrod is far better known these days for occasionally wagging his finger at his fellow Democrats than for breathing partisan fire, so it caught my eye when he posted this on X Wednesday: “So far, the ICE gang has shot & killed an unarmed man & lied about the circumstances; shot a woman 5 times for obstructing their vehicle; roughed up elderly women and zip-tied small children; shot a clergyman in the face with a pepper ball; marched through downtown Chicago, masked and armed. And they’re not going after the ‘worst of the worse,’ [sic] as promised. Most of the people they’re snagging have clean records. Some are citizens. To be clear: This is NOT making Chicago safer. It’s state-sponsored mayhem; dangerous political theater calculated to provoke.” Historians sometimes say that when societies are descending into fascism, it can be hard for the people to notice it in real time. Well, historians of the future, I’m here to tell you: We are noticing. Millions of us are noticing. And we are horrified and enraged. We are well aware: We once lived in a country that, for all its frequent imperfections, was a place where the rule of law was a broadly shared value and where leaders acted with democratic restraint. We now live in a country where there is no rule of law; where leaders, especially the president but also others who support him, spit on the idea not only of democratic restraint but of democracy itself; and where the timorous first reflex of nearly every member of one of our two political parties is, at virtually all times, to do precisely what the leader wants. That’s fascism. It may be—for now—a comparatively mild form of fascism. Political opponents aren’t being jailed or shot, opposition media outlets aren’t being shuttered, and books aren’t being burned. But a lot of things are happening that are terrifying. And last year, we lived in a country where the three scenarios I just listed were barely conceivable. Today, we live in a country where they are more likely only a matter of time. Let’s go back to Axelrod, and specifically, his use of the phrase “state-sponsored mayhem.” That is exactly what President Trump is imposing upon Chicago. To take just one of the incidents Axelrod cites: Pastor David Black of the First Presbyterian Church was with a small gaggle of protesters outside a Chicago ICE facility. Three agents stood on the roof of the two-story building as Black and the others stood on the sidewalk maybe 15 feet away from the building. Black raised his arms to the sky, as if in prayer. Someone who appears to be a fellow protester approached Black to confer with him. Next thing you see in this video is a considerable puff of smoke explode from Black’s forehead as he falls to the ground. That’s a clergyman. Exercising his First Amendment right (he’s fine, and he’s suing). Black later told CNN: “We could hear them laughing.” Shooting an unarmed and peacefully protesting pastor is by definition an act of state-sponsored mayhem. State-sponsored mayhem starts at the top, with the president’s thuggish, lawless threat to imprison the governor of Illinois and the mayor of Chicago (by the way—Greg Sargent speaks to said governor, JB Pritzker, on his Daily Blast podcast today). From there, the people with the uniforms and the badges and the guns get the message, and they go out and do the things Axelrod listed above. Administration officials pile lie upon lie upon lie. With respect to Portland, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt refers preposterously to “the radical left’s reign of terror” there. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem declares antifa to be “just as dangerous” as ISIS, which was killing perceived apostates by the thousands at its peak and raping little girls. Stephen Miller, Trump’s deputy chief of staff, rants nightly about armed confrontations that either don’t exist or exist solely because the administration creates them so it can have the footage that will air over and over on its propaganda network, Fox News. It’s all toward the purpose of erasing dissent, erasing democracy. As Zeteo’s Kim Wehle put it last week, reporting on two Trump-issued “national security” directives: “The president is taking steps to criminalize being anti-Trump in America.” When a president and his aides are doing that, it’s no longer America. When masked government thugs take potshots at a priest, it’s no longer America. When a handpicked hack prosecutor with no prosecutorial experience indicts two honorable American citizens within a month of the president ordering their prosecutions, and when two real prosecutors quit rather than pursue these obscenely political prosecutions, it’s no longer America. When the third-ranking official in the country, the speaker of the House of Representatives, delays the swearing-in of a duly elected member of that body because he knows she will vote to release files that potentially may shed light on unsavory behavior by the president, it’s no longer America. When the presidential administration announces that it’s going after nonprofit charitable groups that have operated unmolested in this country for decades under Democratic and Republican administrations because they donate to causes the president disfavors, it’s no longer America. When naturalized citizens are canceling overseas trips because they can’t be certain they’ll be welcomed back to their own country upon return, it’s no longer America. When the Department of Education is bullying universities into agreeing to a “compact” under which they’ll promise not to “belittle” conservative ideas, it’s no longer America. When the president and his family have used his office to enrich themselves to the tune of $3.5 billion in nine months, and when the Congress, controlled by the president’s party, refuses to do a thing about this rancid, dictator-level corruption, it’s no longer America. When the Supreme Court of the United States has sold its soul to all this barbarity, it’s no longer America. And when this thuggish dictator-wannabe is also a buffoonish man-child who sits there in his breathtakingly tacky Oval Office with his fake face and fake hair next to another head of state (the president of Finland) as he boasts yet again about passing a simple dementia test that a 10-year-old could ace, and we realize that this man-child is the sitting president, it’s no longer America, at least for anyone who cares about how we look to the rest of the world. Historians of the future: Rest assured, millions of us know all this in real time. We are horrified, shocked, enraged, and ashamed. We are acting, in a thousand ways, to oppose it. This cannot, and will not, be how the United States ends. President Donald Trump has finally told the truth about something. He’s embraced Project 2025. Anyone who believed his disavowals last year during the campaign is, of course, a fool. And the media, reporting those disavowals, looked foolish. Trump knew, as he has known all his life, that all you have to do is lie about something, and the press, following the rules of objectivity, will report straightforwardly what you said. So he largely got away with it. The Kamala Harris campaign tried to tie Trump to the project, as in this ad; but it didn’t manage to convey the project’s extremism with any force. And now? The Democrats have another huge opportunity to hang Project 2025 around Trump’s neck. It should be easier now, for two reasons. One, it’s not purely hypothetical anymore. According to the Project 2025 Tracker, a community-driven initiative, the Trump administration has already checked off 48 percent of the project’s goals. Two, Trump and OMB Director Russell Vought’s open promises to shred the federal bureaucracy give Democrats a huge target. The question is, do they have the skill—and the guts—to hit it? Alas, that question, as usual with the Democrats, should have a clear answer but doesn’t. The obvious strategy is to call all hands on deck and, now that Trump has said what he said, make this shutdown about not only Obamacare subsidies but two other things: about the looming job cuts themselves and about Vought personally because his name and his extremist, un-American goals to remake the United States as a Christian nation should be known to every American. The first message should be simple: What Trump and Vought are about to do here is the second coming of Elon Musk and DOGE. The DOGE effort was not exactly popular: Last spring, poll after poll, like this one, showed that while the general concept of cutting the size of the federal government had appeal, people really didn’t like the way Musk and his minions were going about it. This time around, Democrats can plausibly say that it’s going to be worse. DOGE staffing cuts came to around 300,000. An estimated 750,000 federal employees are being furloughed due to the shutdown. Vought probably thinks most of them are expendable. It shouldn’t be hard to make these cuts deeply unpopular. Second, tell Americans who Vought is, what he believes, the things he has said. He’s a Christian nationalist who believes Trump is “God’s gift” to America and wants the U.S. to be “a nation under God.” These are of course completely un-American ideas. Article 6 of the Constitution contains the “no religious test clause,” which applies to holding a public office or trust in the U.S.; but beyond that, the Founders were crystal clear that American citizenship and civil rights were open to all—as Thomas Jefferson once put it, citing John Locke, neither “Pagan nor Mohametan [Muslim] nor Jew ought to be excluded from the civil rights of the Commonwealth [of Virginia] because of his religion.” George Washington said that “religious controversies are always more productive of acrimony and irreconcilable hatreds than those which spring from any other cause,” and therefore each should be left to worship (or not) as he or she saw fit. I could go on and on and on. Making these two arguments requires the Democrats to take two moral and unambiguous stands. The first is in defense of an activist federal government. The second is in defense of the religious pluralism upon which this country was founded. I’d love to be able to write with confidence that I think they’ll do it. Odds are they won’t. Most of them shy away from moral arguments. They’re afraid—not all of them, but most of them—to go toe to toe with Trump on a topic like religion. There is utterly no reason for this. Most Americans agree with them. Polls will often show that a disturbingly high percentage of Americans want this country to be a Christian nation, but when you look at crosstabs, you see quickly that the number is high because among Republicans it’s around 75 percent. It’s well under 50 percent among independents, which is the number that matters. Still, the Democratic Party has trained itself over the years to stay away from such matters. They also just don’t speak with one voice and hold together. Right now, the only poll I’ve seen on the shutdown looks very good for them. A Washington Post survey found that respondents blamed Trump and Republicans over Democrats by 47 percent to 30 percent. Interestingly, independents blamed Republicans over Democrats by 50 percent to 22 percent. You’d think and hope that would gird Democrats’ loins. And maybe it will. But remember: Three Senate Democrats voted for the Republican version of the bill to reopen the government. Four more need to cave for the Republicans to get their bill through. Democratic senators are heading back to their states this weekend, where they’re going to hear from furloughed federal workers about how they need their paychecks. In a sense this is understandable and defensible. Democrats tend to care about these people’s actual lives, whereas Republicans don’t give a crap about them since they’re just a bunch of deep-state Trump haters anyway. Also, Democrats genuinely don’t want to see hundreds of thousands of federal employees lose their jobs, both on a simple human level and because Democrats believe these people are doing important work. So that’s all nice. But at the same time, the Democrats could win this fight. If the Post poll is right, they’re already winning. And now that Trump has introduced the unpopular Project 2025 into the equation, the door is open for the Democrats to make Trump’s posture here even more unpopular. Also, I’d argue that to the extent the shutdown will result in chaos, well, people understand that it’s Trump who is the sower of chaos in this country. Majorities are far more likely to blame Trump for chaos than Democrats. So the Democrats can win this. They need to stand together and stick to principles. I just wish history suggested they were better at this. The suspension of Jimmy Kimmel was about the 2,786th objectionable thing this second Trump administration has done. Many of its attacks on the American way of life have been utterly horrific—some have been direct assaults on the rule of law, others have sent completely innocent human beings to detention camps. So why does an action taken against a late-night host stand out? It’s a frontal attack on the one element of our social contract that nearly everyone, from left to right, agrees on and values more than anything: freedom of speech. The delegates to the Constitutional Convention in the summer of 1787 decided against including a Bill of Rights, confident that everyone would understand that the federal government would exercise only the powers enumerated in the document itself. But many critics, mostly those known as the anti-Federalists, insisted that that wasn’t enough. They said: Add a list of specifically enumerated rights, or we’re not ratifying. And so, James Madison, who had been a strong opponent of such a list in 1787, turned around and, as a member of the first U.S. Congress representing the fifth district of Virginia, drew up the list the critics demanded. His original list included 17 rights. Congress passed 12, and the states ratified 10. There was never any question as to which right would be enumerated first. The First Amendment concerns both religion and speech, but over the centuries, freedom of worship has grown less contested, and it has been the cause of free speech rights for which people have fought and gone to prison. Historically, most attempts to suppress speech have come from those in power trying to silence various forms of protest or dissent (hence, from the right, generally speaking). Recent years have seen the emergence of a small but vocal anti–free speech left, whose presence is mostly limited to social media and college campuses, and which is about to make Bari Weiss a very rich woman. But the vast majority of us agree: Free speech is inviolate and applies to all of us, even those with noxious views. A poll last year found that 63 percent of Americans considered free speech “very important.” It was second only to inflation and ahead of crime, health care, immigration, and seven other issues. Not bad for an abstract idea. But abstract ideas last only as long as those who have power—political and financial power—agree that they should last. James Madison couldn’t have contemplated Donald Trump. And he never would have imagined Perry Sook and Chris Ripley. Wait, who are Perry Sook and Chris Ripley, you ask? They are the men, Sook in particular, who made this Kimmel cancellation, this direct attack against free speech, happen. Their names don’t appear in many news stories. More people need to know who they are. Sook is the CEO of Nexstar Media Group. He started the company in the 1990s with one local television station, in Scranton, Pennsylvania. Today, Nexstar owns 197 stations. It also operates NewsNation, the cable news channel trying to compete with Fox, CNN, and MSNBC. NewsNation is where disgraced CNN anchor Chris Cuomo landed, and its “talent” is somewhat ideologically mixed. But Sook, 66, has dropped broad hints in past interviews about his own leanings. Last November, he expressed the hope that “fact-based journalism will come back into vogue, as well as eliminating the level of activist journalism out there.” You might think that by “activist journalism,” he means, you know, the cable news network that paid a $787 million settlement to a private company to avoid being forced to admit that it told lies about the 2020 election. But you’d be wrong. On Wednesday, he showed us what and who he means by “activist journalism”: Jimmy Kimmel, over one comment that right-wing social media went to town on. Chris Ripley is the CEO of the Sinclair Broadcast Group. Sinclair is better known than Nexstar. It vaulted to public prominence after that chilling 2018 video went viral of dozens of local Sinclair anchors reading from the same Orwellian script about “fake news.” Sinclair is more avowedly right-wing than Nexstar. But they both passionately share and are pursuing one central right-wing goal: the end of media regulation in the United States. Under FCC rules, no single owner can reach more than 39 percent of households. These kinds of regulations go back to the 1920s, when radio first hit the scene, and they were designed to make sure that Americans heard a range of voices. No one on either end of the political spectrum challenged them for decades. In the late 1960s, a Pennsylvania right-wing radio preacher (why is it always people like this?) went on air to smear a local journalist who had attacked Barry Goldwater. The matter went up to the Supreme Court, which held—unanimously, left to right—that the FCC’s Fairness Doctrine was consistent with the First Amendment: That is, the court said, yes, the exposure to opposing viewpoints was an essential part of democracy. Traditional news and speech values, imperfect though they were, held for about six decades. Then merger mania hit in the 1980s, and we began to understand that media companies were companies—were interested in profit more than civic ideas such as truth and free speech. At the same time, the Reagan administration started going after the Fairness Doctrine. Later came Rupert Murdoch and Fox. Then came merger after merger after merger. Sad to say, it was Barack Obama’s FCC, under Chair Julius Genachowski, that finally killed off the Fairness Doctrine officially, but it had been long since functionally dead anyway. Right now, Sook awaits FCC approval of a merger that will allow Nexstar to be in more than 39 percent of American homes. And Sinclair wants to grow and grow. And that is what happened Wednesday night. Sook announced that his 32 ABC stations would not broadcast Kimmel’s show. Sinclair, with its 30 ABC affiliates, made a similar announcement shortly thereafter. And ABC—or really, Disney—caved. Even so, this might not have been quite the crisis it is with someone else in the White House. Under President Kamala Harris, for example, would Sook and Nexstar even be petitioning a Democratic FCC for this merger? Probably not. The current Democratic commissioner, Anna Gomez, has clearly stated her opposition (to TNR’s Greg Sargent, among others) to what Chairman Brendan Carr did in threatening ABC and Kimmel. Recent Democratic FCC Chairs Jessica Rosenworcel (Biden) and Tom Wheeler (Obama) have been strong voices for media diversity. It seems to me a safe bet that under President Harris, none of this would be happening. But she is not in the White House. Donald Trump is. And a right-wing hero was just assassinated. Trump and his movement will use Charlie Kirk’s murder to justify any number of unconstitutional and illegal actions. And it filters down from them. Clemson University has fired five faculty and administrators. Teachers are losing their jobs over their social media posts about Kirk. And it sure isn’t Trump firing them. He has created an atmosphere of fear that many, many others on down the right-wing food chain, from Sook and Ripley to local school administrators, will zealously enforce. And that’s why this week is different. It pitted a near-universally cherished American value against a combination of corporate power and authoritarian contempt for that value—and the value was smashed to pieces. If you’re terrified of where all this may end, you are right to be. Stephen Colbert is gone; Kimmel, possibly gone for good (I hope not). CBS is becoming conservative. Skydance, the company handing CBS to Bari Weiss, may be about to take over CNN. The Washington Post is cracking up. The New York Times faces another one of Trump’s $15 billion lawsuits. In this next year or two, we may well be counting on the Times to do what CBS and ABC have refused to do and fight this battle to the bitter end. The text of the First Amendment was edited down from Madison’s original language. His first-draft passage on speech and the press said: “The people shall not be deprived or abridged of their right to speak, to write, or to publish their sentiments; and the freedom of the press, as one of the great bulwarks of liberty, shall be inviolable.” I wish that language had remained—it’s clearer and more emphatic, especially that “inviolable” part. It might have stiffened the backs of the people we’re going to be counting on to preserve free speech in this country and made it harder for right-wing federal judges to chip away at these rights. It would not, alas, make any difference to tyrants, and as of Wednesday night, it’s clearer than it ever was before that tyranny is where we’re headed. I will admit that I learned some useful things about Charlie Kirk this week. I learned that he commanded a unique respect and even ardor on the MAGA right. Old high school friends who are MAGA pop up regularly on my Facebook feed, and they were distraught, several to the point of tears. They had him pegged for a future president, which sure had never occurred to me, but which made sense after I gave it some thought. He was young, articulate, nice-looking; possessed of a certain kind of charisma. He had an instinct for how to connect with young men emotionally. I’ve also read some liberals who knew him saying in these last couple of days that he was, in person, unfailingly polite, and that matters. This is the Kirk the right remembers: someone who engaged in civil debate and persuasion and who infuriated liberals only because he was smart and he usually won. Kirk’s most ardent fans can, and will, believe what they want. The truth is that he infuriated a lot of us because he spread toxic lies across this country like a blanket of Agent Orange (David Corn and Joan Walsh iterated a number of them this week). And while he often had an impressive battery of facts at his command, his manner of debating involved a lot of dishonest rhetorical legerdemain. I watched a clip Thursday in which he challenged a young white male student somewhere: “What can a white man do in this country that a Black man can’t do?” It’s a very clever question. That framing—the use of the verb “do”—reduces racism to matters of the freedom to move about in society. And in that sense, what’s the problem? Yes, we once had white and “colored” waiting rooms down South, but these days, a Black father can take his kids to a ballgame just the same as a white father can. But a real conversation about racism means talking, for example, about the historical legacies that have resulted in white households owning on average $250,400 in wealth and Black households $24,520. That’s a direct result of Blacks not being allowed to buy houses in most neighborhoods in this country until relatively recently. In addition, there is still tons of discrimination in mortgage lending. That’s what racism is, and the fact that Black men can “do” a lot of what white men can “do” in this country does nothing to mitigate these persistent facts—facts that only liberals, by the way, have ever had the courage to try to change. Was Kirk’s assassination a tragedy? It was absolutely a tragedy. Whether the killer had a political motivation or not, the silencing of a voice, even a toxic voice, in that fashion is ghastly. If you spend enough time online (and here’s a good reason why you shouldn’t), you’ll be able to find people, seemingly somewhere on the left of the political spectrum, chortling over Kirk’s death. It’s an understatement to say that this is very bad form. But you’ll struggle to find any prominent liberal leaders or elected Democrats saying anything like, oh, for example, the insanely irresponsible things Mike Lee—a U.S. senator!—said when Minnesota Democrat Melissa Hortman and her husband were executed by a right-wing extremist. Here’s what I have seen, though: I’ve seen a number of figures on the right saying, instantly and well in advance of an assailant being identified (news that the alleged gunman was arrested didn’t break until Friday morning) that “the left” was responsible for Kirk’s death. Dozens of them, from Donald Trump on down, jumped immediately to this conclusion. They did this to a ferocious degree after both assassination attempts on Donald Trump’s life. Especially after the first one, many prominent figures on the right started pointing fingers at people and organizations on the broad left (The New Republic included) for having Trump’s blood on their hands. This was relentless for about three days; I remember it very well. Then it turned out that would-be assassin Matthew Crooks in fact had no particular political motivation—he was a bullied loner probably seeking notoriety. But during those first days, it was taken as a given on the right that Crooks was a Trump-hating leftist. The second attempt on Trump’s life came a scant two months later. You might have thought, given how wrong they were the first time, they would have waited. But again, many figures on the right rushed to say Ryan Routh was a registered Democrat, which he once was but hadn’t been for a long time. This time, in fairness, figures on the left pointed to other evidence saying Routh had Republican sympathies. But it turns out that he is just a confused man, as he proved this week in (as fate would have it) Judge Aileen Cannon’s courtroom where he is on trial for the assassination attempt—and where his rambling opening statement touched on Adolf Hitler, Henry Ford, and the Wright brothers. The right always jump to such conclusions, and to talk of revenge, not justice. The biggest jumper of all is Trump himself, who delivered an absolutely chilling address Wednesday night from the Oval Office. He said his administration would ferret out “those who contributed to this atrocity and to other political violence, including the organizations that fund it and support it, as well as those who go after our judges, law enforcement officials, and everyone else who brings order to our country.” If another president had said something like that, we could take it as playing to his peanut gallery. But when Trump says it, we should assume that he and his movement mean it. “Those who contributed to this atrocity” could mean thousands of people and organizations, and “other political violence” can mean anything Trump and Stephen Miller want it to mean. They will use this tragic event to try to bully non-Trump America into submission. Some people on the right are genuinely in mourning. They may choose not to see the sides of Charlie Kirk they don’t wish to see (and I’m still having trouble understanding how spewing such hatred and provocation is consistent with the teachings of Jesus Christ), but that’s what grieving human beings often do—right, left, and in between. Let them mourn in peace. But Trump and many leaders on the right are vowing to use this tragedy to do what they’ve always wanted to do anyway: to make this a more authoritarian society in which blunt criticism of the regime becomes redefined as incitement to violence and even terrorism. On Thursday, the State Department warned immigrants not to mock Kirk’s death. In Trump’s America, we can be sure it’s not going to stop there. More ghastly, parallel-universe news this week. The man in charge of America’s public health said he didn’t know how many people died of Covid and added, despite his ignorance, that he is certain that the Covid vaccine has killed more people than Covid itself did (all this while he’s denying Americans access to the Covid vaccine). We committed a probable act of war against Venezuela. The president of the United States was mocked by the leaders of China, Russia, and India. And as of Friday, the Department of Defense is apparently going back to the future and becoming the Department of War, I guess because “defense” is too passive a cognomen for the real men of MAGA-land. But maybe the most ominous development of the week doesn’t concern the Trump administration at all. It’s the news that Bari Weiss is apparently about to become the head, or something, of CBS News. This is bad for CBS, sure. But it’s a lot bigger than that: It is the securing for the right wing of another key beachhead in the American media landscape, which, as I’ve warned repeatedly, will within a generation (or sooner) consist of a lot of large, noisy, avowedly right-wing outlets and a small handful of mainstream outlets that are too weak and feckless to defend what remains of our democracy—and will thus be acting as the handmaidens of their own destruction, if they aren’t already. This is certainly an “only in America” story, but I do not mean that in the normal, heroic sense. I mean it in the creepy, corporate, it’s-all-about-profit sense. CBS began life in 1927 as a radio network, expanding into television as that medium grew. It had entertainment and news divisions, and later sports; its news division was considered the best in the United States, and, along with the British Broadcasting Corporation, a model for mainstream media standards in democracies. It wasn’t being “liberal” when Edward R. Murrow helped take down Joe McCarthy. It was acting in defense of democracy against a sinister and dishonest demagogue. Over the decades—and this was a natural-enough progression—CBS became a huge corporation, expanding into movies, amusements, even musical instruments (it was said to have ruined Fender guitars for about 20 years, although today those guitars—I own one—are considered vintage, go figure). But even this wasn’t so horrible, until the age of megamergers brought on by what was essentially the end of antitrust enforcement in the U.S. Fade in, fade out: CBS formed Viacom, then they split, then they remerged. Paramount, which had owned part of CBS back in the 1930s, came back into the picture. In 2009, Paramount announced a partnership with this new thing called Skydance, which had been created in 2006 by David Ellison. In July 2024, Skydance and Paramount, now CBS’s parent, announced their intention to merge. You will recall what happened next. That fall, as the merger was under governmental review, and during the presidential campaign, 60 Minutes broadcast an interview with Vice President Kamala Harris. With no evidence, Donald Trump charged that it was edited to make Harris look good. And so, exactly 70 years after CBS (and Murrow) took down one demagogue, it cowered and crumbled when confronted by another. The reason was obvious: Ellison and others wanted Trump’s Justice Department to approve the merger. In other words, profit was put ahead of the journalistic reputation of CBS News’s crown jewel program. CBS—actually, Paramount Global—decided to pay Trump $16 million (toward his “library”). It was an implicit admission that maybe Trump was right; that their most venerated news program perhaps was guilty of liberal bias, even though Trump never produced one lick of evidence that 60 Minutes had done anything wrong, anything that wasn’t part of standard broadcast practice. But Trump was clearly appeased, and, lo and behold, two months ago, the Trump administration approved the merger. On August 7, Ellison gave a press conference in New York, where he swore that no favors had been promised Trump. “We are not going to politicize anything today,” Ellison said. “We want to entertain first.” One can call Bari Weiss many things, but “apolitical” is not among them. She’s undoubtedly smart, and, with her wildly successful Substack publication The Free Press, she cunningly saw a market niche in identifying private-school wokery—rather than, say, the fact that one of our two major political parties is descending into fascism—as the gravest threat to the American way of life. I readily concede that what we call “wokeism” contains some excesses, some illiberal manifestations that run counter to the values of tolerance and open-minded debate. But the idea that students and administrators at a handful of universities are a bigger danger to democracy than Donald Trump and JD Vance and Pete Hegseth and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is absurd and dangerous. That is the view, however, of a certain slice of the American elite: wealthy people who tend to have gone to those schools, or who send their kids to them, and who, while not openly racist or sexist in most cases, nevertheless get the heebie-jeebies from all those Black and brown and trans people screaming about their rights—and who, more than anything else, in fact far more than anything else, want their tax cuts. And soon, CBS News will reflect their priorities and tell them the stories about the threats to the U.S. that they want to hear. In doing so, it will join not only Fox News and Newsmax and Sinclair, which increasingly controls local media. The Washington Post too appears to be traveling in that direction. In a few years, there just won’t be much mainstream media left. And I hate to say this, but that is partly their fault too. Weiss first became famous at The New York Times, when she expertly parlayed a hullabaloo over a controversial op-ed by GOP Senator Tom Cotton into a victimhood narrative about left-wing intolerance. She published a resignation letter that was praised by Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, and Donald Trump Jr., among others. All that attention led to her getting the funding to launch and grow The Free Press, for which David Ellison is now reportedly paying her at least $100 million, maybe more. An American success story, I suppose. But here’s the thing. The Times never should have been hiring someone like Weiss in the first place. She was at The Wall Street Journal editorial page before. Ask yourself: Has the Journal opinion page ever hired a liberal away from the Times? Maybe, although I can’t think of one. But in 2017, after Trump won, the Times hired both Weiss and Bret Stephens from the Journal. And at some point in there, the Times hired yet another young right-winger, Adam Rubenstein, who was the primary editor of the Cotton op-ed. Well, a Times defender would say, the liberal Times is more committed to diverse viewpoints than the conservative Journal, and that is a good thing. Up to a point, that’s true. And once upon a dear old time, a newspaper like the Times could hire, say, William Safire—hack and propagandist though he was—as an act of magnanimity to give a prominent platform to a conservative voice because conservative voices were indeed underrepresented in the media at the time. But that is hardly the case now. It brings to mind that old joke about some liberals being so open-minded that their brains start falling out of their ears. That open-mindedness, to circle us back to where we started, is on regular display at the Times these days, as I noted a month ago. The RFK Jr. Senate hearing Thursday was a shitshow. He obfuscated, he lied, he evaded, he humiliated himself. He is dismantling his agency and destroying public health. People will die because of his decisions, if they aren’t already. All of this was on horrid display Thursday. And the Times’ original headline on its account of the hearing? “A Defiant Kennedy Defends Vaccine Changes and C.D.C. Shakeup.” Great. Kennedy was savaged by senators of both parties for his lies and for shredding American public health to pieces, and the Times rewards him with the adjective “defiant.” Be assured that Bari Weiss’s CBS won’t be guilty of such equivocation in the name of “fairness.” That’s the difference, and that’s a big part of the reason why this democracy is dying. Donald Trump has, of course, done a lot of shocking things as president, things even previous Republicans wouldn’t have done. We focus most of our coverage on those things, and rightly so. But on one issue, he’s been a pretty standard Republican president, which is to say to say he’s been horrible and wicked in the standard way. The issue is guns. Before the Minneapolis shooting fades out of the news cycle, let’s look at the grisly Trump record, which has largely passed under the radar. We begin with his February 7 executive order called “Protecting Second Amendment Rights.” It stated in the opening paragraph: “Because it is foundational to maintaining all other rights held by Americans, the right to keep and bear arms must not be infringed.” It then directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to review existing laws and regulations and so on “to assess any ongoing infringements of the Second Amendment rights of our citizens.” This has led to a process that seeks to restore the gun rights of convicted felons. And so, on July 18, the Justice Department published a rule to that effect. The press release’s opening sentence reads: “President Trump directed the Department of Justice to address the ongoing infringements of the Second Amendment rights of our citizens—all of them.” Further down, the release quotes Ed Martin, the administration’s pardon attorney and a MAGA extremist whose nomination for a U.S. Attorney position was withdrawn because he probably couldn’t get the votes: “General Bondi’s support of the rebooted 925(c) program is consistent with President Donald J. Trump’s promise to the American people to support the beautiful Second Amendment.” So that’s number one: The DOJ is going out of its way to restore gun rights to convicted felons—a category, of course, that includes Donald Trump himself. But the EO and other actions by the administration go a lot farther. Trump ordered a review of every gun-regulating move made by the Biden administration. For example, on April 7, Bondi revoked a Biden-era rule that allowed the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives to rescind the licenses of gun dealers that break the law by falsifying records. Ponder that: Businesses that knowingly break the law now have immunity from federal oversight. There’s plenty more. On May 16, the administration agreed to a settlement of several lawsuits under which the Justice Department would no longer enforce machine-gun ban laws (which date to the 1930s) against guns with forced-reset trigger (FRT) devices. An FRT, which is a recently developed technology, allows the shooter to fire at an increased rate. The NRA and manufacturers say it’s no big deal, the shooter still has to fire each shot separately; gun-safety advocates counter that by mechanically resetting the trigger position after a shot is fired, FRT’s still dramatically increase the fire rate, essentially turning some semiautomatic weapons into machine guns. So these will now be sold again. FRT’s have been after-market devices, but now, they might be installed at point of sale. The Republicans’ big, ugly budget bill factors in here, too. A transfer tax on silencers has been part of U.S. law since 1934. The tax was imposed for the obvious reason that silencers tended to be used by the bad guys. You don’t need silencer to shoot a grouse or defend your family from an intruder. It was paid by either the buyer or seller and was set at $200. In all those decades, it was never raised ($200 then would be close to $4,900 today). But at least it existed. As of next January 1, it will be $0. This is who Trump is: a cynical and strictly transactional person who, once upon a time, spoke reasonably sensibly about guns, but who realized once he entered politics that anyone who wants the GOP presidential nomination has to sell his soul to the NRA, so he sold his (probably wasn’t expensive). This is another thing we kind of stopped paying attention to, because he does so many other things that are, or appear to be, so much more outrageous. But I take note every year of what Trump tells the NRA. In the summer of 2024, he spoke to the group in person and said, among other things: • “Let there be no doubt the survival of our Second Amendment is very much on the ballot. You know what they want to do. If they get in, our country’s going to be destroyed in so many ways. But the second Amendment will be … It’s under siege. But with me, they never get anywhere.” • “If the Biden regime gets four more years, they are coming for your guns, 100% certain. Crooked Joe has a 40-year record of trying to rip firearms out of the hands of law-abiding citizens.” • “They’re going after the ammunition. When the radical-left Democrats tried to use Covid to shut down gun sales during the China virus, I proudly designated gun and ammunition retailers as critical infrastructure so they couldn’t touch it.” This April, the group convened in Atlanta, and Trump addressed the assemblage via video, bragging about all the above and more, saying: “There is much more to come. Americans are born free, and under the Trump administration, we will live free—always live free. With me in the White House, your sacred rights will not be infringed.” Now, after Minneapolis, Vice President JD Vance and Melania Trump are out there trying to shift the topic from guns to mental health. It’s a total dodge, an attempt to talk about anything but guns; but okay, we have an obvious five-alarm mental healthcare crisis in this country, so to the extent that this administration really wants to do something about that—great. But as usual, the rhetoric is completely the opposite of the reality. The drastic Medicaid cuts in the big, ugly bill will impact mental health services in a vast array of ways. MindSite News, which covers mental health policy, wrote after the bill became law: “The previous five years—including the final year of Trump’s first presidency—had seen the renewal of a federal commitment to mental health. Over those years, federal funding for mental health services increased. New programs like the 988 hotline were created and funded. Funding streams were established to boost crisis response services and to support school-based mental health. Tough new health insurance regulations were enacted to improve access to coverage for mental health services.” That last point is especially key. Insurers don’t cover mental health the way they cover physical health (this, by the way, is an issue the Democrats should seize; mental health doesn’t interest the media much, but I guarantee you it is of keen interest to parents everywhere, of all political stripes). But this bill, the site notes, signals that “the days of a federal commitment to addressing the U.S. mental health crisis are essentially over.” So they’re even hypocrites on the one issue on which they’re showing “concern.” But let’s conclude by going back to gun policy. The guns purchased by the Minneapolis shooter were bought legally. Press accounts note this and then quickly move on, as if to say there’s no point in discussing gun laws here. But there is. There always is. Authorities haven’t revealed what kinds of guns, beyond saying there were three—a shotgun, a rifle, and a pistol. Maybe they’re not even in the categories of weapons we debate. I’d still like to know how someone with such obvious mental health issues passed the background checks. Minnesota strengthened its background check law under Governor Tim Walz in 2023, but someone somewhere still decided that Robin Westman could own guns responsibly, and we deserve to know more about who and why. In the meantime, Trump 2.0 so far shows every sign of doing anything the NRA wants it to do. They can offer all the thoughts and prayers they want, and they can prattle on about mental health until the sun sets. But it’s their actions that matter, and their actions say they’re perfectly content to let more children die. This article first appeared in Fighting Words, a weekly TNR newsletter authored by editor Michael Tomasky. Sign up here You may not know the name Lindsey Halligan. She’s not a scholar. Not a Ph.D. She hasn’t written any books on history. She has, however, worked as an insurance claims lawyer. Her most celebrated achievement, apparently, was defeating a 2019 claim seeking $500,000 in damages from her client over a damaged roof. How she managed to join Trump’s defense team remains unclear, but she was called to Mar-a-Lago the day the FBI came in with its warrant to collect those classified documents. Once on the team, she did what they all do, namely, grovel—she made an appearance on Steve Bannon’s podcast where she vowed to sue CNN for claiming that Trump was lying about the 2020 election results. Trump sought $475 million in damages in that case, but in July 2023, a federal judge dismissed it. Today, Halligan holds something few others in government probably do: a very fancy title that runs to a full 19 words (Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy and the Special Assistant to the President and Senior Associate Staff Secretary). She is overseeing the … what’s the right word here? There are so many to choose from … “reimagining” of the Smithsonian Institution. That’s right. An insurance claims lawyer is now in charge of making sure that the Smithsonian’s 21 museums, 21 libraries, 14 research centers, one zoo, and 157 million items and artifacts are brought into line with the wishes of the Mad King. I see, looking back over them, that the tone of the above two paragraphs is a bit jocular. But this is no laughing matter. Forget Halligan. Maybe she’s smarter than I think, maybe she’s not. Maybe she’s a hardcore racist, maybe she’s not. But she’s not the point. The point here is Trump. He is not smarter than I think. I suspect he’s never read a history book in his life, and chances are pretty decent he’s never been to a museum, except to galas Ivana dragged him to back when. And about his hardcore racism, there is utterly no question. But we don’t talk about it enough. Trump long ago established to the satisfaction of everyone outside of MAGA world that he’s a racist to the bone. He and his father wouldn’t rent to Black people. He said those sick things about the defendants in the Central Park jogger case (they weren’t guilty). He said, “Laziness is a trait in Blacks.” He said some white supremacists in Charlottesville were “very fine people.” I could go on and on. Being long-established, Trump’s racism is not “news.” Regular readers of mine will know this is one of my longtime complaints about the nature and structure of the media. There are lots of things that aren’t “news,” per se, but are true, important, and defining of our reality. Trump’s racism is one of those things. It hovers over everything. It defines nearly everything he does. And it is making the United States of America a cruel, sick, mean place. His racism is what’s propelling this edict over the Smithsonian. “The Smithsonian is OUT OF CONTROL, where everything discussed is how horrible our Country is, how bad Slavery was,” he whined Tuesday on Truth Social. When he talks this way, he’s sending a much broader message that is widely understood, by both his political foes and (especially) his supporters. Each group knows it’s part of a broader attack that is designed to keep certain Americans “in their place.” It’s just that the latter group approves. His racism is what’s driving the presence of these National Guard troops in Washington, D.C. His motorcade, traveling from the White House to his Virginia golf club, passes a small greensward along what’s called the E Street Expressway where there are (or were) a few tents, and that’s probably how he got his entire impression of D.C. crime, along with the background knowledge that D.C. is a heavily Black city (Black residents are no longer a majority, but still a plurality). The troops aren’t even fighting actual crime. They’re mostly around the National Mall, where it’s as safe as Mayberry in the 1960s. The troops are just a symbol for white MAGA world that he’s cracking some Black heads. His racism is behind this sick redistricting madness in Texas. Nonwhite people make up 60 percent of the state’s population. By the time the Texas legislature is finished, the Texas congressional delegation will likely be more than 70 percent white and Republican. In Missouri, the redistricting under consideration would slice a Black Democratic district in Kansas City into maybe three different pieces. Republicans have done this sort of thing long before Trump, but under Trump, of course, it’s being taken to extremes because Republicans now know that anti-Black extremism on such matters is the only thing that gets the boss’s attention. His racism is behind his talk about mail-in ballots and early voting and all his phony allegations about fraudulent voting. Everybody knows very well what, and whom, he’s talking about when he talks about such things. He means Black and, to a slightly lesser extent, Latino people. His racism is the fundamental reason for these mass detentions. Would Trump, and the right wing in general, be this worked up about illegal border crossings if it was mostly white people doing it? Of course they wouldn’t. There would be no rhetoric about immigrants “poisoning the blood” of the nation. Finally—although surely there’s more—it’s racism that animates a lot of his rhetorical attacks on individual Americans. It’s no accident that his recent targets prominently include Oprah Winfrey, Gayle King (her close friend), Beyoncé, Al Sharpton, Letitia James, and Charlamagne tha God. He goes after lots of people of all races, but Black people are disproportionately targeted, and it’s not an accident. I have no idea where Lindsey Halligan fits in here. She’s spent most of her adult life thinking about hurricanes. She’s interchangeable with any other Mar-a-Lago sycophant who happened to be in the right place at the right time. But the fact that Trump put someone in charge of remaking the Smithsonian who’s totally unqualified is what’s important here because it tells us that the person is there solely to follow his orders. Trump’s orders will be based on his worldview. And his worldview is the most blatantly and openly racist worldview that’s been held by an American president since Woodrow Wilson. We need to remember this—even, or especially, when the media forgets. Republican Representative Bryan Steil thought it would be a good idea to go have a meetup with constituents Thursday night in Elkhorn, Wisconsin. Steil represents Paul Ryan’s old district and in fact used to work for Ryan. He’d had a rocky week: A few days before, some protesters plopped some flowers and a coffin on the doorstep of his Janesville home, an act meant to symbolize the ill effects of the Republicans’ big, ugly bill on the most vulnerable. Things didn’t get much better Thursday night. Steil was booed repeatedly, particularly on immigration, with one woman saying, with reference to Alligator Alcatraz: “The difference between a prison or a detention center and a concentration camp is due process.” Asked another, about ICE agents, to robust applause: “Why are they wearing masks, and why are they unidentified?” Congress is in recess now for the new month, so we can be sure that Steil’s fellow Republicans took note and will spend the month hiding from constituencies and hanging out at country clubs where tax cuts for the rich are popular and nobody needs Medicaid (or at least they think they don’t). Donald Trump, it is said, is frustrated. He wonders why he’s not more popular. He complains, we read, that he’s accomplished a great deal and that he’s keeping his campaign promises, and looked at a certain way, these statements are true, to a point. So he can’t figure out why he’s at 37 percent. I could tell him why. Two reasons, and they’re both obvious. First, his policies are horrible, and people don’t like them. If you’re “accomplishing” things that large majorities of people don’t want, do they count as accomplishments? Film director Uwe Boll somehow manages to keep making movies. But he’s a punch line. Most of his movies have been commercial flops and critical train wrecks—a career so lame that he once promised to quit the business if a petition demanding that he do so garnered a million signatures (alas, it fell short). That’s Trump: the Uwe Boll of policy. The recent polls have told us over and over and over. The big, ugly bill—unpopular. Rounding up poor guys hanging out at Home Depot looking for work—unpopular. Putting people in, yes, concentration camps—unpopular. Cutting his Palm Beach pals’ taxes—unpopular. Imposing these absurd tariffs—unpopular. I could go on. There is literally not a single important item on the Trump domestic agenda that polls well. Then there are the promises he’s broken. He said he’d lower prices on day one. Which, you’ll recall, was the same day on which he was going to end Russia’s war on Ukraine. And bring peace to the Middle East. It’s a pleasant surprise here lately that he’s talking smack about Putin and Netanyahu because they’re gumming up his glide path to the Nobel Peace Prize. But his criticisms don’t change the fact that the crises in both Ukraine and Gaza have gotten worse, not better, since he took office. Look, I’m glad that he’s flip-flopped on aid to Ukraine. But still, it’s a flip-flop. I remember when Republicans thought flip-flopping on a matter of war and peace was a sign of weakness. So that’s number one. He has either (1) executed his policies as promised, but people hate them, or (2) blown them off or reversed himself, exposing his campaign statements as nonsense. That the Harris campaign couldn’t figure out how to mock his obvious bullshit—don’t get me started. One thing I’m not celebrating this summer is Kamala Harris’s reemergence on the public stage, and I pray she’s not delusional enough to think she ought to run again in 2028. Number two is also simple. He’s a sleazeball, and more and more people are finally coming to realize it. The Jeffrey Epstein matter is Exhibit A, of course, but there is much more. The way he and his family are getting rich from the presidency is just obscene. Have you ever gone to TrumpStore.com? If not, have a look. It’s relentlessly garish, of course, but more than that, it’s relentlessly and proudly, defiantly overpriced. Yet these idiots buy this crap by the millions. But it’s Epstein that is catching up with him. And that story is a long, long way from being over. We cannot of course at this point state that Trump is guilty of anything. But allegations are out there. Have you read the testimony of “Katie Johnson”? You might want to familiarize yourself with it. Obviously, I have no idea whether it’s true. If a third of it is, and it’s ever corroborated, it will be by far the biggest presidential scandal of all time. And even if none of it is true, we’re still dealing with a president of the United States whose best friend for 15 years was a serial child rapist. Let that sink in. Again, why the Democrats couldn’t make this an issue last year—aarrgh. I know. I’m sure they have all kinds of reasons. But you know what? If Donald Trump were running against someone whose best friend for 15 years was a serial child rapist, he’d have made sure America knew. In any case, they’re figuring it out now. And if he pardons Ghislaine Maxwell or commutes her sentence or anything like that, millions of Americans will jump to the obvious conclusion. It all leaves Bryan Steil and his GOP congressional colleagues ducking their constituents, because God forbid they have to explain to voters why they voted for a sick bill that punishes working people and lines the pockets of the megarich and will shove many billions of dollars into the creation of a police state no one wants. That would be accountability, which would be uncomfortably close to democracy. Can’t have that.

Title: Walking, talking humanoid robots are coming to society in 4-5 years: WEF

Humanoid robots will be walking and talking among us in the next four or five years, according to a discussion on tech regulation at the World Economic Forum (WEF). The joint WEF Annual Meetings of the Global Future Councils and Cybersecurity concluded on October 16, with discussions ranging from neurotech to food liberation and tech regulation. Speaking during the panel called “Regulation: Friend or Foe?” SandboxAQ CEO Jack Hidary said that humanoid robots would be entering society by 2030. “Introducing humanoid, walking, talking robots in our society is going to be a much bigger shock than any ChatGPT […] That’s only four-to-five years away”Jack Hidary, WEF Annual Meetings of the Global Future Councils and Cybersecurity, October 2025 "Introducing humanoid, walking, talking robots in our society is going to be a much bigger shock than any ChatGPT.. That's only 4-5 years away": SandboxAQ CEO Jack Hidary WEF Global Future Councils & Cybersecurity Meetings #AMGFCC25 https://t.co/Wj69Ccq95q pic.twitter.com/lpjkOPo2ua “This is going to be a very big shock to the system as we now have them [humanoid robots] enter into society. That’s only four or five years away“Jack Hidary, WEF Annual Meetings of the Global Future Councils and Cybersecurity, October 2025 “Right now in this room, as far as I know, we are all human, but four or five years from now at this very room when we have a global leadership futures council of the WEF in the UAE, we’re going to have humanoid robots in this room,” said Hidary. “They’ll be robots; they’ll be sitting in a chair; they’ll be taking notes, or doing other things, and we’re going to have to grapple with this as governments, as regulators, and as companies,” he added. One of the positives of having humanoid robots in society, according to Hidary, is that they are going to take care of the elderly in their own homes, so they don’t have to go to nursing homes. “As people get older, instead of having them go to a nursing home or other kinds of places, they can stay in their homes; they can be cared for by a robot”Jack Hidary, WEF Annual Meetings of the Global Future Councils and Cybersecurity, October 2025 “As people get older, instead of having them go to a nursing home or other kinds of places, they can stay in their homes. They can be cared for by a robot,” said Hidary. “I think we all think this is a very positive thing.” While robots looking after the elderly may be viewed as a positive thing, especially for those without family members, it does eliminate the human connection that people may crave. Let’s just hope it doesn’t turn into a dystopian sci-fi scenario like in the Netflix series “Cassandra” where the robot caregiver called Cassandra has some rather horrifying abandonment issues that lead to quite nefarious outcomes. Dystopian or not, Hidary said that “Introducing humanoid, walking, talking robots in our society is going to be a much bigger shock than any ChatGPT that we’ve now engaged with. “This is going to be a very big shock to the system as we now have them enter into society. That’s only four or five years away.” As far as which country will be best equipped to manage and integrate robots into society, Hidary made the case for Japan. “Japan I predict will be one of the society’s that best uses robots […] Because they have an aging society […] They see robots as part of the solution, not as a danger”Jack Hidary, WEF Annual Meetings of the Global Future Councils and Cybersecurity, October 2025 "Japan I predict will be one of the society's that best uses robots.. Because they have an aging society.. they see robots as part of the solution, not as a danger" SandboxAQ CEO Jack Hidary WEF Global Future Councils & Cybersecurity Meetings #AMGFCC25 https://t.co/Wj69Ccq95q pic.twitter.com/bYGOxTrZv2 Hidary praised Japan for preparing for the coming robots over the past 40 years while putting in place “regulations that make sure that robots are safe.” The SandboxAQ CEO’s words echo those of WEF interim co-chair and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink when he spoke at the 2024 WEF Special Meeting on Global Collaboration, Growth, and Energy Development. There, Fink argued that developed countries with shrinking populations would be better prepared for the social problems that come from “substituting humans for machines.” “I can argue in the developed countries the big winners are countries that have shrinking populations […] These countries will rapidly develop robotics and AI and technology […] The social problems that one will have in substituting humans for machines is going to be far easier in those countries that have declining populations”Larry Fink, WEF Special Meeting on Global Collaboration, Growth, and Energy Development, April 2024 Larry Fink tells the WEF depopulation is a good thing. "In developed countries the big winners are those with shrinking populations.. They'll rapidly develop robotics/AI.. transform productivity.. elevate living standards.. substitute humans for machines" https://t.co/iPDzO9wyDw pic.twitter.com/0Xrw2grWFp “We always used to think shrinking population is a cause for negative growth, but in my conversations with the leadership of these large, developed countries that have xenophobic immigration policies, they don’t allow anybody to come in, shrinking demographics — these countries will rapidly develop robotics and AI and technology,” said Fink in April, 2024. “And if the promise, and it’s going to happen, if the promise of all of that transforms productivity, which most of us think it will, we’ll be able to elevate the standard of living of countries, the standard of living of individuals, even with shrinking populations,” he added. While Fink didn’t mention Japan directly, his words align with those of Hidary about robotics and aging populations. Going back to what Hidary said about humanoid robots entering society in four or five years, what will it take to get there? We can look to the 2025 WEF Annual Meeting of the New Champions, aka “Summer Davos” for some insights. On June 24, 2025, University of Twente professor Vanessa Evers explained that a digital twin of the entire world would be required to achieve “true robot intelligence.” “For true robot intelligence, you need to build a model of the world, like a digital twin of the entire world”Vanessa Evers, WEF Annual Meeting of the New Champions, June 2025 "For true ROBOT INTELLIGENCE, you need to build a model of the world, like a DIGITAL TWIN OF THE ENTIRE WORLD.. We can add SUPERHUMAN CAPABILITIES [listen to your heart, watch your breath to detect stress & pain]" Vanessa Evers, WEF Summer Davos #AMNC25 https://t.co/2U3dFg5CP0 pic.twitter.com/0jPjGG6HpD “We could add superhuman capabilities, listen to the heartbeat or watch the breath of a person to know stress, to know pain. We can detect dominance, aggression, creative flow — there’s all things you could detect in an automated way”Vanessa Evers, WEF Annual Meeting of the New Champions, June 2025 Creating a digital twin of the entire world is an extremely complex undertaking that goes way beyond Large Language Models like ChatGPT. In order to achieve true robot intelligence, a Large Behavioral Model would be needed to access and process enormous data from real world phenomena, which is far more complicated than creating and feeding Large Language Models. “ChatGPT has to choose from 26 characters. What is the best next character? But what about the real world? Imagine vision alone and we don’t have hearing, touch, taste, everything like that — just seeing stuff — if you would freeze-frame and then predict what is the next thing that’s going to happen in the visual, it would be impossible to know at the pixel level”Vanessa Evers, WEF Annual Meeting of the New Champions, June 2025 "In theory it would be possible to train a robot like a LLM, but then a Large Behavioral Model – to use a lot of data from the real world & have it predict the next best action" Professor Vanessa Evers, "Social Robots and I" WEF Summer Davos #AMNC25 https://t.co/2U3dFg54Zs pic.twitter.com/AELHRvffQO According to Evers, “In theory it would be possible to train a robot like a Large Language Model, but then a Large Behavioral Model — to use a lot of data from the real world and have it predict the next best action. “A Large Language Model predicts what is the next best token, but of course that is super complicated in the real world.“ Getting back to Hidary, he believes, that through periodic meetings between stakeholders, humanoid robot regulation should have the capacity to update itself. He said, “One way to make sure there’s a level playing field for all players in the field is for the government to convene the players, to listen to them, and to keep a process that in the regulation itself, it says, every six months or something like that, there should be a convening of the key stakeholders, and we shall update it. “Put that into the regulation itself to recognize that any robot law we say today is irrelevant four or five years from now, and that law four or five years from now is irrelevant 10 years from now.” “Let’s build in the ability to update itself into the very regulation itself.” The special joint session of the WEF “Annual Meeting of the Global Future Councils and the Annual Meeting on Cybersecurity” convened more than 500 experts from business, government, civil society, academia and media, alongside 150 of the world’s foremost cybersecurity leaders from October 14-16 in Dubai, UAE.

A SECOND MAN has been found guilty of the murder of a man whose skeletonised remains were found in a jute bag in a ravine in Whitewell, Rostellan in East Cork last year. Kieran Quilligan (47) from Togher in Cork was last seen alive on 1 September 2023. He was missing for five months when his remains were detected on 29 January 2024 after gardaí brought a cadaver dog to scrubland in the county. The jury of ten men and two women at the Central Criminal Court in Cork heard that he had been beaten with a hammer like weapon. Mr Quilligan suffered multiple bone fractures. However, an exact cause of death could not be determined because of the decomposition of organs. The jury spent close to six hours deliberating before today finding Luke Taylor (27) previously of Cherry Lawn, Blackrock in Cork guilty of murder. His co accused Niall Long (33) formerly of St Michael’s Close in Mahon in Cork was yesterday found guilty of the murder of Mr Quilligan. Justice Siobhan Lankford thanked the jurors for their diligent service and excused them from jury service for a period of ten years. Both men now face mandatory life sentences. Long and Taylor were remanded in custody for sentencing on 29 October next at 10.30am. Meanwhile, over the course of the trial Prosecution senior counsel, Donal O’Sullivan, noted that the jury had watched a “staggering amount” of CCTV with gardaí harvesting thousands of hours of footage. O’Sullivan also indicated that but for the incredible garda investigation the remains of Mr Quilligan might never have been found. In his opening speech to the jury O’Sullivan said that the “instigating factor” in the murder was an incident where Kieran Quilligan and another man allegedly stole drugs and cash from Niall Long on 1 September 2023. The jury heard that Mr Quilligan left his apartment in Cork later that evening with Luke Taylor telling his partner he would be back in a matter of minutes. Mr Quilligan was tracked walking to St Finbarr’s Place in Cork city alongside Luke Taylor. He never emerged from the lane. The Prosecution evidence was that a car was brought to the top of the lane and that Mr Quilligan was bundled in to the boot. Advertisement The car was tracked going to Little Island in Co Cork and subsequently heading to Rostellan where the remains of the deceased were found on 29 January 2024. In his closing speech to the jury, O’Sullivan said that Kieran Quilligan was “lured” to his death by Luke Taylor. He stated that Taylor brought him to a laneway at St Finbarr’s Place in Cork city on 1 September 2023 where he and Long “ambushed” him. He described the activities of the two men as a joint enterprise. The jury also heard evidence from Assistant State Pathologist, Dr Margaret Bolster who carried out a postmortem on the remains of Mr Quilligan. Dr Bolster made an examination of the body at the scene. She described going down a ravine off a roadway where there was a jute grave. Underneath this was another jute gravel bag with a “pelvic bone protruding.” Dr Bolster said she could see ribs and a skull with a “bag around it tied with a knot.” The skull was separate from the body and there was a large amount of silt and vegetation. Dr Bolster noted a cable tie around the left ankle and right shin of the remains and two knotted pieces of plastic around the neck. She said that they were likely to have been used for the purposes of moving the body. Dr Bolster said that the injuries sustained by Mr Quilligan were consistent with a “severe assault in a laneway.” Those injuries included fractures to his ribs, chest, leg and hand bones, jaw bones, neck and skull. Dr Bolster said whilst the remains were skeletonised there was a small piece of skin remaining which consisted of a tattoo with the word “Mother” and a date. In the course of the trial the jury heard evidence from Garda James Byrd who said that on 8 September 2023 Luke Taylor called to Anglesea Street Garda Station. He said that he was “concerned for the welfare of his friend and wanted to assist gardaí.” He informed gardaí that he had been in the company of Quilligan on the night he was last seen but that they had parted ways in Cork city centre. The trial also heard evidence from Det Garda Anne O’Sullivan who said that in March of 2024 Luke Taylor sent a text to his girlfriend saying that this man Quilligan “was killed in an unknown place unknown time.” He further stated “I’m not the person that was robbed. I had nothing to do with that.” In the text exchange Taylor insisted that his only involvement was that he bought drugs off Niall Long. He also texted “they’re trying to put me in the mix.” The jurors also heard evidence from Sgt Maurice O’Connor. He said that Niall Long had sent a text message to his mother Janice Long on 2 September 2023. She texted him saying that her jeep smelled of Dettol. Sgt O’Connor said that Long texted his mother. In his reply he stated that the boot of the car was cleaned because “the fella that robbed me got a hiding and was thrown in the boot after.” To embed this post, copy the code below on your site 600px wide <iframe width="600" height="460" frameborder="0" style="border:0px;" src="https://www.thejournal.ie/https://www.thejournal.ie/second-man-found-guilty-of-murdering-kieran-quilligan-in-cork-6854440-Oct2025/?embedpost=6854440&width=600&height=460" ></iframe> 400px wide <iframe width="600" height="460" frameborder="0" style="border:0px;" src="https://www.thejournal.ie/https://www.thejournal.ie/second-man-found-guilty-of-murdering-kieran-quilligan-in-cork-6854440-Oct2025/?embedpost=6854440&width=400&height=460" ></iframe> 300px wide <iframe width="600" height="460" frameborder="0" style="border:0px;" src="https://www.thejournal.ie/https://www.thejournal.ie/second-man-found-guilty-of-murdering-kieran-quilligan-in-cork-6854440-Oct2025/?embedpost=6854440&width=300&height=460" ></iframe> Create an email alert based on the current article

A second man has been found guilty of the murder of a man who was bludgeoned to death and dumped in scrub land following a row over the robbery and theft of drugs and cash in Cork City. Luke Taylor (27), formerly of Cherry Lawn, Blackrock, Cork, had denied the murder of Kieran Quilligan (47) on a date unknown between September 1st, 2023, and January 29th, 2024, when he was arraigned at the Central Criminal Court sitting in Cork earlier this month. On Friday afternoon, the jury of 10 men and two women returned after five hours and 44 minutes of deliberations and found Taylor guilty of the murder of Mr Quilligan, whose skeletal remains were found five months after he was murdered by Taylor and co-accused Niall Long. Ms Justice Siobhan Lankford remanded both Taylor and Long, formerly of St Michael’s Close, Mahon, Cork, in custody for sentence on October 29th when the court will hear victim impact statements from the Quiligan family. Long was convicted on Thursday of the murder. During the trial, the jury heard Mr Quilligan’s murder had its origins in an incident where he and another man robbed Long of drugs and cash in Cork City on September 1st, 2023. Mr Quilligan disappeared later that day. The deceased man’s partner Colette O’Driscoll said the last time she saw her partner was when he left their apartment at Riverview on Anderson’s Quay in Cork City centre, accompanied by Taylor, shortly before 9pm on the night of September 1st, 2023. When he failed to return home, she reported him missing to An Garda Síochána three days later on September 4th. She said she reported Mr Quilligan’s disappearance because she was starting to hear rumours. When she met Luke Taylor in town some days later he said he didn’t know what happened to Mr Quilligan, as he had left him at Morrison’s Island on September 1st. The jury heard gardaí tracked Mr Quilligan on CCTV walking with Taylor up the quays in Cork City to St Finbar’s Place. He went up some steps near St Fin Barre’s Cathedral but there was no sign of him ever emerging at the top of the steps on to Fort Street. They heard evidence a white Toyota Rav 4, registered to Long’s mother Janice, was seen entering Fort Street and reversing into the steps at the top of St Finbarr’s Place. It left the area and drove to Little Island in east Cork. They were shown CCTV footage of the same vehicle calling to the Rochestown Park Hotel in Cork on September 4th, where Taylor got in.It again headed towards Rostellan in east Cork where Mr Quilligan’s skeletal remains were found on January 29th, 2024. Assistant State Pathologist Dr Margot Bolster said she was unable to say exactly when Mr Quilligan had died or give a precise cause of death, due to the length of time between his death and the postmortem which had resulted in the decay and disappearance of all soft tissue and organs. Dr Bolster said it was clear Mr Quilligan had been the victim of a serious assault, as he had suffered numerous injuries, including fractures of the temporal bone, parietal bone and mandible or jawbone in the head as well as fractures to several ribs, leg bones and hand bones. She said several of the fractures suggested a blow with a blunt instrument like a hammer. Dr Sarah Fleming of Forensic Science Ireland said blood stains found in the boot of the Toyota Rav 4 provided a DNA match with Mr Quilligan.

A second man has been found guilty of the murder of a 47-year-old man whose remains were found in a jute bag in a ravine in Whitewell, Rostellan, in Cork, last year. Luke Taylor, aged 27, with an address at Cherry Lawn, Blackrock, in Cork, was found guilty by a jury this morning. His co-accused, 33-year-old Niall Long, formerly of St Michael's Close, in Mahon, in Cork, was yesterday also found guilty of the murder of Kieran Quilligan. Mr Quilligan, 47, from Togher in Cork, was last seen alive on 1 September 2023. He was missing for five months when his remains were discovered on 29 January 2024, after gardaí brought a cadaver dog to search an area of scrubland. The Central Criminal Court sitting in Cork heard that he had been beaten with a hammer like weapon. Mr Quilligan suffered multiple bone fractures. However, an exact cause of death could not be determined because of the decomposition of the body. Both men now face mandatory life sentences and were remanded in custody for sentencing on 29 October. In his closing speech to the jury, prosecution senior counsel Donal O'Sullivan said that Mr Quilligan was "lured" to his death. He stated that Taylor brought him to a laneway at St Finbarr's Place in Cork city on 1 September 2023 where he and Long "ambushed" him. Mr O'Sullivan said that the men then threw Mr Quilligan in to the boot of a car. He said that the "instigating factor" in relation to what occurred involved Mr Quilligan stealing drugs from Long earlier that day. © RTÉ 2025.

Title: JPMorgan Chase to start accepting Bitcoin, Ethereum as loan collateral: report
URL: https://coinjournal.net/news/jpmorgan-chase-to-start-accepting-bitcoin-ethereum-as-loan-collateral-report/
Time Published: 2025-10-24T11:02:30Z

JPMorgan Chase & Co. is reportedly preparing to let institutional clients use BTC and ETH as collateral for loans by the end of the year, as per a Bloomberg report. The move marks one of the most significant steps yet by a major US bank toward integrating digital assets into traditional finance, signalling how fast cryptocurrencies are moving from the periphery to the core of global banking. For years, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon was one of the fiercest critics of Bitcoin, calling it a “decentralised Ponzi scheme” and claiming that only criminals used it. Dimon’s comments often shaped how Wall Street viewed the cryptocurrency market. But Dimon’s tone has softened in recent years, especially since Donald Trump’s 2024 election win, which brought regulatory changes that have made it easier for banks to engage with digital assets. Now, Dimon’s JPMorgan is taking a major step that would have seemed unthinkable just a few years ago. The bank’s new program will reportedly allow institutional clients to pledge their Bitcoin and Ethereum holdings as collateral for loans. The assets will be held by a third-party custodian, ensuring compliance with existing financial and regulatory standards. Speculation about JPMorgan’s crypto-collateral plans first emerged earlier this year when the Financial Times reported that the bank was exploring such a move, potentially by 2026. At the time, scepticism ran high. Dimon’s long record of dismissing Bitcoin, combined with banks’ cautious approach to regulatory uncertainty, made the plan seem remote. However, the landscape has changed rapidly in 2025. With Bitcoin trading above $111,000 and Ethereum nearing $4,000, the digital asset market has reached unprecedented maturity and capitalisation. Bitcoin’s market cap has surged to over $2.2 trillion, while Ethereum’s market cap has climbed to nearly $478 billion. The rise in these asset prices, combined with increased institutional demand, has made cryptocurrencies more appealing as loan collateral. JPMorgan’s initiative will expand on its earlier decision to accept crypto-linked exchange-traded funds (ETFs) as collateral. JPMorgan’s shift mirrors a broader transformation across the financial sector. Morgan Stanley plans to open cryptocurrency access to retail investors through its E*Trade platform in the first half of next year. State Street, BNY Mellon, and Fidelity are all expanding their digital asset custody services, while BlackRock recently introduced new mechanisms allowing investors to convert Bitcoin directly into ETF holdings. Even long-time sceptics like Standard Chartered have revised their stance, recognising the growing importance of cryptocurrencies in global finance. These moves indicate that digital assets are no longer being viewed as speculative outliers but as legitimate components of diversified financial systems.

Title: DAS London 2025: Keep Calm And Carry On Trading Crypto
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/lawrencewintermeyer/2025/10/24/das-london-2025-keep-calm-and-carry-on-trading-crypto/

ByLawrence Wintermeyer, Contributor. The autumn conference season in the U.K. continued last week with Blockwork’s Digital Asset Summit (DAS) London 2025 leaving its indelible mark on the city. With over 150 speakers, 2,500 attendees, 45 sessions, the three-day summit is at the crossroads of TradFi and Defi and focused on topics like institutional crypto adoption, ETFs, tokenization, stablecoins, and regulatory frameworks. It was a suit with no tie meets hoodies event with no dinosaurs. Speakers included a blend of TradFi and DeFi rockstars including, Matt Kunke – Blackrock, Mathew McDermott - Goldman Sachs, Jeffrey Kendrick - Standard Chartered, Danny Masters - Coinshares, Simon Taylor - Tempo, Catherine Chen – Binance, Chuck Mounts – S&P Global, Mark Jennings – Gemini, Laura Navaratnam – Crypto Council for Innovation, Dan Morehead – Pantera, Sandy Kaul – Templeton, Mara Schmiedt - Alluvial, Dave Cunningham – Citi, Samantha Bohbot - RockawayX, Victor Jung – Hamilton Lane, Ryan Hayward - Barclays , Peter Left – Lloyds, Matt Hougan – Bitwise, Antaoly Crachilov – Nickel, Chris Tyrer – Bullish, Baron Holmes of Richmond - U.K. House of Lords, and many more HERE. Nigel Farage, U.K, Reform MP, was the keynote politco speaker and claims he was on his best behavior meeting the Governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, a few weeks ago and chimed in on the bank’s proposed individual stablecoin limits, making the point that limits were not required and only referring to Bailey as a dinosaur once during the meeting. DAS London’s big takeaway was, “The integration is further deepening at the crossroads of TradFi and DeFi.” Mark Jennings, Gemini's head of Europe, said, “DAS has shown that the demand is there to integrate digital assets into traditional finance, whether that's holding bitcoin in their treasuries, trading derivatives or accessing DATs. “This is certainly fueled by the regulatory clarity from the first pro-crypto U.S. Administration, the implementation of MiCA in Europe, and the regulatory roadmap outlined by the U.K. government in their ambitions to become a global crypto hub. The big talk at the summit was of the previous Friday’s crypto flash crash where over $19 billion in leveraged positions were wiped out within hours. The liquidations were nine times larger than any previous single-day total, marking the largest deleveraging in market history. Insights VC notes bitcoin fell about 14% from $122,000 to $105,000 and Ether dropped 12% to $3,436. Major altcoins saw extreme intraday losses with Solana falling over 40% at one point, Toncoin briefly trading at $0.50 (−80%), and Worldcoin loosing 70% of its value before partial rebounds. Uber analyst, Blockworks Byron Gilliam in his daily mail The Breakdown, elegantly walked us through “auto-deleveraging” (ADL), when leveraged crypto options or “perps” on the wrong side of the trade unwind at such a velocity, margin rapidly deteriorates, and liquidity dries up resulting in ADL liquidating positions on the right side of the trade. Notes Gilliam, “Sometimes, however, no one has any margin left, so there’s no one to sell a losing position to. In that case, the only thing left to do is close the seller’s bet as well, because the game is over, for everyone. Closing a winning bet is called “auto-deleveraging” (ADL) and it’s what caused nearly all of crypto to crash on Friday. “You and I are not the only ones who had never heard of it [ADL] before then. ADL is a way of kicking people off the perps market” and refers to Doug Colkitt’s comments to Empire, “It happens infrequently enough that even seasoned perps traders are often barely aware of it.” The pithy Gilliam quotes Gordon Gekko on markets, “It’s a zero-sum game. Somebody wins, somebody loses. Money isn’t lost or made, it’s simply transferred.” Arguably, with ADL kicking in, everyone is a loser. On a positive note, by the start of DAS on Monday, many crypto prices were recovering with bitcoin hitting $115,000 and finding support around $110,000 for the week. Anatoly Crachilov, CEO and founder of the crypto fund Nickel Digital Asset Management, noted in his DAS panel that his fund endured the market stress event quite well and even ended the weekend positive. “I think this reflects the important saturation of the industry where more and more sophisticated pod shops like Nickel will enter the crypto market and the market structure will mature significantly, said Felix Jauvlin, on The Breakdown daily mail, filling in for Gilliam. While a number of centralized crypto exchanges experienced outages and delays, Hyperliquid, an on-chain perp DEX, saw over $10 billion of positions force-closed, the highest of any venue, as its transparent on-chain engine liquidated positions to avoid any bad debt, triggering its first ADL event in over two years. Adds Jennings, “Whilst DAS’s timing was shortly after the market downturn experienced on Friday, volatility is one aspect that comes along with the crypto market, bringing both opportunity and risk for investors. “Nevertheless, reliability is a key function that builds trust on centralized exchanges, and we have many guardrails in place to ensure we can offer the same market execution and functionality that our customers depend on, regardless of market conditions, which is what institutions expect.” Elise Soucie, executive director of Global Digital Finance, called in her analysis of the crypto crash to the Bloomberg Opening Trade from DC Fintech Week, “This is not actually a crypto specific event, it is a policy-induced crypto liquidation cascade in a market already nervous about the dollar, interest rates, the private credit market, and the deficit.” Soucie notes that it was not until Trump’s Truth social posts on Chinese tariffs at 4:30 in the afternoon on Friday that the crypto market, which was already selling off and in decline on Friday, went into a liquidation cascade. The crypto crash was as big a discussion focal point during DC Fintech Week as it was at DAS London, especially in the policy community - market analysts and traders should take note, with crypto trading 24/7/365, it looks like the new canary in the coal mine for headlines for market reactions to emerging policy and macroeconomic uncertainty. Crypto market infrastructure builders now have their head buried in work, as always after a volatile event with unintended consequences, and are focused on building the next generation of market circuit breakers and liquidity lifelines to avoid the future ADL of positions that are in the money. Nothing exemplifies the TradFi DeFi crossroads as well as the strategic partnership announced between S&P and Chainlink to deliver S&Ps Stablecoin Stability Assessments (SSAs) on-chain. Chuck Mounts, chief DeFi officer at S&P Global said, "The launch of SSAs on-chain through Chainlink underscores our commitment to meeting our clients where they are. The collaboration provides real-time access to S&P’s comprehensive stablecoin evaluations, enhancing transparency and empowering investors with critical data within the evolving digital asset landscape. And how cool is it that financial institutions like S&P have a chief DeFi officer. Adds Mounts, "By making our SSAs available on-chain through Chainlink's proven oracle infrastructure, we're enabling market participants to access our assessments seamlessly using their existing DeFi infrastructure, enhancing transparency and informed decision-making across the DeFi landscape." Samantha Bohbot, partner and chief growth officer at RockwayX highlights, “Last week’s DAS conference highlighted what many industry insiders have known for quite some time: this cycle was marked by institutional adoption. This was underscored by the event’s attendees and topics of discussion. “Clear areas of industry growth were highlighted; for example, liquidity in on-chain private markets, but now that the industry is gaining institutional attention, there needs to be a shift towards further innovation. “Blockchain’s advantages for traditional finance have yet to be fully realized. One area that has drawn institutional interest is tokenization, and yet so far, tokenization has been simply taking what was there and putting it on-chain. The next cycle will be dictated by structured products that are blockchain native and uniquely on-chain, rather than copy and paste.” Mara Schmiedt, co-founder and ceo of Alluvial says, “RWA tokenization was a key DAS theme and discussion topic with issuer-led demand, institutional infrastructure readiness and regulatory clarity improving, Larry Fink's “tokenization as the future of financial markets” feels more real and tangible now. “DATs (Digital Asset Treasuries) were another subject of debate after amassing billions of dillars in the first half of this year, as public companies and treasurers pivot away from passive BTC holdings towards productive and stakeable assets including ETH, SOL and others. “Tons of chatter around Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs) as a new form of yield-bearing collateral supporting DeFi money legos and as a viable liquidity solution for ETFs given expanding ETH staking queues and with staking-enabled ETFs in the US (Grayscale leading) hitting the market this month.” Danny Masters, chairman of Coinshares, a European crypto ETP pioneer, had a message about its recent U.S. public markets debut that European markets should pay attention to: European markets under-value digital assets public companies. Masters didn’t move Coinshares to the U.S. market to raise money in the capital markets but rather to focus on achieving market multiples as high as 25x achieved by companies Coinshare’s U.S. peer group, versus 2x in Europe. Masters is a poster child for the TradFi DeFi crossroads, like many former Tier 1 Wall Street traders who bring their capital markets experience to crypto to strengthen market conduct and deploy their own time and capital founding innovative businesses. At one of my Association dinners a few years back, Masters told the story of how his then European-based regulated investment management business dealing in crypto was being persecuted by a European regulator. In trying to do the right thing and work with regulators he was also personally persecuted – no respect. It is easy to understand the popularity of the U.S. Administration’s approach and why European fintech firms are flocking to the U.S. – you are a digital innovation hero in the US - respect. The final day three of DAS closed with a panel on Goldman Sachs play book with a perennial London conference favorite, Mathew McDermott, Goldman Sachs digital assets czar, in a fireside chat with Blockworks with Blockwork’s Michael Ippolito. No grey hair on this youthful 20-year GS veteran who looks like he could be starring in a Hollywood movie about Wall Street’s digital space race. McDermott points to the rise in stablecoins and tokenized money market funds that will drive greater collateral mobility, a killer app if not the holy grail in the TradFi and derivatives space. Watch the full panel session HERE. The final word goes to Lord Holmes, Baron Holmes of Richmond, MBE, the U.K.s digital champion in the House of Lords (U.K Upper House of Parliament). He could not have summarized DAS London 2025 better. "There's been great conversations at DAS and that's what we need more of,” said Holmes, “more conversations, connections, and public engagement for this digital asset space." My only disappointment with DAS London 2025 was not meeting Byron Gilliam, he didn’t make it to London - I was even wearing my Hermes tie! I’ll keep my fingers crossed for DAS NYC 2026.

Title: JPMorgan Opens Door to Bitcoin and Ethereum Collateral for Institutional Clients

Written & Edited byKamina Bashir JPMorgan, an American multinational investment bank and financial services company, will allow its institutional clients to use Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) as loan collateral by the end of 2025. This move marks one of the most significant steps yet by a major traditional bank toward integrating digital assets into mainstream finance, reflecting growing confidence in cryptocurrencies as legitimate financial instruments. Bloomberg revealed that the program will be offered globally and will rely on third-party custodians to securely hold the pledged crypto assets. Notably, in July, BeInCrypto reported that such an initiative was under consideration. At that time, sources suggested the bank might begin offering crypto-backed loans sometime next year. However, the latest update indicates that the launch could now happen by the end of this year. The latest pivot builds on JPMorgan’s earlier step of accepting crypto-linked exchange-traded funds (ETFs) as collateral. The bank first began offering financing against BlackRock Inc.’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), marking its initial step toward integrating digital assets into its lending operations. This comes even as CEO Jamie Dimon’s personal views on crypto remain cautious. In 2023, Dimon described Bitcoin as a “hyped-up fraud” and even referred to it as a “pet rock.” That December, he doubled down on his criticism, saying he was “deeply opposed to crypto and Bitcoin.” “We are going to have some kind of digital currency at some point. I’m not against crypto. You know, Bitcoin itself has no intrinsic value. It’s used heavily by sex traffickers, money launderers, ransomware,” Dimon said in an interview in January 2025. Nevertheless, the latest initiatives reflect that the bank is adopting a more pragmatic approach. In May, it began allowing clients to purchase Bitcoin. The bank also introduced its own alternative to a stablecoin — the J.P. Morgan Deposit Token (JPMD). This token operates on Base. “JPMD represents the first product to be offered by J.P. Morgan on public blockchain infrastructure, and will provide institutional clients a digital money alternative to stablecoins,” the bank noted. Furthermore, JPMorgan’s blockchain network, Kinexys, has experienced significant expansion, with its average daily transaction volume surpassing $2 billion. During Q3 2025, Kinexys broadened its presence across carbon markets, supply-chain finance, and cross-border payments. This highlighted the bank’s goal of making blockchain infrastructure a core element of institutional settlement. JPMorgan is also among the 30 global banks participating in SWIFT’s initiative to create a shared digital ledger. It is designed to facilitate real-time, cross-border payments.

Title: AI chip challenger Groq eyes APAC expansion

BAIVECTOR - AdobeStock US startup Groq has been challenging semiconductor powerhouses Nvidia and AMD in the artificial intelligence (AI) chip race with a novel chip architecture that can perform inferencing tasks at breakneck speeds. Unlike graphics processing units (GPUs), which have become the industry standard for both AI training and inferencing, Groq’s chips – dubbed language processing units (LPUs) – are built specifically for inference, the process of running a trained AI model to get a response. But while GPUs rely on external memory to store the AI model, making them prone to performance bottlenecks, Groq’s system distributes AI models across thousands of chips, storing them directly in faster, on-chip memory with lower latency and higher energy efficiency. Groq CEO Jonathan Ross, a former Google engineer who worked on the cloud provider’s tensor processing unit (TPU), likened the company’s chip architecture to a ballet performance. “It’s like a ballet choreography, where everyone just knows where to be,” Ross told Computer Weekly during a trip to Singapore. “Our chips know when to accept the data,” he said. GPU systems, on the other hand, are unpredictable, added Ross, comparing them to showing up for an unscheduled meeting and having to wait. Groq’s focus on inference workloads was deliberate. “We weren’t going to make customers’ lives better by working on training, which is too expensive, uses too much energy, and requires too much effort to get the software stack to work, but inference was not a solved problem,” he said, adding that it’s also a much bigger problem with 10 to 20 times more compute being deployed for inferencing compared with training workloads. During a demonstration, Ross showed how an AI model running on the company’s LPUs generated a complex, multi-day travel itinerary in the blink of an eye from a voice prompt, responding to a flurry of edits and requests almost instantaneously. “We’re dramatically faster than GPUs,” he said. “Normally, people have to put a lot of work into streaming the audio. We actually generate the entire audio and then start playing. That’s how fast it is.” Groq’s compiler was designed before the chip, allowing it to onboard some of the largest AI models much faster than others. Ross said a trillion-parameter model was up and running in production on a Monday after it was released on a Friday. “We actually spent less time compiling it than downloading it,” he quipped. And, with large AI models running faster and more efficiently, Ross believes there will be less need to use smaller models or fine-tune a large model, which could be quickly superseded by a newer foundation model that performs just as well. “It has become largely about getting one of the larger models to run as inexpensively and as fast as possible, which is what we do,” he said. Groq’s work to speed up inferencing has attracted a developer following in the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region, where there are 45,000 registered developers on Groq’s platform in Singapore alone, with India having the second-highest number of developers globally. The company, which was founded in 2016, also claimed that usage of its application programming interface (API) increased from 17% to 36% in the past year, surpassing Amazon’s, citing a recent industry survey. To meet the rising demand for its chips and the GroqCloud service, the startup has expanded from one datacentre to 13 in the past 12 months. It is now planning to open its first datacentre in APAC later this year. While datacentre operators continue to grapple with the power and cooling demand of AI workloads, Groq’s air-cooled chips can be deployed in older facilities that don’t support the liquid-cooling requirements of power-hungry GPUs. “In Finland, Microsoft was moving out of an Equinix datacentre that’s air-cooled because it’s useless to them, and as they moved out, we moved in,” said Ross. “There’s an enormous amount of air-cooled datacentre space that others can’t use because GPUs have to be liquid-cooled.” The company also lets organisations with data sovereignty and security requirements deploy its chips on-premise through partnerships with datacentre hardware suppliers. On-premise customers can get their own custom region, and also use GroqCloud if they require more capacity than they bought, he said. Groq’s growth has been fuelled by strong financial backing from key investors. In September 2025, it raised $750m in a Series E funding round led by Disruptive, with participation from major investors like BlackRock, Samsung and Cisco, valuing the firm at $6.9bn.

Title: Bitcoin was the LIFELINE TEN YEARS AGO to counter economic damage caused by governments and big banks

This isnât hypothetical. Itâs the reality for millions of young Australians, Americans, and Westerners under 40 who watched Bitcoin climb from $400 to over $100,000 while they were told to trust the same institutions that inflated housing prices beyond reason. The question isnât just about missed opportunities anymore. Itâs about whether an entire generation will ever recover from a financial betrayal orchestrated by central banks, corrupt politicians, and a rigged real estate marketâor if cryptocurrency, despite its risks, remains their only lifeline. Now, as governments scramble to regulate crypto, the same forces that locked young people out of homeownership are positioning themselves to control the one asset that could set them free. The irony is brutal. The system that failed them now wants to dictate how they use their last escape route. Key points: A decade of theft: Younger generations were sold the lie that student debt, low wages, and skyrocketing home prices were just "market realities"âwhile Bitcoin, dismissed as a gamble, surged 23,000% in the same period. The housing trap: Australia ranks as the sixth most expensive property market globally, with millennials and Gen Z now viewing crypto as their only shot at financial independence. Regulation as a double-edged sword: While proper oversight could legitimize crypto, history shows governments use "protections" to seize controlâjust as they did with fiat currency, stocks, and real estate. The surveillance trade-off: A staggering 33% of Gen Z would accept government surveillance in their homes, revealing a dangerous naivety about how financial control leads to totalitarian overreach. The Bitcoin awakening: Younger investors are shifting from stocks to crypto, but will they recognize the deeper gameâwhere banks and states manipulate every asset class to keep them dependent? How Big Banks and Big Government stole the dream For decades, the script was simple: go to college, get a job, buy a house, retire comfortably. But somewhere between the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-era money printing, the script was rewrittenâwithout telling the actors. Central banks slashed interest rates to near-zero, inflating asset bubbles that only the already-wealthy could access. Wages stagnated while corporate landlords and BlackRock snapped up single-family homes to turn them into rental cash cows. The result? In Australia, 40% of under-35s now say their biggest financial regret isnât splurging on avocado toastâitâs ignoring Bitcoin when it was cheaper than a used car. The numbers donât lie. In 2015, Bitcoin traded between $172 and $465. Today, it hovers around $107,000. A $1,000 investment then would be worth over $2.3 million now. Meanwhile, the median home price in Sydney has surged past $1.4 million, with wages failing to keep pace. The message to young people is clear: the traditional paths to wealth are closed. The only question left is whether theyâll let the system close the alternatives, too. Swyftxâs survey reveals the desperation. Eighty percent of Australians under 50 regret their financial decisions over the past decade. Crypto isnât just an investment for them; itâs a rebellion. "Housing unaffordability at this scale is a predicament other generations didnât face," a Swyftx spokesperson told Cointelegraph. "Crypto is seen as an opportunity to get ahead." But hereâs the catch: the same institutions that priced them out of homes are now moving to regulateâand potentially strangleâcrypto. Australiaâs Labor Party has already proposed folding crypto exchanges under existing financial laws. On the surface, this sounds like "protection." In reality, itâs the first step toward co-opting the one asset young people still control. The surveillance stateâs endgame Thereâs a disturbing paradox in the data. While younger generations flock to crypto as a hedge against a broken system, a third of Gen Z would willingly invite government surveillance into their homesâostensibly to "monitor domestic violence." This isnât just ignorance; itâs a failure to recognize how financial control morphs into total control. History shows that once governments gain a foothold in monitoring assets, they rarely stop there. Look at Canadaâs 2022 trucker protests, where Prime Minister Justin Trudeau froze protestersâ bank accounts without due process. Or the U.S. IRSâs push to track transactions over $600, a move that would give the state real-time visibility into every citizenâs spending. Crypto was supposed to be the exit ramp from this kind of overreach. But if young investors donât wake up to the patternsâhow fiat currency became a tool of debt enslavement, how stocks are manipulated by hedge funds, how real estate is hoarded by institutional buyersâtheyâll watch crypto suffer the same fate. The warning signs are already here. The Biden administrationâs 2021 infrastructure bill included crypto tax reporting requirements so onerous that even The Wall Street Journal called them unworkable. The European Unionâs MiCA regulations, while less draconian, still impose KYC (Know Your Customer) rules that erode privacy. And letâs not forget the World Economic Forumâs gleeful predictions of a cashless society where "you will own nothing and be happy." Cryptoâs original promise was decentralization. But if Gen Z trades financial freedom for the false security of government "protections," theyâll repeat the same mistakes their parents madeâtrusting the very system thatâs fleecing them. The Bitcoin regulation reckoning The shift is happening. Swyftxâs data shows that within two years, younger Australians may be just as likely to buy Bitcoin as traditional stocks. But momentum depends on two things: regulation and education. The first is a double-edged sword. Yes, clear rules could bring institutional money into crypto, stabilizing prices and reducing volatility. But as weâve seen with every other asset class, regulation is a Trojan horse. Banks didnât enter the crypto space out of altruism; they did it to co-opt the competition. Morgan Stanley now offers Bitcoin exposure to its wealthy clientsânot because it believes in decentralization, but because it wants to profit from the revolution it once dismissed. The second factorâeducationâis where the battle will be won or lost. Younger generations understand the basics of crypto, but do they grasp the deeper game? Do they know that the Federal Reserveâs money-printing binges devalue their savings? Do they realize that the same politicians pushing "affordable housing" policies are often the ones taking donations from BlackRock and real estate lobbyists? Do they see the connection between central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and Chinaâs social credit system, where dissenters can have their funds frozen with a keystroke? The answers will determine whether crypto remains a tool of liberation or becomes just another cog in the machine. Right now, the signs are mixed. On one hand, you have Gen Z traders making nearly $10,000 in profits on averageâproof that theyâre learning to navigate the space. On the other, you have a generation thatâs disturbingly comfortable with surveillance, seemingly unaware that financial privacy and personal freedom are inseparable. The housing crisis wasnât an accident. It was the result of deliberate policies. Crypto offered an escape hatch, but the window is closing. Governments and banks are circling, ready to turn Bitcoin into just another regulated, taxed, and surveilled asset. The question for millennials and Gen Z is no longer about whether to invest. Itâs about whether theyâll fight to keep crypto freeâor hand the keys to the same institutions that stole their future in the first place.

Sources include: CoinTelegraph.com CoinTelegraph.com Enoch, Brighteon.ai Key points: A decade of theft: Younger generations were sold the lie that student debt, low wages, and skyrocketing home prices were just "market realities"âwhile Bitcoin, dismissed as a gamble, surged 23,000% in the same period. The housing trap: Australia ranks as the sixth most expensive property market globally, with millennials and Gen Z now viewing crypto as their only shot at financial independence. Regulation as a double-edged sword: While proper oversight could legitimize crypto, history shows governments use "protections" to seize controlâjust as they did with fiat currency, stocks, and real estate. The surveillance trade-off: A staggering 33% of Gen Z would accept government surveillance in their homes, revealing a dangerous naivety about how financial control leads to totalitarian overreach. The Bitcoin awakening: Younger investors are shifting from stocks to crypto, but will they recognize the deeper gameâwhere banks and states manipulate every asset class to keep them dependent? How Big Banks and Big Government stole the dream For decades, the script was simple: go to college, get a job, buy a house, retire comfortably. But somewhere between the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-era money printing, the script was rewrittenâwithout telling the actors. Central banks slashed interest rates to near-zero, inflating asset bubbles that only the already-wealthy could access. Wages stagnated while corporate landlords and BlackRock snapped up single-family homes to turn them into rental cash cows. The result? In Australia, 40% of under-35s now say their biggest financial regret isnât splurging on avocado toastâitâs ignoring Bitcoin when it was cheaper than a used car. The numbers donât lie. In 2015, Bitcoin traded between $172 and $465. Today, it hovers around $107,000. A $1,000 investment then would be worth over $2.3 million now. Meanwhile, the median home price in Sydney has surged past $1.4 million, with wages failing to keep pace. The message to young people is clear: the traditional paths to wealth are closed. The only question left is whether theyâll let the system close the alternatives, too. Swyftxâs survey reveals the desperation. Eighty percent of Australians under 50 regret their financial decisions over the past decade. Crypto isnât just an investment for them; itâs a rebellion. "Housing unaffordability at this scale is a predicament other generations didnât face," a Swyftx spokesperson told Cointelegraph. "Crypto is seen as an opportunity to get ahead." But hereâs the catch: the same institutions that priced them out of homes are now moving to regulateâand potentially strangleâcrypto. Australiaâs Labor Party has already proposed folding crypto exchanges under existing financial laws. On the surface, this sounds like "protection." In reality, itâs the first step toward co-opting the one asset young people still control. The surveillance stateâs endgame Thereâs a disturbing paradox in the data. While younger generations flock to crypto as a hedge against a broken system, a third of Gen Z would willingly invite government surveillance into their homesâostensibly to "monitor domestic violence." This isnât just ignorance; itâs a failure to recognize how financial control morphs into total control. History shows that once governments gain a foothold in monitoring assets, they rarely stop there. Look at Canadaâs 2022 trucker protests, where Prime Minister Justin Trudeau froze protestersâ bank accounts without due process. Or the U.S. IRSâs push to track transactions over $600, a move that would give the state real-time visibility into every citizenâs spending. Crypto was supposed to be the exit ramp from this kind of overreach. But if young investors donât wake up to the patternsâhow fiat currency became a tool of debt enslavement, how stocks are manipulated by hedge funds, how real estate is hoarded by institutional buyersâtheyâll watch crypto suffer the same fate. The warning signs are already here. The Biden administrationâs 2021 infrastructure bill included crypto tax reporting requirements so onerous that even The Wall Street Journal called them unworkable. The European Unionâs MiCA regulations, while less draconian, still impose KYC (Know Your Customer) rules that erode privacy. And letâs not forget the World Economic Forumâs gleeful predictions of a cashless society where "you will own nothing and be happy." Cryptoâs original promise was decentralization. But if Gen Z trades financial freedom for the false security of government "protections," theyâll repeat the same mistakes their parents madeâtrusting the very system thatâs fleecing them. The Bitcoin regulation reckoning The shift is happening. Swyftxâs data shows that within two years, younger Australians may be just as likely to buy Bitcoin as traditional stocks. But momentum depends on two things: regulation and education. The first is a double-edged sword. Yes, clear rules could bring institutional money into crypto, stabilizing prices and reducing volatility. But as weâve seen with every other asset class, regulation is a Trojan horse. Banks didnât enter the crypto space out of altruism; they did it to co-opt the competition. Morgan Stanley now offers Bitcoin exposure to its wealthy clientsânot because it believes in decentralization, but because it wants to profit from the revolution it once dismissed. The second factorâeducationâis where the battle will be won or lost. Younger generations understand the basics of crypto, but do they grasp the deeper game? Do they know that the Federal Reserveâs money-printing binges devalue their savings? Do they realize that the same politicians pushing "affordable housing" policies are often the ones taking donations from BlackRock and real estate lobbyists? Do they see the connection between central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and Chinaâs social credit system, where dissenters can have their funds frozen with a keystroke? The answers will determine whether crypto remains a tool of liberation or becomes just another cog in the machine. Right now, the signs are mixed. On one hand, you have Gen Z traders making nearly $10,000 in profits on averageâproof that theyâre learning to navigate the space. On the other, you have a generation thatâs disturbingly comfortable with surveillance, seemingly unaware that financial privacy and personal freedom are inseparable. The housing crisis wasnât an accident. It was the result of deliberate policies. Crypto offered an escape hatch, but the window is closing. Governments and banks are circling, ready to turn Bitcoin into just another regulated, taxed, and surveilled asset. The question for millennials and Gen Z is no longer about whether to invest.

Morgan Stanley now offers Bitcoin exposure to its wealthy clientsânot because it believes in decentralization, but because it wants to profit from the revolution it once dismissed. The second factorâeducationâis where the battle will be won or lost. Younger generations understand the basics of crypto, but do they grasp the deeper game? Do they know that the Federal Reserveâs money-printing binges devalue their savings? Do they realize that the same politicians pushing "affordable housing" policies are often the ones taking donations from BlackRock and real estate lobbyists? Do they see the connection between central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and Chinaâs social credit system, where dissenters can have their funds frozen with a keystroke? The answers will determine whether crypto remains a tool of liberation or becomes just another cog in the machine. Right now, the signs are mixed. On one hand, you have Gen Z traders making nearly $10,000 in profits on averageâproof that theyâre learning to navigate the space. On the other, you have a generation thatâs disturbingly comfortable with surveillance, seemingly unaware that financial privacy and personal freedom are inseparable. The housing crisis wasnât an accident. It was the result of deliberate policies. Crypto offered an escape hatch, but the window is closing. Governments and banks are circling, ready to turn Bitcoin into just another regulated, taxed, and surveilled asset. The question for millennials and Gen Z is no longer about whether to invest. Itâs about whether theyâll fight to keep crypto freeâor hand the keys to the same institutions that stole their future in the first place.

A $1,000 investment then would be worth over $2.3 million now. Meanwhile, the median home price in Sydney has surged past $1.4 million, with wages failing to keep pace. The message to young people is clear: the traditional paths to wealth are closed. The only question left is whether theyâll let the system close the alternatives, too. Swyftxâs survey reveals the desperation. Eighty percent of Australians under 50 regret their financial decisions over the past decade. Crypto isnât just an investment for them; itâs a rebellion. "Housing unaffordability at this scale is a predicament other generations didnât face," a Swyftx spokesperson told Cointelegraph. "Crypto is seen as an opportunity to get ahead." But hereâs the catch: the same institutions that priced them out of homes are now moving to regulateâand potentially strangleâcrypto. Australiaâs Labor Party has already proposed folding crypto exchanges under existing financial laws. On the surface, this sounds like "protection." In reality, itâs the first step toward co-opting the one asset young people still control. The surveillance stateâs endgame Thereâs a disturbing paradox in the data. While younger generations flock to crypto as a hedge against a broken system, a third of Gen Z would willingly invite government surveillance into their homesâostensibly to "monitor domestic violence." This isnât just ignorance; itâs a failure to recognize how financial control morphs into total control. History shows that once governments gain a foothold in monitoring assets, they rarely stop there. Look at Canadaâs 2022 trucker protests, where Prime Minister Justin Trudeau froze protestersâ bank accounts without due process. Or the U.S. IRSâs push to track transactions over $600, a move that would give the state real-time visibility into every citizenâs spending. Crypto was supposed to be the exit ramp from this kind of overreach. But if young investors donât wake up to the patternsâhow fiat currency became a tool of debt enslavement, how stocks are manipulated by hedge funds, how real estate is hoarded by institutional buyersâtheyâll watch crypto suffer the same fate. The warning signs are already here. The Biden administrationâs 2021 infrastructure bill included crypto tax reporting requirements so onerous that even The Wall Street Journal called them unworkable. The European Unionâs MiCA regulations, while less draconian, still impose KYC (Know Your Customer) rules that erode privacy. And letâs not forget the World Economic Forumâs gleeful predictions of a cashless society where "you will own nothing and be happy." Cryptoâs original promise was decentralization. But if Gen Z trades financial freedom for the false security of government "protections," theyâll repeat the same mistakes their parents madeâtrusting the very system thatâs fleecing them.

Or the U.S. IRSâs push to track transactions over $600, a move that would give the state real-time visibility into every citizenâs spending. Crypto was supposed to be the exit ramp from this kind of overreach. But if young investors donât wake up to the patternsâhow fiat currency became a tool of debt enslavement, how stocks are manipulated by hedge funds, how real estate is hoarded by institutional buyersâtheyâll watch crypto suffer the same fate. The warning signs are already here. The Biden administrationâs 2021 infrastructure bill included crypto tax reporting requirements so onerous that even The Wall Street Journal called them unworkable. The European Unionâs MiCA regulations, while less draconian, still impose KYC (Know Your Customer) rules that erode privacy. And letâs not forget the World Economic Forumâs gleeful predictions of a cashless society where "you will own nothing and be happy." Cryptoâs original promise was decentralization. But if Gen Z trades financial freedom for the false security of government "protections," theyâll repeat the same mistakes their parents madeâtrusting the very system thatâs fleecing them. The Bitcoin regulation reckoning The shift is happening. Swyftxâs data shows that within two years, younger Australians may be just as likely to buy Bitcoin as traditional stocks. But momentum depends on two things: regulation and education. The first is a double-edged sword. Yes, clear rules could bring institutional money into crypto, stabilizing prices and reducing volatility. But as weâve seen with every other asset class, regulation is a Trojan horse. Banks didnât enter the crypto space out of altruism; they did it to co-opt the competition. Morgan Stanley now offers Bitcoin exposure to its wealthy clientsânot because it believes in decentralization, but because it wants to profit from the revolution it once dismissed. The second factorâeducationâis where the battle will be won or lost. Younger generations understand the basics of crypto, but do they grasp the deeper game? Do they know that the Federal Reserveâs money-printing binges devalue their savings? Do they realize that the same politicians pushing "affordable housing" policies are often the ones taking donations from BlackRock and real estate lobbyists? Do they see the connection between central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and Chinaâs social credit system, where dissenters can have their funds frozen with a keystroke? The answers will determine whether crypto remains a tool of liberation or becomes just another cog in the machine. Right now, the signs are mixed. On one hand, you have Gen Z traders making nearly $10,000 in profits on averageâproof that theyâre learning to navigate the space. On the other, you have a generation thatâs disturbingly comfortable with surveillance, seemingly unaware that financial privacy and personal freedom are inseparable. The housing crisis wasnât an accident. It was the result of deliberate policies. Crypto offered an escape hatch, but the window is closing. Governments and banks are circling, ready to turn Bitcoin into just another regulated, taxed, and surveilled asset. The question for millennials and Gen Z is no longer about whether to invest.

Title: Bitcoin Poised To Top $1.5 Million, Says Ex-PayPal President
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-top-1-5-million-ex-paypal-president/
Time Published: 2025-10-24T00:00:34Z
Full Content:
In a wide-ranging Coin Stories interview published October 21, David Marcus—co-founder and CEO of Lightspark, former president of PayPal and co-creator of Diem, the cryptocurrency project initiated by Facebook—laid out a thesis that Bitcoin will ultimately surpass gold in value and evolve from a purely “store-of-value” asset into the invisible, neutral settlement layer of the internet for money. “I think Bitcoin will be more valuable than gold,” Marcus told host Natalie Brunell. “At today’s gold price, it’s, you know, $1.3 million a bitcoin that [it] will have a higher market cap than gold.” He emphasized he is “decent at directional predictions” but “terrible at timing,” framing the trajectory as inevitable over a five-to-ten-year horizon rather than a near-dated call. The implication of outgrowing gold’s market capitalization places Bitcoin’s potential value well north of $1.3 million per coin and, at Gold’s recent ATH at $4,381.58/oz, above $1.53 million. Marcus’s price view is inseparable from his broader contention that BTC must progress beyond a narrow “digital gold” narrative. Echoing a line from analyst Matt Pines that Brunell cited—“if Bitcoin is only a store of value, it has failed”—Marcus agreed “fully,” but added a critical caveat: the savings-asset phase was a necessary precondition for utility. “We believe that the store-of-value phase is absolutely essential for us to be able to actually build a utility phase of Bitcoin on top of it,” he said, arguing that institutional adoption, ETFs and nation-state accumulation conferred enough legitimacy to begin scaling real-world payments. “Now that every institution… whether it’s BlackRock, Fidelity or others, are actually supporting Bitcoin… we can actually really start building payment utility on top of it.” That utility vision hinges on using Bitcoin more like TCP/IP—an invisible settlement substrate—than as a volatile unit of account for everyday spending. Marcus was blunt about behavioral and economic constraints: “People don’t want to use Bitcoin for everyday purchases because it’s volatile and people want to actually benefit from appreciation… they don’t want to be the Bitcoin pizza guy.” Lightspark’s approach is to move fiat end-to-end while using BTC in the middle. “You can send dollars from a US bank account to someone in Mexico receiving Mexican peso… the settlement asset is Bitcoin in between. So you have dollars, Bitcoin, Mexican peso and it’s invisible to people using it.” Technically, Lightspark is pushing beyond Lightning’s channel model while remaining backward-compatible. Marcus lauded Lightning’s trust model and speed, but highlighted its liquidity and self-custody frictions when scaled to “billions of endpoints.” The company’s newly launched “Spark” is described as a Lightning-compatible, non-channel payment system that enables spinning up “billions of wallets” with “minimal new trust assumptions.” Crucially, he said, it preserves safety valves: “It’s not as trustless as Lightning, but we believe it’s trustless enough and has unilateral exits to Layer 1… you can pull a rip cord and no one can prevent you from recovering your funds on L1.” Marcus also argued that stablecoins—despite their centralized issuer model—are an unavoidable component of global payments, and that anchoring them to BTC’s settlement layer enhances resilience. He described a personal “schizophrenic journey” with stablecoins, disliking the “single throat to choke,” yet accepting their ubiquity and attempting to minimize trust by avoiding separate gas tokens and preserving unilateral exits to Bitcoin L1. On adoption, Marcus pointed to shifting institutional sentiment. Recounting a panel in New York “put together by Citadel Securities,” he said a “majority” of a roughly 450-person room of large traditional-finance investors indicated they own BTC, versus far fewer holding ETH, stablecoins, or any token. “This is a room that traditionally would have been very resistant to Bitcoin… now the times have changed so profoundly.” Yet he still framed retail penetration as early, estimating “low hundreds of millions” of unique holders globally and significant headroom from there. Overall, Marcus’ thesis returns to first principles: BTC as neutral, scarce, programmable collateral and a credibly decentralized settlement layer. Dismissing critiques that it lacks “intrinsic value,” he argued, “Underlying scarcity of Bitcoin secured by code is the intrinsic value… this is the only thing that’s deflationary by nature.” That, he contends, is why Bitcoin should outcompete gold over time: “When the first gold ETFs were launched, they started mining more gold. You can’t do that with Bitcoin.” If and when that market-cap crossover arrives, it would validate the structural call embedded in his remarks—and, by extension, the headline-grabbing notion that BTC’s fair value is not just above seven figures, but ultimately “more valuable than gold,” which today maps to $1.5 million. At press time, BTC traded at $109,060. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email. Jake Simmons has been a Bitcoin enthusiast since 2016.

Title: Crypto M&A surges 30-fold as niche firms shift to mainstream
URL: https://fortune.com/crypto/2025/10/23/crypto-merger-acqusitions-thirty-fold-surge-architect-partners-21shares-falconx/

21shares spent years building its crypto franchise outside Wall Street’s orbit. From Zurich, it launched exchange-traded products that gave European investors access to Bitcoin and Ether long before the U.S. would allow them. Now, in selling itself to FalconX—a crypto prime broker backed by Tiger Global and Singapore’s GIC—the company is trading autonomy for scale as crypto moves closer to the financial mainstream. The deal underscores a broader shift: crypto specialists are entering traditional investment channels through regulated products. And the FalconX-21shares deal is part of a broader surge. Crypto M&A topped $10 billion for the first time in the third quarter, a more than 30-fold increase from a year earlier, according to Architect Partners. For years, crypto was an M&A backwater as it slowly recovered from the 2022 market crash under the glare of hostile regulators. Ten months after Donald Trump returned to the White House and transformed the Securities and Exchange Commission from industry bogeyman to key ally, the tables have turned. Trump’s policies, and the deals bonanza they’ve ignited, have changed the strategic calculus for companies like 21shares. Regulatory hurdles have eased, and the stalwarts of Wall Street are getting into crypto — putting the onus on incumbents to build a competitive moat around themselves. “The regulatory environment finally allowed this to happen faster,” said Russell Barlow, 21shares’s chief executive officer, in an interview, declining to disclose the size of the deal. In terms of its roadmap, “what we thought we could do in five years we can now compress in two to three years.” For most of the past decade, the firm carved out a niche in Europe while U.S. authorities blocked spot-crypto ETFs. Then, in early 2024, the SEC under then-President Joe Biden lifted that ban. Switzerland-based 21shares suddenly found itself competing in a far more crowded field. Speed comes with a cost: the same regulatory clarity that enables deals also invites new competition. Low-cost Bitcoin and Ether ETFs overseen by giants like BlackRock Inc. and Fidelity started raking in multibillion-dollar investor flows and now command more than $173 billion in assets taken together. BlackRock’s IBIT Bitcoin and its Ether ETF oversee $87 billion and $15 billion respectively, compared with the $11 billion total for 21shares across more than 50 products. As crypto merges into mainstream finance, firms like FalconX and 21shares are racing to stay competitive in an increasingly crowded field, according to Nate Geraci of NovaDius Wealth Management. “We’re witnessing a land rush in crypto ETPs,” he said. “With new listing standards in place, the floodgates are set to open—making this an ideal time for a deal like this.” FalconX, founded in 2018 and valued at $8 billion in a 2022 funding round, earlier this year bought Arbelos Markets, a trading firm focused on crypto derivatives. Its capabilities in trading and financing now extend to product creation. 21shares will retain its 100-strong staff and operate independently, with plans to launch 18 U.S. funds this year and expand into the Middle East and Asia. FalconX and 21shares aim to design strategies that weave digital assets into traditional markets, tokenized bonds and equities—for instance, by using blockchain to settle trades, per Barlow. The FalconX-21shares tie-up is one in a string of billion-dollar bets redrawing crypto’s industrial map, beyond ETPs and prime brokerage. This year’s completed deals include several multibillion-dollar transactions. Coinbase Global Inc. acquired derivatives platform Deribit for $2.9 billion in May, while Ripple spent more than $2 billion buying prime broker Hidden Road and corporate-treasury firm GTreasury. Crypto targets have also drawn bidders from outside the sector, including CoreWeave Inc.’s $9 billion offer for Bitcoin miner and data-center operator Core Scientific Inc. in July. “Consolidation in crypto is pushing firms to integrate vertically,” said Karl-Martin Ahrend, cofounder of digital-asset investment bank Areta. “Market makers, custodians, and infrastructure players are moving closer to the end investor as ETFs and regulation open new channels for institutional capital.” Some crypto heavyweights have already moved to tap the rebound in sentiment, going public to build cash and acquisition firepower. Circle Internet Group Inc., issuer of the second-largest stablecoin, raised $1.1 billion in June, while exchange operator Gemini Space Station Inc. collected $425 million in September. The question now is whether this burst of dealmaking will be enough to hold off global banks such as Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Citigroup Inc.—and payment groups from Stripe Inc. to Revolut Ltd.—as they step in to exploit clearer regulation and rising demand for digital-asset offerings. Traditional finance has scale and distribution on its side; crypto firms have speed and technical depth. The window for that advantage is narrow, and consolidation may be their best chance to use it. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Title: Republic Technologies announces US$100 million to buy ETH
URL: https://www.blogto.com/sponsored/2025/10/republic-technologies-partner-content/
Time Published: 2025-10-23T19:39:32Z
Full Content:
This content was provided by one of blogTO’s client partners. blogTO was not involved in the creation of the content. Republic Technologies (CSE: DOCT) (FSE: 7FM0) (WKN: A41AYF) (“Republic”), a publicly traded Ethereum infrastructure company, has announced a US$100 million secured convertible note facility with a leading institutional investor to expand its Ethereum infrastructure and ETH treasury. The financing carries 0 per cent interest and features an initial US$10 million tranche. Under the terms of the facility, over 90 per cent of proceeds will be allocated to acquiring ETH to support Republic’s expanding validator infrastructure and attestation operations. Republic has secured some of the best terms in the market for financing of its size. The facility carries 0 per cent interest and has no mark-to-market requirements on collateral, meaning Republic can never face margin calls or default events. This provides strong financial stability and flexibility for the company to deploy capital efficiently. In comparison, similar facilities in the market typically charge 8 to 10 per cent interest and require up to twice the collateral. Republic’s business model combines treasury management with blockchain infrastructure, distinguishing itself among the few companies that treat cryptocurrency as a productive asset rather than a passive holding. In practice, Republic deploys its ETH treasury to operate validator infrastructure that produces attestations, which are cryptographic signatures that secure the Ethereum network. These validator activities not only contribute to network integrity and performance but also generate sustainable, recurring income for the company. This the “DAT++" approach integrates traditional treasury holdings with infrastructure-driven validator revenues and creates dual revenue engines that compound growth. Building on this foundation, Republic takes income generation a step further. When acquiring ETH, the company employs sophisticated purchasing strategies collectively referred to as “Synthetic Mining” — to generate additional returns and compound its ETH holdings without issuing new equity. According to company disclosures, these strategies have delivered weekly returns of around 1.75 per cent, translating to annualized returns between 80 per cent to 100 per cent, enabling Republic to expand its balance sheet without diluting shareholders. The company has partnered with QCP Capital — one of Metaplanet’s earliest and most significant trading partners — to design and execute its structured strategies. In parallel, Republic is onboarding leading validator infrastructure providers to streamline ETH deployments and consolidate recurring income streams. Together, these initiatives form a self-reinforcing cycle in which Republic’s treasury and infrastructure business strengthen one another, compounding long-term growth. Blending experience from traditional finance and digital assets, Republic’s leadership team includes professionals with successful exits and prior roles at Goldman Sachs, Apollo Global Management, IDG Capital, and OKX. Chief Executive Officer Daniel Liu comes from a long-established energy family. The Liu family has led multiple publicly listed energy companies around the world, including Canadian Solar (NASDAQ: CSIQ) and GCL Group (NASDAQ: GCL). Before building the world’s most successful Bitcoin exchange with OKX in 2019, Liu worked at CIT Bank, where he specialized in renewable energy financings and oversaw more than US$5 billion in utility-scale power and infrastructure transactions across California and Hawaii, according to people familiar with the team. Rooted in this background, Liu and the Republic team were early to frame Ethereum as “digital fuel” — a foundational resource powering the next generation of financial and computational systems. “Coming from a family with decades in energy and infrastructure, I’ve seen how industry veterans are now turning their attention to the next wave of innovation,” Liu was quoted as saying in the company’s investor presentation. “When introduced to Ethereum infrastructure and ETH treasury strategies, many recognized parallels to oil decades ago—as a foundational asset with outsized potential.” Ethereum blockchain is the world’s largest decentralized computing network, powering smart contracts, tokenized assets, and trustless financial settlement. To keep Ethereum secure and running around the clock, participants operate validator infrastructure that stakes ETH, the network’s native asset, and generates attestations that verify data interactions across the network. Therefore, ETH functions as the essential fuel of the digital economy, much like oil powers the physical world. As on-chain economic activity expands, the value of ETH grows in tandem. As of Oct. 2025, more than US$300 billion in value is secured on Ethereum. By Feb. 2025, over 50 major institutions, including BlackRock, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Franklin Templeton, Deutsche Bank, and Visa, had begun building infrastructure and launching financial products on Ethereum. Ethereum is also being adopted in central bank and government pilot programs across major economies. ETH is the only cryptocurrency besides Bitcoin that has been formally recognized by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) as a commodity. The rise of real-world applications is driving on-chain activity and deepening demand for ETH, reinforcing its role as the backbone of a growing digital financial system. Republic Technologies Inc. is a publicly traded technology company integrating Ethereum infrastructure into the global economy. Backed by an ETH‑denominated treasury, we operate proprietary validator and attestation networks to safeguard data integrity for universal applications.

Title: With $1 trillion pay package on the line, Elon Musk blasts influential firms telling shareholders to reject it: ‘Those guys are corporate terrorists’

Role: ReporterMarco Quiroz-Gutierrez is a reporter for Fortune covering general business news. Elon Musk stole the show in the final minutes of Tesla’s Wednesday earnings call to label the advisory firms pushing shareholders to reject his $1 trillion pay package “corporate terrorists.” After months of being relatively quiet following his resignation from the Department of Government Efficiency and subsequent fallout with President Donald Trump, Musk slammed proxy advisory firms Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) and Glass Lewis. “I just don’t feel comfortable building a robot army here and then being ousted because of some asinine recommendations from ISS and Glass Lewis, who have no freaking clue,” Musk said. “I mean, those guys are corporate terrorists.” Musk, in a separate X post on Wednesday, also called into question the role of proxy advisory firms generally. The Tesla CEO echoed criticism from ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood by saying these firms—which issue recommendations to shareholders for how they should vote on proposals at public companies’ annual shareholder meetings—have too much sway, especially with passive investors like index funds, which have substantial voting power because of the shares they hold for clients. “ISS and Glass Lewis have no actual ownership themselves and often vote along random political lines unrelated to shareholder interests! This is a major problem that is not just limited to Tesla,” Musk wrote on X. However, advisory firms do not vote directly in annual shareholder meetings and merely recommend positions that are also individually analyzed by some of the biggest institutional investors, including BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street, which do their own in-house research. Both ISS and Glass Lewis twice recommended voters reject Musk’s previous 2018 pay package. Shareholders ultimately approved the package twice. A spokesperson for Glass Lewis told Fortune in a statement its job is to provide analysis and recommendations to its clients. “Those that are Tesla shareholders will ultimately make their own decisions about Mr. Musk’s pay proposal and the Board directors that put it forward for shareholder vote,” the statement read. ISS declined to comment. Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Musk, who has a net worth of $455 billion, said he needs an ownership stake “in the mid-20s approximately” to achieve his goals at Tesla. The pay package in question would give Musk about $1 trillion over 10 years if he meets performance metrics, one of which includes boosting the company’s market cap more than 500% to $8.5 trillion. ISS and Glass Lewis both issued reports earlier this month questioning Musk’s pay package, in part because of the package’s size and because it would dilute existing shareholders’ holdings. While Tesla claimed regular benchmarking doesn’t apply to Musk’s pay, because no other company has “remotely similar goals embodied in their compensation programs,” Glass Lewis wrote in its report that Musk’s 2025 performance award is “unprecedented” compared with that of other public companies, and around 33.5x larger than its predecessor from 2018. “It is clear that the quantum, on a realizable and granted basis, outpaces all other pay packages.” © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Can Google’s 13,000× “quantum echoes” put Bitcoin’s keys on a clock?

Google’s Willow chip earned verifiable quantum advantage this week; here’s what that does, and doesn’t, mean for ECDSA, SHA-256, and coins with revealed public keys. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. For decades, physicists have promised that quantum computing would one day outrun classical machines. That day may have arrived. On Oct. 22, Google’s Willow quantum processor completed a task that supercomputers would need 150 years to finish by compressing centuries of calculation into two hours. Industry experts say the result, verified by Nature, isn’t only a triumph for science. It’s a tremor through the foundations of digital security, sparking a renewed question in financial circles: how close are we to a future where quantum power can break Bitcoin’s cryptography? The breakthrough centers on the Out-of-Time-Order Correlator (OTOC), or “Quantum Echoes,” algorithm. By running it on 105 physical qubits at 99.9% fidelity, Willow became the first processor to achieve verifiable quantum advantage, proving that a quantum computer can solve a complex physical model faster and more precisely than any classical supercomputer. In simple terms, Willow didn’t just calculate; it perceived. Its output revealed molecular structures and magnetic interactions that were mathematically invisible to traditional systems. The processor outperformed classical machines by a factor of 13,000, completing the computation in hours instead of years. This milestone follows years of incremental progress. In 2019, Google’s Sycamore chip first demonstrated “quantum supremacy.” By 2024, Willow had corrected its own quantum errors in real time. The 2025 achievement goes further, offering the first fully verifiable, independently confirmed result that transforms quantum computing from theory to proof. Speaking on the milestone, Sundar Pichai, Google’s CEO, said: “This breakthrough is a significant step toward the first real-world application of quantum computing, and we’re excited to see where it leads.” Bitcoin’s architecture rests on elliptic curve and hash-based cryptography, specifically the SHA-256 algorithm. Its security depends on how long it would take even the fastest computer to reverse a private key from its corresponding public key. This is a feat that would take classical machines billions of years. However, a quantum computer capable of running Shor’s algorithm could, in theory, crack those cryptographic primitives exponentially faster. In practice, Bitcoin remains secure for now. Google’s Willow uses just 105 qubits, far below the millions of error-corrected, logical qubits needed to threaten real-world cryptography. Yet, that doesn’t fully comfort analysts like Jameson Lopp, who estimates that around 25% of all Bitcoin (roughly 4.9 million BTC) sits in addresses whose public keys are already exposed. These coins, belonging mostly to early users and dormant wallets, would be the first to face risk if a cryptographically capable quantum system emerged. Moreover, institutional concerns have also begun to surface. Earlier in the year, BlackRock, issuer of the world’s largest Bitcoin ETF, flagged quantum risk, warning that advances in computing could “undermine the cryptographic framework underpinning Bitcoin.” While the firm noted that such threats remain “theoretical at this stage,” it stressed that disclosure was necessary to inform investors about technology that “could alter [BTC’s] fundamental security assumptions.” Despite the headlines, most industry experts caution against panic. Bitcoin expert Timothy Peterson also argued that Willow’s impressive results are far from posing a practical threat. According to him: “Even under wildly optimistic and incorrectly extrapolated assumptions (that the quantum device can do SHA-256 at that rate and sustain it), it would still take ~10 hours on average to find one block. And Bitcoin’s entire global network produces one every 10 minutes.” Bitcoin entrepreneur Ben Sigman agrees with this view, while pointing out that: “[Google] still need millions of stable, error-corrected qubits before quantum computers can reach a ‘useful’ scale – the kind that could threaten encryption or Bitcoin.” In fact, Anis Chohan, the CTO of Inflectiv.ai, told CryptoSlate that “we’re looking at least a decade, possibly two, before it becomes a real concern.” Still, not everyone is reassured. Charles Edwards, founder of Capriole, warned that ignoring quantum risk could result in the “biggest bear market ever” by next year. Meanwhile, Jeff Park, CIO at ProCap BTC, offered a more philosophical view by framing quantum computing as the “climate change” of Bitcoin. He said: “Quantum computing is basically the climate change of Bitcoin. Plenty of idiots who deny it because they can’t possibly grasp the amorphous or the astronomical, and plenty of scientists that understand it yet have no socially compelling solutions to offer.” Beyond speculation, developers are already exploring post-quantum cryptography that involves new systems based on lattice problems, multivariate equations, and hash-based signatures that can resist quantum attacks. The US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has shortlisted several such algorithms for standardization. At the same time, Bitcoin Core contributors have floated proposals for gradual migration toward quantum-resistant address formats. However, implementing them requires broad consensus across miners, exchanges, and wallet providers, which is a governance feat nearly as complex as the technology itself. Still, Chohan concluded: “We’ve seen similar fears before. People once thought RSA encryption was unbreakable, then feared it could be broken overnight. Each time, we adapted. Quantum computing presents a genuine challenge, but we’re already working on post-quantum cryptography. Since governments, banks, and crypto networks all rely on similar encryption standards, everyone has a shared stake in protecting them. It’s not a question of if we’ll solve this—it’s about managing the transition responsibly and smoothly.” Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

© 2025 Coinspeaker LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. BlackRock withdrew $97.63M in Bitcoin and Ethereum from Coinbase Prime while Grayscale deposited $138.06M, signaling potential capital rotation between ETF managers. Onchain analyses suggest BlackRock could be buying more Bitcoin BTC $111 571 24h volatility: 0.4% Market cap: $2.22 T Vol. 24h: $23.27 B and Ethereum ETH $3 955 24h volatility: 0.4% Market cap: $477.36 B Vol. 24h: $12.51 B for its exchange-traded funds (ETFs), while Grayscale, another ETF manager, could be selling theirs. These diverging signals often show up in times of high volatility and price consolidation, as market participants place their bets on different outcomes, but can also appear in capital rotation from one product to another. In particular, Lookonchain spotted the most recent activity and reported it in a post on Oct. 23. According to the post, BlackRock withdrew 681 BTC and 6,000 ETH, valued at $74.72 million and $22.91 million, respectively, from Coinbase Prime. Withdrawing from crypto exchanges usually means a purchase has been made and the assets are being moved to a more secure wallet. Grayscale is selling while BlackRock is buying! Grayscale deposited 525 $BTC($57.22M) and 21,030 $ETH($80.84M) to #CoinbasePrime 3 hours ago. Meanwhile, BlackRock withdrew 681 $BTC($74.72M) and 6,000 $ETH($22.91M) from #CoinbasePrime an hour ago.https://t.co/OcQGQe8US6… pic.twitter.com/enqkl7tBKU — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) October 23, 2025 Meanwhile, Grayscale was seen depositing $57.22 million and $80.84 million of 525 BTC and 21,030 ETH, respectively, also to Coinbase Prime. Depositing to crypto exchanges usually means intention to sell, which may or may not be consolidated in the orders book. Interestingly, BlackRock’s highest dollar-denominated value is for its Bitcoin withdrawals, while Grayscale had a more significant volume for its Ethereum deposits—suggesting a higher demand for BTC and a higher supply pressure to ETH if we consider these two players in isolation at the Coinbase Prime market. These movements match ETF net flow data from Oct. 22, per CoinGlass data, suggesting a capital rotation from Grayscale ETFs to BlackRock ETFs. For Bitcoin, Grayscale’s GBTC registered an outflow of 522.85 BTC, while BlackRock’s IBIT registered a 679.88 BTC inflow. Grayscale’s ETHE and ETH, together, registered 20,690 ether outflow, absorbed by BlackRock’s ETHA plus nearly 8,000 ETH more (28,600 ether inflow for ETHA). Bitcoin and Ethereum net flow for GBTC, IBIT, ETHE, ETH, and ETHA | Source: CoinGlass In their lifetime, GBTC sold 245,430 BTC, while IBIT purchased 667,270 BTC. Out of that, both sold, respectively, 3,310 BTC and 310 BTC since Oct. 10 alone, following the unprecedented crash that liquidated more than $19 billion from crypto traders. Something similar happened to Ethereum ETFs, having outflows in these past nine days over their lifetime activity. Grayscale sold more than 1.08 million ETH from the two ETFs combined, with 145,270 since Oct. 10 alone. BlackRock’s ETHA had a 4.03 million total inflow and a 4.10 million inflow from its launch to Oct. 9, losing around 70,000 ETH in the past nine days. As Coinspeaker reported, all Bitcoin ETFs combined experienced $101 million in outflows on Oct. 22, with analysts turning bearish. Yet, market participants started to turn bullish as Donald Trump pardoned Changpeng Zhao (CZ), Binance founder, who recently predicted Bitcoin will eventually flip gold in market value.

Full Content:
A man has been found guilty of the murder of Kieran Quilligan whose skeletal remains were found dumped in scrubland in Cork City over two years ago. Niall Long (33), formerly of St Michael’s Close, Mahon, Cork had denied the murder of Mr Quilligan (47) on a date unknown between September 1st 2023 and January 29th 2024. The jury of 10 men and two women returned after four hours and 47 minutes of deliberations on Thursday and found Long guilty of the murder of Quilligan. Long was remanded in custody by Ms Justice Siobhán Lankford for sentence at a later date. Meanwhile, the jury asked for more time to consider the evidence against Long’s co-accused, Luke Taylor (27), formerly of Cherry Lawn, Blackrock, Cork and Ms Justice Lankford asked them to return on Friday to continue their deliberations with regard to Mr Taylor. During the trial, the jury heard that Quilligan’s murder had its origins in an incident where he and another man allegedly robbed Long of drugs and cash off York St in Cork City on September 1st 2023 and Quilligan disappeared later that day. Quilligan’s partner Colette O’Driscoll said that the last time she saw her partner was when he left their apartment at Riverview on Anderson’s Quay in Cork City centre accompanied by Mr Taylor shortly before 9pm on the night of September 1st, 2023. “He [Quilligan] said he would be back in five to 10 minutes when he left with Luke Taylor – I never saw him again,” said Ms O’Driscoll, adding that when he failed to return home, she reported him missing to An Garda Síochána three days later on September 4th. The jury heard that gardaí were able to track Quilligan walking with Mr Taylor up the quays in Cork City to St Finbar’s Placebut there was no sign of him ever emerging at the top of the steps on to Fort Street. However, they heard evidence a white Toyota Rav 4 was seen entering Fort Street and reversing into the steps at the top of St Finbarr’s Place and it was later tracked on CCTV going to Little Island and Rostellan in east Cork where Quilligan’s skeletal remains were found on January 29th, 2024. Assistant State Pathologist, Dr Margot Bolster said she was unable to say exactly when Quilligan had died or give a precise cause of death due to the length of time between his death and the postmortem which had resulted in the decay and disappearance of all soft tissue and organs. However, Dr Bolster said it was clear Quilligan had been the victim of a serious assault as he had suffered numerous injuries, including fractures of the temporal bone, parietal bone and mandible or jawbone in the head as well as fractures to several ribs, leg bones and hand bones. The jury also heard evidence from Dr Sarah Fleming of Forensic Science Ireland that she forensically examined blood stains found in the boot of a white Toyota Rav 4 belonging to Long’s mother Janice, and it provided a DNA match with Quilligan. A mat from the boot of the car had DNA profile matches for both Quilligan and Long while bloodstaining on a headrest had a DNA profile match for Quilligan and a light bloodstain on a label of part of a T-shirt found in the car matched both Quilligan’s and Long’s DNA. The jury also heard from Sgt Maurice O’Connor how gardaí were able to retrieve a text sent by Long’s mother, Janice from her phone on September 2nd, 2023, in which she said she noticed a smell of Dettol in the boot of her white Toyota Rav 4. Although gardaí never found Long’s phone they were able to establish the content of a replying message he sent in which he said, “Yeah, it does, the fellow who robbed me and cut my neck got a hiding and got thrown in the boot, so the boot was cleaned.” The case continues.

Title: City-States Without Limits – Part 2
URL: https://www.activistpost.com/city-states-without-limits-part-2/
Time Published: 2025-10-23T16:00:00Z
Full Content:
In Part 1, we discussed the NRx technocrats’ ideas and how they have influenced the city-state model that seeks to capitalise on the global proliferation of Special Economic Zones (SEZs). We examined the role of functional oligarchies in this endeavor. In Part 2, we look at how that city-state model manifests internationally and what it implies, not just for global governance structures, but for humanity. In Part 1, we explored the ideology that has been adopted by a powerful group of NRx technocrat-oligarchs and how their proposals align with the interests of their international oligarch partners. We discussed the venture capital impact investment strategy the NRx technocrats call “accelerationism” and how governments are actually “functional oligarchies.” The model of “government” the NRx technocrats propose is unlike anything we are currently familiar with. It is much more akin to the kind of authoritarian dictatorships exercised by the feudal monarchs of Medieval Europe. These gov-corp Technates, as envisaged, effectively amount to dictatorial city-states under the direct control of oligarchs. The NRx technocrats seek to break nation-states apart into technologically governed “enclaves” (gov-corp Technates). These “realms” will form an international “Patchwork,” with each enclave or “network archipelago” represented as a digital node, almost certainly on a single, overarching blockchain or “unified ledger.” The digital access permissions to the node, which serves as the digital twin for the physical realm of the city-state “enclave,” will be controlled by the “founder” or their selected administrators of the realm. This forms a gov-corp Technate ruled by a CEO King (oligarch) where “nothing officially exists” unless it is represented digitally on the realm’s ledger (blockchain). The citizens of the realm are customers of the sovereign corporation (sovcorp) that rules the gov-corp Technate. The customers will have no individual sovereignty unless they purchase it from the “founder.” All value is digital in the realm. The life of your “digital twin,” monitored through the requirement to use digital ID, seamlessly links a customer’s offline life to that of their online digital twin. By controlling the programmable digital currency allotted to the customer’s digital twin, via their digital ID, any misbehaviour can be punished by the founder or their delegated system administrators. For example, by freezing “their deposits” or locking people “out of all doors for a time period as a punishment.” There are no means of recourse in a gov-corp Technate. The only option open to the persecuted customer is to flee, if they have the means. We also discussed how governments around the world have already started carving out nascent gov-corp Technates in the form of thousands of Special Economic Zones (SEZs). Some of which, such as Shenzhen in China, have already been established as de facto city-states with their own increasingly independent jurisdictions and embryonic city-state governments. At the heart of this effort to create a global patchwork of city-states are the NRx technocrats, perhaps most notably Peter Thiel, Elon Musk and Marc Andreessen in the US, and venture capital firms like NeWay Capital and Pronomos Capital. But they are far from alone. The NRx technocrat network is global and, at the highest governmental and intergovernmental level, the hope is to bring about the global governance of a patchwork of city-state gov-corp Technates. NRx technocrats want to create a global “patchwork” of digital surveillance societies where “nothing officially exists unless it’s on-chain.” All value is digital and the private founder[s], by virtues of the supreme sovereignty they have purchased with their investment, control their private fiefdoms as CEO “kings” of the ruling corporations. In effect, by exploiting digital technology and, most notably, Artificial Intelligence (AI), the NRx technocrats want to create a global network of privately financed smart-cities. A smart-city can be said to be “an urban area where technology and data collection help improve [. . .] the sustainability and efficiency of city operations. [. . .] Technologies to collect data—including real-time data—are central to smart-city initiatives.” The objective of smart-city design is to control the urban environment and its inhabitants’ behaviour. Taking a positive view of smart-city behavioural control, researchers from the Indonesian Journal of Information Systems and Informatics nonetheless noted: The influence of smart city technology on consumer behavior in urban environments and people’s daily routines and lifestyle habits is significant. [. . .] The development of smart-cities through the application of various technologies such as smart transportation systems, traffic management applications, and smart sensors [. . .] has changed the behavior of people. [. . .] Thus, the application of smart city technology not only transforms city infrastructure and services, but also brings significant changes in citizen behavior. Though behavioural control exercised by smart-city operators could possibly be benign, it could also be abused by despots to effectively program our lives. That is certainly what the NRx technocrats have in mind—engineering the “unthinking demos” whose sovereignty will be treated with “derision.” Regardless of the risks, smart-cities are being constructed the world over. The China Global Television Network (CGTN) is part of the state-run China Media Group. In July of this year, CGTN reported how the Chinese government was “accelerating” the development of smart-cities. CGTN revealed that Shenzhen won an international award for smart-city of the year from the 2024 Smart-City Expo World Congress (SCEWC). The SCEWC emphasised how the congress was impressed with Shenzhen’s application of the Chinese “Smarter City, Better Life” policy initiative that seeks to address “urban challenges” through the rapid deployment of technology. Just like the NRx technocrats in the West, Chinese policy think tanks apparently see technology as the solution; full stop. The SCEWC said: The initiative has pursued an aggressive digital transformation strategy to address these challenges across various sectors. Key components include the development of high-speed broadband networks, using digital twin technology to model and manage city systems, and integrating artificial intelligence and data-driven governance into city operations. [. . .] The city has also fostered an environment that encourages technological innovation and has attracted significant investment from private companies developing smart-city technologies. Again, there is no notable difference between the stakeholder capitalist—public-private partnership—finance model for smart-city construction in China’s SEZs than that found anywhere else. The SCEWC continued: Shenzhen has pioneered the “4321+X” model for smart community development, emphasizing integrating government networks, video networks, IoT sensor networks, and the internet to create comprehensive data and service platforms. These platforms provide a foundation for various smart city applications, including public safety management, community governance, and the delivery of public services. The 4321+X smart-city “community” is controlled based upon a set of clearly defined processes. The “4” refers to the integration of four data networks: the government’s network, private community CCTV networks, the internet, and specifically the Internet of Things (IoT). The “3” relates to the three areas of community activity to be integrated within and surveilled through the four networks: all business, public security (public conduct), and the local governance of services, including local security services. The “2” Refers to two major service sectors—called “platforms”—that combine to effect the monitoring of the three key areas of activity linked to the four networks. The two “platforms” are local government and law enforcement. Finally, the “1” refers to the master database which, when Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT)—such as blockchain—is used, could be called the “unified ledger.” The ledger ties all the surveillance of the entire smart-city, combining 4, 3, and 2 together, into one centrally administered smart-city system. The smart-city supposedly facilitates “X” which is the artificially intelligent delivery of governance and services to the citizen. The unified ledger (“1”) is monitored and controlled by the “Urban Brain” or “City Brain” which is the central command system for the smart-city. The Urban Planning Society of China—a non-governmental organisation (NGO) that operates by approval from China’s Ministry of Construction and Ministry of Civil Affairs—states that the purpose of the “Urban Brain” is to allocate “public resources” and enhance “social governance” in order to provide “new pathways for promoting sustainable economic and social development.” As we noted in Part 1, China’s modern technological innovation is overwhelmingly the result of public-private partnership. In Hangzhou, for instance, the City Brain is managed by one global corporation: Alibaba is the powerhouse of the technology from data platforms to advance analytics algorithm that enables all the smart city application. In NRx technocrat terms, Alibaba Group is the sovereign corporation (sovcorp) of the city of Hangzhou, with a considerable ability to potentially control the lives of its nine million citizens or “customers.” As with all smart-city developments, the media only reports the realised or projected social benefits. The likely pitfalls are studiously ignored. To understand the danger we all face, if we take to living in such cities, we first need to consider how social credits systems are intended to work. There are many, persistent myths peddled in the West about China’s Social Credit System (SCS). The mainstream media will sometimes have you believe that it is already a totalitarian nightmare and some in the independent media will try to convince you that is doesn’t exist. The truth lies somewhere in between. China is the only country to have formally established an SCS, but it is not the only country to have implemented one. The purpose of social credit is to reward or punish citizen behaviour, not through the courts or any legal process, but through the enhanced or restricted access to both public and private services. Operation Choke Point in the US saw the Department of Justice collaborate with private banks to cut-off access to finance for entirely legal small to medium size businesses deemed to present a “reputational risk.” Similarly, in Canada, the government worked with private banks, and insurers to shut down the small businesses of lawful and legitimate protestors. These are just a couple of the many clear examples of SCS operating in the West. China’s SCS was formally established in 2014. It is a sprawling and often confusing slew of government directives and regulations that each provincial authority has to decipher and apply as best as it can. The overarching objective is to establish a measure of “societal creditworthiness.” This does not just mean “credit” in the financial sense. It relates to the degree of “trustworthiness” the state credits to its own departments and local administrations, to businesses and to individuals. China’s SCS refers to “entities,” meaning both public and private organisations, including businesses. Much of the SCS is focused upon cleaning up public sector corruption, eliminating the “untrustworthiness” of those entities in order to promote a “harmonious” society. It also focuses on the “untrustworthiness” of individuals. An SCS objective is to “put untrustworthy individuals on a credit blacklist.” Another is to develop online systems to evaluate individual’s online social credit “trustworthiness” and, for instance, to punish those who engage in online “rumour-mongering;” it talks about systems to assess the “individual character” of citizens and the enforcement of “citizen morality.” In China, a “natural person” is a legal construct that means a human being or citizen. In its 2025 announced improvements to its SCS, the Chinese government encouraged regional authorities to promote “the credit construction of natural persons” and to establish “sound credit records of natural persons.” Looking at the development of the smart-city in Shenzhen, and the risks of pooling “big data,” researchers from the Berlin Institute of Chinese Studies found: [T]he digital systems in Shenzhen entail a creeping centralisation of data that potentially turns lower administrative government units into mere users of the city-level smart platforms rather than being in control of their own data resources. Smart city development and big data ambitions thereby imply shifting stakeholder relations at the local level and also pull non-governmental stakeholders, such as information technology companies and research institutions, closer to new data flows and smart governance systems. In a world shaped by stakeholder capitalism, “smart governance systems” are invariably controlled by the private sector. Local governments become the “mere users” of the “City Brains” overseen by multinational corporations. The evident objective is to link the behavioural control afforded by smart-city technology to SCS. As pointed out by MIT Technology Review in 2022, there is currently no crushing, universal social credit score in China that enables totalitarian control: There’s no evidence yet that this system has been abused for widespread social control (though it remains possible that it could be wielded to hurt individual rights). Indeed, smart-city technology combined with SCS certainly could be wielded to socially engineer populations. The push towards smart-city developments capable of applying SCS “rules” are by no means restricted to China. It is a global governance policy agenda and the rollout of the necessary digital infrastructure is worldwide. Though most of us are yet to experience the looming overt systematic oppression, it is extremely unwise to ignore that fact that the likely digital panopticon is being erected around us. If we accept the ongoing transformation of the places we live into smart-cities and smart-suburbs, it is the “trust” we will have placed in our rulers, whoever they may be, that is the salient issue. We will have no choice but to trust that the digital control systems we will live in are purely for our benefit. We will have to trust that the enforcement of the SCS rules will be equitable. There is currently no reason to think that will be the case. The potential urban future that the oligarchs driving this agenda have in mind is aligned with the ambitions of the NRx technocrats. It appears that our planned smart city-state future is an envisioned tyranny. The global proliferation of SEZs provides plenty of enticing investment opportunities for NRx technocrats and other oligarchs (See Part 1). SEZs, however, are just one avenue for the potential location of gov-corp Technates. The global transition toward urbanization offers many more. Ironically, the United Nations (UN) both reports on the rampant criminality common to many SEZ developments but also advocates the rapid and significant expansion of SEZs. As noted in Part 1, there is currently little or no evidence that SEZs deliver socioeconomic growth. There is considerable evidence that they seize national territory and transform it into effective private jurisdictions. Yet, in 2022, the UN established the Global Alliance of Special Economic Zones (GASEZ) to increase the SEZ global footprint. GASEZ claims: Special economic zones (SEZs) can make important contributions to economic growth and sustainable development. Zones can help attract investment, create jobs, boost exports, and build productive capacity. [. . .] Collectively SEZs can be more effective in modernization and policy advocacy, and bring on board stakeholders, including governments, the private sector and international organizations. Again, there is virtually no evidence to support GASEZ’ assertions about economic growth. The reason the UN is enthusiastic about SEZ hybrid zone/city developments is that the UN considers them a more effective route for its global “policy advocacy.” Launching GASEZ in 2022, the UN announced: UNCTAD [United Nations Conference on Trade and Development ] joined hands with seven global, regional and national associations representing over 7,000 special economic zones (SEZs) to launch a global alliance. [. . .] They [SEZs] go by many different names, including free-trade zones and industrial parks, and are widely used by developed and developing economies. The Global Alliance of Special Economic Zones (GASEZ) seeks to drive the modernization of these zones across the world and maximize their contribution to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). [. . .] A new model of sustainable special economic zones is therefore rapidly taking shape and they are contributing to more inclusive, resilient and sustainable economies in the countries where they operate. The UN calls the towns and cities we live in “human settlements.” Charter Cities, SEZs with residential capacity, hybrid zone/city developments, resilient cities, 15-minute cities, etc., are all “human settlements” as far as the UN is concerned. Furthermore, all such urban renewal consistently embraces smart-city technology. In 1977, the UN created the United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat) in order to promote “socially and environmentally sustainable towns and cities.” UN-Habitat states: UN-Habitat is the focal point for all urbanization and human settlement matters within the UN system. [. . .] UN-Habitat collaborates with governments, intergovernmental, UN agencies, civil society organizations, foundations, academic institutions and the private sector to achieve enduring results in addressing the challenges of urbanization. Urbanization is the process of the population shift from rural to urban living environments, or human settlements in the vernacular of the UN. UN-Habitat has wholeheartedly adopted the public-private partnership, or stakeholder capitalist, model of development to address “the challenges of urbanization.” In 2018, the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UN DESA) reported the findings of its research into World Urbanization Prospects: Today, 55% of the world’s population lives in urban areas, a proportion that is expected to increase to 68% by 2050. Projections show that urbanization [. . .] combined with the overall growth of the world’s population could add another 2.5 billion people to urban areas by 2050, with close to 90% of this increase taking place in Asia and Africa. [. . .] By 2030, the world is projected to have 43 megacities with more than 10 million inhabitants, most of them in developing regions [. . .] many of them located in Asia and Africa. [. . .] As the world continues to urbanize, sustainable development depends increasingly on the successful management of urban growth, especially in low-income and lower-middle-income countries where the pace of urbanization is projected to be the fastest. With this urbanization prospectus in mind, and with a particular focus on managing urban development in the “Global South”—an umbrella term for developing nations wherever they are located—UN-Habitat released its Strategic Plan 2020-2023: UN-Habitat, in its role as a focal point, will call upon all development actors and stakeholders, [. . .] to work in concert to assist it in implementing its Strategic Plan. [. . .] An important effort is required to rethink engagement with the private sector to leverage investment in sustainable urbanization and to promote more appropriate models of development. The UN is eager to liberate private finance in order to construct human smart-megacity settlements, especially in the emerging and developing markets of the Global South, that meet UN sustainable urbanization targets. Sustainable Development Goal 11—SDG 11—defines the global public-private partnership’s city development agenda. The UN calls this its “New Urban Agenda.” The New Urban Agenda emphasises the importance of building “smart-cities” to meet SDGs: The New Urban Agenda calls for technology and communication networks to be strengthened and for smart-city approaches that use digitalization, clean energy and technologies. [. . .] Innovative funding opportunities and partnerships need to be explored and the capacity of local governments to effectively procure, test and implement frontier technologies needs to be significantly strengthened. [. . .] To contribute effectively to urban sustainability, frontier technologies and innovations need to be applied. The “smart-city” is constructed by deploying so-called “frontier technologies” within its infrastructure. A smart-city could be built from scratch or developed in an existing city or conurbation. The UN explains what smart-city frontier technology it considers essential for urban sustainability: [Frontier technologies] currently include, among others, the Internet of things, sensor networks, machine-to-machine communication, robotics, artificial intelligence, virtual and augmented reality, 3D printing, geographic information systems (GIS), remote sensing, autonomous unmanned vehicles, drones, blockchain, cryptographic computing, and big data processing and visualization. The UN’s “frontier technologies” are, of course, exactly the kind of technologies that the NRx technocrats allege to be the technological solution to everything (see Part 1). Gov-corp Technates are practically indistinguishable from the hybrid zone/city developments envisaged by the UN’s New Urban Agenda. The downside, from humanity’s perspective, is that at both the global intergovernmental level and at the global multinational corporate-network level, there is a firm commitment to install the biometric digital surveillance state that threatens to enslave us all. Though the UN calls this “sustainable development.” Not only is the UN amenable to the NRx technocrat’s digital panopticon plans, it also favours their “patchwork of realms” idea. The UN considers the future of global governance to lay in centralised global authority exerted over a transnational network of city-states. Or, as UN-Habitat puts it, “connectivity across urban networks, between cities and their surroundings [. . .] must be strengthened. That requires a country-wide – and sometimes cross-border – approach to development.” The UN’s global governance model has been moving in this direction or a while. In 2005, then London Mayor Ken Livingston convened the C20 city network, inviting mayors from another eighteen cities to work collectively to reduce so-called climate pollution (CO2 emissions). In 2006, the addition of 22 city mayors created the C40 cities network. The C40 cities network is financed by, among others, the Children’s Investment Fund Foundation (CIFF) which is heavily backed by the Gates Foundation. The aim of CIFF is to improve the lives of children living in the Global South by “lobbying” their governments to create regulatory “enabling environments” to stimulate national carbon trading in the global Emissions Trading Scheme (ETF) markets. Another prominent C40 funder is Bloomberg Philanthropies, led by oligarch and former New York City mayor, Michael Bloomberg. Always driven by a commitment to UN global governance policies, in 2011, C40 formalised its relationship with the UN by agreeing on a climate action partnership with the World Bank—a specialized agency of the UN. Such UN partnerships are in keeping with UN ambitions to cultivate its global governance through an international network of city-states. In 2013, American political theorist Benjamin R. Barber (1939 – 2017) published If Mayors Ruled the World: Dysfunctional Nations, Rising Cities. Barber contended that city administrations were more closely connected to their populations and thus more democratically representative than nation-states. He argued that city administrations, in countries around the world, had more in common with each other than they had with their own national governments. Unencumbered by political divisions and national rivalries, he posited that cities were better “building blocks of global governance.” Advocating a global network of cities, Barber wrote: If democracy is to survive globalization, imagining a global democratic order with the city at its core may be crucial. Envision not states but cities as building blocks for global governance. [. . .] Global governance in which the city predominates is the aim. Evidently enthused by Barber’s vision, Michael Bloomberg announced he was stepping down as Mayor of New York and set up the first CityLab summit in 2013. Mayors from cities around the world were invited to network and collaborate in order to “exchange ideas and tackle some of the most urgent issues affecting cities around the world.” In 2014, a month after officially leaving office in New York, Bloomberg was appointed as the UN’s first Special Envoy for Cities and Climate Change. Thus strengthening the link between urban development and the implementation of the global governance agenda. UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said the objective of creating the post for Bloomberg was for the UN to consult “with mayors and related key stakeholders” in order to “mobilize action among cities as part of [the UN’s] long-term strategy.” Already the president of the board of the C40 cities network, Bloomberg soon established the Compact of Mayors committing city leaders to implement UN SDGs. In 2016, the UN’s Global Compact of Mayors joined with the similar European Union’s (EU’s) Covenant of Mayors to become the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy (GCoM). Currently acting as the UN Secretary-General’s Special Envoy on Climate Ambition and Solutions, Michael Bloomberg is the current co-chair of the GCoM. The GCoM established the INVEST4CITIES initiative to generate “massive and targeted investment” to construct smart-cities. The private sector investment opportunity is set to provide “$23 trillion in investment potential” by 2030. The public sector’s (local government’s) role is to create “the enabling environments that support local investment.” The GCoM plan is that “large-scale financing instruments” will fund “local implementation” of frontier technologies to construct global governance (SDG) compliant smart-cities. In the same year (2016) that the GCoM was signed by an international network of mayors, Bloomberg created the Global Parliament of Mayors (GPM) to give the civic leaders formal global governance roles. The GPM was first mooted in 2013 by Bloomberg CityLab based on Benjamin Barber’s “idea of a global governance platform for cities.” Barber was personally involved in the formation of the GPM and, when he died in 2017, the GPM created the annual Benjamin Barber Award, given to the most global governance compliant mayor of the year. The purpose of the GPM is to attack the supposed political sovereignty of national governments and reimagine international relations. The GPM champions “the city’s right to self-government” and promotes “collective city decision-making across national borders.” The GPM is “actively engaged in decision-making by international organisations.” The GPM is the UN’s expression of Barber’s vision of “global governance in which the city predominates.” In 2017, adopting the NRx technocrats’ accelerationism, the C40 network started implementing a number of “High-Impact Accelerators.” The C40 accelerators form one of the “project pipelines” that contributes toward the GCoM’s INVEST4CITIES strategy. The GCoM aims to “accelerate city and local government access to financial resources” by “removing barriers to investor-oriented climate action plans and projects, and unlocking large-scale financing instruments to boost urban action implementation.” As you can imagine, with $23 trillion of investment opportunities in sight, the envisaged ROI is not only mouthwatering, if the planned city-state is a startup project it also promises oligarchs possible city ownership rights (see Part 1). The UN Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) convened the Day of Cities in 2019. Mayors from across, what the UN called, “the region”—meaning Europe—met to discuss “how to create smart sustainable cities.” This resulted in the 2020 Geneva Declaration of Mayors. In response to multiple alleged global crises—the pseudopandemic, the climate crisis, natural disasters, etc.—the UNECE mayors noted how the global policy response to the pseudopandemic could be adopted as a model for urban development: [C]ities were in lockdown – and many industries, transport networks and businesses closed – we [. . .] started to experience an unknown urban life: better air quality, the return of nature to our cities, and empty streets giving space to cyclists and pedestrians. [. . .] The pandemic provided a testing ground for what cities could look like; the transformation of urban spaces happened overnight. If there is only one lesson to learn from this crisis, it is that rapid change of our urban reality is possible [and] behaviour patterns can be adapted. [. . .] Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 11 calls for action to work towards [. . .] resilient and sustainable cities – it is now in our hands to place the SDGs at the centre of our recovery efforts and create new urban realities. Today, boasting “over 13,500 cities and local governments” from “6 continents and 147 countries” the GCoM alleges that it represents “more than 1.2 billion people.” It is, however, hard to see how GCoM “represents” anyone other than its public-private “stakeholders.” One wonders how many people who elect their local and city “representatives” in these GCoM coordinated cities and suburbs are told that they are consenting to global governance and the transformation of their communities into smart-city gov-corp Technates. Empty streets, no cars, drone ports, driverless AI controlled public transport, protein labs growing artificial food substitutes, augmented reality, insect-based snacks, and new religious identities are part of what leading oligarch-led think tank Chatham House (The Royal Institute of International Affairs) predicted in 2021 with its notion of our Futurescape. Whether this is the future city-life any of us want is irrelevant. At every level, NRx technocrats and their fellow oligarchs view such “urbanization” as the pathway to establishing effective global governance. That the UN considers societal lockdowns as an exemplar of what it calls a “better urban life” betrays the oligarchs’ true intentions. The United Nations (UN) declares that it is responsible for global governance. The UN also says that “governance” means: “the process of decision-making and the process by which decisions are implemented.” Therefore, the UN asserts that it is the body which makes and implements decisions—which manifest as government policy—for the world. UN-Habitat—the UN’s “focal point for all urbanization and human settlement matters”—with its New Urban Agenda to transform the urban environment into a global network of smart-cities, extols stakeholder capitalism and is keen to use the associated public-private partnership model. In 2022, UN-Habitat and the World Economic Forum (WEF) created the The Global Partnership for Local Investment (GPLI). The GPLI immediately set up the G20 Global smart-cities Alliance and clarified its public-private purpose: Public-private collaborations reflect a form of indirect management in public administration, where [. . .] public, private or non-profit partners make decisions jointly. [. . .] Public-private collaborations can repurpose city assets for the deployment of digital infrastructure. [. . .] Physical assets, such as rooftops, utility poles, street lights, traffic lights, ducts and more, can become smart assets and be used to drive efficiencies and new services. Public spaces and airspace can take on new value as technology, such as drones, enabl[e] [sic] new use cases. UN-Habitat and the WEF highlight the private sector investment opportunity for those with the wealth to capitalise on them—oligarchs: [S]mart-city services can generate new revenue streams and revenue savings to be shared between partners. The Futurescape imagined by Chatham House is under construction with the support of the United Nations and the “leading” multinational corporations aligned under the WEF umbrella. It is also a project shared by the BRICS+ group of nations and their corporate partners. The BRICS have established the General Assembly of Cities and Municipalities which will focus on “inter-municipal cooperation” rather than international cooperation. Following the 2025 BRICS summit in Brazil, the BRICS group issued a joint statement: One of the key topics shaping the future of the BRICS is the development of smart-cities supported by emerging technologies, particularly artificial intelligence (AI). [. . .] With the recent expansion of the BRICS to include countries such as Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Ethiopia, and Iran, the bloc is establishing itself as a leading platform for Global South cooperation [. . .] particularly in the realm of sustainable urbanization driven by technologies such as AI. [. . .] Artificial intelligence is increasingly being adopted in major BRICS cities, notably impacting urban planning, public service management, and civic engagement. China is at the forefront of developing AI-powered smart-cities, particularly in Shanghai and Shenzhen. The BRICS+ group emphasises the importance of the BRICS New Development Bank (NDB) to “finance sustainable infrastructure” and “increase lending for AI-driven public service projects.” The group observes that “South-South cooperation through the BRICS creates active dialogue.” The UN considers cooperation in the “South-South”—referring to partnerships between Southern hemisphere countries—“a key development modality to accelerate progress towards achieving the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.” The UN Office for South-South Cooperation (UNOSSC) collaborates strategically with the Islamic Development Bank (IsDB). In turn, the IsDB has a close working partnership with the NDB. Both the IsDB and the NDB have joined seven other “Multilateral Development Banks” (MDBs) to form a global collaborative partnership coordinated by the UN’s World Bank Group: A much scaled up global effort is thus required to [. . .] tackle transboundary [meaning cross-national border] challenges. [. . .] We [Heads of MDBs] will deepen our collaboration around joint innovative mechanisms for boosting private capital mobilization, both domestically and globally. [. . .] We recognize the need to explore further avenues for strengthening mobilization of private capital. Regardless of where you live on the Earth, your government’s commitment to creating a global network of smart hybrid zone/cities financed by “private capital” is unshakable because your government is following a global policy agenda it did not create and cannot change. In Vietnam, for example, the commitment to constructing smart-cities is significant. Vietnam’s state media, The Voice of Vietnam (VoV), reports: Vietnam is undergoing a sweeping transformation with a clear goal: to build smart-cities that serve the people. The effort is based on national strategies like the Sustainable smart-city Development Plan 2018-2025 with a vision to 2030, the National Digital Transformation Program until 2025 with a vision to 2030, the E-Government Development Strategy toward a Digital Government, and Project 06 on population data and digital identity. The VoV states that residents in smart-cities can “report issues directly to authorities, who respond and take corrective action.” Vietnamese digital smart-city citizens can raise concerns relating to “public security[,] environmental management, healthcare, [. . .] education,” and more via their installed smart-city app. The VoV enthusiastically notes that centrally located AI monitored Intelligent Operations Centers (IOCs)—Urban or City Brains—linked to peoples’ devices and their Vietnam Electronic Identification (VNeID), issued by Vietnam’s Ministry of Public Security (MPS), effectively turn the Vietnamese smart-city citizens’ “smartphones into ‘microphones.’” The VoV adds: Citizens must also play their part: verifying VNeID at level 2, uploading personal documents to their digital accounts, using the national portal [. . .] for public services, downloading their local smart-city app, and using cashless payments wherever possible. Every tap on a screen lays another brick in building Vietnam’s vision of modern, intelligent, liveable cities for the future. The state taking almost unimaginable control of every “citizen’s” life is part of Vietnam’s digital transformation plan—Project 06. The Vietnamese government has already started the process of freezing up to 86 million of Vietnam’s estimated 200 million banks accounts unless they are “verified” using state approved digital ID (biometric authentication or VNeID). So clearly, every citizen “must” comply and the digital transformation, despite all the fluffy rhetoric about inclusion, is avowedly exclusionary. Project 06 is led by the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) working closely with the Ministry of Public Security (MPS). A major part of the role of the MPS is to ensure social order and to collect, analyse and evaluate information with a view to “prevent, detect and defeat any plots and acts of violation against national security and eliminate any threats to national security,” to protect the “Party” and the “State,” and to “implement international commitments and obligations.” The digital surveillance plan has been promoted by Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh and other government officials, but the Project 06 policy initiative did not originate with the Vietnamese government. With its stated “vision to 2030,” Project 06 is firmly rooted in the United Nations’ (UN’s) global governance agenda. The Vietnamese Ministry of Planning and Development noted that the country’s digital transformation will contribute to the reduction of (CO2) emissions, though it is obviously designed to enable state surveillance of the population. Speaking in January this year, UN Under-Secretary-General Amandeep Singh Gill said he was impressed with Vietnam’s public-private partnership (multistakeholder) approach to “harness digital technologies for inclusive, sustainable development.” He added: I saw with my own eyes how Viet Nam is pushing forward strongly and proactively in the areas of digital transformation and AI. [. . .] [F]rameworks are needed to ensure that everyone benefits from the technical advancement, and that no one is left behind. [. . .] The Global Digital Compact offers such a framework at the global level, and Viet Nam’s willingness to play an active role in key areas of the [sic] is welcomed and appreciated by the United Nations. The Global Digital Compact, adopted without a vote in September 2024 by UN member states as an annex to the UN’s Pact for the Future, is the UN’s “global framework” to facilitate “multi-stakeholder action” to enable “the attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals.” The UN defined “digital public goods” as software, data, AI models, and all content published online. Further, it decided that “digital public infrastructure” essentially meant all hardware and the physical infrastructure for all digital communication systems. The UN said that it considered “digital public goods and digital public infrastructure to be key drivers of inclusive digital transformation and innovation.” It added that “[g]overnments, the private sector, civil society, technical and academic communities and international and regional organizations” should work together to to “leverage digital public goods and digital public infrastructure to advance solutions for the Sustainable Development Goals.” In other words, the UN decided that the internet and digital technology, in its entirety, should be leveraged to deliver the UN’s global governance policy agendas. The UN invited the “private sector and philanthropic actors [oligarchs]” to finance the digital transformation. Populations might not want to go along with the digital transformation of their world, nor the degree of public-private state surveillance foisted upon them. Perhaps anticipating some pushback, the UN decided that anything that questioned its transformative global governance agenda constituted a “form of violence” it calls “misinformation and disinformation”: We must urgently counter and address all forms of violence, including [. . .] all forms of hate speech and discrimination, misinformation and disinformation. [. . .] We commit to, by 2030, [. . .] assess the impact of misinformation and disinformation on the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. [. . .] We further urgently [. . .] [c]all on social media platforms to provide researchers access to data [. . .] to build an evidence base on how to address misinformation and disinformation and hate speech that can inform government and industry policies, standards and best practices The idea that governments and private corporations should form “policies” to address “misinformation and disinformation” might sound reasonable at first, but that all depends upon who decides what constitutes misinformation and disinformation. The UN is clear that misinformation and disinformation incudes information that undermines its policies related to “public health and climate action.” Questioning the global digital transformation that is designed to “advance solutions for the Sustainable Development Goals” threatens “climate action” and is therefore disinformation that governments and private corporations should “counter and address.” Governments around the world are implementing laws and regulations to seize control of the information we can share with that goal in mind. Of course, this could not be more anti-democratic, but governments serve as functional oligarchies not democracies. None of the governments that have passed or intend to pass online censorship laws are the instigators of these policies or legislative moves. They emanate from the global governance of the UN and its agencies where real Orbital Authority is exercised. In Part 1, we discussed NRx technocrat Curtis Yarvin’s metaphorical exploration of global government that he termed “Orbital Authority.” The global transformation of our urban environments is already being propelled by such authority. It is an oligarch-led public-private, or multistakeholder, global governance authority. Oligarch-backed policy think tanks, such as Bloomberg’s CityLab, and the state-funded public-private partnership think tanks, like the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology (CAICT), form the policy and design the corresponding implementation initiatives. The CAICT calls itself “a specialized think-tank for the government and an innovation and development platform for the industry.” The CAICT acts as an “enabler for innovation and development in an information society.” It is a public-private partnership that “plays an important role in strategy and policy” with respect to the digital transformation in China. Chinese state media recently reported China’s official launch of its plan to provide “processing resources across China,” to link City Brains and other smart-city elements together in a “mega computing project” that will create regional data hubs. From the reports, you would imagine that the CPC was leading the rollout. That impression is misleading. It was the CAICT that proposed the concept of the “National Integrated Computing Power and Network Scheduling Platform” that has given rise to the reportedly state-led mega computing project. The CAICT is also a UN partner with an agreement in place to implement the “digital transformation aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals” across Africa. African governments are not designing “Africa’s digital future” any more than China’s government is heading the “digital transformation” in China. The transformation is a global governance agenda, far beyond the influence of any electorate or population, and national governments’ role is merely to create the enabling environment (see Part 1) to establish the resultant global governance. The UN fully backs and promotes this worldwide digital transformation. In addition, the UN has already established global governance structures “in which the city predominates.” This unwavering transformation of the global polity and societal norms is precisely what the NRx technocrats want and are committed to achieving. The Orbital Authority that Curtis Yarvin deems necessary for “thousands of independent sovereign states and city-states” to “flourish” is being constructed by the UN and its multinational corporate “stakeholders.” The UN is predominantly an oligarch-led project. In 2014, professor of international history Ludovic Tournès, writing for The Journal of Modern European History, highlighted the significant influence of the Rockefellers in establishing the United Nations. In the late 1950s, the Rockefeller-funded Special Studies Project began publishing its findings, culminating in the 1961 publication of the full report titled “Prospect for America: The Rockefeller Panel Reports.” Seeking to strengthen UN global governance, The Rockefeller Study Project recommended dividing the world “into smaller units” that would “consist of regional institutions under an international body of growing authority [the UN]” (page 26). The researchers ultimately recommended: The most natural multination arrangements are frequently regional. [. . .] We believe that this regional approach has world-wide validity. [. . .] What is needed immediately is a determination to move in the direction they imply. Regional arrangements are no longer a matter of choice. They are imposed by the requirements of technology, science, and economics. Our course is to contribute to this process by constructive action [pages 188–190]. The idea of a global governance system, based upon a regional balance of power, had been pursued by a trans-Atlantic oligarch network—of which the Rockefellers are leading members—since the early 20th century. As part of the process of “constructive action” to establish this new world order, in 1965 the Rockefellers convened an international conference at their Villa Serbelloni mansion in Bellagio, Italy. Today called the Bellagio Center, the 1965 meeting at the Villa set up the Club of Rome policy think tank which solidified as “a core group of like-minded thinkers” in 1968. In September 1973, the Club of Rome proposed a global governance model that divided the world into ten regions. In their report, titled “Regionalized and Adaptive Model of the Global World System,” they described these global governance regions as “Kingdoms.” The same year, David Rockefeller co-founded the Trilateral Commission policy think tank with US political scientist and policy advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski. Unsurprisingly, the Trilateral Commission claims the authority to “affect [. . .] foreign policy and national security strategies,” across three global regions it calls pillars: North America, Europe, and Asia Pacific. The current model of regional Kingdoms—“pillars” or “poles”—is commonly referred to as multipolarity and the consequent Multipolar World Order (MWO) is said to be in prospect. The Munich Security Conference (MSC) is the premier international public-private security policy conference where predominantly, but not exclusively, Western “decision-makers” meet annually to network and form international defence and security policy. The MSC 2025 report informs us that there is a “changing global distribution of power,” adding that a “multipolar world holds significant promise.” However, it also notes that the new multipolar global governance bureaucracy must not impede “joint approaches to global crises and threats.” The MSC determined that “depolarization [. . .] could set multipolarity on a positive track,” where “depolarization” refers to the process of nations accepting their sociopolitical and perhaps cultural differences but aligning to their respective “poles” in order to address “global crises” through collective action. To explain its “depolarization” point, on behalf of the MSC “decision-makers” it represents, the MSC report referenced the 2023 comments of then German Chancellor Olaf Scholtz who said, in order to “keep multilateralism alive in a multipolar world,” it was essential to maintain “greater participation in, and integration into, the international order.” In other words, depolarization is multipolar decentralisation leading to greater centralisation within the global “order.” This is the same decentralization to recentralization trick (see Part 1) favoured by the NRx technocrats. Depolarization is not transforming global governance by chance. Influential oligarch-led policy think tanks, such as the UK-based Chatham House and its sister organisation, the US Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), have been trying to create the depolarized regional balance of power global governance system for more than a century. The Council on Foreign Relations is among the many Western oligarch-led think tanks to have consistently promoted multipolarity. In 2023, a team of CFR analysts expressed their opinion about what would constitute the perfect “pole” in a Multipolar World Order: The EU [European Union] is a networked union that allows its members to act together in some ways and apart in others. The EU [. . .] has far more power over its members, which remain sovereign states, than any other regional entity. It is one of a kind. [. . .] The EU has developed a template that other regional organizations are following and customizing in various ways. [. . .] Foreign policy practitioners should hope these blocs succeed. Powerful regional unions are the necessary intermediaries between international or global institutions and state and local governments. According to the CFR, the European Union (EU) presents us with the ideal “template” for a MWO pole. Speaking at the 2025 Munich Security Conference, H.E. Wang Yi, Director of the CPC’s Committee Foreign Affairs, stressed that “China has always seen in Europe an important pole in the multipolar world.” China is currently leading the push to create an Asian Union. The CPC and the CFR appear to be in agreement on the perfect “pole.” Though nation-states supposedly remain “sovereign,” the EU-pole exerts “power over its members”—constituent governments. This CFR argument is self-contradictory nonsense. The governments of nation-states cannot possibly be both “sovereign” and, at the same time, subservient to the leadership of their “pole.” It is unconscionable to imagine that the CFR analysts don’t appreciate this point. What they offer is MWO propaganda. The whole point of the regional “pole,” or “union,” is to act as a completely unnecessary “intermediar[y] between international or global institutions and [. . .] governments.” The CFR defines “international or global institutions” as the UN, its specialized agencies, and groups like the International Monetary Fund and the the G20 (Group of Twenty). We have just discussed the G20 Global smart-city Alliance. It embraces stakeholder capitalism, where governments and their private sector partners “make decisions jointly [to] repurpose city assets for the deployment of digital infrastructure.” Given the UN commitment to global governance where “the city predominates,” the discernable nature of the real “Orbital Authority” is materializing. Governments that are functional oligarchies (see Part 1) are being subsumed into regional poles within a Multipolar World Order that has been actively sought by generations of globalist oligarchs. The poles will empower public-private “international organisations”—dominated by private capital (oligarchs)—to set policy for the regional pole’s member state, thereby removing any meaningful expression of national sovereignty. Simultaneously, privately financed smart-city “zones” are being carved out of nation-states as global governance moves toward “collective city decision-making across national borders.” Curtis Yarvin’s “Orbital Authority” was a metaphor, but there is nothing metaphorical about the deliberate, oligarch-led transformation of our world. What they are constructing mirrors the “patchwork” of network states—gov-corp Technates—proposed by the NRx technocrats. The aim is the digital enslavement of humanity to the asserted authority of private capital. Far from resisting this emerging tyranny, governments are willingly hastening the process because they are functional oligarchies. Knowing the kind of feudalistic tyranny they portend, who would ever choose to live in a gov-corp Technate? Unfortunately, millions of the most vulnerable people on earth don’t have much choice regarding where they live and architects of the gov-corp Technates are targetting them to be among their first “customers.” In 2025, the UN High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) reported that refugee migration in 2024 was “driven by conflict, persecution, human rights violations, and instability.” Refugees fled man-made war zones, man-made economic destruction, and man-made persecution—overwhelmingly from countries in the co-called Global South—but there is no sign of people fleeing any climate crisis, anthropogenic or otherwise. Of course, people have to escape natural disasters such as floods and forest fires. But there is no evidence of any upward trend in either the frequency or severity of weather related natural disasters. Again, all too often, we find that the lethal scale of, for example, catastrophic flooding, though undoubtedly caused by extreme weather events, is exacerbated by very poor planning decisions. Nevertheless, as the UNHCR reports, climate change is not a driver of mass migration. Yet, the UN and its partners constantly refer to refugees as largely escaping the “climate crisis.” As there are no climate refugees, the core PR message to the contrary is designed to supposedly justify and facilitate the global governance agenda— the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). That there is no evidence of any climate crisis is irrelevant. Our collective belief in the propaganda is all that matters. Back in 2018, shortly before the UN adopted the Global Compact on Migration, at the annual UN convened Mayoral Forum on Human Mobility, Migration and Development, civic leaders from eighty cities formed the UN’s Mayors Migration Council (MMC). The MMC is a sponsored project of Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisors that aims to make “a tangible difference in the lives of urban migrants, displaced people, and receiving communities worldwide.” It further proclaims that it “accelerates ambitious global action on migration and displacement to create a world where urban migrants, displaced people, and receiving communities can thrive.” NRx technocrat accelerationism (see Part 1) is now enmeshed in all levels of global governance. Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisors openly declares that its “mission is to accelerate philanthropy in pursuit of a just world by providing deep global expertise.” It is easy to imagine that the ubiquitous use of the term “accelerate,” or variations thereof, is just a reflection of in vogue terminology, but it is omnipresent and we would be naive to overlook its ideological significance. The UN outlines its purpose in its associated Global Compact: Our Ambition is to: Accelerate and scale the global collective impact of business by [. . .] delivering the SDGs through accountable companies and ecosystems that enable change. To this end, the UN adds: The United Nations Global Compact is leading Accelerators to embed SDG-aligned practices deep into business operations and across the value chain to accelerate progress and impact for the 2030 Agenda. Available to participating companies of the UN Global Compact, the Accelerators are run in close collaboration with Global Compact Country Networks and are designed with a view to generating behavior change across a large number of companies at the local level – achieving maximum impact and scale. The UN’s Global Compact is a supposedly “non-binding” policy agenda, first adopted by the United Nations in 2000. The Compact is not focused on intergovernmental cooperation and has virtually nothing to do with nation-states. The UN describes it as “the world’s largest corporate sustainability project.” Agenda 21 is also a non-binding “plan of action” that, in 1992, laid the foundations for the global sustainable development. The Agenda 21 global policy agenda has shaped the lives of nearly everyone on earth in subsequent years. The UN coordinates policy globally and calling its policy agendas “non-binding” is meaningless if the public sector and the private sector rigidly adhere to them. The UN is determined to create “global governance in which the city predominates.” Consequently, the MMC has been empowered by the UN to “influence policy decisions at the national and international level.” As NRx technocrat accelerationism pervades pretty much everything the UN does, the MMC says that it “accelerates global action on migration and displacement.” The MMC has established task forces with other city-state networks, C40 for example, to manage the migration caused by the climate crisis, irrespective of the fact that the UN concedes there are no climate refugees. In addition, as far as the MMC is concerned, international relations based on Westphalian sovereignty is a “broken system” and it has therefore created the financial pathway for investors to directly fund city-state plans for refugees. The MMC’s Global Cities Fund for Migrants and Refugees is set to transform the broken system by directly funding city-states. The Cities Fund offers international donors an investment “pipeline” to circumvent national governments and directly channel “international resources to city governments.” This is to enable “city governments and their local partners to implement projects of their own design.” The focus of the investment is to support “city governments” to manage “their migrant and displaced communities.” The investment pipeline will create a “a marketplace of city-led solutions” and the reason for all of this is to ensure the UN’s “Global Compacts for Migration” is implemented. The UN claims that its Global Compact on Migration (GCM) is grounded in the “values of state sovereignty.” As we have just discussed, there is scant evidence of that. Instead, the Global Compact seeks to apply a “common approach to international migration in all its dimensions.” Those dimensions are encapsulated in the twenty-three GCM Objectives. The first Objective is to harvest as much data as possible from refugees and economic migrants. The third is to develop systems for the sharing of that data with stakeholders. This accompanies Objective 4, which seeks to force “all migrants [to] have proof of legal identity,” by which the UN means digital ID. At the city or “municipal” level, the UN wants to use migrants to implement digital ID as a means of exclusion: Build upon existing practices at the local level that facilitate participation in community life, such as interaction with authorities and access to relevant services, through the issuance of registration cards to all persons living in a municipality, including migrants, that contain basic personal information. That is to say, everyone’s “participation in community life” and everyone’s access to services will be contingent on you having a UN-approved, compatible digital ID. As we have repeatedlydiscussed, the UN’s own research clearly shows that there is no climate crisis-related immigration. Objective 2 is focused upon “minimising the drivers” of migration flows but identifies virtually none but the alleged migration impacts of the so-called climate crisis. Of the twelve clauses to Objective 2, just one briefly mentions “conflict” but only to the extent of “taking into consideration relevant recommendations from State-led consultative processes, such as the Guidelines to Protect Migrants in Countries Experiencing Conflict.” Despite knowing full well that people have to flee from war, persecution, and poverty, not climate change, the UN’s GCM, supposedly designed to assist the dispossessed and the most vulnerable refugees, has practically nothing to say about tackling any of the actual underlying causes of their plight. Even objective 7, to “reduce vulnerabilities in migration,” says nothing about persecution, impoverishment, or conflict. Instead it insists upon providing refugees with “identification,” presumably because humanitarian assistance simply cannot be provided otherwise. Refugee children should be added to national identity systems and “stakeholders” should be fully engaged in the child’s identification process. The unmistakable purpose of the UN’s GCM “Objectives” is to exploit immigration to cement the UN’s global governance agenda. This is starkly highlighted by “Objective 19: Create conditions for migrants and diasporas to fully contribute to sustainable development in all countries.” The UN wants to “harness the benefits of migration as a source of sustainable development.” The main goal is to: Ensure the full and effective implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development [. . .] by fostering and facilitating the positive effects of migration for the realization of all Sustainable Development Goals The UN’s marked lack of any genuine concern for the predicament of refugees is bad enough but, when we then consider who it chooses as its “partners” to assist with its planned migration, the reality that dawns is stomach churning. Titus Gebel is the former Chairman of the Board of the Patri Friedman’s Seasteading Institute—a joint project between Peter Thiel and Friedman—and a partner at NeWay Capital. He is the founder of Tipolis Inc and a leading investor in and legal advisor to Próspera, having previously acted as a legal advisor for the Honduran government’s original ZEDE program (see Part 1). In 2018, Gebel published Free Private Cities: Making Governments Compete For You. His book outlines how private corporations—i.e. Yarvin’s sovcorps—can provide “government as a service.” He suggested that customers should sign a contract in return for the governance they receive from their sovcorp. Governance providers, in various city-states, would compete for customers (citizens) who would be free to leave, subject to contract, if they didn’t like the private government service on offer in their zone (gov-corp Technate). It seems Gebel essentially plagiarised the NRx technocrat’s ideas, first put forward by Curtis Yarvin and Nick Land about a decade before Gebel took credit for his supposedly “completely new” gov-corp Technate model. Clearly an NRx technocrat, Gebel established Tripolis Inc—in the tax haven of Singapore—in order to create new models of innovative governance. Via Tripolis Inc, Gebel, and his coterie of angel investor partners, hope to become the “owner[s] and operator[s]” of their own International Cities: International Cities are privately run communities, based on clear contracts, which provide, enable and facilitate opportunity and choice. International Cities will be established at multiple locations around the world. [. . .] International Cities build on the concept of Special Administrative Regions (SARs) and are the next evolution of Special Economic Zones (SEZs). [. . .] International Cities will be thriving hubs of business and innovation. Special Administrative Regions (SARs) were formulated by the Chinese government under Deng Xiaoping as part of its “one country, two systems” policy. Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan were legally designated SARs by the Chinese government in the early 1980s. The intention was to provide regulatory autonomy to hopefully reunified territories, though Taiwan has yet to commit to reunification. That Gebel considers the larger SARs as “the next evolution” of SEZs speaks to the territorial ambitions of those pursuing the city-state agenda. Gebel is also an advisor to the Swiss-based Andan Foundation led by its founder Dr Christian H. Kälin (or Kaelin). The Andan Foundations explains its purpose: Andan leads private sector initiatives to support families fleeing their homes due to war, internal conflict, and climate change. It identifies and develops innovative, sustainable solutions. [. . .] Andan prioritizes projects that expand economic, financial, and political opportunities for both refugee populations and the communities that welcome them. Andan facilitates and propels partnerships between the private sector and UN agencies, governments, NGOs, and academic institutions concerned with refugees and migrants. Andan proposes a business that capitalises on the “opportunities” presented by refugees, asylum seekers and economic migrants. The Foundation adds that its “main, long-term project is the Andan Free Global City project—or “International City” as Gebel would call it—which it says has the potential to “completely upend and reform how we deal with the growing global refugee and migration crisis”: Today, the world is spending billions of dollars each year in dead-end, protracted refugee management with camps and urban settings. [. . .] We aim at no less than completely turn around the way we look at refugees and migrants. [. . .] What we need is again a safe harbour, a new place where refugees and other migrants forced to leave their homes receive the opportunity to live. [. . .] We need free Global Cities – autonomous, self-governed subnational entities that provide a safe environment. [. . .] We are also actively engaged with several governments around the world, as well as with a few major investors who are prepared to finance the establishment of the first free Global City, which will also provide a decent return on capital from private investors. Kälin, an advisor to the Swiss government among others, suggests reading a 2022 article by Albert Steck to really get a feel for what he, Gebel and other international NRx technocrats are proposing: [Kälin] sees his Andan Global City not only as a humanitarian project, but also as a profitable business idea. [. . .] In Kälin’s city [refugees] would be motivated workers and founders of businesses. [. . .] [Kälin is] in talks with representatives of the U.N. and the World Economic Forum. [. . .] The biggest challenge is finding a country that will provide an uninhabited or sparsely populated territory for an autonomous city, he says. [. . .] Initially, several tens of thousands of people could live there – with the prospect that it might ultimately become a city of millions. Private financing is therefore crucial to the success of such a large project, says entrepreneur Titus Gebel. [. . .] Gebel, who was born in Germany, is also the founder of the Free Cities Foundation, which works to establish special economic zones in various countries, following the example of Shenzhen in China or the European free cities in the Middle Ages. Like all NRx technocrat fronts, the Andan Foundation staunchly advocates digital ID and suggests that blockchain “has the potential to create new solutions for refugee and identification systems” and that digital ID, stored on a unified ledger, should be “directly accessible to refugees and immigrants.” Once the refugee’s digital twin is operational, the refugees can serve as “motivated workers” in the Free Global City—gov-corp Technate. Presumably, should they be insufficiently motivated, their access to money and food “could be frozen” and they could be “locked out of all doors” to essential services until they rediscover the correct motivation. Christian Kälin is also the Chairman of Henley & Partners, a UK based consultancy that specialises in a lucrative venture which Kälin claims to have “pioneered.” Henley & Partners touts itself as “the world’s foremost experts in investment migration and citizenship-by-investment.” Serving a clientele of “internationally mobile entrepreneurs and investors,” Henley & Partners (H&P) says that it helps “high-net-worth and ultra-high-net-worth individuals” to obtain “bespoke residence and citizenship by investment.” Essentially, Kälin and H&P advises “ultra-high-net-worth individuals”—including oligarchs—where to invest in order to buy residency visas and citizenship and then manages the application process for them. The history of “citizenship-by-investment” (CBI) schemes is not very edifying. For example, Paolo Zampolli, President Trump’s global envoy for special partnerships, was evidently involved in a seemingly corrupt CBI scheme that sold Dominican Republic residency to Chinese billionaires, such as Ng Lap Seng, who were under investigation by the UN for bribing UN officials. John Ashe, the former president of the UN General Assembly, was also suspected of involvement but died in an extremely bizarre bar-bell “accident” shortly before he was due to testify in the case. Kälin has been dubbed the “Passport King” for his pioneering efforts in the CBI field. However, according to US-based Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP), H&P has been involved in numerous corrupt CBI schemes. For instance, in the Caribbean nation of the Federation of Saint Kitts and Nevis between 2006 and 2013. The St. Kitts and Nevis Sugar Industry Diversification Foundation (SIDF) was “set up in 2006 to move the island economy away from dependence on sugar.” The SIDF turned agricultural land into development land. The purchase of territory was funded by the government and H&P’s “high-net-worth” clients seeking residency in St. Kitts and Nevis, many of whom had criminal ties or were wanted in various jurisdictions. Money from the SIDF fund was then directed to invest in companies that Kälin was closely associated with. H&P insisted there was no conflict of interest. The SIDF became inoperative around 2017 and, with important agricultural land lost and no sign of any return on the government’s SIDF investment, the OCCRP noted that the “ultimate losers were the people of St. Kitts and Nevis.” Kälin was seemingly the financier behind the Strategic Communications Laboratories Group’s (SCL’s) 2010 re-election campaign for then St. Kitts and Nevis Prime Minister Denzil Douglas. In 2018, an interim UK parliamentary investigatory report issued by the powerful Digital, Media, Culture and Sports Committee (DMCSC) noted: 211. We were told, behind much of SCL Elections’ campaigning work was the hidden hand of Christian Kalin, Chairman of Henley and Partners, who arranged for investors to supply the funding to pay for campaigns, and then organised SCL to write their manifesto and oversee the whole campaign process. In exchange [. . .] Henley and Partners would gain exclusive passport rights for that country, under a citizenship-by-investment (CBI) programme.[. . .] Christian Kalin [has] been described as having a ‘Faustian pact’. With the exclusive passport rights came a government that would be conducive to Mr. Kalin and his clients. The British defence contractor SCL is the parent company of the notorious Cambridge Analytica (CA)that was widely accused of manipulating the 2016 US presidential elections and the UK “BREXIT” referendum on leaving the European Union (EU). The CA operation also illegitimately acquired the data of millions of Facebook users. Hence, the UK parliamentary investigation. CA, and thus SCL, is evidently connected to Peter Thiel’s Palantir. As CA’s suspected election manipulation, and what was tantamount to data theft, came under international scrutiny, Palantir disavowed that connection. But, when the New York Times revealed that one of its employees—Palantir business manager Alfredas Chmieliauskas—had worked with CA to form “behavioural profiles” of voting social media users, Palantir changed its statement and said Mr Chmieliauskas was not acting on Palantir’s behalf at the time, though he was a Palantir employee throughout the period. H&P’s CBI schemes were not limited to the Caribbean. They have reportedly been found to be wholly corrupt in Cyprus, for instance. When, in 2017, Maltese investigative journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia started to expose H&B’s involvement in Malta’s corrupt Individual Investor Programme (IIP)—Malta’s CBI scheme—subsequent inquiry hearings revealed emails indicating that H&P instigated a Strategic Lawsuits against Public Participation (SLAPP) against her. It seems H&P intended to file the lawsuit in the UK because they wanted a “sympathetic judge.” Daphne Caruana Galizia, who was also instrumental in reporting the Panama Papers, was assassinated in a car bombing in Malta in October 2017. More recently, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) has ruled the Maltese CBI scheme illegal. As an EU member state, a Maltese passport provided some questionable “ultra-high-income individuals” with EU citizenship. It is not without justification that the ECJ characterised CBI schemes, including those run by H&B, as making “the acquisition of nationality a mere commercial transaction.” Kälin, who conceded that some H&B clients were “problem[s]” who fell through H&B’s claimed “due diligence” checks, was undeterred by the ECJ ruling. He was enthused by the global expansion of CBI schemes and, in particular, the Trump administration’s plan to issue permanent residency visas to anyone who can afford the $5 million price tag. If he wants to move to the US, Kälin could certainly afford a US “gold card.” Fours years earlier, In 2021, numerous hedge funds faced potential ruin as a result of the GameStop short squeeze. When Reddit users noticed the mass shorting of stock in the the GameStop chain of high-street stores, they apparently spiked demand for the stock and pushed the price up by coordinating large-scale stock purchases. Thus leaving those with short positions—betting the stock price would fall—exposed to enormous losses. Through his company Arnova Capital, Christian Kälin consequently made a fortune on the GameStop stock his company held. He also accurately predicted, before any WHO announcement of a worldwide pandemic, that energy prices would soar during the pseudopandemic. Kälin’s 2000% ROI on his initial investment in Arnova Capital is truly remarkable. The Andan Foundation, founded by Kälin and advised by Gebel, that seeks to profit from refugee migration by establishing Free Global Cities, is a “long-standing” partner of the United Nations. The goal of the partnership is to “propel and facilitate the private sector’s involvement,” in managing international refugee migration with a view to create “public and private initiatives that create long-term solutions for refugees.” The appalling stench of neocolonialism exudes from every part of the UN’s global migration policy agenda. The oligarch-led UN public-private partnership is implementing a strategy that aims to exploit migrants and refugees to achieve UN objectives. There is no serious attempt to do anything to address the problems that cause mass migration. The migrant is simply a “human resource” to be identified, stamped and relocated into communities the world over in order to achieve UN policy targets. The UN wants to construct a global network smart-city gov-corp Technates because that too will better facilitate the rollout of its global governance; it has formed partnerships with NRx technocrats who want to use the displaced as a workforce and who view refugee “residency” in their gov-corp Technates as a “profitable business idea;” the UN is supporting and encouraging the national governments to hand over territory to oligarch investors in preparation for its New Urban Agenda, and the UN wants all lives, including those of refugees and economic migrants, to be controlled by digital technology linked to the digital ID of their digital twin. The networks, technological systems, and investment “pipelines” are in place to enable gov-corp Technate ultra-high-net-worth “founders” to buy citizenship, should they wish, and set up gov-corp Technates either by investing in SEZs or smart-city developments already underway. In 2024, the UNHCR estimated that there were 123.2 million displaced people seeking refuge. Clearly, NRx technocrats like Titus Gebel and Christian Kälin hope to provide said refuge for a profitable return. In 2023, on the US election campaign trail, calling it a “quantum leap,” Donald Trump proposed initially constructing ten “Freedom Cities” in the US. As reported by Bloomberg: The end game is audacious: High-tech company towns free from state law and most federal rules—including the Internal Revenue Code, major environmental laws like the Clean Water Act and the Endangered Species Act; worker protections like the Fair Labor Standards Act and the Occupational Health and Safety Act; and the Affordable Care Act. There are currently around 300 SEZs in the US and the potential for expansion of the Freedom City concept in the US is already marked. The Freedom City idea, though it provides the same SEZ regulatory advantages to multinational corporations, stands apart somewhat from other SEZ initiatives. The Freedom Cities will be constructed on parcels of US territory sold-off directly to private investors. Initially, the Trump administration tried to sell-off US territory to oligarchs through public land sale provisions included in Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill. Due to public and political opposition, the public land sale clauses were removed prior to the Bill passing. The NRx technocrats behind the Trump administration are, however, determined. They are now trying to use Trump’s proposed Sovereign Wealth Fund (SWF) for the same purpose. Inherent in the US SWF plan is the intention to liquidate—sell-off—US public land (territory) to raise capital. It remains to be seen if this line of attack will work where the Big Beautiful Bill assault failed. There is a powerful international network, led by US NRx technocrats, exploring every avenue to get the gov-corp Technates—Freedom Cities—built in the US. Peter Thiel protégé, and an NRx technocrat in his own right, Sam Altman, stood close to Oracle’s Larry Ellison, SoftBank’s Masayoshi Son and President Trump when Trump announced his administration’s Stargate Project. According to Altman’s OpenAI: The Stargate Project is a new company which intends to invest $500 billion over the next four years building new AI infrastructure for OpenAI in the United States. [. . .] The initial equity funders in Stargate are SoftBank, OpenAI, Oracle, and MGX. SoftBank and OpenAI are the lead partners for Stargate, with SoftBank having financial responsibility and OpenAI having operational responsibility. Masayoshi Son will be the chairman. Arm, Microsoft, NVIDIA, Oracle, and OpenAI are the key initial technology partners. [. . .] All of us look forward to continuing to build and develop AI—and in particular AGI [artificial generative intelligence]—for the benefit of all of humanity. We believe that this new step is critical on the path, and will enable creative people to figure out how to use AI to elevate humanity. “All of us” refers to the global NRx technocrat community of which Sam Altman, Larry Ellison, and Masayoshi Son (Masayoshi Yasumoto) are members. The intention to use AI to “elevate humanity” means to meld us with technology and turn is into programmable “technoplastic beings.” Masayoshi Son is the head of the technology investment holding company SoftBank Group (SBG) which has capitalised handsomely on its investments in Chinese technology firms such as Alibaba. This is largely due to its control of the Chinese social media firm TikTok, ByteDance, the largest social media company in the world by revenue, is currently valued at around $330 billion. This makes SoftBank’s 4% stake in ByteDance worth roughly $13.2 billion. It remains to be seen if Larry Ellison’s $14 billion deal to buy out ByteDance’ stake in TikTok’s US operation will help Masayoshi Son’s to increase his ByteDance holdings. Certainly, it should provide him with a healthy dividend. Trump has spoken about “four or five world-class investors” profiting from the deal, but both he and Ellison have been coy about officially naming them. Project Stargate was launched to much fanfare, in keeping with the rhetoric in the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025, as the US was supposedly set on a course to outcompete China’s DeepSeek AI development program, which is key to the Hangzhou City-Brain project. Closer scrutiny of Stargate, however, brings the whole notion of competition into question. Prior to the Stargate launch, in September 2024, Blackrock, its owned subsidiary Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), Microsoft, and MGX announced their Global AI Infrastructure Investment Partnership (GAIIP) to to fuel AI innovation. This was a worldwide venture but there was a focus on supporting AI innovation in the US. The GAIIP implementing partners included NVIDIA. As a founding member of GAIIP, UAE-based AI investor MGX is also a “lead partner” in Stargate. MGX is owned by the sovereign wealth fund (Mubadala) of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi ruled by former UAE president Sheik Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan. Shortly after the January 2025 launch of Stargate, in February, Sam Altman visited Abu Dhabi to discuss finance for Stargate with MGX. This resulted in an initial, accelerated $6.6 billion Stargate start-up investment round. BlackRock, and notably its GIP, receive billions of dollars of private equity investment from China’s state-run investment arms such as the State Administration of Foreign Assets and the China Investment Corporation (CIC). As Trump ramped up his allegedly tough competitive stance against China, by April 2025 the Chinese financiers were pulling back on their enormous US private equity commitments. Doubtless, this was much to the chagrin of Blackrock, MGX and other GAIIP partners. DeepSeek AI developers in China were reliant on the US-based multinational NVIDIA’s H20 processors which are manufactured under license in Taiwan. NVIDIA is a “key technology partner” of Stargate. Having initially “banned” H20 sales to China, reportedly following some meetings with Jensen Huang—co-founder and CEO of GAIIP partner NVIDIA—the Trump administration started lifting the H20 export ban, more or less as soon as it had been imposed, in April 2025. This later became the official position as, it seems, the initial ban was a mistake. In May 2025, Trump was dispatched to Abu Dhabi where he signed a deal to supply US AI-chips, including NVIDIA processors, to the Abu Dhabi AI digital transformation hub. An associated agreement was made for US tech firms to collaborate on AI development in the Emirate and the wider UAE. Trump called the deal the “U.S.-U.A.E. A.I. Acceleration Partnership.” In what was clearly a deal sweetener, just a couple of weeks prior to the Trump-UAE deal, Steve Witkoff, Trump’s Middle East envoy, met Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan in Sardinia. Sheik Tahnoon is the Abu Dhabi Emir’s brother, UAE National Security Advisor, and CEO of MGX (Mubadala). Sheik Tahnoon agreed to invest $2 billion in World Liberty Financial, a cryptocurrency venture owned by the Witkoff and Trump families. Though this looks like blatant corruption, the official fact-checkers have declared everything unimpeachable and have defined the truth for us. Any suggestions that this chain of events clearly evidences high level political corruption have all been officially labelled as “baseless rumours.” Fact-checking heavyweight Snopes reliably informed us: While the two deals happened within two weeks and there was an overlap of people who were involved in them, there was no evidence the first, between MGX and World Liberty Financial, was a direct bribe for the second deal, which involved the chips. So, thankfully, the approved fact-checkers have answered all of our questions for us and that’s an end to the matter. In the media-spun war of words, and that is evidently all it is, China has now reportedly banned the import of the NVIDIA RTX Pro 6000D—the successor to the H20. But China doesn’t need to import processors from the US because the UAE-China AI partnership, specifically the Abu Dhabi digital transformation hub, has a Trump administration agreement in place for the supply of the processors and it serves as a “crucial base for Chinese AI firms.” The purported Stargate “competition” with DeepSeek AI looks more like a “partnership.” So what else might be going on here? When Forbes reported the launch of Stargate on January 2025, its journalists said the “details of the venture are unclear at this early stage.” Why they made this claim is perplexing. The details were not unclear. In November 2024, Sam Altman’s OpenAI, the driving force behind Stargate, announced its “blueprint for U.S. AI infrastructure.” AI in America: OpenAI’s Economic Blueprint, is Stargate mapped out. This was published before the official White House Stargate announcement and there was no need for any journalist to be “unclear” about any aspect of it. The “Blueprint” talks about the need to merge “private-sector vision and innovation with public-sector enlightenment to unlock the new technology;” a plan for “building the infrastructure needed to produce enough energy;” investment to develop “the next generation of energy technology, including sustainable sources such as fission, fusion, and other promising technologies;” and it notes the need for “common-sense rules” to help “innovators thrive by encouraging investment [. . .] and greater freedom.” The NRx technocrat “Blueprint” also defines the alleged need for Freedom Cities: We need a foundational strategy to ensure that investment in infrastructure benefits the most people possible and maximizes access to AI. This includes policies and initiatives that encourage rather than stifle developers; support a thriving AI-ready workforce and ecosystems of labs, start-ups and larger companies; and secure America’s leadership on AI into the future, such as: AI Economic Zones, created by local, state and the federal government together with industry, that significantly speed up the permitting processes for building AI infrastructure like new solar arrays, wind farms and nuclear reactors. These will be what Bloomberg calls “towns free from state law and most federal rules.” Just as the plan for Freedom Cities in the US preceded Stargate, the UK’s deal with Blackrock to develop “freeports” in the UK (see Part 1) had preceded the rollout of the NRx technocrats’ UK Stargate project. It is the same NRx technocrat network imposing the same SEZ-based independent jurisdiction model wherever you look. Mark Lutter, for example, serves on the board of the Frontier Foundation that was set up to promote the Freedom City initiative in the US. As we discussed in Part 1, Lutter is also the founder and Executive Director of the Charter Cities Institute which states it is proud to support the development of Freedom Cities in the US.Titus Gebel, who wants to profit from migrants and refugees, works closely with Lutter. As previously noted, Lutter served as the head economist for NeWAY Capital and Gebel is a NeWay Capital Partner. Nick Allen, President of the Frontier Foundation and Lutter’s colleague, is very eager to make use of Trump’s SWF grift and toldWIREDthat federal land close to cities like Boise, Idaho; Grand Junction, Colorado; and Redmond, Oregon would be great places to build gov-corp Technates. Speaking on behalf of the Frontier Foundation, Allen added: If we’re able to get a legislative transfer of land from the US government to make a public-private partnership, or a trust, or even a private corporation, then it’s a lower cost of capital. [. . .] There’s so much capital and there’s so much political will, but yet there’s an inability to develop these [frontier] technologies. And the inability comes from lack of space and too many regulations. NeWay capital established the Freedom Cities Coalition (FCC) which promotes the idea of Freedom Cities as “Cities Without Limits.” This means towns and cities where there are no regulation and oligarchs are free to do what they please. In addition to NeWay Capital, the FCC is also backed by Pronomos Capital led by NRx Technocrats Peter Thiel, Marc Andreessen, and Joe Lonsdale. The FCC claims that Freedom Cities or, in Stargate terminology, “AI Economic Zones,” represent “America’s boldest solution to unleash our nation’s full potential.” They will be constructed in “zones of regulatory clarity” which will be “specially designated areas” where “entrepreneurs” can “move at the speed of human ingenuity” without having to bother with any overbearing federal laws or regulations. The FCC adds: Freedom Cities are more than just economic zones. [. . .] Imagine communities where housing is abundant and affordable, [. . .] where breakthrough technologies move from lab to market at lightning speed because innovators are free to innovate. This is how we’ll overcome stagnation, outcompete China, and create a new American century. Freedom Cities give us the chance to prove once again what Americans can achieve when we’re unshackled from outdated systems and empowered to build the future. With regard to where the Freedom Cities will be built, the FCC notes: 28% Of US land is federally owned and ready for innovative development. If the Trump administration’s SWF plans proceed, this will open the door for NRx technocrats and other oligarchs to buy up US territory to build their gov-corp Technates. The political will certainly appears to be there. Trump’s long-time economic advisor Stephen Moore supports the city-state model. Moore is the former chief economist at the Heritage Foundation, which was behind Project 2025’s Promise to America. The Trump administration came to power promising to tackle the pernicious influence of “American elites” and was therefore eager to distance itself from the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025 “Promise,” which was funded by the Koch and Bradley families, among other so-called American elites. Regardless, most of Trump’s Executive Orders, issued when he came to power for the second time, were practically written by the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025. The same group of American elites are also behind the State Policy Network (SPN) that proposed the “Compact For America” shortly before Trump’s first US election win in 2016. What Trump termed Freedom Cities in 2023, the Compact for America, whose National Spokesman was Stephen Moore, called Prosperity Districts in 2015. The terminology has changed, but the intention to create gov-corp Technates in the US has not. As we discussed in Part 1, just as the “authority” is formed to oversee the independent jurisdiction of a Special Economic Zone (SEZ), so the Prosperity District (PD) would be the authority that rules within the jurisdictional boundaries permitted by amenable “Prosperity States” within the US. Once approved, the PD would wield policing powers, it would control all “municipal services” through public-private partnerships, and set all regulations within its jurisdiction. Just as with the “authority” ruling an SEZ, the PD would expand by petitioning the willing State to expand itself: The formation or expansion of the PD replaces, within its boundaries, all state laws above the baseline of the state constitution, common law, criminal law and existing compacts. The PDs created within Prosperity States liberate residents, transforming states into strongholds of free markets, federalism and limited government once again. Safe to say, Trump did not come up with the notion of the Freedom City. It is simply the rebranding for the oligarchs’ Prosperity District idea. The gov-corp Technate has been the NRx technocrat’s favoured path to corporate “prosperity” and social control for more than a decade at this point. During its first term, the Trump administration tried to put Stephen Moore on the board of the Federal Reserve to ensure favourable monetary policy suited to the formation of Prosperity Districts. The Democratic wing of the Establishment reacted strongly against Moore’s possible appointment and the bid did not succeed. With their second Trump term underway, the NRx Technocrats—the Silicon Valley-based new breed of American elites—have joined forces with their more traditional oligarch partners for the same ends: to build Freedom Cities, Prosperity Districts, SEZs, gov-corp Technates, call them what you like. The US intelligence community is also onboard. This isn’t surprising given that NRx technocrat’s corporations, such as Peter Thiel’s Palantir and Larry Ellison’s Oracle, have deep ties with US intelligence. America’s Frontier Fund (AFF), is a supposedly a “nonprofit” venture capital operation with a nonprofit foundation, backed by Bilderbergers Eric Schmidt and Peter Thiel. The AFF is essentially an impact investment cut-out of the US intelligence and national security apparatus. It was founded and is currently led by Gilman Louie. He is the “former” CEO of the CIA’s investment arm In-Q-Tel (1999 – 2006) and thereafter acted as a defence, national security and intelligence advisor for the US government. Notably, Louie was at the helm of In-Q-Tel when it “accelerated” the startup called Palantir. The AFF’s aim is to harness the “promise of frontier technology.” This is the same “frontier technology” that the UN’s “New Urban Agenda” is based upon, with a view of constructing smart city-states the world over. It is not a coincidence that it is also precisely the same “frontier technology” that the NRx technocrats behind the AFF want to use to enslave humanity. It is, after all, part of the same, global gov-corp Technate plan. The global agenda, moving us toward digital slavery, is impregnable and is not something any of us can vote are way out of. Our only realistic option is not to comply with the adoption of the “smart” frontier technology people like Gilman Louie, and his intelligence linked network of NRx technocrats want us to adopt. This entire, global, gov-corp Technate project could not be more anti-democratic. The Dark Enlightenment and the Technocracy favoured by the NRx technocrats represent the zenith of totalitarian ideology. Their oligarch partners enthusiasm to adopt the same Patchwork of city-states is equally born from the desire to control everyone and everything. Schmidt, Thiel, and Louie were instrumental in setting up the AFF under the previous Biden administration. It would be a mistake to imagine the global agenda to entrap us in smart city-states is a partisan issue. The squabbles we see, such as Democrat opposition to the appointment of Moore to the Fed, are just that: petty squabbles among the ranks. In 2024, the Future Union, which seeks to “fuse private sector capitalism” with political authority, declared Gilman Louie the “top investor supporting democracy.” Louie narrowly pipped other egalitarian, democracy-loving NRx technocrat investors, like Peter Thiel, Eric Shmidt, and Marc Andreessen, to the top prize. Were the intention of their accelerationist investment strategies not so malevolent we could perhaps laugh at the irony.

A MAN HAS been found guilty of the murder of 47 year old man whose skeletal remains were found in a jute bag at a ravine in rural east Cork. The jury of ten men and two women spent just under five hours deliberating at the Central Criminal Court sitting in Cork before finding Niall Long (33) guilty of the murder of Kieran Quilligan, who remains were discovered in Whitewell, Rostellan, Co Cork on January 29th 2024. They will resume their deliberations in relation to his co accused Luke Taylor (27) tomorrow morning. The two accused went on trial earlier this month charged with the murder of Mr Quilligan who was last seen alive on 1 September, 2023. He had been missing for five months when his remains were detected by gardai who had brought a cadaver dog to scrubland in East Cork. In his closing speech to the jury Prosecution senior counsel, Donal O’Sullivan said that Kieran Quilligan was “lured” to his death. He stated that Taylor brought him to a laneway at St Finbarr’s Place in Cork city on 1 September 2023 where he and Long “ambushed” him. O’Sullivan said that the men then threw Kieran Quilligan in to the boot of a car. He said that the “instigating factor” in relation to what occurred involved Kieran Quilligan stealing drugs from Niall Long earlier that day. “Following a robbery by Kieran Quilligan on Niall Long Luke Taylor lures Kieran Quilligan to a lane. He is ambushed by the two of them. He is put in the boot of the car. `They go straight to Little Island (in Co Cork) to a laneway. Down the laneway to a farm. They go down to a nice quiet spot. They are heading home twenty minutes later. What is going on? When the skeletal remains are found there are 19 broken bones, some showing use of an implement like a hammer. Luke Taylor lured Kieran Quilligan to his death. They ambushed him. He was disposed of down that lane.” O’Sullivan said that the body was removed from Little Island three days later and dumped in East Cork. He added that but for the incredible investigative work by gardai the remains would never have been found. Advertisement The jury also heard evidence from Assistant State Pathologist, Dr Margaret Bolster, who carried out a postmortem on the remains of Quilligan at Cork University Hospital. Bolster indicated that an exact cause of death could not be established because decomposition had led to the loss of organs. However, she stated that what was not at doubt was that the injuries suffered by Quilligan were consistent with a “severe assault in a laneway.” Those injuries included fractures to his ribs, chest, leg and hand bones, jaw bones, neck and skull. Bolster said whilst the remains were skeletonised there was a small piece of skin remaining which consisted of a tattoo with the word “mother” and a date. An inscription was illegible. The skull was separate from the body and there was a large amount of silt and vegetation. Bolster also described her examination of the body at the scene. She described going down a ravine off a roadway where there was a jute bag. Underneath this was another jute bag with a “pelvic bone protruding.” The pathologist said she could see ribs and a skull with a “bag around it tied with a knot.” Bolster indicated that the cable tie around the left ankle and right shin and two knotted pieces of plastic around the neck were likely to have been used for the purposes of moving the body. The jury also heard evidence from Sgt Maurice O’Connor who was responsible for analysing mobile phones seized during the course of the investigation. O’Connor gave evidence to the effect that Niall Long had sent a text message to his mother Janice Long on 2 September, 2023. She has texted him saying that her jeep smelled of Dettol. The garda sergeant said that Long texted his mother. In his reply he stated that the boot of the car was cleaned because “the fella that robbed me got a hiding and was thrown in the boot after.” The jury heard evidence from forty seven witnesses. Prosecution counsel Donal O’Sullivan noted that the jury had watched a “staggering amount” of CCTV footage. Over the course of three days of the trial they watched 433 video clips. The charge facing both accused was the murder was carried out on a date unknown between 1 September, 2023 and 29 January, 2024, at an unknown location within the state of the District Court area of Cork city. Niall Long is formerly of St Michael’s Close in Mahon in Cork whilst Luke Taylor is previously of Cherry Lawn in Blackrock in Cork city.

A man has been found guilty of the murder of a 47-year-old man whose skeletal remains were found in a jute bag at a ravine in Whitewell, Rostellan, Co Cork on 29 January 2024.

The jury heard evidence from 47 witnesses. Mr O’Sullivan noted that the jury had watched a "staggering amount" of CCTV footage. Over the course of three days of the trial they watched 433 video clips. The charge facing both accused was the murder was carried out on a date unknown between 1 September 2023 and 29 January 2024, at an unknown location within the State of the District Court area of Cork city. © RTÉ 2025.

Title: Vanguard Gets the VOO Proxy Vote Out

Soon, ETF shareholders may opt for proxy policies that could support (or oppose) issues like the $1 trillion Tesla pay package for Elon Musk. Emile Hallez emile@thedailyupside.com Investors in the world’s biggest ETF will soon be able to say how they want their shares voted in proxies, such as one for the world’s largest pay package for the world’s richest person. Starting next year, Vanguard is extending its 500 Index Fund, including the VOO ETF, to its Investor Choice program, which gives fund investors a handful of proxy voting options. Those include a policy to follow corporate board recommendations, a third-party advisor’s policy aimed at maximizing wealth, one to mirror other shareholders’ votes, one directed by Vanguard and another following ESG recommendations. That latter is offered by Glass Lewis, which along with fellow proxy advisor ISS, recommended opposing a proposed 10-year total compensation package for Tesla CEO Elon Musk that could be worth nearly $1 trillion and increase his proportional ownership in the company. That’s almost as much as Vanguard’s 500 Index Fund, which sits at about $1.4 trillion. Vanguard, along with other massive firms like BlackRock and State Street, rolled out policy voting guidelines a few years ago. “This is also a way for Vanguard to address the issue of its size. Regulators (and critics) have raised concerns about Vanguard’s significant stake in corporate America and questioned how it uses that influence and voting power,” said Jeff DeMaso, editor of The Independent Vanguard Adviser. “This program lets Vanguard deflect those criticisms: Vanguard can say it’s not ‘controlling’ how all of its shares are voted, it’s letting individual investors direct its votes.” Regardless, it can be seen as a win for the company and for fund shareholders, DeMaso said. A look at Vanguard’s Investor Choice program, which is in its fourth year: One Voice, Many Votes: It would be overwhelming, if not nearly impossible, for individual fund investors to direct how their shares are voted for every issue at every company, hence the need for broad policies. “Central to Vanguard Investor Choice is the core belief that investors should have the option to express a preference for how their index fund holdings vote,” Global Head of Investment Stewardship John Galloway said in a statement, adding that the goal is adding it to all the company’s US equity index funds. Either one of these popular tax-advantaged strategies can help clients diversify and defer tax bills, but they can be complex as well as costly. Some of the largest S&P 500-based funds lost billions this year as institutional investors sought out cheaper alternatives. The rare earths industry is booming as the materials are used less in electric vehicles and more in AI data centers. Asset managers have repurposed sustainable funds amid a pullback from them in the US. This change is more substantial than most. Tokenized securities are moving closer to a reality as issuers make plans to bring more assets and funds on-chain. Even with the lights out at the SEC, it’s unlikely that ETF issuers seeking 3x and 5x funds will sail through the approval process. The new VanEck TruSector ETFs invest in stocks and other ETFs to maximize exposure to individual companies and reflect actual market caps. No one knows the future, but high inflation could make some investments virtually worthless. As regulators have warmed up to crypto and assets have poured into ETFs, advisors who ignore the trend risk losing clients, proponents said. Analysts from JPMorgan on Monday wrote that levered ETFs might worsen macro swings by increasing intraday volatility. The firm has waited until now to expand its US product line as sales trends are favoring ETFs over many mutual funds. As the iShares Bitcoin Trust nears the milestone, dozens of spot-price crypto ETFs are being prepped to come to market. © 2025 The Daily Upside

Title: As Wall Street Centralizes Bitcoin And Crypto, Prague Stays The Course

ByJon Helgi Egilsson, Contributor. Seventeen years after Satoshi Nakamoto released the Bitcoin whitepaper to eliminate financial middlemen, Wall Street has found a way to bring them back — with firms like BlackRock and Fidelity wrapping Bitcoin and Ethereum into ETFs and custodial products that make investors once again dependent on the very middlemen Bitcoin was meant to replace. But in Prague, the birthplace of the first hardware wallet, a team of engineers is doubling down on Satoshi’s vision — preserving financial freedom through simple, practical self-custody. When I sat down with Matěj Žák, Trezor’s CEO, in Prague, he began with a story that explains why financial independence runs so deep here. In May 1953, under communism, Czechoslovakia’s government wiped out 98% of citizens’ savings overnight. The night before, the president went on national radio to insist the currency was strong. Twenty-four hours later, people’s life savings were gone. He noted that this distrust still feels relevant. “In this century alone, more than 700 banks have gone bankrupt. People keep losing their savings — not because they took too much risk, but because someone else did. Freedom is a choice, and it’s yours to decide whether to take it.” That legacy helps explain why so many Bitcoin pioneers emerged from Prague. Founded in 2013, Trezor built the world’s first hardware wallet — a device that lets users hold their own cryptographic keys securely, offline. Eleven years later, it remains privately held and proudly independent in an industry dominated by venture-backed custodians and centralized exchanges. Unveiled in Prague this week, Trezor’s new Safe 7 wallet advances the company’s mission to make self-custody simple. Wireless, open-source, and built for long-term resilience, it features a transparent security chip developed with Czech firm Tropic Square — a counterpoint to the industry’s opaque “black-box” designs. When I asked CEO Matěj Žák why users should trust Trezor, he smiled.“You shouldn’t — that’s the point,” he said. “Everything we build is open source so you — and anyone in the world — can inspect how it works. The same applies to your digital assets. Don’t trust anyone else with them. Rely on self-custody. Keep your private keys to yourself; we don’t want them. We want you to be independent.” CTO Tomáš Sušanka said the team is preparing for threats still over the horizon. “For years I thought quantum computing was science fiction,” he told the audience. “But within the next decade, Bitcoin and other blockchains will move to post-quantum algorithms. Safe 7 is ready for that — it’s about protecting digital freedom for decades to come.” Chief Commercial Officer Danny Sanders put it more simply: “Independence and freedom shouldn’t feel like a penalty. Our goal is to make security effortless — to make self-custody the easy choice for freedom, not the hard one.” Žák knows, though, that the pull of convenience is strong. “At a time when convenience is drawing users toward custodians and ETFs, we believe it’s more important than ever to reinforce what self-custody really means — full control, without compromise,” he told me. “The safest option should also be the most intuitive — transparency, usability, and trust that doesn’t ask for permission.” Seventeen years after Bitcoin’s whitepaper set out to remove financial intermediaries, the ecosystem has split in two. Millions still hold their own keys, but a growing wave of institutional products is bringing custody back under centralized control. Glassnode data cited by Cointelegraph show that over 72% of all Bitcoin — around 14.3 million BTC — is now illiquid, suggesting most long-term holders still keep their coins off exchanges. Yet Fidelity estimates that ETFs, corporations, and custodians could collectively hold more than six million BTC by 2025 — close to a quarter of all Bitcoin that will ever exist. Their combined holdings grew 30% this year alone, signaling accelerating consolidation at the top. The irony is clear: as Bitcoin goes mainstream, it risks mirroring the system it was meant to disrupt. “Bitcoin was never meant to make banks rich again,” said Trezor CEO Matěj Žák. “It was created so people could exchange value directly — without asking permission. Every time someone chooses convenience over control, that original freedom shrinks a little.” Žák knows that most people won’t embrace self-custody for ideology alone — it has to work in everyday life. “Freedom has to be easy,” he told me. “If self-custody feels complicated, people will give up. They’ll trade independence for convenience. So we design for simplicity — because that’s how freedom survives.” That philosophy runs through Trezor’s design choices: high-resolution touchscreens instead of buttons, wireless connectivity instead of cables, and open-source code instead of NDAs. It’s an attempt to make self-custody not just safer, but smoother — a modern form of usability engineering aimed at preserving autonomy. As I left Prague, Žák’s words stayed with me: “Our grandparents had no choice. We do.” Financial freedom isn’t granted by institutions that profit from dependence. It’s a conscious act — and often an effort. But freedom isn’t given — it’s chosen. The choice is ours.

Title: $1.8 trillion Wall Street giant files active multi-coin ETF to challenge BTC dominance

Forget Bitcoin-only exposure: T. Rowe wants a managed crypto basket with room for Solana and XRP. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. T. Rowe Price, one of the biggest old-school fund managers in the US with roots stretching back to 1937, is finally dipping its toes into crypto, but not just with another Bitcoin tracker. A Oct. 22 SEC filing reveals the $1.8 trillion firm wants to run a fund with a “diversified basket of crypto assets,” targeting between 5-15 coins weighted differently than the usual market cap approach. They aim to beat the FTSE Crypto US Listed Index (the top ten exchange-listed tokens) while keeping the freedom to zig when others zag. This puts T. Rowe in a small club of major players designing products around active management instead of simple exposure. It’s a departure from what BlackRock did with its spot Bitcoin ETF (now holding about $90 billion) and Fidelity’s $23 billion fund. Those are just passive Bitcoin conduits; T. Rowe’s approach is more like an equity fund, with managers trying to outperform by making smart allocation choices across multiple assets. The Baltimore firm has watched money flow out of its mutual funds for years, many of which couldn’t keep up with passive benchmarks. Since 2021, they’ve lost over $67 billion in assets under management despite the broader market rally. CEO Rob Sharps has been under pressure to modernize the 87-year-old firm’s approach, especially as younger investors increasingly bypass traditional funds altogether. Crypto gives them a fresh battleground where active management might actually still work. They’ve already built the trading infrastructure, with “end-to-end capabilities” for custody and execution. T. Rowe has historically been more conservative than peers like BlackRock, and they were noticeably absent from the first wave of spot Bitcoin ETFs. This makes their multi-coin approach even more surprising. The FTSE Crypto US Listed Index currently includes Bitcoin and Ethereum alongside alts like Solana and XRP, hinting at what the portfolio might look like. Their square-root weighting means smaller assets get proportionally bigger allocations than in typical market-cap models. For example, if Solana represents 5% of the crypto market cap, it might get closer to 15-20% allocation under this model. This matters because every major ETF so far has just reinforced Bitcoin’s dominance. A multi-asset approach could finally spread liquidity more evenly across the upper tier of crypto. This structure also shows how institutions are gradually accepting altcoins within regulatory boundaries. By sticking to “listed” assets, the index essentially limits the fund to tokens traded on US-compliant exchanges, providing legal cover while expanding options. For investors, that means getting exposure to assets like Solana, Cardano, or XRP without dealing with sketchy offshore products. The implications for crypto markets run deep. Current institutional flows primarily feed Bitcoin’s liquidity, with smaller trickles to Ethereum. If approved, T. Rowe’s fund could create more balanced institutional demand across multiple assets. With T. Rowe managing over $1.8 trillion, even a tiny allocation percentage could represent billions in potential inflows to altcoins. There’s a bigger strategy here: active, multi-asset ETFs might shape the next wave of crypto money flows. BlackRock and Fidelity built empires on Bitcoin’s simplicity; T. Rowe is betting people now want professional judgment over what comes next. The fund would test whether crypto can evolve from a single-asset play into a managed allocation, similar to how big institutions diversify across sectors. With Trump supporting digital assets and the CME preparing 24-hour crypto futures trading next year, traditional finance is making more room for digital assets. T. Rowe’s move fits right into this trend: crypto is shifting from fringe speculation to a legitimate asset class. For retail investors, T. Rowe’s entry offers something different: professional risk management in a notoriously volatile space. Rather than trying to time individual altcoins, they could potentially benefit from T. Rowe’s century of investment experience applied to the crypto market. The fund would essentially function as a “crypto portfolio in a box,” potentially attracting investors who find individual token selection overwhelming. Industry veterans might recognize this as part of a broader pattern. First came Bitcoin-only vehicles, then Ethereum. Multi-asset funds represent the third wave of institutional crypto adoption. The next logical steps would be sector-focused crypto ETFs (like “DeFi-only” or “Web3 Infrastructure”), followed eventually by thematic crypto funds mirroring how traditional ETFs evolved. Whether this kicks off an “altcoin ETF season” depends on how regulators handle multi-asset exposure. But the precedent is there. If T. Rowe gets approval, others will follow with their own mixes of liquidity, custody partners, and index rules. Franklin Templeton and Invesco are reportedly watching closely, with their own multi-asset frameworks nearly ready. What started as a Bitcoin ETF arms race could become a competition over who defines the broader investable universe of crypto, potentially reshaping how capital flows into digital assets for decades to come.

Title: Trillion-Dollar Legacy Asset Manager Enters Crypto Space with ETF Covering XRP, Solana, Cardano, Shiba Inu

A $1.8 trillion mutual fund giant is seeking approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for its first crypto-based exchange-traded fund (ETF), marking a bold move into the digital assets industry. T. Rowe Price surprised onlookers after filing for an S-1 registration statement with the SEC on Wednesday to introduce the T. Rowe Price Active Crypto ETF. The application states that the fund is expected to hold five to 15 crypto assets that are eligible under the SEC’s generic listing standards, which include Bitcoin, Ether, Solana, XRP, Cardano, Avalanche, Litecoin, Polkadot, Dogecoin, Bitcoin Cash, Chainlink, Stellar Lumen, and Shiba Inu. These listing standards, recently approved by the SEC, significantly shorten the timeline for crypto ETFs to start trading. If approved, the fund would give investors active exposure to digital assets, a significant shift that would shake up its largely mutual fund-focused offerings. Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas noted in a post on X that the filing was a “SEMI-SHOCK,” remarking that T. Rowe has focused mainly on mutual funds across its 87-year history. “Did not expect it but I get it,” Balchunas wrote. “There’s gonna be land rush for this space too.” However, T. Rowe Price has been signaling interest in crypto for a while now. During an ETF conference in Las Vegas earlier this year, Dominic Rizzo, who manages the company’s technology-focused ETF, suggested that now is a good time to consider Bitcoin exposure. He compared the crypto’s price to that of a commodity, saying it closely tracks the cost of mining it. Having long focused on mutual funds, T. Rowe Price’s foray into crypto ETFs comes after other legacy asset managers such as BlackRock and Fidelity had rushed to list such vehicles to overwhelming success. “Can’t overstate significance of T. Rowe Price filing for an actively managed crypto ETF out of left field,” President of NovaDius Wealth Management, Nate Geraci, posited. “A firm founded in 1937 is now building out the full infrastructure to handle crypto trading and manage a crypto ETF.” The T. Rowe Price Active Crypto ETF joins a growing list of over 155 crypto-related exchange-traded fund applications currently at the SEC’s desk. Most of these applications, including ones for Ripple’s XRP and Solana, are in limbo amid the US government shutdown, which is now in its 22nd day.
