We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Dividend Knights that Beat The Market Last 3 Years. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Cintas Corporation (NASDAQ:CTAS) stands against the other dividend stocks that beat the market in the last 3 years. The broader market has been performing strongly this year, rising by nearly 30% since the beginning of 2024. According to Morningstar Direct, the S&P 500's return has exceeded this level in only 17 of the past 74 years. For instance, in 1954, the index saw a gain of over 52%, and in 1989, it increased by about 31%. However, analysts caution investors to manage their expectations, as years with such exceptional returns are uncommon. Cathy Curtis, a certified financial planner and the founder and CEO of Curtis Financial Planning made the following comment about the market’s performance this year in one of her recent interviews with CNBC: “Investors should know that the stock market has an average annualized return of over 10% for decades. The past year has seen growth way over this amount and it would be highly unusual for that to continue for a multi-year timeframe.” Regardless of where the market ends up, dividend stocks have strong potential, as demonstrated over the years. During past periods of inflation, dividend stocks performed better compared to other asset classes. Since the 1940s, dividends have accounted for 40% of the market, with this share increasing during times of higher inflation, according to Hartford Funds. The report also highlighted the performance of dividend stocks in the 1970s, when they made up 73% of the market’s returns. Additional studies, including one from Fidelity International, showed that dividends typically grow faster than inflation. Fidelity's research indicated that since 1900, the 10-year annual average growth of dividends in the market has outpaced CPI growth nearly 73% of the time. In addition to their considerable impact on overall market returns, dividend stocks provide investors with a way to mitigate risks linked to market volatility. According to DWS Group, over the past 20 years, the monthly volatility of dividend returns was just 0.10%, compared to 3.75% for price returns. The report also noted that despite market fluctuations, investors have seen positive overall returns during this period. While riskier factors played a significant role in these returns, it was the dividend stream that proved to be a more stable and safer option amid the uncertainties of the stock market.

The Dividend Aristocrats Index has grown by just nearly 11% this year, but the outlook for dividend growth among US companies is promising. According to Howard Silverblatt, Senior Index Analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices, large-cap stocks outperformed many others in the first three quarters of 2024, driven by record earnings and an anticipated record dividend payout for the year. He further added that the market’s large caps are expected to see a 6% increase in dividend payments for 2024, compared with 5.1% in 2023 and 10.8% in 2022. When it comes to dividend investing, investors often prefer companies with a strong track record of dividend growth and solid returns as they help prepare for challenging market conditions. Additionally, investors focus on a company's ability to generate cash flow and maintain a strong balance sheet, as these factors support the sustainability of future dividend payouts. In view of this, we will take a look at some of the best dividend knights that have outperformed the market in the last three years. Our Methodology: For this list, we used a stock screener and selected dividend companies that have outperformed the market in the past three years. These companies also have strong dividend growth track records under their belt. We also considered hedge fund sentiment around each stock using Insider Monkey's data for Q3 2024. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of their three-year returns. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

Overall CTAS ranks 4th on our list of the best dividend knights that beat the market in the last 3 years. While we acknowledge the potential for CTAS as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Title: Why is Solid Power, Inc. (SLDP) Among the Best Lithium and Battery Stocks to Invest In?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 11 Best Lithium and Battery Stocks To Invest In. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Solid Power, Inc. (NASDAQ:SLDP) stands against the other lithium and battery stocks. According to a Reuters report from November 6, automakers are preparing for potential changes under President-elect Donald Trump, including new tariffs on vehicles imported from Mexico and the reversal of pro-electric vehicle policies. Trump has indicated plans to rescind EPA and Transportation Department regulations and may reduce or eliminate EV tax incentives. Moreover, the Zero Emission Transportation Association expressed a willingness to collaborate with Trump on future EV development. Trump has also warned of tariffs of up to 200% on Mexican vehicles and is considering similar measures for imports from other regions while encouraging foreign automakers to build plants in the US. Additionally, in October, Reuters reported that the European Union approved additional tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, ranging from 7.8% to 35.3%, on top of the existing 10% duty, in response to what it calls unfair subsidies by China. These tariffs, effective October 30, aim to address concerns over subsidized raw materials, batteries, and financing, with China opposing the decision and calling for negotiations to prevent further trade tensions. China has launched its own probes into EU imports, including pork, dairy, and brandy, potentially retaliating against the EU measures. Chinese EVs currently account for 8% of the EU market, a figure expected to grow to 15% by 2025, with their prices typically 20% lower than European counterparts. The investigation has caused division within the EU, with Germany opposing tariffs while France supports them. GlobalData lowered its 2030 U.S. EV market share forecast from 33% to 28%, citing weakened emissions standards and a focus on lower oil prices after the 2024 elections. Bloomberg reported on November 7 that Mark Wakefield of AlixPartners highlighted that $129 billion in EV investments through 2027 and the $7,500 EV tax credit may be at risk. Automakers are expected to cut EV spending, delay new models, and shift production toward hybrids and gasoline vehicles, like Volkswagen’s adaptation at its South Carolina plant. While reversing Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act could prove challenging, changes to fuel economy standards are likely, though their impact may not be felt until later in the decade. The lithium market has experienced a huge decline over the past several quarters due to oversupply and lower demand. However, Ana Cabral, Co-Chair & CEO at Sigma Lithium is positive about the future demand for lithium as discussed in a September interview with CNBC. She noted that lithium prices hit a low point in August but have been recovering steadily. The Chinese recovery package, the largest since COVID, has especially boosted the market, as China accounts for more than half of global EV sales. While the U.S. has seen slower EV adoption compared to China and Europe, with growth in China outpacing the U.S. and Europe, the fundamentals remain strong. As China continues to dominate the EV market, it plays a crucial role in driving demand and lithium prices. Regarding other uses of lithium, Cabral emphasized that EV batteries remain the primary driver, especially as automakers shift away from combustion vehicles, which is expected to create further demand in the coming years. Our Methodology For this article, we used stock screeners to identify around 20 lithium and/or battery stocks and chose the 11 stocks most widely held by institutional investors. The stocks are listed in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment, as of Q3 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A battery powered electric vehicle charging in a city storefront. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 12 Solid Power, Inc. (NASDAQ:SLDP) specializes in solid-state battery technology, focusing on applications in electric vehicles and other sectors. The company is known for its sulfide-based solid electrolytes and licenses its innovative cell designs and manufacturing methods. Its technology improves battery safety and boosts energy density by 50-75% compared to traditional batteries. This positions the company as a key player in industries like EVs, electronics, and aerospace. Solid Power continues to work closely with partners like BMW and SK On, focusing on developing competitive solid-state battery technology for automotive applications. Additionally, the company signed a non-binding Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with a major battery manufacturer to explore potential collaboration on electrolyte development. It is also strengthening relationships with research institutes in Korea. Solid Power (NASDAQ:SLDP) management highlighted significant milestones in Q3, including the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) selecting the company to negotiate a $50 million grant for a project aimed at producing sulfide-based solid electrolyte materials for all-solid-state batteries (ASSBs). This selection is seen as a validation of Solid Power’s technology and business model. The company is focused on advancing both the performance and manufacturing of its electrolyte products, moving from batch production to a continuous manufacturing process, with the first pilot line planned for installation within the next 12-18 months. By 2026, Solid Power expects to produce 75 metric tons of electrolytes per year, increasing to 140 metric tons by 2028. On the cell side, the company made improvements to its A-2 cell design, aiming for higher performance in safety and energy density, with testing expected in early 2025. Overall SLDP ranks 9th on our list of the best lithium and battery stocks to invest in. While we acknowledge the potential of SLDP as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than SLDP but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

A laboratory technician pouring a specialty blend of industrial chemicals into a beaker. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 12 Sociedad Química y Minera de Chile S.A. (NYSE:SQM) is a global leader in producing lithium, iodine, and specialty plant nutrients, leveraging its exclusive access to mineral-rich reserves in Chile’s Atacama Desert. This position enables the company to support industries like EVs and renewable energy storage. Operating in over 100 countries, SQM held an 18% share of the global lithium market in 2023, supplying products to 207 customers across 39 nations, with a strong focus on Asia. Its partnership with Kidman Resources in Australia has further expanded its lithium operations. Moreover, a partnership with Chilean state-owned Codelco, lasting until 2060, aims to improve production and adopt advanced extraction technologies. In Q3, SQM reported solid performance across its business lines in Q3 2024. Specialty Plant Nutrition volumes grew by more than 20%, boosting revenues by 12% year-over-year despite lower prices. Iodine prices showed steady growth due to strong demand and limited supply. In lithium, sales volumes exceeded 51,000 metric tons, an 18% increase from the previous year, though prices declined 24% from the previous quarter due to temporary oversupply. Analysts are also quite optimistic about the long-term prospects for SQM. On November 25, The Fly reported that Scotiabank lowered its price target for SQM shares from $60 to $50 but still rated it as Outperform. The bank sees SQM as the best long-term option among the lithium companies it covers. However, the price target was reduced due to expectations that lithium prices will stay low for a longer period. Overall SQM ranks 10th on our list of the best lithium and battery stocks to invest in. While we acknowledge the potential of SQM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than SQM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 15 AI News Updates That Broke The Internet. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Marvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL) stands against the other AI stocks that broke the Internet recently. With Trump taking in the reigns soon, steps toward overhauling the US policy have begun. President-elect Trump said on Thursday that he is appointing former Pay Pal Chief Operating Officer David Sacks as his "White House A.I. & Crypto Czar”. “David will guide policy for the Administration in Artificial Intelligence and Cryptocurrency, two areas critical to the future of American competitiveness. David will focus on making America the clear global leader in both areas,” READ NOW: 15 AI News Investors Shouldn’t Miss and 15 Buzzing AI Stocks Making Headlines Officials such as the crypto czar, a title that is not known to be official, along with other officials in Trump's incoming administration such as the chairs of the Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission, are anticipated to reshape U.S. policy on digital currency along with a newly created crypto advisory council. lad Gil, an entrepreneur, stated that the choice of Sacks is a "strong move" in a post on X. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman also congratulated him. In other news, OpenAI has debuted a “research grade” version of its main artificial intelligence (AI) model. The ChatGPT Pro is a $200-per-month plan that includes unlimited access to the company’s smartest model, OpenAI o1, as well as to o1-mini, GPT-4o and Advanced Voice. “As AI becomes more advanced, it will solve increasingly complex and critical problems. It also takes significantly more compute to power these capabilities”. ChatGPT Pro also includes o1 pro mode, a version of o1 that uses more compute for thinking harder and provides even better answers to the hardest problems. OpenAI also expects to add more powerful, compute-intensive productivity features to this plan in the future. Moreover, the company announced that it is awarding 10 grants of ChatGPT Pro to medical researchers at leading institutions in the U.S. to help drive meaningful progress in fields that benefit humanity. Artificial intelligence is also shaping the healthcare industry. As per a recent study by Accenture, AI-driven healthcare has the potential to save up to $150 billion annually by 2026 in the US. This is done by reducing administrative costs, automating patient education, and improving adherence to care plans. In particular, AI-powered assistants can provide essential, 24/7 support. In the latest news, researchers from Germany and the US have developed a deep learning framework for automated volumetric body composition analysis using whole-body MRI. Published in eBioMedicine, the study validated this approach and demonstrated its potential to predict all-cause mortality in a large Western population. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). An assembly line in a semiconductor factory, with workers at their stations. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 70 Marvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL) engages in the development and production of semiconductors and is focusing heavily on data centers. On December 4, JPMorgan analyst Harlan Sur raised the price target on Marvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL) to $130.00, from $90.00, and maintained an “Overweight” rating. The rating follows Marvell’s impressive October quarter results which exceeded Wall Street’s expectations. The company reported sales of $1.52 billion, surpassing the $1.46 billion consensus forecast for its fiscal third quarter. Chief Executive Matt Murphy revealed that the quarter’s growth was largely driven by sales of new custom AI accelerator chips for Amazon and other builders of the so-called hyperscale data centers running today’s huge AI software models. Harlan Sur’s rating is based on this very impressive performance and promising outlook, driven by strong growth in the company’s data center business, particularly in AI ASICs and AI optical DSPs. Not only has the company achieved better-than-expected results, but has also achieved partnerships with major clients like Amazon and Google which strengthens its market position. Moreover, the company’s positive trajectory in its cyclical businesses, along with its anticipated revenue growth from AI, places it for continued earnings growth heading into 2025.

It also takes significantly more compute to power these capabilities”. ChatGPT Pro also includes o1 pro mode, a version of o1 that uses more compute for thinking harder and provides even better answers to the hardest problems. OpenAI also expects to add more powerful, compute-intensive productivity features to this plan in the future. Moreover, the company announced that it is awarding 10 grants of ChatGPT Pro to medical researchers at leading institutions in the U.S. to help drive meaningful progress in fields that benefit humanity. Artificial intelligence is also shaping the healthcare industry. As per a recent study by Accenture, AI-driven healthcare has the potential to save up to $150 billion annually by 2026 in the US. This is done by reducing administrative costs, automating patient education, and improving adherence to care plans. In particular, AI-powered assistants can provide essential, 24/7 support. In the latest news, researchers from Germany and the US have developed a deep learning framework for automated volumetric body composition analysis using whole-body MRI.

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 64 Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (NYSE:HPE), an American multinational technology company, provides high-performance computing (HPC) systems, AI software, and data storage solutions for helping to run complex AI workloads. On December 6, Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (NYSE:HPE) was revisited by a Wall Street analyst Toni Sacconaghi from Bernstein who maintained a “Hold” rating along with a $21.00 price target. Sacconaghi has given a hold rating due to mixed signals in its financial outlook. Even though Q4 results slightly exceeded expectations, there remains a cautious outlook due to the pending Juniper acquisition and the modest projection for IT spending in 2025, also leading to a lack of full-year guidance. Moreover, AI server revenues did meet expectations, but there were weak net bookings and a declining AI backlog suggesting challenges ahead. Moreover, HPE had “debooked” a significant portion of server orders, implying potential risks in its order book concentration and customer creditworthiness. Lower R&D spending and weak cash flow compared to income are some more factors for the firm’s cautious approach. Overall HPE ranks 7th on our list of the AI stocks that broke the Internet recently. While we acknowledge the potential of HPE as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

We recently compiled a list of the 12 AI News and Ratings Investors Probably Missed. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) stands against the other AI stocks that investors probably missed. AI is increasingly shaping diverse industries, from healthcare and website design to cybersecurity. Companies are utilizing traditional AI and generative models to improve diagnostics, customer experiences, and business efficiency. While AI offers immense benefits, it also presents new challenges, especially in securing sensitive data. As businesses continue to innovate with AI, balancing its advantages and potential risks will be crucial for future growth.

At the CNBC CFO Council Summit on December 4, Squarespace’s Nathan Gooden, Zoetis’s Wetteny Joseph, and Varonis’s Guy Melamed shared their insights on how artificial intelligence is being integrated into their businesses. From animal health and website development to cybersecurity, these executives discussed the ways AI is improving their operations, improving customer experiences, and addressing emerging challenges. They also explored the evolving role of generative AI and its potential impact on the future of their industries. Wetteny Joseph discussed how AI is being used in animal health, noting the integration of traditional AI in diagnostic platforms for animals, such as a system that quickly analyzes slide images to identify health issues, with potential to expand into human healthcare. Nathan Gooden highlighted the long-standing use of machine learning in the platform, and the incorporation of generative AI to simplify the website design process for customers. Guy Melamed mentioned AI’s dual impact: improving customer protection while also presenting risks, such as exposing sensitive data via AI tools like co-pilot. His company focuses on securing data and preventing unauthorized access through these AI systems.

Its products are used in industries like high-performance computing, smartphones, automotive, and consumer electronics. According to a report by Reuters, Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) is in talks with Nvidia to produce its Blackwell AI chips at TSMC's Arizona facility, which is set to begin volume production in 2025. The chips, currently made in Taiwan, are in high demand for generative AI and computing tasks. While the Arizona plant will handle the chips' front-end process, packaging will still take place in Taiwan due to the absence of CoWoS technology in the U.S. facility. Taiwan Semiconductor’s (NYSE:TSM) Arizona plant already serves customers like Apple and AMD. This expansion is part of TSMC's significant investment in Phoenix, supported by U.S. government subsidies to boost domestic chip production. Overall TSM ranks 6th on our list of the AI stocks that investors probably missed. While we acknowledge the potential of TSM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Title: Why Is Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) Among the Best Tech Stocks for Long Term Investment?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Tech Stocks For Long Term Investment. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other tech stocks. In a recent conversation on December 3, Clare Pleydell-Bouverie from Liontrust Asset Management appeared on CNBC and shared insights on the current state of innovation, particularly in Silicon Valley. She emphasized that the pace of innovation is not only continuing but is accelerating. This rapid evolution necessitates frequent visits to the region to discern which companies are successfully navigating this transition and which are not. Pleydell-Bouverie noted that the clarity regarding these companies is improving quarter by quarter. She expressed a firm belief that the beneficiaries of the new technology cycle, which began about 18 months to 2 years ago with the advent of ChatGPT and the AI Revolution, will differ significantly from those in the previous technology cycle. While established names remain relevant, her focus is increasingly on opportunities beyond the MAG7. The discussion also touched on market trends for 2025, highlighting a significant focus on AI infrastructure. Pleydell-Bouverie indicated that this year has seen a concentrated effort on building out the necessary compute infrastructure before monetization can occur. This infrastructure encompasses not only silicon but also semiconductor equipment and networking components, which are essential for scaling AI capabilities. She pointed out that while model providers are often viewed as commoditized, there is an ongoing arms race to develop large foundation models. Engineering tools that facilitate the integration of AI into businesses and various applications are also critical, although currently, most value resides within the AI infrastructure layer. Looking ahead, Pleydell-Bouverie anticipates a shift in focus toward application layers where substantial disruption is expected. Numerous AI startups are targeting established players like Salesforce, indicating a competitive landscape. Despite this shift, she believes that the importance of NVIDIA in AI infrastructure remains strong. She described its role as pivotal, suggesting that it is positioning itself to become the operating system for an emerging landscape of AI-infused software set to launch in the coming year. Pleydell-Bouverie cautioned against viewing the company merely as a chip provider; instead, she argued that understanding its strategic positioning within this technological paradigm shift is crucial for investors. Her insights reflect a broader narrative about Silicon Valley's ongoing transformation and its implications for investors looking to navigate this rapidly evolving technological landscape effectively. As tech stocks become increasingly popular, we're here with a list of the 10 best tech stocks for long-term investment. Methodology We first sifted through the stock screeners and internet lists to compile a list of the top mega-cap tech stocks. We then selected the 10 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q3 2024. The hedge fund data was sourced from Insider Monkey’s database which tracks the moves of over 900 elite money managers. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A development team working together to create the next version of Windows. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 279 Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a technology giant that is well-known for its impactful technologies and has recently made significant strides in the AI landscape. In November, it launched new and improved AI models designed to cater to various industries, enhancing its offerings through the Azure AI model catalog. Recent reports indicate that the company's investments in AI are beginning to yield positive results. In FQ1 2025, which ended on September 30, the company reported $65.6 billion in revenue, reflecting a 16% increase year-over-year. This was driven by a record quarterly revenue of $38.9 billion from its cloud services, a 22% increase year-over-year. The Azure segment alone achieved a remarkable 33% growth in revenue, due to high demand for AI-driven solutions within its cloud offerings. These developments highlight the effectiveness of its strategy in harnessing AI to boost business outcomes. The company revealed plans to build 3 trusted platforms focused on maximizing the benefits of AI for the business, demonstrating its approach to integrating AI into core business functions. Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) is at the forefront of AI innovation, with a clear focus on expanding its capabilities through partnerships and product enhancements. It is positioned to capitalize on the growing demand for AI solutions across various sectors, reinforcing its status as a leader in the technology industry. Baron Opportunity Fund stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the world’s largest software and cloud computing company. Microsoft was traditionally known for its Windows and Office products, but over the last five years it has built a $147 billion run-rate cloud business, including its Azure cloud infrastructure service and its Office 365 and Dynamics 365 cloud-delivered applications. Shares gave back some gains from strong performance over the first half of this year. For the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024, Microsoft reported a strong quarter with total revenue growing 16%, in line with the Street; Microsoft Cloud up 22%; Azure up 30%; 43% operating income margins; and 36% free cash flow margins. Core Azure growth came in one point shy of expectations, however, due to a soft European market and continued constraints on AI compute capacity. In the same vein, while Microsoft reiterated its fiscal 2025 targets of double-digit top-line and operating income growth, quarterly guidance called for Azure growth to slow a bit before accelerating in the back half of the fiscal year, as capital expenditures increase, yielding an expansion of AI compute capacity. We believe this investment is a leading indicator for growth, with more than half of the spend related to durable land and data center build outs, which should monetize over the next 15-plus years. We remain confident that Microsoft is one of the best-positioned companies across the overlapping software, cloud computing, and AI landscapes, and we remain investors.” Overall MSFT ranks 2nd on our list of the best tech stocks for long term investment. As we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MSFT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Storm Darragh welcomes All-Ireland League back after break with Clontarf heading to Ballynahinch

The effects of Storm Darragh welcome back the Energia All-Ireland League (AIL) after a two-week break, with the first of two significant rounds to be played over the next two weekends before the festive break at the halfway point. Ballynahinch, the somewhat surprising leaders after five successive bonus-point wins, host third-placed Clontarf at Ballymacarn Park where they have not been beaten since April. Just over year ago the sides played out a 24-all draw here, with the recently capped Cormac Izuchukwu among the home try-scorers and Hinch look stronger this season, with hooker Clayton Milligan’s six tries even outnumbering his prolific counterpart Dylan Donnellan on four. They are without Ben Moxham as well as fellow winger Aaron Sexton, who is heading to the USA to pursue a career in the AFL, while Jake Humphreys returns at outhalf. Clontarf are also much changed, with Alex Soroka at number eight, winger Aitzol King and fullback Andrew Smith among those returning and it looks like being another close arm wrestle. UCD are stacked for their match against Terenure at the Belfield Bowl, so much so that Leinster’s match-winner in Ulster, James Culhane, is on the bench, while fellow academy players Ben Brownlee, Diarmuid Mangan, Rory McGuire, Ruben Moloney, Conor O’Tighearnaigh and Alan Spicer all come into the starting XV. Jordan Coghlan’s brace was crucial in Terenure’s 19-12 win last time they met but he is ruled out, albeit ex-Ospreys backrower Will Hickey switches to number eight. Harrison Brewer has overcome his ankle injury and with Chris Cosgrave returning from his trial in Bath to start at fullback, Aran Egan reverts to outhalf. A settled St Mary’s have enjoyed renewing old acquaintances back in 1A this season and, sitting second, they host Young Munster for the first time since February 2018 in a renewal of the famous 1993 shoot-out at Lansdowne Road. Ever since that day, there has always been an edge to this rivalry. To add some extra spice, Conor Hayes (47 points this season) and Dan Goggin (who also has three tries), come up against their former club for the first time. Julian Leszczynski, Young Munster’s leading scorer with 58 points, switches to fullback, with Munster’s Tony Butler and Jake O’Riordan combining at halfback and recently contracted Conor Bartley at tight head. Garryowen, bottom of the table, are reinforced by the return of Liam Coombes alongside fellow Munster players Dylan Hicks, Jack Daly, Brian Gleeson, George Hadden and Ronan Foxe, for the visit of Cork Con. The champions recall last season’s leading try-scorer Matthew Bowen, with Sean French moving to 13, and captain David Hyland returns at number eight. Evidently content with Lansdowne’s win over Clontarf last time out, Declan Fassbender has done that rarity in the AIL and named an unchanged side for their tricky trek to City of Armagh who, curiously, have won their last three away but lost their last three at home. Old Belvedere who lead 1B after taking 19 points out of their last 20, meet Shannon at Ollie Campbell Park for the first time since their 46-8 promotion/relegation playoff win last April. The 2A pacesetters Corinthians head to Banbridge without Seán Naughton, in line for his Connacht debut, while close challengers Cashel and Instonians clash at Spafield.

This Sunday evening opener could be as tough, albeit in a very different way, than the January renewal of hostilities with La Rochelle and it lands on Leinster when they have had the most disruptive preparation of any team in the competition. The net effect of Ireland’s additional autumn match against Australia last week is palpable. In addition to having only a week together again, Leinster are without Hugo Keenan for four weeks due to a wrist injury and James Lowe with a calf strain for an indeterminate amount of time, while Cian Healy and Ryan Baird miss out. Jamie Osborne has also joined their casualty list and after starting all four Irish games and playing 256 and 320 minutes respectively, both Andrew Porter and Caelan Doris are restricted to bench duties. By contrast, two other Irish ever-presents, Joe McCarthy and Josh van der Flier, start their fifth game in five weeks, yet despite the former’s workload and the absence of Keenan and Osborne, RG Snyman and prospective Leinster debutant Jordie Barrett are named on the bench. Both can certainly have a serious impact but even so, the selection of these two stellar names on the bench strongly supports the belief that Leinster are not permitted to start either of them in the Champions Cup. Jack Conan again captains a side showing nine changes in personnel from last weekend’s win in Ulster, with Rónan Kelleher, Joe McCarthy, James Ryan, van der Flier, Jamison Gibson-Park, Sam Prendergast, Robbie Henshaw and Garry Ringrose all return, as does Ciarán Frawley at fullback. The squad trained in Energia Park in Donnybrook on Friday in memory of Dave Fagan, who died this week after a short illness after working with the province as a strength and conditioning coach since 1995 with the senior team, academy and sub-academy. “It gives me goosebumps just thinking about him,” admitted Leo Cullen, who first worked under Fagan when he left school. “When players leave school or club, they go into the Ken Wall Centre of Excellence and it’s like the school of hard knocks down there. It was an unbelievably sad day yesterday here. We try to move on. It won’t be easy, but our thoughts at the moment are with his family.” For his part, Pat Lam makes only three changes from last week’s 48-24 win away to Harlequins — virtually the norm for Bristol — in recalling the English pair of Ellis Genge and Harry Randall, and promoting Harry Thacker. Bristol sit second in the Premiership, with five wins and a maximum nine bonus points in seven games. Collectively they have scored the most tries, 36. Individually, left wing Gabriel Ibitoye, with his pace, strength, elusiveness and extravagant offloading, leads the way with six, as does ex-Blackrock pupil and Connacht’s Pro12 winning outhalf AJ MacGinty in the points charts with 75. “Bristol like to keep the ball on the field, they play quick, they play from anywhere, they have an unbelievably strong running game and for us defensively it’s going to be a serious challenge for the 23,” admitted Cullen. “It looks like a very unstructured free-flowing game, but it is very structured in the roles the players would have within that.” Now in his eighth season there, not surprisingly Lam has Bristol singing a tune familiar to Connacht and to his credo that all his players, backs and forwards, must touch the ball over 1,000 times in training every week. Bristol always look to push the pass, keep the ball off the deck and vary the point of attack. They don’t mind conceding 30 so long as they score 40. “They are completely unique,” admits Jacques Nienaber, relishing the challenge. “You won’t find a lot of international teams that will play like that because if you lose [at Test level] it’s written in history. “At club level you can have a little bit of a crack because if you lose a game, you score 30 and they score 31, it’s not as detrimental. It’s not knock-out yet. “But that is why I’m so excited, to try and work out plans for Pat and all the things that he has lined up for us. Listen, they’ve got a bag full of tricks and you can be 21-0 down in 15 minutes if all their stuff sticks and you’re a little bit off your game.” This could be a wild and fluctuating ride, and Leinster will most likely have to roll with a few punches, but they may just have enough forward power and ballast off the bench to come through.

Title: ‘I remember Past Ross thinking, you need to stort being nicer to Future Ross. He’s a genuinely good bloke’

Listen on Sorcha says she knows me. She knows me inside-out. But I tell her that the Rossmeister General still has one or two surprises in his locker. Yeah, no, we’re staying with Sorcha’s old pair in Stoneybosher while the fire damage to our gaff is being fixed and they’ve told us we can decorate their gaff for Christmas. So we’re off to buy a tree and then we’re going to swing into Killiney to collect our baubles and various other bits? Which is actually what we’re orguing about. Sorcha says I’m going to be spending the entire weekend disentangling the lights, but I’m making the point that I didn’t just fock them all into the same box after Christmas last year. Yeah, no, I separated them, then I stretched them out and wrapped each set individually around pieces of, like, cordboard. Sorcha laughs. I’m there, “What’s funny?” She goes, “I remember you saying that you were going to do that? As a matter of fact, you say it every year. But then when it comes to it, you can never be bothered and you end up just throwing them all into the same box for Future Ross to sort out.” “But last Christmas,” I go, “I remember Past Ross thinking, ‘You need to stort being nicer to Future Ross. He’s a genuinely good bloke. Do the dude a solid for once in your life.’ I remember saying that out loud, Sorcha – very clearly.” There’s a “Christmas Trees for Sale” sign on a lamp-post as we’re approaching the junction with Ailesbury Road. Sorcha’s like, “Will we stop here?” But I’m there, “What, Michael’s? I wouldn’t have a Michael’s tree in the house, Sorcha. Even though I’d consider James Ryan a very good friend and obviously Dan Leavy and the Byrne brothers.” She goes, “You see? This is why I’m so dubious about you wrapping the lights. Because you always, always insist on making things hord for yourself.” “That’s not true.” “It’s one hundred per cent true.” “Sorcha, I actually remember very pacifically thinking – and it was the mention of Ross and Harry Byrne there that reminded me – when you’re a ten and you score a try, you have the option of either putting the ball down in the corner, so you can show off your kicking skills with the conversion, or putting it down underneath the posts, just to make it easier on yourself. And I remember thinking, as I was wrapping the lights, ‘You’re basically putting the ball down beneath the posts here, Rossmeister.’” “You’ve suddenly remembered that?” It’s, like, every single year you used to say that you were going to give up drink after Christmas, do twelve hours per week in the gym and make a comeback to rugby “Yeah, no, I’m like Celine Dion here – it’s all coming back to me now. And then I actually texted Ross Byrne – or I might have sent him a voice note – to tell him what I was doing. Because I’m always saying to him that once you’re a kicker, you never, ever stop thinking like a kicker – and that’s for life. And he came back to me with either a thumbs-up or a smiley face emoji.” “Will we stop at Blackrock College for a tree?” “Not a focking chance. Wouldn’t give them the pleasure.” She’s like, “So where did the cordboard come from?” I’m there, “Excuse me?” “The cordboard. That you supposedly wrapped the lights in.” “I think you’ll find the word is supposably?” “It’s not, Ross.” “Isn’t it? Well, whatever. It would have been cordboard that we had just lying around.” “So you don’t remember where it came from?” “I think it might have been a Corn Flakes box, or – yeah, no, I’m remembering now – it was a Rice Krispies box. Because you know the way I always love a bowl of Rice Krispies on Christmas morning.” “Ross, I really think this is all wishful thinking on your port.” “Excuse me?” “You constantly do this. You tell yourself that you’re going to do something, and you manage to persuade yourself that you’ve done it – even though you haven’t?” “Don’t suppose you’ve any examples of this, Sorcha?” “Yeah, I do. It’s, like, every single year you used to say that you were going to give up drink after Christmas, do twelve hours per week in the gym and make a comeback to rugby.” “Jesus.” “What?” “You had that one in the chamber, ready to fire, didn’t you?” “And then in January, February, Morch, I would hear you tell people that you were off the booze and absolutely crushing it in the gym. Even though you weren’t.” “So you’re calling me a liar?” “I never thought you were lying. I always thought you’d convinced yourself that it was actually true. I think your enthusiasm sometimes gets the better of your sense of reality.” “Well, brace yourself, Sorcha, because you’re about to be shocked.” We drive the rest of the way in silence. Eventually, we pull into Honalee. There’s, like, five or six workmen out the front of the gaff, having their tea break. Sorcha goes, “My husband is just going to pop up to the attic to get the Christmas lights if that’s okay?” “Don’t mention Christmas lights,” one of the dudes goes. “I spent the whole of last weekend try to untangle the things.” Sorcha’s there, “Well, Ross is convinced that he wrapped them all individually after last Christmas.” The dude actually laughs. He goes, “I always tell myself I’m going to do that. That’s me. Every year.” I decide to block out the voices of the doubters and the naysayers. I tip upstairs, open the attic, clamber up the ladder, switch on the light and find the box. I stare at the lid of it for a good, like, thirty seconds, listening to my own breathing as I prepare to open it. Then I grab the two flaps, tear it open and look inside. Sixty seconds later, I’m carrying the box down the stairs and out to the cor. All of the workmen are standing around waiting to find out whether I actually did wrap the lights or not. “Well?” one of them even goes. I’m there, “Get on with the work, will you? We want to be back in the house before Christmas 2025.” I throw the box on the back seat and Sorcha storts the cor. She doesn’t say anything for a good, like, five minutes, then she goes, “I’ll tell you what, let’s treat ourselves to new Christmas lights this year.” I’m like, “Yeah, no, good idea,” and then I go, “Past Ross is a total dick, by the way.” Ross O’Carroll-Kelly was captain of the Castlerock College team that won the Leinster Schools Senior Cup in 1999.

Title: Christmas dinner wines to get the table talking

Bored drinking the same wine every Christmas? We tend to revert to the same few staples every year: Chablis, Mâcon, Rioja Reserva, Bordeaux and one or two other tried-and-trusted favourites. However, there are plenty of other options, wines that might provoke a little conversation around the table. Smooth-textured white wines go nicely with turkey as well as seafood starters. Instead of a chardonnay, this week I suggest a delicious Spanish white made from the godello grape. I tried the Château Thieuley with some smoked salmon I had in the fridge and the two went very well. It might be a bit light for turkey or red meats, though. But you could also try a viognier or an albariño from Spain. I tend to go for lighter red wines with my turkey, usually a Burgundy, a syrah from the Northern Rhône, or a gamay, but I think the Dāo would also do very nicely. If you prefer fuller-bodied wines I would suggest a southern Rhône, Languedoc or Australian grenache-based red that will be low in tannins and therefore great with turkey. If you are catering for a large gang of people, the featured Lidl Grenache would be ideal. I would also recommend the excellent Château Cazal-Viel Saint Chinian from Dunnes Stores, a steal at €10 and perfect with turkey. Rich soft strawberry fruits with a long rounded finish. Perfect with turkey and all the trimmings. From Lidl Rich textured fruit, a touch of toasted hazelnuts and a lively refreshing acidity. This would be good with shellfish or roast root vegetables. From Winesdirect.ie A gorgeous wine with floral aromas elegant ripe red fruits, and soft tannins on the finish. Enjoy with turkey, goose or mushroom dishes.

Title: ‘Dave played such a big role’ – Leo Cullen pays tribute to late Leinster S&C stalwart Dave Fagan

Jordie Barrett and head coach Leo Cullen during a Leinster training session at UCD this week. Photo by David Fitzgerald/Sportsfile Sam Prendergast Dave Fagan had a profound influence on the Leinster match-day 23 that arrived in Bristol this morning, and Leo Cullen admitted the death of the club stalwart after an illness had hit the organisation for six. The strength and conditioning coach’s name regularly cropped up in discussions with young Leinster players whose journey as professionals began working with him at the club’s centre of excellence in Donnybrook, where he’d help turn the boys into men. He was as much part of the Leinster furniture as head coach Cullen who yesterday recalled working with the former shot put coach when he was transitioning from Blackrock College into senior rugby in the late 1990s. “It gives me goosebumps just thinking about him,” Cullen said yesterday. “We just trained in Energia Park in memory of Dave. When players leave school or club, they go into the Ken Wall Centre of Excellence and it’s like the school of hard knocks down there. “Dave is there since I came out of school. I was explaining to Rabah Slimani on the pitch today about how in the olden days when Mike Ruddock was the head coach and I went in as a 19-year-old, it was a prefab building where the Old Wesley gym is now . . . that’s where we all would have done our training. “Everyone was learning about professionalism and Dave has been involved in Leinster since those days. He was around my whole career and it seems like a long time ago since I played rugby. “He was a great character to have around, a great sounding board for me about young players coming through. He had so much knowledge, he’d seen so much and he could spot them a mile away – the good and bad ones – and it’s such a great skill. “You go into the gym down there and there’s this picture on the wall, Dave takes great pride in the players that step into the senior team. That’s where they all came through, in terms of our home-based players, he was such a big role in that. “It was an unbelievably sad day yesterday here, we try to move on. It won’t be easy, but our thoughts at the moment are with his family.” There are no plans to formally mark Fagan’s passing at Ashton Gate tomorrow, but you sense the squad will feel the need to deliver a performance for the coach. The big news at yesterday’s team announcement was Cullen’s decision to select Sam Prendergast at out-half. There had been plenty of speculation about whether the Kildare youngster would be put in cold storage after starting back-to-back Tests for Ireland, but the head coach conceded his performances in November had moved the dial on selection. “It’s never straightforward. Sam is a young player, he’s very talented. Not just him, you have to make sure the transition is smooth,” he said. “You have to be open-minded . . . listen, we’ve four 10s that can do a really good job for us. They’re all internationals now. Sam wasn’t an international four weeks ago, now he is. “That’s a different conversation in terms of his level of experience and exposure he’s been through, which is fantastic because . . . we could talk about him, but Gus [McCarthy] and Thomas Clarkson as well, we’ve three young players and now they are internationals and that’s great for them to go through because they grow in terms of their confidence. “Hopefully, that’s a positive thing for us as a group. I thought Ross [Byrne] did a great job for the team on Friday night [against Ulster], but we’ve got to be respectful that we’ve a guy who started the last two Tests for Ireland. “We have, when we’re talking about selection, it’s this week. It’s not a call that was made six weeks ago. We can have conversations, but it’s ifs, buts and maybes until we’re sitting down together as a group of coaches saying this is how it’s played out. The three lads coming back, it’s fantastic to have and obviously Sam is one of them.” McCarthy and Clarkson are on a stacked bench that includes Andrew Porter, RG Snyman and Jordie Barrett, who will make his club debut against an in-form Bristol side. Cullen confirmed Hugo Keenan (wrist) and James Lowe (calf) are facing spells on the sidelines, while he said Tadhg Furlong was also a number of weeks away from returning. Pat Lam and his Bristol Bears represent a formidable opening test but Leinster have a cause and they should be too strong. Verdict: Leinster Bristol Bears: R Lane; J Bates, BJ van Rensburg, K Ravouvu, G Ibitoye; AJ MacGinty, H Randall; E Genge, H Thacker, M Lahiff; J Dun, J Owen; S Grondona, F Harding (capt), B Mata.

Title: SEC, fund managers should quit pushing NetZero — it hurts shareholders
URL: https://nypost.com/2024/12/06/opinion/sec-asset-funds-should-quit-pushing-netzero-it-hurts-shareholders/
Time Published: 2024-12-06T23:05:06Z
Full Content:
As a new administration soon takes charge, what will become of climate policy? That’s a question worth asking, since it was nearly invisible this past election. A recent Gallup poll on the importance of various issues showed that “the economy” was first out of 22 issues; “climate change” was 21st. Incoming President Donald Trump has declared the United States will not be a party to the Paris Climate Agreement or the United Nations’ NetZero 2050 plan, which requires countries to achieve net C02 emissions by 2050. Yet some large fund managers, including BlackRock, State Street and Wellington, have other ideas. They are members of consortiums whose members pledge to push the firms they invest in to abide by NetZero 2050. But fund managers are fiduciaries who are supposed to work in the best interest of their investors. This means aiming for the best possible financial return. Pushing firms to comply with the Paris Agreement’s costly mandate is inconsistent with this. Consider an investor who voted for Trump. She has invested her retirement savings with a fund manager who is a consortium member. Like most people, she is unaware that the consortiums exist. Unbeknownst to her, the fund manager is using her investments to pursue a policy she probably doesn’t support and will likely leave her worse off. How is the fund manager fulfilling its fiduciary obligation? The consortiums are powerful. Investors increasingly own shares indirectly through investment funds, which means the fund managers do the corporate voting. The consortiums collectively control enough shares to influence corporate policies and determine who sits on corporate boards. Climate Action 100+ has over 700 investors with $68 trillion in assets. The NetZero Assets Managers Initiative includes 325 fund managers with over $57 trillion in assets. BlackRock, State Street and JP Morgan recently made news when they left Climate Action 100+, after it began requiring some consortium members to engage with policymakers and publish details about NetZero 2050 discussions with the companies they invest in. Yet all three remain in the NetZero Assets Managers Initiative, which does not have these requirements. Some asset-manager-consortium members have encouraged the Securities and Exchange Commission to take measures to further their climate-change agenda. In March 2024, the SEC adopted its controversial climate-change rule, which requires firms to discuss climate change in their annual reports and registration statements. Before that rule, a firm had to report any risk material to its business. If a firm saw climate change as a major cost or benefit, it was supposed to say so. But if a firm does not see climate change as a major issue, why should it be required to discuss it in its annual report? The new rule says it must. The SEC is not an environmental regulator. It is supposed to ensure that firms provide accurate disclosures so investors can make informed decisions. It is not supposed to tell thousands of firms what types of risk each faces, climate or otherwise. As for climate risks, firms typically don’t provide financial forecasts 75 years into the future. A report by President Biden’s Council of Economic Advisers examined 12 peer-reviewed studies on the costs of climate change. The consensus estimate was less than 2% of GDP with warming 4.5 degrees Fahrenheit relative to preindustrial levels, about what the United Nations predicts by 2100 under plausible emissions scenarios. If that is right, the economic effect of climate change will not be that large in our lifetimes and won’t even be noticeable for a long time. Meanwhile, the cost of climate-mitigation policies could be significant. Great Britain made NetZero 2050 its official policy. It now has the highest electricity costs in the developed world, five times higher than in the United States. Higher energy costs lead to higher prices and slower economic growth. American voters seem uninterested in this expensive tradeoff. Hopefully, fund managers will return to strict adherence to fiduciary duty. Such an approach would reinforce the specialization of labor, which Adam Smith explained so well. Accountants do your taxes. Dentists clean your teeth. The SEC regulates issues concerned with finance and accounting. And fund managers should try to get you the best possible financial return. R.

The crypto industry is excited about a second Trump presidency. by Ellen Ioanes and Nicole Narea The price of bitcoin surged past $100,000 for the first time on Thursday, continuing a post-election run buoyed by the pro-crypto promise of the incoming Trump administration. On Election Day, bitcoin — one of the most popular decentralized digital assets available — was worth $69,374, according to the cryptocurrency trading platform Coinbase. Within a month, it had spiked more than 44 percent. Other cryptocurrencies like ethereum and XRP also shot up during that period. Cryptocurrencies’ sudden increase in value is a sign of investor optimism about President-elect Donald Trump’s policies and those of his picks to head several key regulatory agencies, some of whom have explicitly promised deregulation of the crypto industry. “That bitcoin hit the $100,000 mark reflects the expectation of both political support and regulatory latitude under the incoming administration,” said Ramaa Vasudevan, an economics professor at Colorado State University who has been critical of crypto. “The nomination of crypto-enthusiasts for administrative posts is a clear signal of the embrace of bitcoin and crypto triggering the flood of money into these markets.” Bitcoin’s rally is also a product of its increased legitimacy. Trump’s election may have sparked its rally, but the financial establishment’s embrace of the asset in recent months provided the tinder. While bitcoin was once a niche curiosity, it is now a mainstream digital currency that everyday Americans can now buy through reputable retail investment accounts. Even if bitcoin ultimately turns out to be a bubble, as many economists have argued it may, these investment vehicles have assured it some staying power. Trump has been an ardent cryptocurrency supporter throughout his most recent presidential campaign, and his choices to lead key government agencies related to its regulation reflect that enthusiasm. Bitcoin hit its highest valuation ever following the nomination of Paul Atkins on Wednesday to head the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which is in charge of regulating tradable securities like stocks. Atkins was previously an SEC commissioner for six years during former President George W. Bush’s administration. Atkins is “not necessarily the sort of burn-it-all-down type of nominee that Trump has decided upon for other positions,” Molly White, a cryptocurrency researcher and critic, told Vox. “He’s fairly establishment; he has the SEC background, but he also was a very strong advocate for deregulation when he was in the SEC and certainly since then.” Atkins is also a co-chair of the Chamber of Digital Commerce’s Token Alliance, an industry lobbying group that advocates for lax regulation of cryptocurrencies. Perianne Boring, the CEO of the Chamber of Digital Commerce, is rumored to be one of Trump’s top picks for another key position: head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which makes rules around the trading of futures and commodities. Currently, cryptocurrency is under the purview of the SEC, but the Trump administration is reportedly weighing regulating it as a commodity instead. If that change is made, cryptocurrency would come under the purview of the CFTC, which is often seen to be more hands-off in its approach to regulation. Billionaire crypto enthusiast David Sacks, whom Trump named Thursday as his crypto and AI czar, will be tasked with helping formulate crypto and AI policy from the White House. In that role, Trump said in a post on Truth Social, Sacks will work closely with both the SEC and CTFC to develop a legal framework to regulate crypto. Trump himself is also connected to cryptocurrency via his family’s cryptocurrency and trading venture World Liberty Financial. Pro-cryptocurrency groups spent $245 million in this year’s elections, more than any other industry, to support candidates across the country seen as friendlier to crypto. All of that likely means that the regulatory landscape under a Trump administration will be much friendlier for crypto following heavier regulations and a slew of lawsuits against crypto companies during current SEC chair Gary Gensler’s tenure. “The recent wave of investment in the crypto space is largely driven by the growing belief that years of regulatory uncertainty and lawfare may finally be giving way to clarity,” said Christian Catalini, founder of the MIT Cryptoeconomics Lab. Gensler’s SEC cracked down on trading platforms like Coinbase, Binance, and Kraken, arguing that the buying and selling of cryptocurrency should have the same oversight as something like a stock or bond, and that investors should have access to the same kinds of information about crypto companies as they would have about a company that they are buying stock in. Crypto trading platforms and associated companies, however, argue that crypto tokens aren’t the same as stocks and therefore shouldn’t have the same regulations applied. The SEC has brought lawsuits against several major crypto platforms, including Coinbase, which are ongoing. But they could be dropped under the Trump administration, and regulation around bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is likely to change significantly under Trump. Under a Trump regulatory regime, cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance and Coinbase could operate with less threat of litigation, making it easier for people to trade on their platforms. Enthusiasts say this will spur innovation in the industry, but it could also mean that individual traders using such platforms are more exposed to fraud, theft, and the volatile nature of the currency. Over the past five years, and particularly following the downfall of crypto trading platform FTX in 2022, the narrative around cryptocurrency’s utility has changed. Now, it’s being touted more as an investment instrument rather than a form of currency that can be used like cash, White said. And that pivot is also helping its valuation. In January, the SEC gave the green light to the first bitcoin exchange-traded funds (or ETFs) in the US. ETFs are baskets of financial instruments (such as stocks, bonds, commodities, or in this case, cryptocurrencies like bitcoin or ethereum) that are bought and sold on a regulated stock exchange. ETFs offer anyone indirect access to cryptocurrency, if they choose to invest. Put simply, if the value of bitcoin increases, so does the value of these ETFs — but because of the bundled nature of ETFs and their presence on a regulated exchange, investors are more insulated from loss if bitcoin’s value declines. Firms including BlackRock, Invesco, Fidelity, Grayscale, and Ark Invest have rolled out bitcoin funds, which offer new investors, especially those who might be more risk-averse, easy ways to purchase or gain exposure to cryptocurrency. Previously, investors had limited options for trading bitcoin. They could go on a cryptocurrency exchange to directly buy bitcoin, but then would have to figure out how to safely and conveniently store it long-term. (Cryptocurrency held on an exchange can be vulnerable to theft, while crypto stored offline is safer but difficult to trade.) They could also invest in risky bitcoin futures, agreeing to buy or sell the currency at a later date at a certain price. Now, ETFs offer an establishment-backed option. “While no one can predict the exact inflection point or when the price will stabilize, the long-term driver of bitcoin’s rise is its evolution — not just as digital gold, but as a foundational layer of global financial infrastructure,” Catalini said. However, Vasudevan said that there is still reason to believe that crypto’s climb won’t last forever. Bitcoin has surged before, only to crash precipitously. In November 2022, bitcoin’s value dropped 20 percent, to below $16,000, in a matter of days after the spectacular downfall of the crypto exchange FTX. The concern remains that the price of crypto is based purely on speculation, rather than any inherent value. “This has all the makings of another bubble, one that is being stoked by the prospect of a more favorable regulatory environment and the possibilities it is opening for new products and funds that can draw in more and more people into these markets,” Vasudevan said.

We recently compiled a list of the 15 Best Advertising Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc. (NYSE:IPG) stands against the other advertising stocks. Ad spending in 2024 received a significant boost from recurring events such as the US election and the Olympics, and experts believe that these spending patterns are likely to add billions to the market. Media agency Magna increased its US ad spending forecast for the year, expecting revenue growth of 11.4% to $377 billion, per the news shared with Marketing Dive. The company expects non-cyclical ad spending to grow by 8.9%, reflecting a rise from 8.2% in previous forecasts. This marks one of the best performances for the category in 20 years. This revision stemmed from improved macroeconomic conditions, healthy appetites in digital and streaming, and cyclical events, such as the elections and the Summer Olympics. As per PwC, fueling revenue growth by selling E&M products directly to users is challenging. Of the 3 major categories i.e., consumer spending, connectivity, and advertising, consumer spending is the smallest and slowest growing. The connectivity category i.e., fixed and mobile services, topped US$1.1 trillion in 2023. Advertising outpaced consumer spending in 2023 and should top US$1 trillion in 2026. PwC believes that it is expected to grow at a 6.7% CAGR through 2028. With advertising expected to make up ~55% of total E&M industry growth over the upcoming 5 years, PwC believes that it will become a more important part of companies’ business models. For strategic reasons, all participants in the E&M industry are required to be more skillful at selling ads. According to PwC, the changes to the way businesses approach the ad business are expected to be seen in 3 key areas. Firstly, the monetization of data is expected to fuel more sophisticated advertising models. Next, the connection will be closer between the discovery of products and services and their purchase and consumption. Finally, it will be important for companies to understand how global privacy regulations impact growth. READ ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In.

(NYSE:IPG)’s stock has been on analysts’ radar as they believe that the impact of significant account losses might weigh on the company’s future performance.

Furthermore, losses of creative revenues from Pfizer and GM are likely to impact the company’s 2025 performance. However, industry experts opine that The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc. (NYSE:IPG) is now well-placed to turn tides and might now witness a revival. This is because of its focus on several strategic initiatives targeting to improve its competitive position and fuel future growth. The company continues to emphasize key areas like Retail Media, Data, Generative AI (GenAI), mergers and acquisitions (M&A), and production improvements. The retail media sector continues to rapidly expand, with retailers developing their own advertising platforms, providing The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc.

Title: Why Occidental Petroleum Corporation (OXY) is the Best Fuel Stock to Buy Now?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 8 Best Fuel Stocks To Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) stands against other best fuel stocks to buy now. Fuel stocks, often referred to as energy stocks, represent shares of companies involved in the exploration and development of oil and gas reserves, as well as those specializing in drilling for these resources. Additionally, companies that refine crude oil into usable products, such as gasoline and diesel, also fall under this category. In an interview with Bloomberg on December 5, Amrita Sen, Founder and Director of Research at Energy Aspects, discussed the current state of the oil market and the upcoming OPEC+ meeting. Sen noted that OPEC+ members are unlikely to increase production, given the traditional maintenance season in Q1 and Q2, which typically leads to crude stock builds. Instead, she expects the group to delay the planned output to effectively get rid of the seasonal builds and reassess the market in the second half of the year. Sen highlighted that the current state of global inventories is incredibly low and that in the US, inventories are expected to end the year below 420 million barrels, which is at their lowest since 2007. Despite this, oil prices have been stuck at a low price, as analysts and industries are expecting a bearish 2025 and are discounting their current inventories When asked about the risk of a serious breakdown in OPEC+ members, Sen said that it is unlikely to happen as the members are committed to maintain a stable price, rather than engaging in a price war. She recalled the price war in April 2020, which led to a decline in prices, and said that OPEC ministers want to avoid a repeat of that scenario. While they do want prices to be higher, they also realize that if there is a breakdown and the market is not managed properly, prices can also go lower.

Sen agreed that the recent commencement of Canadian oil shipments to international markets via the Trans Mountain pipeline represents a significant development in the industry and has enabled Canadian producers to benefit from increased access to global markets. Sen notes that China has a strong preference for Canadian heavy oil, primarily due to its consistent quality, which is well-suited to the requirements of modern Chinese refineries. Sen also said that all the new refineries coming online in China, India, and other South Asian countries are primarily designed to process medium or heavy sour crude oil, and its demand is projected to reach a net 800,000 barrels per day. Sen pointed out that the refining capacity in regions such as Europe, North America, and other OECD countries is expected to decline, with a projected loss of 1 million barrels per day during the next year, comprising 400,000 barrels in Europe and an additional 400,000 in the United States, due to environmental concerns. Looking ahead to 2025, Sen expects the average oil price to average around $80 for Brent, but there are risks skewed to the upside due to the possible tightening of sanctions on Iran, Venezuela, and Russia under the Trump administration. Energy plays a crucial role in the global economy, as it provides the essential resources needed to power industries, transportation, and homes. The oil and gas industry continues to play a pivotal role in meeting the world’s energy needs, even as the push for cleaner alternatives gains momentum. With that in context, let’s take a look at the 8 best fuel stocks to buy now. To compile our list of the 8 best fuel stocks to buy now, we used Finviz and Yahoo stock screeners to find the 25 largest companies in the oil and gas sectors. We then used Insider Monkey’s Hedge Fund database to rank 8 stocks according to the largest number of hedge fund holders, as of Q3 2024. The list is sorted in ascending order of hedge fund sentiment. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Oil derricks in the background with a few workers in the foreground, emphasizing the company’s oil and gas production activities. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 71 Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) is a global energy company engaged in crude oil exploration, production, and marketing. The company maintains a significant presence in the U.S., the Middle East, and Latin America, serving as a key supplier of crude oil to refineries and industrial sectors. Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) is focusing on utilizing its existing infrastructure in the Delaware basin acreage to develop secondary benches inside the existing wells by leveraging technology. By doing so, the company aims to replace reserves at a low cost. Additionally, the company is reducing costs through infill development and has been able to add considerable reserves through extensions and discoveries. As a result, Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) is replacing reserves while investing less than its current depreciation and depletion costs. Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) plans to maintain a five-rig program within its CrownRock assets through 2025, targeting mid-single-digit production growth. The company is also focused on retaining flexibility in capital expenditures across its broader U.S. onshore portfolio to respond to shifts in commodity prices. With the integration of CrownRock assets and strong performance from new wells in the Permian Basin, Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) anticipates achieving a production level of 1.45 million barrels of oil equivalent per day in Q4.

The Lawrence Energy Center in Kansas burns coal for electric power. A federal lawsuit filed by 11 Republican attorneys general claims institutional investors BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street committed antitrust violations to lower supply and increase the cost of coal. (Photo by Jill Hummels/Kansas Reflector) Major institutional investors have artificially lowered coal production and raised energy costs for consumers in an effort to lower global carbon emissions, a federal lawsuit claims. Republican attorneys general in 11 states filed a joint lawsuit last month against BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street, claiming the organizations’ efforts to pressure coal companies to lower carbon emissions and respond to climate change amount to anti-competitive business practices. All three companies, the lawsuit says, have acquired significant shares in the largest publicly-traded coal companies to coerce their management. “For the past four years, America’s coal producers have been responding not to the price signals of the free market, but to the commands of Larry Fink, BlackRock’s chairman and CEO, and his fellow asset managers,” the lawsuit says. BlackRock is the world’s largest financial asset manager. The case was in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas on behalf of the states of Texas, Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, West Virginia and Wyoming. The case asks the court to find that the companies have violated federal antitrust laws and prohibit them from using their stock holdings in coal companies to limit output. In a statement, State Street called the lawsuit “baseless.” “State Street acts in the long-term financial interests of investors with a focus on enhancing shareholder value,” the company said. “As long-term capital providers, we have a mutual interest in the long-term success of our portfolio companies.” In 2020, Fink wrote in a letter to CEOs that “climate risk is investment risk” and announced efforts to “place sustainability at the center of our investment approach.” He said companies and investors had a meaningful role to play in the transition from fossil fuels and coal to clean energy. The following year, BlackRock, State Street and Vanguard joined the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, acknowledging an “urgent need to accelerate the transition towards global net zero emissions” and committing to work to reduce carbon emissions. Black Rock and State Street also signed onto Climate Action 100+, a similar initiative where investors work with companies “on improving climate change governance, cutting emissions and strengthening climate-related financial disclosures. Burning coal produces carbon dioxide, the most prevalent greenhouse gas and a significant drive of climate change, scientists say. It also produces sulfur dioxide, particulates and other emissions that can be harmful to human health. Coal made up 19% of energy-related carbon emissions in 2022 and more than half of emissions from electric power companies, according to the Energy Information Administration. In a press release, Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers’ office accused the three companies of weaponizing their shares of the coal market. “Whether it comes from state or federal governments or the private sector,” Hilgers said, “the radical climate agenda harms Nebraskans.” Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey vowed to “not stand idly by while these companies hamper energy production and raise prices for Missouri consumers.” Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita’s office said in a press release that he was “taking further action to stop work corporatists and their left-leaning allies in government from driving up energy costs for hardworking Hoosiers.” “Coal has been the backbone of Indiana’s economic success for decades,” Rokita said. “The demand for electricity has gone up and these (environmental, social and governance) titans are reaping the benefits of these skyrocketed prices by keeping their thumb on production.” And Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird said she would keep “fighting until we take down every cog of the woke machine and protect hardworking families and farmers.” “While Woke Wall Street lines its own pockets,” Bird said, “families and farmers are forced to pay the price.” GET THE MORNING HEADLINES.

Title: U.S. Bitcoin ETFs Surpass Satoshi Nakamoto’s Stack, Now Holding ‘Mind-Blowing’ 1.1 Million BTC

After months of accumulating billions of dollars worth of Bitcoin, the successful BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs) launched earlier this year collectively hold more of the alpha crypto than its mysterious, pseudonymous founder, Satoshi Nakamoto. A chart posted on X (aka Twitter) on Dec. 6 by Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas shows that the 11 spot Bitcoin funds now trading on U.S. stock exchanges hold as much as 1,103,965 BTC as of Dec. 5. Bitcoin’s enigmatic creator (or creators) mined the first Bitcoin back in 2009 under the moniker Satoshi Nakamoto, and their true identity has remained a mystery. Satoshi is believed to have mined roughly 22,000 of the first blocks, which, when multiplied by the 50 BTC block reward at the time, gives 1.1 million BTC. “The US spot ETFs have just passed Satoshi in total Bitcoin held, now hold more than 1.1 million, more than anyone in the world, and they’re not even a year old yet, literally babies still. Mind-blowing,” Balchunas quipped. KING OF THE HILL: The US spot ETFs have just passed Satoshi in total bitcoin held, now hold more than 1.1m, more than anyone in the world, and they're not even a year old yet, literally babies still. Mind blowing. h/t @EdmondsonShaun for the data pic.twitter.com/FQBIGGz5ei The 11 ETFs’ unprecedented accumulation signals significant investor interest in Bitcoin exposure via highly regulated investment products, despite these red-hot vehicles only going live in the US market in January. The most prominent BTC ETF is BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), the largest Bitcoin ETF by assets under management. The IBIT recently topped 500,000 BTC (or over $50 billion) in AUM just as the price of the maiden cryptocurrency hit the $100,000 milestone for the first time on Wednesday. Notably, BlackRock boss Larry Fink conceded earlier this year that he was wrong about crypto and has changed his stance over the last five years. Spot Bitcoin ETFs like IBIT have played a huge role in bringing traditional institutional and retail investors into the crypto market. The data cited by Balchunas indicates that the cumulative ETF holdings now exceed those of crypto giant Binance by 41%. In addition, the ETFs hold roughly 62% more BTC than is held by software firm MicroStrategy — the world’s largest Bitcoin corporate holder. All in all, it is unlikely that Satoshi will ever move their 1.1 million BTC. As ZyCrypto previously reported, Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz recently contended that the enigmatic Bitcoin originator is no longer alive.

Title: From Berkshire Hathaway to Blackstone, here's what Wall Street spends to keep CEOs safe

Wall Street firms spend a pretty penny on executive salaries and compensation, especially for those at the helm. In addition to pay packages often totaling tens of millions of dollars, most CEOs in the financial sector receive other benefits. Given the high-profile nature of their jobs, security details and systems, as well as private cars and planes, are often costs that major firms are willing to incur to keep executives safe. Here’s what some Wall Street giants are shelling out for their CEOs’ safety. Read more: Here’s how much Big Tech spends guarding its wealthiest CEOs JPMorgan Chase (JPM) paid around half a million dollars — $523,271 — on CEO Jamie Dimon’s security in 2023, including $362,226 for personal use of the company plane, $30,400 to use corporate cars, and $150,645 for the cost of residential, personal travel, and related security, according to the company’s 2024 proxy statement. The veteran CEO received $36 million in total compensation last year. Security expenses for BlackRock (BLK) CEO Larry Fink reached $780,350 last year. That included $216,837 for security personnel and $563,513 to upgrade his home security system, the company disclosed in regulatory filings. BlackRock said the added security measures were recommended by an independent, third-party study and supported by the board of directors. This was increased from 2022 amid growing backlash about the company’s diversity equity and inclusion (DEI) practices. Fink received $26.9 million in total compensation in 2023. Goldman Sachs (GS) paid $77,231 for personal car use and $29,990 for “personal security” for its CEO, David Solomon, totaling $107,221 in 2023. Solomon is expected to use the investment bank’s corporate aircraft, including for personal travel, for security reasons, Goldman said in its most recent proxy statement. He received $31 million in total compensation last year. In 2023, Blackstone (BX) spent $4,579,444 related to security services for CEO Stephen Schwarzman and members of his family, the company disclosed in its annual report. The firm said the sum was for its own benefit, and did not personally benefit Schwarzman. The CEO received $119.8 million in total compensation last year. A 2022 security assessment conducted by an independent security consultant found that Wells Fargo (WFC) CEO Charles Scharf “should avoid traveling by commercial ground transport or aircraft” for security purposes, the company said in its 2024 proxy statement. As a result, Wells paid $100,212 for Scharf’s personal use of the company aircraft and $3,454 for commuting using the company car in 2023. Additionally, the bank spent $81,264 on assessing and implementing residential physical and cyber security improvements and ongoing maintenance, of which $66,465 covered installation expenses, Wells disclosed. That added up to $251,395. Scharf received a $29 million pay package last year. Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) provides personal and home security services for its CEO Warren Buffett. Last year, the cost for these services was $313,595. “Berkshire’s Board of Directors believe that in light of Mr. Buffett’s critical role as Berkshire’s CEO and given that Mr. Buffett spends a significant amount of his time while at home on Berkshire business matters that such costs represent bona fide business expenses,” the company said in its 2024 proxy statement. Unlike most other CEOs, Buffett does not rely on Berkshire-owned jets for personal use. Instead, he is a fractional NetJets owner, paying standard rates to access private jets for personal travel. He uses Berkshire aircraft for business purposes only, the Omaha-based conglomerate said. The 94-year-old received $413,595 in total compensation last year, which includes his longstanding annual salary of $100,000. For the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Best AI Stocks to Buy According to Reddit. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP) stands against other best AI stocks to buy according to Reddit. On December 4, Jay Jacobs, US Head of Thematics and Active Equity ETFs at BlackRock appeared on CNBC and discussed the significant growth potential for ETFs as we approach 2025, particularly in the context of the accelerating AI infrastructure phase. He noted that while AI adoption is still in its early stages, substantial investments, amounting to around $250 billion annually from major tech companies, are being made to enhance data centers and develop advanced chips. This investment is crucial for making AI more integrated into everyday life and business applications. Jacobs emphasized that the opportunity in AI extends beyond just mega-cap tech stocks; it encompasses a broader value chain that includes semiconductor and software companies. He mentioned specific ETFs like ARTY (an index-based artificial intelligence fund) and BAI (an actively managed fund) that aim to capture this growth. Additionally, he highlighted the increasing importance of cybersecurity as data becomes more valuable, suggesting that companies will invest more in protecting their data assets. This trend is reflected in ETFs such as IHAK, which focuses on cybersecurity firms benefiting from this heightened demand. Dave Nadig, an ETF expert and Financial Futurist, added insights on how AI will shape ETF investing by pointing to the infrastructure needs that arise from increased energy consumption driven by AI technologies and electric vehicles. He noted that companies involved in power generation and utilities are becoming increasingly relevant as they adapt to rising electricity demands. Both experts agreed on the critical role of physical infrastructure in supporting technological advancements, emphasizing that real-world resources like energy and materials are essential for the ongoing development of AI technologies. Dan Ives, Global Head of Technology Research at Wedbush Securities, also believes the tech market is set for significant growth driven by advancements in AI. He expects AI software companies to play a key role in this expansion, as he mentioned in a CNBC interview on November 25. We discussed this in our article about the 12 Best Artificial Intelligence Stocks To Invest In Under $10, here’s an excerpt from it: “…Ives believes that the consumption model in enterprise AI, driven by advancements from major chipmakers, will lead to underestimated growth rates of 15% to 20% for these software companies. We first sifted through Reddit threads to compile a list of the top AI stocks. We then selected the 10 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q3 2024. The hedge fund data was sourced from Insider Monkey’s database which tracks the moves of over 900 elite money managers. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A young adult family using a Camera to record moments of their daily life. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 34 Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP) is a technology company known for popular products like Snapchat, Spectacles, and Bitmoji. Snapchat, in particular, uses AI to enhance user experiences. The company is also investing in GenAI to empower developers to create more sophisticated AR experiences. For instance, the introduction of AI-powered tools in Lens Studio enables developers to easily generate full 3D characters and animations. Additionally, its AI-powered chatbot, My AI, provides personalized responses and assistance to users, leading to increased user engagement, which is evident by the tripling of Snaps sent to My AI in Q3. The company had strong Q3 2024 financial results, with revenue improving by 15.28% year-over-year to $1.37 billion. This growth was primarily driven by a 16% increase in direct response advertising revenue, which also uses AI for ad targeting and optimization. Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP) is enhancing user experience, and unlocking new opportunities for advertising and revenue generation through AI. RiverPark Large Growth Fund stated the following regarding Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter: “Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP): SNAP was our top detractor in the quarter despite reporting fourth quarter results generally in line with or better than expectations. Revenue growth of 5% was roughly in line with investor estimates and at the high end of guidance, and EBITDA of $159 million was $49 million better than estimates. Daily Active Users (DAUs) were also ahead of investor expectations, ending the quarter at 414 million (about 2 million better), driven by continued innovation in Snap’s offerings. Revenue guidance for 1Q24 was also roughly in line with investor estimates, but EBITDA guidance of negative $55-95 million was well below estimates. The company pointed to increased infrastructure costs and a US focused marketing campaign for the lower-than-expected margin guidance. Overall, SNAP ranks 3rd on our list of best AI stocks to buy according to Reddit. As we acknowledge the growth potential of SNAP, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than SNAP but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: 2024 saw crypto markets dramatically mature

Time Published: 2024-12-06T18:54:30Z

2024 was a landmark year for the cryptocurrency market. It was a year when the market matured, barriers to the institutional investing world came down, and international regulations started to pave the way for digital currencies to enter the mainstream global financial system. With a President-elect keen on making the US a global crypto hub, the market experienced significant growth. As crypto adoption rose, more users turned to crypto platforms and ETFs to invest. 2024 was a transformative experience for the crypto market and the blockchain technology that powers it. The general public, buoyed by positive sentiment and rising crypto prices, has flocked to DeFi platforms to download their first wallet. Many of those new users have found their way to the highly trusted crypto brand Binance. It takes a leader to help an industry continue to mature and Binance CEO Richard Teng has taken on that role throughout 2024’s massive growth. Teng commented on his leadership and the future, “we have served in the best interests of our users since day one, leading the industry’s standard and continue building the future of the industry responsibly.” Binance accounts for approximately 50% of all trading volume globally. This number has only increased from Jan-Nov 2024. During the 2024 US Presidential election week, Binance captured $7.7 billion out of the $20 billion total inflows across all exchanges. Combine that with the leading crypto exchange reaching a new milestone surpassing 200 million users and safeguarding over $130 billion in user assets. So, these are exciting times for the crypto industry that come off the back of a lot of hard work in 2024. The highlights of the year included: In 2024, BlackRock launched its spot Bitcoin ETF IBIT, before bringing options to the table on November 19th 2024, and broke all the records on day one with 354,000 contracts traded and $1.9 billion in notional value. This was a landmark moment for the crypto industry, but it came at the end of a year of institutional investment. Pension funds, hedge funds, and sovereign wealth funds have worked hard into crypto this year as they try to take advantage of the growth potential and protect against problems with fiat currency. They follow on the heels of Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and Fidelity Investments, who all offer Bitcoin as part of their Wealth Management services. Institutional investment has curbed market volatility, and this year, Bitcoin emerged as one possible protection against inflation. New clarity with the regulations, improved custody solutions, and advanced risk management frameworks all gave the institutions the confidence to jump into crypto feet first in 2024. Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is changing the world we live in and providing a real alternative to traditional banking. The world’s unbanked poor and privacy-obsessed High Net Worth Individuals alike have discovered the delights of downloading a crypto wallet and sending money with low fees and no questions. According to one recent study, the global DeFi market should be worth almost $440 Billion in 2030, up from just over $20 billion in 2023. We can now tokenize any asset, from real estate and fine art to cars and stocks, to create more liquidity without the help of a traditional bank. This is opening up new methods of borrowing, saving, lending, and earning interest that put the power in the hands of the people. Unbanked individuals around the world can have access to basic financial services, including sending and receiving money from friends or families, without huge fees. We are also seeing an ecosystem of liquidity pools and borrowing facilities open up that can change the world of finance. In the background, the Web3 technology that underpins the crypto market has found a home with DeFi platforms, as well as retail and e-commerce. Blockchain technology is now the foundation of supply chain management, healthcare providers, and numerous company processes. If the blockchain continues to take over corporate and public life, then the tokenized crypto ecosystem has to go with it. Retailers are increasingly relying on the blockchain, with Starbucks using it to trace their coffee from the farm to the cup and Nike tokenizing each pair of sneakers on its Swoosh platform for authenticity and traceability. In October 2023, Ferrari started accepting crypto payments for its high-end sportscars, joining the likes of Tesla, PayPal, Shopify, and Microsoft. This is a slow process, but crypto has slowly acquired the social proof it requires to break through with mainstream retailers. The blockchain that forms its foundations and is becoming such a mainstream hit was an unexpected bonus. Fragmented regulations that change from country to country are terrible for the crypto industry, and 2024 was the year it finally got its house in order. The Financial Stability Board, International Monetary Fund, and World Economic Forum helped guide disparate countries towards one set of standard practices for crypto taxation, Anti Money Laundering compliance, and consumer protection. A simple foundation of regulations that works across borders could work wonders for the industry. We’re not there yet, but we are getting closer. It isn’t just the political landscape that had to change to give the crypto market a shot at mass adoption. Real technical issues with the early blockchain systems kept them as a niche interest rather than an everyday occurrence. Blockchain congestion, slow transactions, high energy consumption, and scalability were all real issues. Ethereum 2.0 and Layer 2 solutions mean that Ethereum, the most ubiquitous blockchain by far when it comes to dApps and Web3 technology, is now much more scalable, with lower fees and less blockchain congestion. Solana and alternative blockchains like BNB Smart Chain also offer alternative solutions, with blockchain bridges seamlessly connecting the networks. AI integration has already changed the world of trading, analytics, risk management, and supply chain management. Artificial Intelligence has unlocked another level of performance from Web3 technology and automated complex processes that can streamline almost any company. These factors have all combined to create a market that is ready, willing, and waiting for mass adoption. Institutional adoption, regulatory clarity, cultural acceptance, and technical improvements have all helped the cryptocurrency industry go from a sideshow to a central player in 2024. We have not seen anything yet, and next year could be the biggest yet.

As spot Bitcoin ETFs surpassed Satoshi Nakamoto’s holdings Thursday, they were proven right. As of Thursday’s market close, spot Bitcoin ETFs collectively held 1,105,690 Bitcoin worth $110 billion, according to CoinGlass data. Issued by 10 asset managers in the U.S., the clutch of products began trading January 11, all except for Grayscale’s Bitcoin Mini Trust. As Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator (or creators), Nakamoto’s name looms largest in crypto circles. With an estimated 1.1 million Bitcoin held in wallets widely believed to be tied to the Bitcoin inventor(s), the milestone represented an eye-popping stat for ETF watchers, as much as it signaled the market’s maturation past crypto’s long-absent godfather. KING OF THE HILL: The US spot ETFs have just passed Satoshi in total bitcoin held, now hold more than 1.1m, more than anyone in the world, and they're not even a year old yet, literally babies still. Mind blowing. h/t @EdmondsonShaun for the data pic.twitter.com/FQBIGGz5ei — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) December 6, 2024 Bloomberg ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas described the development as “mind-blowing” on X (formerly known as Twitter), noting the products are “literal babies.” Indeed, the products’ holdings stampeded past that of Bitcoin’s creator, or creators, in less than a year. In a recent interview with Decrypt, Balchunas had estimated that the Wall Street products could overtake Nakamoto’s estimated holdings by Christmas. However, spot Bitcoin ETFs have pulled in $2.4 billion since Monday in concert with Bitcoin’s historic climb past $100,000 on Wednesday—perhaps an early gift to the BTC faithful. “It’d be a fitting cap on a storybook launch,” Balchunas told Decrypt Wednesday. “There has never been a launch like this [among ETFs], and there will never be another one.” Thursday’s development came more than 15 years following Bitcoin’s creation. And regardless of whether Nakamoto’s pseudonym corresponds to an individual or group, it has been established that Bitcoin’s namesake mined as many as 1.1 million Bitcoin in the project's first seven months. Nakamoto, who vanished from the public eye in 2011, billed Bitcoin as electronic cash that could flow without the need for financial intermediaries. In that sense, it is somewhat ironic that Wall Street’s most prestigious brands were central to Thursday’s milestone, and that they’ve apparently had such an impact on Bitcoin’s rising value all year long. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has dominated the nascent market for products making Bitcoin investments as frictionless as getting exposure to the S&P 500. On its own, the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) holds 521,000 Bitcoin worth $50 billion, according to CoinGlass. With Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator overtaken as of Thursday, spot Bitcoin ETFs are writing a new chapter in the asset’s history. From esoteric to enmeshed in mainstream finance, Bitcoin’s embrace on Wall Street is meanwhile just beginning.

Title: Mayor Eric Johnson Plays the Hits

Time Published: 2024-12-06T16:54:13Z

The annual State of the City addresses rarely make news. They’re mandated by the city charter, an opportunity for mayors to tout their achievements and highlight progress in the city. Mayor Eric Johnson’s address on Thursday didn’t go off script. He cruised through his favorite municipal talking points: parks growth, a four-year decline in violent crime, the property tax reduction in the unanimously approved budget, and all the infrastructure funding from this year’s bond package. The core of his speech was nearly identical to what he said one year ago; although this one was delivered from the horseshoe at City Hall, not broadcast over conservative radio station WBAP. The only news he delivered was his announcement of a “first-ever comprehensive public safety policy,” overseen by Councilmember Cara Mendelsohn and whoever winds up becoming the next police chief. Mendelsohn is the chair of the Public Safety Committee, but Johnson didn’t elaborate further other than saying it will “guide our next decade of decision-making with regard to public safety.” “I’m thrilled to share with all of you that the state of our city is stronger than ever,” he said. But that doesn’t mean Dallas doesn’t have some tricky matters to attend to. The few interesting parts of his speech dealt with the uncertainties Dallas presently faces, even if he didn’t present them as such. Two of the most important jobs in the city are vacant: city manager and police chief (interim leaders currently fill the spots). And then there’s the outcome of the recent election, in which voters approved changes to the city’s governing document. Now the city must waive its governmental immunity should residents file a lawsuit alleging its employees or elected officials aren’t following the charter or other laws. The other major change to the governing document requires Dallas to hire 900 police officers and retain a total of 4,000, which past mayors and police chiefs have said is an impossible task. The last four budgets have allocated enough money to hire another 250 officers per year, but the total remains stagnant because of attrition. “Dallas voters sent a resounding message to City Hall. Our residents told us loud and clear that they want more police officers on their streets and a city government that is more responsive, more accountable, and more transparent,” Mayor Johnson said. Moments later, he declared: “City Hall must listen.” He didn’t mention that Moody’s Investor Service had revised its outlook on the city’s debt service from “stable” to “negative” following the election (because hiring that many cops will wreak havoc on the budget). And while he praised the $520 million in bond dollars for streets, missing was the reality that borrowing huge amounts of money through bonds is really the only way we can afford to maintain our aging infrastructure. City staff has said we have $17 billion in “unmet needs” that will only get worse as our asphalt and concrete continue to degrade. That should dictate how we build and which developments we prioritize. Infrastructure liabilities are hardly unique to Dallas, but, as Johnson said, “well-kept streets are essential to a flourishing city.” Perhaps hope comes from the tax boost created by the financial service organizations moving to Dallas, such as Goldman Sachs and the BlackRock- and Citadel-backed Texas Stock Exchange. The real question is closer to the ground: reforming the parking code to be more friendly to small businesses, encouraging more types of housing near transit and in empty, old shopping centers, continuing to fix the yearslong permitting backlog (which did get a shout-out from Johnson and has improved). Much of the speech highlighted the city’s park building, from the high-dollar investments like the Halperin (deck) Park over Interstate 35 in Oak Cliff and the Harold Simmons Park abutting the Trinity River levees to the smaller-scale investments by the nonprofit Trust for Public Land. Now three-quarters of Dallas residents live within a 10-minute walk from a park. That’s up from 60 percent in 2017, when former Mayor Mike Rawlings signed a pledge promising to deliver greenspace a short walk from every person living in the city of Dallas. TPL is making good on its promise. And, yes, violent crime has dropped for the fourth year in a row, which lines up with former Police Chief Eddie García’s targeted violent crime plan and the surrounding public investments championed by Johnson aimed at eliminating blight. Dallas is at a critical juncture. The City Council needs to get the top cop and city manager hires right. (Interim City Manager Kim Tolbert is a finalist for the permanent job.) Council this year passed a land use plan that establishes a vision for the city that includes adding housing to push costs down; remember, the city’s population has essentially remained stagnant since at least 2018. The City Plan Commission is weighing reforming our parking code, which sounds dull but could be a catalyst for more small businesses to open all across the city. Parks and public safety are important components for livability, but so are housing prices, a healthy tax base, and the quiet, thankless, complicated policy matters that shape the Dallas we’ll have in the future. That work is still ongoing, beneath the surface of Johnson’s big-picture boosterism.

Hit your long-term targets. Earn up to 16% per year on digital assets. Share this article Ethereum, the second-largest crypto by market capitalization, has surged past the $4,000 mark, a level it last reached in March 2024, driven by strong demand for Ethereum ETFs. This rally represents a 65% increase in Ethereum’s price over the past month, following Donald Trump’s win as the 47th President of the US, and marks a sharp recovery after months of underperformance compared to Bitcoin. Institutional interest in Ethereum has been a key driver of this surge. Ethereum ETFs saw a record daily inflow of $428 million on Thursday. In the past seven days, Ethereum ETFs have accumulated over $1 billion in inflows, with $788 million coming from BlackRock alone, according to Farside Investors data. This wave of investment has propelled Ethereum’s market value to over $485 billion. The price movement triggered significant market activity, with $8 million in liquidations in a single hour and $11 million over four hours, CoinGlass data shows. This price action reflects the market’s optimism following Trump’s appointments this week of Paul Atkins as the new SEC Chair and David Sacks as the crypto czar, both known as pro-crypto advocates.

Ethereum ETF inflows reached a new high while ETH struggled near $4k. Ethereum [ETH] ETFs have showcased commendable performance over the past few days. In fact, its netflows have once again reached a new high, reflecting high adoption and investors’ trust. Despite this, ETH has been struggling to cross the $4k barrier. Lookonchain’s recent tweet pointed out that in the past month, nine Ethereum ETFs have accelerated their holdings of ETH, totaling 362,474 ETH, which were worth over $1.42 billion. This marked a 4,363% increase compared to the previous month, during which only 8,121 ETH, worth over $31.8 million, were added. The better news was that the ETH ETFs inflows reached a high. As per Coinglass data, ETH ETF netflows have been on the rise for the past few weeks. On the 5th of December, netflows hit a whopping $428.5 million, setting a new record. Source: Coinglass Mentioning the market share, Grayscale ETF had the largest market share of 47%, as per Dune Analytics’ data. Grayscale was followed by Grayscale Mini and BlackRock, which had 13% and 12%, respectively. While Grayscale’s holdings touched $5.8 billion, BlackRock’s holdings stood at $2.9 billion. While Ethereum ETFs set a new record, ETH was getting rejected on multiple occasions near the $4k resistance. At press time, the king of altcoins was trading at $3,912.25 with a modest 1.3% price rise in the past 24 hours. Though the token was struggling to breach a barrier, the Ethereum Rainbow Chart suggested investors remain patient. As per the chart, ETH price was in the HOLD zone, meaning that the chances of the token marching upward in the coming days are high. Source: Coincodex In fact, a few other data sets also hinted at a similar possibility. According to Glassnode’s data, Ethereum’s NVT ratio registered a sharp decline. Whenever the metric drops, it means that an asset is undervalued, indicating that the chances of a price increase are high. The technical indicator Relative Strength Index (RSI) moved northward. This meant that buying activity was rising. A hike in buying pressure often results in price upticks. Read Ethereum’s [ETH] Price Prediction 2024–2025 Notably, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) also followed a similar increasing trend. If ETH once again approaches the $4k resistance and is backed by strong buying pressure, then it won’t be ambitious to expect the token flipping the $4k resistance into its new support in the coming days.

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. Insiders say the solar industry was already doing it tough and will face a backlash from the SolarZero collapse. But they add that, ironically, some of the factors that led to the collapse of the BlackRock-owned firm actually bode well for the sector. SolarZero’s November 27 liquidation continued a knock-back year for rooftop solar. In July, Vector said it would terminate its long-running “SunGenie” virtual power plant pilot, involving 243 Auckland households, after its Californian technology partner Sunverge went into liquidation. The lines company offered to take the solar panels, batteries and inverters, with participants also given options to buy the gear. SolarZero had about 15,500 customers - representing about 40% of NZ’s rooftop solar market - liquidators Russell Moore and Stephen Keen (both of Grant Thornton) said in their first report. Another sizable player, Lightforce Solar - which has carried out about 7000 commercial and residential rooftop solar installs, according to its owner and executive director John Harman - has also reduced its workforce. “We’ve got 90 staff. We had 120, we’ve removed 25% of our workforce over the last couple of years,” Harman told the Herald. Despite the belt-tightening, Harman said his firm was well-positioned to keep growing. Mike Casey, chief executive of pro-solar group Rewiring Aotearoa, said: “The best analogy I can make is that Kodak going bankrupt didn’t define the camera. SolarZero had a business model that had reached the end of its life”. He said the economics had become compelling as the price of the technology fell. A family home could now get a 5000 kilowatt system for about $5000. Casey said his Cromwell cherry orchard - which features all-electric machinery and vehicles - was generating rooftop solar at 12 cents per kilowatt hour next to 34 to 36c from the grid. His orchard would have its first full crop of about 90 tonnes this year, Casey said. He anticipated it would be profitable. “SolarZero was a finance company,” Harman said. “We’re vertically integrated.” Lightforce solar buys its panels and batteries from China. Customers own them after the install. “The price of solar panels has come down 25% per year for each of the past three years,” Harman said. The price of batteries had held up, but customers now got a lot more bang for their buck. The price crash - which the Financial Times recently pinned partly on tech gains, and a lot on Chinese over-production - had made it more attractive to buy your own kit rather than take on a 25-year SolarZero subscription, he said. SolarZero wasn’t tenable but rooftop solar is very tenable, said Harman, a breast and general surgeon who went into property development before founding Lightforce. Earlier this year, Lightforce Solar installed 957 panels on the roof of produce logistics firm Poulter Group’s Wiri ripening facility. “That’s a couple of huge cool stores that had a million-dollar a year power bill, and we’re taking $250,000 off that. They’ll have a four-year payback and then they’ll have free power for the next 20 years,” Harman told the Herald. Director Steve Poulter said his firm was still in the process of establishing how much it would save, but it would probably end up being 25%. The switch to solar had also been a pull for new customers. Regardless of his bullishness about commercial rooftop solar, Harman described the industry overall as “barely profitable” and soon after SolarZero’s collapse he took to LinkedIn to post: “The regulatory environment does not favour competition, does not support disruption of the energy market, does not support a favourable outside investor in the renewable sector NZ. “Politicians favour drilling or importing coal and gas. Individuals who invest in the green economy are at a disadvantage. “We urgently need... change.” What reform does he want? Harman later told the Herald he wasn’t interested in Australian-style subsidies (across the Tasman, the focus has recently switched from solar panels - which are now pervasive - to interest-free loans for batteries to store their output to be used during downtimes). Harman said in New Zealand it took about two months for a lines company to sign off on an install and facilitate a meter upgrade. “In Australia, it takes two days”. He wants red tape cut. SolarZero’s collapse could make the industry an easy target for some politicians - and on the subsidy side, Finance Minister Nicola Willis is at loggerheads with NZGIF - New Zealand Green Investment Finance - or at least still pressing the ‘green bank’ set up by the previous Government for better answers (more on which below). But Energy Minister Simeon Brown responded with specifics when the Herald put Harman’s call for regulatory change and red-tape cutting to him. Brown was not immediately able to provide a timeline for any of the below measures, which form something of a wish-list for home solar installers. “Reducing regulatory barriers and cutting through red tape to deliver affordable and secure electricity is a key part of our plan to rebuild the economy and double New Zealand’s supply of renewable electricity,” Brown said. The Government is delivering a number of changes to support greater uptake of solar, Brown said, including: Additionally, the energy competition task force led by the Electricity Authority and Commerce Commission is also investigating a further two actions to support the uptake of household solar panels and batteries, Brown said. The latter two moves could address a sore point for the solar industry: Buy-back rates, or what power companies will pay for rooftop solar owner’s surplus power. Buyback rates vary widely, depending on demand and other factors, but Casey said: “The wholesale market over the last five years has been close to 15 cents a kilowatt hour, and you still have a number of retailers gentailers paying south of 10 cents a kilowatt hour”. The Electricity Authority-funded Powerswitch tracks solar buybacks here. Overall, buyback rates are well below the level they were at before the wave of partial privatisations under John Key’s Government. “Solar energy will play a key role in New Zealand’s future energy system and support the transition to a low emissions economy, and these changes together will help make it cheaper and easier to install solar including rooftop solar installations,” Brown said. SolarZero’s model saw a household pay no money up front for a solar system, instead paying a monthly subscription - $177 per month was quoted for 12 to 14 panels for a household of four over a 25-year term that included one free battery upgrade. If a household’s solar was not enough, it could buy electricity from the grid via SolarZero’s partner, Genesis-owned Ecotricity. Veteran startup advisor and CFO Centre principal Ralph Shale speculates that if a SolarZero system with $20,000 was installed, the lenders would fund 70% or $14,000 with SolarZero funding the remaining $6000. SolarZero then sold the solar gear, and the monthly contracts - for a still-to-be-established sum - as securitised debt to one of two special-purpose vehicles, SPV1 or SPV2. SPV1 and SPV2 received the cashflow from the customer contracts. SPV2 split its revenues, with monthly customer fees going to the Customer Series and ancillary revenues to the Battery Series, the liquidators said. NZGIF was the primary beneficiary of the Battery Series. “NZGIF Solar Investments has oversight over the SPVs, as programme manager,” the liquidators’ report said. NZGIF Solar Investments was the vehicle for NZGIF’s $145m credit line ($115m of which was drawn down at the time of the liquidation), plus $90m (in 2023) and $130m (in 2024) from offshore investors. The liquidators are still establishing the full details and shape of the structure. Notably, Moore and Keen said they and their solicitors “intend to further investigate the companies entry into the securitisation”. But they have already established that it was busting at the seams. “The liquidators understand that SolarZero had underwritten certain aspects of the securitisation, resulting in unsustainable regular payments to the SPVs,” Moore and Keen wrote. After buying SolarZero for $110m in mid-2022 - from owners who included its founder (and a former Greenpeace director) Andrew Booth, Pencarrow and Sir Stephen Tindall’s K1W1), BlackRock tipped in additional capital of $147.5m, the liquidators say. (BlackRock has not released any figures.) “Of the $150m invested by Blackrock, maybe $53m is a cash investment in the special purpose vehicles,” says Shale told the Herald. “The rest must have covered two years of operating costs.” The BlackRock top-ups were required because SolarZero was losing money (the amount has yet to be specified). The liquidation came after the US owner turned off the tap. Shale adds, “If you look at the assets of SolarZero, the major ones are its $29.5m equity in the SPV and $59m in subordinate debt - they say this is non-cash”. He notes the unsecured claims include $24m in intercompany payables, which he guesses is to the SPV. A Thursday morning fact-finding meeting between NZGIF chairwoman Cecilia Tarrant and Finance Minister Nicola Willis and Climate Change Minister Simon Watts only threw up more questions. Shortly after the meeting, Willis said she still needed to know more about: “The failure of SolarZero raised questions about taxpayers’ money being used in this way and those are questions ministers will be giving consideration to,” Willis said. Willis had sought assurances about NZGIF’s other investments. These include solar farm start-up Lodestone Energy, to which it provided a $15m working capital facility in FY24. “This facility remains current,” a spokesman told the Herald. A full list of its investments has been posted online here. While its various SolarZero debt facilities have been easily the largest bits of business for the self-styled “green bank” (it is not a registered bank), NZGIF has also extended chunky credit lines to EV fleet leasing firm Carbn ($42.4m), United Kingdom firm Zenobe ($20m), which is doing work on electrification of businesses in NZ, solar farm firms Far North Solar Farm ($78m) and Lodestone Energy ($15m). And although a lot of NZGIF’s dealings have been with startups, it has also done business with established players including a $1.2m debit facility for Genesis Energy (“to help industry switch from fossil fuels”), a $10m mezzanine debt facility to NZ Post to co-finance $10m spent on electric vans and a $15m “green credit facility” to CentrePort for “accelerating projects to decarbonise Wellington’s port”. As she emerged from her meeting with Willis and Watts, Tarrant initially refused to comment, then said to Newstalk ZB’s Jason Walls: “We do feel very bad, as we all do, about the people who have lost their jobs, but we did not lend to SolarZero the company and we are not responsible for what the company has done”. Tarrant said: “Let’s step back a minute and understand that we did not lend to SolarZero itself. We lent on the receivables; the panels and batteries that were installed on people’s houses and those contracts. “Those customers are fine. They are now being serviced by Verofi as the standby servicer who has stepped in to take over from SolarZero.” The NZGIF debt was securitised and held by two special-purpose vehicles, both of which were taken over by the Public Trust shortly before the liquidation. The special purpose vehicles are not in liquidation. The first liquidators report says: “The Liquidators understand that SZL [SolarZero Limited] had underwritten certain aspects of the securitisation, resulting in unsustainable regular payments to the SPVs”. Later on Thursday, Tarrant added in a statement: “Our Shareholding Ministers rightly have questions about how this all happened, and so do we. The change in stance from SolarZero’s owner BlackRock came as a surprise to NZGIF and other lenders, and indeed appears to have caught SolarZero’s CEO off guard given recent public comments. “We are extremely frustrated by this outcome. NZGIF and other international lenders worked to support the growth of this business. BlackRock has not explained its sudden change in stance toward this company, which has severely impacted its staff, suppliers, contractors and partners. “Prior to early November we had no indication from the SolarZero board or BlackRock that the company did not have the support of its owner, which had been funding the ongoing operation of the group. “NZGIF takes an active role in monitoring and engaging with investee and client companies and it is fair to say we, along with staff, suppliers and customers, have been shocked by BlackRock’s decision to place the company in liquidation,” Tarrant said. An NZGIF spokesman said earlier that it had less than a day’s notice of BlackRock’s intent to liquidate. BlackRock had no comment on Tarrant’s remarks. The liquidators say they’ve “received expressions of interest from parties seeking to buy all or part of the SolarZero business. We are keeping an interested parties register and we are working to develop options for a possible sale with all other stakeholders”. Shale said the true level of interest could only be gauged once the liquidators opened the books for due diligence, with all of the costs that came with that. He said it was also possible that some of SolarZero’s intellectual property - such as the “virtual power plant” platform it developed to pour electricity back into the grid from multiple solar rooftops during the March 10 cold snap - could draw buyer interest.

Title: As BlackRock storms into the private credit arena, longtime players aren't worried about the space getting too crowded

Tens of billions poured into private credit funds in the third quarter — and then the world's largest asset manager joined the party. BlackRock's $12 billion announced acquisition of the private-credit pioneer HPS Investment Partners adds an 800-pound gorilla to a sector already full of similarly aggressive primates. The $11.5 trillion asset manager has not been shy about its ambitions in the private markets, and there are worries about too many dollars chasing too few deals. Other finance giants are trying to get in on the private-credit action, State Street is shopping around for a private-credit firm, and Citi has linked up with Apollo for a $25 billion credit fund. The Singapore sovereign wealth fund Temasek is forming a $7.5 billion private-credit platform. Many smaller asset managers and hedge funds have also launched funds in recent years. Despite everyone looking to get a part of Wall Street's hottest market, longtime private-credit players are not feeling crowded. Managers are focusing on how private credit is servicing certain parts of the market that are set to grow, such as mergers and acquisitions, or differentiating themselves from peers. "The market is proving that private credit has a reason to exist," Nicola Falcinelli, the deputy head of European private credit at Carlyle, said Thursday at Edelman Smithfield's annual investor summit in London. With M&A activity expected to tick up thanks to the reelection of Donald Trump, private-credit providers will be in demand to finance deals, executives said. "Private credit has done a really nice job of filling cracks in" the deal-financing market, Matthew Theodorakis, a cohead of European direct lending for Ares Management, said at the Edelman event. Falcinelli pointed to the "long-term trend of banks retrenching from financing M&A" as validation for the expansion of his sector. "There's healthy competition between capital markets and private credit" across different markets, he said. From some points of view, this competition has given a lifeline to companies that may not deserve it. April LaRusse of London's Insight Investment, which manages $665 billion across different vehicles, said the number of companies defaulting on their debt held steady in recent years despite interest rates rising. Typically, an interest-rate increase would squeeze troubled companies to the point that they're unable to pay their creditors. Instead, LaRusse said, there's plenty of capital willing to extend a lifeline. "High-yield companies have had money thrown at them by private-debt and -equity companies," she said. With the expansion of players in the lending space, there's more of a focus on putting money to work in the right opportunities, not just owning a broad swath of the market, said Putri Pascualy, a client-portfolio manager for private credit within Man Group's Varagon, a $11.8 billion private-credit firm the asset manager purchased last year. Managers will "differentiate through alpha, through credit selection," she said at an event at Man Group's London headquarters. For her, she said, "cash is king" when it comes to judging the quality of borrowers — she wants to see a decent amount of liquidity on companies' balance sheets. Additionally, despite the industry still being a very human-run space of finance, Pascualy said Man was setting itself apart with its artificial-intelligence tools. Blackstone similarly has used its AI tools to pitch insurers looking for private-credit options. Man uses these tools to scan credit documents and weed out human error, Pascualy said, adding that the firm was just at the beginning of seeing which parts of the process it could make more efficient. No matter what, though, she said, the firm and others will expand in the space. "The private-credit universe globally will continue to grow," she said. Jump to

Title: Goldman Sachs Quits Global Climate Coalition for Banks

Goldman Sachs said it has quit a sector coalition aimed at aligning bank lending and investment activities with global efforts to fight climate change, marking the latest high-profile departure of a U.S. financial firm from the group. The U.S. investment bank’s decision comes against a backdrop of pressure from some Republican politicians who have suggested that membership of the Net-Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA) could breach anti-trust rules. Goldman Sachs gave no explicit reason for its departure, but focused on its strategy for the future and a growing push by regulators to make sustainability efforts mandatory. “We have the capabilities to achieve our goals and to support the sustainability objectives of our clients. Goldman Sachs is also very focused on the increasingly elevated sustainability standards and reporting requirements imposed by regulators around the world,” it said in a statement on Friday. Banks joining the voluntary NZBA agree to align with the world’s aim of reaching net-zero emissions by 2050, set targets to help get them there and publish progress on their efforts each year, something Goldman Sachs said it would continue to do. “We have made significant progress in recent years on the firm’s net zero goals and we look forward to making further progress, including by expanding to additional sectors in the coming months,” it said. “Our priorities remain to help our clients achieve their sustainability goals and to measure and report on our progress.” Earlier this year, a number of U.S. investors, including the fund management arm of Goldman Sachs, left a global coalition pushing companies to rein in climate-damaging emissions. Investors including BlackRock are currently being sued by Texas and 10 other Republican-led states over alleged violations of anti-trust law.

Title: Bitcoin hits record high—how much a $1,000 investment would be worth

Related Stories Bitcoin hit a big milestone: On Wednesday night, the digital currency's price crossed the six-figure threshold for the first time. As of Friday morning, that number hovered around $99,000 according to CoinMetrics. Throughout the day on Thursday, though, the value rose as high as $103,844. Here's how much a $1,000 investment in bitcoin made one, five or 10 years ago would be worth based on the digital currency's Dec. 5 midmorning price of $101,564, according to CNBC calculations. Here's how that compares with the S&P 500 index, which is often viewed as a benchmark of the overall stock market. One potential reason behind the surge may be some of Wall Street's key institutions' embrace of bitcoin. Several large investment firms including Invesco, BlackRock and Fidelity Investments launched the first spot bitcoin exchange traded funds in January. Since an ETF tracks the price of an underlying asset or index, bitcoin ETFs provide a way to invest, and benefit from potential price movements, without owning the cryptocurrency itself. With the availability of bitcoin ETFs, a larger number of investors can gain access to bitcoin. And as demand rises, so does the price, Douglas Boneparth, president of Bone Fide Wealth and a member of CNBC's Financial Advisor Council, told CNBC Make It on January 5. Bitcoin's value has fluctuated wildly over the past few years. The virtual currency hit an all-time high of $69,000 in November 2021, only to lose around 75% of its value following the collapse of FTX, the largest crypto exchange at the time, in November 2022. Since then, though, it has made a steady recovery and is up around 125% year over year, per CoinMetrics. While bitcoin is a cryptocurrency, all crypto isn't bitcoin. Experts warn against attempting to predict how other cryptocurrencies or meme coins may behave based on bitcoin's price movements. Cryptocurrencies are considered speculative assets and are prone to unexpected surges and drops in value. Unlike stocks, which represent partial ownership in a company, cryptocurrencies aren't backed by an underlying asset. That's why experts often warn against investing more than you're willing to lose. If you want to "try your luck" with crypto investing, consider opting for buying a bitcoin ETF through your brokerage account, James Royal, Bankrate's principal investing and wealth management analyst, told CNBC Make It in May. "The annual fees are reasonable, cheaper in most cases than actually buying the crypto yourself, and you're buying a coin that has the interest of institutional investors, so demand may remain robust," he said. If you feel you must have crypto in your portfolio, make it a small portion of your investments, Brian Vendig, president of MJP Wealth Advisors in Westport, Connecticut, told CNBC Make It in January. "I'd say 1% on the more conservative side, and no more than 5% of your total portfolio if you're a growth-focused investor," Vendig said. Want to make extra money outside of your day job?

Title: Goldman Sachs quits global climate coalition for banks

Manage your account By Simon Jessop and Virginia Furness LONDON (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs said it has quit a sector coalition aimed at aligning bank lending and investment activities with global efforts to fight climate change, becoming the most high-profile member to leave the group. The U.S. investment bank's decision comes against a backdrop of pressure from some Republican politicians who have suggested that membership of the Net-Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA) could breach anti-trust rules. Goldman Sachs gave no explicit reason for its departure, but focused on its strategy for the future and a growing push by regulators to make sustainability efforts mandatory. "We have the capabilities to achieve our goals and to support the sustainability objectives of our clients. Goldman Sachs is also very focused on the increasingly elevated sustainability standards and reporting requirements imposed by regulators around the world," it said in a statement on Friday. While it remains unclear what will happen to U.S. rules around climate-related company disclosures under President-elect Donald Trump, many large U.S. firms including Goldman Sachs will have to disclose under European Union rules. Banks joining the voluntary NZBA agree to align with the world's aim of reaching net-zero emissions by 2050, set targets to help get them there and publish progress on their efforts each year, something Goldman Sachs said it would continue to do. "We have made significant progress in recent years on the firm's net zero goals and we look forward to making further progress, including by expanding to additional sectors in the coming months," it said. "Our priorities remain to help our clients achieve their sustainability goals and to measure and report on our progress." A spokesperson for the NZBA declined to comment when contacted by Reuters. The bank said in 2019 it would deliver $750 billion of sustainable financing by 2030, and noted it had reached about 75% of this target in its 2023 sustainability report. CEO David Solomon reiterated Goldman's commitment to the energy sector in this report, saying the bank will continue to finance and advise clients in the sector, as well as invest in decarbonisation technologies. "We need to do both. It’s not an or, it’s an and," he wrote. The bank said it would align its financing activities to support a net zero target by 2050 and has set interim targets to help clients reduce carbon emissions in the energy, power and automotive sectors.
