Title: BlackRock-Backed Securitize Raises Strategic Funding From Jump Crypto

ByNina Bambysheva ByNina Bambysheva, Forbes Staff. Carlos Domingo, founder and CEO of Securitize Jump Crypto, the digital asset arm of Chicago quantitative trading firm Jump Trading, has taken a strategic stake in Miami-based Securitize, one of the leading platforms bringing real-world assets (RWAs) like Treasurys and private credit onto public blockchains. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. This is the first outside investment in Securitize since BlackRock’s $47 million round last year, which cemented the firm as a cornerstone of the fast-growing tokenization market. Other blue-chip asset managers, including Apollo, Hamilton Lane and KKR, have also tapped Securitize to issue blockchain-based funds. These aren’t fringe crypto experiments. The funds tokenize mainstream products including Treasurys, private credit, and private equity on blockchains like Ethereum and Solana. BlackRock’s BUIDL fund, the $10 trillion asset manager’s first blockchain-based vehicle, which also is Securitize’s marquee product, has become something of a bellwether of tokenization. Structured as a money market fund, it now manages $2.86 billion in assets. Since its debut just a little over a year ago, tokenized Treasury products have surged 800% to nearly $7 billion, a sign that the pitch is resonating with yield-hungry investors looking for alternatives to traditional wrappers. Michael Sonnenshein, COO at Securitize “We think that the market should be digesting this investment really as a signal that firms like Jump now have conviction in not only tokenization, but the role and the impact that tokenization is having on capital markets, capital formation and investment accessibility on chain,” says Michael Sonneshein, Securitize's COO and former CEO of crypto asset manager Grayscale. He argues that tokenization offers distinct advantages that legacy formats don’t match. Products like BUIDL, for instance, pay daily dividends, something traditional money market funds do not, and investors are increasingly choosing tokenized Treasurys over stablecoins as collateral, largely because tokenized products share yield with holders. In addition, pairing tokenized funds with decentralized finance opens new lending opportunities. Jump will help Securitize to do just that: expand the role of tokenized assets in collateral management and trading. The tokenization sector is growing fast. Since BUIDL’s launch, RWAs have more than doubled from about $9 billion in total value locked to $22.4 billion. Boston Consulting Group projects the tokenized asset market will balloon to $19 trillion by 2033. On Monday, the SEC's Crypto Task Force will host a roundtable on tokenization with issuers including Securitize. Meanwhile, the company is preparing its next act. In partnership with Lisbon-based Ethena Labs, it is about to launch a new blockchain called Converge. The idea is to create a compliant gateway for institutional capital into DeFi. Converge is expected to launch later this quarter.

Title: US and Russia seek ways to restore gas flows to Europe
URL: https://en.protothema.gr/2025/05/08/us-and-russia-seek-ways-to-restore-gas-flows-to-europe/
Time Published: 2025-05-08T14:47:30Z

Officials from Washington and Moscow held discussions on the U.S. contribution to reviving Russian natural gas sales to Europe, eight sources familiar with the content of the talks told Reuters. Sources close to the bilateral talks said that carving out a renewed role for Moscow in the European Union’s gas market could help cement a peace deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Although much of Europe has sought alternative supplies, some buyers have remained, and industry officials say more could return once a peace deal is in place. As for Russia, nothing has hurt its economy more than the loss of most of the European gas market three years ago. Today Russia supplies 19% of Europe’s demand, up from 40%, consisting mostly of liquefied natural gas (LNG) and some of it piped through Turkey via the TurkStream pipeline. Washington’s involvement in restoring gas sales could help Moscow overcome political opposition in much of Europe. U.S. involvement would also benefit Washington by offering it the ability to see and possibly control to some extent the volumes of Russian gas that return to Europe, two diplomatic sources and a White House source said. From 2022, Europe has turned to other gas suppliers, including U.S. exports of liquefied natural gas (LNG). U.S. envoy Steve Whitcoff and Putin’s investment envoy, Kirill Dmitriev, have discussed gas as part of the Ukraine peace talks, two of the eight sources said. Whitkov’s spokesman declined to comment when asked if they had discussed the issue of Russian gas exports to Europe. “At present, there are no such discussions,” Russia’s Direct Investment Fund, which Dmitriev heads, said in a statement to Reuters. As for how the Americans could get involved, five sources said that in talks so far there has been talk of U.S. investors taking stakes in the Nord Stream pipeline linking Russia to Germany, or in the pipeline crossing Ukraine, or in Gazprom itself. U.S. companies could also serve as buyers, purchasing gas from Gazprom and sending it to Europe, including Germany, the sources said. Two of the sources said diplomatic talks involving potential U.S. investors also considered the idea of a U.S. buyer taking Russian gas and then exporting it to Europe as a way to mitigate European political opposition to resuming supplies. BlackRock, Vanguard and Capital Group each own 1-2% of Gazprom. BlackRock, Vanguard and Gazprom did not respond to requests for comment. Capital Group declined to comment. The European Commission declined to comment. Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has expressed opposition to a return to Russian energy supplies. “Some people still say we need to turn on the tap of Russian gas and oil again. This would be a mistake of historic proportions and we will never let it happen,” she told a European Parliament meeting on May 7. “Russia has proven, time and again, that it is not a reliable supplier.” Brussels wants to ban new Russian gas deals by the end of 2025 and ban imports under existing deals by the end of 2027. The plan, which will be debated next month, will require the approval of the European Parliament and a majority of member states. Hungary and Slovakia have expressed their opposition to the move. Trump has said he hopes for a peace deal on Ukraine soon and expects this will pave the way for both Russia and Ukraine to do major business with the U.S. Russia is ready to restart gas exports to Europe immediately if there is political will to do so, Putin said. Kiev and Washington signed a U.S.-Ukraine mineral deal on April 30 that would include all natural resource assets and infrastructure owned by the Ukrainian government, but did not explicitly mention the pipeline. “If this level of engagement between Russia and the US continues, it is very likely that there will be a resumption of Russian gas flows… involving US intermediaries,” a person familiar with the discussions said. Gazprom, keen to revive its European sales, is considering offering German customers short-term 24-month contracts and big discounts on prices, two sources said. It has traditionally asked buyers to sign decades-old contracts, the two sources noted. However, the EU remains broadly opposed and there are other hurdles to overcome. There are numerous legal cases pending regarding violations of old contracts.

Thursday, 08 May 2025 FILE PHOTO: A general view of the Leuna-Harze plant, a producer of chemical industry commodities, at the InfraLeuna industrial site, in Leuna, Germany, April 2, 2025. REUTERS/Lisi Niesner LONDON/MOSCOW (Reuters) -With a frost covering Europe's energy relations with Russia, officials from Washington and Moscow have held discussions about the U.S. helping to revive Russian gas sales to the continent, eight sources familiar with the talks have told Reuters. Europe slashed its imports of Russian gas following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, a move that saw Russian exporter Gazprom post a $7 billion loss the following year. U.S. President Donald Trump is pushing for peace in Ukraine, raising the prospects of a thaw in gas ties. Sources close to the bilateral discussions said carving out a renewed role for Moscow in the European Union's gas market could help cement a peace deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Though much of Europe has sought alternative supply, some buyers have remained, and industry officials say more could return once a peace deal is agreed.

Washington's involvement in restoring the gas sales could help Moscow navigate political opposition in much of Europe.

Witkoff's spokesperson declined to comment when asked if he discussed the issue of Russian gas exports to Europe. "Currently, there are no such discussions," Russia's Direct Investment Fund, headed by Dmitriev, said in a statement to Reuters. Gazprom would consider selling gas to Europe if a new owner took control of the gas network between Russia and Europe, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told French magazine Le Point in April. On the route crossing the Baltic Sea Gazprom controls the two twin pipelines of Nord Stream 1 and 2 backed by European firms which hold stakes. Moscow is ready to trade its gas and knows that some European countries still want to buy it, Peskov said in the Le Point interview. "There is a gas seller, there are potential buyers," Peskov told reporters in April. Countries still buying include Hungary and Slovakia which receive gas through the TurkStream pipeline. Belgium, France, the Netherlands, and Spain get LNG from Russia's Novatek under long-term contracts. Regarding how the Americans might get involved, five sources said talks to date have discussed U.S. investors taking stakes in the Nord Stream pipeline connecting Russia and Germany, or in the pipeline crossing Ukraine, or in Gazprom itself.U.S. firms could also serve as the buyers, purchasing gas from Gazprom and shipping it to Europe, including to Germany, the sources said.

Gazprom, keen to resurrect its European sales, is considering offering German clients short-term 24-month contracts and steep price discounts, two sources said. Traditionally it has asked buyers to sign contracts lasting decades, two sources noted. HURDLES Yet the EU remains broadly opposed, and there are other hurdles to overcome. There are numerous legal cases hanging over breaches of legacy contracts. The Nord Stream pipelines were damaged in a sabotage attack in September 2022. Three of the four pipes were ruptured, leaving just one still able to pump gas. The war in Ukraine has also changed the situation, with Russian attacks damaging pipelines crossing Ukraine, though the key transit route remains in working order. A more technical matter is that Nord Stream 2 also never received German government approval to begin sending gas to Germany, a spokesperson from Germany's economy and energy ministry noted, declining to comment further.

Not long ago, President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva met me in his office in Brasília and told me that he’d had a disturbing dream. In recent months, Lula had turned seventy-nine and undergone emergency surgery for a brain hemorrhage, and although he seemed fit and healthy when we met, he was in a reflective mood. He’d dreamed the night before about his predecessor José Sarney, who is now ninety-four years old. Sarney is a cherished figure in Brazil: in the nineteen-eighties, he became the country’s first President to take office after two decades of military rule. “In my dream, he came to my house and slept on the floor, and in the morning I made him breakfast,” Lula said. “I woke up worried, wondering if something had happened to him during the night.” The LedeReporting and commentary on what you need to know today. Sarney turned out to be fine, but it is no accident that Lula was concerned about an emblem of democracy. He told me that the entire Western system felt imperilled. “The democracy we learned to live with after World War Two, the functioning of multilateralism as an important role in relations between states, the respect for diversity, the sovereignty of each country is now fading,” he said. “What comes next, we don’t know.” The entire post-Second World War order, created largely through the intervention of the United States, seemed on the verge of collapse. “We thought we were creating a more civilized, more solidarity-based, more humane society,” he said. “The result is worse. It’s as if there is a lamp, and when you open the lid the evil people come out.” Lula has built a career on unwavering leftist principles, but he has also long prided himself on his ability to get along with a variety of leaders. Now, though, he confessed that he was flummoxed by the right-wing populists and anti-globalists gaining power around the world. At the United Nations General Assembly last September, he’d tried to organize a meeting of progressive Presidents. “When we sat down to make the list, I discovered there were no more progressives!” he said. In Latin America, only a small group of left-leaning leaders remains, including Gustavo Petro, of Colombia, Gabriel Boric, of Chile, and Claudia Sheinbaum, of Mexico. “In order to keep the meeting from being too small, I changed ‘progressives’ to ‘democrats,’ so I could invite Biden, Macron, and other people,” Lula explained. “We’ve had two meetings since then, to discuss how to create a narrative to justify the importance of the democratic system as the best thing ever created for humanity’s coexistence—a system with rules, where everyone has rights, and someone’s rights end when they infringe on the rights of others. It’s what worked in the world. Monarchies, empires—they didn’t work. Nazism didn’t work. Stalin’s communism didn’t work.” In his country and in the U.S., he suggested, large portions of the populace seemed to have lost their grip on reality. “There are people who believe things that everyone should understand are lies, because they are so absurd,” he told me. “And my concern is how we are going to build a narrative to destroy this.” The troubling thing, he said, is that “we still don’t have an answer.” Part of the problem was economic, he said. “Democracy starts to fall when it no longer meets the people’s interests. Since 1980, the working people in countries that built welfare states have only lost, while income concentration has increased. So what response can we give to Brazilian society? And to German and American society?” There was also a question of leadership. “The U.S. was the mirror of democracy, the pillar of democracy for the planet,” he said. “Despite being the country that wages the most wars, it’s the country that talks the most about peace, the most about democracy. And yet now there is Trump, who sometimes behaves like—” Lula stopped himself, then continued. “I saw a speech of his in the U.S. Congress recently, and it was absurd—those Republicans clapping at whatever nonsense he said. It was almost the same kind of speech that anarchists used to make in Italy and Brazil at the beginning of the century, calling for a society without institutions, a society where the empire of capital rules.” President Donald Trump made clear his interventionist intentions toward Latin America as soon as he resumed office; in his Inaugural Address, he vowed to “retake” the Panama Canal. Since then, most leaders in the region have handled Washington with elaborate care. The right-wing populists strained to display their loyalty and affinity. Javier Milei—a hard-line libertarian who has slashed away half of Argentina’s government ministries—gave Elon Musk an engraved chainsaw and hailed Trump as “one of the two most relevant politicians on planet Earth.” (The other, of course, being Milei.) He has been rewarded with U.S. support for a twenty-billion-dollar International Monetary Fund loan, and with praise from Trump, who has said that Milei is doing “a fantastic job.” In El Salvador, President Nayib Bukele offered to allow the U.S. to deport its undesirable migrants to his country, to be held in an appalling hellhole of a prison. When Bukele recently visited the Oval Office, he and Trump traded smug jokes about their arrangement, with Trump saying that he’d like to send “homegrowns,” too, and Bukele scoffing at the suggestion that he would return the wrongly deported migrant Kilmar Abrego Garcia to the U.S. Among the region’s leftist leaders, Colombia’s Petro was the first to resist Trump. After refusing to permit U.S. military planes carrying deportees to land in Colombia, he suggested on social media that Trump was a “white slaveowner,” while comparing himself to Colonel Aureliano Buendía, the doomed hero of “One Hundred Years of Solitude.” Trump retaliated by announcing punishing tariffs and a sweeping prohibition on U.S. visas for Colombian officials. Within hours, Petro had relented, and his humiliation provided an object lesson for other leaders. In March, a Hong Kong-based company named CK Hutchison Holdings agreed to sell its ports on the Panama Canal to a consortium led by the American investment company BlackRock. Trump quickly claimed that he was effectively reasserting control over the canal. Panama’s President, José Raúl Mulino, tried to salvage his dignity with defiant public statements, but he has mostly succumbed to pressure from D.C. Last month, Panama and the U.S. signed an expanded security-coöperation agreement that allows American armed forces to occupy several former military bases along the Canal Zone. In a joint statement on the new security relationship, released during a visit by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, a sentence acknowledging U.S. respect for Panama’s sovereignty was pointedly excluded from the English-language version. Panamanians have grown frustrated. An influential friend there wrote to me, “Mulino has not stopped giving his ass to Trump at every turn, in exchange for nothing.” Mexico’s President, Claudia Sheinbaum, has made more convincing displays of composure, but she, too, has avoided confrontations with Trump by giving him what he wants. As my colleague Stephania Taladrid detailed recently, these efforts have included stepping up Mexico’s security presence at the border, handing over high-level narco-traffickers to the U.S., and significantly increasing seizures of fentanyl. Even Venezuela’s would-be revolutionary leader, President Nicolás Maduro, congratulated Trump for returning to the White House and agreed to hand over American prisoners from his country’s jails. After the Trump Administration deported hundreds of alleged Venezuelan gang members to Bukele’s prison, Maduro issued a statement denouncing the action as “fascism”—but he was careful to address it to Bukele directly, rather than to Trump. Lula and Chile’s Boric have been the most outspoken Latin American leaders. On a recent state visit to India, Boric described Trump’s Inauguration, with Big Tech billionaires “paying fealty to a new wannabe emperor,” as reminiscent of “something from another era.” He criticized the tariffs as “irrational” and “unsustainable.” Although his country’s main export commodity, copper, had so far been exempted, Boric promised to seek out new trade deals with India, Japan, and others. He warned that if Trump did place tariffs on Chile’s copper—eleven per cent of which went to the U.S. last year—the higher cost would ultimately be passed on to American consumers. “The law of the strongest has short legs,” he said. Lula knows that his coalition is thin. In a recent speech, he said, “The Presidents of South American countries should understand that we are very weak if we are isolated.” When I saw him in Brasília, he made a plea for greater international coöperation. “We have to convince the world that it’s not possible to end multilateralism,” he said. “Multilateralism was a form of civility found among states to coexist peacefully, with rules that everyone must follow,” he went on. “It’s already proven that, if we don’t control the air, everyone will be a victim of air pollution. If the sea rises, everyone will be a victim. It hasn’t yet reached the world’s most important leaders that we need global governance to make some decisions globally.” Lula noted that the environment was among the most pressing global issues, but he also acknowledged the limits of multilateralism in dealing with it. This year, Brazil will host the COP30 climate conference, in the city of Belém—a location, at the edge of the Amazon, chosen to bring attention to the crisis of deforestation. Yet it is hard to imagine that it will bring radical change. European countries in particular seem likely to donate less as they scramble to devote more of their budgets to military expenditures. Lula shrugged this off. “I do not believe in money from developed countries,” he said. “They promised a hundred billion dollars in 2009, and they have not yet delivered. It has been sixteen years. Now the need is 1.3 trillion dollars—and they will not deliver.” Lula advocated a world in which the major powers could compete without resorting to warfare, and in which they coöperated more closely on such priorities as hunger and climate change. It was not lost on him that Brazil, as a developing economy, depends on maintaining friendly relations, even when it means partnering with countries with wildly divergent value systems. “We need to say: thank goodness we have China that, from a technological perspective, is very advanced and can compete in the technological world of A.I., giving us an alternative for this debate,” he said. In his telling, Western powers’ animosity toward China was spurred by trade, not by its human-rights abuses or its threats to invade Taiwan. “I am from a generation that learned in the nineteen-eighties, through Reagan and Margaret Thatcher, that the best thing for the world was globalization and free trade. Products should flow freely across the world. Money should flow freely across the world.” China, he said, had merely adopted this theory along with everyone else. “China started producing everything that was produced in the U.S. and Europe. You couldn’t buy a single pair of pants, shoes, or a shirt that didn’t say ‘Made in China.’ They very skillfully copied everything and learned how to produce things as well or better. Now that the Chinese have become competitive, they have become the world’s enemies,” he added testily. “And we don’t accept that. We don’t accept the idea of a second Cold War. We accept the idea that the more similar countries are—technologically and militarily advanced—the more they must talk to each other, because I’m not sure the planet can handle a Third World War.” Lula insists on pacifism in an idealistic way that is unusual among world leaders. “Last year, the world spent $2.4 trillion on weapons, while seven hundred and thirty million people go to sleep every night not knowing if they’ll have breakfast when they wake up,” he said. “That should be humanity’s main concern.” Even after Russia invaded Ukraine, he resisted taking sides. He described a recent meeting with the German Chancellor: “My friend Olaf Scholz came here, sat on that couch, and asked Brazil to sell missiles to him so he could send them to Ukraine. I told him I wouldn’t sell, with all due respect, because I didn’t want any Ukrainian or Russian to die with a Brazilian weapon.” Like some others on the left (and many on the right), he criticized the U.S. and Europe for funding efforts to confront Putin in Ukraine. “When you corner the enemy, you need to have the strength to defeat that enemy, and it’s not easy to defeat Russia,” Lula said. “I discussed this with Biden. And Biden kept saying, ‘We’re going to destroy Putin, and he’ll have to rebuild Ukraine.’ What’s going to happen now? If peace happens, organized by Trump, he will win the Nobel Peace Prize, and Europe will have to pay for NATO, will have to finance the war, and will have to rebuild Ukraine.” A few weeks earlier, Lula had urged Russia to halt the war. “I called Putin and I said, ‘Putin, I think it’s time for you to return to politics. Put an end to this. The world needs politics, not war. You’re missed. There are not enough people to sit around the table and discuss the fate of the planet: What do we want for humanity?’ ” Lula ridiculed Trump’s desire to take over Greenland and Canada. “The only thing left for him to take over is Antarctica,” he said. “Why do Russia and the U.S. want to increase their territories if they can’t even manage what they already have?” In his view, the global posturing by Trump, Vice-President J. D. Vance, and Musk was a serious threat. “They are deniers of the institutions that guarantee democracy worldwide,” he said. “The fact that the U.S. Vice-President interferes in Germany’s politics is already a crime. I have never gone to another country to interfere in an election!” He suggested that the bellicose rhetoric would eventually harm them. “At first, it may look good,” he said. “But the result could be much worse than what they are criticizing. When you release a wild beast, afterward you don’t know how to control it.” Not long before we talked, the U.S. government had announced a twenty-five-per-cent tariff on Brazilian steel. “There will be reciprocity,” Lula said. “But, before there is reciprocity, we want to show the U.S. what two hundred years of diplomatic and commercial relations between Brazil and the U.S. represents.” He pointed out that the U.S. had a seven-billion-dollar trade surplus with Brazil last year, the steel imports included. “What the U.S. imports from Brazil, they transform and then export back to Brazil,” he said. “It’s a two-way street, so I think this will be harmful to the U.S. For our part, we want to negotiate diplomatically. If there’s no possibility, we will take action.” When I asked Lula if Trump had reached out to him, he said no. “If, as a representative of the American state, he wants to talk to Lula, the representative of the Brazilian state, I will talk to him calmly,” he said. “But so far I haven’t had any interest in talking to him, either. If I ever have a problem and need to call him, I will call him.” ♦

Title: BlackRock reveals $32 million Q1 revenue from Bitcoin IBIT ETF in new SEC filing

IBIT’s quarterly disclosure highlights inflows despite Bitcoin’s 11.15% price drop and evolving custody framework. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. It’s been a big quarter for BlackRock’s Shares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) with new custodians, Bitcoin volatility, a new regulatory landscape, and a pro-Bitcoin president. In its latest quarterly filing, BlackRock reported $47.78 billion in net assets at the end of Q1 2025, a decrease from $51.52 billion in the previous quarter. This decline tracks Bitcoin’s 11.15% price fall during the same period, affirming the ETF’s direct correlation to Bitcoin market performance. While Bitcoin’s price retreat impacted net asset value (NAV), the Trust’s underlying demand remained intact. Share issuances outpaced redemptions by 43 million during the quarter. The total number of outstanding shares reached 1.013 billion, reflecting sustained institutional interest despite market volatility. The NAV per share fell to $47.14 from $53.09. The largest NAV point during Q1 was $60.61 on January 21, with the lowest at $44.62 on March 10. However, as of press time, IBIT is trading at $56 in pre-market as Bitcoin attempts to reclaim $100,000. Operational costs during the quarter were modest relative to asset size. Sponsor fees totaled $33.04 million. BlackRock’s promotional fee waiver for the first $5 billion in AUM at a reduced rate of 0.12% cost the Trust $178,082 during the quarter, though this concession expired in January 2025. Coinbase Custody remained the Trust’s primary Bitcoin custodian. However, BlackRock expanded its custody framework in April 2025, appointing Anchorage Digital Bank under a new custodial services agreement. The move is to add redundancy to safeguard against counterparty and operational risks, especially as Coinbase has faced regulatory challenges. Notably, the SEC’s lawsuit against Coinbase was dismissed in February 2025, which removed near-term legal uncertainty around the Trust’s key service provider. Market structure risks also surfaced throughout the filing. BlackRock detailed that Bitcoin sold to fund share redemptions resulted in $624 million in realized gains, evidencing the Trust’s liquidity efficiency. Nevertheless, the document extensively outlined regulatory and security vulnerabilities, including exposure to custody losses, market manipulation, and global regulatory shifts. U.S. initiatives such as President Trump’s March 2025 executive order creating a “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve” and pending congressional legislation to acquire 1 million Bitcoin over five years were noted as potential market catalysts and risks. The Trust’s custodial and counterparty arrangements are subject to liability limitations. Insurance policies maintained by Coinbase and Anchorage may be insufficient to cover extreme loss scenarios. Lastly, the ETF’s exposure to ongoing regulatory evolution remains central. The filing cited rising scrutiny from U.S. and global authorities, including FinCEN’s proposed rules on digital asset mixers and OFAC’s ongoing enforcement, as factors that could affect liquidity and market access. Ultimately, IBIT’s quarterly disclosure highlights a balance between robust inflows and market-related NAV compression, while offering an extensive view into how BlackRock manages structural, regulatory, and operational risks in the digital asset landscape.

Title: Bitcoin defies doubts at $98K, so why are investors still cautious?

BTC surges amid hopeful ETF inflows, but the market is still on edge. Despite Bitcoin’s [BTC] impressive hold above the $98K mark, investor sentiment has taken a sharp turn lower. This brings along a wave of doubt that feels oddly out of place in a bull market. Is the market caught in disbelief, priming for a euphoric breakout? Or do these signals mirror the 2022 bear market? With BTC’s recent surge reigniting momentum, the current climate may be driven as much by psychology as by fundamentals. Recent data revealed a striking divergence between Bitcoin’s price and prevailing sentiment on X (formerly Twitter) and news platforms. Even with BTC trading confidently above $98K, the 7-day average sentiment remained firmly negative – a pattern historically associated with local bottoms and contrarian buying opportunities. Source: Alphractal This persistent disbelief suggests that the market is psychologically lagging behind price action. While such sentiment drops have previously preceded bullish reversals, it’s worth remembering the cautionary tale of 2022, where extended negativity coincided with a prolonged bear phase. A sharp shift is visible on the ETF flow chart: after weeks of consistent outflows, April ushered in a regime of substantial spot ETF inflows. This renewed institutional interest, primarily led by giants like BlackRock and Fidelity, appears to have reignited Bitcoin’s upward momentum, pushing it past the $98K mark. Source: Glassnode Unlike the volatile flows of earlier months, this phase shows steady daily net inflows, signaling strong long-term conviction. Institutional confidence may be the key force behind the surge, even as retail sentiment remains cautious. While ETF inflows signal optimism, history reminds investors to stay cautious. In 2022, bullish sentiment, driven by institutional products and macro trends, collapsed due to liquidity shocks and excess leverage. A sudden shift in risk appetite or regulatory pressures could trigger rapid outflows, reversing recent gains. Although ETFs offer transparency, they don’t shield Bitcoin from market volatility. If inflows slow or turn to redemptions, Bitcoin could face sell-offs similar to past cycles.

Title: Bitcoin network activity drops to bear market levels – Red flag or buy signal?

Time Published: 2025-05-08T00:00:28Z
Full Content:
Bitcoin’s low volatility and institutional support hint at potential growth despite bearish signals. Bitcoin [BTC] network activity has dropped to bear market levels since December 2024, as the Network Activity Index has sharply declined. This indicates a slowdown in transaction activity and a decrease in daily active addresses, signaling lower demand for block space. While this pattern is typical during bear markets or specific events like the China ban in 2021, it may not necessarily be a red flag. While the market may appear weak, the influx of institutional confidence may help stabilize BTC in the long term. At press time, Bitcoin was trading at $96,998.87, reflecting a 2.91% increase over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin’s volatility has decreased to 25.80%, its lowest level in the past thirty days. This period of low volatility could suggest that the market is experiencing a temporary calm before any significant price movements. Historically, such periods of low volatility are often followed by sudden price shifts, whether upward or downward. Given the recent price increase, the market may be preparing for another volatile phase, especially with the upcoming FOMC meeting potentially influencing broader market sentiment. Source: IntoTheBlock At the time of writing, BTC was testing key resistance at $98K, with Fibonacci retracement levels indicating critical price action. The 0.236 and 0.382 retracement levels at $95,656 and $96,347 are key areas of interest, while the 50% and 61.8% levels at $94,799 and $92,171 provide potential support zones. The Stochastic RSI was at 41.55, signaling neutral conditions, with room for both upward and downward movement. A successful breakout above $98K would likely target the $100K mark, but failure to breach this level could lead to a pullback, making $90K and $92K the key support zones. Source: TradingView Bitcoin ETF inflows have been robust, with a total of $5.13 billion entering BTC ETF products over the last three weeks. These inflows signal strong institutional confidence in Bitcoin, even as retail activity slows. However, the upcoming FOMC meeting could introduce market volatility, as any adjustments in interest rates or commentary from the Federal Reserve could impact investor sentiment. Despite this uncertainty, the inflows into BTC ETFs suggest that institutional investors remain optimistic about Bitcoin’s long-term potential. Source: Santiment Whale activity has surged recently, with institutional investors like BlackRock purchasing 280 BTC worth $37.8 million and Metaplanet adding 555 BTC. These purchases indicate that large holders are betting on Bitcoin’s future growth, and their actions could signal confidence in the asset, even amid uncertain market conditions. Despite bear market signals, BTC’s price action, along with institutional inflows and whale activity, suggests potential growth. With low volatility, major resistance at $98K, and institutional confidence rising, BTC may be gearing up for another upward move. However, the market’s direction will depend on BTC’s response to key price levels and the upcoming FOMC meeting, which could impact investor sentiment.

(ABC News: Lucas Hill) The future for staff and children at Genius childcare centres remains in doubt as the financially stricken company searches for new buyers. Administrators are still processing hundreds of enquiries from potential buyers, in an attempt to recoup huge debts owed. Genius remains embroiled in several legal battles over allegation over unpaid rent and wages. The fate of childcare centres looking after more than 1,100 children remains uncertain after administrators warned they may have to shut them down if they can't find a buyer. Centres run by the stricken Genius childcare empire are on the market after they were taken over by administrators, WLP Restructuring, in March following years of accusations by workers of wage underpayment and financial mismanagement. In an affidavit filed with the Federal Court last month, the administrators said they had already closed eight of 18 centres that two Genius companies operated when they collapsed, despite getting a $1 million cash injection from funder Finexia to keep trading. They warned they may have to close the remaining centres, leaving the children without daycare and tipping more than 200 workers out of their jobs, if they can't find a buyer. Centres may be forced to close, leaving hundreds of children without daycare. (ABC Kimberley: Ted O'Connor) Parent Kahri D'Este, whose two children are enrolled at a Genius centre in Conder in the ACT, said she is holding out hope that the centre stays open. "If it goes under — which I honestly think is highly likely — then we will have no care," she said. "We don't have any other option, it's not easy to get care here, everywhere has a waiting list for months." Ms D'Este said despite the ongoing threat of the centre suddenly shutting down, the "amazing staff" have kept her from walking away. "I cannot believe that the educators, who have stuck through it this whole way, could just be dropped like hot potatoes," she said. "There are so many good staff here, and they work their butts off, and they have been treated so badly." The administrators had intended to secure a new buyer by last week, but were still processing more than 400 enquiries from interested parties. The sale of the centres is intended to recoup the huge debts owed by companies in the Genius group, which currently stand at as much as $88 million and are forecast to grow as more creditors emerge. Potential buyers include Gold Coast-based Finexia, where Genius owner Darren Misquitta was until recently the biggest shareholder, but which has become embroiled in Genius's financial downfall. ASX-listed Finexia was forced to freeze its childcare fund in February and last month revealed to investors that more than a fifth of the fund's money was tied up in loans that were in default. Minutes from administrators' meetings with creditors reveal Finexia is chasing Genius over a loan worth more than $24 million, but Finexia has not formally informed investors of the dollar value of its loans to Genius. Finexia offers loans to childcare providers, and has provided funding to Genius. (Finexia) However, it has told the market of the sudden resignation of interim chief executive Marc Duncan last week, who had been at the helm since February when Executive Director and chief executive Patrick Bell left without warning after four years. The company is currently suspended from the exchange. Executive chairman Neil Sheather did not answer questions about Finexia's transactions with Genius. He told the ABC a company run by Mr Misquitta, Sprint Capital Partners, became Finexia's biggest shareholder in 2023 after a capital raising. Finexia's 2023 annual report shows Sprint owned 11.4 per cent of the company. But Mr Sheather said Sprint divested the holding after Finexia raised concerns about a potential conflict of interest. "What became clear to us at Finexia was that this was not the relationship we wanted," he said. Another potential buyer is Steps Early Learning, which has for months been poised to take over ten Genius centres. Steps, which is run by Mr Misquitta's former business partner Ashok Naveinthiran, had in April not yet received the critical provider approval required by ACECQA to be authorised to run childcare centres. Despite that, administrators said they had received more than $278,600 in childcare subsidies Steps had been paid since March. In the meantime, administrators are also investigating a string of transactions made by Genius companies' bank accounts, including transfers made in the days immediately before the administrators were appointed along with "payments to or at the direction of Mr Misquitta" and "payments to other third parties of at least $500,000". According to the affidavit, the results of those investigations will help determine whether Mr Misquitta contravened his director duties and allowed the companies to trade while insolvent. Genius Childcare owner Darren Misquitta remains at the centre of an investigation launched by administrators. (LinkedIn) Separately, an interim report by a different administrator responsible for a third Genius company known as Horizontal 1 Pty Ltd, said initial investigations suggested the company had not been able to pay its debts since as early as June 30, 2020. Genius is also embroiled in a legal stoush with global fund management giant Blackrock, with the company taking action in the Federal Court in November 2024 over more than $1.2 million in unpaid rent. The same month, the United Workers Union launched proceedings against Genius companies and Mr Misquitta claiming underpayment of superannuation and failure to pay wages to workers on time. That case has been temporarily paused pending the administration process. Mr Misquitta did not respond to the ABC's questions.

Title: Mark Carney’s Sustainability Goals Could Reshape Canadian Real Estate

ByAli Hoss ByAli Hoss, Contributor. Could Carney's Climate Strategies Provide Competitive advantages in Canada's commercial Real Estate? Canada stands at a pivotal juncture in its sustainability journey, marked by the recent emergence of Prime Minister Mark Carney. As the nation transitions from traditional carbon taxation to a nuanced incentive-based climate strategy, commercial real estate stakeholders must carefully consider the implications of these substantial policy shifts. Carney’s ambitious plans present both considerable opportunities and complex challenges for the Canadian commercial property sector. This transition is further accentuated by evolving sustainability standards across Canada, driven by the urgent imperative to reposition soon-to-be stranded assets. Stakeholders must thoughtfully navigate these interconnected dynamics, capitalizing on emerging incentives and adapting proactively to maintain competitiveness and resilience. Canada’s evolving sustainability strategy under Carney’s leadership will undoubtedly impact the commercial real estate sector. It looks like 2025 marks the beginning of a new regulatory landscape. Historically, Canada’s approach to climate change mitigation and adaptation centered heavily on a consumer-facing carbon tax, designed to incentivize sustainable choices through direct financial costs. However, Carney’s administration has significantly shifted this approach, eliminating consumer carbon pricing in favor of targeted incentives and enhanced industrial regulation. Carney’s strategy retains carbon pricing mechanisms for large industrial emitters, thus continuing to leverage regulatory pressures effectively within heavy industries. Canada’s new policy notably emphasizes the importance of maintaining the nation’s global competitiveness through the introduction of a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism. This tariff not only discourages companies from relocating to countries with weaker climate regulations, but also equalizes costs associated with carbon-intensive production. This allows businesses in countries committed to ambitious climate targets to remain competitive internationally. For commercial real estate owners and operators, this raises intriguing questions: How might these industrial regulations indirectly influence property investment markets, particularly in regions heavily dependent on manufacturing, logistics, or resource extraction? Could CBAM indirectly alter property values or tenant demand patterns, compelling developers and investors to reassess site location, procurement strategies, and performance benchmarks? The results remain to be seen. Carney’s climate initiatives are also focused on incentives for the adoption of sustainable technologies, including a 31% credit rate for eligible properties acquired after January 1, 2024. The additional expansion of subsidies for electric vehicles, heat pumps, efficiency retrofits, and renewable energy installations promises to accelerate Canada’s transition to a low-carbon economy. These subsidies offer the commercial real estate sector tangible financial incentives to integrate cutting-edge sustainability technologies into building design and operations. Furthermore, direct government support, such as Canada Infrastructure Bank’s Building Retrofits Initiative, will likely create favorable conditions for developers investing in sustainable construction and retrofits. Carney’s administration has explicitly committed to accelerating project approvals, such as a $175 million investment in the Hudson Bay Railway and the Port of Churchill, especially projects related to critical minerals and clean-energy infrastructure. We should also take into account the Building Emission Performance Standards, which set explicit emissions performance benchmarks for commercial buildings, incentivizing efficiency upgrades, renewable energy integration, and electrification. However, BEPS implementation poses challenges as well, especially regarding upfront retrofit costs. Cities like Vancouver address affordability concerns through targeted financial incentives and technical assistance programs, ensuring equitable compliance pathways for diverse stakeholders. Although solutions will vary across provinces, the nation-wide policy direction raises questions about whether proactive engagement in sustainability initiatives will led to competitive advantages in tenant attraction, operational cost management, or long-term asset valuation. The nonprofit Green Communities Canada released a report in April 2025 projecting that eco-friendly retrofits could save Canadians $3.8 billion over the next 20 years for at least half a million Canadian households. Perhaps most significantly, Carney’s advocacy for mandatory emissions disclosures, including Scope 3 emissions, and for structured frameworks guiding financial institutions toward sustainable investments, is expected to have widespread across the Canadian economy. His renowned maxim, "What gets measured gets managed," encapsulates his belief in data-driven transparency as a catalyst for environmental action. Real estate finance, inherently reliant on institutional lending and capital markets, stands to experience substantial shifts under these new financial sector guidelines. Mandatory climate risk disclosures could alter investment attractiveness, reshape lending practices, and influence asset valuation methodologies. Regulatory frameworks like Vancouver’s Climate Emergency Action Plan impose stringent emissions caps, substantial fines, and progressive tightening of standards. Buildings failing these benchmarks face diminished financing options, lower valuations, and decreased tenant appeal. In this regulatory landscape, institutional investors increasingly prioritize sustainability performance metrics, suggesting an evolving landscape where properties demonstrating superior environmental credentials will likely command valuation and rent premiums. Moreover, financial institutions and investors increasingly categorize assets failing sustainability standards as high-risk investments. Given the significant economic disruptions accompanying recent tariffs and international trade tensions, substantial stimulus investment in sustainable infrastructure, including commercial real estate, could deliver multifaceted economic benefits. For example, directing governmental funding toward sustainable commercial developments in urban cores might simultaneously stimulate economic recovery and address critical urban housing shortages through mixed-use projects. On the other hand, while Carney’s vision presents substantial opportunities, it also introduces complexities and potential risks. Carney’s historical emphasis on voluntary industry collaboration, such as the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero and Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, underscores a preference for cooperative rather than strictly regulatory frameworks. However, voluntary approaches alone might be insufficient, as their effectiveness can be undermined by subjective interpretations with a high risk of greenwashing. For instance, in recent months, four of Canada’s largest banks have withdrawn from the United Nations-backed Net-Zero Banking Alliance, an initiative specifically designed to accelerate climate action within the financial sector. This trend is mirrored in the U.S., where several major banks and leading asset management firms, such as BlackRock and Vanguard, also stepped away from prominent climate-focused asset manager alliances. These departures highlight the fragility of voluntary climate commitments and reinforce the need for robust, binding policies to promote transparency and accountability. Looking ahead, the shift from consumer carbon taxation toward structured incentives, financial market reforms, and integrated societal solutions positions real estate as a critical player in Canada’s sustainability journey. Carney’s proposed framework underscores the intricate balance between environmental stewardship, economic pragmatism, and social responsibility. For the commercial real estate industry, navigating this new paradigm will require strategic foresight, proactive adaptation, and collaborative engagement with both public and private stakeholders. As Canada embarks upon this ambitious sustainability trajectory, commercial real estate professionals must thoughtfully consider their roles, responsibilities, and opportunities. By proactively integrating sustainability into strategic decision-making the industry can not only thrive economically but also significantly contribute to Canada's sustainable future. This could be achieved through leveraging emerging incentives, adapting to regulatory complexities, embracing technology, and aligning with broader societal goal. Ultimately, the effectiveness of Carney’s vision will depend on its successful translation into actionable policies, transparent governance, and genuine stakeholder collaboration. For Canadian commercial real estate, this represents an unprecedented opportunity to lead by example, demonstrating how visionary climate policy can underpin enduring economic resilience and environmental sustainability.
