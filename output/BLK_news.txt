Evidence pointing to a late November election continues to pile up, despite the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste’s increasingly wan insistence that it will be happening next year. If the fervent wishes of all those in Leinster House were enough to influence a decision, it would be called tomorrow. RTÉ’s Fiachra Ó Cionnaith’s tweeted a telltale photo this week of pallets of Fianna Fáil election posters shrink-wrapped with hundreds of smiling Micheál Martins and a slogan on the front plaintively whispering “Moving Forward Together” and “With Whoever Will Have Us” on the reverse. And as the parties attempt to stuff as much money into the coffers as possible before the election is called, Fine Gael supporters are noting with interest that the date of its Superdraw money-raising lottery has been brought forward from December 5th. There is major deck-clearing going on in Government Buildings. Sinn Féin is currently banjaxed. Jennifer Bray reports elsewhere on its latest catastrophe where they’re tearing the party to shreds in Kildare. Oh, and here’s what some see as the clincher. The Late Late Toy Show airs this year on December 6th, with “insiders” swearing that programme planners in Montrose moved it back from its traditional slot at the end of November to avoid a possible clash with general election coverage. And all those Fine Gael posters and billboards appearing like a rash on gable walls and bus shelters throughout the land. Like the billboard promising “A new energy for Kildare South” with candidates Joe Neville, Evie Sammon and Bernard Durkan alongside high-wattage Simon Harris beaming down on the masses. FG’s runners in Kildare South must have been shocked to see it. The aforementioned candidates are actually standing in Kildare North. The sense of indecent haste continues with Cllr John Paul O’Shea, the party’s candidate in Cork North West, ending up on the side of a bus shelter in Listowel, birthplace of Billy O’Shea, Fine Gael’s actual candidate in Kerry. And hats off to Minister for Higher Education Patrick O’Donovan, spectacularly ignoring his Government’s line that the election will be next year with huge billboards in Limerick. Featuring one huge photo of Patrick’s smiley phizog, it bears a simple message, writ large: “Patrick O’Donovan TD. Your Cabinet Minister for Limerick.” Nah. It’ll be in February. With TDs and senators all of a dither this week over claims that one of their own is a Russian secret agent, we were surprised not to hear the stentorian tones of former soldier Senator Gerard Craughwell holding forth on this critical issue of national security. Members of the Upper House have seemed far more exercised on this matter than their Dáil counterparts. Rear-Admiral Craughwell, who recently put the wind up Putin by threatening to send out a flotilla of finger-wagging Irish parliamentarians to monitor Russian naval manoeuvres in Irish waters, takes a keen interest in defence matters and his observations on the unfolding espionage crisis were much anticipated. Gerard, however, has been deeply involved in manoeuvres of a different kind. He is busy ensuring his re-election to the Seanad. A member of the Seanad’s independent group of senators, he was first elected in 2014, unexpectedly winning a by-election on the Cultural and Education panel after Fine Gael’s shoo-in candidate became embroiled in a row over government stroke politics and withdrew from the race. Despite it being incredibly tough for an independent to win in a contest where elected local politicians control the vote, he has managed to keep his seat by keeping the councillors sweet. This year, he splashed out on over 940 lapel badges and posted one to every councillor in the country. The pins, produced by Abbey Badges in Blackrock, are attractive items and have been “well received” says Senator Craughwell. “You will note the pins are unique with the name of the council on top, the council coat of arms and ‘elected June 2024′ at the bottom,” he tells us. “They are a mark of recognition and a collector’s item.” Each pin comes with a card from Gerard congratulating them on their success. “Wear it with pride for all that you have accomplished. Keep up the good work!” He also encloses full details of his particulars in case anyone wants to take them down. The race for the next Seanad may not have officially started, but it’s already in full swing. “Be sure I will run!” parps the bullish Craughwell. Of the many tributes paid to Mary O’Rourke since her death just over a week ago, one of the more interesting ones came from Ivan Yates, who was Fine Gael spokesman on public enterprise when Mary ran the department. Speaking on his weekly podcast with Matt Cooper, Ivan was full of praise for the political acumen of his erstwhile sparring partner – but he didn’t rate her at all as a minister. He was very firmly on the side of Brian Joyce, the former chairman of CIÉ who resigned on her ministerial watch citing “interference”, among other things. After the bombshell broke, Mary was shocked, breathlessly telling Morning Ireland how she heard the news. Ivan spoke vaguely of the way “this pressure came up”, which led to Mary revealing to the nation that she was “in the bath listening to the totally unannounced, unexpected resignation of Mr Joyce”. He regaled himself with details of his heroic part in this affair – how he played a blinder on the same programme a short time later, noting that after she went on about her bath “she proceeded to completely drop the towel and put the knife into Mr Joyce in a quite outrageous way”. Then they clashed on Prime Time, where she continued “savaging” Joyce while “letting on she didn’t know anything about it [the resignation] but she absolutely garrotted him”. Mary O’Rourke may not be around now to contradict him, but Richard Moore, her media adviser at the time, offers a more detailed timeline of what happened all those ago. It’s a tale full of drama and intrigue and he has never spoken about it before. That memorable bath and resignation episode happened on a Tuesday morning in the year 2000. On the previous day, Monday, March 6th, Mary was due to appear on RTÉ's Questions and Answers. There would, doubtless, be a question on the ongoing rows between her and her CIÉ chairman over how the organisation and, in particular, the rail system was funded and run. Joyce was appointed by Fine Gael in 1995 and had been due to retire in November 2000. Relations between them were always poor and Mary had been demanding a meeting with CIÉ’s chief executive later that week to discuss the company’s performance. Sadly, in a heartbreaking turn of events, the programme was cancelled due to the unexpected death of the presenter’s son. On Tuesday morning, The Irish Times splashed with a front page exclusive by Arthur Beesley. The story, with its leaked details, was filed on Monday night. Brian Joyce had resigned because of Mary O’Rourke’s “interference”. This came as a bolt from the blue to the Department. The usual practice if the chair of a semi-state was going to resign (or write a stern rebuke) was to call the Minister’s office first to let them know to expect a very important letter. That never happened in this case, recalls Richard Moore. Instead, Joyce’s resignation letter was hand-delivered to the minister’s office in Kildare Street after 8pm on Monday evening when she would have been in RTÉ, had circumstances not intervened. It was accepted by the security/service officer on duty and the unknown individual who delivered it said nothing about alerting the Minister or the Department to its importance. It was eventually opened on Tuesday, well after its contents had been revealed by The Irish Times. And well after RTÉ led its 7am radio bulletin with a report based on Beesley’s scoop. When she heard it, a stunned Mary immediately rang her media adviser. He headed straight into the office, getting in at 7.30am to find her already at her desk. She spoke to Morning Ireland after the 8am bulletin, famously declaring where she was when she heard the shock news. Afterwards, some commentators described the sharing of this detail as a masterstroke. All anyone could remember was that she was in the bath when somebody resigned and the story quickly faded. But back to RTÉ, where the plot thickens. Had Q&A not been cancelled at the last minute, Mary would have been on the panel with Fine Gael’s Jim Mitchell. A view quickly formed in Fianna Fáil circles – one shared by Moore – that the Minister escaped an ambush that night. Inevitably, she would have been asked about her troubled relationship with CIÉ and answered it with her usual confidence, only for someone – possibly the late Mr Mitchell – to remark if she was such a great minister, how come her chairman had resigned? Cue bafflement, consternation ... carnage. There is a delicious final twist. Much later on that fateful Tuesday, the then minister of state Mary Hanafin contacted O’Rourke about a strange voice message someone had left on her mobile phone. Richard Moore says it went something like: “Hello Ivan, I think matters have worked out well; let me know what else I can do.” In those days, TDs were allocated phones with sequenced numbers. There was (and still is) a one-digit difference between the phone numbers of Ivan Yates and Mary Hanafin. Back then, she was used to people leaving messages placing bets on horses. Yates was a bookie as well as an ambitious politician. O’Rourke believed she had her “gotcha!” moment. Her team downloaded Hanafin’s recording on to cassette tapes with a view to releasing it to the media at a snap press conference. It would have been sensational, particularly as the man who thought he was ringing Ivan Yates (and who did not get on with O’Rourke) gave his first name. But in the end they decided against it. Moore, who went on to set up a successful communications consultancy, felt this would complicate the unfolding resignation commentary – which was going well for his minister, while it might be best not to remind people of Fianna Fáil’s past history with recording phone calls. It took a lot of persuading, but Mary agreed to say nothing. A hard ask for the woman concerned, but she kept her part of the bargain. Our politics team’s behind-the-scenes take on events of the day.

Title: We have a problem with squirrels in our garden. What can we do to keep them at bay?

Q: We have a problem with grey squirrels in our city garden. They are digging in the beds and causing damage to some of the plants. Any tips on how to keep them at bay? RL, Blackrock, Dublin A: As charming as their arboreal acrobatics might be to watch, grey squirrels can be a real problem in Irish gardens, stripping bark from broad-leaf trees, raiding birds’ nests, burrowing into lawns and digging up flower bulbs. They also feed on seeds, nuts, fruits, tender shoots and flower buds and act as a vector for diseases such as squirrel pox virus which can kill the smaller native red squirrel in a matter of weeks. They are also known to sometimes overwinter in the attics of houses where they can cause considerable damage by chewing through wires and pipework and ripping up insulation as well as contaminating water tanks. Classed as an invasive species, they were first introduced into Ireland in 1911. Thankfully the spread of their natural predator the pine marten in recent years has acted as a curb on numbers. But in urban areas where the pine marten hasn’t gained much of a foothold, grey squirrels are still common. How to best manage them? I know of one Dublin gardener who tried trapping them in a baited cage before releasing them into the wild. But this is not recommended, not least because they breed so prolifically that it would barely put a dent in their numbers but also because it could potentially threaten red squirrel populations. Bird feeders are an obvious draw, so make sure to use squirrel-proof models that prevent them from easily raiding them for food. Recently planted flower bulbs are another, for which reason seasoned gardeners often like to plant theirs under a protective layer of fine mesh chicken wire concealed beneath the surface of the soil of compost. Alternatively, they can be planted into an aquatic basket (the kind used for pond plants) covered with a layer of chicken wire and then planted into the ground. It’s also a good idea to regularly check your home for any small gaps in the eaves and/or soffit boards that could allow them entry, especially at this time of year when they are searching for a sheltered place in which to overwinter. These should be blocked up with a fine-gauge wire mesh (16 gauge, no more than 25mm size). But even with these measures, I’m afraid that they are likely to continue to be a problem.

Title: Mizuho Raises Equinix, Inc. (EQIX) Price Target to $971, Maintains Outperform Rating Amid Positive Outlook for Cab Billing Growth and xScale Demand

We recently compiled a list of the 35 Trending AI Stocks on Latest News and Analyst Ratings. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Equinix, Inc. (NASDAQ:EQIX) stands against the other trending AI stocks. Two years after the public debut of ChatGPT, the generative AI landscape has evolved rapidly, igniting substantial investments in artificial intelligence and lifting valuations for startups and major tech companies alike. This surge in interest has primarily centered on cloud-based AI, where services like OpenAI's models operate on extensive data infrastructures. However, as these models grow in complexity, the demand for larger and more advanced data centers intensifies, leading to a race among companies to construct expansive facilities. Significant investments are projected, with estimates suggesting that major players will collectively spend around $160 billion in capital expenditures next year, primarily for acquiring powerful GPUs and related infrastructure necessary for training AI models. Top executives have even forecasted that global data center investments could double to $2 trillion within the next few years. Nevertheless, the sustainability of this spending spree raises questions about whether the revenue generated from AI applications can match the high costs of development and infrastructure. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. Amid these challenges, a new trend in edge AI is emerging. This concept involves running AI algorithms directly on personal devices like smartphones and computers rather than relying on centralized cloud servers. Edge AI offers numerous benefits, including real-time response capabilities without requiring a high-speed internet connection and enhanced privacy since user data remains on personal devices. Analysts project that nearly 50% of smartphones will have generative AI capabilities by 2027, a significant increase from the current 4%. However, implementing edge AI presents technical hurdles, primarily due to existing devices lacking the necessary computing power and memory to support large AI models. For instance, running OpenAI's GPT-4 model, which contains approximately 1.8 trillion parameters, is not feasible on typical smartphones today. Nevertheless, smaller, task-specific AI models are gaining traction, as they require less training data and can outperform larger, more generalized models in certain applications. These lightweight models are often open-source and designed for specific functions, making them easier to implement on consumer devices. As semiconductor companies continue to innovate by increasing processing power and memory in smartphones and PCs, the capacity for running AI models on these devices is expected to grow. Research indicates that the proportion of smartphones capable of supporting large AI models could rise significantly within the next few years. Major chip manufacturers are advancing technologies such as chipset designs, allowing them to create more powerful processors without needing to shrink the circuitry. For investors, the rise of edge AI could lead to new opportunities and growth within the consumer electronics market, as users are likely to upgrade their devices to take advantage of enhanced AI functionalities. UBS analysts project that combined sales of smartphones and PCs could exceed $700 billion by 2027. Ultimately, the success of edge AI hinges on the development of compelling applications that consumers find valuable enough to invest in.

A team of IT professionals working on a digital platform, indicating the company's agile digital services. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 56 Equinix, Inc. (NASDAQ:EQIX) is a California-based real estate trust that operates data centers and other technology assets. Mizuho recently raised the price target on the stock to $971 from $873 and kept an Outperform rating on the shares after speaking with management. The company's cab's billing growth will improve in the second half of 2024 and when combined with strong pricing power, there is upside to monthly recurring revenue, the advisory told investors in a research note. The investment firm sees multiple levers of earnings and sales growth for Equinix. While still a small part of the business, the company suggested a very robust demand pipeline for its xScale portfolio, added Mizuho. Overall EQIX ranks 16th among the AI stocks that are trending right now. While we acknowledge the potential of EQIX as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than EQIX but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We recently compiled a list of the 35 Trending AI Stocks on Latest News and Analyst Ratings. In this article, we are going to take a look at where AeroVironment, Inc. (NASDAQ:AVAV) stands against the other trending AI stocks. Two years after the public debut of ChatGPT, the generative AI landscape has evolved rapidly, igniting substantial investments in artificial intelligence and lifting valuations for startups and major tech companies alike. This surge in interest has primarily centered on cloud-based AI, where services like OpenAI's models operate on extensive data infrastructures. However, as these models grow in complexity, the demand for larger and more advanced data centers intensifies, leading to a race among companies to construct expansive facilities. Significant investments are projected, with estimates suggesting that major players will collectively spend around $160 billion in capital expenditures next year, primarily for acquiring powerful GPUs and related infrastructure necessary for training AI models. Top executives have even forecasted that global data center investments could double to $2 trillion within the next few years. Nevertheless, the sustainability of this spending spree raises questions about whether the revenue generated from AI applications can match the high costs of development and infrastructure. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. Amid these challenges, a new trend in edge AI is emerging. This concept involves running AI algorithms directly on personal devices like smartphones and computers rather than relying on centralized cloud servers. Edge AI offers numerous benefits, including real-time response capabilities without requiring a high-speed internet connection and enhanced privacy since user data remains on personal devices. Analysts project that nearly 50% of smartphones will have generative AI capabilities by 2027, a significant increase from the current 4%. However, implementing edge AI presents technical hurdles, primarily due to existing devices lacking the necessary computing power and memory to support large AI models. For instance, running OpenAI's GPT-4 model, which contains approximately 1.8 trillion parameters, is not feasible on typical smartphones today. Nevertheless, smaller, task-specific AI models are gaining traction, as they require less training data and can outperform larger, more generalized models in certain applications. These lightweight models are often open-source and designed for specific functions, making them easier to implement on consumer devices. As semiconductor companies continue to innovate by increasing processing power and memory in smartphones and PCs, the capacity for running AI models on these devices is expected to grow. Research indicates that the proportion of smartphones capable of supporting large AI models could rise significantly within the next few years. Major chip manufacturers are advancing technologies such as chipset designs, allowing them to create more powerful processors without needing to shrink the circuitry. For investors, the rise of edge AI could lead to new opportunities and growth within the consumer electronics market, as users are likely to upgrade their devices to take advantage of enhanced AI functionalities. UBS analysts project that combined sales of smartphones and PCs could exceed $700 billion by 2027. Ultimately, the success of edge AI hinges on the development of compelling applications that consumers find valuable enough to invest in.

The firm focuses on integrating artificial intelligence into its unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) and robotic solutions. It uses AI to enhance the autonomy, decision-making capabilities, and data processing of its drones, which are used in defense, surveillance, and precision agriculture. Jefferies analyst Greg Konrad has a Buy rating on the stock with a price target of $230. In a recent investor note, Konrad noted that a 8-K disclosure by the firm that the US Army has lifted the stop work order on a $990 million contract pointed to the importance of loitering munitions and the immediacy of demand.

Gardaí are among the key workers facing soaring rents in Dublin. Photo: Getty John Coleman, CEO of the Land Development Agency will appear before the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) next week to confirm the building of 17,000 new homes in the coming years. These homes will be rented at €1,000 below market rent. Wonderful and welcome news, as we all have a responsibility to look after the least well-off. Unfortunately, there was not one word about how our key workers can no longer afford to live in Dublin. Dublin is one of the few developed capital cities in the world that does not pay “weighting allowances” to retain key workers. We are educating them in the thousands to emigrate. No city can function properly without key workers, and if this problem is not addressed then Dublin and Ireland will suffer both socially and economically in the future. Many will argue that the rot has already set in and point to the scarcity of gardaí, teachers and nurses. Will any member of the PAC have the courage to ask Mr Coleman if the billions being spent on housing by the Government do anything to solve the rental crisis for key workers in Dublin? We need key workers more than they need us. Paschal Taggart, Rathgar, Dublin 6 One notes that Trinity College Dublin has renamed the Berkeley Library after the Irish poet Eavan Boland. This has come about after years of campaigning from students and staff as a way of celebrating those who use these buildings. It’s important to remember that George Berkeley – Anglo-Irish philosopher, bishop and cannabis user – was a slave owner as well as being a vocal proponent of this egregious trade. I found it incredulous that Ireland’s most celebrated philosopher was extremely flawed and fallible. Trinity College never had any buildings named after women until now. This indicates to me a college that is modernising itself in meeting with the challenges of today. It would be true to say progress is slow, but the arc of history always bends towards justice. I am delighted this renaming has occurred, as it is important that we always acknowledge the students who use these buildings. What the renaming brings up for me is that there is no tradition too sacred to question. John O’Brien, Clonmel, Co Tipperary This week has underscored the devastating impact of our current economic model on nature. The World Wildlife Fund’s Living Planet Report reveals a calamitous decline in wildlife populations since 1970, with ecosystems like the Amazon and coral reefs nearing collapse (‘Tipping point near as wildlife populations down 73pc in 50 years’, Irish Independent, October 10). These ecosystems are vital for our climate, but also our food and health. At the same time, the report warned of potential “social collapse” from climate change, with regions becoming uninhabitable and millions at risk. Yet there is hope. Both reports stress that reversing this damage is still possible with radical, urgent changes in our economics, politics, behaviour and assumptions. Change starts with each of us. By acting locally, uniting with others and demanding accountability from the powerful, we can spark the wider transformation needed to protect the planet. Hans Zomer, Global Action Plan As a tillage farmer reaching Irish climate change targetsyears earlier than the target set by our Government, I do have to ask how is that we have to use Irish cream from Irish cows to make Irish cream liquors, yet there is no mention where the grain has to come from to make our world-famous Irish whiskeys? The technical file covering both liquors and whiskey was drafted by our Department of Agriculture and I have to ask why is the imbalance in the two agricultural sectors – tillage and dairy – in favour of dairy? Why not protect the tillage sector in an equal fashion? In a world of climate change, where I believe I produce a near net-zero carbon footprint product, where is the support from the Government for me and my fellow tillage farmers? The Irish tillage sector has by far the lowest greenhouse gas emissions compared to other agricultural sectors, according to state body Teagasc. Bobby Miller, Stradbally, Co Laois I must disagree with Larry Dunne that “banning mobile phones in schools is just another excuse for teachers to assert control” (Letters, Irish Independent, October 10). Teachers do need to have control in their classrooms and I don’t believe any excuses are needed. A smartphone is not just a phone, it is also a camera, a calculator and a computer. Schools are well equipped with calculators and computers, so there is no need for smartphones in classrooms. A camera is not necessary in classrooms, either, and in my opinion smartphones should not be allowed in schools at all, as they can be used as tools of intimidation and bullying of both students and teachers. Most of all, phones are a distraction to students who can hear message alerts if they have them in their schoolbags. Marion Dermody, Co Kildare Ciara Kelly’s excellent comment article (‘Acts of abuse by trusted educators have devastating impacts reaching far beyond the boys who were the actual victims of these vile men’, Irish Independent, October 7) brought back some very unpleasant buried memories of my eight years boarding in Willow Park and Blackrock College in the 1960s. One such memory was the priest who chased us around the fields of Willow Park trying to hit us on the bum with his biffer – a short, thick leather strap. I actually remember running so hard as I knew being hit by this vile object was extremely painful. ​ Brian Mc Devitt, Glenties, Co Donegal Join the Irish Independent WhatsApp channel Stay up to date with all the latest news

The world’s largest asset manager BlackRock has seen its asset under management (AUM) surge by a whopping $160 billion during the third quarter of the year, to now have a record-breaking $11.5 trillion in AUM. According to a recent Bloomberg report, investors were particularly drawn to BlackRock’s exchange-traded fund (ETF) offerings – which include a spot Bitcoin ETF, the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) – investing $97 billion in these funds. Additionally, fixed-income investments saw a significant influx of $63 billion, leading the company’s year-to-date inflows to $360 billion, a figure that surpasses its total net flows seen in both 2022 and 2023. BlackRock has garnered an impressive $360 billion in net inflows year-to-date, surpassing its total net flows for both 2022 and 2023. BlackRock has further solidified its position as a one-stop shop for investments by completing the acquisition of Global Infrastructure Partners for $12.5 billion. The deal added $116 billion in private market assets to BlackRock’s portfolio, which has also seen strong demand for cash management and money-market funds, attracting $61 billion in net flows during the quarter. The firm’s growth has been fueled by a favorable market environment, with a surge in stocks and increasing investor interest in fixed-income and private funds. The S&P 500 Index’s ‘unstoppable’ rise so far this year and expectations for a less aggressive Federal Reserve rate hike have contributed to this positive trend. BlackRock’s financial performance saw its adjusted net income per share rise 5% to $11.46 and revenue 15% to $5.2 billion. Its market-leading spot Bitcoin ETF, according to CoinGlass data, currently has around $17.2 billion of assets under management, far above its closest competitors, Grayscale’s GBTC and Fidelity’s FBTC, which have $13.1 billion and $9.9 billion in AUM, respectively.

Financial powerhouses including JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and BlackRock reported strong earnings on Friday, sending shares soaring and Wall Street into new record territory. U.S.: Tesla keeps Nasdaq in check while Dow and S&P set recordsThe S&P 500 set another new record, its second this week, climbing 0.61% Friday on positive earnings and producer price index data. Same goes for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which climbed 0.97% to close at another all-time high. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq had to contend with Tesla shares tumbling after the launch of the Cybercab. Europe: U.S. data has ripple effect, sending stocks upEuropean stocks hovered early Friday but closed up, with the UK’s FTSE 100 climbing 0.19% and the STOXX Europe 600 at 0.55% on positive earnings reports from big banks on Wall Street. The markets had a lot to digest Friday, including a stimulus briefing planned in Beijing and France’s new draft budget. China: Shares slip ahead of stimulus briefingA day after China shares rebounded on stimulus optimism, Shanghai’s SSE Composite slid 2.5%. Markets are cautious ahead of Beijing’s Saturday briefing, at which investors are hoping for more measures to boost the economy. Hong Kong markets were closed for a public holiday. Japan: Nikkei posts small rise on the back of banks and Uniqlo The Nikkei 225 notched a 0.57% rise as it headed into the weekend, led by the financial sector and a 6.09% jump in Uniqlo-owner Fast Retailing, which hit an all-time high after reporting stronger-than-expected revenue and profits for the year. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Banks Compensate for Drop by Tesla as More Records Fall

US stocks rose to records Friday as big banks rallied following a run of reassuring profit reports. The Dow rose 409.74 points, or 1%, to 42,863.86, a record. The S&P 500 rose 34.98 points, or 0.6%, to 5,815.03, topping its all-time high set earlier in the week. The Nasdaq rose 60.89 points, or 0.3%, to 18,342.94, held down by Tesla's slide. Wells Fargo rose 5.6% after reporting stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected, the AP reports. It benefited from better results from its venture-capital investments and higher fees for investment-banking services, among other factors. Banks and other financial giants traditionally kick off each earnings reporting season, and JPMorgan Chase climbed 4.4% after reporting a milder drop in profit than analysts feared. That was the strongest single force pushing upward on the S&P 500. CEO Jamie Dimon said the nation's largest bank is also still buying back shares of its stock to send cash to investors, though the pace is modest "given that market levels are at least slightly inflated." BlackRock rose 3.6% after likewise delivering better profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. The investment giant ended September managing a record $11.5 trillion in total assets for its customers. The gains for banks helped make up for the drag of Tesla, which tumbled 8.8% and was the heaviest weight on the market. The electric-vehicle maker unveiled its long-awaited robotaxi on Thursday night, but critics highlighted a lack of details about its planned rollout. Following the unveiling of the "Cybercab," potential rival Uber Technologies jumped 10.8% and was one of the strongest forces lifting the S&P 500. Lyft rose 9.6%. (More Wall Street stories.)

U.Today - American multinational investment giant BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) has extended its lead as the world’s dominant asset manager with an $11.5 trillion Asset Under Management (AUM) milestone. As revealed in its third-quarter earnings report, the company said its AUM jumped $2.4 trillion year-over-year, driven by net inflows of $456 billion and positive market movements. This product marked a complete pivot for BlackRock, a traditionally conservative firm. In line with its adoption of Bitcoin, CEO Larry Fink is now one of the major advocates of the digital currency. With the AUM boost, it remains unclear what the firm plans for its iShares Bitcoin Trust product overall. While the Bitcoin ETF is BlackRock's flagship and most popular crypto product, BlackRock is also fully invested in iShares Ethereum Trust, the ETH ETF. Despite the generally poorer performance of Ethereum ETF products, BlackRock remains in the lead among issuers overall. With the massive uptick in BlackRock AUM, it may be inferred that Bitcoin and Ethereum contributed significantly to this new milestone. As a regulated investment outfit, BlackRock is combining a conservative approach with new tech adoption. As such, its current capital base might encourage it to take more calculated risks in the coin moving forward. Despite BlackRock's stance, not all rivals share its vision for Bitcoin. Firms like Vanguard have specifically issued a highly publicized disclaimer that it will not get involved with Bitcoin, or crypto in general. This article was originally published on U.Today

Shares of BlackRock (BLK) hit an all-time high Friday after the investment firm easily topped financial estimates and posted records for assets and inflows. The company reported third-quarter adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $11.46, with revenue increasing 14.9% year-over-year to $5.20 billion. Analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha were looking for $10.38 and $5.02 billion, respectively. BlackRock's assets under management (AUM) rose $2.4 trillion to $11.5 trillion, and net inflows came in at $221 billion, both all-time highs. The company explained that the big jump in revenue came from "the positive impact of markets on average AUM, organic base fee growth, and higher performance fees." Chief Executive Officer CEO Larry Fink said, "Our strategy is ambitious, and our strategy is working." He noted that the firm was driving "access to the enormous investment potential of infrastructure, especially to support AI innovation." Fink added that "the opportunities ahead of us have never been greater." BlackRock shares recently rose 3% to $983.28 after earlier touching a record $995.99. They are up more than 20% year-to-date.

Title: Child going abroad for scoliosis surgery can travel business class with one parent, says CHI

Children with scoliosis who are going abroad for treatment under a new scheme can travel business class on a plane with one parent, while the other will be booked in economy, it emerged today. The travel package for children was detailed as it emerged up to 38 children have had their spinal surgery outsourced from Dublin children’s hospital to another hospital, including hospitals in the UK and the United States, according to September waiting list figures. The travel package states for comfort and flexibility, families will be booked into either a three-star hotel or a serviced apartment, close to the hospital abroad. Families will be provided with these details directly before their travel date, it added. Families will be provided with a daily stipend for meals and expenses while they are away. Before the trip, parents will receive a prepaid currency card. More information about this will be discussed directly with families when their surgery date is confirmed, said CHI. It will include travel insurance, an issue which some parents were worried about. Under an initiative to reduce waiting list for children with scoliosis needing spinal surgery it was announced during the summer that suitable patients could have their surgeries in other designated hospitals. Overall, the waiting list or spinal surgery in September stood at 248 compared to 258 the month previously. The children whose care are outsourced come under the suspended list. Children’s Health Ireland (CHI), which oversees the three children's hospitals, announced during the summer that it was engaging with other hospitals and organisations, both in Ireland and abroad, regarding spinal surgeries and patient care agreements. At that stage a number of patients had been assessed and deemed suitable for spinal surgery abroad. The hospitals include New York-Presbyterian Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital, Great Ormond Street Children’s Hospital and the Portland Hospital in London There is an ongoing agreement with Blackrock Clinic in Dublin to continue to work together to expand out-sourcing for adolescents who require spinal fusion surgery. For the first time CHI has published dedicated phone numbers and the names of staff who will take calls from parents on clinical questions.There are also personal emails for questions around surgery abroad and an email for a spinal patient advocate liaison coordinator. Advocacy groups representing parents of children on the waiting list have remained critical of the service and poor communication with reports of parents trying to get an update on their child and failing to get information. Waiting list figures show that nationally 87,022 patients were waiting for an appointment for their inpatient or day case treatment in September. While 23,883 patients were waiting to receive an appointment for their gastrointestinal endoscopy and 595,575 patients are waiting for a first hospital outpatient consultation. The Department of Health said today the hospital waiting list for hospitals across the country demonstrate the progress achieved through the multi-annual action plan approach implemented by the Government to address long wait times for care. The latest hospital activity report, published by the Health Service Executive (HSE), shows increased levels of activity in the delivery of scheduled and unscheduled care. The figures show significant positive progress being achieved in terms of patients waiting longest. There has been a .17pc reduction in the total number of patients waiting over 12 months since this time last year, and a corresponding reduction of .27pc in the number waiting over 18 months.

Title: Inside Track On The Wall Street Embrace Of Bitcoin And Digital Assets
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2024/10/11/inside-track-on-the-wall-street-embrace-of-bitcoin-and-digital-assets/

BUDAPEST, HUNGARY - SEPTEMBER 22: A statue of Satoshi Nakamoto, a presumed pseudonym used by the ... [+] inventor of Bitcoin, is displayed in Graphisoft Park on September 22, 2021 in Budapest, Hungary. The statue's creators, Reka Gergely and Tamas Gilly, used anonymized facial features, as Nakamoto's true identify remains unconfirmed. (Photo by Janos Kummer/Getty Images) There should no longer be a question in anyone’s mind that bitcoin is here to stay. What may be a little less clear is, why? The answer is fairly simple: Wall Street found the money. The last sentence should be amusing to those who are supporters of bitcoin or are immersed in the digital asset class. Bitcoin Bitcoin , after all, was created to be money. On October 31, 2008, the mysterious unknown developer of bitcoin who goes under the what is widely believed to be a pseudonymous name, Satoshi Nakamoto, described a digital cryptocurrency in a white paper titled, “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System.” It is entirely plausible that the leaders of global financial institutions read the white paper, studied the behavior of bitcoin throughout the fifteen plus years of existence, and converted to the belief system that bitcoin is going to have a fundamental impact on the global financial system. There is no reason to believe this did not happen. Chairman and CEO of BlackRock Larry Fink (Photo by Mat Szwajkos/Getty Images) This is, in fact, fairly close to what Larry Fink, the chief executive of Blackrock, believed to be the world’s largest asset manager, said during an interview with Jim Cramer on CNBC. Larry Fink said, “I was a proud skeptic. I studied it. Learned about it, and I came away saying okay, my opinion five years ago was wrong, here is my opinion today, I believe the opportunity today. I believe bitcoin is legitimate…it is a legitimate financial instrument that allows you to have uncorrelated, non-correlated type of returns.” There is an alternative explanation, however, that is equally plausible: the global financial institutions simply listened to their customers. In the month of October 2024, bitcoin has a market cap of over $1.2 trillion. There may be reasons to be skeptical of bitcoin, and far more reasons when considering the broader cryptocurrency universe, but it is impossible to deny that an asset with a value of over one trillion dollars is not real or meaningful. Young traders are taught that markets have momentum, and that momentum and market sentiment can be more important than fundamentals. Experienced financial market participants know that the markets can be like trains, and one should never stand in the way of a freight train under the misguided belief that you know exactly where it is going to stop. Bitcoin is a train in motion. Skeptics should be careful. Customers across the entire spectrum, from retail to institutional, have expressed interest in bitcoin. More importantly, these customers have asked financial service institutions to provide access to bitcoin in a manner consistent with other established financial assets. LevelField Financial, my firm, is in the process of acquiring a U.S. chartered bank because we heard those customers, and we wish to provide a safe, simple, and secure experience for customers who wish to participate in the digital asset class. Financial institutions – particularly the large Wall Street firms – exist to serve customers. If they do not offer the products and services requested by their customers, then it is entirely probable that those customers will migrate to other firms that offer the desired products. For financial institutions, meeting the needs of customers is how they generate revenue. All products and services sold to customers generate value for the firm, one way or another. Put another way, financial institutions make money by selling products to customers that the customers want to buy. Customers have said they wanted access to bitcoin products. For institutions they face a choice: not delivering such products could potentially risk the customer relationship, while providing the customers the products they want will generate revenue for the firm. It may be the case that the titans of Wall Street are converts to the future of cryptocurrency based upon extensive study and a belief that this asset class represents a considerable improvement over the status quo. Alternatively, a simple explanation for why so many firms are supporting bitcoin may be that they are simply reacting to overwhelming demand from their customers. After all, strong demand for products can lead to lucrative profits. Occam’s razor suggests that the simplest explanation is usually the correct one. Financial institutions responding to their customers and making money while doing so is how markets are supposed to work. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

Title: Why are we seeing the Northern Lights more frequently in Ireland?
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/environment/2024/10/11/why-are-we-seeing-the-northern-lights-more-frequently-in-ireland/
Time Published: 2024-10-11T17:11:32Z
Full Content:
The Northern Lights, also known as aurora borealis, are the results of collisions between gas particles in our atmosphere and charged particles ejected from the sun’s atmosphere. The colour of the Northern Lights change due to the type of gas particles that are colliding. Oxygen molecules at approximately 100km above the earth produce a greenish-yellow colour, while a red aurora can be seen when high-level oxygen molecules are involved. Blue or purple auroras indicate the presence of nitrogen molecules. Frances McCarthy, education officer at MTU’s Blackrock Castle Observatory in Cork, said it was predicted based on images of the sun that showed a “coronal mass ejection”, where a large amount of the outer part of the sun’s atmosphere was ejected into space. “When the charged material from the sun arrived yesterday, it affected the upper atmosphere near the poles and made the glow of the aurora,” she said. “We saw red light in Cork, due to oxygen at the upper levels glowing. Red aurora are rare. The green light was from lower level atmospheric gases, and are more common. Prior to this, I had only ever seen green aurora.” The UK’s Met Office had also reported that sightings of the Northern Lights were likely on Thursday night and the early hours of Friday across northern areas of the UK. Solar activity changes in an 11-year cycle and we are currently near the top of the cycle of most activity, so eruptions such as coronal mass ejections and sunspots are more common. Ms McCarthy added that the sun was “last this active in 1989” while aurora are more common near the north and south magnetic poles so only very strong space weather events will affect us or be visible to us as aurora. The Northern Lights are best observed in locations with very small amounts of light pollution and clear skies in terms of ideal weather conditions. Parts of the west and north coast offer the greatest chance of seeing the display, according to Met Éireann. It points out there are a number of forecast services for the Northern Lights; including one which comes from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) that provides a 30-minute forecast for the aurora. People can also check out spaceweather.com. Unfortunately no, we are not likely to see the Northern Lights again on Friday night as the geomagnetic storm is subsiding. Ms McCarthy added there would be chances again in the future to see the Northern Lights but probably not this weekend. Sarah Burns is a reporter for The Irish Times © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Catch up on the latest World of Warcraft news with This Week in WoW (TWiW)! Join the celebration as World of Warcraft celebrates its 20th Anniversary with new activities and myriad ways to earn currency. When: October 22, 2024 – January 6, 2025 Where: Outside the Caverns of Time in Tanaris Here’s what you can look forward to during the 20th Anniversary Celebration: Players level 10 and up will receive the quest, “Another Timely Invitation,” inviting them to the celebration in Tanaris outside the Caverns of Time. You’ll speak with Yllana to turn in your quest and then pick up some one-time quests to learn more about the event. Grab all the celebration details from our World of Warcraft 20th Anniversary Celebration article. The WoW 20th Anniversary introduces a variety of new activities and ways to earn currency during the event, which can be used to purchase myriad items including iconic Tier 2 transmog appearance sets. We’ve consulted top goblins and tallied it all up so that you know how to earn these currencies and where you can spend them. Players will also automatically be granted a 10% experience and reputation buff during the Anniversary and can add an additional 10% experience and reputation buff by completing the repeatable “Celebrate Good Fun” quest with Yllana. This buff will not countdown while offline and will be offered to you again once per day when it expires. Developer Insights: For the Anniversary event, we want these epic new rewards to feel both special to players and well-earned. To that end, we have worked to create a rewarding system that should help players earn their first Tier 2 set in the first 2-3 weeks, depending upon their play style. We know that there are a lot of people who are excited to earn more sets if not all of them. To accommodate this, we have both discounts and increased abilities to earn currency that kick in after those early weeks (detailed further below). This should allow players who play through the event regularly to have the ability to earn all thirteen of these Tier Sets and many, if not all of the other new cosmetic rewards tied to the anniversary. If you run out of time this year, don’t worry; we will have the sets available from the anniversary event in future years. Learn all the details about currency types, anniversary vendors, Tier 2 armor appearances, and more from our previously published article. Calling defenders of Azeroth to brave the inferno and push back against Ragnaros and his wayward loyalists—the Rage of the Firelands update arrives on October 29, followed by the Firelands Raid on November 7. The Rage of the Firelands content update will burn an indelible mark in Azeroth's history. Take on the new Elemental Bonds questline, and increase the challenges for powerful rewards with the new Elemental Rune Dungeons: Protocol Inferno difficulty option. Then, soon after the update, the legendary Firelands Raid arrives with its Raid tier armor and weapons, two new mounts, Achievements, and seven unique boss encounters. This will also be the stop for Druid, Mage, Priest, Shaman, or Warlock in their quest to build the legendary staff Dragonwrath, Tarecgosa's Rest, a weapon of unsurpassed quality that requires a spectacular effort to construct. Like the Shadowmourne questline in Wrath of the Lich King Classic, adjustments have been made to make Dragonwrath, Tarecgosa's Rest, faster to acquire on both 10 and 25-player raid sizes. More details await you in our previously published article. The time to strike at Ragnaros the Firelord draws near. For all champions daring to begin a new adventure or continue their odyssey in Azeroth, you can prepare for the heat when you take advantage of the Joyous Journeys experience buff*, which increases experience gains by 50% for all players up to level 85! Finish leveling a character, create a new one, or invite friends to join you in Cataclysm Classic. The buff is active by default, but you can visit any innkeeper in the capital cities and Dalaran to turn it off or on again. Take advantage of the Joyous Journey’s experience buff now. It’s an excellent opportunity for new and returning players to level up and join the defenders of Hyjal as they fight to create a foothold in the Firelands at the Molten Front before the Ragnaros makes his grand entrance in the Rage of the Firelands content update.

Title: Altice Offers Creditors 15% Stake in Return for Haircut
URL: https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/altice-offers-creditors-15-stake-in-return-for-haircut-11728664364432.html
Time Published: 2024-10-11T16:32:43Z
Full Content:
(Bloomberg) -- Altice France is floating a proposal to give secured creditors a stake in the company to get them to agree to a haircut on their holdings, as the embattled telecommunications giant seeks to whittle away at its €24.4 billion ($26.7 billion) of debt. Under this informal proposal, debtholders would get an equity stake of between 10% and 15% in exchange for writing off the same amount of their principal, according to people familiar with the matter. Other features of the plan include the extension of the maturities by a certain number of years with a lower interest rate than the existing debt, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing private information. The proposal, which was put forward to advisers of its secured creditors, doesn’t envisage new funds from billionaire owner Patrick Drahi, who would remain in charge, the people added. While this was not a formal offer, the company asked the steering committee if the creditors would be willing to sign a non-disclosure agreement to negotiate on this basis, the people said. BlackRock Inc., Elliott Investment Management and Pacific Investment Management Co. are among the investors in the steering committee, Bloomberg reported earlier. Spokespeople for Altice and the secured group of creditors declined to comment. Altice France’s €800 million secured bond due in October 2029 rose about 3.5 cents on the euro to 75.7 cents on Friday, the highest since March, according to pricing compiled by Bloomberg. Meanwhile, Altice France Holding’s €1.3 billion unsecured bond due in May 2027 fell 1.6 cents on the euro to about 30 cents, the biggest drop since April. While the plan in some ways represents a more attractive option for creditors than an earlier offer proposing a 20% haircut, the latest suggestion is still a long way away from the idea put forward by the lenders themselves, under which Drahi would have potentially lost control of the company. The latest proposal would still fall short of achieving a sustainable capital structure, some of the people familiar added. Altice is in talks with its creditors to cut its debt to reach a leverage target of below 4 times its earnings, from 6.7 times. Sentiment in the leveraged finance market is fairly positive on the back of recent interest rate cuts. A lack of supply has also seen investors reach for yield on a technical basis. That means borrowers have been able to get fairly aggressive deals accepted by buysiders, something that could potentially benefit Altice. Investor appetite is certainly stronger than it was when the company first told creditors in March that they would need to take losses. A group of creditors holding about 90% of Altice’s secured debt recently agreed to extend a cooperation agreement that binds them in negotiations on restructuring the company’s balance sheet by a year until February 2026. Separate to the discussions with creditors, the company has also held talks with funds including Apollo Global Management about raising new debt to repay looming maturities, potentially hurting existing creditors down the line, Bloomberg reported earlier. --With assistance from Eleanor Duncan.

Title: BlackRock brought in more money last quarter than ever before. Here's where the $11.5 trillion asset manager hopes to become the industry leader next.
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/blackrocks-next-big-bet-private-markets-2024-10

BlackRock became the world's largest asset manager because it made cheap funds for the masses. Now, the $11.5 trillion behemoth wants to put high-fee private market strategies in your portfolio. The firm brought in more assets last quarter — $221 billion — than ever before, but on its earnings call, the firm's leaders focused more on integrating strategies from the recent acquisition of Global Infrastructure Partners into model portfolios than on its ballooning ETF franchise. "This is a revenue growth story," said BlackRock's chief financial officer Martin Small Friday morning. GIP, the infrastructure asset manager that BlackRock paid $12.5 billion for, is expected to add $250 million in management fees to BlackRock's bottom line in the fourth quarter alone. "This is a meaningful accelerant to our private markets capabilities," he said. A quarter century after BlackRock went public — the firm IPOed on October 1, 1999 — the firm hopes to blend its private market strategies into its model portfolios for wealth managers. Private equity and private credit strategies have the potential to bring on higher returns but are also less liquid and more expensive investments than mutual funds or ETFs. The manager is hoping to be the builder of next-generation technology, whether that's data centers needed for artificial intelligence or infrastructure needed for decarbonization. "We're not going to say they're alternatives because they'll just be part of the market," said BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, about private strategies, which have long been touted in industry lingo as "alternatives" to the public market. Fink said risk will be measured by the liquidity of these blended portfolios. The firm's $3.2 billion acquisition of data giant Preqin will help bring these more complex strategies to a broader audience. The acquisition is set to close at the end of the year. "It's going to happen with the expansion of data and analytics," Fink said. The firm's focus may be shifting because there aren't many more levers to pull for increased growth in its iShares franchise, which crossed $1 trillion in total assets last quarter. The firm's leaders said the fourth quarter is traditionally a strong one for this segment of their business, and the franchise has also seen serious inflows following political events and central bank decisions. Comparatively, retail allocation to the private markets is in the "low-single digits," according to Small, giving BlackRock another territory to expand into. "The opportunities ahead of us have never been better than they are now," Fink said. Private credit, for example, could pick up billions of dollars from the firm's insurance clients, which have $700 billion invested with BlackRock. "We've never shied away from taking big bets," Fink said, and private market strategies are the latest roll of the dice. Jump to

Title: Stock market today: US stocks edge up after wholesale inflation comes in cool

Time Published: 2024-10-11T13:41:50Z
Full Content:
US stocks edged higher on Friday after Producer Price Index data for September came in lower than expected, signaling a continued cooling of wholesale inflation. The producer price index was flat month-over-month, below economist estimates of a 0.1% rise. Meanwhile, Core PPI rose 0.1% in September, compared to an expected rise of 0.2%. TradeStation strategist David Russell told Business Insider the data supports another interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve. "CPI might have seemed hot, but PPI was not. Overall, these numbers are getting less impactful as inflation moderates. The Fed could still be on track for 25 basis points at the next two meetings. Yields have surged lately, but it's not clear they have much more reason for continued upside," Russell said. Investors are also digesting earnings results from JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, and BlackRock. All three stocks moved higher after the results, which beat analyst estimates on most fronts. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon praised his bank's performance in the earnings release, but warned that geopolitical conditions are "treacherous and getting worse." Apart from earnings results, retail sales data, set to be released on October 17, is the next big data release for investors to watch. Bank of America analysts expect September retail sales data to show a 0.8% surge, while consensus estimates expect just 0.2% growth.

The S&P 500 is on track for a muted open and its fifth consecutive winning week despite a slight decline Thursday. The producer price index, a measure of wholesale inflation, came in below expectations for September. A day earlier, consumer inflation data was hotter than expected. With earnings season kicking off, investors should focus more on corporate results than every single economic report. 2. Tesla skeptics are everywhere after the electric vehicle maker's hyped-up robotaxi event was short on details. Shares were down nearly 7%. CEO Elon Musk said Tesla will start building the self-driving taxis, dubbed Cybercab, before 2027 and would cost less than $30,000. But historically he has been too optimistic with these timelines. 3. BlackRock reports a total blowout quarter, with earnings per share of $11.46 well ahead of the $10.33 estimate. Revenues of $5.2 billion also beat. Inflows were insanely strong, representing 8% organic asset growth. The stock is on my shopping list for the CNBC Investing Club. 4. Wells Fargo, one of two financials we currently own for the Club, reported earnings of $1.52 a share on revenues of $20.37 billion. Both were weaker year over year, but EPS was a big beat. Shares added more than 3%. Non-interest income rose 12% on annual basis in the quarter and credit discipline was strong. Also Friday, JPMorgan topped profit and revenue estimates. 5. Domino's offers cheaper pizza, and it is catching on. The "Emergency Pizza" promo is back. Really drawn to the stock down here, even with a number of analysts lowering their price targets after the company's third-quarter earnings report Thursday. Domino's trimmed full-year sales and income growth guidance, citing the economic environment. 6. Advanced Micro Devices' pullback Thursday on its AI event looked like an opportunity. AMD was steady on Friday. Was the Club stock hurt by fact that Amazon Web Services wasn't there? Melius Research suggests that might be it. The rest of the big players were included: Microsoft, Oracle, OpenAI and Meta. We own Microsoft and Meta for the Club. 7. Goldman Sachs upped its price target on Nvidia to $150 a share from $135 and kept its buy rating on the stock. Toshiya Hari, a noted analyst, told clients that after meeting with CEO Jensen Huang and other execs, he has a better appreciation of Nvidia's competitive moat. On Thursday, Morgan Stanley reiterated Nvidia as a top pick. Nvidia is way ahead of everyone else. 8. Johnson & Johnson landed a huge win by forum shopping. A judge ruled that its subsidiary's third try at resolving tens of thousands of talc cases can stay in bankruptcy court in Texas. There is now a path out of this nightmare. Worth a look for risk-takers. 9. Barclays raised its price target on ServiceNow to $980 a share from $890, implying just a few percentage points of upside. Still, analysts kept their buy-equivalent overweight rating on the stock. Analysts said their supplier checks ticked down, making it tough to get very excited about the software earnings season. Did ServiceNow's business tick down though? I doubt it. 10. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway continued its sales of Bank of America stock this week. The latest trims brought Berkshire's stake in the bank below 10%, which means it will not have to report its sales within two business days to comply with U.S. securities law. Bank of America reports earnings Tuesday. Sign up for my Top 10 Morning Thoughts on the Market email newsletter for free (See here for a full list of the stocks at Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust.)

He pointed out that Florida is the second-largest consumer of natural gas for power in the U.S., behind only Texas. Natural gas for November delivery settled at $2.63 per million British thermal units, down 1.6% for the session and tallying a weekly loss of 7.8%.

Title: Shoplifting on the rise: ‘The amount of theft is unbelievable ... we have maybe three or four instances every day’
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/crime-law/2024/10/12/shoplifting-on-the-rise-were-vulnerable-were-having-to-protect-ourselves-it-creates-an-awful-sense-of-anxiety/
Time Published: 2024-10-11T11:15:14Z
Full Content:
Last week at Nine Crows, an independent vintage clothes shop in Temple Bar, Dublin, a staff member picked up the phone and dialled Pearse Street Garda station to report the theft of a pair of jeans from the shop moments earlier. While they were on the phone, another shoplifter made their way to the exit with stolen items from a shop display in hand. “In a matter of minutes – two separate incidents, two different people, two different thefts ... that’s how often it’s happening now,” says regional manager Faye Power. This year, according to Power, the rise in thefts at the Temple Bar shop – as well as at other locations across the city – has been “quick and fast”. Nine Crows is an independent business with limited resources for investing in security measures, and these crimes place a serious burden on the shop. “It’s just increasingly difficult. Like, what do you do? There’s rising costs across everything. A security guard isn’t obtainable for us,” says Power. “It’s not just us. [There are] six to eight shops in this area who are reporting daily, sometimes multiple times daily.” An increase in thefts is a nationwide problem. Figures released by the Central Statistics Office last month show that theft crime is at its highest level in five years. Analysis of theft and related offences, which were up by 8 per cent – or by 5,354 incidents in the 12 months to the second quarter of this year – showed nearly half or 49 per cent of such incidents involved theft from a shop. For Jim Kenny, who has run a Centra shop in Blackrock village in south Co Dublin for 27 years, theft became a serious issue following the Covid-19 pandemic. “Post Covid, the amount of theft was unbelievable,” says Kenny. “We have maybe three or four instances [of shoplifting] every day.” [ Shoplifting and burglary offences up, sex crimes and homicide downOpens in new window ] Tara Buckley, director general of the Retail Grocery Dairy and Allied Trades Association (RGDATA), says dealing with theft is a “daily occurrence” for the vast majority of the association’s members. A proportion of such offences at supermarkets is perpetrated by organised retail crime groups, she says. These groups seek high-value items such as alcohol, cigarettes and even costly cuts of meat. Other offenders include “serial” shoplifters, she says, and young people “who feel like they’re untouchable”. Kenny feels a lack of Garda resources allocated to support businesses in combating theft leaves shops – as well as owners and staff members – vulnerable. He lists various instances of shoplifting where assailants were threatening towards him or other workers. “We’re not being protected ... We’re vulnerable. We’re actually having to protect ourselves. It creates an awful sense of anxiety.” People shoplift for various reasons. There’s a lot of desperation ... and sometimes that can be a very unsafe situation for someone to be in Power says a dearth of policing resources makes businesses in Dublin city centre feel like they are not a priority. “It’s obvious at this point. Dublin people, Dublin businesses, aren’t a priority right now. We’re just not. And I think that the evidence will show you that ... How many times did we ring [about a theft] and we get a guard visit seven days later? What does that tell you?” Power stresses that although responding gardaí are often sympathetic and helpful in any way they can be, she believes those in decision-making roles within the force – and in Government – are failing to provide adequate support to businesses affected by rising theft. She says during big policing operations this summer – for high-profile football matches such as the Europa League final, and concerts such as Taylor Swift – instances of crime at the shop fell. “Because it’s just a known fact that when they’re [gardaí] walking around, we just don’t get that level of crime,” she says. “We don’t want staff to have to deal with this, but we’re being forced to deal with this because we’re not getting supports from the guards ... Really Government level, I suppose, is where it’s coming from.” Without support, Dublin will be left without the independent businesses that offer an alternative to fast-fashion giants, she says. Insp Damian Boland of the Garda National Crime Prevention Unit says retailers have expressed frustration to gardaí at tardy response times to theft reports, as well as a lack of feedback following a report being made. Insp Boland – who is in regular contact with retailers and their representative bodies through biannual forums and other conferences – says part of the reason for increased theft figures is the Garda’s active encouragement of retailers to report every theft. [ Retail group calls for share of Apple fundsOpens in new window ] Operation Tairge, he says, was launched last December as a direct response to the rise in retail theft. The operation aims to reduce retail crime, with a specific focus on organised retail crime groups (ORC) and recidivist offenders. Retail theft will never go away, he says, but he hopes that if more people are held responsible for crimes by gardaí, the rate of thefts will stagnate and fall. “From our point of view, we’re pushing for reports [of thefts] to go in ... if we go after the top offenders, and if we go after the ORCs, and make it less attractive for that kind of criminality,” he says. Since launching last December, several people have been before the courts on theft charges following Operation Tairge activity. According to Garda literature on Operation Tairge, retail theft “also has an impact on staff retention, recruitment and personal safety while at work”. Buckley says the level of aggression that sometimes goes with such instances is having a “huge impact” on owners, staff and their families. “A lot of staff find that it’s just too threatening and upsetting,” she says. “It’s hard to retain staff.” Staff safety is a key consideration for Nine Crows, Power adds. “I want people to feel comfortable working here in the city, and not having to be dealing with these situations. It can be very intimidating for people to be confronted with a situation like that. People shoplift for various reasons. There’s a lot of desperation ... and sometimes that can be a very unsafe situation for someone to be in.” Power believes the rise in theft might point to a wider societal issue. At their shop, people who commit theft come from “every walk of life”, she says. “It is just across all demographics of people.” “I don’t think many people go out every day for the craic, just to rob something – there is obviously a bigger issue here,” she says. “Are people struggling? Are costs just too high? Are people feeling under pressure? ... There could be various reasons why [people are] stealing at this point.” © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

By Arasu Kannagi Basil and Davide Barbuscia (Reuters) - BlackRock (NYSE:BLK)'s assets under management hit a record high for the third straight quarter as a U.S. stock market rally boosted inflows, while the world's largest asset manager continued a push to expand its footprint in private markets. Assets managed by BlackRock shot to $11.48 trillion in the period, compared with $9.10 trillion a year earlier and $10.65 trillion in the second quarter, the company said on Friday. That growth came as stocks reversed an August sell-off and broadened their rally in the third quarter, boosted by renewed hopes of a soft landing for the U.S. economy. BlackRock is expanding its offerings to become an all-in-one platform for investors by integrating public and private markets. "Our strategy is ambitious, and our strategy is working," Larry Fink, chairman and CEO, said in a statement. The company's shares were recently up 3.6% on Friday. They have advanced about 18% in 2024 as of last close, trailing the 21% jump in the S&P 500. Last week, the New York-based firm completed its $12.5 billion acquisition of Global Infrastructure Partners, adding over $100 billion in assets to its kitty. Later this year, it is expected to close its $3.2 billion acquisition of private markets data provider Preqin. The two deals are expected to bolster BlackRock's presence in infrastructure investments and in private markets, both key areas of growth. "Growing public deficits are only going to expand the role of private markets in powering economic growth," Fink said in an earnings call on Friday. BlackRock registered $160 billion in long-term net inflows in the third quarter. Total net inflows hit a quarterly record of $221.18 billion, up from $2.57 billion a year ago. A majority of the long-term inflows were captured by ETFs, at $97.41 billion. Clients poured in $62.74 billion into BlackRock's fixed-income products. Asset managers have contended with softer inflows in recent years as interest rate hikes boosted the appeal of safe-haven assets like cash. But with interest rates expected to fall as the Federal Reserve continues a long-anticipated easing cycle it kicked off in September, some of that money could flow into assets such as fixed income products, a development Fink said could occur in a more “normalized” but "relatively high-rate environment.” Equity market benchmarks finished higher in the third quarter, with the S&P 500 gaining 5.4%, while the MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe rose 6.2%. BlackRock's net income rose to $1.63 billion, or $10.90 per share, in the three months ended Sept. 30, from $1.60 billion, or $10.66 per share, a year earlier. "The combination of a strong ETF franchise, an expansion into private markets, a favorable market tailwind, and contributions from acquisitions combined to widen the moat around BlackRock,” said Catherine Seifert, equity analyst at CFRA.

Title: IOG CEO: Cardano (ADA) ‘Wants To Be a Real Cryptocurrency and Not the Patron of BlackRock and Wall Street for Number Go Up Preferences’
URL: https://www.cryptoglobe.com/latest/2024/10/iog-ceo-cardano-ada-wants-to-be-a-real-cryptocurrency-and-not-the-patron-of-blackrock-and-wall-street-for-number-go-up-preferences/
Time Published: 2024-10-11T10:20:50Z
Full Content:
Charles Hoskinson, co-creator of Cardano (ADA), addressed the recent shift in sentiment surrounding Cardano in a post on X on October 10. According to Hoskinson, the negative discourse is not indicative of failure but rather a consequence of the implementation of the Voltaire governance phase. He suggested that long-standing issues, such as unmet roadmap objectives, unfunded strategies, and partnerships that haven’t been formed, are coming to the forefront now that the ecosystem is transitioning to a more adaptive governance model under Voltaire. Hoskinson acknowledged that the ecosystem has not previously scaled to address the evolving needs of the community, but he expressed confidence that Voltaire’s governance framework is capable of addressing these concerns. He shared that he, too, has a lengthy list of unresolved issues that could not be tackled prior to this shift in governance. Specifically, Hoskinson mentioned that working with a Cardano Native Asset (CNA) — as part of the Midnight project — has made him acutely aware of challenges such as liquidity and asset custody. While he plans to continue contributing to these areas, he emphasized that the new on-chain governance model will also take on the responsibility of solving these issues. He referenced stablecoin support as another area where the governance structure will play a vital role in ensuring growth and security. Hoskinson contrasted Cardano’s open governance approach with other cryptocurrency projects, stating that Cardano’s commitment to transparency and public decision-making distinguishes it from others in the space. According to Hoskinson, while other projects may rely on opaque “backroom deals,” Cardano operates in a manner that is transparent to its global community, which spans over 100 countries. He stressed that the ecosystem’s governance is dedicated to long-term progress and integrity, standing in contrast to short-term market manipulation or companies seeking financial benefits. Hoskinson concluded by reinforcing that Cardano is not in decline but is instead thriving and growing. He asserted that Cardano remains dedicated to its goal of being a genuine cryptocurrency, as opposed to aligning with financial giants like BlackRock or catering to the preferences of Wall Street, whose focus he criticized as being driven solely by financial gain. You all may have noticed that the Twitter sentiment around Cardano has been more negative lately. This change isn't a reflection of our project somehow failing, but rather the desired result of Voltaire. There have been years of pent-up grievances, unexplored road map items,… On October 8, Cardano Ambassador Mauro Andreoli announced via the social media platform X that he and Lucas Macchia had successfully signed the first legally enforceable contract on the Cardano blockchain. The contract, compliant with Argentine law, marks a significant step toward the integration of blockchain technology into the legal realm. Andreoli emphasized that this agreement can be upheld in court, allowing any violations to be pursued legally, with obligations fulfilled in Cardano’s native cryptocurrency, ADA. The contract was a loan agreement between Andreoli and Macchia, valued at 10,000 ADA, with a four-month repayment term and a 10% interest rate. According to Andreoli, the transaction was notarized using a unique transaction ID, which is referenced in the legal documents attached to the agreement. Although Andreoli expressed excitement about this milestone, he mentioned that the full details of the contract remain private, as they include sensitive information such as his ID number, home address, and wallet information. Andreoli highlighted the importance of this event, calling it a major milestone for both the Cardano ecosystem and blockchain technology in Argentina. He believes that this legally enforceable smart contract paves the way for further use of blockchain in legal agreements, establishing legal precedents and simplifying future transactions. This development could potentially encourage the widespread adoption of blockchain-based agreements across various industries. He also discussed the adaptability of the framework, suggesting that the same structure could be applied to other types of contracts, such as real estate leases, purchase agreements, and other business transactions requiring legal support. The existing legal framework in Argentina, combined with the flexibility of blockchain contracts, provides a solid foundation for future growth and development in the space. Andreoli further pointed out that this milestone doesn’t just benefit individuals but could also open doors for businesses in the Cardano ecosystem. He mentioned companies such as NMKR, EMURGO, Lago, and PALM Economy, which could use this development to establish legally sound operational frameworks, enhancing trust and credibility in blockchain-based business models.4o This structure and the associated benefits will also enable all companies within the Cardano ecosystem, such as @nmkr_io , @emurgo_io , @IagonOfficial , and @palmeconomy , to legally structure their businesses if they choose to do so.

"The combination of a strong ETF franchise, an expansion into private markets, a favorable market tailwind, and contributions from acquisitions combined to widen the moat around BlackRock,” said Catherine Seifert, equity analyst at CFRA.

REUTERS/Carlo Allegri/File Photo BlackRock's assets under management hit a record high for the third straight quarter on Friday, helped by surging inflows to the company's exchange-traded funds and a searing equity rally that boosted the value of its clients' investments. Stock markets overcame the August selloff and broadened their rally in the third quarter, driven by renewed hopes of a soft landing for the world's largest economy after encouraging inflation data. The broader equity market benchmarks finished higher in the third quarter, with the S&P 500 gaining 5.4 per cent, while the MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe rose 6.2 per cent. Assets managed by BlackRock shot up to $11.48 trillion in the third quarter, up from $9.10 trillion a year earlier and $10.65 trillion in the second quarter. The world's largest asset manager registered $160 billion in long-term net flows in the third quarter. Total net flows hit a quarterly record of $221.18 billion, up from $2.57 billion a year ago. A majority of the inflows were captured by ETFs, at $97.41 billion. Meanwhile, clients poured in $62.74 billion into BlackRock's fixed-income products. Asset managers have contended with softer inflows in recent years as rate hikes boosted the appeal of safe-haven assets like cash. Some investors also sat on the sidelines, waiting for more certainty on the interest-rate trajectory, before stepping back into riskier assets. But with the U.S. Federal Reserve finally kicking off its long-anticipated easing cycle, asset managers are poised to benefit as huge piles of cash on the sidelines move into riskier assets such as fixed-income products. BlackRock's net income rose to $1.63 billion, or $10.90 per share, in the three months ended September 30, from $1.60 billion, or $10.66 per share, a year earlier. Its shares have advanced about 18 per cent in 2024 as of last close, trailing the 21 per cent jump of the S&P 500.

Title: Cardano Hosts First Legally Enforceable Smart Contract In Argentina As Hoskinson Asserts ADA Isn’t Dying

The Cardano network has achieved a major feat by hosting its first legally enforceable smart contract signed in Argentina and under the jurisdiction of its courts. Input Output Global chief technology officer Romain Pellerin highlighted this historic feat in a recent post on X, stating: “Cardano paves the way of legally enforceable smart contracts in Argentina.” #Cardano paves the way of legally enforceable smart contracts in Argentina 🇦🇷Congrats @MauroAndreoliA et al. 🖖#web3 #lawonchain https://t.co/8Psfb1NRCe Cardano ambassador Mauro Andreoli recently announced to the Cardano community the signing of the first legally and judicially enforceable contract on the Cardano network, over which Argentina’s courts have jurisdiction. The contract is a loan agreement between Andreoli and Lucas Macchia for 10,000 Cardano (ADA) tokens — valued at around $3,380 — with four-month repayment at a 10% interest rate. The pair also signed a legal document outlining important details of the smart contract loan, including the blockchain and wallet used and the Transaction ID. Andreoli posited in an Oct. 8 X post that this marks the first time an Argentine court can implement full payment in the ADA cryptocurrency from a Cardano smart contract: “We did it, we have just signed the first legally and judicially enforceable contract on the Cardano network, in full compliance with the laws of the Argentine Republic.” Andreoli further noted that the milestone could encourage Argentine courts to recognize smart contracts more widely as a technology for streamlining commercial transactions. “Legally, this establishes evidence and streamlines procedural steps, marking the initial phase of creating favorable jurisprudence in the country and facilitating commercial transactions.” Cardano creator Charles Hoskinson has reiterated his conviction in the Cardano blockchain amid negative sentiment escalation. “Cardano isn’t dying. It’s thriving and growing. It’s also one of the last cryptocurrencies that still wants to be a real cryptocurrency and not the patron of Blackrock and Wall Street for number go up preferences,” Hoskinson wrote. In a long post on X, Hoskinson suggested the reason negative sentiment around Cardano has increased recently is not about Cardano “somehow failing” but “rather the desired result of Voltaire.” The Cardano network transitioned to the Age of Voltaire on Sept. 1. He explained the reason for this: “There have been years of pent-up grievances, unexplored road map items, unfunded growth strategies, and needed partnerships that haven’t been addressed due to Cardano’s governance not scaling to meet the needs of the ecosystem.”

Cardano’s Co-founder, Charles Hoskinson, has taken it upon himself to address the upsurge in negative sentiments surrounding the Cardano ecosystem. Hoskinson highlighted a continuing trend of conversations amongst X users leaning towards a bearish position but insisted that it does not encapsulate the actual state of the Cardano network. “You all may have noticed that the Twitter sentiment around Cardano has been more negative lately. This change isn’t a reflection of our project somehow failing, but rather the desired result of Voltaire.” He wrote in a post shared on X. Like other blockchain networks, the Cardano network is no stranger to failed projects. In a report shared by AlphaQuest, Cardano topped the list on Dead Coins. Notably, 74% of projects on the network have become inactive, and as a result, Cardano has now emerged as one of the ten ecosystems with the most defunct coins. In his post, Hoskinson revealed that the development was associated with failing to scale Cardano’s governance to meet the ecosystem’s needs. Per his notations, the network has yet to explore several road map items, growth strategies, and partnerships necessary to drive growth. However, Hoskinson added that the presence of the Voltaire era, which is expected to bring about decentralization, is likely to turn things around. On September 1, 2024, Cardano completed the Chang Hard Fork, marking its official entrance into the highly anticipated Voltaire era. Another promising project is the Cardano Native Asset, which Hoskinson considers essential for the asset’s success. According to him, custody and liquidity are also essential. Hoskinson further emphasized the structure of Cardano, explaining that the network’s transparent landscape has played a major role in influencing public opinion. He went on to spotlight the role of the network’s on-chain government in its commitment to serving network users in over 100 countries. The Cardano boss stressed that “short-term thinking, market manipulation, and companies seeking a handout” have no place in the Cardano community. “Cardano isn’t dying. It’s thriving and growing. It’s also one of the last cryptocurrencies that still wants to be a real cryptocurrency and not the patron of Blackrock and Wall Street for number go-up preferences.” He asserted.
