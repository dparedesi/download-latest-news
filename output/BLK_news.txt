Title: Crypto’s second wave of ETFs arrives, investors snap up new Solana offering

A flurry of new crypto spot ETFs launched on Tuesday and Wednesday, meaning that mom-and-pop investors can now invest more easily in lesser-known cryptocurrencies. Until this week, these investors could only buy Bitcoin and Ethereum in ETF form, and based on initial demand, at least one of the new offerings is off to a roaring start. The new ETF provides exposure to Solana, the sixth most popular cryptocurrency. According to Eric Balchunas, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, the Bitwise Solana Staking ETF (BSOL) had the best ETF launch of 2025 in any asset class. Demand for other new ETFs, providing exposure to Litecoin and Hedera, was more muted. Although crypto exchanges like Coinbase have long sold these cryptocurrencies, the ETF wrappers mean investors can get exposure to these assets in the form of shares purchased through any brokerage. “For investors, this is about as McDonald’s easy as you can get,” said Balchunas in an interview with Fortune. “It’s low-cost, easy, and safe.” The launch of this latest crop of ETFs comes nearly two years after the Securities and Exchange Commission first opened the door to crypto funds in January 2024. That’s when the agency finally approved a bid by BlackRock and others to sell Bitcoin ETFs, following a nearly decade-long legal battle with the crypto industry. The first Ethereum ETFs launched later that year. Now, with the launch of ETFs for more obscure cryptocurrencies, traders will have access to an even deeper array of digital assets. On Thursday, BSOL, the Solana ETF issued by crypto asset management firm Bitwise, saw $46 million of trading volume in its third day. By contrast, the Canary Hedera and Litecoin ETFs saw roughly $2.3 million and $500,000, respectively, in their third day. “BSOL did phenomenally well,” said Hunter Horsley, the CEO of Bitwise, in an interview with Fortune. “And I think it connected with a lot of investor demand.” Other issuers to launch Solana and Hedera ETFs are Grayscale and Canary, respectively. The race to launch new cryptocurrency ETFs is competitive, as first movers are better able to cultivate investor loyalty and gain a leg up on competitors who are slower to come to market. “It’s like the Ricky Bobby quote, ‘If you’re not first, you’re last,’” said Balchunas. “There’s a little of that in the ETF world. That’s why there’s such a rush to market.” The quest for a crypto ETF dates back to as early as 2013, when the Winklevoss twins —whose legal battle with Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg was popularized in the movie The Social Network—sought approval for a spot Bitcoin ETF. Spot Bitcoin ETFs, which track the current price of the popular cryptocurrency, became a white whale for those in the sector. But, under multiple administrations, the SEC rejected applications for them, citing the immaturity of the market and the potential for manipulation. In 2021, the agency approved a Bitcoin futures ETF, but not a spot fund. In 2022, Grayscale, a prominent crypto asset manager, sued the agency for allowing futures-based but not spot funds. Grayscale won the case in August 2023. In 2024, a select few spot ETFs launched to record success. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) attracted $70 billion in total assets more quickly than any other ETF. Its Ethereum fund (ETHA) also set record inflows. Under the Trump administration, the floodgates for spot crypto ETFs flew open after the SEC updated its guidance in July. But the recently launched ETFs for Solana, Hedera, and Litecoin appear to make use of new guidance that the SEC issued at the start of the ongoing federal government shutdown. While the exact technicalities of how these issuers were justifying the listing of their new funds were unclear to Balchunas, he said that they were being opportunistic. “These issuers are very crafty. They found phrasing in guidance put out by the SEC about what to do in the shutdown,” he added. Balchunas also predicted that XRP, the fifth biggest cryptocurrency, would be the next crypto ETF to launch. “If I had to bet $1,000, I would say it would launch a couple of weeks after the government comes back,” he said. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: October 2025 in Review

The Site Happy Halloween and all that… and on a Friday no less. Stay safe out there. As for the site, both long time readers might recall me complaining endlessly about how changing the time setting of the blog from UTC to US Pacific time changed my posting streak, which began on March 29, 2020, which would be 2,042 days ago, to starting in May 2023 because the time zone change put one post or another into a different day. I used to post at all hours of the day and night. I mostly used to post at 17:15 UTC, or 10:15 local time, which somehow got converted oddly. Anyway, after bitching about it for well over a year, I finally did something about it. I went back and correct some times… because it turns out that WP.com did some odd things to times when I did that change… to see if, you know, that might actually work. And it did. Granted, it didn’t work in one fell swoop. I basically had to go to the next date that got screwed up and fix the times there, so my streak count went from 857 to 987 to 1252, to whatever, as I worked my way back, day by day, to each screw up. And it was strange, because there were, in fact, no day gaps so far as I could tell. It just freaked out about some times that were past 18:00 around the DST changes. So, basically, bad WP.com code. But I got there. The TAGN Streak – Battlefield 2042 Does this really matter? Am I a better person because WP.com now correctly displays my post streak? Or does this really say more about my own mental defects? Yeah, you probably know the answer better than I. Meanwhile, in comment comedy this month, I have had a repeat commenter from Portland, Oregon (judging from his IP address… remember kids, I can see that) who keeps complaining about my blog appearing on their Kindle and asking that I remove my content from their device. Please.remove this web sight from my kindle At first I thought this was a joke, but it has come up a few times. And I can’t really help them. I recall that there is some minimal browser available on the Kindle, but how things get bookmarked or whatever, no idea. I use the Kindle app on the iPad. One Year Ago LOTRO, EverQuest, and EverQuest II all announced their coming expansions so close together that I just put them all in a single post. Blizzard kicked off the World of Warcraft 20th Anniversary festivities. I was asking, not for the first time, when WoW Classic should end. Is there a point when it just isn’t “classic” anymore, or are we on the ride to catch up to retail? Actually in the game, the instance group was still working through Cataclysm Classic, taking on The Lost City of Tol’vir, with a bit of Coren Direbrew on the side. We were also out there with many others farming Wintergrasp for honor. Tol Barad was just bad. Wintergrasp was generally an Alliance walk over, unless we pulled the Horde pre-made group. Then we got worked. We also cheesed the Vault of Archavon in Wintergrasp, because why not? Then we started testing the waters for heroic Deadmines. That was getting us to the end of the expansion so far as we were concerned, so I was wondering how much longer the whole thing would drag on. (Until July 2025, which was too damn long for me.) In EVE Online, the Crimson Harvest event, one of only two regular annual events at this point, kicked off once more. The candidate list for the CSM19 elections was announced, so the campaigning could begin in earnest. Shortly thereafter Alcoholic Satan was removed from CSM18 and dropped from the CSM19 ballot. It isn’t a realm CSM if there isn’t some drama. Then the election started. (And the Alliance Tournament kicked off as well.) When the polls closed we got the results and saw who would be on CSM19. We also got a date for the upcoming Revenant expansion. There was also the MER, which seemed to indicate we were coming out of the “summer slump,” if you believe in that. I did a Friday bullet points post with more about the AT, more Revenant details, the announcement of the Empires of EVE: Vol III project, the current PLEX price crisis (not helped by Torvald Uruz destroying 38,400 PLEX as part of his dramatic rage quit), EVE Galaxy Conquest, and finally getting my 20th Anniversary Collectors Edition delivered (18 months after the 20th anniversary). Then, as the month closed out, CCP finally forced everybody into mandatory participation with the Equinox sov changes. Yay, rejuvenation or something. Actually in New Eden, there was a State of the Goonion meeting that announced our Migration from Delve to Tenerifis. Let the big move begin! This seemed to dismay and confuse PanFam leadership, who had barely fought back claiming that Goons would get tired and go home. The Reavers SIG also celebrated a decade of not existing. The actual move was being handled by stages, with everybody getting to the regional gate between Querious and Catch. (And when I write “everybody” I mean maybe 40% of the alliance. People were still panic moving months later.) Then there was a massive op for crossing the regional gate. And then more move ops. More ops all the time. I also went on my own side adventure, avoiding the regional gate as I moved a black ops battleship and a blockade runner through an alternate route. This all led to Brave finally taking 1DQ1-A and being declared the winner of World War Bee. The Stars Reach pre-alpha carried on with a test of some new tools, then there was a test for combat and new ranger skills, I tried out Galaxicus, the spiritual successor to Stellar Emperor / MegaWars 3. Also, our binge watching habits continued, with another post summarizing what we had been watching. Five Years Ago I started using that 34″ ultra-wide monitor. Coincidentally, I also started complaining about the UI in games being too small and hard to read if they lacked a reasonable scaling option. Somebody at Google Stadia was ranting about making streamers pay. Is there something in the water that makes people this dumb? Blizzard delayed the Shadowlands expansion. But they were building up for the AQ war supply event in WoW Classic. And we got a late November launch date before the month was out. WoW seemed to be hanging on according to the Q3 2020 results. I was also wondering if we were going to get a level squish with every WoW expansion going forward. And then the big level squish patch hit and all our level 120 characters were suddenly level 60. The only thing was to try it out, though it was a bit strange. The new Exile’s Reach starter area was… new. We put together a little group to try the level squished Northrend. Ula made us an instance group video about our time in Sunken Temple. Then there was the running of the Gnomes. And then we started some prep for a little instance called Blackrock Depths. Meanwhile, StarCraft II fell off of Blizzard’s active development list. The EverQuest team announced the Claws of Veeshan expansion, the EverQuest II team announced the Reign of Shadows expansion, and the Lord of the Rings Online launched their War of Three Peaks expansionette. And in EVE Online World War Bee was in full swing, with PAPI finally trying to gain a foothold in Mother Delve. That led to Guinness World Record setting battles, which CCP got us ready for by introducing a UI Only mode to the game. That was some timing. I’ll sum up the war as a list: And outside of the war I did a bit of quiet mining in the new ore distribution plan. The Reavers SIG turned six years old. We got a Crimson Harvest event for Halloween. The Howling Interdictors update gave us stasis bubbles. And then there were the Triglavians. They captured 27 empire systems and, with another update, they were yanked into a new Triglavian region named Pochven. Farewell Niarja. Sean Connery, the favorite James Bond of many, passed away. Finally, there was the tale of the Canadian visitor. Ten Years Ago I opened up the month with a post about the Mineserver Kickstarter campaign, a little box that promised to make hosting easy! A pity is never came to anything… and that I basically threw money into nothing. Then there was the now perennial complaint about customers being too cheap to by any and every 99 cent game. It is because your 99 cent game sucks. In EverQuest II, the Desert of Flames expansion unlock votes passed on Stormhold and Deathtoll, which made me ponder the pacing of nostalgia. Daybreak seemed to want to go faster. Daybreak also have expansion announcements for EverQuest and EverQuest II that included pricey special editions. Milk ’em while you got ’em I guess. But PlanetSide 2 was having problems attracting subscribers. EverQuest II was consolidating servers, so it was farewell to Crushbone. In Lord of the Rings Online, server consolidation was just getting under way as well. Crowfall was still in development, but had announced some costly RMT castles. Guild Wars 2 launched the Heart of Thorns expansion. I picked up the Reaper of Souls expansion for Diablo III and made it through Act V. My wife and I went to EVE Vegas where we partied and heard about the planned Citadel expansion. I brought some give-aways for the trip, which I covered, along with Pirate’s Little Helper, in a Friday bullet points post. Meanwhile, in New Eden I was very impressed with the multi-buy feature that came in with the previous month’s Vanguard release. I was also wondering if space priests were a problem. I also went pipe bombing for the first time. The month’s Blog Banter wanted to know about my PC. And Reavers celebrated their first anniversary. Over in one corner New Eden SpaceMonkeys Alliance (SMA) stole ISK from EVE Online casino I Want ISK who, in turn, hired low sec mercenaries to camp SMA space, starting the embers of what would become the Casino War. And the sad tale of CCP and White Wolf came to an end as CCP sold off the subsidiary and its neglected IP, World of Darkness. Finally, in Minecraft, Aaron began his draining of an ocean monument, and I was interested in bases, several of which sprang up as I worked on the Great Northern Road. Fifteen Years Ago I had some hopes and expectations for BlizzCon. They were pretty much unmet. But Blizzard had already announced the Cataclysm ship date, so what else did I expect? I asked if people ever look at the items in the blog side-bar. People mostly do not. EverQuest launched the House of Thule expansion. I finished building my new computer. Windows 7 64-bit was the wave of the future… unless you wanted to take that LOTRO survey. The EVE Online screen shot contest wrapped up, winners were declared and prizes were sent out. I was playing Lords of Ultima innocently enough and then somebody attacked me! Oh noes! I was suddenly determined to “catch them all” and finish the National Pokedex in Pokemon SoulSilver. The instance group was playing in LOTRO, which had been live as a Free to Play game for one month. In-game, we were subjected to the disturbing habits of some of the residents of the Lone Lands, while I indulged in one of my own habits, the mid-game character swap. And then I made one post completely unreadable by making anagrams out of all the proper nouns. I had to repost a corrected version. I bought Civilization V, which like every Civilization launch, had issues with my current computer. The unwritten rule of Civilization is that you need to upgrade your machine in order for the game to play well. LEGO Universe launched. My daughter and I were drinking new and interesting sodas and I was really hoping that the SF Giants could make it to a World Series victory. Twenty Years Ago Club Penguin, the browser based, kid friendly MMO, launched. Pity about Disney screwing the whole thing up. Civilization IV launched and, as with all Civ launches, the game really needed the next generation of hardware to run in its full glory. I recall submitting a bug and getting a response telling me to stop trying to play with so many civilizations in a single game. Age of Empires III also launched. While it was well reviewed, and we all bought a copy, it never really eclipsed Age of Empires II in my heart. The second game remains the pinnacle of the series for me. Twenty-Five Years Ago The PlayStation 2 launches in North America. Pokemon Gold & Silver arrive in North America. Regional launches were a thing back then. Forty-Five Years Ago Berzerk arrives in arcades. I remember this game showing up and dropping a lot of quarters to play it. It said things.

I managed to get through purple stakes with the checkered deck, the one I find the easiest to run with in that you can go all in on flushes pretty easily. Now I am working on orange stakes, the next to last level… and it is a thing. But it is a rogue-like, which means you just keep starting over until the RNG favors you. EVE Online What did I do in New Eden? Nothing very eventful I guess. I went on a couple of ops, did a bit of the Crimson Harvest event, tended my planets, ratted again a little bit, voted for CSM20, and started accumulating skill points for the Catalyst expansion coming in November. Nothing really exciting, just playing the game in kind of a low key way. No Man’s Sky We might have hit the end of Corvette Summer or whatever. I had already gone back to mostly exploring and the basic game play loop of discovery and moving on. We did try our hand at base building… and it was not very satisfying. I still have more to say about that. Then there was Expedition 20, which Potshot and I both got through, though there were some hurdles as noted. Palia The new game for some of us in the group. Despite it being mostly the housing and crafting portion of an MMO, with scant adventure available, it does press enough of the “progress quest” character advancement buttons without giving you too early on, so you always feel like you are working towards something. We’ll see how long it lasts, but for now it is a pretty chill game. Palworld We’ve been moving slowly here. This has become the Sunday afternoon game, but only if we have the full group. And, being adults with responsibilities and obligations and all that, it doesn’t always come together. But we persist. Pokemon Go The big October update still seems strange to me. Adding new levels to engage you level capped players… and then changing the level curve so that same players just skip past 20 of the 30 levels added… well, it is a bold strategy. So I have xp to get me to level 74 already, we’re just caught up in the tasks required for each of the last ten levels. Coming Up It is the start of the run up to the holidays. It will also be the prime season for high quality ads, so we’ll see if ad revenue for the site goes up. (Please use an ad blocker plugin with your browser. If you’re somebody who reads this far in, I don’t want to tax/annoy you. I want to tax comment spam bots.) In EVE Online we will have the Catalyst expansion coming mid month. That will shake things up a bit; new ships, new login rewards, new Twitch drops and all of that. Enshrouded is also supposed to get its next big update. It was supposed to be this month, but it got pushed out to “October 42nd” according to the community team. Best not to ship too early. It is quite possible we might get one of the three planned Daybreak expansions before the end of the month. I’d bet on LOTRO being the first, but we’ll see. Took your first Blaugust very seriously, did you? LikeLike Actually that lines up with Blapril, which was the sixth run, when during early Covid we decided to do Blaugust early because we were all stuck at home and had plenty of time to write. It just so happens I have worked from home since then, which has meant more time for writing since I no longer have a commute. LikeLiked by 1 person Δ Email Address: Email Posts to Me!

AI announcements from Orion, SS&C and Boosted.ai and alts tech news from Envestnet and SignatureFD with CAIS. October 31, 2025 Wealthtech provider Orion announced Denali AI this week, the company’s new enterprise intelligence platform that will power what the company is referring to as its AI-first ecosystem, when it is fully available. For now, the technology remains in beta with select Orion advisory firm clients. Broad availability is expected sometime in 2026 at which time details on pricing and other aspects of Denali will be provided, according to the firm. The AI has been built to connect every system and workflow across the Orion technology ecosystem. On the Orion website, the company calls the technology “Your Firm’s AI Command Center,” stating it was designed to provide a firm’s administrators with full control and visibility into their AI environment, including usage data, activity logs and other connected sources and will be where firms define their AI-related configurations, set and align policies, and ensure that the AI matches a firm’s compliance and governance standards. “Orion Denali AI is the cornerstone of Orion’s future … by combining automation that expands capacity, insights that anticipate client needs, and intelligence that supports better decisions,” said Reed Colley, president of Orion Advisor Technology, in a statement. Orion demonstrated artificial intelligence assistants and other AI-driven features at the Future Proof conference in September. Related:Financial Monitoring Application Carefull Announces AI This week, Envestnet announced the launch of two managed model portfolios that include interval funds on its platform. The new funds are available through Envestnet’s Strategist UMA. The new models integrate semi-liquid and liquid strategies, enabling seamless allocation to alternatives with point-and-click simplicity, according to Dana D'Auria, co-CIO and Group President of Envestnet Solutions, in a statement. The first two models are from Franklin Templeton and BlackRock, with others slated for 2026 from Fidelity Investments and State Street. The Franklin Templeton fund has five risk-based options ranging from Conservative to Aggressive. The portfolio will incorporate a 10% allocation to alternatives. The BlackRock fund is a multi-asset income fund with private market models and incorporates public and private credit, covered call strategies and dividend-focused equities. Neither fund will require subscription documents, and both provide simplified tax reporting. Last week, Envestnet announced the appointment of Bhaskar Peddhapati as chief technology officer. He will be responsible for all aspects of technology, engineering and information security across the company. He most recently ran the mortgage technology team at Cotality (formerly CoreLogic). Related:WealthStack Roundup: bQuest Joins The Founders Arena SS&C this week announced the launch of its AI agent catalogue. The available agents, which were developed, tested and used within SS&C prior to their external availability, range in their use cases from trade reconciliation and validation to contract analysis. The agents are delivered as a managed service, designed to help organizations overcome talent shortages and operational bottlenecks. Annuity carrier American Life, an SS&C customer, for example, is currently evaluating SS&C’s Credit Agreement Document Agent for possible use in streamlining the processing of its private credit operations by having the AI agent review and update lengthy loan documents. The agents in its catalogue have been built using SS&C’s AI Gateway, which provides secure, auditable access to large language models and employs real-time guardrails for advanced security and data loss protection, real-time risk monitoring, and explainability of actions. And SS&C offers a range of deployment options, including hosting the AI Agents and AI Gateway on its own privately owned GPU infrastructure in ISO-compliant data centers, ensuring full custody of client data. Boosted.ai has launched voice-powered AI research agents, making it the first investment research platform that enables analysts and advisors to converse with a research agent in real-time. Boosted.ai has integrated the natural language voice technology from ElevenLabs, meaning that those employing Boosted.ai’s Alfa agent can speak to it naturally, in real time, when making queries. In a prepared statement, Boosted.ai provided the following hypothetical to illustrate how a verbal conversation might proceed: Portfolio Manager: “Hey Alfa, look at companies in the S&P 500 with a dividend yield over 2% and a price-to-earnings ratio greater than 15. Then read earnings transcripts, SEC filings, and news for those stocks over the last 3 months and summarize their exposure to China.” Boosted.ai Alfa response: “I’ve identified 27 names, concentrated in industrials, consumer staples, and energy. A significant number have meaningful exposure to China, both as a revenue source and a supply chain dependency. Would you like me to group them by sector or by level of exposure?” While not a household name for most financial advisors, Boosted.ai launched in 2017 and is perhaps better known to asset and investment managers; it raised $15 million in funding last November. SignatureFD Partners with CAIS, DFA, Axcelus on Tax-Advantaged PPLI Vehicle SignatureFD, an RIA with $10 billion in assets, launched AutographFD, an operating division that will allow investors to allocate money to both public and private investment strategies within the tax-advantaged private placement life insurance wrapper. The RIA is partnering with alternative investment platform CAIS on private strategies, Dimensional Fund Advisors on public strategies and Innovator on defined outcome strategies. Autograph has incorporated AI into its platform to educate investors on alternative strategies and streamline the process of getting PPLI for clients. Axcelus Financial, with which SignatureFD has a long-term relationship, will be providing the insurance. According to Doug Liptak, chief strategy officer at SigntureFD and founder of AutographFD, PPLI has traditionally been available on the very high end of the private investor market, to family offices with over $100 million in assets. AutographFD makes PPLI available to qualified purchasers with $3-million-plus in investable assets, although the average users will likely be investors with $10 million in assets. Liptak noted that both end-investors and outside financial advisors have responded to news of AutographFD development with enthusiasm since it allows for tax-free growth of PPLI investments and simplified administration, with no K-1 forms, capital calls or subscription documents that need to be signed. “It’s a better way to access alternatives from a tax-free standpoint,” he said. “Autograph allows you to do it all inside an institutionally priced policy and then get the tax benefits.” Davis Janowski Senior Technology Editor, WealthManagement.com Davis Janowski is a New York-based technology journalist whose work spans consumer, business and the FinTech sectors.

Title: Meta’s $27 billion bet turns AI compute into Wall Street’s hottest new investment
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/10/31/metas-27-billion-bet-turns-ai-compute-into-wall-streets-hottest-new-investment/

Sharon Goldman is an AI reporter at Fortune and co-authors Eye on AI, Fortune’s flagship AI newsletter. She has written about digital and enterprise tech for over a decade. Are data centers the new REIT? Not quite — but Meta’s new mega–data center in northeast Louisiana marks what one expert calls a “decisive shift” in how hyperscalers finance the AI era: by turning data centers into a new investable asset class. “This is where capital markets meet compute,” said Sean McDevitt, a partner at management consulting firm Arthur D. Little, which provided commercial due diligence advice to Meta. Traditionally, tech giants like Meta, Google, and Microsoft have funded their data center buildouts directly. This time, Meta is partnering with Blue Owl Capital, a private-credit investment firm, on the $27 billion data center known as Hyperion. As reported by The Wall Street Journal, Blue Owl owns 80% of the project, while Meta holds 20%, operating and leasing the facility long-term. BlackRock bought more than $3 billion of bonds that the joint venture (dubbed Beignet) issued last week to finance the project, in a sale arranged by Morgan Stanley. The deal stands out for its scale—the largest private-debt offering ever—and for its A+ rating from S&P, which reflects Meta’s backing of the project (albeit with just a single agency rating). Yet the debt had a yield of 6.58% at issue, a level closer to high-yield, or “junk,” bond territory. That structure allows Meta to build its data center without putting the full $27 billion of debt on its own balance sheet. The approach—known as a special-purpose vehicle (SPV) or off–balance-sheet financing—is largely new territory for hyperscale infrastructure. “By being able to access outside capital, you’re not limited to your own free cash flow generation,” McDevitt said. “You’re bringing on investors with return profiles on an infrastructure-type investment that allows companies to build bigger, larger, quicker, and faster.” He compared it to taking out a mortgage: you can buy a bigger house—or, in this case, build more data centers—by borrowing instead of paying cash up front. McDevitt believes the Hyperion deal could become a template for the industry. He estimates that roughly $150 billion in AI-driven data center construction is coming in the next few years. If other hyperscalers—Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and OpenAI among them—adopt similar models, capital markets rather than tech companies themselves will effectively fund the infrastructure of the AI era. “This is replicable,” he said, though he cautioned that it remains to be seen how the project performs in practice. “Now what has to happen? Meta has to build this thing, then put workloads in it and operate under the presumption that they’ll monetize those computing loads driven by AI in the future,” McDevitt added. That is precisely where criticism of the deal lies: According to Global Data Center Hub analysis, “If AI workloads or margins stumble, these SPVs could echo the dark-fiber overbuild of the 1990s vast capacity sitting idle while debt remains outstanding.” Still, for now, there’s no reason to think other major banks won’t try the same thing, said McDevitt. “Why wouldn’t others look to mimic [this deal]?” Sharon GoldmanX: @sharongoldmanEmail: sharon.goldman@fortune.com Submit a deal for the Term Sheet newsletter here.

Title: Who is Bankim Brahmbhatt? Indian-origin CEO under BlackRock's radar for ‘breathtaking’ $500 million scam in US?

Time Published: 2025-10-31T11:29:58Z

An Indian-origin CEO is at the heart of a $500 million scam that targeted the world’s biggest investment group BlackRock’s private-credit investing arm and other lenders, the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday. According to the WSJ report, BlackRock’s private credit investment arm, HPS Investment Partners, are now trying to recover the money after falling victim to what it calls a ‘breathtaking’ fraud. Bankim Brahmbhatt, the owner of US-based Broadband Telecom and Bridgevoice, has been accused of fabricating accounts receivable that were supposed to be used as loan collateral. The lawsuit, filed in August, alleges that HPS had provided loans to Brahmbhatt's companies on the condition that they pledged millions of dollars owed by customers as collateral for the money. The lenders have now accused that Brahmbhatt’s companies owe them more than $500 million. BlackRock has also claimed that when the verification process of the account receivables started, it was found that the funds from the loan was diverted offshore accounts in India and Mauritius. According to the WSJ report quoting people familiar with the matter, BNP Paribas helped BlackRock’s HPS Investment Partners finance the loans to Brahmbhatt's companies. HPS, which was bought earlier this year by BlackRock, started lending to at least one financing arm affiliated with Brahmbhatt’s telecom companies in September 2020. Since the case was filed in August, several companies linked to Brahmbhatt including New York-based invoice financing firm Carriox Capital, have since filed for Chapter 11 protection in the US. Meanwhile, the lenders in their lawsuit said that Brahmbhatt had used fake invoices, contracts and emails over the past two years to make it appear as if the money was owed to established telecom companies. “Brahmbhatt created an elaborate balance sheet of assets that existed only on paper,” lawyers for the lenders wrote. Following its initial 2020 credit, HPS hiked the amount of its debt investment to about $385 million in early 2021, and then to around $430 million in August 2024. Nearly half of the loan to Brahmbhatt’s Carriox and affiliated entities were financed by BNP Paribas, the people quoted by WSJ said. According to the report, an HPS employee in July had noticed the irregularities with certain email addresses that purportedly came from Carriox customers. That led to suspicions, with HPS officials enquiring Bankim Brahmbhatt about the alleged irregularities. At the time, the businessman had assured them nothing was wrong, but later stopped picking up their calls. When an HPS employee visited the offices of Brahmbhatt in New York's Garden City in July, they were found to be closed. On Wednesday, office suite was locked and appeared vacant, and nobody answered the bell at his listed residence in Garden City. Two BMWs, a Porsche, a Tesla and an Audi were seen parked in the driveway, and a package next to the front door lay unattended. HPS has told some clients they believed Brahmbhatt is in India, according to the report. Bankim Brahmbhatt is the founder of Bankai Group, and has been in the telecom industry for over three decades. His companies Broadband Telecom and Bridgevoice sell services and infrastructure to other telecom companies. The LinkedIn account of Bankim Brahmbhatt seemed to be deleted when Mint tried to access it. Catch all the Business News , Corporate news , Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint.

Title: We broke down the eye-popping AI spending for 4 Big Tech firms — and their plans to go even harder next year

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Big Tech's AI gold rush isn't slowing down— it's getting more expensive. Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft all opened their wallets wider than ever this quarter, logging record-breaking capital expenditures on AI chips, servers, and data centers. Microsoft was the top spender at nearly $35 billion, narrowly beating Amazon. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the company could increase its long-term asset spending, or capital expenditure (capex), by as much as 24% next year. Each company said it planned to spend even more on capex going forward. A few recent deals exemplify this trend. Amazon this week opened an $11 billion data center in Indiana, part of its massive AI supercluster called Project Rainier, and said it would spend $5 billion on data centers in South Korea. Microsoft recently joined a consortium of investors to buy 50 data centers in the US and Latin America for $40 billion. Even Apple, a notoriously restrained spender compared to the other hyperscalers, told investors that it expects capex spending to increase in the next fiscal year. Investors are watching closely: companies showing early AI payoffs, like Google, are being rewarded, while others — like Meta — are running out of time to prove the spending spree is worth it. "After all the expensive hires and the capex ramp, Meta's grace period for showing investors something on the non-core AI side is nearly up," Bernstein senior analyst Mark Shmulik said Wednesday in a research note. The question for investors: which of these giants can turn that spending into actual AI returns — and which are just building costlier foundations for the future? Capital expenditures in the company's most recent fiscal quarter were driven by growing demand for cloud and AI offerings, Microsoft CFO Amy Hood said Wednesday. The nearly $35 billion in spending represents a 74% increase from the same time period last year. Roughly half of that spend went primarily to GPUs and CPUs, which Hood referred to as "short-lived assets." Microsoft spent $11.1 billion on data center leasing alone for the quarter. The company previously forecasted $30 billion in capex for the quarter. Amazon spent $34.2 billion in capex in the third quarter. The world's largest cloud provider said it expects to spend $125 billion this year in capex, up significantly from $83 billion in 2024. Amazon CFO Brian Olsavsky said the company plans to spend even more on capex in 2026 as it looks to double its data center capacity in the next two years. Meta spent $19.4 billion on capex in the third quarter, and is projecting 'notably higher growth' next year. Meta also adjusted its capex guidance range for 2025 from $70 billion to $72 billion, up from its previous estimate of $66 billion to $72 billion last quarter. That's almost double the amount — $39.2 billion total — Meta spent on capex in 2024. "We're seeing very high demand for additional compute," CEO Mark Zuckerberg told investors on the company's third-quarter earnings call Wednesday. The company expects to spend $116 billion to $118 billion on infrastructure costs next year, representing a 22% to 24% increase from 2025. Meta is building its own data centers and contracting space through third parties. It recently raised $29 billion for its massive data center project in Louisiana from firms including Pacific Investment Management Company and Blue Owl Capital. CFO Anat Ashkenazi told investors on the company's earnings call Wednesday that the "vast majority" of capex was spent on AI infrastructure. Approximately 60% of the spend went to chips and servers, while 40% went to networking equipment and data centers. Google raised its capex guidance for the year, projecting a range of $91 billion to $93 billion, up from its previous estimate of $85 billion. "We're continuing to invest aggressively due to the demand we're seeing from cloud customers, as well as the growth opportunities we see across the company," Ashkenazi said. Google parent Alphabet's stock jumped yesterday after it reported a boost in revenue growth from its cloud division in the third quarter. Wall Street seemed less concerned about its parent company's capex raise compared to those of its Big Tech peers. The third quarter was a "pretty solid flex" for Google, "around the AI bull case," Barclays analysts said in a research note on Wednesday. Jump to

Title: DeFi set for $2tn tokenisation boom: Standard Chartered picks the winners

About us Copy link DeFi is set for a $2 trillion boom. That’s according to Geoffrey Kendrick, head of digital assets research at UK bank Standard Chartered, who expects Wall Street’s surging adoption of blockchain technology will drive the tokenised real-world asset market to increase by over 5,600% by 2028. That number is excluding the stablecoin market, which has ballooned to be worth just under $308 billion in 2025, fuelled by a friendlier US government. “Stablecoins are creating a platform for DeFi to continue its expansion in the coming years,” Kendrick wrote. “Their success in 2025 has raised awareness in developed markets and created the necessary liquidity onchain to enable other DeFi solutions.” He predicted that tokenised money-market funds powered by stablecoins will make up $750 billion of the $2 trillion market. The rest of the market will be made up of $750 billion in tokenised equities, and $250 billion in tokenised funds, Kendrick said. “The less liquid segments of private equity, commodities, corporate debt and real estate for the other $250 billion,” he added. The comments highlight the bullishness around tokenised assets from traditional finance. BlackRock, State Street and Deutsche Bank are just some of the financial giants muscling into this space. Kendrick said the DeFi boom is driven by three factors: surging awareness in developed markets, onchain liquidity, and the expansion of onchain lending. Ethereum has and “key DeFi protocols like Aave are going to be the winners,” Kendrick said. Indeed, Aave, DeFi’s largest lending platform, recently relaunched its institutional platform to capitalise on Wall Street’s growing interest. Earlier this week, the Ethereum Foundation rolled out a new institutional platform titled Ethereum for Institutions, a site designed to guide traditional financial institutions in integrating Ethereum’s blockchain infrastructure. “Clear pathways are essential as institutions build on Ethereum,” the foundation said in its announcement. The US government’s drive to regulate the crypto market and to police the industry less strictly than during the Biden years has fuelled the rally. It has seen pro-crypto people be appointed to key government roles, seen a landmark stablecoin bill be signed into law, and Congress seems to be on the cusp of finalising a broad markets bill. To be sure, Kendrick warns that next year presents a massive danger that risks puncturing the growth. “The main risk to this would be if regulatory clarity in the US does not materialise — a possibility if the US administration is unable to push through regulatory changes before the November 2026 midterm elections, but not our base case,” he said.

Title: Meet the ex-McKinsey exec helping NYC's CEOs get comfortable with Zohran Mamdani

Every time Alex publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox! Enter your email By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Yasser Salem is not the sort of guy you'd expect to drop everything to get a socialist elected. When we met, he wore a white button-down, a tweed sport coat, and a baseball cap with a camouflage American flag on it that said "Husband, Daddy, Protector, Hero." There's no irony in his choice of hat. A McKinsey and Saudi Public Investment Fund alum who ran his own investment firm, the 43-year-old father of five is a fan of Ayn Rand and her brand of free-market individualism. Salem is now selling Zohran Mamdani's democratic socialist vision in New York City's boardrooms. In September, he launched OneNYC, a pro-Mamdani PAC that's raised nearly $400,000 from donors like Andrew Milgram, CEO of Marblegate Asset Management. While the PAC has spent money on ads — including $53,000 on a TV spot — Salem said its true goal is to act as a connective tissue between New York's business world and a populist candidate whose ascension is one of the year's top political stories. Salem's outreach follows months of condemnations of the candidate by Wall Street's elites like JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, Pershing Square head Bill Ackman, and Third Point hedge fund boss Dan Loeb. Billionaire corporate leaders have been spending big in a last-ditch effort to elect Andrew Cuomo. Since Mamdai's surprise 12-point primary win, Salem said, the business community has been more willing to engage with the candidate. Salem has chatted with more than 70 CEOs, roughly 30 of whom head large corporations, he said. Most conversations have been with the finance, insurance, and real estate industries, but about a third have been with tech CEOs, he said. Ralph Schlosstein, the Democrat chairman emeritus of Evercore and a cofounder of BlackRock, described OneNYC to Business Insider as "a noble effort to bridge the gap" between Mamdani, who is not well known to business leaders, and "those in the business community who are passionate about the success of the city." For his part, it has been reported that Mamdani has been on a charm offensive, meeting with tech executives and New York power brokers, including Dimon and Brooklyn developer Jed Walentas. Mamdani is listening to his critics, Salem said. He announced last week that he would keep on NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch if elected, to the chagrin of his most progressive supporters. This came after a "resounding, resounding recommendation" from business leaders, Salem said. Under rules governing PACs, Salem and OneNYC are not allowed to directly coordinate with the candidate, but he believes that there are more opportunities for partnership ahead. OneNYC is organizing a New York business advisory council that would be willing to advise a potential Mamdani administration, including Milgram and Kevin Ryan, a prolific venture investor of AlleyCorp who helped found Business Insider. Kathy Wylde, CEO of the Partnership for New York City, told Business Insider in an email that Salem is "building the infrastructure" to give business leaders "seats at the table" if Mamdani wins. She said that her nonprofit group, which represents the interests of some of the city's biggest corporations, has connected Salem with "individual leaders to hear their ideas and concerns." If the polls are correct, Salem says CEOs they've invited have "indicated that they're ready to join immediately after the election." Salem, a son of Egyptian immigrants who was raised in Manhattan, said the idea for the PAC came the night of Mamdani's primary landslide, while he was celebrating at the campaign's official watch party. He thought that if an NYU Stern and Harvard Business School graduate could join a bunch of progressive activists, maybe he could find some common ground between New York's business leaders and a Mamdani mayoralty. It was an unlikely revelation for someone whose résumé is packed with corporate strategy experience, not political organization. After a few banking internships, Salem's career took off with consulting powerhouse McKinsey, where he said he helped build infrastructure for the Saudi kingdom's response to the MERS virus in 2014. He also spent a year with Saudi Arabia's nearly $1 trillion Public Investment Fund, one of the world's largest sovereign wealth funds. When Mamdani announced his run in late 2024, Salem was running Hira Ventures, his own small private advisory and investment firm, which built a Brooklyn-based urgent care clinic and a COVID-testing business during the pandemic. As he grew his businesses, he also expanded his network of New York's business and political power players. When Salem first got a call late last year to meet Mamdani through a politically connected friend, he turned it down, he said. He was "in the middle of a deal, very busy." He also saw Mamdani polling at 1% and thought Mamdani "either doesn't know what he's saying isn't achievable, which is a problem, or he knows what he's saying isn't achievable, and that's even a bigger problem." As Mamdani's poll numbers and Instagram followers continued to rise, Salem decided he was judging the campaign like a consultant — expecting a five-year plan with milestones and metrics. But Mamdani wasn't offering a step-by-step blueprint; he was setting a vision. By laying out big goals, such as "an affordable New York for all," Salem said, Mamdani could be creating the energy and momentum to make change possible. When Salem set up OneNYC, he saw a way to get business leaders to "disregard distracting noise," and set out to use his experience. "When you're a seven-year vet at McKinsey, your day-to-day is to talk to CEOs, right?" Salem said. Mamdani's platform — free city buses, a rent freeze, and higher taxes on millionaires — has rattled New York's business elite. Executives warn his tax plan could drive wealth and jobs out of the city, while real-estate leaders say a rent freeze would squeeze landlords and stall repairs. At an event on Wednesday, Home Depot cofounder Ken Langone said: "New York is on the verge of making a monumental mistake." Andrew Milgram, the Marblegate founder who donated $50,000 to a pro-Cuomo PAC before the primary and $50,000 to OneNYC when it launched, was convinced to support Mamdani because of the way his affordability message resonated with New Yorkers, calling him the "messenger of the moment." Milgram said it's obvious Salem "starts with a pretty tall order," but agreed that the idea "that we can generate real change in this city for the benefit of all" has some business leaders willing to think outside the box. Mamdani's loudest critics have threatened that if he wins, the city's tax base will flee. A poll from Victory Insights, a right-leaning polling firm, reported that more than a quarter of New York City residents would consider leaving if Mamdani won. Salem doesn't think that will be the case. "Early on, I heard almost zero about taxes, which I found fascinating," Salem said about his conversations with CEOs. Schlosstein said that many of his peers would be willing to pay more if they felt the difference in quality of life. "A good number of those who are higher income are prepared to pay somewhat higher taxes in order to have a more successful city," Schlosstein said. Salem said that CEOs have highlighted three major concerns: Mamdani's lack of experience, public safety plans, and fears that his housing affordability program would backfire. Salem explained that a potential Tisch appointment showcases that Mamdani will put "capability" over "ideology," helping allay concerns around his lack of experience or his plans for public safety. Some proposals, like free childcare, were easy for business leaders to understand. Others, like free buses, have required his background in advising to help people grasp the idea. Buses were selected because eliminating fares could also speed them up by cutting boarding time. Salem often cites a study by Charles Komanoff, the policy architect of New York's congestion pricing laws, which found that free buses would run 12% faster, cost just $600 million in lost fares, and bring nearly $1.5 billion in economic benefits. Salem says he hasn't embraced socialism but has shed a "purist approach" to capitalism over the last five years, partially driven by price-gouging among his competitors during the COVID-19 pandemic. He tries to get CEOs to see beyond labels and focus on practical differences. "It's like, guys, I am a big fan of Ayn Rand, I've read all of her work," he said. "We have a problem with labels. My position is that as business leaders, you have the added responsibility of distinguishing between labels and the actual meaning of the words." Correction: October 31, 2025 — An earlier version of this story misstated that Saudi Arabia's PIF was the world's largest sovereign wealth fund. Jump to

Lenskart Solutions Ltd. has raised Rs 3,268 crore from anchor investors on Thursday, ahead of its initial public offering. The company allotted 8.13 crore shares at Rs 402 apiece to 147 anchor investors. However, while 22 participated in the anchor allocation, seven refrained from doing it. The IPO which has become a buzzword in the markets, has allotted shares to 21 mutual fund houses and asset management companies. They applied through 59 schemes and collectively netted 35.34% of the anchor portion. New World Fund got the highest allocation of 3.82%. While T. Rowe Price International Discovery Fund got the second highest allotment of 3.11%, SBI Focused Fund got 3.06% stake in the company. SBI, Kotak, ICICI Prudential, HDFC and Axis were among the major fund houses in this category. While 22 mutual fund houses have acquired stake in Lenskart through anchor allocation, there are seven that did not participate. The mutual fund houses include Parag Parikh, Nippon India and Tata Mutual fud. The IPO anchor book had received bids worth Rs 68,000 crore on Wednesday, which was one day ahead of the public issue's opening for subscription, according to sources. This was nearly 10 times the issue size of about Rs 7,300 crore, and 20 times the anchor book size of nearly Rs 3,200 crore. The anchor book reflects a strong interest from foreign institutional investors, who account for 52% of the bids received. BlackRock, GIC, Fidelity, Nomura and Capital International were the leading FIIs participating in the nearly Rs 3,200 crore anchor book. Investors have taken to X their concerns about mutual funds subscribing to the IPO with its soaring valuations.

Tokenization is surging as analysts predict significant capital inflows, offering enticing prospects for retail and institutional investors. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Disclosure: This is a paid article. Readers should conduct further research prior to taking any actions. Learn more › It’s no secret that one of the hottest tickets in crypto right now is the tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs). The market grew from $15.7 billion in January to over $35.5 billion today, making gains during the current bull run and consolidating even when other areas of the market looked weak. It comes as no surprise, therefore, that savvy traders are eyeing the market with a view to profit-making opportunities, seeking the best investments as the year closes out. Whether in finance, commodities, or real estate, there are a number of potential RWAs which merit closer scrutiny. Here we take a look at which real-world assets could lead the pack through 2025 and beyond. Tokenization is on a growing adoption curve as analysts predict capital inflows from retail and institutional investors alike. For anyone seeking to ride the crest of this liquidity wave, there are a number of options worthy of further scrutiny. ConstructKoin (CTK) – ConstructKoin is a newcomer to the field already garnering significant coverage in the trades. Currently in pre-sale on Ethereum, ConstructKoin focuses on property development empowering investors to “become the bank” and earn a yield of between 7-15% through ownership of $CTK tokens. ConstructKoin is currently generating buzz thanks to its loan book funding model which is powered by next-level AI and building information management software. Lending decisions are made in hours rather than weeks, promising accelerated property development with rapid growth potential. Gold (XAUt, PAXG, etc.) – It’s been a great year for gold, soaring against fiat currencies such as the US dollar, British pound and Euro. Gold began the year at just $2,600 per ounce and now rests just shy of $4,000, offering significant upside for anyone with exposure. Thanks to gold’s popularity as an investment commodity, a number of players including Tether (XAUt) and Paxos (PAXG) offer tokenized gold among their portfolio of stablecoins. On October 17, gold prices peaked at an all-time high of over $4,300 before buy momentum eased and charts retraced. The question investors will ask now is whether 2025’s gold rush has finally run out of speed. Ondo Finance (ONDO) – Ondo is one of RWA’s frontrunners, offering tokenized US treasuries and bank demand deposits. From its launch in 2024 to today ONDO has made significant progress, rising from a price of just $0.16 to $0.69. CoinCodex shows the ONDO token is up 330% from inception and now boasts a market capitalization of over $2B. In March of this year ONDO moved $95 million into BlackRock’s tokenized asset fund BUIDL signaling greater institutional involvement in the tokenization sphere, and further bolstering proponents’ claims Ondo is ‘the Blackrock of crypto.’ From the start of 2025 the total volume locked (TVL) in Ondo Finance rose from $612 million to $1.78 billion, suggesting strong fundamentals and sustained interest. While market predictions are a tricky business, global consultancy firm Boston Consulting Group predicts the RWA market will touch $16 trillion by 2030. Expectations vary however. More conservative projections by McKinsey and Citi Group predict the market will reach $4 trillion, while Standard Chartered projects the market will soar to $30 trillion over the same period. Though analysts may quibble on the exact numbers, all agree the upward momentum of the sector is parabolic. The forecasts for tokenization look strong but for investors speculating on which asset class will perform best through the remainder of 2025, a number of key factors will come into play. Gold has performed extremely well this year, boosted by the ongoing US-China trade war, but may already have peaked. Although gold is often viewed as a hedge against inflation, this only applies in periods of highest uncertainty. Unless there are major surprises in store for global trade relations, the best days for goldbugs may already have passed. In the medium term, Ondo Finance looks strong. Key partnerships with TradFi’s heavy hitters such as BlackRock place Ondo on a strong footing, and its growing TVL suggest ONDO token may be underpriced. ConstructKoin ($CTK) stands out as a project offering double-digit yields and exposure to the real estate sector. Its design connects digital assets with a traditionally stable market, making it one to watch closely as the project develops through 2025 and beyond. Disclaimer: This was a sponsored (paid) post.

This growing demand is accelerating vendor partnerships and large-scale deployments across mission-critical environments. Trend: Integration into Consumer Applications: Integration of post-quantum cryptography (PQC) into consumer-facing applications is gaining momentum as companies seek to future-proof user data against quantum-enabled attacks. Beyond VPNs like ExpressVPN, which enhanced its WireGuard protocol with post-quantum encryption, messaging apps, cloud storage platforms, and email services are beginning to adopt PQC algorithms for end-to-end encryption. This ensures secure communications, protects sensitive personal information, and maintains user trust in anticipation of the growing capabilities of quantum computing. Post-quantum Cryptography (PQC) Market in the US In the United States, the post-quantum cryptography (PQC) market is rapidly evolving, fueled by a combination of federal initiatives and private sector investments. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) finalized three PQC algorithms in August 2024, providing a standardized framework for quantum-resistant encryption adoption, while the National Quantum Initiative (NQI) has committed significant funding to accelerate quantum information science research, including PQC development. Complementing these efforts, on August 29, 2023, the Department of Energy’s Advanced Scientific Computing Research (ASCR) program awarded USD 24 million for three collaborative projects in quantum networking, part of the lab-only call for proposals on Scientific Enablers of Scalable Quantum Communications, aimed at developing secure communication infrastructures resistant to quantum-enabled attacks. The private sector is also actively contributing: PsiQuantum raised USD 1 billion in a Series E funding round in September 2025, led by investors including BlackRock and Nvidia’s NVentures, to develop a million-qubit quantum computer integrated with Nvidia chips. Companies like Cloudflare are integrating PQC into cybersecurity offerings, such as its Zero Trust Network Access solution, with plans to expand PQC across all IP protocols by mid-2025. These combined efforts from government programs, research collaborations, and private investments illustrate a proactive PQC market landscape in the US, focused on building quantum-resilient infrastructures and preparing for future cybersecurity challenges. By services, the migration services segment is expected to grow at the highest CAGR during the forecast period. PQC migration services assist organizations in transitioning from legacy encryption to quantum-resistant protocols. These services help enterprises assess their existing cryptographic systems, implement quantum-safe algorithms, and ensure seamless integration across cloud environments, IoT devices, and critical infrastructure. They also provide testing, validation, and monitoring to ensure that new cryptography performs efficiently without disrupting operations. With increasing regulatory pressure, rising cyber threats, and complex hybrid IT ecosystems, migration services enable businesses to future-proof their data security, maintain compliance, and minimize operational disruptions in preparation for the advent of quantum computing. Additionally, they support employee training, policy updates, and ongoing system optimization, ensuring organizations can adapt continuously as quantum technologies evolve and new standards emerge. Inquire Before Buying: https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Enquiry_Before_BuyingNew.asp?id=126986626 By organization size, the large enterprises segment is expected to have the largest market share during the forecast period. Large enterprises are increasingly adopting post-quantum cryptography (PQC) to secure sensitive data, communications, and critical digital infrastructures against the anticipated threats posed by quantum computing. According to a 2025 survey by Keyfactor, nearly 48% of organizations in North America and Europe are unprepared for quantum cybersecurity risks, highlighting the urgency for proactive measures. Many Fortune 500 companies are already piloting or integrating PQC solutions into their operations, particularly in areas such as secure cloud platforms, encrypted databases, and internal communication systems. PQC is being used to safeguard financial transactions, protect intellectual property, and ensure compliance with evolving cybersecurity regulations. Enterprises are also employing hybrid approaches, combining classical encryption with quantum-resistant algorithms like Kyber and Dilithium, to maintain operational continuity while gradually transitioning to full post-quantum security. Consulting partnerships and structured transformation programs are helping large organizations assess their quantum risk, implement encryption upgrades, and train IT teams, demonstrating that PQC adoption in large enterprises is both a strategic security initiative and a key step toward future-proofing critical systems. Opportunity: Advancements in high-performance computing (HPC) architectures Advancements in high-performance computing (HPC) architectures present a significant opportunity in the PQC market, as these systems provide the computational power needed to efficiently implement and test quantum-resistant algorithms. Modern HPC frameworks enable large-scale simulations, accelerate cryptographic computations, and support hybrid classical-quantum models, allowing enterprises to evaluate the performance and scalability of PQC solutions before full deployment. By leveraging HPC, organizations can optimize algorithm efficiency, reduce latency, and ensure robust security for critical applications across finance, healthcare, and cloud services, positioning PQC as a practical and scalable cybersecurity solution, while also opening avenues for collaboration between HPC providers and cybersecurity firms, driving innovation in optimized PQC solutions and fostering faster adoption across industries.

Mastercard’s rumored deal for Zero Hash marks the moment stablecoin settlement leaves the sandbox and enters the payments mainstream. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Mastercard may soon make a significant investment to fully enter the crypto space. According to Reuters, the company is in advanced talks to acquire Zero Hash for roughly $1.5 to $2 billion, a move that, if completed, would fold a regulated crypto-settlement network into one of the world’s largest payment processors. On the surface, it looks like another corporate experiment with digital assets. Underneath, it’s something bigger: an attempt to rebuild the plumbing of money itself around stablecoins, not banks. Zero Hash isn’t a consumer-facing brand but the quiet infrastructure behind several tokenization efforts. Founded in 2017, it’s regulated as a money transmitter across the US, holds a New York BitLicense, and operates under equivalent virtual-asset frameworks in Europe, Canada, and Australia. The firm already processes flows for issuers such as BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, and Republic, enabling their tokenized funds to move value across twenty-two chains and seven major stablecoins. Earlier this year, it raised $104 million at a $1 billion valuation, led by Interactive Brokers, with backing from Morgan Stanley, Apollo, and SoFi. This demonstrates that traditional finance is treating on-chain settlement less like a curiosity and more like a utility. For Mastercard, the attraction is obvious. Its network moves trillions each year but remains tethered to the old calendar of money: weekday clearing, T+1 or T+2 settlement, closed on weekends. Zero Hash runs twenty-four hours a day. Owning it would enable Mastercard to settle card and account-to-account payments in regulated stablecoins, compressing those delays to T+0 while keeping everything within its compliance perimeter. The company has hinted at this direction before, with its “wallets-to-checkouts” stablecoin pilot launched in April 2025, but that was still a sandbox. A purchase would turn it into infrastructure. The timing couldn’t be better. Stablecoins now total more than $300 billion in circulation, with monthly on-chain settlements of around $1.25 trillion, according to a16z’s State of Crypto 2025 report. Most of that volume still flows between exchanges and DeFi protocols; however, a rising share comes from cross-border payouts and fintech wallets, the very niches where card networks have struggled to maintain high margins. Visa has already partnered with Allium to publish stablecoin analytics, Stripe quietly re-enabled USDC settlements, and PayPal is running its own token. Mastercard risks disintermediation unless it controls a comparable rail of its own. Zero Hash also sits at the intersection of two fast-growing markets: stablecoins and tokenized treasuries. Much of the $35 billion now locked in on-chain real-world-asset products, mainly short-term T-bills backing stablecoins, moves through entities like it. That gives Mastercard an entry point not only into consumer payments but also into institutional treasury flows, a part of the market where instant, programmable settlement could replace the slower web of correspondent banks and clearinghouses. The overlap of these two systems, consumer payouts and institutional liquidity, may explain why Mastercard is willing to pay roughly twice Zero Hash’s last valuation. If the deal closes, it would mark the first time a tier-one card network owns a fully regulated stablecoin processor outright. The broader context is a quiet arms race. Visa, Stripe, and even Coinbase are investing in fiat-to-stablecoin bridges to capture future settlement fees. Each knows that whoever runs the compliant, always-on layer between bank accounts and blockchains will effectively own the next generation of payments. Mastercard’s move reframes that race: rather than experiment on the side, it is pulling the rails in-house. There are hurdles. Zero Hash’s licenses will require change-of-control approvals from state regulators, the NYDFS, and European authorities under MiCA. Those sign-offs could take months. And while the US Senate’s stablecoin bill passed earlier this year, it still awaits full enactment. Yet the direction of policy is clear. Both the US and EU frameworks now treat fiat-backed stablecoins as legitimate financial instruments, establishing reserve and disclosure standards that institutional users can accept. That clarity lowers the reputational risk for Mastercard to integrate them directly. The economics are enticing. Even a sliver of global stablecoin flow could generate material revenue if monetized like a network. A 0.75% share of the $12 trillion annualized stablecoin volume would give Mastercard roughly $90 billion of addressable settlement activity. At a blended take-rate of 12-20 basis points, that’s $100 to $180 million in potential yearly revenue, small next to its $25 billion top line but growing far faster than card transactions. And unlike interchange, those fees accrue around data, compliance, and liquidity, not consumer spending. The bigger prize is strategic. As more money lives on-chain, card networks must decide whether to compete with or become the settlement layer. Mastercard appears to have made its choice. Zero Hash offers not just APIs and licenses but a template for how traditional payment giants might survive the shift: by absorbing the crypto infrastructure before it absorbs them.

Title: Do ETFs risk centralizing Solana, and who actually gets the yield?

Hong Kong’s 1.99% fee product and US staked wrappers set up a split: unstaked AUM nudges native rewards higher while stake-through funds risk validator concentration. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Solana spent years building a staking culture in which over two-thirds of the circulating supply is delegated to validators, earning roughly 6% annually from inflation and fees. Non-staking Solana ETFs might just change this dynamic. Now that reflexive on-chain participation faces a new competitor: exchange-traded funds that either cannot or will not stake. Hong Kong’s ChinaAMC Solana ETF began trading on October 27 with an explicit mandate not to stake any of its SOL holdings, while the US already runs three stake-enabled products: the REX-Osprey’s SSK, the Bitwise BSOL, and the Grayscale GSOL. These funds direct their custodian to delegate and distribute rewards net of fees. The split creates a natural experiment: will large pools of non-staking ETF capital drain Solana’s validator economy, or will the yield feedback loop pull liquidity back on-chain? The answer depends on which model scales. Non-staking ETFs impose a pure fee drag; for example, ChinaAMC’s ongoing charges amount to 1.99% in year one, effectively turning what would be a 6% staking yield into a negative 2% tracking difference versus the spot rate. Stake-enabled funds, such as SSK, can deliver a positive carry, passing through roughly 4.8% to 5.1% after accounting for the fund’s 0.75% expense ratio and custodian-validator infrastructure fees. But that convenience comes with a risk of centralization. SSK’s prospectus allows the custodian to choose validators, and the fund also holds stakes in non-US ETPs that themselves delegate large blocks of SOL. If a few custodians direct billions of dollars in delegations, Solana’s consensus power and MEV routing concentrate in the hands of institutional gatekeepers rather than in community choice. Solana’s staking reward model is self-correcting by design. Inflation distributes SOL to all stakers proportionally, so when the staked ratio falls, the same reward pool is split among fewer participants, lifting the per-staker APY. This creates an incentive for capital to flow back on-chain until a new equilibrium is established. The math is straightforward: if circulating supply sits around 592.5 million SOL and the baseline staked ratio is 67%, then $1.5 billion in non-staking ETF AUM (roughly 7.5 million SOL at $200 per token) would shift the staked ratio to about 65.7%. APY scales inversely, rising from 6.06% to roughly 6.18%, a 12-basis-point bump. Push AUM to $5 billion, and the lift reaches 41 basis points, while $10 billion nudges it 88 basis points higher. The implication is that non-staking ETFs don’t gut on-chain yields; they gently raise them. The larger the unstaked pool, the more attractive native staking becomes for anyone who can hold SOL directly and delegate to a validator. That’s a very different dynamic from “ETFs drain staking,” the initial fear when spot products were first proposed. Instead, non-staking funds act as a subsidy to on-chain participants, concentrating rewards among those who continue to stake while institutional capital sits inert in brokerage accounts. Stake-enabled ETFs change the calculus. If funds like SSK delegate their holdings, the staked ratio barely changes, so APYs remain near the baseline. But the validator set receiving those delegations is determined by custodian relationships and fund sponsor policy rather than community signaling or performance metrics. SSK’s design allows it to hold other staked ETPs alongside directly delegated SOL, creating a layered structure where multiple intermediaries, such as fund sponsors, custodians, and ETP issuers, each take a fee slice and decide where stake flows. That’s operationally similar to how Lido concentrates Ethereum staking through a curated set of node operators, but without on-chain governance or the composability of a liquid staking token. Ethereum’s stETH precedent is instructive but inexact. Lido grew Ethereum’s staking participation from low single digits to over 30% of supply by offering liquidity and yield in a single wrapper. At its peak, Lido controlled roughly 32% of staked ETH, raising concerns about centralization that prompted governance efforts to cap and diversify the number of node operators. The share has drifted down to the mid-20s as competitors like Rocket Pool and EigenLayer have offered alternative staking paths. Still, the core lesson holds: liquid, yield-bearing wrappers amplify participation and centralize power unless actively managed to distribute power. Solana’s ETF landscape doesn’t mirror that trajectory. Many products, especially in Asia, are explicitly non-staking, meaning they can’t concentrate validator power even as AUM scales. Those that do stake, like SSK or European products from CoinShares and 21Shares, yield less than native liquid staking tokens. CoinShares’ Physical Staked Solana ETP charges no management fees and delivers a net yield of approximately 3% after deducting validator commissions. At the same time, 21Shares’ ASOL reinvests rewards but charges a 2.5% annual fee, compressing the pass-through. Native LSTs like JitoSOL or Marinade typically deliver 5 to 6% with minimal fee drag and full on-chain composability. The yield gap means staked ETFs appeal primarily to accounts that cannot custody crypto directly, such as retirement plans, registered investment advisors, and regulated institutions, not to users who can stake natively and capture the full reward stream. The real risk is delegation concentration within the subset of funds that stake. If a handful of custodians receive the bulk of institutional delegations, Solana’s validator set tends to skew toward entities with robust compliance infrastructure and US legal footprints. That’s a different security profile than a widely distributed validator set chosen by individual stakers based on performance, decentralization ethos, or MEV-sharing policies. It’s not inherently worse, but it shifts control of block production and transaction ordering, and it makes validator economics more dependent on custodian relationships than on community endorsement. The SEC’s September adoption of generic listing standards lowered the bar for exchanges to list spot crypto ETFs beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. That regulatory shift opens the door for mainstream issuers, such as BlackRock, Fidelity, and VanEck, to file Solana products if they see demand. JPMorgan’s base case projects $1.5 billion in first-year US inflows for SOL ETFs, a fraction of the $20 billion-plus that flowed into spot Bitcoin ETFs in 2024, but still meaningful at roughly 1.3% of Solana’s circulating supply. If most of that capital lands in non-staking funds, native APY ticks up modestly. If stake-enabled products dominate, validator concentration accelerates. Scale beyond the base case becomes interesting. A $5 billion AUM scenario, plausible if Solana’s price rallies and multiple low-fee US issuers join the market, would represent over 4% of supply. If held unstaked, that lifts on-chain APY by 41 basis points, making native staking more attractive and likely pulling some liquidity back on-chain. If staked via ETFs, the validator set receiving those delegations becomes a structural feature of Solana’s consensus, with custodians directing billions in stake based on operational rather than economic signals. Either path redistributes staking income more than it drains total staked SOL, but the composition of who stakes and who earns matters for both security and decentralization. Europe offers a preview. CoinShares and 21Shares have operated large staked Solana ETPs for over a year, demonstrating that institutional staking pass-through is operationally feasible at scale. Those products haven’t led to a collapse in Solana’s staking participation; they’ve simply added a new class of institutional holders who capture yield through regulated wrappers. The US market will likely follow a similar pattern, with the added wrinkle that American custody and compliance requirements may funnel delegations to a narrower set of validators than Europe’s more fragmented ETP landscape. The next phase hinges on three variables. First, which validators receive ETF delegations? SSK’s prospectus allows custodian-directed delegation, and if a few large validators, those with deep compliance infrastructure and US legal presence, capture the bulk of institutional stake. Solana’s validator economics then tilt toward entities that can service ETF custody, rather than those that prioritize maximizing decentralization or community engagement. Tracking public disclosures and on-chain delegation data will reveal whether ETF flows diversify or concentrate. Second, actual AUM run-rate versus the $1.5 billion base case. If Solana’s price rallies or if US retail and institutional demand surprises, the scale question shifts from “does this matter” to “how fast does this reshape the validator set.” Monitoring fund creation data, CME Solana futures open interest for basis trades, and AP hedging flows will provide early signals of ETF traction. Third, governance. Solana’s 2025 SIMD-228 proposal aimed to make inflation dynamic with respect to the staking rate, thereby dampening the APY feedback loop that currently rewards on-chain stakers when ETFs hold SOL that is unstaked. The proposal didn’t pass, but the debate shows the community is actively considering policy that could mute the “fewer stakers, higher APY” mechanic. If a successor lands, the economics of ETF versus native staking change, potentially tilting the equilibrium toward more unstaked holdings if policy smooths out the yield advantage. The broader narrative is less about stETH than about custody and defaults. Liquid staking tokens on Ethereum succeeded because they preserved composability and liquidity while delivering yield. Solana’s ETFs split the atom: non-staking funds offer liquidity without yield, and stake-enabled funds offer yield without composability. The winner depends on who the marginal buyer is. Retirement accounts that can’t custody crypto will take the ETF route, while on-chain users will continue to stake natively to capture full rewards and maintain control over delegation. The question isn’t whether ETFs drain staking, but whether the institutional capital they unlock stays passive or begins steering Solana’s validator economy from the inside.

More Info Previously, we reported that Saudi Arabia is digging in for a "long and shallow" oil price war as it looks to regain market share from rivals like U.S. shale producers and OPEC+ members who have been exceeding their production quotas. This comes after Saudi Arabia made significant production sacrifices to support prices for over three years, which allowed competitors to increase their output. Saudi Arabia has also been hedging its oil price bets by rapidly diversifying its economy away from fossil fuels in recent years, expanding into areas such as artificial intelligence (AI), sports and tourism. Indeed, Saudi Arabia's Minister for Investment Khalid Al Falih has revealed that non-oil activities now drive more than half the country’s GDP, with that percentage growing. And, the battle between Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates for Middle East AI supremacy is quickly heating up. The two countries are not only spending heavily to beef up their AI infrastructure, including building some of the world’s largest data center clusters, but are also forming strategic alliances with U.S. tech giants. Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030 strategy has singled out AI as vital to the country’s economic transformation, with 70% of its goals involving data and AI. Related: Too Much of a Good Thing: Solar Overloads Europe’s Electricity System Saudi Arabian artificial intelligence company Humain has launched a $10 billion venture capital fund called Humain Ventures dedicated to investing in AI startups across the United States, Europe, and Asia. Owned by Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund, the Public Investment Fund (PIF), Humain Ventures is a key part of Saudi Arabia's larger strategy to become a global hub for AI, and a key part of its Vision 2030 plan for economic diversification. Launched earlier in the current year, Humain has already begun deploying capital into AI infrastructure projects. In pursuit of its AI ambitions, Humain also entered into significant partnerships with major U.S. technology companies, including Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) cloud service AWS, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and giant data center REIT Equinix (NASDAQ:EQIX). Back in May, Oracle announced a $14 billion investment in Saudi Arabia's digital cloud and AI infrastructure over 10 years, as part of its commitment to the Kingdom's Vision 2030. This investment will expand the company's cloud and AI presence by building a comprehensive network of data centers, including existing regions in Riyadh and Jeddah and planned expansions in NEOM and Dammam. AWS and Humain have announced a joint $5 billion investment to build an AI zone in the Kingdom. Meanwhile, Equinix has announced plans to build a $1 billion data center in Saudi Arabia to meet surging demand for AI, cloud and enterprise workloads. The UAE has also launched a slew of AI investments. Last year, the Abu Dhabi government launched MGX, a technology investment company specializing in artificial intelligence (AI) and advanced technologies. The fund was founded as a partnership between Abu Dhabi's sovereign wealth fund, Mubadala, and the AI and cloud computing company G42. MGX focuses on AI infrastructure (data centers and connectivity), Semiconductors (chip design and manufacturing) Core AI technologies and applications (software, data, and robotics). At its launch, MGX had a target of managing over $100 billion in assets, making it one of the largest funds in the world dedicated to AI. Since its March 2024 launch, MGX has made several high-profile moves, showcasing its ambition to become a major player in the global AI industry. In September 2024, MGX formed a partnership with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) dubbed the Global AI Infrastructure Investment Partnership (GAIIP) to invest up to $100 billion in AI data centers and energy infrastructure. Nvidia is a key partner of GAIIP, offering its expertise in AI factories and data centers. Meanwhile, Stargate UAE is a massive AI data center cluster in Abu Dhabi, developed in partnership between the Emirati AI firm G42 and US tech giants like OpenAI, Nvidia, Oracle, and Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO). Stargate UAE is the first international deployment of OpenAI's ambitious global AI infrastructure initiative, also named "Stargate". Positioned as a "national infrastructure," Stargate UAE will provide the country with its own powerful and secure AI capabilities as part of the UAE's broader strategy to diversify its economy and reduce reliance on external technology infrastructure. The project's central feature is a 1-gigawatt AI supercomputing cluster, with an initial 200-megawatt phase planned to be operational by 2026. This facility will be equipped with advanced Nvidia hardware to meet the massive computational demands of training and running large AI models. Further, Abu Dhabi has unveiled plans to invest AED 13 billion (equivalent to $3.54 billion) in its Digital Strategy 2025–2027, with the goal of becoming the world's first fully "AI-native" government by 2027. The strategy aims to automate 100% of all government processes and integrate AI into all digital services.

Δ Officials at the country’s largest bank told the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) Thursday (Oct. 30) that JPMorgan had tokenized a private-equity fund on its blockchain platform for the wealthy clients served by its private bank. “For the alternative investments industry, it’s just a matter of time that a blockchain-based solution is going to be adopted,” Anton Pil, head of global alternative investment solutions for JPMorgan’s asset management arm, told the WSJ. “It’s more about simplifying the ecosystem of alternatives and making it, frankly, a little easier to access for most investors.” For example, a tokenized fund allows all parties to share one real-time view of who owns what and who has paid up on their investment promises, the report said. This helps lessen the surprises that come with “capital calls,” or the requests from private fund managers to investors to offer up a portion of the capital they had committed. According to the WSJ, this move comes ahead of JPMorgan’s wider rollout next year of its fund tokenization platform, Kinexys Fund Flow. That platform pulls in data from fund managers, distributors and administrators, creates smart contracts representing fund ownership, and allows for the near-instant exchanging of cash and assets on the blockchain. Advertisement: Scroll to Continue Tokenization, the report said, allows the bank to offer clients a digital representation of the ownership of an asset kept on a blockchain ledger. As the WSJ noted, banks that have expressed a past wariness of cryptocurrencies have nonetheless argued for the potential of blockchain technology. The recent passage of the Genius Act, which established a regulatory framework for stablecoins has ushered in a broader wave of tokenization. Goldman Sachs and Bank of New York Mellon announced a partnership in July to launch digital tokens that confer ownership of money-market funds managed by their asset management operations as well as investment firms like BlackRock and Fidelity. This partnership, PYMNTS wrote, isn’t simply about faster transactions, but rather “about programmable liquidity and a treasury function that increasingly operates in real time.” And it’s happening against a backdrop of pro-crypto regulatory momentum — such as the Clarity Act — and interest from the traditional financial sector and that sector’s largest clients. “Banks are in the state where they are thinking about blockchains as public infrastructure that they need to rely on,” Chainalysis Co-founder and CEO Jonathan Levin said in an interview with PYMNTS CEO Karen Webster published April 7. “Without a federal framework, it is incredibly difficult for financial services firms and international enterprises to really get comfortable.” For all PYMNTS digital transformation coverage, subscribe to the daily Digital Transformation Newsletter.

Title: Why crypto’s red-hot IPO rally risks grinding to a halt

About us Copy link The long list of crypto companies hitting the open market this year may have just added another name. On Wednesday, Consensys, the creator of the crypto wallet MetaMask, selected Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan as underwriters for its upcoming public listing ambitions, Axios reported. Consensys, which was last valued at $7 billion in 2022, would join stablecoin firm Circle, crypto exchange Gemini, and a slew of other crypto companies in entering the public markets this year. “Consensys is constantly exploring opportunities to expand its impact,” a Consensys spokesperson told DL News. They neither denied nor affirmed the reports. Neither investment bank immediately responded to a request for comment. Consensys’ reported move to go public further highlights the wider financial industry’s embrace of digital assets. US President Donald Trump has spent much of his 10 months in office opening the world’s largest economy to digital assets through pro-crypto executive orders, approving landmark stablecoin legislation, and appointing industry-friendly leaders to key agencies. Meanwhile, various Wall Street titans, including BlackRock and Franklin Templeton, have piled into the market with tokenisation offerings and digital dollar products. But given the extensive preparation needed for an initial public offering, during which the company pitches itself to various investment banks, how much longer can the rally really last? “We’ve likely got 12 to 18 months before it tightens as regulatory clarity gives way to new compliance regimes,” Connor Howe, CEO of Enso.Build, told DL News. Howe estimates that Congress has until early next year to pass key market structure legislation before the mid-term elections put a hold on lawmaking. “Consensys is smart to move now, while public markets still reward exposure to crypto infrastructure and speculation,” Howe said. Bryan Trepanier, the founder and president of ODT.inc, suggests the opportunity for a crypto company to go public could last as long as two years. He also points to regulatory uncertainty in the US as a potential cooling factor. But two other key factors are also at play: US monetary policy and continued investor interest in pure-play cryptocurrencies. While the Federal Reserve cut rates on Thursday, the Fed chair Jerome Powell made it clear in his speech that a December cut isn’t a given. “If capital markets tighten or there is a severe correction, underwriting appetite for crypto infrastructure could drop off,” Trepanier told DL News. Likewise, if native tokens find utility beyond simple speculation, investors may turn back to cryptocurrencies rather than stocks. “If next-gen protocols launch tokens with real utility in 2026 and 2027, the equity path could start to look outdated,” added Howe.

Title: JPMorgan Completes First Blockchain-Based Private Fund Transaction Amid Tokenization Push

JPMorgan said Thursday it had debuted a new blockchain-based tool that streamlines distribution and servicing of alternative investment funds as the bank pushes deeper into tokenization. The platform, dubbed Kinexys Fund Flow and developed by the bank's digital asset arm Kinexys by JPMorgan, aims to give fund managers, transfer agents and distributors a shared, real-time view of investor activity while reducing manual reconciliation and cutting delays in capital movement. The first live transaction with the tool involved multiple J.P. Morgan business lines: Asset Management, the Private Bank and Kinexys Digital Assets. Fund administrator Citco also participated. This is the latest step in JPMorgan’s broader push to apply blockchain tech and tokenization for traditional finance, a trend that's gaining traction among major financial institutions. The bank has been an early mover, developing JPM Coin in 2019 and launching its blockchain unit, Onyx, in 2020. That division, now integrated under Kinexys, conducted blockchain-based repo trades, cross-border payments and tokenized asset settlements with partners including BlackRock and Siemens. The bank plans a broader rollout of Kynexis Fund Flow in early next year, according to a press release shared with CoinDesk.

Title: WisdomTree Debuts 14 Tokenized Funds on Plume Network
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/10/30/wisdomtree-launches-14-tokenized-funds-on-plume-network
Time Published: 2025-10-30T15:00:00Z

Asset manager WisdomTree has debuted 14 tokenized funds on Plume, a blockchain designed for real-world asset (RWA) finance, expanding access for institutional investors to regulated on-chain investment products. The funds, available through WisdomTree Connect, include the firm’s Government Money Market Digital Fund and CRDT Private Credit and Alternative Income Fund, allowing investors to hold, transfer, and settle positions directly on Plume’s blockchain network, according to an emailed announcement on Thursday. The listings are part of WisdomTree’s multi-chain strategy to make its regulated products accessible across multiple blockchains. As part of the rollout, Galaxy Digital said it will allocate $10 million to WisdomTree’s Government Money Market Digital Fund, underscoring early institutional participation. “WisdomTree’s tokenized funds exemplify how regulated products can thrive in a compliant, permissionless environment,” Luke Xiao, head of partnerships at Plume, said in Thursday's announcement. Unlike general-purpose blockchains such as Ethereum or Polygon, Plume integrates KYC and AML compliance directly at the protocol level, offering built-in safeguards such as wallet screening and sanctions enforcement. Plume, which recently won registration as a transfer agent with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), claims more than 276,000 RWA holders and about $600 million in tokenized assets, making it the largest blockchain by RWA participants. For WisdomTree, the move extends its onchain footprint beyond Ethereum and Stellar. The company, which manages over $100 billion in traditional assets, has about $650 million in tokenized assets under management. Its digital funds are SEC-registered 1940 Act products, allowing onchain transfers between verified wallets via soulbound NFTs that maintain AML and KYC controls. “By adding Plume, investors gain access to diversified tokenized fund strategies and more efficient settlement, while maintaining compliance standards,” said Maredith Hannon, Head of Business Development for Digital Assets at WisdomTree. The partnership also underscores growing competition among asset managers – alongside Franklin Templeton and BlackRock – to bring regulated investment vehicles onchain, as institutions explore blockchain’s potential to streamline operations and open new channels for distribution and liquidity.

Title: Who backed Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package? Here's how Tesla shareholders voted on CEO's compensation last year

Only six days are left for Tesla's Annual General Meeting and a decision on CEO Elon Musk's $1 trillion compensation package. Last month, the electric vehicle giant's board proposed a groundbreaking compensation package to motivate Musk to stay actively involved with Tesla for the next 10 years, and the shareholders are set to vote on it. However, several critics, including Democratic US state leaders and union officials, have criticised the sizable package and launched a campaign to reject the offer, Reuters reported. The shareholders are scheduled to vote on November 6. Several attempts have been made to prevent earlier record payouts to Musk, such as his $56 billion compensation plan for 2018, which investors reapproved last year despite ongoing legal challenges, it added. Here's a look at Tesla's five largest shareholders, excluding Musk, and how they voted for last year’s ratification of the CEO's 2018 pay package. Investment firm Vanguard has 251,390,681 shares and a stake worth $116 billion in Tesla as of June 30, 2025, according to Nasdaq data. The company owns 7% of Tesla, making it the biggest shareholder after Musk, who holds a 13% share. Last year, Vanguard voted for Musk's pay package despite opposing it for 2018 due to its potential size, Reuters reported. BlackRock, which reportedly has nearly 6% share in Tesla and a more than $95 billion stake, had 205,962,777 shares as of June 30, 2025. In a release last year, BlackRock said the company voted in favour of Musk's pay package. Global financial services company State Street is the third-highest shareholder of Tesla, excluding Elon Musk. The company has a stake worth $52 billion with 113,418,687 shares. State Street reportedly voted against Musk's whopping pay package in 2024, according to an X post by Sawyer Merritt, a Tesla investor. The asset manager had a nearly $29.9 million stake in Tesla and 64,767,993 shares as of June 30, 2025. Geode Capital owns nearly 1.8% stake in Tesla. Last year, the company voted for Musk's compensation. Investment bank JP Morgan Chase has 46,015,610 shares in the EV giant, worth $21.2 billion as of June 30, 2025. With a share of over 1% in Tesla, the bank voted in favour of Musk's pay package, Merritt noted. In September, Tesla's board proposed a $1 trillion compensation plan for CEO Elon Musk. The payout depends on growing the company's market capitalisation from roughly $1.1 trillion to $8.5 trillion and achieving various operational goals and targets, Reuters reported The board plans to award Musk up to 423.7 million performance-based restricted shares, which amounts to roughly 12% of the company's current shares. These will be distributed in 12 equal tranches. It further outlines 12 market capitalisation goals, including $2 trillion mark, then nine increments of $500 billion each, and concluding with two $1 trillion milestones, totalling $8.5 trillion. The EV maker has set 12 operational milestones, such as deploying robotaxis and robots, and increasing profits as measured by adjusted EBITDA. Proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) urged shareholders to vote against the plan. On October 17, ISS expressed concern over Elon Musk's split attention between his five businesses, which include Tesla and others such as Neuralink, SpaceX, the Boring Company, and xAI. Tesla denied ISS claims, with Elon Musk at the company's earnings call saying, “There needs to be enough voting control to give a strong influence, but not so much that I can’t be fired if I go insane.” Catch all the Business News , Corporate news , Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint.

Title: Why JioBlackRock’s quiet launch could shake up India’s investing future

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. Mumbai: When India’s largest company announced a big-bang joint venture (JV) with the world’s biggest asset manager to enter the country’s fast-growing mutual fund industry, it marked the coming together of two titans, and ratcheted up speculation to fever pitch. After all, this was in a sense the corporate equivalent of Sachin Tendulkar teaming up with Lionel Messi. The Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) is not known to play second fiddle in any industry it sets its sights on. And BlackRock, with assets under management of a staggering $11 trillion, is referred to as the third most important economic entity on the planet, behind only the US and China. This is BlackRock’s second innings in the Indian mutual fund arena, after its 10-year JV with DSP ended abruptly in 2018, reportedly after both partners sought full ownership of the business. After receiving all the requisite regulatory approvals by June, JioBlackRock Asset Management Company (AMC), the 50:50 JV between RIL subsidiary Jio Financial Services and BlackRock, commenced operations by launching three cash funds, followed by five index funds in August. The new fund offer (NFO) for its maiden actively managed equity product, a flexicap fund, closed earlier this month. Many industry watchers saw this as an uncharacteristically subdued start for a company with this pedigree. Initial impressions, however, have a tendency to be deceptive. In an interview with Mint, Sid Swaminathan, JioBlackRock AMC’s managing director and chief executive officer (CEO), was unambiguous about the company’s goals: “We want to be among the top five players in the industry over the next five years or so." Swaminathan smiled when asked about market expectations of the AMC making a high-voltage debut along the lines of Jio, which disrupted the telecom market in 2016 by launching zero tariff plans. His response was cautious: “The two are not comparable. These are two very different industries in terms of competition, regulations and customers." JioBlackRock, he said, had a clear cut approach: “First, growing the overall industry. Then bringing in differentiated products, differentiated value propositions and differentiated ways of getting people to access these products." Rather than one major disruption, Swaminathan said, “I would call it a series of micro disruptions. That’s how we have approached it." Whether a single earthquake or a series of tremors, one thing is beyond doubt: it would take something momentous to make a dent in India’s mutual fund market, which currently has 54 companies managing assets worth ₹75 trillion across around 2,000 schemes. It’s a tall task, but that’s where the American partner’s track record comes into the picture. Black boxJioBlackRock’s flexi cap fund marks the India debut of BlackRock’s Systematic Active Equities (SAE) framework. While this may sound awfully like just another marketing buzzword, it portends something much more significant. Systematic Active Equities is BlackRock’s famed quantitative investment unit, which uses advanced computer modelling techniques to construct portfolios. What sets it apart from most traditional quant models is that in addition to financial data, it analyses over 400 alternative data sources such as social media posts, internet searches, satellite imagery and even traffic patterns to squeeze out insights. BlackRock acquired SAE as part of its buyout of Barclays Global Investors in 2009 (the unit actually traces its roots to an investment firm set up by Wells Fargo in 1971). SAE now employs over 200 portfolio managers and researchers, many of whom are PhDs in various subjects, including physics, mathematics, computer science and engineering. The convergence of traditional and unstructured datasets has worked wonders for the SAE unit, which has assets under management of $300 billion across equities, fixed income and alternatives. An astounding 93% of SAE’s assets have outperformed their benchmarks or peer median over the past year, compared to 47% for the Fundamental Equity division, according to BlackRock’s Annual Report for 2024. Over the past three years, 89% of SAE assets have beaten the benchmark, while the figure rises to 93% for the five-year period. The Fundamental Equity division picks stocks using fundamental methods, i.e. human analysts and researchers. This SAE framework, being operated from BlackRock’s US headquarters and localised by the JV’s team in Mumbai, is now being applied to India’s chaotic equity market through the flexicap fund. “It’s a very risk controlled fund, so it will look to protect on the downside and then look to generate consistent alpha over the long term. If we are able to do that consistently over a two- to three-year period, which is what our backtests have shown us, then it is going to give you returns in line with the best ones up there," said Swaminathan, who has served in various leadership roles at BlackRock, including as its head of Index Equity, International, in London, where he oversaw assets worth $1.25 trillion. “And because of the way it is constructed, it looks, feels and behaves very differently to existing funds in the market." Explaining how the SAE framework can offer a competitive advantage, Swaminathan said, “Let’s say you are analyzing banks. You can obviously wait for the quarterly numbers. But you can also get faster information in some cases by looking at credit card swipes, for example. What’s the frequency of swipes, how is it trending compared to the sectoral averages and so on." The SAE framework, being operated from BlackRock’s US headquarters and localised by the JV’s team in Mumbai, is now being applied to India’s chaotic equity market through the flexicap fund. That intelligence, he says, enables one to form a more immediate-term view instead of waiting for the quarterly results. “And if we have a platform that is able to absorb all this data, clean that data and transform it into insights in combination with more traditional data points like valuations, profitability, PE ratio etc., then we believe there’s an opportunity to generate alpha." The other element is scale. A fund manager and his team can read and analyze a limited number of analyst reports, but a machine can read thousands of them. Thanks to artificial intelligence (AI), says Swaminathan, BlackRock is also able to generate things like tone and sentiment much more accurately from those reports. “So, you are no longer limited by human brain power capacity. If a traditional set-up using fund managers and analysts can do in-depth research on say 30-40 stocks, our models can do it for hundreds," he said. So, rather than taking concentrated positions in a handful of stocks, it enables smaller active positions on a larger universe of stocks, “which not only allows you to generate alpha but do it with lower risk". Global vs localThanks to the explosion of data in recent years, combined with the emergence of powerful tools such as artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), quant firms are engaged in an arms race with each other to extract even the tiniest additional insight. However, first-mover advantages dissipate very quickly in this cut-throat space and there’s nothing like a permanent magic wand. This makes it imperative for AMCs not just to keep hunting for new sets of data but also dynamically adjust their weightages and mathematical models in response to rapidly changing market conditions. The question is whether relying on this approach will work in a comparatively opaque market like India. “The good news is that there’s a lot of data being generated in every sector of the economy, so a data-driven approach can provide an edge in stock picking," Dhirendra Kumar, founder and CEO of Value Research, told Mint. “That said, just this cannot be your unique selling proposition. In fact, there are many quant models being used by domestic mutual funds and institutions that incorporate non-traditional datasets as well," he added. “So, BlackRock’s or anyone else’s models will have to prove themselves in the market over a sustained period." Then there is the question of adjusting for local nuances. In the US, for example, BlackRock tracks satellite imagery of car parks outside shopping centres to estimate demand, but that might not be relevant in India. Instead, the AMC uses quick commerce deliveries as one of its data signals. Swaminathan declined to share details about other datasets tracked by JioBlackRock, but said there’s an entire array of data points being collated though not all are relevant from a sector or stock perspective. In the US, BlackRock tracks satellite imagery of car parks outside shopping centres to estimate demand, but that might not be relevant in India. Instead, the AMC uses quick commerce deliveries as one of its data signals. Also making its India debut is Aladdin, BlackRock’s investment management and risk analytics platform. It stands for Asset, Liability, Debt and Derivative Investment Network. Aladdin has an India risk model built exclusively for the JV, which allows JioBlackRock’s fund managers to filter stock selections and assign appropriate weightages to data signals. But more than AI, ML and sophisticated quant models, Swaminathan insists SAE’s secret sauce for success is something else. “The key differentiator is that the technology, data, AI and humans are all integrated. Humans (fund managers and researchers) are involved in every aspect, from the first step of selecting the stock universe to subsequent processes of data analyses and insights," he said. The team, said Swaminathan, has the ability to look at the entire stock recommendation output of the models and filter out companies based on, say, corporate governance issues or other risk factors. “This is what separates SAE from other black box quant models," he emphasized. Last mileIndia’s mutual fund industry has emerged as one of the fastest-growing segments of the country’s financial landscape, with assets under management (AUM) surging more than seven-fold in just over a decade on the back of rising retail participation, mainly through systematic investment plans (SIPs). The industry is also very top-heavy, with 10 AMCs holding around 80% of the total AUM. With an AUM of over ₹11.4 trillion, SBI MF, established in 1987, is the country’s biggest asset manager, followed by ICICI Prudential AMC ( ₹9.5 trillion), HDFC AMC ( ₹8.3 trillion) and Nippon India MF ( ₹6.1 trillion). SBI MF reported a profit after tax (PAT) of ₹2,531 crore in FY25, while ICICI Prudential’s PAT was at ₹2,650 crore and HDFC AMC’s at ₹2,460 crore. On its part, JioBlackRock has racked up over ₹13,000 crore in AUM in barely three months. While that is creditable, the asset manager will be hard put to overtake SBI MF and ICICI Prudential organically the way its telecom cousin eased past Vodafone-Idea and Airtel. A conspicuous ‘micro-disruption’ has been JioBlackRock’s decision to take a digital-only approach and bypass the traditional distributor-led model used by the industry. The cost savings arising out of this, as well as use of Aladdin to construct and manage portfolios, has allowed it to offer the flexicap fund at an expense ratio (annual fee a mutual fund charges to cover its operating costs) of 0.50%, compared to the 0.60%-plus charged for similar direct funds by peers such as Parag Parikh, HDFC and ICICI Prudential. Swaminathan does not rule out physical distribution at some point down the line, but said the focus at the moment is to fully harness the “power of the phone". Bold and beautiful?The opportunity is huge, but so are the challenges. Sonam Srivastava, founder and fund manager at Wright Research PMS, said JioBlackRock’s digital-only approach is a bold experiment in a market where over 70% of mutual fund inflows still come through distributors. View Full Image In India, over 70% of mutual fund inflows are generated through distributors. (istockphoto) But it’s not entirely misplaced. India’s wealth ecosystem has changed sharply in the past five years—demat penetration has crossed 140 million, SIP accounts are rising by 20–25% annually, and over a third of new mutual fund investors are digital-first. This signals that a meaningful segment is now comfortable investing directly through platforms. However, distribution remains the backbone for scale and trust in the mutual fund industry, especially outside metros, where investor education and hand-holding are crucial. “JioBlackRock may find digital distribution efficient for cost control and urban adoption, but for deeper penetration and AUM scale, partnerships with RIAs (registered investment advisers), fintechs, or even traditional distributors might become inevitable," Srivastava added. “The future of distribution in India is hybrid, where digital channels drive discovery and onboarding, while advisors and distributors retain the role of building long-term conviction." It also helps to be part of the Jio family, which houses the country’s largest telecom operator, with 506 million subscribers as of 30 September. “We are already integrated within the Jio Finance app, which has millions of people coming every month to do their finances. We also have a presence in the MyJio app, which has hundreds of millions coming in every month for telco and other needs," said Swaminathan. In addition, the AMC has partnered with digital platforms like Paytm, Groww and Zerodha to distribute products. The early results have apparently been “more than encouraging". “We have over 630,000 investors across the life of this JV—in just a little over three months. But what’s even more encouraging to me is that more than 10% of those are first-time investors," said Swaminathan. “Our customer base already covers some 17,000 PIN codes, which is around 90% of the PIN codes in India. And we have only just begun," he added. We have over 630,000 investors across the life of this JV—in just a little over three months. —Sid Swaminathan Well begun may be half done, but the same does not always hold true for foreign asset managers in India. The list of global titans exiting the domestic mutual fund market is a long and distinguished one, and includes the likes of Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan, Deutsche Bank, and Goldman Sachs. Asked about this, Swaminathan said localised offerings and patience are crucial for success. BlackRock itself is taking a second swing at the Indian market, though Swaminathan insists the dynamics are completely different this time. The current joint venture is not between two asset managers. This is between BlackRock as the asset manager and Jio Financial Services, which brings in a deep understanding of the retail consumer along with digital distribution, he insisted. So, what are its near-term plans? Swaminathan said it would continue to have funds that cater to institutional investors as they are an important base for the AMC. “In retail, we want to have index as well as actively managed offerings," he said. Exchange traded funds and specialized investment funds are in the pipeline. For now, the market will be keenly tracking how JioBlackRock’s funds perform in the crowded space. As the JV’s foreign partner and its marquee peers will attest, it takes more than just a brand name to entice an Indian investor. Key Takeaways JioBlackRock, a JV between the financial services arm of RIL, India’s largest company, and BlackRock, the world’s biggest asset manager, is expected to shake up the MF industry In the three months since launch, JioBlackRock has racked up over ₹13,000 crore in assets under management JioBlackRock’s flexi cap fund marks the India debut of BlackRock’s Systematic Active Equities (SAE) framework SAE is BlackRock’s famed quantitative investment unit, which uses advanced computer modelling techniques to construct portfolios The framework analyses over 400 alternative data sources such as social media posts, internet searches, satellite imagery and even traffic patterns to squeeze out insights Experts say that while a data-driven approach can provide an edge in stock picking, it cannot be an AMC’s unique selling proposition. Some domestic MFs already use quant models that incorporate non-traditional datasets Today, the top 10 AMCs in India account for 80% of the total assets under management. Dislodging them organically won’t be easy JioBlackRock’s flexi cap fund marks the India debut of BlackRock’s Systematic Active Equities (SAE) framework. While this may sound awfully like just another marketing buzzword, it portends something much more significant. Systematic Active Equities is BlackRock’s famed quantitative investment unit, which uses advanced computer modelling techniques to construct portfolios. What sets it apart from most traditional quant models is that in addition to financial data, it analyses over 400 alternative data sources such as social media posts, internet searches, satellite imagery and even traffic patterns to squeeze out insights. BlackRock acquired SAE as part of its buyout of Barclays Global Investors in 2009 (the unit actually traces its roots to an investment firm set up by Wells Fargo in 1971). SAE now employs over 200 portfolio managers and researchers, many of whom are PhDs in various subjects, including physics, mathematics, computer science and engineering. The convergence of traditional and unstructured datasets has worked wonders for the SAE unit, which has assets under management of $300 billion across equities, fixed income and alternatives. An astounding 93% of SAE’s assets have outperformed their benchmarks or peer median over the past year, compared to 47% for the Fundamental Equity division, according to BlackRock’s Annual Report for 2024. Over the past three years, 89% of SAE assets have beaten the benchmark, while the figure rises to 93% for the five-year period. The Fundamental Equity division picks stocks using fundamental methods, i.e. human analysts and researchers. This SAE framework, being operated from BlackRock’s US headquarters and localised by the JV’s team in Mumbai, is now being applied to India’s chaotic equity market through the flexicap fund. “It’s a very risk controlled fund, so it will look to protect on the downside and then look to generate consistent alpha over the long term. If we are able to do that consistently over a two- to three-year period, which is what our backtests have shown us, then it is going to give you returns in line with the best ones up there," said Swaminathan, who has served in various leadership roles at BlackRock, including as its head of Index Equity, International, in London, where he oversaw assets worth $1.25 trillion. “And because of the way it is constructed, it looks, feels and behaves very differently to existing funds in the market." Explaining how the SAE framework can offer a competitive advantage, Swaminathan said, “Let’s say you are analyzing banks. You can obviously wait for the quarterly numbers. But you can also get faster information in some cases by looking at credit card swipes, for example. What’s the frequency of swipes, how is it trending compared to the sectoral averages and so on." That intelligence, he says, enables one to form a more immediate-term view instead of waiting for the quarterly results. “And if we have a platform that is able to absorb all this data, clean that data and transform it into insights in combination with more traditional data points like valuations, profitability, PE ratio etc., then we believe there’s an opportunity to generate alpha." The other element is scale. A fund manager and his team can read and analyze a limited number of analyst reports, but a machine can read thousands of them. Thanks to artificial intelligence (AI), says Swaminathan, BlackRock is also able to generate things like tone and sentiment much more accurately from those reports. “So, you are no longer limited by human brain power capacity. If a traditional set-up using fund managers and analysts can do in-depth research on say 30-40 stocks, our models can do it for hundreds," he said. So, rather than taking concentrated positions in a handful of stocks, it enables smaller active positions on a larger universe of stocks, “which not only allows you to generate alpha but do it with lower risk". Global vs localThanks to the explosion of data in recent years, combined with the emergence of powerful tools such as artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), quant firms are engaged in an arms race with each other to extract even the tiniest additional insight. However, first-mover advantages dissipate very quickly in this cut-throat space and there’s nothing like a permanent magic wand. This makes it imperative for AMCs not just to keep hunting for new sets of data but also dynamically adjust their weightages and mathematical models in response to rapidly changing market conditions. The question is whether relying on this approach will work in a comparatively opaque market like India. “The good news is that there’s a lot of data being generated in every sector of the economy, so a data-driven approach can provide an edge in stock picking," Dhirendra Kumar, founder and CEO of Value Research, told Mint. “That said, just this cannot be your unique selling proposition. In fact, there are many quant models being used by domestic mutual funds and institutions that incorporate non-traditional datasets as well," he added. “So, BlackRock’s or anyone else’s models will have to prove themselves in the market over a sustained period." Then there is the question of adjusting for local nuances. In the US, for example, BlackRock tracks satellite imagery of car parks outside shopping centres to estimate demand, but that might not be relevant in India. Instead, the AMC uses quick commerce deliveries as one of its data signals. Swaminathan declined to share details about other datasets tracked by JioBlackRock, but said there’s an entire array of data points being collated though not all are relevant from a sector or stock perspective. In the US, BlackRock tracks satellite imagery of car parks outside shopping centres to estimate demand, but that might not be relevant in India. Instead, the AMC uses quick commerce deliveries as one of its data signals. Also making its India debut is Aladdin, BlackRock’s investment management and risk analytics platform. It stands for Asset, Liability, Debt and Derivative Investment Network. Aladdin has an India risk model built exclusively for the JV, which allows JioBlackRock’s fund managers to filter stock selections and assign appropriate weightages to data signals. But more than AI, ML and sophisticated quant models, Swaminathan insists SAE’s secret sauce for success is something else. “The key differentiator is that the technology, data, AI and humans are all integrated. Humans (fund managers and researchers) are involved in every aspect, from the first step of selecting the stock universe to subsequent processes of data analyses and insights," he said. The team, said Swaminathan, has the ability to look at the entire stock recommendation output of the models and filter out companies based on, say, corporate governance issues or other risk factors. “This is what separates SAE from other black box quant models," he emphasized. Last mileIndia’s mutual fund industry has emerged as one of the fastest-growing segments of the country’s financial landscape, with assets under management (AUM) surging more than seven-fold in just over a decade on the back of rising retail participation, mainly through systematic investment plans (SIPs). The industry is also very top-heavy, with 10 AMCs holding around 80% of the total AUM. With an AUM of over ₹11.4 trillion, SBI MF, established in 1987, is the country’s biggest asset manager, followed by ICICI Prudential AMC ( ₹9.5 trillion), HDFC AMC ( ₹8.3 trillion) and Nippon India MF ( ₹6.1 trillion). SBI MF reported a profit after tax (PAT) of ₹2,531 crore in FY25, while ICICI Prudential’s PAT was at ₹2,650 crore and HDFC AMC’s at ₹2,460 crore. On its part, JioBlackRock has racked up over ₹13,000 crore in AUM in barely three months. While that is creditable, the asset manager will be hard put to overtake SBI MF and ICICI Prudential organically the way its telecom cousin eased past Vodafone-Idea and Airtel. A conspicuous ‘micro-disruption’ has been JioBlackRock’s decision to take a digital-only approach and bypass the traditional distributor-led model used by the industry. The cost savings arising out of this, as well as use of Aladdin to construct and manage portfolios, has allowed it to offer the flexicap fund at an expense ratio (annual fee a mutual fund charges to cover its operating costs) of 0.50%, compared to the 0.60%-plus charged for similar direct funds by peers such as Parag Parikh, HDFC and ICICI Prudential. Swaminathan does not rule out physical distribution at some point down the line, but said the focus at the moment is to fully harness the “power of the phone". Bold and beautiful?The opportunity is huge, but so are the challenges. Sonam Srivastava, founder and fund manager at Wright Research PMS, said JioBlackRock’s digital-only approach is a bold experiment in a market where over 70% of mutual fund inflows still come through distributors.

Swaminathan said it would continue to have funds that cater to institutional investors as they are an important base for the AMC. “In retail, we want to have index as well as actively managed offerings," he said. Exchange traded funds and specialized investment funds are in the pipeline. For now, the market will be keenly tracking how JioBlackRock’s funds perform in the crowded space. As the JV’s foreign partner and its marquee peers will attest, it takes more than just a brand name to entice an Indian investor.

Title: Morgan Stanley Buys Equity Trading Platform in Private Investment Push

The investment bank has acquired EquityZen, giving Morgan Stanley clients greater access to private company investments. Lilly Riddle lilly@thedailyupside.com Democratization is the word on the street in private markets, and Morgan Stanley knows it. The investment bank has bought EquityZen, a company that lets investors buy and sell stakes in private companies. EquityZen bills itself as a way for investors looking to get into private assets to get in contact with equity shareholders of private companies. The deal will enable Morgan Stanley advisors to offer clients private investment opportunities in companies that aren’t available anywhere else. “Companies are staying private longer and longer,” EquityZen CEO Atish Davda said in an interview with Yahoo Finance. “The number of publicly listed companies continues to be at an all-time low, and so if you’re an investor only investing in public stocks, you’re missing out on where more value creation could be occurring.” It’s all part of a private markets trend that is seemingly taking over wealth management. In 2019, Morgan Stanley acquired Solium Capital, a Canadian software-as-a-service platform, and rebranded it as Shareworks; it has been used by private companies since 2021 as an equity compensation platform. Shareworks is part of Morgan Stanley at Work, which offers both public and private companies’ employees retirement plans, financial education tools and other services. The deal will increase their access to private shares and give Morgan Stanley at Work participants more liquidity options, according to a release. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. “[Morgan Stanley has] been servicing private companies for a very long time,” Davda said. “The piece that’s been missing is the piece that connects all of that supply to the demand side.” More Privates Please. The deal is also representative of the broader goal of democratizing access to private investments across wealth management. Last year, BlackRock folded in data on some 200,000 private investments in a $3.2 billion deal with UK-based data and analytics firm Preqin, and demand for the asset class has been rising. Part of the allure is accessing the more than 95,000 private companies that have annual revenues of over $100 million, compared to the roughly 10,000 publicly listed ones, according to research from Russell Investments. That works out to an additional $56 per retirement payment, bringing the average monthly benefit to more than $2,000. Private equity, private credit and real assets — such as real estate and infrastructure — all serve different purposes in client portfolios. As mega RIAs get bigger, some advisors are saying that the independent channel is beginning to look a lot like Wall Street. Florida-based Hinck Private Wealth Management is the latest formerly Commonwealth team to join Osaic’s growing network of RIAs. Women’s average spending on art and antiques was 46% higher than men in 2024, according to UBS data. SIFMA called the current regulations burdensome, costly and unnecessary. Sub-acquisitions made up 31% of all RIA M&A activity in 2025 amid rampant private equity investment in the industry. Private equity and venture funds now account for roughly 12% of investments in the US. Pretty much all of Wall Street reported another quarter of stellar earnings this week. As others have sought 3x leveraged ETFs, VolatilityShares is going further, raising the question of what the SEC’s leverage limit could be. Shah will remain with the company until the end of the year in an advisory capacity.

Title: Tokenized Credit Fund: BNY Mellon Expands into CLOs
URL: https://beincrypto.com/tokenized-credit-fund-bny-mellon-expands-into-clos/
Time Published: 2025-10-30T08:04:02Z
Full Content:
Written byShigeki Mori Edited byOihyun Kim BNY Mellon is expanding its blockchain-based asset tokenization strategy by launching a collateralized loan obligation fund. This marks the latest step in the custody bank’s measured approach to bringing traditional financial products on-chain. The Securitize Tokenized AAA CLO Fund, announced on Wednesday, will provide institutional investors access to AAA-rated floating-rate collateralized loan obligations on the Ethereum network. BNY will serve as custodian while its subsidiary, Insight Investment, handles portfolio management. BNY Mellon’s approach reflects a deliberate sequencing strategy adopted by several large financial institutions entering the tokenization space. The bank partnered with Goldman Sachs three months ago to launch tokenized money market funds on Goldman’s Digital Asset Platform. This enabled institutional clients to hold blockchain-based representations of fund shares from BlackRock, Fidelity, and other asset managers. The move revealed a methodical progression from simpler to more complex instruments. Securitize announced the launch as “the first tokenized fund focused on AAA-rated CLOs, bringing institutional-grade structured credit onchain.” 6/ With over $1 trillion in global CLO issuance, this fund represents a new way for institutional credit to move onchain, reducing onboarding friction while enabling faster, programmable access. Money market funds represent a relatively straightforward tokenization use case. Their underlying assets are liquid, standardized, and subject to well-established regulatory frameworks, making them a logical entry point for institutions testing blockchain infrastructure. Collateralized loan obligations present additional complexity. CLOs bundle corporate loans into tranches with varying risk profiles. They require sophisticated monitoring of loan performance, cash flow structures, and credit quality metrics. The $1.3 trillion global CLO market involves multiple parties, including originators, servicers, trustees, and rating agencies. Each requires coordination and data access. By moving from money market funds to CLOs, BNY demonstrates confidence in managing more intricate tokenized structures. The bank maintains institutional custody and compliance standards expected by regulators and investors. Traditional financial institutions face distinct challenges when implementing blockchain technology compared to crypto-native firms. Legacy systems must integrate with new infrastructure. Regulatory frameworks designed for conventional markets must be adapted. Institutional clients require the same security standards they expect from traditional products. BNY’s structured credit tokenization approach addresses these concerns through controlled expansion. The bank maintains traditional recordkeeping systems alongside blockchain-based tokens, ensuring continuity if technical issues arise. Custody arrangements remain under established legal frameworks, providing institutional investors with familiar protections. Settlement occurs through permissioned networks rather than fully public blockchains, allowing for oversight and intervention if necessary. This approach allows banks to capture efficiency benefits—faster settlement, reduced reconciliation costs, and programmable features—while maintaining risk controls. Smart contracts can automate cash flows and corporate actions, but ultimate authority remains with regulated custodians. The model contrasts with rapid experimentation, which is common in decentralized finance. Protocols there launch with minimal barriers but face heightened security and regulatory risks. The CLO fund launch positions BNY within a broader competitive landscape around institutional tokenization. Goldman Sachs plans to eventually spin off its Digital Asset Platform as an industry-owned infrastructure. Citigroup has established itself as a tokenization agent and custodian on Switzerland’s SDX exchange. BlackRock’s tokenized Treasury fund has grown significantly across crypto-linked products. Prominent asset managers and custody banks are converging on similar tokenized credit strategies. They begin with liquid, standardized instruments, develop operational expertise, and then expand to more complex products. Carlos Domingo, chief executive of Securitize, which has issued $4.5 billion in tokenized assets, characterized the CLO fund as a step toward making high-quality credit more accessible. The company announced plans to merge with Cantor Equity Partners II at a $1.25 billion valuation this week. The news are out! @Securitize has filed to go public in Nasdaq via a merger with Cantor Equity Partners II lead by @Brandonlutnick at a $1.25B valuation 🦄🦄🦄 Boston Consulting Group and Ripple estimated the tokenized real-world asset market could reach $18.9 trillion by 2033, up from approximately $35 billion currently. However, significant challenges remain, including cross-border regulatory coordination, evolving legal frameworks, and operational risks. These include network congestion and key management security. The measured pace of institutional adoption reflects these realities. Banks pursue targeted use cases where blockchain provides clear advantages while risks remain manageable.

Title: The Duplicity of Land O’ Lakes Cooperative
URL: https://www.counterpunch.org/2025/10/30/the-duplicity-of-land-o-lakes-cooperative/
Time Published: 2025-10-30T05:53:00Z
Full Content:
Image Source: Land O Lakes Co. – Flickr – Public Domain Land O’ Lakes dairy cooperative was founded in 1921 in St. Paul Minnesota by 320 small cooperative creameries. They hoped to improve the quality of butter produced in Minnesota as well as implement better marketing practices thereby improving the profitability of dairy farmers. That’s always been the goal of farmer cooperatives, by working together, groups of small farmers can get better prices for what they sell and pay lower prices for the inputs they have to buy. That was the theory, part of the cooperative thinking that made rural America a better place. Farmer cooperatives were supportive of parity pricing, introduced in Roosevelt’s 1933 Agriculture Adjustment Act– the first Farm Bill, that ensured farmers a fair price. In their early years, cooperatives truly had the best interests of their farmer members at heart. But as some cooperatives grew into national powerhouses and many small local cooperatives went out of business, farmers felt the big cooperatives looked more like corporations than the small cooperative cheese factories or local feed mills that they grew up with, growth seemed more important than the collective good of the farmers. In a recent piece in Time magazine Land O’ Lakes CEO Beth Ford voiced her concern at the continuing loss of farmers, low commodity prices and declining farm income which dropped 25% from 2022 to 2024. Estimates put median farm income for 2025 at -$328. It’s not a new phenomenon, according to USDA data, the average US dairy farm turned a profit twice between 2000 and 2021. She mentions that farmers are getting older, with more farmers over the age of 75 than under the age of 35— no wonder, not many 20 or 30 somethings would take a job knowing they would probably be working for a negative income while slowly loosing their equity. Still, kudos to Beth Ford for at least pointing out some of the problems farmers have always faced, —basically an up and down cycle of good years and bad, with luck, enough good years to keep going, but never enough good years to be consistently profitable. But, there is more to the story of Land O’ Lakes. Most agribusiness CEO’s (while collecting their seven figure salaries) and their well compensated boards of directors, move their business model towards more growth and advise farmers to adopt more “efficient farming practices” meaning a shift to fewer, but larger farms that can afford the capital investments required to stay in business as markets, credit and infrastructure favor growth. So, while lamenting the loss of so many farms and farmers, Land O’ Lakes, through their own business model of consolidation has promoted this trend. “As agricultural markets consolidate, competition lessens, meaning producers and consumers have fewer options”. “Milk producers historically organized into co-ops to counterbalance concentrated power among buyers, but today, the largest co-ops, such as Dairy Farmers of America and Land O’ Lakes, prey off of small-scale producers they’re supposed to protect and strike arrangements with massive milk processors, like Dean Foods, that result in additional wealth transfers from farmers to their own executives”. While farm income has continued to drop, one of Ms. Ford’s solutions, —robust trade, apparently hasn’t raised farm incomes either. The US has promoted liberalized international trade of agricultural commodities for over 50 years, and even more aggressively since the 1996 farm bill that wanted to “get the government out of the marketplace”, yet farmers still can’t make a living and “get big or get out” is accepted as inevitable. Despite their squashing of competition in the domestic dairy sector, Land O’ Lakes has established a “strategic partnership” with the worlds largest dairy exporter, New Zealand based Fonterra. Apparently importing New Zealand cream cheese, non-dairy butter spread etc, will help US dairy farmers? Cooperatives are supposed to work for the best interests of their farmer owners, so it’s also unclear why a CEO and the cooperative board would think that engaging in illegal activities would be in the best interests the cooperative in general, specifically, its farmers. Yet they did, resulting in the price-fixing lawsuits and the ensuing settlements in dairy and in poultry for a total of $297 million. I doubt the farmer owners voted to enter into these scandals, but they paid for them. So, as mentioned, when cooperatives get too big, they often begin to act like a corporation, not a cooperative. Ms. Ford finally notes that “As private equity firms have become financial buyers of farmland, consolidation trends are changing. In Iowa alone, 20 million of its 30 million acres of farmland are set to transition. When farms are owned by firms, not families, communities wither. Contract farming does not plant community roots”. An odd comment for someone who has held a seat on the Board of Directors of BlackRock, an investment firm with considerable holdings in US farmland, agribusiness corporations and recently in Ukrainian farmland. While she stated that she was “honored to join this impactful organization” her resignation a year later, “was not a result of any disagreement with the Company, the Company’s management or the Board”, — so, she was part of their investment strategy and apparently did not disagree with it. Money and power can corrupt and cooperatives, can become that which they sought to oppose. Jim Goodman is a dairy farmer from Wonewoc, Wisconsin.

Stablecoin leader Circle, the issuer of USDC, has officially launched its Arc testnet with VISA, Mastercard and other major partners, a new Layer-1 blockchain designed to serve as the “economic operating system for the internet.” Related Reading: Solana Price Set For Double-Digit Rally Above $230: Analyst Reveals How To Spot Next Move The testnet already counts over 100 major participants from finance, technology, and payments, including, as mentioned, Visa, Mastercard, BlackRock, Goldman Sachs, and Coinbase, all collaborating to bridge the gap between TradFi and the on-chain economy. Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire described Arc as purpose-built to connect every local market to the global economy, emphasizing its ability to facilitate lending, capital markets, foreign exchange, and global payments. Arc’s design centers on USDC as the native gas token, offering predictable dollar-based transaction fees and sub-second finality, features that make it uniquely appealing for regulated financial operations. Arc’s debut underscores a growing institutional appetite for blockchain infrastructure that balances regulatory compliance with decentralized programmability. Participants such as Apollo, BNY Mellon, and State Street join payment titans and fintech leaders in testing Arc’s capabilities. Circle has also enlisted developer partners like Alchemy, Chainlink, and Anthropic, while Coinbase and Uniswap are providing liquidity support. The network integrates optional privacy controls to ensure compliance with data-protection standards while enabling transparency for audits and settlements. This balance is crucial for large financial institutions exploring tokenized assets, real-time settlements, and programmable payments. In a significant regional development, South Korean firm BDACS announced it will issue its Korean won-backed stablecoin (KRW1) on Circle’s Arc blockchain, a move aimed at expanding South Korea’s regulated stablecoin presence on the global stage. While Circle currently oversees Arc’s testnet operations, the company plans to transition toward community-governed decentralization in the future. Compliance partners like Elliptic are already integrating monitoring tools to strengthen transparency across the ecosystem. Industry analysts view Arc as Circle’s most ambitious project yet, a move that could reshape how banks, fintechs, and enterprises conduct cross-border payments and tokenized finance.

October 29, 2025 23:00 ET | Source: Aqua Labs Investment LLC Aqua Labs Investment LLC With $20 Million Global Startup Program And Summit Leadership in Dubai DUBAI, United Arab Emirates, Oct. 30, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Aqua Labs, the emerging UAE-based Web3 investment group, has reinforced its commitment to the nation’s Economic Vision 2030 through its leadership role at the Vision 2030: Global Digital Economy and Brand Excellence Summit. The event was held from 23 to 28 October 2025, at Palazzo Versace in Dubai. Organised by MOVA, the next-generation modular blockchain for global payments, and Minax, the real-world asset (RWA) platform, the summit celebrated the convergence of technology, art, and enterprise in driving the next phase of global economic transformation. The event convened senior representatives from the UAE Ministry of Economy & Tourism, the World Bank, the Private Office of His Highness Sheikh Hamdan Bin Ahmed Al Maktoum, Bithumb and Palm Promax Investment, alongside leading investors and innovators. Speakers included Dr Peter Knez, former Chief Investment Officer of BlackRock; Dr Sara Al Mashjari; Representatives of the Promotion and Investment Center for Burkina Faso and Partners (CPIB) in the UAE; Board Members of Promax Group; and representatives from the UN headquarters of AACID - ECOSOC UN; Wael Muhalsen, CEO of MOVA; and Bobby Zhou, Founding Partner of Aqua Labs. The participation of Aqua Labs, an innovative new player, at the summit followed the recent launch of its $20 million Startup Support Program. The program was unveiled in October 2025 in Abu Dhabi and invites founders worldwide to apply for funding, mentorship, and access to Web3 infrastructure designed to accelerate real-world adoption of blockchain, AI, and digital finance technologies. The program also underscores Aqua Labs’ nascent mission to empower visionary entrepreneurs and position the UAE as a global launchpad for next-generation innovation. At the summit, Bobby Zhou, Founding Partner of Aqua Labs, said: “We are honored to have supported the Vision 2030: Global Digital Economy & Brand Excellence Summit and to have given the opening address. Vision 2030 is a celebration of the convergence of technology, art, and real-world assets. We brought together visionary leaders, pioneering brands, and innovators with a shared goal: to transform traditional industries through blockchain-powered infrastructure and global asset tokenization. “Too often, when people hear the word ‘blockchain,’ they think of volatility, speculation, or fringe technologies. That perception is outdated. Blockchain represents excellence and virtue, a framework for trust in the digital world. By embracing it, we can reimagine industries, unlock new creative potential, and enable real-world value to flow seamlessly across borders. We are not just imagining the future, we are creating it.” Aqua Labs Investment LLC recently launched in Abu Dhabi as a licensed entity under the Department of Economic Development, serving as the operational arm of the Aqua1 Foundation. Its next-generation mandate is to develop infrastructure for real-world asset tokenization, AI-powered financial systems, and compliant blockchain ecosystems that connect sovereign and institutional capital with digital finance innovation. Through partnerships with sovereign wealth funds, institutional investors, and global technology leaders, Aqua Labs is building a transparent and scalable framework for the next generation of financial systems – one capable of bringing trillions in real-world assets on-chain while fostering liquidity, resilience, and inclusion across markets.

Title: Tether now holds $135B in U.S. debt – Bigger than South Korea!

Tether backs USDT with $135B in Treasuries, becoming a major player in global liquidity markets. It prompted Tether to launch USA₮, a compliant dollar-backed token tailored for U.S. regulations. Yes, but USDC is gaining ground in transaction volume and institutional adoption. The rise of stablecoins is increasingly being felt beyond the digital asset market. Tether’s USDT, the world’s largest stablecoin, now backs its token supply with approximately $135 billion in U.S. Treasury bills, according to recent disclosures. That figure makes Tether the 17th largest U.S. debt holder globally, surpassing countries such as South Korea and nearing Brazil, as noted by Tether’s CEO Paolo Ardoino. The development underscores how dollar-pegged crypto assets have evolved into meaningful participants in global liquidity flows, particularly in the short-term bond market. This comes at a time when the stablecoin market is entering a new regulatory and competitive phase, especially after U.S. President Donald Trump signed the GENIUS Act, establishing a clearer regulatory path for compliant stablecoins in the U.S. market. In response, Tether introduced USA₮, a dollar-backed token specifically designed to meet the new U.S. regulatory requirements. Rival issuer Circle, meanwhile, has been expanding partnerships and infrastructure placements, and overseas players like Japan’s JPYC are also scaling operations to tap into rising global stablecoin demand. At the transaction level, stablecoin usage remains massive. Visa’s on-chain analytics further show that stablecoins facilitated $6.4 trillion in total transfers over the past 30 days. While USDT typically leads market activity, October data illustrate a competitive shift. This is because USDC recorded approximately $669.15 billion in monthly transaction volume, slightly ahead of USDT’s $607.98 billion during the same period. The figures suggest that while USDT still dominates overall market share and circulation, USDC is gaining meaningful traction in payments and institutional pipelines. At the same time, Tether is expanding beyond stablecoins altogether. Tether Data, the company’s technology unit, recently announced the launch of QVAC Genesis I, a 41-billion-token synthetic dataset built to train science- and engineering-focused AI models. Alongside it, the firm introduced QVAC Workbench, an application that allows users to run AI models directly on local devices. However, AMBCrypto’s analysis shows USDT still leads the market with a 79% share in August 2025, but its dominance is slowly slipping as USDC gains ground. While USDC offers stronger transparency and fully liquid reserves overseen by BlackRock, USDT’s mix of assets, ranging from Treasuries to Bitcoin and commodities, raises more debate. However, the 10th October flash de-peg proved that stability isn’t just about reserve composition. This is because USDT briefly traded above $1 while USDC dipped, highlighting that trust in stablecoins now depends as much on real-world performance as the assets backing them.

Riley Moore, R-W.Va. (Samuel Corum/Getty Images) George Caldwell / @GCaldwell_news George Caldwell is a journalism fellow at The Daily Signal. Send an email to George. Members of Congress come from all walks of life, but a number of those lawmakers have backgrounds as state financial officers—auditors and treasurers, who determine how states invest and employ their funds. Some prominent Republicans say that background of conservative money management has made them uniquely motivated to curtail Congress’ spending. On Wednesday, the State Financial Officers Foundation, a network of conservative state financial officers, gathered for a panel discussion in Washington to discuss how alumni are applying their experience on the state level toward fiscally conservative legislation in Congress. Rep. Riley Moore is a freshman in the House, but is already in a place of prominence as a member of the Appropriations Committee, which makes decisions on federal spending. Moore, a nephew of Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., told The Daily Signal that he draws on his experience as state treasurer of West Virginia in his work. “It was hugely beneficial to me when I was making my case to get on Appropriations. I’m the only freshman Republican or Democrat on Appropriations,” he told The Daily Signal. “Had I not had that state financial officer’s background, I’m not sure I’d be on that committee.” During his tenure as treasurer, Moore pursued pro-natural gas policies, such as divesting state pension funds from BlackRock for its use of environmental, social, and governance criteria in making investments. West Virginia’s economy has historically relied on coal and natural gas. He also worked with state legislators on passing legislation to blacklist financial institutions from doing business with the West Virginia government “if their policies conflicted with or boycotted the energy industry.” In Congress, Moore has left his mark on the ongoing appropriations process in a similar way, introducing an amendment into the House’s financial services funding bill to clamp down on credit-rating agencies using ESG criteria, a policy he says has negatively affected his state’s bond rating. As West Virginia’s State Treasurer, I was the first elected official in America to divest my state’s tax dollars from BlackRock that leveraged ESG policies to destroy the fossil fuel industries of my state.Today, my amendment ensures that rating agencies cannot use ESG to… pic.twitter.com/BgXR4PXLbH His amendment would require the Securities and Exchange Commission to report on which agencies use ESG criteria in order to assist Congress in addressing the negative effects on states’ finances. Moore also comes from a state that, like many others, has a balanced-budget amendment, meaning the state legislature has to make tough decisions on funding each year, and the state treasurer works within the parameters of those budgets. He says that drives him toward a fiscally conservative approach. “At a state level, obviously we’re always doing more with less. That’s what we do. Right here [in Washington], it’s kind of the opposite,” he said. “I think being able to bring that perspective to the appropriation process is certainly something that’s beneficial, not just to the committee, but I think the country as a whole.” Rep. Jimmy Patronis similarly said it has been a culture shock coming from Florida, which has a balanced-budget amendment, to Congress, which has not passed a balanced budget in a quarter of a century. Patronis was the chief financial officer of Florida before being elected to Congress in a special election to fill the seat vacated by former Rep. Matt Gaetz. “The states have been able to be more disciplined, but it’s taken constitutional amendments in those states in order to force some of those policies to be the law of the land,” Patronis told The Daily Signal. “Could we do that in Washington? It’s hard. One thing I’ve learned in Washington: People do enjoy spending money, and I come from a background being a small-business person, where I’m always trying to find ways to create profit, not to spend money,” Patronis said, adding: I’m grateful for what I’ve brought up here to Washington, what I’ve learned, and just hopefully, we can find enough like minds where we can move the needle. One of the most prominent alumni of the State Financial Officers Foundation is Rep. Ron Estes. Estes serves on the House Ways and Means Committee, where all bills related to taxation originate. He points to his time as Kansas state treasurer, working with limited resources, as a valuable experience. “I think a lot of what you look at, just from a standpoint of what’s the role of government, you look at small, limited government and being able to provide people the opportunity to do what they want to without government dictating what to do,” Estes told The Daily Signal of his experience as state treasurer. He added, “There are some functions and features that a government should do, but let’s make sure that they’re efficient and effective in terms of how we set up them up, how we make them work, how we make them apply to people.” The State Financial Officers Foundation is led by Marlo Oaks, the Utah state treasurer. Oaks told The Daily Signal that he continues to value the connections between the organization and its alumni on Capitol Hill. “It’s really nice to have folks that have been in this role who understand what we’re doing at the state now at the federal level,” said Oaks. But he added that, despite the important action in Washington, officials on the state level play a major role themselves in determining governance. “They’ve clearly played a very significant role during the Biden administration, pushing back against the whole-of-government approach. That was one of the greatest over-exercisings of power in the history of this country … to push an agenda on this country.” Today, even with President Trump’s victory, leftist elites have their tentacles in every aspect of our government.

The team at Coopers Beach Butchery were the only Northland butchers to take out an overall category prize at this year's Dunninghams Great NZ Sausage Competition. Hand-crafted sausages are smoking past pricey steak as the barbecue go-to this summer – and Northland’s butchers are producing some of the best in the business. The Northern Advocate recently highlighted Omak Meats’ silver medal in the pork category of the 2025 Dunningham’s Great New Zealand Sausage Competition, but has since caught wind that several other Northland butchers also earned top honours. Mangawhai Meat Shop – also known as Klink’s Family Deli – earned two golds for its Free-range Pork and Fennel and Bolognese with Parmesan sausages, and a silver for its Chicken Carbonara. The wins bring the shop’s overall medal tally to 23, including a previous Supreme Award, over the 13 years it’s been entering the national competition. Owner Dan Klink said he was proud that a regional shop with a staff of only five could do so well in a competition that also drew entries from the country’s biggest players. “With over 800 entries from over 110 stores around New Zealand, it’s getting harder and harder to stand out from the rest, but my team and I keep focusing on quality and innovation.” He said sausages were fast becoming the new barbecue staple as meat prices soar. The butchers agreed that beef and lamb prices had increased at least 30% in the past year alone. “People are looking for value, and sausages offer that. They’re more affordable than steak, but when they’re handcrafted like ours, they’re still packed with flavour and quality.” Klink said there might even be a special Christmas snag in the works, possibly incorporating a cranberry and bacon stuffing that the store also sells. Coopers Beach Butchery was the only overall Category Champions in Northland, winning the highest accolade in the pork section – the same category in which Omak Meats won silver. Coopers Beach butcher Gavin Cameron said it was his first time entering the competition since taking ownership of the shop five years ago. However, his winning Blackrock Pork Sausage - named after his previous Auckland business - was the same recipe for which he’d won the Supreme Award back in 2007. “It’s a nod to where we came from and what we’ve built since,” Cameron said. “We’re proud of what we do, and it’s great to see Northland butchers getting the recognition they deserve.” Cameron said the value of a local butcher went far beyond the impersonal experiences of supermarket shopping or a meal kit designed by someone else. “We talk to our customers, we know what they like, and we can help them make the most of what they’re buying,” he said. Butchers could help customers plan a whole meal, still offered cuts supermarkets had long since dropped, and could custom-make products to order. This year was the toughest economically for the industry and for customers, Cameron said. A good sausage was like having a good steak, and at just over $20 kg, the price of two was usually between $5 to $6 - much more affordable than a piece of steak, Cameron said. “And, if the sausage is an award-winning one, handcrafted, you’re going to really taste the difference between it and a massively processed one," he said. Cameron also tied for a bronze medal with Webster Family Butchery in Dargaville, both being recognised for their Roast Lamb and Caramelised Onion recipe. The Dargaville business’s working-owner Kyle Webster, said sausage sales had surged since he reopened the butcher shop about four years ago. “Our sausage sales have increased, probably 50% since we started here, because they’re still affordable when steak and lamb are so expensive.” Webster said he was developing a Wild West Kumara sausage – a mix of beef, spices and kumara – which sells out weekly. While it wasn’t a placegetter in this year’s competition, Webster believed he was on to a future winner. “The problem is we’re so busy here making sausages, we don’t get enough time to actually, you know, tweak and test and add – but I’m going to make time next year," he said.
