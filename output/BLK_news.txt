Like wildebeest migrating across the plains of East Africa or monarch butterflies flying thousands of miles south every winter, billionaires are a remarkably predictable breed. The world's nearly 3,000 billionaires follow a familiar annual circuit: cruising between vacation spots on superyachts, jetting to marquee sporting events, and suiting up for the same closed-door business conferences. "Birds of a feather flock together," Doug Gollan, the founder of Private Jet Card Comparison, told Business Insider. Each year, private jets congregate at events like The Masters or Super Bowl, he said. 2026 is no different. There will be the Davos and Sun Valley conferences, the FIFA World Cup, and the Monaco yacht show. In between, some billionaires may attend Art Basel or the Oscars. Here's a look at the 2026 billionaire calendar — and how much it would cost to join them. Business leaders and politicians gather at the World Economic Forum's annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, to kick off their year with policy discussions, networking, and, if time allows, some ski runs. This year's summit, which runs from January 19 to 23, is themed "A Spirit of Dialogue." While speakers have not been announced, regular attendees include BlackRock CEO Larry Fink (a cochair of the WEF), Bridgewater founder Ray Dalio, and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff. Access to the invite-only event can cost tens of thousands of dollars, and most of Davos' luxury hotels, such as the Steigenberger Grandhotel Belvédère and AlpenGold, are closed to the public. Apartment rental rates typically jump during the event, with nearby units commanding at least four figures a night. The surge pricing also applies to food. With most of the restaurants booked up for conference events, you may be left paying $43 for a hot dog. NFL teams are popular toys of the ultrarich: Walmart's Rob Walton has the Broncos, hedge fund manager David Tepper owns the Panthers, Clark Hunt and his siblings control the Chiefs, and so on. These billionaire owners — as well as billionaire fans and friends — flock to the Super Bowl, and this year's game on February 8 in Santa Clara, California, will be no exception. "The Super Bowl is always a draw. It's an excuse to see the best of the best in terms of sports, parties, and entertainment," Elisabeth Brown, client manager at travel and lifestyle concierge company Knightsbridge Circle, told Business Insider. Host committees and travel agencies curate luxury experiences for the wealthiest football fans, which can cost six figures and include chartered jets, five-star accommodations, and access to the field after the game. Throughout the weekend, there are VIP parties featuring celebrity guests and billionaire hosts, like Fanatics CEO Michael Rubin, who's become known for his star-studded annual Super Bowl bash. The most exclusive celebration of them all, though, is in the winning team's locker room. Just ask billionaire Jeffrey Lurie, whose Philadelphia Eagles snagged the trophy last year. As Hollywood and the tech world become increasingly intertwined, the Academy Awards and the various events surrounding it have become a magnet for billionaires. Oprah Winfrey took the stage at last year's ceremony to honor Quincy Jones, and the Vanity Fair Oscars Party drew Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez Bezos — Amazon produced nominee "The Nickel Boys" — as well as Alphabet cofounder Sergey Brin and Skims cofounder Kim Kardashian. Two other billionaires, Jay-Z and Beyoncé, typically throw a rival after-party at Chateau Marmont. This year's Oscars, which will be held on March 15, are likely to draw a similarly monied crowd. Larry Ellison, whose son David Ellison leads the storied movie studio Paramount, may make an appearance, as may billionaires Steven Spielberg, who produced in Best Picture hopeful "Hamnet," and James Cameron, director of "Avatar: Fire and Ash." The Masters Tournament, taking place from April 9 to 12 this year, kicks off the run of major professional golf championships and signals the start of spring for billionaires. Each year, hundreds of private aircraft land at the airports around Augusta. In past years, billionaires like former Nike CEO Phil Knight, hotelier Robert Rowling, and investor Herbert Allen Jr. have had their planes touch down. So has Tiger Woods, the only billionaire winner of The Masters. The tournament's venue, the famously exclusive Augusta National Golf Club in Georgia, counts a number of billionaires among its members. Warren Buffett, Bill Gates, Warren Stephens, David Ziff, and Stanley Druckenmiller have belonged to the club, Bloomberg reported in 2015. It's invite-only, and new members can only join when existing ones leave. The general public can spectate alongside some of the biggest names in business. Tickets for the Masters are available through a lottery system. Every year, the Milken Institute, a think tank founded by billionaire investor Michael Milken, hosts the Milken Global Conference in Los Angeles. Dubbed the Davos of the West Coast, Milken launched the summit in 1998 as a forum for discussions on economic and policy matters. While the program for this year's conference, running from May 3 to 6, has not been announced, last year, Henry Kravis, Bill Ackman, and Jensen Huang were among the billionaire speakers. The event isn't technically invite-only; members of the public can pay $35,000 to support the Institute as a council member and receive complimentary admission. While billionaires tend to spend June in the Hamptons or on yachts crisscrossing the Mediterranean, this year, many are expected to head to arenas across North America for the FIFA World Cup. "The big, big, big thing everybody's talking about and getting tickets for right now is the World Cup," Charlie Garcia, the founder of centimillionaire membership club R360, told Business Insider. The soccer competition, which takes place every four years, starts in June and runs through early July. Tickets for the final at MetLife Stadium start at over $9,000 on the resale market. While the tournament organizes teams by country, many star players are signed to clubs owned by billionaires, including Todd Boehly and Mark Walter's Chelsea, Stan Kroenke's Arsenal, and John Henry's Liverpool. There will likely be at least one billionaire on the field: Cristiano Ronaldo, who is set to play for Portugal. Private jets descend on the small town of Hailey, Idaho, every July for the Allen & Company Sun Valley Conference. Since 1983, boutique investment bank Allen & Co. — its president, Herbert Allen, is a billionaire himself — has hosted the event, which attracts the biggest and richest names in business, such as Jeff Bezos, Sam Altman, Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, and Warren Buffett. The conference has become known for the deals struck in between rounds of golf, guided hikes, and tennis matches. It's where Jeff Bezos snagged The Washington Post for $250 million in 2013 and where the seed for Disney's $19 billion acquisition of ABC was planted in 1995. Last year was no exception. David Ellison, the scion of billionaire Larry Ellison, met with Bari Weiss at the conference to discuss Paramount Skydance's potential purchase of The Free Press, The New York Times reported. In October, the $150 million deal was announced. The vacation-cum-business-meeting is invite-only and pretty much restricted to masters of the universe. Security is strict, with even the press walled off from most of the wheeling and dealing. Burning Man — the anticapitalist art and music festival in the Nevada desert — has been a rite of passage for the tech elite for decades. Google cofounders Sergey Brin and Larry Page are longtime Burners — the festival inspired the very first Google Doodle — as is Eric Schmidt, Google's former CEO. Facebook cofounders Dustin Moskowitz and Mark Zuckerberg, and Uber cofounder Garrett Camp have also attended. Even Ray Dalio, the billionaire hedge fund manager, joined in 2019. Last year's festival, marked by storms in Black Rock City, drew fewer billionaires than in previous years. Still, hundreds of private planes flew into Burning Man's temporary airport during the festival. The starting price to charter a plane through Burner Express Air was $18,000, one way. This year's festival runs from August 30 to September 7, with planning already underway by the Burning Man Project. The coastline of Monte Carlo, already a haven for the ultrawealthy, becomes crowded with superyachts at the end of September for the Monaco Yacht Show, where billionaires scope out their new toys. The 120-plus superyachts on display feature elevators, bars, spas, pools, gyms, hot tubs, and helipads, and were worth a combined $5 billion last year. Jet Skis and submersibles are popular add-ons. Last year's yacht show featured yachts owned by the likes of billionaires Denis O'Brien and Paul Fireman. The largest of them, Mar, is still listed for sale with an asking price of $230 million. In the past, yachts owned by billionaires such as Paul Allen, Steve Wynn, and Sergey Brin have been exhibited at the show. The Monaco Yacht Show is open to the public, with one-day passes starting at about $800. October presents numerous opportunities for the affluent to expand their art collections. First, the Frieze Art Fair and nearby Frieze Masters, held annually in London, focus on contemporary art and pre-21st-century art, respectively. In years past, collectors like Point72's Steve Cohen and Diamond titan Laurence Graff have been spotted there. Shortly after, across the English Channel, is Art Basel Paris, a relatively new addition to the art fair circuit. Last year's fair drew James Murdoch, an investor in Art Basel's parent company, as well as Delphine Arnault, the daughter of Bernard, and billionaire art collector J. Tomilson Hill. A painting by Gerhard Richter marked the fair's biggest sale, fetching $23 million, and several works sold for seven-figure sums. Exactly which moneyed collectors are behind specific purchases tends to be kept under wraps. While the VIP previews, when most billionaires are spotted, are invite-only, anyone can buy tickets to these shows themselves, which begin on October 14 with the Frieze fairs. Formula 1 has become a passion for billionaires over the past couple of decades. The racing business itself is owned by John Malone's Liberty Media, and nearly all of the teams are connected to billionaires through their ownership structures. The various Grand Prix attract these wealthy owners and fans thanks to the races and parties. Monaco maybe a marquee of the F1 calendar, but newer events like the Las Vegas Grand Prix increasingly draw big names. Last year's race drew billionaires, including Beyoncé and Jay-Z, Magic Johnson, Fanatics founder and CEO Michael Rubin, and Aston Martin Team owner Laurence Stroll. Three-day passes for the Sin City heat, which runs from November 19 to 21 this year, started at $400 for general admission last year but rose considerably for various seating and package options. While Aspen and Vail remain billionaire favorites over the holidays, no destination is as popular as St. Barts when it comes to ringing in the new year. Last year, superyachts owned by the likes of David Geffen, Jerry Jones, and Eric Schmidt were moored off the Caribbean island's coast. Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez Bezos were seen partying at a beach club. For those who don't stay on yachts, rooms at popular luxury hotels like Eden Rock and Cheval Blanc, owned by Bernard Arnault's LVMH, cost upward of $7,000 a night. "There is nothing mass-market about it," Winston Chesterfield, the founder of Barton, a consulting firm focused on luxury and the wealthy, told Business Insider. "It's impossible to be there unless you are really wealthy." Jump to

The Bitcoin Spot ETFs have experienced a turbulent start to 2026 after early inflows were wiped out by four consecutive days of withdrawals. Amid Bitcoin’s recent failure to sustain its market recovery above $94,000, institutional investors are seeking more stability, especially considering the falling chances of a possible interest rate cut. According to data from the ETF tracker site, SoSoValue, the Bitcoin ETFs registered $681 million in net outflows in the first full trading week of 2026. Notably, these investment funds had commenced the year on a positive note, notching $697.2 million in net deposits on January 5 after an initial $471.1 million inflow on January 2. However, a combined net outflow of $1.378 billion between January 6-9 soon cleared out all positive momentum driven by the earlier inflows. In analyzing individual ETF performance, Fidelity’s FBTC experienced the largest net redemptions valued at $481.32 million. Following closely was Grayscale’s GBTC, which recorded a net outflow of $171.79 million. Meanwhile, Ark/21Shares’ ARKB also had a sizable contribution to the overall weekly negative performance as its withdrawals exceeded deposits by $45.34 million. Other Bitcoin Spot ETFs with red performances include Grayscale’s BTC, Bitwise’s BITB, and VanEck’s HODL, with net outflows varying between $3 million and $22 million. On the other side of the spectrum, BlackRock’s IBIT recorded the largest net inflow of the week, valued at $25.86 million. The BlackRock flagship crypto ETF continues to dominate with a remarkable cumulative net inflow of $62.41 billion, as its total net assets climb to $69.88 billion. Other ETFs with a positive performance include Invesco’s BTCO, Franklin Templeton’s EZBC, Valkyrie’s BRRR, and WisdomTree’s BTCW, which also attracted net investments between $1 million and $15 million. Meanwhile, Hashdex’s DEFI stood alone as the only ETF with a zero netflow. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin Spot ETFs boast a cumulative total net inflow of $56.40 billion. Meanwhile, their total net assets are valued at $116.86 billion and represents 6.48% of the Bitcoin market cap. Interestingly, the Ethereum Spot ETFs produced a similar weekly performance. Initial net deposits of $282.87 million between January 5 and January 6 were followed by three consecutive days of heavy withdrawals, resulting in a net outflow of $68.57 million. The Ethereum ETFs now hold $18.70 billion in total net assets, representing 5.04% ofthe Ethereum market cap. At the time of writing, Bitcoin exchanges hands at $90,422 as price movement over the last week resulted in a minor 0.17% decline. Meanwhile, Ethereum is valued at $3,088 while its daily trading volume crashes by 63.46%. Featured image from Forbes, chart from Tradingview For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: BlackRock warns crypto’s love affair with AI is over as an energy war with Bitcoin miners begins
URL: https://cryptoslate.com/blackrock-ai-energy-forecast-bitcoin-mining-impact-2026/
Time Published: 2026-01-10T18:10:00Z

For years, Bitcoin mining fought an optics war over energy. Now AI is walking into the same grid, with a very different pitch: jobs, national competitiveness, and always-on demand. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. BlackRock is telling clients to stop looking at artificial intelligence as software and start treating it as energy. In its 2026 Global Outlook, the BlackRock Investment Institute argued that the AI buildout is pushing against physical limits and highlighted electricity as the constraint investors are underpricing. The report’s headline-grabber is its warning that AI-driven data centers could consume as much as 24% of US electricity by 2030, a scale that would reorder everything from utility capex to industrial siting. That kind of forecast lands with an obvious follow-on question in crypto: if grid access becomes the scarce asset, what happens to the industry that built a business model around turning cheap, interruptible power into Bitcoin? In 2025, narratives arrived around the potential synergy of crypto and AI due to the theory that AI agents will want to use crypto for payments over traditional finance. However, a power war may tarnish this relationship going forward. For years, mining has lived in a political argument about energy waste. The industry’s counterargument has always been operational: miners can be the flexible load, switching off when the grid is stressed and soaking up surplus generation when prices collapse. In Texas, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) has explicitly designed programs for “large flexible customers, such as Bitcoin mining facilities,” encouraging curtailment during peak demand. But AI data centers come with a different consumption profile, different contract terms, and a different level of political support. They don't want to power down, ever. They want the baseload. BlackRock’s broader point is that the AI boom is unusually capital-intensive. The firm cites a $5 trillion to $8 trillion range of total capital spending intentions for the AI buildout through 2030, with heavy spending on compute, data centers, and energy infrastructure. What began as a race for chips has quickly become a race for megawatts. There’s wide agreement that data center electricity demand is rising fast, even if analysts debate the ceiling. A Department of Energy announcement tied to the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory’s data center report says data center load growth in the US has tripled over the past decade. Moreover, it is projected to double or triple by 2028. EPRI modeling from 2024 cited by Utility Dive put US data centers at 4.6% to 9.1% of US generation by 2030, depending on AI uptake and efficiency gains. A World Resources Institute explainer, citing a Berkeley Lab study, points to 6.7% to 12% of US electricity consumption by 2030. (wri.org) BlackRock’s “up to 25%” framing sits at the aggressive end of that spectrum, and is meant to be provocative. Yet even the lower-end scenarios would be enough to tighten power markets and harden the grid politics around who gets to plug in first. Reuters reported that utilities and grid operators are already adjusting rate structures and rules as hyperscalers and colocation firms scramble for capacity, especially in hotspots like Texas and Northern Virginia. That’s the environment Bitcoin miners are walking into. They are large, mobile power users, and they're first in line in regions with abundant generation or attractive pricing. Until now, those traits looked like advantages. Bitcoin mining is brutally simple at the physics layer. Specialized computers perform hashing to secure the network, and electricity is the dominant input cost. When power is cheap relative to Bitcoin’s price and network difficulty, miners print cash. When power is expensive, they shut down, relocate, or go bankrupt. That operational flexibility has become the industry’s best talking point as public scrutiny has increased. The US Energy Information Administration estimated crypto mining likely represented about 0.6% to 2.3% of electricity consumption in the US in 2024, a small share in percentage terms but large enough to show up in local politics and grid planning. Texas is the cleanest case study because the state’s competitive power market turns that flexibility into revenue. In a 2023 SEC filing, Riot Platforms said it curtailed power usage by more than 95% during periods of peak demand in August 2023, choosing to forego mining revenue to support ERCOT reliability. CryptoSlate reported that ERCOT paid a miner $31.7 million in energy credits that month to power down during a heat wave, a detail that captures both the value of flexibility and why the politics can get ugly fast. Powering profitability through energy credits, Riot Platforms navigates crypto market downturn. Now put that model next to AI. Training and serving large models need constant power and tight uptime. A hyperscaler signing a long-term lease wants predictable delivery, not voluntary curtailment. If miners are the shock absorber, then AI is the shock creator. And BlackRock’s yearly outlook effectively says that the shock is coming and there's no stopping it. In the mining playbook, “cheap power” means stranded hydro, surplus wind at night, or a friendly industrial tariff. But as data centers scale, cheap power becomes a moving target, because grid access itself becomes the bottleneck. Interconnection queues and transmission delays are the new friction. Even when a region has generation, it may not have the wires, the transformers, or the permitting pathway to deliver it to a new 500-megawatt campus. NERC has warned about reliability threats from rapid load growth tied to AI, data centers, EVs, and electrification colliding with generator retirements and slow buildouts. (Financial Times) That matters for miners because their advantage is speed. They can drop containers on a site, energize, and start hashing faster than a conventional industrial plant can ramp. But if the gating item becomes substation capacity and interconnection approval, then that speed turns into a regulatory contest. When power markets tighten, lawmakers start looking for villains. Mining has often been convenient because it feels optional, even to people who understand nothing about it. In contrast, AI is now being both to the public and to lawmakers as national competitiveness. That asymmetry is what will shape policy. It's easier to impose reporting requirements or additional tariffs on miners than on the data centers the local chamber of commerce is courting. It's also easier to frame mining as a speculative luxury and frame AI as the backbone of defense, productivity, and medicine. If BlackRock is right that AI’s energy footprint will become a macro risk, the political coalition supporting grid investment may widen, but so may the pressure to prioritize “productive” loads. Miners might respond by leaning harder into the flexibility story. A Duke University report cited by Utility Dive argues the existing US grid can handle significant new load if it can be curtailed during stress events, and mining can do that. Many AI workloads, especially inference for consumer products, generally can't. That creates a potential wedge: miners as a controllable load that helps integrate renewables, versus data centers as an inflexible load. This argument is already brewing in policy circles and utility commission hearings. However, whether it wins will depend on local economics and lobbying, not internet debates. There's another adaptation path already underway: pivoting from hashing to hosting. The logic is straightforward. If you already own land, power rights, and a substation, you have what AI developers need most. And if your legacy business is volatile, the prospect of contracted cash flows from compute hosting is tempting. CryptoSlate reported in October that some firms originally focused on Bitcoin mining have been pivoting toward AI infrastructure, with deals tied to cloud and AI workloads, precisely because power access in places like Texas has become valuable. The article’s message is not that every miner will become an AI landlord, but that the industry’s prime asset is shifting from machines to megawatts. With 500MW and 168MW hosting deals inked, miners get financing-friendly dollars while hashrate and fee trajectories determine who captures the upside. This pivot is harder than it sounds. AI data centers require different cooling, different network architecture, and different uptime guarantees. Mining can tolerate interruptions, but many AI customers won't. The cost of retrofitting can be enormous, and the competition includes specialist data center operators with deep relationships and financing advantages. Yet the direction of travel is clear. When power becomes scarce, the highest-value use of a megawatt tends to win. BlackRock’s forecast isn't about Bitcoin specifically, but about the end of cheap abundance. If AI pushes the US toward a world where electricity demand grows fast, and transmission remains slow, any business built on marginal power economics gets squeezed. Of course, miners won't disappear. Bitcoin’s incentive structure is designed to keep hash power online somewhere, and the industry’s mobility means it can chase new energy pockets. But the center of gravity could shift. Regions with surplus generation and friendly policy will likely see miners as a stabilizing industrial load, especially if they can credibly offer curtailment. Regions courting hyperscalers will surely treat miners as a second priority. The likely outcome is a barbell. On one side: miners that integrate with grids, sign structured demand-response agreements, and become part of utility planning. On the other: miners that turn their energy positions into broader compute infrastructure, essentially arbitraging their early arrival in power markets into a new line of business. Either way, the easy era is ending. BlackRock’s warning that AI data centers could swell to an enormous share of US power demand is a reminder that the next phase of digital infrastructure won't be constrained by code, but by the messy physical world of wires, permits, turbines, and heat.

Title: US to secure $800bn in Ukraine reconstruction contracts – The Telegraph
URL: https://www.rt.com/russia/630786-us-ukraine-reconstruction-deal/
Time Published: 2026-01-10T17:04:31Z
Full Content:
Washington and Kiev are preparing to sign an $800 billion agreement to rebuild Ukraine, The Telegraph has reported. The deal is scheduled to be sealed at the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting in Davos later this month, Western sources told the newspaper. The agreement is reportedly structured around the rare earth minerals deal clinched by Ukraine’s Vladimir Zelensky and US President Donald Trump last year. The accord grants Washington preferential access to the resources; however, the security guarantees long sought by Kiev are not included. At the time, Trump promoted the agreement as a way to recover what he described as the massive financial aid provided to Kiev by the previous administration. Earlier this week, he reiterated that a deal on rare earth metals was a condition for the White House to continue its efforts to peacefully resolve the Ukraine conflict. “I said that if we want to move forward, we need rare earth metals,” Trump told Fox News on Thursday. “We want our money back.” Officials told The Telegraph that the “prosperity” plan envisages attracting around $800 billion over ten years through a combination of loans, grants and private-sector investment. The newspaper noted that US envoy Steve Witkoff called the agreement a crucial part of the overall ceasefire package he has been negotiating for the past few months. The top state official reportedly said that the world’s largest investment group, BlackRock, would participate in the program. Trump repeatedly criticized unconditional aid to Kiev in the past, calling Zelensky “the greatest salesman on earth.” Last year, he said his predecessor, Joe Biden, had “fleeced” America by committing $350 billion in military aid to Ukraine. He has since argued that the US is now profiting from the conflict by sending Ukraine weapons which are being paid for by Washington’s European NATO partners. Moscow has repeatedly condemned Western arms deliveries to Kiev, arguing that they prolong the fighting without altering its outcome.

Title: Pro XRP Lawyer John Deaton Slams Warren’s Crypto War as Wall Street Doubles Down on Crypto
URL: https://zycrypto.com/pro-xrp-lawyer-john-deaton-slams-warrens-crypto-war-as-wall-street-doubles-down-on-crypto/
Time Published: 2026-01-10T15:33:34Z
Full Content:
John Deaton has once again slammed anti-crypto senator Elizabeth Warren, saying that she has lost her war on crypto. The pro-XRP lawyer opined that with Wall Street’s major entry into the industry, critics will likely change their stance. Deaton’s remarks come after financial giants, including Morgan Stanley, Charles Schwab, and Vanguard, announced plans to offer their clients exposure to crypto assets. In an X post, Deaton mentioned several financial institutions on Wall Street that are dipping their toes into crypto. These include Charles Schwab, Fidelity, Morgan Stanley, and Vanguard. He said that based on this, even the CEO of JPMorgan Chase, Jamie Dimon, could soon affirm that “crypto is here to stay.” Deaton also suggested that the former chair of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Gary Gensler, might issue a pro-crypto statement soon. “Schwab, Vanguard, Fidelity, Morgan Stanley – even Jamie Dimon says crypto’s here to stay. Someone tell Warren she lost the crypto war and her anti-crypto army has been dismantled. Soon, Gary Gensler will come out saying he was for crypto all along,” he stated. Last year, Deaton launched a Senate bid to unseat Warren in Massachusetts but failed to clinch the seat. Nevertheless, he has maintained his pro-crypto stance and continues to bash Warren, who earlier this year wrote a letter to crypto czar David Sacks, raising concerns about plans for a Bitcoin reserve. Deaton’s optimism regarding crypto adoption in the US follows a wave of interest from top financial institutions. According to the President of ETF Store, Nate Geraci, the surge has proven that crypto is not a scam. In an X post, he stated, “In the next few months, Charles Schwab will offer direct spot crypto trading to clients while Morgan Stanley will launch spot BTC & SOL ETFs… Meanwhile, Vanguard now allows clients to trade spot crypto ETFs. You see what’s happening here yet?” On December 6, Morgan Stanley filed with the SEC to offer Bitcoin and Solana ETFs to its clients. If approved, the investment bank will join BlackRock, Fidelity, and Franklin Templeton, which already offer these products. The filing also comes when more investors are showing interest in ETFs that track the prices of different crypto tokens. Data from SoSoValue shows that BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF recorded $228 million in inflows on December 6, while Solana and XRP ETFs saw inflows of $9 million and $19 million, respectively.

Tokenized RWAs are dominated by Ethereum, but one unexpected blockchain rival just surged 28% to outpace the leader. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Tokenized real-world assets reached $19.72 billion on Jan. 9, the closest the market has come to the $20 billion threshold. That figure measures distributed assets, which are tokens that circulate on-chain and can be transferred between user wallets. As a result, it excludes another $19.78 billion in active private credit loans, which are tracked as represented assets on-chain for recordkeeping but don't enable open transfers. The distributed RWA market splits into three segments. US Treasuries and money market funds dominate, accounting for $8.86 billion in on-chain collateral. Tokenized commodities, led by gold, sit near $4 billion. The remainder, consisting of institutional funds at $2.84 billion, distributed private credit tokens at $2.32 billion, tokenized equities at $801 million, and bonds at $880 million, represents the experimental edge. Here, growth has been explosive, but issuer concentration remains extreme. Stablecoins, measured separately at $307.6 billion, dwarf the entire RWA stack and function as the liquidity rail that tokenized assets plug into. The past 12 months rewrote the trajectory. Treasuries roughly doubled. Institutional funds grew eightfold. Private credit's distributed tokens primarily represent loan participation, while the $19.78 billion in active loans, up 100% from an estimated $9.88 billion in January 2025, reflects the actual lending activity that generates yield. Bitcoin treasury companies need a blend of price stability, strategic governance, and revived leverage demand. Tokenized US Treasuries grew from an estimated $3.95 billion in January 2025 to $8.86 billion by January 2026, a 125% increase. BlackRock's BUIDL fund crossed $2 billion in April 2025, one year after launch, and has distributed $100 million in dividends as of December of the same year. Reallocation by major holders drives BUIDL-I share class drawdown, impacting BlackRock fund's net outflow. Binance accepted BUIDL as collateral in November, and Ethena's USDtb stablecoin now backs 90% of reserves with BUIDL tokens. JPMorgan launched its own tokenized money market fund, MONY, on Ethereum in December, with a $100 million seed. The pattern: institutions are treating tokenized Treasuries as programmable cash. Smart contracts automate interest payments, redemptions happen 24/7, and tokens move peer-to-peer without intermediaries. Against $28 trillion in total outstanding US Treasuries, the tokenized segment remains microscopic, but infrastructure is scaling faster than adoption. Institutional alternative funds grew from roughly $350 million to $2.84 billion, a 714% increase. Centrifuge holds 34.29% market share, Securitize controls 31.02%. That concentration means partnership decisions by a handful of tokenization providers move the entire category. These funds bring private equity, credit, and structured products on-chain with familiar regulatory frameworks. Tokenization reduces friction in secondary trading and allows fractional ownership, while yields remain attractive from 8% to 12%. Additionally, on-chain settlement transparency appeals to institutional compliance teams. The catch: liquidity is issuer-dependent. Most secondary markets rely on redemption mechanisms controlled by fund managers rather than open order books. A 2025 academic analysis found that tokenized assets exhibit low trading volumes despite growing market caps. Until more venues offer compliant secondary trading, institutional funds will scale through issuance rather than true market-making. Tokenized commodities grew from approximately $1.06 billion to nearly $4 billion, driven almost entirely by gold. PAXG and XAUT account for over 80% of commodity activity, as demand spiked 227% as precious metals hit record highs. Tokenized public stocks reached $801.36 million, up from roughly $250 million, a 218% gain. Ondo Finance controls 51.6% by value. Monthly transfer volume hit $2.66 billion despite the modest market cap, indicating high turnover. Active addresses fell 26% over 30 days, suggesting participation is concentrating among fewer, more active traders. Corporate bonds total $193.31 million with 14,300 holders. Cashlink controls 62.49%, JPMorgan holds 25.86%. Non-U.S. government debt stands at $686.66 million, with Spiko accounting for 80.72%. These are proof-of-concept deployments where institutions test infrastructure before committing larger capital pools. Ethereum holds $12.6 billion, equivalent to 64.51% of the distributed RWA market. BNB Chain accounts for $2.02 billion (10.37%), Solana $924.59 million (4.75%), Stellar $829.48 million (4.26%), and Arbitrum $745.92 million (3.83%). Stellar grew 28.% over 30 days, the fastest expansion among major chains, while Solana gained 16.56% and BNB Chain 12.11%. Stablecoins are going mainstream, and Ethereum is positioning itself as the place those dollars ultimately settle. Ethereum's dominance reflects first-mover advantage and institutional familiarity. BlackRock launched BUIDL on Ethereum before expanding to seven other blockchains. Nevertheless, multichain strategies are accelerating. Nearly 70% of BUIDL's assets now sit outside Ethereum, deployed where users and liquidity congregate. Interoperability providers like Wormhole enable seamless cross-chain transfers, which matters when liquidity fragments across networks. Private credit illustrates RWA.xyz's methodological shift in 2025. The platform now distinguishes “distributed” assets, which are tokens that circulate on-chain and can be transferred between user wallets, from “represented” assets, which use blockchain as a recordkeeping layer without enabling open transfer. Private credit's $2.32 billion in distributed value represents the tradable, transferable portion of loan participation tokens. The nearly $20 billion in active loans represents the underlying lending activity tracked on-chain but not freely transferable. The amount in active loans grew from an estimated $9.88 billion in January 2025, representing a 100% gain. Cumulative loan originations totaled $36.29 billion across platforms such as Figure ($14.48B active), Tradable ($2.3B active), and Maple ($1.63B active). Borrowers pay an average APR of 10.14%. Figure dominates with 73% of active loans, operating on the Provenance blockchain. Tradable holds 12% on ZKSync Era, while Maple accounts for 8% across Ethereum, Solana, and Base. The distinction between distributed and represented matters because it reveals how tokenization serves different functions. Distributed private credit tokens allow secondary trading of loan participations, creating liquidity for an otherwise illiquid asset class. Represented assets use blockchain for transparency, reconciliation, and operational efficiency, without exposing loans to open-market trading. Most private credit remains in the “represented” category because lenders prefer controlled distribution over open secondary markets. Standard Chartered CEO Bill Winters stated in late 2025 that the majority of transactions will eventually settle on-chain. Private credit tests that thesis. If loan origination, servicing, and settlement move fully on-chain with distributed tokens, efficiency gains are substantial. However, custody for debt instruments, collateral management, and legal enforceability in insolvency all require more clarity before the market scales beyond its current $2.32 billion distributed footprint. Distributed RWAs could reach $30.8 billion (bear), $41.4 billion (base), or $57.0 billion (bull) by end-2027, assuming annual growth of 25%, 45%, and 70%, respectively. Tokenized Treasuries would scale to $13.8 billion (bear) or $19.9 billion (bull). Private credit's distributed tokens could reach $3.6 billion (bear) or $6.4 billion (bull), while the underlying active loans, measured separately as represented assets, could reach $28.5 billion (bear) or $50.6 billion (bull). The bull case requires specific catalysts: clear pathways for tokenized fund distribution in major jurisdictions, more venues for compliant secondary trading, and deeper integration of Treasuries as collateral across on-chain credit protocols. Private credit's evolution from represented to distributed depends on whether lenders embrace open secondary markets for loan participations or prefer controlled, permissioned transfer mechanisms. Those catalysts are materializing. The UK's FCA signaled a September 2026 crypto licensing gateway. Barclays backed Ubyx for tokenized money infrastructure. Visa and JPMorgan are experimenting with Solana rails. Wyoming’s Frontier launch plus a Wall Street wrapper filing happened fast, and the real institutional bet is on settlement rails. The bear case assumes infrastructure lags and regulatory uncertainty persists. Custody challenges remain central. Traditional custodians are still building capabilities for digital wallets, smart contract governance, and interoperability with tokenization platforms. Four factors determine whether 2027 looks like the base or bull case. First, tokenized Treasuries must become standard collateral across major trading venues and lending platforms. BlackRock's expansion to eight blockchains and integration with Ethena's stablecoin infrastructure is the template. Second, tokenized funds must solve the secondary market problem. Institutional alternative funds are growing eight times faster than other segments, but liquidity remains tied to issuer redemptions. If regulated venues support order-book trading for tokenized fund shares, the segment accelerates. Third, the custody and settlement infrastructure must be professionalized. Institutions allocate to assets they can safely custody and audit clearly. Progress is happening, as Zodia, Copper, and Fireblocks build enterprise-grade solutions, but adoption takes time. Fourth, stablecoin integration must deepen. At nearly $308 billion, stablecoins are the liquidity substrate for RWAs. The GENIUS Act provided clarity, and platforms are embedding stablecoins as settlement rails. China announced it will pay interest on the digital yuan, explicitly targeting dollar stablecoin competition. If US stablecoins remain competitive, RWAs benefit. The $20 billion milestone is a marketing number. What matters is whether the infrastructure supporting that $20 billion can handle $50 billion without breaking. The past year proved that issuance scales fast when institutions commit. The next 18 months will test whether market depth, custody rails, and regulatory frameworks can support the weight.

Investing DIV holds 50 high dividend U.S. stocks and yields over 7% with a focus on low beta names. PFF invests in preferred stocks with over 65% in financials and holds more than $14B in assets. JEPI generates over 8% yield by combining large cap U.S. stocks with options selling strategies. Sending You to Google News in 3 © 24/7 Wall St. For many, investing is about staying in for the long haul, especially if you want to generate a lifetime stream of income that will support you well into retirement. To reach this goal, many savvy investors turn to dividend paying stocks. These are stocks of companies that make regular payments to investors out of their profits. But you can also turn to dividend paying ETFs. These are diversified funds that can hold hundreds of dividend paying stocks hand picked by professionals from big names like JP Morgan and Blackrock. But there are also tons of dividend paying ETFs out there. And their yields vary. Some have low yields, while others have much higher yields. So to narrow down your search, we tracked down 5 dividend ETFs that pay 5%+ yields and can have a nice spot in a long term investor’s portfolio. So let’s take a closer look. Global X SuperDividend U.S. ETF (DIV) is a popular dividend paying ETF among investors. It generates an impressive yield of over 7%. It does this by investing in 50 of the highest dividend paying stocks in the United States. But its fund managers go beyond just picking dividend stocks with high yields. They also screen for stocks with low betas compared to the S&P 500. This can give investors the benefit of low volatility. Moreover, the fund has net assets of over $657 million. And it’s delivered a five year return of around 2%. Plus, it also has a competitive expense ratio of 0.45%. The iShares Preferred and Income Securities ETF (PFF) invests in preferred stocks with an aim to capture returns similar to high yield bonds combined with growth potential. Preferred stocks also generally have higher yields than common stocks, making this fund popular among income seeking investors. This ETF has a large weighting in financial institutions with more than 65 percent of its holdings resting in that sector. But it also has a significant exposure to the industrial and utilities sectors. Utilities are often seen as a defensive sector, meaning it is generally known to remain resilient even in times of market downturns. Moreover, the PFF holds net assets of more than $14 billion. And it has a competitive expense ratio of 0.45%. The Invesco S&P SmallCap High Dividend Low Volatility ETF (XSHD) The XSHD invests in 60 companies in the S&P SmallCap 600 Low Volatility High Dividend Index. These stocks have generally been known to offer high yields as well as experiencing less volatility, potentially making it suitable for low risk investors. This ETF and its corresponding invex are rebalanced and reconstituted semi annually on the last business day in January and July. It generates a high yield of more than 6%. It is largely concentrated in real estate including real estate investment trusts (REITs). These are companies that invest across a variety of income generating real estate like apartments and shopping centers. And it has a slightly lower expense ratio than other funds on this list at 0.30%. Additionally, this ETF holds net assets of around $70 million. The JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF (JEPI) functions a bit differently than other ETFs on this list. It generates income by investing in large cap U.S. stocks and selling options. It generates a yield of more than 8% and has earned a Morningstar Medalist Rating of Silver. Moreover, it screens for stocks with low volatility and uses a proprietary research strategy to find over and undervalued stocks with attractive risk/returnprofiles. The fund is highly concentrated in communications services, consumer discretionary and consumer staples. And its top holdings include some tech giants of the so called Magnificent Seven. In addition, the fund holds net assets of more than $41 billion. And it offers a competitive expense ratio of 0.35%.

Title: New BlackRock report exposes a historic shift in crypto that leaves only one blockchain controlling the settlement layer

Stablecoins are going mainstream, and Ethereum is positioning itself as the place those dollars ultimately settle. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Stablecoins used to be a crypto convenience, a way to park dollars between trades without touching fiat. However, the industry has matured enough that BlackRock now treats them as foundational rails for the market. In its 2026 Global Outlook, the BlackRock Investment Institute argued that stablecoins are widening beyond exchanges and becoming integrated into mainstream payment systems. It also said they could expand in cross-border transfers and day-to-day use in emerging markets. That framing matters because it shifts the question investors ask, especially when it comes from a name as big as BlackRock. The point here isn’t whether stablecoins are good for crypto. The question is whether they’re on track to become a settlement rail that sits beside, and sometimes inside, traditional finance. If they do, which blockchains will end up acting like the base layer for final settlement, collateral, and tokenized cash? BlackRock puts the stakes bluntly. “Stablecoins are no longer niche,” the report quotes Samara Cohen, BlackRock’s global head of market development. They’re “becoming the bridge between traditional finance and digital liquidity.” Stablecoins began thriving on crypto volatility. Markets swing, banks close on weekends, and exchanges rely on a patchwork of fiat rails for redemptions. Dollar-pegged tokens solved that operational problem by giving traders a 24/7 unit of account and settlement asset. BlackRock’s emphasis is that stablecoins have now outgrown that niche. The firm said integration into mainstream payment systems and cross-border payments is a natural next step, especially where latency, fees, and correspondent banking friction remain stubbornly high. One reason the timing feels right is regulatory. In the US, the GENIUS Act was signed into law on July 18, 2025, creating a federal framework for payment stablecoins, including reserve and disclosure requirements. The law is signed, but the real fight starts in rulemaking and phased rollouts through 2026–27. Here’s the timeline, the winners, and how flows could reroute crypto rails. That kind of legal clarity doesn’t guarantee mass adoption. But it changes the risk calculus for banks, large merchants, and payment networks that have to answer to compliance teams and regulators. The market’s scale is also no longer theoretical. Total stablecoin value stood around $298 billion as of Jan. 5, 2026, with USDT and USDC still dominating the stack. BlackRock’s report, using CoinGecko data through Nov. 27, 2025, notes stablecoins hit record highs in market cap even as crypto prices fluctuated. It highlights their role as the system’s primary source of “dollar liquidity and on-chain stability.” That combination of legal recognition and sheer size is why stablecoins have started to show up in places they never used to, like the back office of global payments. Visa offered a concrete example in December 2025. The company said it had launched USDC settlement in the US, allowing issuer and acquirer partners to settle with Visa in Circle’s dollar stablecoin. Visa said initial banking participants settled over Solana. It framed the move as a way to modernize its settlement layer with faster movement of funds, seven-day availability, and resilience across weekends and holidays. Stablecoins are moving into the part of finance that’s usually invisible until it breaks: settlement. If stablecoins are now effectively digital dollars, the next question is where those dollars live as the system scales. As stablecoins move toward more complex uses, such as collateral, treasury management, tokenized money-market funds, and cross-border netting, the base layer matters more than marketing. That layer needs predictable finality, deep liquidity, robust tooling, and a governance and security model institutions can trust for decades, not just a cycle. This is where Ethereum could step in. Ethereum’s value proposition in 2026 isn’t that it’s the cheapest chain for sending a stablecoin. Plenty of networks compete there, and Visa’s Solana pilot is a reminder that high-throughput chains have a seat at the table. The case for Ethereum is that it has become the anchor layer for an ecosystem that treats execution and settlement as separate functions. Ethereum’s own documentation makes that explicit in the context of rollups, where Ethereum acts as the settlement layer that anchors security and provides objective finality if disputes occur on another chain. So when users move fast and cheap on L2s, the base chain still plays referee. The more valuable the activity being settled, the more valuable the referee role becomes. BlackRock’s stablecoin section is also a tokenization story. The report describes stablecoins as a “modest but meaningful step toward a tokenized financial system,” where digital dollars coexist with, and sometimes reshape, traditional channels of intermediation and policy transmission. Tokenization turns that abstract idea into a balance-sheet reality. It means issuing a claim on a real-world asset, such as a Treasury bill fund, on a blockchain. Stablecoins then serve as the cash leg for subscriptions, redemptions, and secondary-market trading. On that front, Ethereum is still the center of gravity. RWA.xyz shows Ethereum hosting about $12.5 billion in tokenized real-world assets, roughly a 65% market share as of Jan. 5, 2026. BlackRock itself helped build that gravitational pull. Its tokenized money-market fund, BUIDL, debuted on Ethereum and later expanded to multiple chains, including Solana and several Ethereum L2s, as tokenized Treasuries became one of the clearest real-world use cases for on-chain finance. Even on a multi-chain footprint, the institutional pattern is telling: start where liquidity, custody integrations, and smart contract standards are most mature, then extend outward as distribution channels develop. JPMorgan has been moving in the same direction. The bank launched a tokenized money-market fund with shares represented by digital tokens on Ethereum. It accepted subscriptions in cash or USDC and tied the push partly to the stablecoin regulatory shift that followed the GENIUS Act. This suggests stablecoins don’t just need a fast network for payments. They also need a credible settlement fabric for tokenized collateral, yield-bearing cash equivalents, and institutional-grade finance. Ethereum has become the default answer to that need, not because it wins every benchmark, but because it has become the settlement court where the most valuable cases are heard. BlackRock’s outlook includes caution embedded in the opportunity. In emerging markets, it notes stablecoins could broaden dollar access while challenging monetary control if domestic currency use declines. That’s a political economy problem, not a tech problem. It’s also the kind that can trigger restrictive policy responses in exactly the places where stablecoins have product-market fit. There are also issuer risks. Stablecoins aren’t all the same, and market structure can turn on trust. S&P Global Ratings downgraded its assessment of Tether’s reserves in November 2025, citing concerns about limited transparency. It was a reminder that the stability of the system can hinge on what sits behind the peg. Despite a downgrade from S&P, Tether's gold and Bitcoin stockpile is seen as strength by crypto markets. Ethereum also isn’t guaranteed to be the only settlement layer that matters. Visa’s USDC settlement work shows large players are willing to route stablecoin settlement over other chains when it fits their operational needs. Circle positions USDC as natively supported across dozens of networks, a strategy that makes stablecoin liquidity portable and reduces dependence on any single chain. But portability cuts both ways. As stablecoins spread, the premium shifts to layers that can provide credible settlement, integration with tokenized assets, and a security model strong enough to persuade institutions they can park real cash and real collateral on-chain without waking up to a governance surprise. That’s why ETH is a likely wager on the settlement standard for tokenized dollars. If stablecoins are becoming what BlackRock says they are, a bridge between traditional finance and digital liquidity, the bridge still needs bedrock. In the current architecture of the crypto market, Ethereum is the bedrock most institutions keep returning to.

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Welcome to Wall Street's AI era. Banks, private equity firms, hedge funds, and asset managers have been eager to use generative AI to boost productivity and reduce grunt work for workers. Business Insider has been reporting on how some of finance's biggest players are approaching artificial intelligence, from its potential impact on jobs and the creation of new ones, to the various ways firms are cutting costs and ramping up efficiencies. But first — if you work at a Wall Street firm and are using AI, we want to hear from you. How is AI really showing up in your day-to-day? Is it living up to the hype? AI is set to reshape roughly 44% of banking work by 2030, according to consulting firm ThoughtLinks — and Wall Street's biggest firms are racing to get there first. JPMorgan Chase, the largest US bank by assets, is spending $18 billion a year on technology, with AI a central focus. CEO Jamie Dimon is a "tremendous" user of the bank's generative AI tools, which have now been rolled out to more than 200,000 employees. The bank is also replacing long-standing human processes with AI. Its asset-management arm announced plans to stop using external proxy advisers for US shareholder voting, instead launching an in-house AI platform, Proxy IQ, which will analyze data from more than 3,000 annual company meetings. Executives have said the bank is training employees to use AI in ways that deliver measurable productivity gains. Goldman Sachs is spending $6 billion on technology this year — a figure CEO David Solomon has said he wishes were higher. In an October memo outlining the latest phase of its OneGS initiative, the bank said AI would drive efficiency, slow hiring, and lead to a "limited reduction" in roles. Goldman has since rolled out internal AI tools, including an assistant now available to employees across the firm. More stories:7 Goldman Sachs insiders explain how the bank's new AI sidekick is helping them crush it at work Goldman is assembling a growing arsenal of AI tools. Here's everything we know about 5. Morgan Stanley, an early OpenAI partner, has focused on turning employee ideas into working AI products. One internally built tool, called DevGen.AI has already saved engineers more than 280,000 hours this year. Among interns, AI adoption is especially strong: 72% say they use ChatGPT daily or several times a week. Citigroup has also accelerated its push. Nearly 180,000 employees across 83 countries now have access to Citi's proprietary AI tools, which have been used almost 7 million times this year. CEO Jane Fraser said the bank's generative AI tools are saving about 100,000 developer hours a week through automated code reviews. Citi also began piloting agentic AI with 5,000 employees in September. Citi snags AI leader from Morgan Stanley to help turn around its wealth tech In the ultracompetitive world of hedge funds, being ahead on the latest technology is always a priority. In December, Citadel said its stockpickers are using an internal chatbot to speed up their processes and find new info at his $71 billion hedge fund. At the 2025 Global Milken conference, Andreas Kreuz, WorldQuant's deputy CIO, said the firm was using AI to expand the data it can bring into its models since it can restructure data from images and audio. Point72's CTO Ilya Gaysinskiy told BI about his big plans to ramp up Point72's tech organization and how AI will play into that expansion. Bridgewater launched a fund driven by AI in 2024. The fund's AIA Labs worked to replicate every stage of the investment process with machine learning. The firm's co-chief investment officer and chief scientist outlined the plans of the world's largest hedge fund. $29 billion hedge fund Balyasny has built an AI bot that it believes will be able to do the grunt work that typically falls to senior analysts — a potential huge timesaver for investment teams. The manager told Business Insider in 2024 that roughly 80% of the firm's staff use its AI tools, which include the internal chatbot BAMChatGPT, and recently hired Matthew Henderey, one of the CIA's AI developers, as a data science executive. Man Group and Viking Global have also developed their own internal offerings. Lucia Soares — Carlyle's chief information officer and head of technology transformation — talked to BI about taking on a new challenge: Bringing AI to the investment giant's 2,300 global employees. Private equity firms are no strangers to managing and analyzing copious amounts of data — but data is only helpful if you can find it. Blackstone has invested in improving its enterprise search and is also betting AI will give it a leg up in its pursuit to capture more of the insurance market. Swedish PE giant EQT built an AI engine called Motherbrain that has changed how its investors source deals. ChatGPT enables the investing giant to take the next step with its AI ambitions. As private equity firms turn to AI for a competitive edge, Thomas H. Lee says its engineers are up to 30% more productive with help from AI coding assistants. AI tools are changing how stock-pickers do their job. AllianceBernstein, BlackRock, and JPMorgan opened up on how their tools are speeding up portfolio manager workflows. BlackRock has introduced Asimov, the agentic AI platform for the firm's fundamental equity business. Business Insider talked to Kirsty Craig, head of research, data, and AI strategy for portfolio management tech, who helped develop the tool. The multi-billion-dollar investment manager VanEck invested in a Toronto-based startup and is onboarding its technology to boost its ETF business. An executive and the fintech's CEO walked us through how AI will change the jobs of analysts and salespeople. Kraken's $1.5 billion acquisition of a retail trading startup made headlines last March. Less noticed was how the crypto exchange used generative AI to run due diligence on the target — a process its head of M&A now considers core to his team's work. At Block, Jack Dorsey's fintech behind Square, Afterpay, and Cash App, engineers built an AI agent that can write code faster — and in some cases better — than senior developers. The company ultimately decided to open-source the tool, even as it gives competitors a look under the hood. Chime has taken a similar in-house approach. In 2023, the neobank built a private, ChatGPT-style assistant to help engineers ship products more quickly and at lower cost. The company's CTO shared how the tool has become a key part of Chime's product-development playbook. Jump to

Title: Abu Dhabi steel group eyes takeover of Gupta's UK empire

Arabian Gulf Steel Industries is among a small number of parties which have approached the Official Receiver about buying the UK's third-biggest steelmaker out of insolvency, Sky News learns. City editor @MarkKleinmanSky Saturday 10 January 2026 09:08, UK A UAE-based steel company has made an approach to buy Britain's third-biggest steel producer, months after it was declared "hopelessly insolvent" and fell into the hands of the Official Receiver. Sky News has learnt that Arabian Gulf Steel Industries (AGSI), which is headquartered in Abu Dhabi, is among a small number of parties which have lodged proposals to take control of the Speciality Steels UK (SSUK) business which until last summer was owned by the metals tycoon Sanjeev Gupta's Liberty Steel empire. The business collapsed into compulsory liquidation in August, sparking a scramble in Whitehall to find a buyer for it as part of efforts to preserve the UK's steelmaking capabilities. The SSUK business operates sites at Rotherham and Stocksbridge in South Yorkshire, and across its operations employed close to 1,500 people when it collapsed last summer. This weekend, it was unclear how advanced any discussions were between AGSI and the Official Receiver, while the terms of any proposal were also unclear. One source suggested that AGSI might be keen to secure financial backing from Britain's National Wealth Fund to support a takeover of SSUK and fund a resumption of steelmaking at its sites in Yorkshire. AGSI describes itself on its website as "the epitome of Net Zero steel", and has pledged to produce five million tons of steel by 2030, while reducing carbon dioxide emissions by more than 95% compared to traditional steelmaking processes. The company is privately owned and run by its founder and chief executive, Asam Hussain. AGSI did not respond to an emailed request for comment, but one source expressed scepticism that it would ultimately acquire the Liberty Speciality Steels business. A number of other parties have also expressed interest in buying the operations in recent months. Mr Gupta himself had secured backing from third parties including Blackrock, the world's biggest asset manager, although the prospect of him being chosen to repurchase the business appears to be extremely remote. An Insolvency Service spokesperson said: "We can confirm that the Official Receiver continues to progress bids for the sale of Speciality Steel UK. "The sales process is ongoing, with the aim to complete a sale at the earliest opportunity." In response to an enquiry from Sky News, a government spokesperson said: "We remain committed to a bright and sustainable future for steelmaking and steelmaking jobs in the UK. "The independent Official Receiver is carrying out his duties as liquidator, while we also make sure staff and local communities are supported." The National Wealth Fund failed to respond to an enquiry from Sky News. The sale process for SSUK comes during a period of broader uncertainty for the British steel sector, against the backdrop of US President Donald Trump's tariffs regime and a continued global glut of the metal. In November, Sky News revealed that ministers were drafting in bankers at Evercore to conduct a review of options for the industry. Peter Kyle, the business secretary, and UK Government Investments (UKGI), the Whitehall agency which manages taxpayers' interests in a range of companies, including the Post Office and Channel 4, are expected to consider whether to merge some of the remaining companies in the sector. These would include British Steel, the Scunthorpe-based producer which is legally owned by China's Jingye Group but which was seized by the government last April amid a threat to close its remaining blast furnaces. So far, the government has spent hundreds of millions of pounds on running British Steel. The government's move prevented the immediate loss of more than 3,000 jobs, although there remain questions about the company's viability as a standalone entity. "We continue to work with Jingye to find a pragmatic, realistic solution for the future of British Steel," Chris McDonald, the industry minister, said in a statement to parliament in November. "Our long-term aspiration for the company will require co-investment with the private sector to enable modernisation and decarbonisation, safeguard taxpayers' money and retain steelmaking in Scunthorpe." In 2024, ministers agreed to provide £500m in grant funding to Tata Steel, the Indian company, to install an electric arc furnace at its Port Talbot steelworks in Wales. The new facility is expected to be operational in 2027, but has been bitterly opposed by trade unions infuriated that the new funding was effectively used to drive through thousands of redundancies at the plant.

Title: Teens share their views on possible social media ban

Sinéad Courtney One month ago, Australia implemented a world-first social media ban for those under the age of 16 in a bid to protect young people from harmful content. The move sparked conversation around the world with many countries, including Ireland and other EU member states, now examining whether they should follow suit. At the Stripe Young Scientist and Technology Exhibition in Dublin (YSTE), we spoke to teenagers from around the country about their views on whether Ireland should adopt similar social media legislation. "It probably would be a good idea, but I'm not sure how many people would be happy about it," Ewan Coulter, aged 16, from Castletroy College in Limerick said. "They’d probably struggle a bit at the start but after that it’d be fine, after the first few months" 16-year-old Ellen O’Shea from Ursuline College in Blackrock in Dublin thinks an all-out ban is drastic. "Instead of banning it, there should be better mediation of it," she explained. "I would make some content harder to access for younger children. I believe that sometimes through media, kids can be exposed to things they don’t need to be exposed, so I do see the point in it (a ban) slightly." Ellen said social media has been a valuable tool for her when it comes to education and preparing for YSTE. "Things like developing projects, schoolwork and all that, social media has really helped me, I wouldn’t be where I am today without it," she added. As a 15-year-old, Éabha McSorley from Gaelcholáiste Charraig Uí Leighin in Cork would no longer be able to use social media if a ban came in. "I think it would be a good idea. It could have positive benefits for people's mental health," she said. But Éabha would prefer to see platforms take more action to remove harmful content altogether as "then it would be a lot safer for children and teenagers to be online in the first place". Explained: Australia's social media ban for under-16s Barry Wilmot, aged 16, from Villiers School in Limerick does not believe a ban would actually stop under-16s from accessing social media. "I don’t think it would make much of a difference, especially if they were already using it prior to a ban, because there’s so many ways around these things," he explained. "I think that the amount of time it takes up from your life is a lot and there are better things you can be doing with your time, so maybe a limited use of social media or a controlled use would be better."

Round 10 being the reverse fixtures from round nine just three weeks ago, there will be a fair whiff of vengeance in the bitingly Baltic mid-winter air around the Energia All-Ireland League this weekend. After the Friday night resumption in a Dublin derby between third-placed Lansdowne and second-placed St Mary’s, the champions and festive Division 1A leaders Clontarf resume their campaign in a repeat of the recent Bateman Cup final against Ballynahinch. The Ulster side led for 67 minutes at Castle Avenue before Clontarf claimed their first Bateman Cup with a 21-16 win thanks to replacement Ivan Soroka’s late try. He now starts in the absence of Alex Usanov while Charlie Ward is recalled at tighthead and both Paul Deeny, brother of Leinster’s Brian, replaces Alex Soroka, and Luke Brady return to the backrow. Ballynahinch, who haven’t beaten Clontarf since 2020, have slipped seven points off the top-four playoff places, so their need is acute. They make just two changes, namely Quinn Armstrong at inside centre and Daniel Bennett on the wing. Fourth-placed Terenure, who lead Cork Con on points difference, are seeking to end a run of three successive defeats after their 30-24 loss to Old Belvedere last time out. They are without Joshua Kenny, who is starting for Leinster against La Rochelle, and hooker John McKee compared to the last meeting, with Aran Egan at outhalf in a reshuffled backline which is notable for the presence of ex-Munster centre Peter Sylvestre for the first time this season as he is home on holidays from Miami. John Devine is also making his Connacht debut in Montpellier, with Eddie Kelly – another former Sevens winger – replacing Kenny. Max Russell reverts to hooker, with ex-Ospreys flanker Will Hickey also returning. Belvo make just two changes, bringing in winger Johnny Kiely and former Ireland under-19s outhalf Donagh O’Dwyer. Con host UCD, having taken a 36-19 away win last time out in Belfield, and are boosted by the return of loosehead Mark Donnelly following his recent loan spell with Ealing Trailfinders, as well as Ireland under-20s centre Eoghan Smyth. Danny Sheehan starts at hooker and Mark Skelly comes into the backrow, while Darragh French shifts from centre to fullback. Young Munster, who sit four points further back after consecutive bonus-point wins, were due to welcome back Evan O’Connell and Ruadhán Quinn but both are now travelling with Munster to Toulon, missing the repeat Munster derby away to Nenagh Ormond. The Tipperary side, who lost 57-10 three weeks ago, welcome back Munster’s ex-Connacht centre Sean O’Brien. Division 1B leaders Old Wesley host Blackrock while in 2A, fifth-placed Corinthians host leaders Barnhall and the only other unbeaten side in the AIL, 2B leaders Galwegians, travel to Skerries. Division 1A: Lansdowne v St Mary’s College, Aviva Stadium Back Pitch, (7.30pm, Friday); Ballynahinch v Clontarf, Ballymacarn Park; Cork Constitution v UCD, Temple Hill; Nenagh Ormond v Young Munster, New Ormond Park; Terenure College v Old Belvedere, Lakelands Park. Division 1B: Instonians v City Of Armagh, Shaw’s Bridge (2pm); Dublin University v Queen’s University, College Park; Garryowen v Highfield, Dooradoyle; Old Wesley v Blackrock College, Energia Park; UCC v Naas, The Mardyle.

Title: ‘You say things and you’re not going to please everyone’: Simon Zebo embraces punditry

The last time Munster played Toulon away in the Champions Cup, two years ago this weekend, Simon Zebo was the red 15. Without a win in their opening two pool matches, Munster trailed 10-0 after 23 minutes and were skidding towards a ditch. The airbag turned out to be a pair of tries. Zebo got the second. The creative credits were shared between the outhalf and the fullback, producer and director. Zebo spotted a thin peninsula of space behind the Toulon cover and shouted at team-mate Jack Crowley to kick. His sumptuous chip greeted Zebo on the first bounce. Behind the try line Zebo was swamped by Munster players, but a photographer, Laszlo Geczo, got a clean shot of Zebo’s wild eyes and the rapture on his face. Great photographs are never silent and Zebo’s roar is the soundtrack of the picture. His top jaw and his bottom jaw are frozen at full stretch, like a hippopotamus’s. As a player this was his shtick: flashes of lightning. “The brighter the lights the better I play,” Zebo had said in an interview before the game. That was his 35th try in the Champions Cup, which put him third on the all-time list. It was also his last. By the end of that season his heart and his legs had reached a state of irreconcilable differences and Zebo retired. “I would have liked to think that I could have played another year, but definitely not two,” Zebo says now. “It wasn’t the matches. I could have played matches for another three years if it was just that. It was the weekly toll that was being taken. Getting to Saturday to play the match was getting harder and harder.” In retirement, though, the bright lights didn’t go dark. Television was drawn to him. He had charisma and knowledge of an ever-changing game and he excited a response. Not everybody was attracted to his innate bubbliness and his naked Munster bias, but that was part of his magnetism too. Television is competing for eyeballs in a bear-pit market. Broadcasters need pundits who can cut through the din. They can’t afford to serve lukewarm tea. While he was still playing, Zebo occasionally turned up in a TV studio, but this season he has been a consistent presence on Premier Sports. When Munster beat Leinster by 31-14 in Croke Park last October, Zebo’s first big outing for the station, his unbridled joy dominated the coverage. When the game finished, he was unleashed with a roving mike to conduct post-match interviews, and he didn’t try to conceal his emotion or defuse his giddiness or hide the fact that he was talking to former team-mates. What did viewers think? Nobody was ambivalent. Either you loved it or you didn’t. Before the match Zebo did a piece comparing the sides’ outhalves, Jack Crowley and Sam Prendergast. He expressed his marginal preference for Crowley with a series of cogent points that praised and criticised both players. But he made it clear how much he admired the Leinster 10. “I just want to put it on the record, Sam Prendergast is an amazing player – because there are a few Leinster crybabies in my inbox,” he said with a laugh. A post shared by Premier Sports (@premsportstv) That segment was shared on Premier Sports’ social media channels and generated nearly 1.5 million impressions, an astonishing number compared to their whistle-to-whistle TV coverage of the match, which reached a peak audience of 78,000. For every broadcaster now, the battle is on many fronts. “I’m always up for having a laugh,” Zebo says. “I want to bring that energy and just show as much personality as possible. I was never a big fan of the generic answers you were used to hearing over and over again. “I’m not afraid to show my personality. People watching want the pundits to be genuine and I think people see beyond the BS when people put up fake personas or pretend to be super polished and not have any loyalties. “I think if I was watching Man United and Man City I would want to watch people who have been in those changing rooms and understand the club, the culture, the history. “If the pundit doesn’t have that energy or connection with the club then I don’t think you will portray the energy needed for the viewer to enjoy the game. That’s where I’d be at. “I’m still trying to find my feet as well. I’m by no means any polished article. I’d love to be super comfortable, as if you were sitting down on the sofa with me watching the game. That would be the ideal scenario. “At the moment, I’m trying to be as insightful as I can and have a bit of fun with it at the same time.” Sky Sports gave up on the pretence of impartiality years ago. In their football coverage there will invariably be somebody in the studio with an affiliation to each club. Rugby was slower to go down that road. Historically, the punditry has been more urbane, as if a game bound up with such complexity required laboratory analysis. There must be a middle ground. When Leinster beat Munster by 13-8 in Thomond Park last month, Leo Cullen came to the post-match interview with a riff he had prepared about Munster having more Leinster ex-pats in their side than Limerick-born players. It was Cullen’s first television appearance as a stand-up. Though his point was made for general consumption, he aimed it at Zebo, who all of a sudden was trapped at the bottom of a ruck, taking a shoeing from a man not wearing studs. It was compelling TV and when Premier released it on their social media channels it attracted about a million impressions; their audience during their exclusive broadcast of the match had peaked at 163,000. “I had to take my medicine,” Zebo says. “As he was slagging me, I was actually counting the amount of [Munster players] who came through Leinster and I was just like, ‘I’m going to have to bite my tongue here’.” In the online world tongue-biting is not a skill much practised. “That’s always the case. I’m not afraid of them. I’ve had them all my life, don’t worry. You say things and you know you’re not going to please everyone. It’s being comfortable in your own skin and saying what you really believe anyway, regardless.” As a player that was his manifesto too: he was true to his instincts. As a rookie on Ireland’s 2012 tour of New Zealand, and a bolter picked for the first Test, he was asked in a press conference what he thought he would bring to the team? “I like to run with the ball,” Zebo said. “I like to attack a lot.” Even though he took a conventional path from Presentation Brothers College, through Cork Constitution to Munster’s academy, he successfully navigated the system without surrendering his individuality. On parallel tracks during his teenage years in Cork, Zebo continued to play hurling with Blackrock, Gaelic football with St Michaels and soccer with Avondale United. All of it fired his imagination. The hackneyed term for a player like Zebo would be “mercurial”, with all that suggests about unpredictability. That description is not always applied as a compliment. Across all team sports the tension between structure and risk is greater now than ever, and that was where Zebo pursued his career: in the febrile space between instruction and instinct, between safe and hairy. Zebo finished his career with 35 Ireland caps and the general feeling was that it left him short. When Joe Schmidt took over as Ireland coach he didn’t pick Zebo for the guts of a year. Schmidt was obsessive about structure and detail, and his successful Irish teams made very few unscripted movements. And yet, 29 of Zebo’s caps came on Schmidt’s watch, and in the last two seasons before he signed for Racing 92, he made 20 appearances for Ireland, 15 as a starter. Schmidt wasn’t blind to Zebo’s charms, but ultimately the issue was trust. When Ireland won the Six Nations in 2015, Zebo played every minute of the first four games until the last match against Scotland when he was omitted from the match day squad. That day, Zebo represented a risk that Schmidt wasn’t prepared to take. “It’s kind of hard. Joe had a game plan and it was an incredibly successful game plan. He was an incredibly successful coach, so it obviously worked. But different styles can suit different players. That doesn’t diminish Joe or his ability, but it was just my style might have better suited to Rob Penney, when he was at Munster – he was amazing. “And Rassie Erasmus as well – he was probably my best ever coach. He was the most incredibly detailed, inspirational man manager. He did everything – everything. He held the team to a standard like no other and he was by far the best for the culture around the club. He brought a family spirit to the club – he was amazing. You’d go to war for him any day. “As soon as he left Munster we were all gutted because we knew success with him was on the horizon. We were all thinking, ‘He’s definitely going to win the World Cup with South Africa’.” Moving to Racing 92 for three seasons in his late 20s ended Zebo’s international career in effect, but it satisfied his desire for adventure. The IRFU couldn’t match the offer on the table either. In 144 games in French club rugby, Zebo scored 60 tries. Racing 92 embraced the flamboyance and the risk. “It suited me brilliantly. The style of rugby I enjoyed was the French style of play. You’d love to have been still available [for Ireland]. I would love to have been rewarded for my form while I was in France. But they were just the rules in place. “I made my decision and I wouldn’t change that. In terms of experiencing the full journey [in my career] part of that was playing in the Top 14. That was very important to me. It’s something I look back on with enormous pride.” Zebo settled back in Cork with his wife Elvira and their four children. All of them are playing the sports that he did as a child. His eldest son and daughter play on an under-11 rugby team in Cork Con that Donncha O’Callaghan coaches. They all go to the same school as Peter O’Mahony’s children. Zebo plays five-a-side soccer with childhood friends who remained his best friends. His children hang out at Blackrock hurling club, just like he did at their age. His life in rugby went through so many cycles and returned him here, unharmed and unchanged. O’Callaghan tells a story about being on a players committee in Munster when Zebo broke into the first team squad. Even in that giant playground Zebo’s lust for fun was outside the norm. Eventually, somebody on the player’s committee said the smile needed to be knocked off Zebo’s face. Nobody ever managed it. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Wall Street’s crypto debate is over as banks go all-in on BTC, stablecoins, tokenized cash

Big banks aren’t debating crypto anymore — they’re building it. From tokenized cash to ETFs, Wall Street is quietly going onchain. Cointelegraph in your social feed For years, major banks treated cryptocurrency primarily as a risk to be contained. That posture is now giving way to a more deliberate form of engagement. Rather than debating crypto’s legitimacy, banks are increasingly deciding how and where to integrate it, from regulated investment products to blockchain-based payment rails. This shift is on full display in this week’s Crypto Biz. JPMorgan is extending its US dollar deposit token onto new blockchain infrastructure, signaling that tokenized cash is moving closer to production use within global banking. Morgan Stanley, meanwhile, is positioning itself to offer exposure to Bitcoin (BTC) and Solana (SOL) through exchange-traded funds (ETFs), potentially bringing crypto investments to millions of wealth management clients. Barclays has made its first bet on stablecoin infrastructure, backing settlement rails designed to connect regulated issuers with financial institutions. And Bank of America has taken another step toward normalization by allowing advisers to recommend spot Bitcoin ETFs to clients. Together, these moves suggest the banking sector is no longer content to watch from the sidelines. JPMorgan announced plans to issue its US dollar-denominated deposit token, JPM Coin (JPMD), natively on the Canton Network, marking another step by Wall Street toward production-ready blockchain infrastructure. Digital Asset, the developer of the Canton Network, and Kinexys by JPMorgan will extend JPM Coin from its existing rails onto Canton’s privacy-focused layer-1 blockchain, enabling regulated digital cash to move across interoperable networks. According to an announcement shared with Cointelegraph, JPM Coin, described as the first bank-issued, US dollar-denominated deposit token for institutional clients, represents a digital claim on JPMorgan’s dollar deposits and is designed to facilitate faster, more secure movement of regulated money on public blockchains. “This collaboration brings to life the vision of regulated digital cash that can move at the speed of markets,” said Yuval Rooz, co-founder and CEO of Digital Asset. US investment bank Morgan Stanley is entering the cryptocurrency exchange-traded fund market, with proposed products offering exposure to Bitcoin and Solana, following the strong debut of spot crypto ETFs in the United States. The bank has filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission to launch two investment vehicles, the Morgan Stanley Bitcoin Trust and the Morgan Stanley Solana Trust, designed to provide passive investment exposure to the performance of their underlying digital assets. If approved, the funds could be made available to more than 19 million clients within Morgan Stanley’s wealth management division, significantly expanding access to crypto-linked investment products. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have ranked among the most successful ETF launches on record, attracting substantial inflows during their first two years of trading. Momentum has continued into the new year, with renewed investor demand driving fresh inflows during the first trading sessions. London-based banking giant Barclays has made its first investment in a stablecoin-focused company, signaling traditional finance’s growing interest in digital dollar infrastructure. The bank announced an undisclosed investment in Ubyx, a US-based stablecoin clearing platform that connects regulated issuers with financial institutions to facilitate settlement and interoperability. The move also marks a notable shift for Barclays, which in recent years has publicly emphasized the risks associated with digital assets. “This investment aligns with Barclays’ approach to explore opportunities based on new forms of digital money, such as stablecoins,” the bank said in a statement. Ubyx has previously raised $10 million in seed funding, backed by Galaxy and Coinbase. The company was founded by Tony McLaughlin, a former Citibank executive. US investors may soon receive recommendations to buy Bitcoin ETFs from Bank of America’s private bank and Merrill Edge platforms, adding to evidence of Bitcoin’s growing integration into traditional finance. The bank’s chief investment office has approved coverage of four U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, including products offered by Bitwise, Fidelity, BlackRock and Grayscale. Collectively, the funds manage more than $100 billion in Bitcoin assets. The move comes roughly a month after Bank of America reportedly advised wealth management clients to allocate 1% to 4% of their portfolios to digital assets. “For investors with a strong interest in thematic innovation and comfort with elevated volatility, a modest allocation of 1% to 4% in digital assets could be appropriate,” Chris Hyzy, chief investment officer at Bank of America Private Bank, told Yahoo.

Title: BNY Rolls Out Tokenized Deposits for Near Real-Time Institutional Settlement

© 2026 Coinspeaker LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. BNY introduces tokenized deposit capability mirroring $55 trillion in institutional cash balances on its private blockchain for faster collateral settlement. BNY, one of the largest global financial services platforms with over $55 trillion in assets, has launched a tokenized deposit capability on its Digital Assets platform. This new feature mirrors institutional clients’ existing cash balances on a private blockchain. It enables near-real-time settlement. The service begins with collateral and margin workflows. BNY’s traditional core banking systems keep all official records in their own private blockchain. BNY launched this new service after deploying tokenization services for money market funds with Goldman Sachs, which was announced in July 2025. According to the company blog, BNY creates on-chain digital book entries that correspond 1:1 to clients’ existing demand deposit claims at the bank. It does not issue new money. BNY records these tokens on its private, permissioned blockchain, which provides a secure, internal network for authorized users. The bank maintains the legal deposits on conventional ledgers for regulatory and reporting purposes. When a client needs to meet margin calls or move collateral, participating institutions can transfer the mirrored balances on-chain in near real time. This setup aims to cut settlement frictions. It also supports an always-on operating model. According to their announcement, the system does not bypass bank supervision or existing risk controls.

Here, intraday liquidity needs and settlement timing are the greatest sources of sensitivity. Institutions shift tokenized balances across the network within seconds to meet margin requirements. They avoid reliance on legacy cut-off times or batch processes. “As institutional markets move toward always-on operating models, BNY is committed to innovating and helping define how cash moves across the modern financial system,” said Carolyn Weinberg, BNY’s Chief Product and Innovation Officer. BNY is not the only company launching tokenized products. BlackRock, another major financial company, has announced that the “tokenization of all assets” has begun. It expects to tokenize more than $4.1 trillion in traditional products. Standard Chartered launched a similar tokenized deposit product in December 2025. Goldman Sachs also continually investigates and develops new tokenized products. This new institutional trend follows the big impetus set in 2025, with the development of Real World Assets (RWA). Over the last year, the real-world use cases of RWA and related projects have grown explosively. Announcements like this show that this technology will likely remain trendy in 2026.

Title: Bitcoin’s next super rally could depend on this key data point

Time Published: 2026-01-09T18:30:00Z

Long-term Bitcoin holders sold nearly $300 billion worth of BTC in 2025, but as this sell pressure declines, a bullish outlook for 2026 has emerged. Cointelegraph in your social feed Update (Jan.11, 2026, 7.35 UTC): This article has been updated to correct the LTH supply figure to 13.6 million BTC. Bitcoin’s long-term holders (LTHs) went through one of the most aggressive distribution phases on record in 2025. While the scale of selling rattled the market, onchain data analysis suggests that this pressure may be fading, possibly outlining the next bullish period for BTC price. Key takeaways: Long-term holders distributed about $300 billion in BTC in 2025, marking a historic supply reset. Heavy LTH selling has occurred near cycle peaks or during structural transitions, not at the start of new downtrends. With selling pressure stalling, the next phase may hinge on how early the long-term holder supply stabilizes. An amount of Bitcoin (BTC) that had remained unmoved for at least two years moved onchain sharply in 2025. Nearly $300 billion worth of Bitcoin that had been dormant for over a year re-entered circulation. The 30 days from Nov. 15 to Dec. 14, 2025, marked one of the heaviest long-term holder (LTH) distribution periods in more than five years. Since 2019, sharp declines in long-term holder (LTH) supply have rarely appeared in isolation. They have surfaced during phases when Bitcoin’s trend was already under strain, either approaching exhaustion or undergoing a structural shift. In 2018, the LTH supply fell to 12 million BTC from 13 million, with selling intensity peaking when the 30-day distribution reached 1.08 million BTC in December. At that point, Bitcoin had already spent months declining. Price bottomed near $3,500 in February 2019, before stabilizing and rallying to $11,000 by mid-year, illustrating how heavy LTH selling could precede recovery rather than mark its end. The 2020–2021 cycle unfolded differently. LTH supply dropped to 11.65 million BTC from 13.7 million BTC, while Bitcoin price rose to $61,000 from $14,000. The 30-day distribution peak of 891,000 BTC did not immediately halt the rally. Instead, selling persisted as prices rose, gradually eroding upside momentum before the cycle ultimately rolled over, a reminder that LTH distribution can accompany expansion before defining its limits. During the 2024–2025 bull run, supply declined to 14.5 million BTC from 15.8 million BTC, with the 30-day distribution peaking at 758,000 BTC. Price topped slightly earlier in March, and both metrics then moved sideways through Q2–Q3, reinforcing a familiar pattern: Price strength tends to fade as long-term holders step up distribution. The final phase in mid-to-late 2025 proved more abrupt. LTH supply briefly recovered to 15.4 million BTC in June, before collapsing to 13.5 million BTC by December, the sharpest decline on record. Price weakness appeared in October, but the most selling followed later, with the largest-ever 30-day distribution peak of 1.14 million BTC in November. That sequence suggests capitulation rather than orderly profit-taking, marking a reset rather than a continuation of the prior trend. Related: Bitcoin RSI hints at $105K BTC price rebound as bull signals multiply Since December, the LTH supply has stopped falling, currently around 13.6 million BTC, while Bitcoin has entered a sideways range. Additional confirmation comes from the long-term/short-term holder supply ratio. Every time this ratio has fallen to –0.5 or below, Bitcoin has either entered a base-building phase or rallied to new highs within weeks. In December, the ratio dropped to about -0.53, after which price volatility compressed and momentum stalled, consistent with a reset rather than trend continuation. Thus this combination, aggressive distribution followed by supply stabilization, has historically marked transition phases rather than trend continuation. If the trend repeats, the consolidation through Q1to Q2 could act as a base-building period, with any sustained rally more likely to emerge later, potentially into Q3.

In a blog post, the institution co-founded by Alexander Hamilton described the move as a key step in bolstering its ability to move “programmable, on‑chain cash” across digital rails. The product is powered by the bank’s private and permissioned blockchain, BNY added. The product is for both institutions and “digital natives,” it added. BNY described its tokenized deposits as digital book entries representing funds that participating clients would be able to withdraw through traditional means. The bank said the tokens will initially be used in circumstances related to collateral and margin. The move underscored how Wall Street incumbents are increasingly using digital assets as a way to augment their existing businesses. BNY highlighted the ability of tokenized deposits to “reduce settlement friction” and “improve liquidity efficiency” in various settings. The company noted that clients’ balances, although they will be represented on-chain, will continue to be recorded with BNY’s traditional systems for compliance purposes. In a statement, BNY Chief Product and Innovation Officer Carolyn Weinberg underscored the trusted nature of the institution’s bank deposits. The bank, which has existed for more than 240 years, safeguarded $57.8 trillion in assets on behalf of clients, as of September. The New York-based behemoth also has $2.1 trillion in assets under management. As competitors like JPMorgan expand tokenized deposits to various networks, BNY said that its version of the product will serve as “the connective tissue of BNY’s digital infrastructure,” which includes a tokenized money-market fund with Goldman Sachs that was unveiled in July. After forming its digital assets unit in 2021, the company started managing private keys for clients the following year, with the debut of custody services for Bitcoin and Ethereum. BNY’s blog post included statements from around a dozen crypto-native firms, including crypto bank Anchorage Digital, stablecoin issuers Circle and Paxos, BlackRock-backed tokenization specialist Securitize, and Ripple’s institutional prime brokerage platform, Ripple Prime. “BNY taking this step to enable tokenized deposits is a milestone moment for digital cash adoption,” Anchorage Digital co-founder and CEO Nathan McCauley said. Citadel Securities, which said in July that it accounts for 25% of U.S. equity volume, also described tokenization as crucial for the future of finance. The market-making giant's CEO, Ken Griffin, had in 2021 called crypto a “jihadist call” against the U.S. dollar.

Title: Historical Data Tells Why Bitcoin Might Record a Parabolic Run in Q1 2026

Historical performance patterns are shaping expectations of a strong first quarter for Bitcoin, especially following a muted year that preceded it. Data shows that Q1 has treated Bitcoin well, even in extreme bear market conditions. Since the negative first quarter of 2018, subsequent Q1 periods have delivered relatively resilient returns, even in the notoriously bearish 2022. After more than a month of sideways movement, price action has settled into a clearly defined channel that resembles an accumulation range rather than a continuation of a broader downtrend. The persistence of this range strengthens the probability that a local bottom has already formed. Market observers note that a decisive break above the $94,500 level could quickly unlock momentum, putting the psychologically critical $100,000 mark back firmly in focus. For further context, Bitcoin’s recent technical behavior is drawing comparisons to gold’s 2018 cycle. Gold at that time spent months bleeding lower within a falling wedge before breaking out, briefly retesting support, and then entering a powerful price discovery phase. Bitcoin has now exited a similar wedge formation, suggesting a comparable sequence may unfold. A shallow pullback followed by renewed upside would fit neatly into this historical analogue, and potentially accelerate sentiment as the year progresses. However, near-term flows are mixed. Recent data shows U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs experienced net outflows late in December, with products from BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale, Ark, and 21Shares recording redemptions. On December 26 alone, IBIT, FBTC, and GBTC collectively saw outflows exceeding $589 million, followed by another round of redemptions on December 31, led again by IBIT. Additional funds, including BITB, HODL, BTCO, and EZBC, also posted weekly outflows. Despite this, the overall narrative is intact. Bitcoin’s longer-term trajectory balances institutional demand through reserves and ETFs with ongoing technical evolution, including Layer 2 development and preparations for post-quantum security. If historical Q1 tendencies align with improving structure and macro liquidity, the conditions for a parabolic move may already be forming.

Title: Should You Use the New Vanguard Target Retirement Lifetime Income Funds?

Learn to make your money work as hard as you, so you can focus on your patients, your family, and your own wellness. Quick Start Page Recommended Professionals Financial Boot Camp Since mid-2024, BlackRock has been offering lifecycle-style ETFs that include an income annuity as part of the mix of assets. Now, it looks like Vanguard wants to get in on the action, announcing in December 2025 a new series of target retirement funds called Target Retirement Lifetime Income Funds. You should know two things about the Target Retirement Lifetime Income Funds. The first is that this is a new series of funds. We're not talking about all of Vanguard's target retirement funds that were introduced in 2003. Totally different funds. I have no idea why Vanguard used such a similar name, but there will be substantial confusion—especially since the existing target retirement funds include one that is called Target Retirement Income Fund. The key difference is the word “lifetime” in the title. The second thing is that these funds will only be available in employer-sponsored plans like 401(k)s and 403(b)s. That seems kind of silly, so hopefully that's a temporary thing. The reason it's silly is that when people leave their employers to retire (i.e., the time when an immediate annuity of some kind actually makes sense), they usually roll their 401(k) or 403(b) money to an IRA to allow for more control, more investing options, and often lower fees. Now there's an option available in the 401(k) but not the IRA? What a pain. Perhaps the reason these funds will be a 401(k)-only option is because they are not actually mutual funds. They are Collective Investment Trusts (CITs). Here is an excerpt from a future WCI post on CITs, currently scheduled for publication in March 2026: A CIT is a mutual fund alternative that only exists inside qualified retirement plans, like your 401(k). It's best to just consider it the same thing as a mutual fund, but there are a few minor differences, none of which are really bad. Google lists them well: Bottom line, sometimes CITs are put into 401(k)s instead of mutual funds because they're slightly cheaper. Most of them are index funds or lifecycle-style balanced funds, which is generally a good thing for 401(k) participants. However, because they don't have ticker symbols like mutual funds and stocks, CITs can be a little harder to research on the internet (such as Morningstar and similar resources). More frequently you'll just have to obtain and review the information provided by Human Resources at your company or the 401(k) provider to learn more about the investments. The plan for Vanguard is for these new target retirement funds to look like the older ones, at least until you hit the age of 55. Then, it'll start replacing some of the assets with an immediate annuity to provide more guaranteed income. Morningstar hypothesized that it would look like this: The annuity portion will apparently be run by TIAA-CREF. The idea is to provide a more stable income during those years when you really want a stable income: during your retirement. Perhaps it will help reduce the Sequence of Returns Risk a little better than the mix of stocks and bonds in the older version of target retirement funds. More information here: Best Investment Portfolios — 150+ Portfolios Better Than Yours The 15 Questions You Need to Answer to Build Your Investment Portfolio Probably not. Few have. They're brand new. That's reason enough for me not to buy them. Besides, for most WCIers, lifecycle funds are something they grow out of by necessity as their retirement account situation becomes more complex. It's fine for your Roth IRA in residency. Not so fine when you have a 403(b), a solo 401(k), Roth IRAs, a 457(b), a cash balance plan, and a big taxable account. Target retirement funds are all-in-one solutions that function great when all of your investments are in retirement accounts that offer them. That's not the case for most WCIers by the time they're 55, when this new series of target retirement funds would even start incorporating the annuities. I don't necessarily think these annuity-containing lifecycle funds are a terrible idea, but they also feel like a solution looking for a problem. I suspect most WCIers who want to annuitize a portion of their retirement assets are going to do it directly rather than via a target retirement fund—especially since you can't even buy these things in an IRA. It's good to know these Vanguard Target Retirement Lifetime Income Funds exist, but I think you can pass on them for now. What do you think? Are you interested in lifecycle funds that contain annuities? Why or why not? James M. Dahle, MD, FACEP, FAAEM is a practicing emergency physician and the founder of The White Coat Investor.

Δ Δ The problem these solve is that retirees move their money out of the employer plans. I can tell you that my father’s retirement has been financed mainly by TIAA and it has been extremely lucrative. The TIAA-CREF representative told him that his retirement was funded with 30 year treasuries that were purchased in the 70’s and 80’s when you could get 10% (for 30 years). 30 year rates are back to generational highs right now – but only at about 5%. I think Vanguard is trying to capture that lightning again with a vehicle that can pay out better than 5% yearly for the duration of retirement. This is to entice retiring employees to continue to use the employer funds – which was TIAA-CREF’s secret power. I actually think the tranche of retirees and near retirees who move into this (right now) could actually do pretty well.

Title: Colin Hunt: ‘We’ve seen greenwashing. The new phenomenon is greenhushing’

For Colin Hunt, the Lego-loving chief executive of AIB, the State’s exit as investor in 2025 marked a satisfying milestone, with a big final piece of the bank’s painstaking rebuild clicking into place. “It was an important moment from a morale perspective, but it hasn’t led to any change in strategy or operations, because, in fairness, the State always acted as a rational investor and had a clear desire to exit the share register at a point in time,” said Hunt in an interview with The Irish Times. But some things have changed permanently since taxpayers were forced to commit €20.8 billion to prevent the bank’s collapse during the global financial crisis (GFC), he said. “AIB’s a very different organisation now. I think we’re far more externally oriented than we would have been pre-crisis. And I think AIB’s a less siloed, less hierarchical organisation than it was,” he said. “Banking globally is a very, very procyclical industry and, traditionally, banks would have overlent at the top of [economic] cycles and underlent at the bottom. Our approach now is very much that we take a medium term, acyclical approach and lend through the cycle.” The regulatory environment has changed utterly, too, with banks on both sides of the Atlantic required to hold higher levels of capital reserves and have ‘living wills’ in place to bail-in creditors if regulators deem a lender is likely to fail. The Central Bank of Ireland has gone further, introducing some of the strictest mortgage lending restrictions in Europe, higher fines for wrongdoing, and a regime to make it easier to find senior executives responsible for failings under their watch. “We’re very aware that without the support of Irish taxpayers, this bank would have ceased to exist,” said Hunt. “However, that would have been extraordinarily detrimental to the Irish economy and to our society.” At the end of October, AIB bought back stock warrants that the Government continued to hold in the bank after selling its remaining shares in the lender during the summer. It brought the total that the State has recovered from the bank’s rescue to almost €20.2 billion – leaving a shortfall of a little over €600 million. [ From PTSB sale to Revolut’s mortgage entry: why 2026 is set to be busy year in bankingOpens in new window ] Yet it was far from certain that taxpayers would recoup so much from Ireland’s costliest bailout of a surviving lender – particularly when AIB shares were trading below €1 each during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, just a seventh of the price at which the final shares were sold last June. However, the crisis led to two key developments that have fuelled the bank’s turnaround: a surge in inflation – further stoked by the Ukraine war – that triggered aggressive central bank rate hikes; and the purchase of two large loan books from Ulster Bank, as it exited the market. Ulster’s owner, NatWest, had highlighted the impact of Covid-19 when it confirmed in late 2020 that it was carrying out a strategic review of the bank. AIB – among the most rates-sensitive banks across the sector in Europe – couldn’t help but make record profits in recent years. Indeed, when the European Central Bank’s (ECB) deposit rate peaked at 4 per cent early 2024, AIB was making more money out of parking €32 billion of surplus deposits with the Central Bank than it was from its €35.7 billion Irish mortgage book. But Hunt, who took charge of the bank in 2019, said that measures undertaken by the bank have also underpinned earnings, including the use of financial derivatives – known as interest rate swaps – to protect the bank as the benchmark ECB rate fell by half in 13 months to last June. “That’s an insurance policy that’s working very well,” he said. AIB forecast in November that net interest income would decline only about 10 per cent last year from a record €4.13 billion in 2024. There is a strong preference for instant access on the part of depositors in Ireland and I think that is to do with the psychological scarring from the financial crisis AIB has seen its underlying loan book grow over the past four years, even after stripping out acquired Ulster loans. It follows a series of false dawns for when Irish bank balance sheets would grow again, after contracting dramatically after the financial crash. Hunt has also set up AIB for “a big opportunity” with decisions to repurchase Goodbody Stockbrokers, where he previously served as chief economist, in 2021 and get the bank back into life and pensions after a decade out of this business, by setting up a joint venture, AIB Life, with Canada’s Great-West Lifeco in 2023. Ageing populations are one of three “huge megatrends” (along with artificial intelligence, or AI, and electrification) that Hunt reckons will change the banking sector over the long term. The Republic’s old-age dependency ratio – the percentage of the population aged over 65 relative to those between 15 and 64 – will more than double to about 50 per cent in 2057. “There is inevitably going to be an increase in demand for savings, investment and pensions and it is incumbent on us to make sure that we have AIB-branded products available to our customers,” said Hunt. “And we now have that.” Still, it has a distance to go to catch up with its biggest rival on that front. [ ‘Down to the wire’: ECB’s digital euro project faces decisive vote in 2026Opens in new window ] Bank of Ireland managed to convince the European Commission in 2013 not to force a sale of its New Ireland arm under a restructuring plan tied to its taxpayer bailout. It also repurchased its former Davy unit in 2022, after the firm was plunged into crisis in the wake of a regulatory fine. RBC Capital Markets analysts estimated in a report last month that AIB had €17 billion of assets under management (AUM) at the end of 2025, with Goodbody accounting for 85 per cent and AIB Life the remainder. Bank of Ireland’s AUM stands at €58 billion, with a little over half of this in Davy. While Irish households have grown their wealth by an average of 7 per cent a year over the past decade – more than twice the European rate – they still hold only 12 per cent of their net worth in financial products, including life and investment products and direct shareholdings in companies, the RBC report said. This compares to 19 per cent in France and 16 per cent in Italy and Germany. With 85 per cent of the €172 billion of Irish household deposits sitting in current and on-demand deposit accounts earning little or nothing, according to the latest Central Bank data, RBC said AIB, with the greatest share of Irish deposits, has the best opportunity to nudge customers towards savings and investment products. Goodbody is also known to be in advanced talks to buy BCP Asset Management, which has about €3 billion of AUM. The relationship between AIB and Goodbody is “fundamentally different” from the one that existed when he left the stockbroking firm in 2004, said Hunt. AIB went on to sell the company in 2011 under an EU restructuring plan tied to its bailout. “There were tensions in that relationship that are absent now,” he said. “There is real collaboration and engagement. The AIB that Goodbody came back to is a fundamentally different beast from the one it left.” [ Don’t be fooled — everything has changed for the global economyOpens in new window ] Goodbody now provides investment, pension, and financial planning services for AIB Private Banking clients, whereas under the previous ownership, they competed against each other. Convincing households to put idle money on deposit to potentially better use may be difficult. “There is a strong preference for instant access on the part of depositors in Ireland and I think that is to do with the psychological scarring from the financial crisis,” said Hunt, who was surprised by how reluctant households were to move money to higher-earning term deposits that banks started to offer when ECB rates spiked. The residual trauma has played out in other ways, with debt across households and small businesses at a fraction of where they stood before the crisis, relative to income. “Leverage was completely overinflated in 2007. But, for me, one of the great mysteries in the past 10 years is that while we have had a marked recovery in Irish economic activity, we haven’t seen an increase in credit demand,” he said. “And the best explanation from what I’ve seen is that it’s down to the psychological damage done by the GFC and the collapse of the Irish economy.” AIB disappointed the stock market in early August when it reported that its loan book grew by only 1 per cent in the first half of the year to €71.6 billion, and downgraded its full-year growth forecast to 3 per cent from 5 per cent. This was mainly down to weakness in its international climate capital business, the smallest, but fastest-growing division in recent years, which specialises in large renewable and infrastructure projects across Ireland, Britain, Europe and North America, and caution among small Irish businesses. There was a notable slowdown in green energy investments in the US when Donald Trump took office as president in early 2025. “I think that decisions might have been paused initially,” said Hunt. “There is significantly less talk about the green transition than there was a few years ago. But it’s still happening.” Global spending on green energy investment rose almost 5 per cent to $2.2 trillion last year, double what was allocated to fossil fuels, according to International Energy Agency estimates. “We’ve had greenwashing in the past. The new phenomenon at work now is greenhushing. Investments are being made, projects are being built, but people aren’t talking about it,” he said. “I’ve been of the view for a very long time that capital will need to be deployed [for the green transition] at a scale and pace that we have never seen in the history of global banking. So, it’s an absolutely enormous opportunity – and it requires a certain skill set to safely, prudently deploy capital in this space. We have built that skill set over time.” When Hunt set up a capital climate unit after joining AIB in 2016 from Macquarie to run what was then the group’s wholesale, institutional and corporate banking division, it had four people. It now has about 110. “They do amazing work. They have a really strong reputation.” The team tends to be the lead arranger on many of the multi-banked deals in which it is involved – giving it the opportunity to shape transactions and secure higher fees. The pace at which AI-enabled products and services is evolving is just incredible. It’s going to change our operating environment in ways that we probably can’t even currently envision or imagine On the retail side of the house, close to 60 per cent of the mortgage business written last year was for green loans – where the property has a building energy rating (Ber) between A1 and B3. All told, AIB exited 2025 “with good momentum” on the lending side, Hunt said, adding that he is “comfortable with the medium-term expectation that our loan book will grow by 5 per cent” on a compound annual growth rate basis. Hunt has insisted AIB will bring its running costs, which breached €2 billion last year, back below that level in 2026 – despite its commitment to increase salaries and ongoing inflation – as it continues a policy of not replacing most of the staff who are retiring or quitting naturally. Some analysts say the target will be a tough ask. Total headcount fell by 3 per cent in the 12 months to September – to about 10,350. AIB has become the early front-runner among the domestic banks in warming to AI. It introduced a conversational assistant, called Abi, to customers in 2024 to help with everyday banking questions across its phone and online banking systems. It also rolled out Microsoft Copilot, an AI assistant that helps users write, summarise, analyse data and complete everyday tasks, across the organisation last year. “The pace at which AI-enabled products and services is evolving is just incredible,” he said. “It’s going to change our operating environment in ways that we probably can’t even currently envision or imagine.” Asked if he sees the increased adoption of AI ultimately leading to AIB targeting a much lower workforce, Hunt said: “We’re looking at AI now in terms of cyber [security], fraud detection, our IT resilience, and coding. And I do think you will see it become ever more present in all aspects of the business in the next number of years. Do I have numbers in my head about how this is going to impact our cost base? No. Do I think we’re going to be very significantly reducing our headcount? No.” Hunt said he sees AIB reducing its total workforce by 2-3 per cent a year, through ongoing natural attrition, “in the years ahead”. [ OTC Markets targets Irish companies as listing alternative in New YorkOpens in new window ] The chief executive, meanwhile, has pressed ahead with a plan for staff to work from one of its offices for a minimum of three days a week from the start of the year, even after the Financial Services Union (FSU) said members in the bank had voted “overwhelmingly” to reject the blueprint. The bank is continuing talks this month with the union under the guidance of a mediator on concerns and issues around the new hybrid working model. This year will see Hunt and his team work on the bank’s next three-year strategic plan, which will be presented to the board in November, and will run from 2027. “I’m not letting too many cats out of the bag at this stage by saying I don’t think that our strategic priorities are going to change,” he said. Of big interest to investors will be guidance on how the bank plans to distribute excess capital over the period. RBC estimates AIB has the capacity to fork out €5.7 billion to shareholders over three years by way of dividends and share buy-backs. AIB is also planning the launch of a mobile app in the second half of the year. “I’m really pleased with the shape it’s taking,” said Hunt. “It’s going to be far more intuitive and far easier to use, and it’s going to be more encompassing of all aspects of a person’s financial life.” In the near term, investors will learn how AIB plans to remunerate Hunt, after the Government lifted a bailout-era €500,000 executive pay cap last summer after selling its remaining shares in the bank. “It’s not a matter that I have any influence over. That is decided upon by the remuneration committee of the board, and ultimately by the board itself,” he said, adding that any changes will be revealed at the time of the annual results release, in early March.

Whales locked supply, leverage unwound, yet ETH refused to move decisively. What’s holding price in place? On-chain data showed whales rotating $31.7 million into staked Ethereum, locking over 40,000 stETH as BlackRock accumulated ETH during market volatility. Large holders continued rotating capital into ETH staking. One whale redeployed $31.7 million via Wintermute, then converted the funds into over 40,000 stETH, worth roughly $126 million. That move locked the supply instead of keeping it liquid. Alongside this, BlackRock added 46,851 ETH, valued near $149 million, over three consecutive days, reinforcing sustained accumulation. Meanwhile, BitMine expanded its commitment by staking an additional 19,200 ETH. This pushed its total staked balance to 827,008 ETH, worth about $2.62 billion. These figures mattered because staking and accumulation removed ETH from circulation. As a result, immediate sell-side pressure continued to thin. Even so, the price did not react impulsively. Ethereum [ETH] traded inside a clearly defined range, reflecting balance rather than weakness. Sellers continued defending the $3,300–3,350 supply zone, where several recovery attempts stalled. Buyers, however, consistently stepped in near the $2,780–2,850 demand zone. Recent pullbacks slowed around $2,800, then rebounded toward $3,100 without acceleration. This repeated behavior highlighted absorption. Volatility narrowed as the price oscillated between these levels. As a result, downside momentum weakened with each test of demand. Sellers struggled to force continuation. Buyers also avoided chasing breakouts. Instead, they accumulated gradually. This range-bound structure aligned with growing staking activity. Locked supply reduced panic selling. Consequently, price stability improved as the market waited for direction. Source: TradingView Spot flow data reinforced the same narrative. ETH continued posting persistent net outflows from exchanges. Recent daily figures showed withdrawals exceeding $52.3M, extending a multi-week trend. This matters because exchanges represent immediate selling venues. When ETH exits, sellers lose fast access to liquidity. Therefore, the circulating supply keeps tightening. However, price has not surged sharply. That detail signals accumulation rather than speculative chasing. Buyers absorb supply without forcing higher levels. Meanwhile, sellers fail to generate follow-through on dips. Outflows remain steady rather than reactive. This consistency reduces downside risk. Each retracement meets thinner sell pressure. Consequently, ETH stabilizes faster after pullbacks, reinforcing the broader compression structure. Source: CoinGlass Derivatives data added another layer to the picture. Open Interest declined by about 2.03%, settling near $40.64 billion. That drop reflected leverage unwinding rather than aggressive short positioning. Importantly, the ETH price held firm during the reduction. This limited forced liquidations and cooled volatility. As leverage exited, the market reset risk instead of amplifying moves. Lower Open Interest reduced liquidation cascades during pullbacks. Consequently, downside moves lost speed and depth. Combined with staking growth and exchange outflows, reduced leverage supported price stability. The market shifted from speculation toward positioning. Source: CoinGlass Overall, growing staking and accumulation activity pointed to rising conviction that downside risk remained limited at current levels. Locked supply, persistent exchange outflows, and declining leverage continued to reduce selling pressure. Upside remained gradual, but structure favored stability over breakdowns.

Title: Warner Bros investors torn on Paramount Skydance bid

Some investors criticise board’s rejection of Paramount’s offer, citing better regulatory chances Share Save Some of Warner Bros Discovery’s biggest investors are split on Paramount Skydance’s sweetened offer for the storied movie studio owner, giving the smaller media company a fighting chance at winning over shareholders. Investors have until January 21 to accept Paramount’s latest $108.4bn proposal, paying them $30 a share, an offer the Warner Bros board says is inferior to its agreement to sell to Netflix. Though the creator of, Stranger Things, is offering just $27.75 a share or $82.7bn, Warner Bros says the financing is more solid and that Paramount’s deal would leave the merged company with too much debt. Alex Fitch, partner and portfolio manager for Harris Oakmark, which held about 96 million shares, or 4 percent of Warner Bros, as of September 30, agrees with the board. “The value still isn’t clearly superior to what has already been agreed to with Netflix. A tie goes to the incumbent,” Fitch said in an email to Reuters. Though Paramount’s offer, on its face, is higher, Warner Bros said it does not cover the $2.8bn breakup fee it would have to pay Netflix, $1.5bn in fees it would owe its bankers and another $350m in financing costs. A smaller investor, Yussef Gheriani, chief investment officer of IHT Wealth Management, which has about 16,000 Warner Bros shares, said in an email that the board’s decision to reject Paramount’s offer makes sense as the increase in total value may not be worth breakup fees and borrowing costs. The deal would leave the combined company with $87bn in debt, Warner Bros said. But Matthew Halbower of Pentwater Capital Management, which said it owns more than 50 million shares, feels differently. He told Warner Bros Chairman Samuel DiPiazza in a letter sent on Wednesday that the board “breached its fiduciary duty” to shareholders by rejecting Paramount’s offer out of hand, saying it was a better deal and had a better chance of clearing regulatory scrutiny. Warner Bros’s board “is choosing not to inquire about what improvements Paramount is willing to make to its offer,” he said in the letter, which was reviewed by Reuters. If Paramount does eventually further improve its $30-per-share offer, the Warner Bros board should at least talk with the suitor, or his firm will not support any Warner Bros directors at their next election, Halbower wrote. Mario Gabelli, whose Gabelli Funds holds about 5.7 million shares of Warner Bros, according to LSEG data, said he is “likely” to sell his shares to Paramount. He said its all-cash offer is more straightforward and would have a faster path to regulatory approval. “At the moment, Paramount has a superior bid,” Gabelli told CNBC. “Netflix has to simplify their bid.” Harris Oakmark, which is Warner Bros’ fifth-largest shareholder, remains open to changing its position. “If they [Paramount] come back to the table with a clearly superior offer, we have full confidence that the WBD board will engage,” Fitch said. It is not often that a marquee media asset like Warner Bros, which owns HBO Max, comes to market, sparking a bidding war. Its extensive content library includes Harry Potter and the DC Comics universe. Its HBO Max streaming service recently acquired the US and Australian distribution rights to the runaway hit, Canadian hockey romance, Heated Rivalry. Warner Bros’s top three shareholders are the large passive fund managers Vanguard, State Street and BlackRock, together controlling some 22 percent. All three are also among the top 10 investors in Paramount and Netflix. On Wall Street, Warner Bros stock is down 0.7 percent while Paramount stock is up 0.7 percent in midday trading. Netflix is trending downwards at 0.2 percent below the market open. Follow Al Jazeera English:

Posted on 01/08/2026 12:03:42 PM PST by CFW (The Center Square) - California’s main state retirement fund, CalPERS, announced the hiring of a new chief diversity, equity, and inclusion officer whose listed duties include integrating DEI principles into investment practices, and recruiting staff for DEI-informed proxy voting and ESG investing, The Center Square has learned.

Title: Some of Warner Bros' biggest investors are split on Paramount offer

Business Paramount and Warner Bros logos are seen in this illustration taken December 8, 2025. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration Jan 8 : Some ‌of Warner Bros Discovery's biggest investors are split on Paramount Skydance's sweetened offer for the storied movie studio owner, giving the smaller media company a fighting chance at winning over shareholders. Investors have until Jan. 21 to accept Paramount's latest $108.4 billion proposal, paying them $30 a share, an offer the Warner Bros board says is inferior to its agreement to sell to Netflix. Though the creator of "Stranger Things" is offering just $27.75 a share or $82.7 billion, Warner Bros says the financing is more solid and that Paramount's deal would leave the merged company with too much debt. Alex Fitch, partner and portfolio manager for Harris Oakmark, which held about 96 million shares, or 4 per cent of Warner Bros, ‌as of Sept 30, agrees with the board. "The value still isn’t clearly superior to what has already ‌been agreed to with Netflix. A tie goes to the incumbent," Fitch said in an e-mail to Reuters.

Loading Though Paramount's offer, on its face, is higher, Warner Bros said it doesn't cover the $2.8 billion breakup fee it would have to pay Netflix, $1.5 billion in fees it would owe its bankers and another $350 million in financing costs. A smaller investor, Yussef Gheriani, Chief Investment Officer of IHT Wealth Management, which has about 16,000 Warner Bros shares, said in an email that the board's decision to reject Paramount's offer makes sense as the increase in total value may not be worth breakup fees and borrowing costs. The ‍deal would leave the combined company with $87 billion in debt, Warner Bros said. But Matthew Halbower of Pentwater Capital Management, which said it owns more than 50 million shares, feels differently. He told Warner Bros Chairman Samuel DiPiazza in a letter sent Wednesday that the board "breached its fiduciary duty" to shareholders by rejecting Paramount's offer out of hand, saying it was a better deal and had a better chance of clearing regulatory scrutiny.Warner Bros' board "is choosing not to inquire about what improvements ​Paramount is willing to make to its offer," he ‌said in the letter, which was reviewed by Reuters. If Paramount does eventually further improve its $30-per-share offer, the Warner Bros board should at least talk with the suitor, or his firm will not support any Warner Bros directors at their next election, Halbower wrote. Mario ​Gabelli, whose Gabelli Funds holds about 5.7 million shares of Warner Bros, according to LSEG data, said he is “likely” to sell his shares to Paramount. He said ⁠its all-cash offer is more straightforward and would have a faster path ‌to regulatory approval.“At the moment, Paramount has a superior bid,” Gabelli told CNBC. “Netflix has to simplify their bid.”Harris Oakmark, which is Warner Bros' fifth-largest ​shareholder, remains open to changing its position. "If they (Paramount) come back to the table with a clearly superior offer, we have full confidence that the WBD board will engage," Fitch said.It's not often that a marquee media asset like Warner Bros, which owns HBO ‍Max, comes to market, sparking a bidding war. Its extensive content library includes "Harry Potter" and the DC Comics universe. Its HBO Max streaming service recently acquired ⁠the U.S. and Australian distribution rights to runaway hit, Canadian hockey romance "Heated Rivalry."Warner Bros' top three shareholders are the large passive fund managers Vanguard, State Street and BlackRock, together controlling some ​22 per cent. All three are also among the ‌top ten investors in Paramount and Netflix. All three fund firms declined to comment.

Title: BlackRock adds $900M BTC as Bitcoin long-term selling falls to 2017 lows
URL: https://cointelegraph.com/news/blackrock-adds-dollar900m-btc-as-bitcoin-long-term-selling-falls-to-2017-lows

BlackRock added close to 9,000 BTC during the first week of January, rebuilding exposure after an end-of-year drawdown in 2025 and pointing to early signs of BTC accumulation. Cointelegraph in your social feed BlackRock’s fresh round of Bitcoin (BTC) buying takes place alongside a sharp slowdown in long-term selling, a combination that points to cooling downside pressure after the recent market pullback in Q4. Key takeaways: BlackRock added nearly $900 million worth of Bitcoin in the first week of January, rebuilding exposure after an end-of-2025 drawdown. Long-term Bitcoin holders are selling at their lowest rate since 2017, despite elevated prices. Onchain data pointed to a possible accumulation phase among certain wallet cohorts. Data from Lookonchain indicated BlackRock has accumulated Bitcoin for the past three days, adding 9,619 BTC valued at roughly $878 million. The asset management company currently holds about 780,400 BTC, worth $70 billion. BlackRock’s BTC holdings peaked on Nov. 30 at about 804,000 BTC. At the time, that position was valued at roughly $96.5 billion. Although holdings fell to 771,000 BTC by Jan. 1, BlackRock has swiftly added close to 9,000 BTC during the first week of January. The institutional buying coincided with a notable shift among long-term holders. Bitcoin’s Exchange Inflow Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) metric on Binance has fallen to its lowest level since 2017, signaling that older coins are barely moving onto exchanges. For context, long-term holder supply dropped to 13.6 million in November 2025 from over 15 million in July 2025. Over the past couple of months, the long-term supply has not decreased further. Onchain data from CryptoQuant helps explain this shift. The SOPR Ratio, which broadly compares whether recent buyers and long-term holders are selling at a profit or loss, has dropped to levels associated with market resets. Newer participants are selling at losses, while long-term holders remain profitable and largely inactive. This pattern reflects a clean-up phase after sharp rallies, where speculative positions unwind, and coins change hands at lower prices. With Bitcoin down roughly 20% to 25% from its highs, this dynamic can mark the early stages of accumulation, provided selling pressure from recent buyers continues to drop. Related: Morgan Stanley’s Bitcoin ETF could offer strategic value beyond inflows, analysts say Bitcoin’s Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) added another layer of context. The metric currently sits near the 0.3 level, a zone that has historically marked transitions from recovery into more constructive market conditions. Holders, on average, are back in moderate profit, but the market remains far from the excess seen near major cycle tops. This positioning suggests a cautious transition phase rather than a clear breakout. Confidence appears to be rebuilding, but broader confirmation on both onchain and market structure would be needed before a stronger move.

Title: Why BlackRock’s $1B crypto bet could shape markets in 2026
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/why-blackrocks-1b-crypto-bet-could-shape-markets-in-2026/
Time Published: 2026-01-08T14:00:16Z

BlackRock’s latest move signals a pivotal moment for the 2026 bull cycle – Here’s what you should know. BlackRock has officially ended its silence. After a period of strategic inactivity, the world’s largest asset manager has re‑entered the market, beginning a high‑conviction accumulation phase. On-chain data from Lookonchain reveals that over the last 72 hours, BlackRock has absorbed nearly $1 billion in digital assets. The firm transferred 9,619 BTC valued at $878 million and 46,851 ETH worth $149 million into its custody. This three-day blitz signals a decisive pivot from the choppy outflows of late 2025 into a concentrated ‘ETF 2.0’ era for 2026. To understand why BlackRock goes through long periods of flatlining followed by massive spikes, let’s view the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) as a global liquidity grocery store. During mute weeks, the store isn’t empty; it’s simply operating off the inventory kept in the backroom. In technical terms, this is the secondary market buffer. Authorized Participants (APs) often hold a surplus of shares or Bitcoin [BTC], allowing them to satisfy buy orders without the ETF ever needing to interact with the underlying spot market. To the outside observer, BlackRock appears inactive. But, in reality, the backroom supply is being quietly absorbed by investors. This is when the accumulation week triggers as the shelves run bare. When internal liquidity is exhausted or when quarterly rebalancing cycles converge, BlackRock is forced to enter the spot market to restock. This creates the massive green bars we see in the data, not necessarily representing a sudden change in sentiment, but the visible fulfillment of weeks of pent-up institutional demand. Needless to say, BlackRock’s Ethereum ETF also falls into the same analysis. This comes at a time when, after a surge of optimism kicked off 2026, the market has hit a technical speed bump. Despite the three-day accumulation streak, BlackRock’s IBIT recorded outflows worth $130 million, cooling off from the inflows seen in the first week of the New Year. Similarly, BlackRock’s ETHA also saw $6.6 million in outflows this week, following a strong opening week. Meanwhile, at the time of writing, the market was feeling the weight of this consolidation. Bitcoin was trading at $90,245.14, down by 2.41% in 24 hours, while Ethereum [ETH] has slipped to $3,118.03, a 4.99% drop during the same period. When such movements happen, these prices typically move sideways. The lack of aggressive selling from institutional giants prevents a total collapse, stabilizing the market at these higher valuations. For traders, this is the calm before the shock. History also shows that once BlackRock finishes this quiet accumulation, the resulting supply squeeze is often what pushes Bitcoin through major resistance levels, like the current $94,500 barrier.

Share this article BlackRock, the global investment management firm, moved about 3,064 Bitcoin, valued at roughly $276 million, along with 26,723 Ethereum worth more than $83 million, to Coinbase Prime today, according to data from Arkham Intelligence. The latest transfers come as ETF flows in early 2026 turned volatile, with strong inflows at the start of January quickly giving way to sharp outflows. After solid buying on Jan 2 and Jan 5, sentiment reversed sharply on Jan 6 and Jan 7, resulting in net outflows for the period, per Farside Investors. IBIT, BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF, posted $130 million in redemptions yesterday as US spot Bitcoin funds suffered $486 million in net outflows, their biggest daily outflow since late November.

Key resistance tests await the world’s largest altcoin. On 07 January 2026, Ethereum’s price surged to a critical $3,200-$3,400 resistance zone, with the market teetering on the edge. With liquidity building up around this level, the question remains – Can ETH break through this resistance, or would a pullback be imminent? James Wynn is in the news today after his 25x leveraged Ethereum long position, securing $87,594 in Bitcoin profits before diving into ETH. His floating profit of $172k from his $PEPE position was a testament to his aggressive strategy. Source: Onchain Lens Wynn’s bold approach highlights his confidence in Ethereum’s potential, especially as the digital asset is challenged by its key resistance levels. His aggressive positioning at these levels is a sign of optimism among crypto traders about the altcoin’s future. Ethereum’s bullish momentum surged on the back of record $114M inflows into Ethereum [ETH] ETFs on 06 January. Institutional investments, led by BlackRock, have spurred its credibility over the past few weeks and months. Source: Ted Pillows The recent hike in interest could be the start of a larger market rally, with liquidity building up to potentially break through resistance levels. Soon after James Wynn’s whale rotation, World Liberty Financial also signaled the same kind of move with a significant purchase of Ethereum. They swapped $2.5 million in WBTC for 770 ETH, further demonstrating the growing shift of institutional capital towards Ethereum. World Liberty Financial’s strategic move to acquire Ethereum is a sign of broader market sentiment that ETH may be ready for further growth on the price charts. On the back of greater institutional participation, this can be seen as a very bullish sign for the altcoin. At the time of writing, Ethereum’s price seemed to be at a critical point, with liquidity clusters forming around the $3,200-$3,400 resistance zone. Source: CoinGlass Failure to break this range could pull the price down back to $3,000. The RSI stood at 61.72, indicating overbought conditions, while the MACD’s readings highlighted positive momentum. Source: TradingView A breakout could propel Ethereum to $3,800, but a reversal is also possible if the resistance holds.

Title: Trump calls for ban on ‘large institutional investors’ buying single-family homes

Skip to comments. Posted on 01/07/2026 9:15:41 PM PST by SeekAndFind President Trump on Wednesday called for a ban on “large institutional investors” buying single-family homes in a bid to address the issue of affordability. “I am immediately taking steps to ban large institutional investors from buying more single-family homes, and I will be calling on Congress to codify it. People live in homes, not corporations,” Trump said in a Truth Social post, adding that he will discuss the topic, including further Housing and Affordability proposals, at the World Economic Forum in Davos later this month. The proposed ban could prove to be a way in for Trump and Republicans to address the issue of affordability ahead of this year’s midterm elections. The president and his Republican allies have struggled to message on the issue as inflation persists and as Democrats have won a number of special and off-year elections by zeroing in on the topic. Several private equity firms and real estate trusts have swept-up up a considerable amount of single-family homes that are then turned around to rent. That has destabilized the homebuying market by reducing supply as well as how it has impacted home prices. In his Truth Social post, the president laid blame on former President Biden for current inflation, which have remained stagnant during Trump’s second-term so far. “For a very long time, buying and owning a home was considered the pinnacle of the American Dream. It was the reward for working hard, and doing the right thing, but now, because of the Record High Inflation caused by Joe Biden and the Democrats in Congress, that American Dream is increasingly out of reach for far too many people, especially younger Americans,” the president noted.

People live in homes, not corporations,” Trump said in a Truth Social post, adding that he will discuss the topic, including further Housing and Affordability proposals, at the World Economic Forum in Davos later this month. The proposed ban could prove to be a way in for Trump and Republicans to address the issue of affordability ahead of this year’s midterm elections. The president and his Republican allies have struggled to message on the issue as inflation persists and as Democrats have won a number of special and off-year elections by zeroing in on the topic. Several private equity firms and real estate trusts have swept-up up a considerable amount of single-family homes that are then turned around to rent. That has destabilized the homebuying market by reducing supply as well as how it has impacted home prices. In his Truth Social post, the president laid blame on former President Biden for current inflation, which have remained stagnant during Trump’s second-term so far. “For a very long time, buying and owning a home was considered the pinnacle of the American Dream. It was the reward for working hard, and doing the right thing, but now, because of the Record High Inflation caused by Joe Biden and the Democrats in Congress, that American Dream is increasingly out of reach for far too many people, especially younger Americans,” the president noted.

BlackRock plays a limited role, primarily through minority stakes in public REITs and real-estate-linked funds, with more recent exposure to build-to-rent developments rather than large-scale home ownership. Blackstone, by contrast, is a central institutional force in single-family rentals. It pioneered the post-2008 buy-to-rent model via Invitation Homes, later acquiring Home Partners of America and Tricon Residential.
