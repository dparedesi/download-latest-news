Bitcoin traders are watching several technical levels. (Photo illustration by Chesnot/Getty Images) Bitcoin traders who leverage technical analysis have been monitoring important levels of support and resistance, singling out $100,000 in particular as being psychologically significant. The world’s most prominent digital currency appears to be following a downward trend since reaching an all-time high of more than $108,000 on December 17, Coinbase data from TradingView reveals. On Monday, December 30, the cryptocurrency fell below $91,500, reaching its lowest level since late November, additional Coinbase figures show. In spite of this recent price activity, bitcoin is still in a strong, upward trend that has propelled it to multiple fresh, all-time highs over the last several months. Several analysts have noted this strong performance, including the TikTok influencer who goes by Wendy O. The market observer emphasized such developments in emailed comments, stating that “We are still in a crypto bull market, even though it feels a bit different than previous cycles and we will see a lot of bullish price action in the crypto markets, primarily with Bitcoin.” “Closing 2024 Bitcoin is currently in a downtrend on the daily chart since hitting all-time high of $108,000 on 12/17/2024,” she noted. “I’m personally watching psychological levels like $100,000 and $90,000. These areas are important as most are not trading full-time and passive investors,” Wendy O clarified. “Those numbers spark excitement.” “When we look at $100,000 as resistance, it seems to be an area the masses may see as a good value to sell, and that could also be why we have been in a downtrend since hitting all-time high of $108,000,” she stated. Further, the analyst emphasized the strong institutional demand stemming from both BlackRock and MicroStrategy, and noted that as countries grow increasingly interested in using bitcoin as a strategic reserve, the digital asset’s price could easily push higher. Joe DiPasquale, CEO of cryptocurrency hedge fund manager BitBull Capital, also weighed in, highlighting several technical levels. “On the downside, support could emerge around the $85,000–$86,000 zone, followed by the $80,000 level, and deeper at $75,000 if the market continues to decline,” he noted via emailed comments. “On the upside, resistance is likely to be encountered near $95,000–$96,000, with the $100,000 mark acting as a significant psychological barrier,” said DiPasquale. “If Bitcoin manages to break above $100,000, the $105,000 area could become the next key resistance level,” he pointed out. “Traders should also monitor volume around these levels to gauge the strength of any price action, while broader macroeconomic factors and sentiment will play a crucial role in shaping Bitcoin’s medium-to-long-term direction,” the analyst emphasized. Tim Enneking, managing partner of Psalion, offered a different point of view. “Bitcoin has been truly range-bound, while showing more action to the downside, since December 20, three days after the most recent ATH,” he stated via email. “Counting today, it’s bounced off the $92k area three times. That level is also the bottom of a channel which started in November 2022, which has provided major support in the past (although not without fail),” said Enneking. “If $90k breaks, and the odds are about even that it will, there is some support of $88k, but the next bottom will probably be lower (although almost certainly still with an ‘8’ handle),” he stated. “By the time that plays out, inauguration euphoria will probably kick in with Bitcoiners licking their chops at the prospect of a pro-crypto administration and BTC turning into a reserve asset (N.B. Not a reserve currency) – and BTC will be primed for the next ATH,” Enneking predicted. Disclosure: I own some bitcoin, bitcoin cash, litecoin, ether, EOS and SOL. One Community. Many Voices.

Title: How has the 21st century gone so wrong?

The Nasdaq had reached 4000, a nearly sixfold increase in seven years. Unemployment in the world’s largest economy had shrunk to 3 per cent, the lowest in more than a generation. Having borne the burden of the Cold War, the American people were reaping the peace dividend. Xi Jinping, Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin all seek radical change to the current world order.Credit: AP In other countries, the news was equally bright. The Europeans had introduced both a single market and a single currency and were well on their way to becoming a “United States of Europe”. The once-mighty communist international had dwindled to Cuba, North Korea and a few university departments. World trade in manufactured goods had doubled in the 1990s and would double again in the 2000s. Global poverty was receding faster than ever. A quarter of a century later, the mood could not be more different. A sizeable majority of the global population – three in five people – believe the world is getting worse. This is as true in traditionally optimistic America (which has just elected an irascible 78-year-old to succeed a faltering 82-year-old) as it is in stagnating Europe. The world’s second-biggest economy, China, is run by a proud Marxist-Leninist, Xi Jinping, whose achievements include removing limits on his time in power. The world’s most populous country, India, is in the hands of an illiberal strongman, Narendra Modi. China and Russia have built an axis of authoritarian states that are determined to push back against Western liberalism. Vladimir Putin’s “war on the West” has involved not just the invasion of Crimea and Ukraine and the dispatching of private militia across Africa, but numerous sorties, by plane and submarine, into Western territory. Xi has declared that any foreign power that tries to “bully, oppress, or enslave us” will “be battered and blooded from colliding with a great wall of steel forged by more than 1.4 billion Chinese people using flesh and blood”. In the 1990s, we looked forward to a world of entrepreneurial vigour, public sector discipline and spreading peace. Optimists might point out that the first quarter of the 21st century has been better than the first quarter of the 20th, when the Great War took the lives of 15 million people and provided the material for both communism and fascism, not to mention World War II. But the contrast with the optimism of the 1990s is nevertheless astonishing. And worse is almost certain to come. Some security officials believe we are engaged in an undeclared war with the “axis of autocracy”. Donald Trump, elected with a clear majority, has hinted he will pursue a policy of America First and may well destroy the institutions that undergirded postwar security. The EU is in a state of paralysis, with the leaders of the two most powerful countries, France’s Emmanuel Macron and Germany’s Olaf Scholz, discredited and their economies stagnant. And tens of millions of people are likely to flee Africa and Latin America in coming years, driven by a combination of economic stagnation, political fragility and climate change, empowering the far right and undermining the stability of the West. As for the miracle of technology, one survey of AI researchers discovered that 48 per cent thought there was at least a 10 per cent chance that its impact would be “extremely bad”, that is, lead to human extinction. What has gone wrong with the 21st century? Let’s start by acknowledging that there have been successes. We have created an entire virtual world. Today, more than half the world’s population has some sort of internet access, and there are about as many mobile phones in the world as people – 8 billion-plus. This has ushered in a world of information and entertainment that never existed. There are more than a billion fewer people living on less than $US2.25 a day than there were in 2000, thanks to catch-up growth in developing countries. In 2012-13, the global poverty headcount fell by 130 million people, marking it as one of the most remarkable years in history. In December 2020, China declared it had eliminated extreme poverty completely. Yet even these positives contain negatives. The information revolution has undermined the business models of “old media” companies that put a premium on checking facts while, at the same time, empowering rumourmongers who depend on polarisation and misinformation. There has been no significant impact in reducing global poverty in the decade since 2015.Credit: Getty Images The spread of smartphones has coincided with the spread of psychological problems, particularly among the young. The war against poverty is going into reverse. In China, economic growth has slowed to a crawl. In Latin America and Africa, poverty rates are again rising, thanks to economic stagnation, political instability and rapid population growth. In all, the number of people living in absolute poverty has barely declined since 2015. The West has made a succession of policy errors that both weakened its elites and emboldened its autocratic critics. George W Bush invaded Iraq based on false information and then bungled the occupation. Angela Merkel, Germany’s powerful chancellor from 2005 to 2021, failed to address her country’s two biggest weaknesses: its dependence on Russian energy supplies and its failure to invest in its own defences. In the UK, David Cameron dealt with a feud within the Conservative Party by holding a popular referendum on Britain’s membership of the EU, plunging the country into chaos and reducing its economic growth rate. The world has also lived through the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, which deepened the growing sense of economic injustice and paved the way for the rise of populism. The problem lies with more than just a handful of policy mistakes. It lies with the broader development of the global economy-cum-polity. In the 1990s, we looked forward to a world of entrepreneurial vigour, public sector discipline and spreading peace. What we got was the very opposite: oligopoly, government splurge and militarised blocs. The consolidation of capitalism is most advanced in the US, the leading economic power, and in tech and finance, suggesting that oligopoly is the way of the future. Five tech companies are each worth more than $US1 trillion ($1.6 trillion), and one, Apple, is worth more than $US3 trillion. Three big investment houses, BlackRock, the Vanguard Group and State Street, collectively manage around $US22 trillion in assets. Over the past two decades, industries have grown more concentrated. This may be the result of excellence: Google and Apple are superbly run, and Microsoft is undergoing a renaissance after a period in the doldrums. But would anyone argue that America’s airline industry is a model of innovation and customer service? The success of the superstar companies slows the rate of innovation and thwarts competition; the success of second-rate companies contributes to a general sense of frustration. It’s notable that the world’s first great age of populism, before World War I, coincided with the rise of giant companies, particularly in the US and Germany. Bill Clinton’s pronouncement in 1996 that the era of big government was “over” has proved hollow.Credit: AP Meanwhile, Clinton’s pronouncement in another State of the Union Address, in 1996, that the era of big government was “over” has proved hollow. Americans tax themselves like a small-government country but behave like a big-government one. The US deficit is roughly 6 per cent of GDP, twice the average of recent decades and the US government stepped in to save failing companies such as Citigroup and General Motors in 2008. The situation is worse in the EU, where government sprawl is not balanced by economic vigour. European countries spend beyond their means on welfare while the bureaucracy in Brussels prides itself on its role as “regulatory giant” rather than its ability to ignite growth. Putin put paid to talk of the “peace dividend” with his invasion of Crimea in 2014 and Ukraine in 2022. But, in truth, the most serious threat to the global order comes from China, which has an economy 10 times the size of Russia and a much more disciplined leadership. From its admission into the World Trade Organisation in 2000, but gathering pace with the rise of Xi to the top job in 2013, China poured a portion of the “globalisation dividend” into building up its military might. China’s navy is the biggest in the world, and its nuclear arsenal may reach 1000 warheads by 2030, according to the US Department of Defence. It is also roaring ahead in tech. China has overtaken the West in hypersonic missiles – those capable of travelling at five times the speed of sound and evading air defences – and is pioneering lasers, orbiting space robots and high-altitude balloons. What are the chances that the next 25 years will be better than the last? The 21st century has seen the two most compelling ideologies of the 1990s malfunction horrendously. These are neo-liberalism, the belief that, overall, markets are more efficient than governments in organising economic life, and neo-conservatism, what started as a corrective to the left’s overconfidence in the power of the state to fix everything. The great danger in coming years is that we will see the further decline of a third ideology: liberalism. Across the West, liberal leaders are flailing. Kamala Harris decisively lost to a candidate who has broken one of the most important liberal rules: giving up power graciously when you lose an election. The two most flamboyant liberal politicians of the past decade – Macron in France and Justin Trudeau in Canada – are flailing. Keir Starmer won a landslide election victory in the UK on the promise of reviving the pragmatic centre only to make a mess of governing. Liberal elites have prepared the way for a populist backlash by a combination of commission and omission. They have fixated on cultural issues such as pronouns at a time when regular people are suffering from stagnant living standards. They have betrayed the principle of race-blind meritocracy by embracing race-conscious policies. And they have paid too little attention to growing worries about immigration even as expanding populations put pressure on housing and public services. The result has been to cede ground to populists such as Trump, Nigel Farage in Britain and Marine Le Pen in France. Which future we choose depends, above all, on whether liberals can once again revitalise their beliefs. There are some reasons for optimism about the future. The AI revolution has the potential to cut administrative costs while giving everyone the equivalent of a smart assistant. The collapse of Bashar al-Assad’s regime in Syria is a serious setback for the “axis of autocracy”, reducing Russia’s influence in the Middle East and suggesting that even the most vicious dictators can be overthrown. The Republicans’ triumph in 2024 could prove self-correcting, creating opportunities for a new generation of middle-of-the-road Democrats. Yet all this potential could go the other way. AI may destroy the jobs of millions of knowledge workers, creating a radicalised middle class, while handing more power to a few tech giants. A newly liberated Syria may break up into warring territories or fall into the hands of Islamic extremists. Trump and his allies may well destroy the rules-based international order that has largely kept the peace since 1945. An intriguing study of 120 years of populist governments suggests that the most common reaction to the failure of populism is for voters to demand yet more populism. Which future we choose depends, above all, on whether liberals can once again revitalise their beliefs or whether they will continue to drift and dither. Can they address the causes of populism, or will they continue to repeat empty phrases? Can they think like regular people, or will they continue to act like members of a global elite? Can they adapt classic liberal ideas about open competition and freedom of speech to radically new circumstances? What happens this next quarter-century depends on how well we answer these questions.

Title: Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc. (ODFL): Are Hedge Funds Bullish On This Logistics Stock Right Now?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 11 Best Logistics Stocks to Invest in Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc. (NASDAQ:ODFL) stands against the other logistics stocks. Logistics companies transporting goods around the world continue to navigate uncertainty as Donald Trump plans to impose 60% tariffs on goods from China and 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada. As reported by CNBC, Dave Bozeman, the new CEO of C.H. Robinson, sees an opportunity in Trump tariffs. The logistics giant is a top 3 carrier on the China-U.S. freight lane also carrying nearly 10% of the freight on the US-Mexico lane. Citi transportation analyst Ari Rosa considers the company’s business diversified enough to work through tariffs despite its global forwarding business being very exposed to China. The CEO’s stance on the tariffs was quite positive as well, as he stated: “The freight still has to move. It might just move at a different starting point, and we would still be there to move that.” In an interview with CNBC, Ravi Jakhar of the firm Allcargo Group, the world’s LCL consolidation leader and India’s largest integrated logistics solutions provider, reiterated optimism regarding the Trump tariff risks. He mentioned how over 4 years ago when sanctions came in from the Trump administration, the firm saw an increased import into its Vietnam offices from China and improved export out of Vietnam, alongside increased momentum in Indonesia and the Philippines. In his opinion, whether it is a short-term tariff sanction or a long-term structural trend, trade flows could change in terms of origins and destinations but the overall trade flows would remain robust as long as manufacturing and consumption are there. As of what’s recent in the logistics landscape, the holiday season is in full swing, with holiday surcharges playing a crucial role in profitability for logistics companies since they charge their big retail customers extra fees on a per-package basis compared to their June volume during the busy holiday season. The increase in e-commerce is also benefitting such logistics providers and full truckload carriers. Simultaneously, an increase in freight in anticipation of future tariffs is also being seen. A survey from Merchants Fleet and Atomik Research of decision-makers in organizations that typically transport freights of consumer-packaged goods throughout the US revealed that 88% saw AI as useful in alleviating pressures on their fleets this peak delivery season. AI’s data-driven capabilities are to streamline operations and decision-making, with the majority of the respondents citing supply chain optimization as a primary benefit. Other advantages mentioned were improved route optimization, enhanced inventory management, and reduced downtime by identifying maintenance issues with fleet vehicles. Our Methodology: In order to compile a list of the 11 best logistics stocks to invest in right now, we went through stock screeners, ETFs, and media reports to make a list of relevant stocks. Moving on, we shortlisted the top 11 stocks from our list which had the highest number of hedge fund holders. The 11 best logistics stocks to invest in right now have been arranged in ascending order of their hedge fund holders as of Q3 2024.

The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A large fleet of freight trucks travelling down an interstate highway. Number of Hedge Funds: 38 Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc. (NASDAQ:ODFL) is one of the largest North American less-than-truckload motor carriers. The firm offers regional, inter-regional and national LTL services through a single integrated, union-free organization. ODFL also offers a range of value-added services including container drayage, truckload brokerage and supply chain consulting, other than its core LTL services. The firm is a leading national LTL carrier, with third-party data validating its value proposition and opportunities for market share growth. The market share opportunity for Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc. (NASDAQ:ODFL) in the LTL market stays massive. The company is not just the leading but is deemed the best-positioned LTL carrier, with a solid history of significant revenue growth and profitability, superior customer service delivered at a fair price, ongoing opportunity to win market share, as well as an experienced and motivated team. Furthermore, Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc. (NASDAQ:ODFL) continues to invest to keep moving forward, building on the aforementioned progress. The firm made significant real estate purchases from 2014 to 2023 of $2.1 billion to expand and improve the service center network. The capacity to grow supported by an unmatched investment in its network and equipment further reiterates the firm’s strong positioning. Overall ODFL ranks 8th on our list of the best logistics stocks to invest in right now. While we acknowledge the potential of ODFL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Title: NICE Ltd. (NICE) Downgraded: What Does CEO Transition Mean for Growth?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 AI News Investors Probably Missed. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NICE Ltd. (NASDAQ:NICE) stands against the other AI stocks. A December 30 report by CNBC discussed the rapid adoption of generative AI by businesses, its potential to significantly impact global GDP, and the varying perspectives of leaders on its future. As per the report, generative AI has evolved from a novelty to a key tool for businesses, with nearly two-thirds of organizations using it for tasks like customer service automation and data analysis. While its growth could potentially boost global GDP by $7 trillion in the next decade, opinions among business leaders vary. Jamie Dimon and Bill Gates view AI as transformative, comparing it to past technological breakthroughs. However, Sundar Pichai and Satya Nadella caution that further advancements will be slower, requiring deep innovation. Meanwhile, concerns about AI's ethical risks, highlighted by Warren Buffett and Mark Cuban, suggest the technology could have unintended consequences, despite its growing importance in industries like defense. READ ALSO: 9 Important AI News and Ratings on Investors' Radar and 10 AI News Investors Shouldn't Miss. CNBC’s TechCheck anchor, Deirdre Bosa reported on December 30 that DeepSeek, an open-source AI model developed by a Chinese research lab, has emerged as a serious competitor to leading models like GPT-4 and LLaMA 3.1. Despite using lower-cost H800 chips, which are less powerful versions of the H100, DeepSeek outperformed these models in key benchmarks and was built for just $5.5 million, a fraction of the cost of other frontier models that require hundreds of millions or even billions to develop. This signals a shift toward more commoditized AI models, where progress relies less on building new infrastructure and more on optimizing existing models. The development raises concerns for investors in major U.S. tech companies, as it challenges the long-standing dominance of firms like OpenAI. Additionally, the success of DeepSeek highlights the potential advantage of open-source models, suggesting that nations like China, without access to the latest chips or massive investments, could still compete effectively in the AI race, Bosa mentioned. The implications of this development, particularly for the U.S.-led AI dominance and global geopolitical dynamics are expected to unfold further in 2025. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

On December 19, Jefferies downgraded NICE (NASDAQ:NICE) from Buy to Hold, citing factors such as a CEO transition, slower-than-expected cloud growth for 2025, and heightened competition. The firm reduced its price target to $200 from $215. Incoming CEO Scott Russell, formerly of SAP, has received positive feedback, but Jefferies sees potential risks from the departure of long-time CEO Barak Eilam. Analyst Samad Samana forecasted 2025 cloud revenue growth at 15%, below the 16.6% consensus, and noted increasing competition in the CCaaS market from incumbents, large software vendors, and hyperscalers introducing GenAI tools.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 13 Best Pharma Dividend Stocks To Buy In 2024. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) stands against the other pharma dividend stocks. The pharmaceutical industry in 2024 faced a relatively quiet year, with deal volumes similar to 2023 but lower deal values, reflecting a shift toward smaller, more strategic transactions. Despite challenges such as patent expirations and market uncertainty, innovation remains strong, and there is a better investment environment for biotech. Lower interest rates have also eased capital costs, contributing to increased mergers and acquisitions activity. Biotech IPOs and venture capital investments are seeing a slight recovery, though investment is more concentrated in established companies. However, major pharmaceutical companies face a $300 billion growth gap due to patent expirations, making dealmaking crucial for future growth. Looking ahead to 2025, EY believes that the pharmaceutical sector is expected to see more deal activity, especially if interest rates remain low. There may be a rise in larger acquisitions to address growth gaps, although smaller, strategic deals are likely to persist. Politically, the US policy environment is shifting with potential impacts on business, including lower corporate taxes and deregulation, but also the possibility of higher tariffs and continued drug pricing reforms. Changes in immigration and leadership within health agencies could also affect the pharmaceutical and biotech industries, with new appointees potentially disrupting the regulatory landscape. As executives prepare for 2025, drug pricing and access remain their top concerns, according to a Deloitte survey. The survey highlighted that primary concerns include competition from generic drugs and biosimilars and the looming patent cliff, with over $300 billion in sales at risk due to expiring patents by 2030. This has executives expecting a surge in mergers and acquisitions in 2025. Innovation remains at the forefront as companies look to fill gaps left by expiring patents. However, competition in profitable areas like oncology and immunology is fierce, leading to price pressures even before generics or biosimilars hit the market. On the flip side, the success of GLP-1 receptor agonists is sparking renewed interest in general medicines, with companies racing to tap into the $200 billion market. Additionally, about 20% of companies are adjusting their portfolios to focus on high-potential candidates and better meet market demands. Advanced therapies like cell and gene therapies are also gaining attention, with a shift away from more traditional drugs. In addition to the competitive landscape, life sciences companies are also keeping a close eye on regulatory changes. In the United States, concerns about the Inflation Reduction Act are growing, while in Europe, shifts in clinical trial regulations could add complexity. As a result, life sciences companies are preparing for a year of both innovation-driven growth and regulatory challenges. Our Methodology In this article, we reviewed Insider Monkey's Q3 2024 database to identify pharmaceutical dividend stocks that hedge funds favored the most. The companies listed below are ranked in ascending order based on the number of hedge fund holders in each firm. At Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here) A close-up of a person's hand holding a bottle of pharmaceuticals. Dividend Yield as of December 28: 3.30% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 86 Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) is a global healthcare company operating through two segments – Pharmaceutical and Animal Health. The Pharmaceutical segment offers a range of human health products, including treatments for oncology, immunology, neuroscience, virology, cardiovascular conditions, and diabetes, under well-known brands like Keytruda, Januvia, and Bridion. It also provides vaccines for various age groups under brands such as Gardasil and Pneumovax. Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) has recently partnered with the Chinese biopharma company Hansoh to develop an oral GLP-1 receptor agonist for treating metabolic conditions and obesity, entering a market dominated by Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk. Despite strong performances in oncology and vaccines, Merck’s stock has fallen 20% over the past six months. The licensing deal with Hansoh includes a $112 million upfront payment and up to $1.9 billion in royalties and milestones. Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) reported $16.7 billion in total revenues, a 4% increase, or 7% excluding foreign exchange effects. The human health business grew 8%, driven by oncology, while the Animal Health business saw an 11% sales increase. Key oncology product KEYTRUDA grew 21% to $7.4 billion, fueled by expanded use in both early and metastatic cancers. Lynparza revenue grew 13%, while sales of WELIREG more than doubled. GARDASIL sales decreased 10%, primarily due to a decline in China, though global sales increased in other regions. Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK)’s full-year earnings guidance has been adjusted to $7.72 to $7.77 per share, factoring in foreign exchange and business developments. The company remains focused on innovation, dividend growth, and pursuing strategic acquisitions. On November 19, Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) announced a quarterly dividend of $0.81 per share, a 5.2% increase from its prior dividend of $0.77. The dividend is distributable on January 8, 2025, to shareholders on record as of December 16. Insider Monkey’s Q3 database shows that Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) was held by 86 hedge funds, compared to 96 funds in the last quarter. Ken Griffin’s Citadel Investment Group is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with a position worth nearly $800 million. Overall MRK ranks 3rd on our list of the best pharma dividend stocks to buy in 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of MRK as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MRK but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Bank regulator gives BlackRock January deadline on bank stakes

By Suzanne McGee (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has told asset manager BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) it has until Jan. 10 to accept an agreement that would allow the agency to step up scrutiny of its investments in FDIC-regulated banking institutions, according to a person familiar with the matter. On Friday, the FDIC said it reached a similar deal with Vanguard strengthening the rules the asset manager must observe as a passive investor in FDIC-supervised banks, the latest step in a months-long tug-of-war between the banking regulator and the two biggest managers of index-based mutual funds and exchange-traded funds. The FDIC is pushing both firms to adopt "passivity agreements," which provide the regulator with more tools to monitor compliance on the part of the asset managers with pledges not to influence the business decisions of the FDIC-regulated banks in which they invest. The individual familiar with the state of the negotiations between BlackRock and the FDIC said the firm received the regulator's latest proposal on Friday, less than an hour after the announcement of the Vanguard agreement. That source said the wording of the proposed agreement is "substantively the same" as that of the Vanguard pact. The FDIC declined to comment on the Vanguard agreement or the negotiations with BlackRock. "We know that chief executive officers and board members of large companies carefully watch the policy pronouncements of these mega-owners," said Rohit Chopra, director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and a member of the FDIC board, in a statement released on Monday. "If a large asset manager is truly passive as it claims, it should have no problem complying" with the kind of passivity agreement the FDIC is seeking, Chopra said. In a public comment letter submitted to the FDIC in October, BlackRock said it already makes legally binding commitments to the Federal Reserve Board to remain a passive investor in U.S. banks. "BlackRock does not exercise control over FDIC-supervised institutions, nor does it seek to," Benjamin Tecmire, head of regulatory affairs, said in the letter. The FDIC has not stated what consequences might follow if BlackRock does not meet the Jan. 10 deadline.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Pot Stocks To Invest In According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where GrowGeneration Corp. (NASDAQ:GRWG) stands against other pot stocks to buy according to analysts. The global marijuana market is growing and the market for legal cannabis is expected to rise at a CAGR of 25.7% and reach $102.2 billion by 2030, according to Grand View Research. Despite regulatory limitations, the cannabis industry is getting attention from investors, suppliers, and researchers. If we want to know how hedge funds feel about pot stocks, we recently covered 11 Best Cannabis Stocks To Invest In according to hedge fund sentiment. A total of 38 states and the District of Columbia have legalized marijuana for medicinal use. In addition, 24 states and the District of Columbia allow cannabis for adults’ recreational use. As the push for legalization continues to grow, more people are accepting the idea of legalizing marijuana across the US. The US is the leading country with the highest weed consumption in the world. If you want to know where most weed is consumed in the US (See Here: 30 Cities with the Highest Weed Consumption in the US). The American legal cannabis industry experienced notable growth in 2023 as legal sales across the US were $28.8 billion, up by 10.3% year-over-year. Consequently, the legal cannabis market added 22,952 new jobs in 2023, reflecting a better business atmosphere, especially in the cannabis industry. In 2024, the legal cannabis industry supported over 440,445 jobs, an increase of 5.4% from 2023, as per the 2024 Vangst Jobs Report. The major driver for the cannabis industry remains the rising demand for its use for medical purposes. In the coming years, new markets are expected to fuel growth in the cannabis industry. One such example is Nebraska’s vote in favour of legalizing medical marijuana last month. As we write this article, 24 states have legalized recreational weed in America, in addition to the District of Columbia. However, selling or possessing marijuana remains a crime under federal law. In November, Florida voters rejected a ballot measure to legalize recreational marijuana, which was a major setback for the legal cannabis industry in the US. Amendment 3 fell short of the required 60% threshold for legalization, despite historic funding levels and an endorsement from President-elect Donald Trump. Florida remains home to the country’s largest medical marijuana market, adding around $2 billion in annual revenue. Amendment 3 could have boosted the cannabis market to a projected $6 billion by 2026. Florida voters will have to wait for two more years until cannabis legalization gets back on the ballot. Florida has disappointed cannabis investors and consumers and it has had an impact on cannabis stocks. One of the first cannabis ETFs, Amplify Alternative Harvest ETF, has plunged over 45% since November 4, as of December 23. ​​You can also visit and see 12 Cheap Chinese Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.

Title: Dungeons & Dragons causes controversy with rule change over identity

Fox News Insider "Races" are now "species" in the beloved game Dungeons & Dragons, which recently marked its 50th anniversary, irking some loyal fans. "Some character traits have been divorced from biological identity; a mountain dwarf is no longer inherently brawny and durable, a high elf no longer intelligent and dexterous by definition," a report in The New York Times explains. "And Wizards of the Coast, the Dungeons & Dragons publisher owned by Hasbro, has endorsed a trend throughout role-playing games in which players are empowered to halt the proceedings if they ever feel uncomfortable." The company also now suggests that extended Dungeons & Dragons campaigns begin with sessions allowing players to lay out their expectations and which topics they wish to avoid, which could include sexual assault or drug use, the Times writes. "What they’re trying to do here is put up a signal flare, to not only current players but potential future players, that this game is a safe, inclusive, thoughtful and sensitive approach to fantasy storytelling," said Ryan Lessard, a writer and frequent Dungeons & Dragons dungeon master, according to the report. ENTERTAINMENT INSIDER SAYS ESG FUNDING IS WHY WOKE ENTERTAINMENT KEEPS GETTING MADE DESPITE LOSING AUDIENCES Chris Pine, star of the "Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves" movie. (Axelle/Bauer-Griffin/FilmMagic/Getty Images) But some gamers are frustrated. "It’s an unnecessary thing," Robert J. Kuntz, an award-winning game designer who frequently collaborated with Gary Gygax, a co-creator of Dungeons & Dragons, told the Times. "It attempts to play into something that I’m not sure is even worthy of addressing, as if the word ‘race’ is bad." AP UNDER FIRE AFTER OLYMPIC BOXER WHO FAILED GENDER TEST NAMED AMONG ‘FEMALE ATHLETES OF THE YEAR’ Wizards of the Coast executives defended the new rules by saying players desired greater leeway in creating their characters. But some have slammed the attempt at a more "inclusive" game that some argue comes at the expense of the game's authenticity. Darren Kent on the "Dungeons & Dragons" red carpet. (Carey Dodd Associates) BLACKROCK ADMITS ESG ADVOCACY COULD PROVE BAD FOR BUSINESS In an X thread about the new Wizards of the Coast Players Handbook and Dungeon Master's Guide that analyzed D&D’s origins in the 1970s, users blasted WoTC and Hasbro for distancing themselves from the game's original creators due to their apparent insensitivites. The foreword claims the original role-playing game largely excluded women or portrayed them "disrespectfully," and portrayed slavery "not as a human tragedy but as a commercial transaction." "Wizards of the woke," one X user said in response to the passage. X owner Elon Musk weighed in with an even blunter message. "Nobody, and I mean nobody, gets to trash E. Gary Gygax and the geniuses who created Dungeons & Dragons," he wrote. "What the f--- is wrong with Hasbro and WoTC?? May they burn in hell." Musk also weighed in on a passage Babylon Bee editor Kyle Mann highlighted in which players in the game's latest iteration are encouraged to signal if they are triggered by any of the game's content. "Wtf," Musk simply replied. Fox News Digital reached out to Hasbro for comment. Mark Kern, a former team lead of "World of Warcraft," recently weighed in on how the video game industry and entertainment at large cater to progressive views in their content in exchange for access to money. One consultant agency, Sweet Baby Inc., for instance, described itself as an "inclusion-focused narrative and consultation company" working toward "diversifying and enriching the video games industry." "There is a coordinated effort to insert diversity politics into games by ALL parties involved to the detriment of the quality of the games themselves. Sweet Baby’s Inc.’s very public and self published involvement is just the tip of the iceberg," Kern told Fox News Digital.

Title: Chopra: Regulators Must Do More to Ensure Investment Managers Aren’t ‘Improperly Influencing’ Banks

Time Published: 2024-12-30T21:44:43Z

Recent steps taken by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) will help ensure that fund managers are not “improperly influencing” decisions made by FDIC-supervised banks, Rohit Chopra, member of the FDIC board of directors and director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) said in a Monday (Dec. 30) statement. Chopra said in the statement that very large investment managers like BlackRock and Vanguard own stakes both in commercial enterprises and in banks and that these firms often characterize their involvement with these companies as “passive.” “However, we know that chief executive officers and board members of large companies carefully watch the policy pronouncements of these mega-owners,” Chopra said. “If these firms are not truly ‘passive,’ they may be in violation of longstanding statutes, including those relating to banking.” Chopra’s statement came after the Friday (Dec. 27) release of an amended advisory opinion by the FDIC, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, saying that large “passive” asset managers may not have a representative on the board of directors of a bank in which they have a significant ownership stake. In addition, the FDIC said Friday that it entered into an investor passivity agreement with Vanguard in which the agency has advanced tools to ensure that the company remains passive in terms of its ownership stake in FDIC-insured banks. Reached by PYMNTS, Vanguard said in an emailed statement that the agreement is part of its ongoing commitment to passive investing. “Vanguard is built around passive investing and has long been committed to working constructively with policymakers to ensure that passive means passive,” the statement said. “This agreement with the FDIC is another example and recognition of that ongoing commitment.” BlackRock did not immediately reply to PYMNTS’ request for comment. In his Monday statement, Chopra said the steps taken by the FDIC are “small, but significant” and advance the goal of ensuring that fund managers are not “improperly influencing” FDIC-supervised banks. “Agencies across government charged with safeguarding critical sectors of the economy from conflicts of interest and anticompetitive conduct will need to take further steps with respect to these large investment managers,” Chopra said. We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

Dividend Yield as of December 28: 3.61% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 68 Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) develops and delivers human therapeutics globally. Its key products address conditions like psoriasis, osteoporosis, cardiovascular risks, cancer, and anemia. Amgen is particularly appealing due to its undervaluation and strong pipeline, including the experimental obesity drug MariTide, which could significantly boost its valuation. Even without MariTide’s success, Amgen’s intrinsic value remains solid. This favorable risk/reward dynamic, combined with its strong fundamentals, makes Amgen a compelling choice, with the potential for significant upside as the pharma sector stabilizes. Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) is also 8th on our list of the best dividend stocks. Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) reported strong Q3 results with a 23% revenue increase to $8.5 billion, driven by double-digit growth in 10 products. Key drivers included a 17% rise in oncology sales, a 21% increase in rare disease sales, and a 67% growth in TEZSPIRE for severe asthma. Repatha and EVENITY also showed strong performance in general medicine. The company’s pipeline progress, particularly with the obesity drug MariTide, positions it for long-term growth. Biosimilars also performed well, with a 9% sales increase. Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) returned capital to shareholders with a 6% increase in its dividend, paying $2.25 per share in Q2. For 2024, the company expects total revenues between $33.0 billion and $33.8 billion, with non-GAAP EPS ranging from $19.20 to $20. Q4 non-GAAP EPS is expected to be lower than Q3 due to planned investments in key assets like MariTide and olpasiran, as well as other strategic initiatives. According to Insider Monkey’s Q3 database, Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) was found in 68 public stock portfolios, compared to 69 in the last quarter. Two Sigma Advisors is one of the most prominent stakeholders of the company. Overall AMGN ranks 8th on our list of the best pharma dividend stocks to buy in 2024.

Fidelity has lifted its valuation of two Elon Musk-controlled tech companies even higher, according to recent filings. This was the second month in a row that the mutual-fund giant raised the value of its stakes in xAI and the social-media platform X, the filings show. The Fidelity Blue Chip Growth Fund valued its xAI shares at $79,857,865 at the end of November, a monthly report posted at the end of December said. That's a 6.4% increase from October, when the fund valued its stake in xAI at $75,062,706, and an increase from September, when the value was $44,152,362. The fund's annual report, published at the end of September, said that at the end of July it owned 3,688,585 xAI shares, which were acquired on May 13 for $44,152,000. However, xAI recently closed a hotly anticipated funding round that Fidelity participated in alongside A16z, BlackRock, Kingdom Holding, Lightspeed, and other investors. xAI confirmed the $6 billion round in a blog post on December 23. It's unclear how many shares of xAI the Blue Chip Growth Fund has now, but previous filings showed that the price from September to October rose to $20.35 a pop from $11.96. Fidelity's Blue Chip Growth Fund also increased the value of its shares in X in November to $5,797,734, according to the filings. That's about a 5% increase from October, when shares were valued at $5,530,358, and a 39% increase from September, when Fidelity valued its stake in X at $4,185,614. Musk's 2022 acquisition was panned as one of the most overvalued tech acquisitions in recent memory. But the deal has provided significant benefits for Musk. After using X to support Donald Trump's reelection, he's set to wield considerable influence in the incoming Trump administration. X has also been a lucrative source of training data for xAI, which has used content on the social-media platform to develop powerful AI models that compete with similar offerings from OpenAI, Google and other tech companies. But the X deal still hasn't worked out that well for investors, at least not yet. Despite two straight months of increases, Fidelity still values its X stake far lower than it did in late 2022, when Musk purchased X for $44 billion. Earlier filings indicate Fidelity's Blue Chip Growth Fund at the time invested $19.66 million. Representatives for Fidelity declined to comment on Monday. Representatives for X and Musk did not respond to requests for comment. Correction: December 31, 2024 — An earlier version of this story mistakenly reported the number of times in a row that Fidelity has increased the value of its stake in xAI and X. The correct number is two months in a row. Jump to

Title: Report: BlackRock’s Record ETF Offering Helped Bitcoin Hit $100K
URL: https://www.pymnts.com/blockchain/bitcoin/2024/blackrock-record-etf-offering-helped-bitcoin-hit-100000-dollars/
Time Published: 2024-12-30T20:18:43Z

BlackRock’s bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) is reportedly a record-breaker, in more ways than one. The company’s iShares unit offers 1,400-plus ETFs, including its Bitcoin Trust, which launched this year, Bloomberg reported Monday, (Dec. 30). That trust, known as IBIT, now has more than $50 billion in assets, the strongest debut ever for an ETF, and the size of more than 50 European market-focused ETFs put together. “IBIT’s growth is unprecedented. It’s the fastest ETF to reach most milestones, faster than any other ETF in any asset class,” said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart, per the report, adding that — at the current asset level and an expense ratio of 0.25% — IBIT can expect to earn around $112 million per year. IBIT’s success goes beyond BlackRock and helped mark a turning point for bitcoin, according to the report. BlackRock — the world’s largest investment firm — has more than $11 trillion in assets under management, so its embrace of bitcoin ETFs helped push the cryptocurrency’s price above $100,000 for the first time, the report said. This year began with the Securities and Exchange Commission approving bitcoin ETFs after years of opposing the idea. The move was cheered by figures throughout the cryptocurrency sector, including Sui Chung, CEO of Kraken-owned CF Benchmarks. “A spot ETF has always been important because it stands to open bitcoin up to a much broader swathe of investors,” Chung said in a statement to PYMNTS at the time. “We look forward to working with asset-allocators as they incorporate this new asset class into their portfolios and models, significantly increasing the number of investors who could have BTC exposure.” Coinbase, meanwhile, called the approval a “watershed moment for the crypto economy” on its company blog, saying the ETFs “will help catalyze further growth and innovation and expand the size and breadth of crypto markets.” This year has been momentous for cryptocurrency. “The changes of 2024 laid the groundwork for a more resilient and integrated crypto ecosystem,” PYMNTS wrote last week. “Regulatory clarity, technological advancements and growing institutional interest signaled that the industry was entering a new phase of maturity. However, achieving mainstream adoption will require continued innovation, collaboration and a commitment to addressing the challenges that remain.” We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

Title: Ethereum Price Declines Despite Record Staking And ETF Activity
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/ethereum-price-declines-despite-record-staking-and-etf-activity/
Time Published: 2024-12-30T20:00:09Z

Recent Ethereum market swings have revealed an interesting disparity between price and network activity. Staking activity has kept rising while ETH retreated to $3,400, a 16% drop from its December peak. Due to investors staking record amounts of ETH, the total staked assets have exceeded expectations. Even while short-term price fluctuations have led some to doubt Ethereum’s viability, this surge in staking is a sign of growing confidence in the cryptocurrency’s long-term worth. Another significant development is the increase in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that are concentrated on Ethereum. The net total of $2.68 billion has been amassed over the past 25 days, with ETF inflows recorded on 23 days. On December 27, the total net assets of ETFs exceeded $12 billion as a result of the nearly $48 million in daily inflows, data from SoSoValue shows. The Ethereum ETF offered by BlackRock has garnered the majority of these investments, underscoring the institutional interest in ETH in defiance of the recent price decline. The popularity of Ethereum spot ETF reflects the larger crypto market, in which ETFs are starting to be a preferred choice for both institutional and ordinary investors. On the other hand, significant inflows of Bitcoin ETFs in recent months suggest that traditional financial markets are progressively welcoming digital assets. Ethereum’s price decline, on the other hand, illuminates an alternative narrative. Ether’s price drop is likely to be driven by profit-taking following its recent rally and broader macroeconomic uncertainties, as the cryptocurrency market remains volatile. Regulatory pressures and concerns about the likelihood of another interest rate rise have accentuated the cautious mentality of traders. Despite the slump, some analysts see this as a time of consolidation rather than cause for worry. They note that Ethereum’s staking and ETF inflows are strong markers of long-term market confidence. Ethereum’s most recent advancements occur amid an atmosphere of optimism regarding its ecosystem. Continued attention is being drawn to recent enhancements, such as the transition to proof-of-stake and ongoing scalability improvements. These developments are enabling Ethereum to preserve its leadership in non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and decentralized finance (DeFi). It’s important for investors to keep a long-term view while also being able to handle short-term fluctuations. The changing nature of crypto investing can be seen in the growing use of ETFs and staking. The price of Ethereum may go up and down, but its network and use cases are still strong.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Title: Why Is Amylyx Pharmaceuticals (AMLX) Among the Best Biotech Penny Stocks to Invest in Now?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of the 12 Best Biotech Penny Stocks To Invest In Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amylyx Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMLX) stands against the other best biotech penny stocks to invest in now. Goldman Sachs has spotlighted an often-overlooked sector poised to benefit from lower borrowing costs: biotechnology stocks. In a recent note to clients, John Flood, Goldman’s Head of Americas Equities Sales Trading, highlighted biotech as an under-the-radar opportunity for those seeking to capitalize on the Fed’s rate cuts. Flood noted that biotechnology stocks are uniquely sensitive to changes in interest rates as they often rely on projected future profits and are heavily impacted by the cost of capital. With little or no current profitability but significant upside potential, if clinical trials succeed, these stocks have an “option-like structure” that makes them particularly responsive to interest rate movements. The note also emphasized that biotech has recently seen improved fundamentals driven by positive clinical outcomes and a more favorable regulatory environment. Despite these tailwinds, biotech remains under-owned by hedge funds. According to Goldman’s data, the sector ranks in the 13th percentile in hedge fund long/short positioning over the past year and just the 4th percentile over the past five years. Recent performance data supports Goldman’s outlook. The iShares Biotech ETF climbed 7.7% in Q3, outperforming the Nasdaq Biotech Index and more than doubling the S&P 500’s 3.2% gain over the same period. For investors anticipating a continued decline in bond yields, Goldman suggests biotechnology stocks may offer more attractive exposure compared to other rate-sensitive equity sectors, which are more dependent on broader economic growth trends.

In an interview with Yahoo Finance on October 30, Stacey Sears, Portfolio Manager at Emerald Advisers, provided a comprehensive overview of the current landscape and investment opportunities in small and emerging biotechnology companies. Sears acknowledged that there has been a significant innovation in the healthcare industry, especially over the past 20 to 30 years, which was catalyzed after the decoding of the human genome in 2003, as it identified over 8,000 genetic diseases. This breakthrough provided a roadmap for researchers and scientists, leading to accelerated innovation in areas such as DNA and RNA editing and the development of treatments for orphan and rare diseases. Sears noted that small and emerging biotechnology companies have been at the forefront of this innovation. In 2023, approximately two-thirds of all clinical trials were initiated by small and emerging biotechnology firms, and about 56% of new drug substances approved by regulatory bodies originated from these smaller companies. Sears pointed out that the sector has been underperforming over the past couple of years. This underperformance is largely due to the inverse correlation between healthcare stocks and interest rates and yields. However, she noted that the sector is now starting to see a favorable shift. Clinical advancements have continued unabated, and the pipeline of new treatments and drugs remains robust. Large pharmaceutical companies are facing a patent cliff, estimated to be around $30 billion by the end of this decade as their drugs become generic. Small and emerging biotechnology companies are seen as key sources for filling this pipeline. This situation is creating a potential M&A tailwind, as larger companies look to acquire innovative smaller firms to bolster their drug pipelines. The biotechnology sector presents a unique investment opportunity, driven by favorable interest rates, ongoing clinical advancements, and increased M&A activity. Small and emerging biotech firms, in particular, are poised to play a critical role in addressing unmet medical needs and fueling innovation in the healthcare space.

To compile our list of the 12 best biotech penny stocks to invest in now, we used Finviz and Yahoo stock screeners to find the 30 largest biotechnology companies trading below the price of $5 as of December 26. We then used Insider Monkey’s Hedge Fund database to rank 12 stocks according to the largest number of hedge fund holders, as of Q3 2024. The list is sorted in ascending order of hedge fund sentiment. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 26 Stock Price as of December 26: $4.00 Amylyx Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMLX) is a biotechnology company dedicated to developing innovative treatments for patients with neurodegenerative diseases and endocrine conditions characterized by high unmet medical needs. The company has built a robust pipeline of promising therapies, including avexitide, AMX0035, and AMX0114. Amylyx Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMLX) is focusing on the advancement of avexitide, a GLP-1 receptor antagonist with both FDA therapy and orphan drug designations. Avexitide is being developed for the treatment of post-bariatric hypoglycemia (PBH), a debilitating condition that affects a significant portion of bariatric surgery patients. The company is on track to initiate a pivotal Phase III trial in PBH in the first quarter of 2025. This trial is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of avexitide in reducing hypoglycemia events, with topline data expected in 2026. The positive results from earlier clinical trials, including a 66% reduction in Level 3 hypoglycemia events and a 53% reduction in Level 2 hypoglycemia events, provide a strong foundation for the Phase III program. Amylyx Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMLX) is also focusing on the continued development of AMX0035, a novel therapy with potential applications in multiple rare neurodegenerative diseases. The company recently reported positive topline data from the Phase II HELIOS trial of AMX0035 in Wolfram syndrome, a rare genetic disorder characterized by progressive insulin-dependent diabetes, optic atrophy, and deafness. The trial demonstrated significant improvements in pancreatic function and other disease measures, providing a strong rationale for advancing AMX0035 into a Phase III program. Amylyx Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMLX) plans to meet with the FDA and other stakeholders to inform the design of this Phase III trial, with updates expected in 2025. Additionally, the ORION trial of AMX0035 in progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is recruiting well, and the company expects to share interim data in mid-2025. Overall, AMLX ranks 5th on our list of best biotech penny stocks to invest in now. While we acknowledge the potential of AMLX to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMLX but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Mysterious $361.5 Million Bitcoin Transfer Sparks Hot Discussion Within Community

U.Today - The crypto community carefully watches the blockchain space for large transactions, which reflect the current whale activity. According to Whale Alert, a blockchain sleuth that tracks down large cryptocurrency transfers, earlier today, a massive amount of Bitcoin was transferred by cryptocurrency whales. The post said that anonymous wallets had exchanged $361,584,691worth of Bitcoin — 3,856 BTC. In the comments thread, an X user pointed out at the mighty power of blockchain transfers, which cannot be beaten by bank transactions — the transfer fee for moving the $361.5 million in crypto comprised merely 0,00066 BTC, which equates to $61,57: “Thats the power of payment. You can pay this much for 2 usd fees.” Another commentator wrote that this potentially could be an over-the-counter (OTC) purchase/sale or a cryptocurrency exchange/whale restructuring their crypto wallets: “Large BTC transfer indicates potential OTC deal or exchange cold wallet restructuring.” Kiyosaki touched on several topics in it. The first was criticizing the boss of the world’s largest wealth management fund BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), Larry Fink. Kiyosaki tweeted that Fink had begun to dump BTC, most likely referring to massive — close to $200 million — Bitcoin outflows by the company last week in a single day. Then the “Rich Dad Poor Dad” author said that he would continue to buy Bitcoin, contrary to his earlier tweets, in which he claimed that once BTC surpassed $100,000, he would stop doing that. The world’s largest cryptocurrency soared above $108,000 in early December, but currently it is trading at slightly above the $93,000 price level. Kiyosaki believes that Larry Fink is suppressing the price so that whales are able to continue buying it. Financial guru Kiyosaki also doubled down on his ultra-bullish price prediction, made approximately a month ago. According to it, the investment expert sees Bitcoin soaring as high as $350,000 next year, largely thanks to a pro-Bitcoin presidential candidate winning the recent election.

Title: Is UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH) the Best Stock for 10 Years?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Long-Term Stock Portfolio: Best Stocks for 10 Years. In this article, we are going to take a look at where UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH) stands against the other long-term stocks. To select stocks with long-term growth potential, investors should focus on fundamental analysis, evaluating financial health through earnings history, revenue growth, and profit margins. Companies that consistently demonstrate earnings growth and possess a strong competitive advantage are more likely to thrive over time. Investing in dividend-paying stocks is also beneficial, as those that regularly increase dividends indicate financial stability. Identifying stocks in growing industries, such as technology, renewable energy, and healthcare, can further guide investment choices. Diversification across various sectors reduces risk, ensuring that underperformance in one area can be balanced by gains in another. By combining such strategies, investors can improve their chances of finding promising stocks that align with long-term financial goals. On December 26, Drew Pettit, Director at Citi Research, discussed his long-term investment strategy on CNBC as he looks ahead to 2025, emphasizing a "barbell" approach that balances high-growth stocks with lower valuation names. This is relevant for investors considering a long-term stock portfolio over the next decade. Pettit advocates for pairing mega-cap growth stocks with cyclical and defensive sectors, where fundamentals are expected to improve. He believes that adopting this barbell strategy can enhance portfolio resilience and capitalize on diverse market opportunities. In the realm of AI, Pettit noted a growing enthusiasm among investors. He highlighted a shift in perception, moving beyond backend applications to include companies that are more customer-facing within the AI value chain. When it comes to specific investments within AI, Pettit expressed a preference for semiconductors over software at this time. He pointed to Marvell Technology as a standout choice, projecting that its custom AI chip business could experience remarkable growth, projected at 200% next year, followed by an additional 60% growth in the subsequent year. Pettit also discussed his strategy for 2025 and outlined plans to reduce exposure to consumer stocks while focusing on attractive areas within the sector that are less sensitive to interest rates. He highlighted the potential of fintech and payment companies and said that they are well-positioned for long-term growth amid deregulation. Pettit emphasized that his firm's focus is not on cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin but on traditional payment networks. He expressed concerns about consumer data trends and interest rate changes, advocating for a balanced approach by seeking high-quality stocks less affected by rate fluctuations and recommending key positions such Big Tech for long-term investment. Methodology We first sifted through ETFs, online rankings, and internet lists to compile a list of the top blue-chip stocks with a 10-year revenue compound annual growth rate of over 10%. We then selected the 10 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q3 2024. The hedge fund data was sourced from Insider Monkey’s database which tracks the moves of over 900 elite money managers. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A senior healthcare professional giving advice to a patient in a clinic. 10-Year Revenue CAGR: 11.88% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 112 UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH) is a global healthcare company that offers health insurance plans through its UnitedHealthcare segment, and healthcare services through its OptumHealth segment. UnitedHealthcare provides health plans for individuals, employers, and government programs. OptumHealth offers health services like pharmacy care services, health information and technology, care delivery, care management, and population health management. Its key growth driver is its strategic transition to value-based care, a healthcare delivery model that prioritizes improving patient outcomes and reducing costs by incentivizing quality over quantity. This is demonstrated by the company's significant investments in OptumHealth. In 2023, OptumHealth revenues grew by over $2 billion, reaching ~$26 billion, driven by an increase in the number and type of care services offered and the patients served. Patients served by OptumHealth's value-based care models have shown improvements in key health metrics. For example, they are more likely to receive cancer screenings, have better control of chronic conditions like diabetes and hypertension, and are 10% less likely to experience emergency room visits or be readmitted to the hospital compared to patients in traditional fee-for-service models. UnitedHealth Group Inc.'s (NYSE:UNH) is well-positioned to capitalize on the evolving healthcare landscape and continue to deliver strong financial performance. Parnassus Value Equity Fund finds an attractive investment opportunity in UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), a high-quality company with strong long-term growth prospects trading at a discounted valuation. Here's what the firm stated in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “We purchased two new stocks, UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) and Amazon. These are high-quality businesses facing temporary issues, which allowed us to purchase them at discounted valuations. The addition of UnitedHealth increases our small overweight to the Health Care sector. UnitedHealth benefits from secular tailwinds of an aging population, health care cost inflation and increasingly relevant use of heath care data/analytics. It also commands industry leadership when it comes to its extensive assets, vertical integration and deep management bench. Even though the stock has underperformed in the past year, we believe many of those factors have been priced in, positioning it well for growth in the near term.” Overall UNH ranks 6th on our list of the best stocks for 10 years. While we acknowledge the growth potential of UNH as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than UNH but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We then selected the 10 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q3 2024. The hedge fund data was sourced from Insider Monkey’s database which tracks the moves of over 900 elite money managers. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A pharmacist handing out a pharmaceutical drug to a patient in a drug store or chemist. 10-Year Revenue CAGR: 10.97% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 68 AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) is a global biopharmaceutical company that specializes in developing and marketing innovative medicines and therapies for several health conditions. It prioritizes R&D to discover new treatments for complex diseases and maintains a competitive advantage through its diverse product portfolio. Humira, a flagship drug for autoimmune diseases, was a top revenue generator for the company, reaching sales of $21 billion in 2022. However, in Q3 2024, Humira's revenues declined to $2.23 billion, a 37.2% year-over-year decrease, attributed to the loss of patent exclusivity in 2023 and increased competition from biosimilar drugs. Still, the total revenue for AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) rose by 3.8% year-over-year. The immunology segment was a key driver of this growth, generating $7.05 billion in revenue, a ~4% increase year-over-year. The company continues to be a strong investment option for long-term investors. It maintains robust financial performance and consistently rewards shareholders with attractive returns. In its Q3 2024 investor letter, Polaris Global Equity Strategy discussed the strong performance of the US biopharma sector, with AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) demonstrating successful growth despite Humira's exclusivity loss. Here's what the firm had to say: “U.S. biopharma/biotech companies topped the health care sector, with the majority of holdings posting returns in excess of 10%. AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) showed positive top-line growth from its immunosuppressive drugs, Skyrizi and Rinvoq. Abbvie’s management continues to work through the loss of exclusivity from Humira, switching patients to Skyrizi or Rinvoq rather than Humira biosimilars.” Overall ABBV ranks 10th on our list of the best stocks for 10 years. While we acknowledge the growth potential of ABBV as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than ABBV but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Jim Cramer Says Powell Industries, Inc. (POWL)’s Numbers Were Incredible, Stock Now Up 156% YTD

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer's Bold Predictions About These 10 Industrial Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Powell Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ:POWL) stands against the other industrial stocks. As 2024 comes to an end, the flagship S&P index is up by 25.9% year to date, driven primarily by technology stocks and investors rushing to pile into artificial intelligence. Additionally, as opposed to earlier worries of a recession, the US GDP has continued to grow as well. According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), America's economy grew by 3.1% in Q3. According to the IMF, the US GDP is projected to grow by 2.8% in 2024 and stand out from most of the developed world and China. Yet, while technology stocks and the industry are eye-catching, they are not the only components of the economy. In 2024, while the overall economy has grown, some sectors haven't done well. One sector that's often perceived to be the pulse of the economy is the industrial sector. It measures output from large-scale plants, and in today's era of high interest rates, industrial stocks haven't done too well. For instance, while the broader S&P is up 25.9%, its industrial component has managed to post 16.94% in gains this year. The sluggishness in the industrial sector hasn't gone unnoticed by Jim Cramer either. On the day the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 25 basis points but reduced 2025's projected rate cuts to two from an earlier four, Cramer commented on the state of the American economy ahead of the Fed's announcement. He outlined the need to look at other sectors apart from technology. "Look at the material stocks, look at anything related to industrial export. Look at the housing stocks," said Cramer, adding "There are cohorts that are indeed rolling over. It isn’t like everything is just super strong and everything is quantum computing and Rocket Lab!” Cramer wondered why the Fed was cutting rates at all since the economy appeared to be quite robust. He stressed the need to sift through the data to find out the real state of the economy. According to Cramer, "So I think that the talking heads, and boy are there ever a lot of talking heads, have decided that if you look at what we’re seeing in some retailers, things are strong. By the way in retail, it’s not strong either if you count colds.” The CNBC host wasn't convinced by the Atlanta Fed's estimate of the US GDP growing by 3.2% in Q4. He stated that he was "trying to find why. I’m trying to find where that is. You know David that travel’s very strong yeah. Leisure’s very strong. Dining out’s very strong. These are strong and by the way, they’re very obvious, they look obvious to the Atlanta Fed. I don’t know what kind of weighting they have but wow.” Another sector that's representative of the broader economy and ties closely with industrial stocks is the automobile sector. Automotive firms often depend on the outputs of industrial firms, and if the industry is slow then industrial firms also face a demand slowdown. America's two biggest auto manufacturers, the firms behind the F-150 truck and the company developing the Cruise autonomous driving system, have both struggled in the stock market in 2024. The former's stock is down 17.5% year-to-date and the latter was up by a mere 10.5% by early August when investors were more uncertain about the economic outlook. Similarly, Elon Musk's car company had gained just 1.22% ahead of the election as its EV business continued to struggle with competition overseas and slow sales in the US. Cramer also commented on the trouble that the automotive sector is facing during the program. He was perplexed as to why "the problems with autos are not so visible among the cognoscenti." It's important to dig deeper into the automobile industry since it "is a huge industry. Employs a lot of people. And the layoffs and the ramifications of what could happen here and other mergers,” Cramer commented. Our Methodology To compile our list of Jim Cramer's bold predictions about industrial stocks, we scanned the stocks he mentioned in Mad Money and Squawk on the Street as far back as in August. Then, we picked out industrial and materials stocks and ranked them by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q3 2024. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A circuit breaker installed in a control panel illuminated by bright LEDs. Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 26 Date of Cramer’s Comments: 8-19-24 Performance Since Then: 35.10% Powell Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ:POWL) is an industrial equipment provider that primarily makes and sells electrical equipment. Its products are used across a wide range of industries such as utilities, energy exploration, and most important, data centers. Powell Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ:POWL)'s utility and data center businesses have catalyzed the shares this year which are up by 156% year-to-date. The growth has come on the back of the firm's revenue growing by 45% in its fiscal year 2024. The stock soared by 26% after Trump's victory in the November election as investors expected Powell Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ:POWL) to benefit from lower regulation in energy exploration and a broader economic recovery. Here's what Cramer said in August: “Lately, the market has fallen in love with a particular kind of industrial stock. These are still smokestack stocks, but they also have powerful secular growth drivers, meaning they can thrive even if the economy doesn’t accelerate. Tonight, I have a smaller company that falls into the same category: Powell Industries. This company has been around since 1947 and went public decades ago. However, the stock has caught my attention over the past couple of years, skyrocketing from $20 in late September 2022 to $171 today—a gain of more than 700%. So, what does this company do, and how did the stock manage to catch fire like this? More importantly, can it keep running once the Fed starts blessing us with rate hikes? Overall POWL ranks 9th on our list of the industrial stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about. While we acknowledge the potential of POWL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than POWL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Why The 60/40 Portfolio Needs Bitcoin In Today’s Market
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/12/30/why-the-6040-portfolio-needs-bitcoin-in-todays-market/
Time Published: 2024-12-30T14:38:32Z

Metallic Bitcoin symbol with financial chart over dark background. Horizontal composition with ... [+] selective focus and copy space. If you happen to be a Bitcoin skeptic, you’re not alone. A recent Pew Research survey found that 63% of Americans are not confident in the reliability or safety of cryptocurrencies in general. But when BlackRock speaks, it often pays to listen. In its just-released 2025 Global Outlook report, the world’s largest asset management firm lays out a case for Bitcoin not only as a diversifier alongside gold but also a strategic hedge against an environment where the historical stock-bond correlation is breaking down. For decades, the classic 60/40 portfolio—60% stocks, 40% bonds—was the gold standard of diversification. When stocks crashed, as they did during the dotcom bubble and global financial crisis, bonds usually rose in value, providing a cushion against market volatility. But we’re in a new regime now where this correlation has become increasingly unreliable. If you recall, 2022 was the worst year on record for U.S. stocks and bonds. BlackRock identifies this trend and suggests that investors need to look beyond government bonds for diversification. This is where gold and Bitcoin come into play. Both assets offer unique advantages as hedges and diversifiers, but they do so in different ways. Bitcoin’s potential as a portfolio diversifier stems from its unique value proposition. It has a fixed supply of 21 million coins, and its demand is influenced by adoption trends, investor sentiment and macroeconomic factors. In the days following the November election, Bitcoin surged above $100,000, with its market cap topping $2 trillion—just under 2% of the total value of global equities. Bitcoin's market cap approaches 2% of global equities Last Thursday, Bitcoin tumbled 3.6%, falling back below $100,000, on the news that the Federal Reserve will approve fewer interest rate cuts than the market expected next year. BlackRock isn’t suggesting that Bitcoin should replace bonds in your portfolio. Instead, they’re recommending a modest allocation—1% to 2%—to capture its diversification benefits without significantly increasing risk. In fact, a 2% Bitcoin allocation provides a similar risk profile to holding the “Magnificent Seven” tech stocks (Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta and Tesla) in a balanced portfolio. Even though Bitcoin’s market cap has fallen below $2 trillion, it remains the seventh-largest asset in the world, ahead of Saudi Aramco and even silver. The global gold market, by comparison, is valued at $17.8 trillion—nine times larger than Bitcoin. But Bitcoin’s growth trajectory is undeniable. Before its price declined, it took 40 ounces of gold to buy one Bitcoin. That’s roughly double what it was at the beginning of the year. Bitcoin doubled its value relative to gold in 2024 Galaxy Digital’s Mike Novogratz believes Bitcoin could match and even surpass gold’s $17 trillion market cap within the next five to eight years. That’s a bold prediction, but it’s not without merit. As more investors, institutions and nations adopt Bitcoin, its scarcity becomes more pronounced, potentially driving prices higher. While Bitcoin has established itself as digital gold, Dogecoin has carved out a niche as a lighthearted, community-driven cryptocurrency with surprising staying power. Originally launched as a joke in 2013, Dogecoin has since grown into a legitimate digital asset with a market cap in the tens of billions. Dogecoin’s appeal lies in its utility for microtransactions. It’s used mostly to tip content creators and foster online engagement. Its low transaction fees and fast processing times make it an ideal currency for small, everyday payments. Unlike Bitcoin’s fixed supply, Dogecoin has no hard cap, which helps keep its price stable for transactional use. Elon Musk’s longtime support of Dogecoin has contributed to its growing popularity. News that President-elect Trump plans to appoint Musk to co-lead the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, has added to the speculation and excitement. Since the election, Dogecoin has significantly outperformed Bitcoin. Dogecoin has outperformed Bitcoin since the U.S. election While it’s still seen as a “meme coin,” Dogecoin’s growing user base and real-world utility suggest that it might deserve a closer look from investors. There’s even talk of a Dogecoin ETF next year. BlackRock’s research makes a compelling case for a 1% to 2% allocation to Bitcoin. I believe this relatively small position can provide meaningful diversification benefits without exposing your portfolio to excessive risk. And as Bitcoin’s market cap continues to grow, that modest allocation could deliver outsized returns. Remember, Bitcoin is still a volatile asset. But so was gold during the 1970s when it was reintroduced to the free market after the collapse of the Bretton Woods system. I’ve been in this game for decades, and what I know is that over time, volatility tends to decline as an asset becomes more widely adopted. Gold will always have a place in my portfolio as the ultimate store of value. But it’s also important to stay open to new opportunities. Bitcoin represents a new frontier in wealth preservation and growth, and even the most conservative investors can no longer afford to ignore it. One Community. Many Voices.

We recently compiled a list of the 9 Important AI News and Ratings on Investors' Radar. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) stands against the other AI stocks. Artificial intelligence has become a dominant force in the stock market, driving the performance of top companies and capturing the attention of major investors. Insider Monkey's Q3 data reveals that 15 of the 20 companies most favored by hedge funds are deeply involved in AI, reflecting its growing influence across industries. The Magnificent 7 stocks, which include tech giants leading the AI revolution, remain the most widely held by hedge funds, highlighting their central role in shaping market trends. The AI boom continues to surge, fueled by companies not just adopting but spearheading advancements in this transformative technology. As valuations for AI-driven stocks climb to unprecedented levels, the sustainability of this rally comes into question. Can the sector’s rapid growth justify its soaring price tags, or is a market correction inevitable? Investors remain on edge, closely monitoring the balance between innovation and valuation. According to a CNBC report, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang described the “AI computing ramp” as being in its early stages, with years of growth ahead, predicting AI-driven advancements in fields like science and healthcare. CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz highlighted how AI is enabling both cybercriminals and cybersecurity efforts, calling it the future “battle of AI.” Snowflake CEO Sridhar Ramaswamy emphasized generative AI’s role in democratizing enterprise data, noting ongoing collaborations and a robust AI product pipeline. AMD CEO Lisa Su discussed the competitive semiconductor market, stating that different computing architectures are needed for AI’s diverse applications and stressing that AI’s full impact will unfold over the years. Lastly, Generac CEO Aaron Jagdfeld pointed to increasing power grid pressures due to AI-related technology demands, emphasizing the growing need for backup solutions for critical facilities. READ ALSO: 11 Trending AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings and Jim Cramer Talked About These 8 Stocks. While AI is so far looking like a force for good, it is coming with its own challenges. According to the Bloomberg report, AI Needs So Much Power, It’s Making Yours Worse, the U.S. power grid is facing growing challenges from "bad harmonics," which occur when electrical wave patterns deviate from the ideal. These distortions can damage home appliances, increase fire risks, and signal deeper grid issues. Data shows that households near data centers experience more severe harmonics, with over half of homes with the worst distortions located within 20 miles of major data center activity. In areas like Northern Virginia, where data centers dominate, the proportion of homes experiencing high harmonic distortions exceeds the national average fourfold. Whisker Labs, using a million residential sensors, reports that 1.7% of sensors nationwide exceeded the 8% distortion threshold, a figure that jumps to 6% in areas like Prince William County, Virginia, the report states. While some utilities dispute these findings, the data highlights how data centers, combined with aging infrastructure, electrification trends, and extreme weather, are straining the grid. As the electricity demand for data centers increases, Big Tech is looking toward nuclear fuels to meet the demand. For example, Reuters reported that Amazon has signed three agreements to develop small modular reactors (SMRs) to address the growing power demand from data centers. One project, in collaboration with X-Energy, will be based near a Northwest Energy site in Washington state and aims to generate up to 960 MW, enough to power over 770,000 homes. The company is also funding a $500 million round for X-Energy’s SMR development, targeting over 5 gigawatts of capacity by 2039. These moves come as U.S. data center power usage is set to triple by 2030. It has also partnered with Dominion Energy for an SMR project in Virginia.

Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff promoted the company's AI agents in a Yahoo Finance interview. In another Yahoo Finance interview, D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria tempered expectations about their revenue impact. He noted that Salesforce’s proposed per-transaction pricing model could worry customers, as high usage might lead to unpredictable costs. While the approach may take time for customers to adapt, Luria believes it will likely contribute only modestly to revenue next year. This comes as Salesforce is projected to approach $40 billion in revenue, making the AI agents less impactful on its overall financial performance.

In recent years, investors have shown a preference for global stocks, particularly high-growth options like US technology companies, over UK equities. Over the past decade, the British index has achieved a 6% annual total return compared to 13% for the US broader market. Analysts suggest that this underperformance is partly due to weak earnings, domestic political instability, and the absence of a significant technology sector in the UK market. However, a notable factor is the sharp decline in valuations as investors have steered away from UK stocks. Goldman Sachs remarked that the challenge is not a lack of interest from foreign investors, who currently hold about two-thirds of the UK market capitalization, but rather the limited participation of domestic investors in UK equities. That said, investing in UK stocks can still be a worthwhile choice. While the UK market lacks significant technology companies, its equities in sectors like finance, energy, and mining provide diversification opportunities that complement the tech-heavy and highly valued US markets. In addition, the UK’s index faces less risk from tariffs and trade restrictions. Goldman Sachs Research highlighted that UK equities could gain from various government measures, such as pension reforms aimed at boosting domestic investment in UK stocks and policies supporting homebuilding initiatives. Lindsay Matcham, involved in futures sales trading at Goldman Sachs Global Banking & Markets, suggested that UK equities could appeal to investors seeking diversification. She noted that these stocks offer attractive valuations, strong dividend yields, and reduced concentration risk. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, presented a rather interesting take on the UK market's limited exposure to technology stocks. He pointed out that this reduced exposure has made the UK stock market less volatile compared to the US, where technology stocks are a key driver of market fluctuations. Mould observed that, despite its criticisms, the UK market experienced a relatively stable summer compared to the US, attributing this to differences in valuation and the relative expectations of the two markets. The lower volatility in the UK market presents compelling investment opportunities, particularly given its attractive dividend yields. The FTSE 100 offers a yield of 3.68%, while the FTSE 250, representing medium-sized UK firms, provides slightly lower but still appealing income prospects. This setup allows investors to explore higher-growth sectors, such as smaller companies while benefiting from rising dividends. According to BlackRock, UK dividends are currently growing at a rate of 2-3%, aligning with long-term inflation. Stocks that consistently grow their dividends often have stable cash flows, enabling them to increase payouts over time. Janus Henderson’s 2023 annual dividend report highlighted this upward trend, revealing that UK dividends reached approximately $86 billion in 2023, a significant rise from the $63.1 billion distributed in 2020. Given this, we will take a look at some of the best FTSE dividend stocks. Our Methodology: For this list, we reviewed the UK CCC Dividend list, which highlights UK companies with the longest histories of dividend growth. This list is based on the structure of David Fish’s US Dividend Champions spreadsheet and serves as a useful tool to help identify and screen dividend growth stocks in the UK. From this list, we chose 10 stocks with the highest dividend yields as of December 29 and arranged them in order from lowest to highest yield. We also measured hedge fund sentiment around each stock according to Insider Monkey’s database of 900 as of Q3 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

Dividend Yield as of December 29: 4.37% NatWest Group plc (NYSE:NWG) is a London-based retail and commercial bank that offers mortgages, loans, credit cards, and related services. In the third quarter of 2024, the company reported an attributable profit of £1.17 billion and a return on tangible equity (RoTE) of 18.3%. Customer deposits, excluding central items, grew by £2.2 billion, driven by increased savings across all three business sectors. The company expects to maintain a RoTE above 15% for 2024 and projects income, excluding notable items, to reach around £14.4 billion. In addition, total income, excluding notable items, increased by £182 million (5.1%) compared to Q2 2024, primarily due to growth in lending, deposits, and margin improvement. L1 Capital also highlighted this in its Q3 2024 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say: “NatWest Group plc (NYSE:NWG): NatWest is the largest commercial lender in the U.K. (20% share) and the second largest U.K. retail bank with ~13% of all mortgages. We see NatWest as best positioned in the U.K. Banking sector to benefit from improving margin trends, with topline growth supported by a rebound in U.K. housing and economic activity. Moreover, with significant buybacks owing to a strong capital position, NatWest should see ~8% EPS growth p.a. over the next three years vs. ~2% expected growth for CBA. Although CBA enjoys a more dominant market position in Australia vs. NatWest in the U.K., it appears overvalued in our view as it trades on ~24x FY25 P/E (historical highs) compared to only ~7x for NatWest. NatWest Group plc (NYSE:NWG) is delivering solid returns in 2024, surging by nearly 83% in the past 12 months. A significant portion of the company's success in the past year is due to the unusually high interest rates, which allowed the bank to achieve exceptionally strong returns on its loans. In 2024, the bank consistently kept its net interest margin—the difference between the interest it paid and earned—above 2%. NatWest Group plc (NYSE:NWG) is a solid dividend payer as the company expects to pay ordinary dividends amounting to approximately 40% of its attributable profit in FY24. Currently, it pays a semi-annual dividend of $0.1543 per share for a dividend yield of 4.37%, as of December 29. As of the close of Q3 2024, 15 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported having stakes in NatWest Group plc (NYSE:NWG), up from 11 in the previous quarter. These stakes are collectively valued at over $33.8 million. Overall NWG ranks 3rd on our list of the U.K. dividend champions for 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of NWG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NWG but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Dividend Yield as of December 29: 3.26% A British multinational alcoholic beverage company, Diageo plc (NYSE:DEO) ranks fourth on our list of the best FTSE dividend stocks. The stock has dropped by nearly 13% over the past year, largely due to a challenging macroeconomic environment. Despite this, analysts remain optimistic about the company's growth prospects. Diageo holds leading products in categories like scotch, gin, and vodka. Its large scale allows for substantial marketing investments, ensuring its brands remain prominent and difficult for competitors to displace. In addition, the company's size provides a strategic advantage, enabling it to acquire smaller competitors and increase their value before they become significant threats. Diageo plc (NYSE:DEO) reported positive FY24 earnings that were reassuring for investors. The company generated $20.3 billion in revenue, which represented a slight decrease of 1.4% compared to the previous year. The report also highlighted that Diageo either grew or maintained its market share in over 75% of its net sales across measured markets, including the US. Aristotle Capital Management, LLC made the following comment about DEO in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “Headquartered in London, England, Diageo plc (NYSE:DEO) is a global leader in the alcoholic beverages industry. The company has a vast portfolio of over 200 well-recognized premium spirits (~80% of FY 2024 sales), beers (~15% and mostly Guinness) and other beverages (~5%) that are sold in nearly 180 countries. Led by its Johnnie Walker brand, Diageo is the world’s largest exporter of Scotch whiskey—its largest category at ~25% of sales—followed by other spirits such as tequila and vodka (~10% each). Diageo also owns a ~34% stake in the premium champagne and cognac maker Moët Hennessy (a subsidiary of LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton). Diageo plc (NYSE:DEO) has been gaining momentum due to its robust cash flow. In FY24, the company generated $4.1 billion in operating cash flow and $2.6 billion in free cash flow, reflecting year-over-year increases of $0.5 billion and $0.4 billion, respectively. With this strong cash position, Diageo returned $1 billion to shareholders during the fiscal year and raised its annual dividend by 5%, bringing it to $1.0348 per share. The stock's dividend yield comes in at 3.26%, as of December 29. Of the 900 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey at the end of Q3 2024, 26 funds held stakes in Diageo plc (NYSE:DEO), compared with 31 in the previous quarter. These stakes are worth nearly $703 million in total. Overall DEO ranks 4th on our list of the U.K. dividend champions for 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of DEO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Title: Is NextEra Energy, Inc. (NEE) the Best Dividend Growth Stock to Buy and Hold in 2025?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Dividend Growth Stocks to Buy and Hold in 2025. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) stands against the other dividend growth stocks. Dividend stocks had a challenging year in 2024 as investor interest largely shifted toward technology stocks. The Dividend Aristocrat Index, which monitors companies with at least 25 years of consecutive dividend growth, rose by just over 5% year-to-date, significantly trailing the nearly 26% return of the broader market. This underperformance isn't unusual for dividend stocks, which often struggle to compete for attention against more dynamic market options. However, seasoned investors may recognize the enduring value and potential of dividend stocks over the long term. Also read: 8 Best German Dividend Stocks To Invest In Historically, dividends have played a significant role in the total returns of US stocks, accounting for nearly one-third of overall equity returns since 1926. Between 1980 and 2019, a period marked by declining interest rates, dividends contributed 75% to the broader market’s return. In an environment of falling interest rates, dividends become even more valuable by providing a steady cash flow when fixed-income investments may offer lower yields. Companies that initiate dividends rarely stop paying them and often increase payouts over time. In addition, offering a dividend can enhance a stock's appeal to investors, potentially boosting its market value. According to a report by Franklin Templeton, over the last decade, dividends for the broader market index have consistently increased, with an average annual growth rate of just over 7%. In favorable market conditions, dividends have boosted total returns. During challenging years, such as 2020 and 2022, when returns were low or negative, dividends played a more significant role in total returns, offering stability and strengthening portfolio resilience. This resilience of dividend stocks is rooted in the robust financial health and strong balance sheets of the companies behind them. Analysts emphasize the importance of targeting high-quality dividend-paying firms when investing in this category. Ramona Persaud, who manages the Fidelity Equity-Income Fund and Fidelity Global Equity Income Fund, shares this perspective. She prioritizes investments in well-established companies with solid dividends and attractive valuations. Persaud noted that falling interest rates often create favorable conditions for dividend stocks, as their yields become more appealing compared to declining bond yields. She also highlighted that lower rates could broaden market gains, unlike the past two years, where growth was dominated by a small number of large-cap stocks. Here are some other comments from the analyst: "Ideally, I look for a stock that has a combination of these factors. I can't always get all 3, so I look for a good balance of them. If I can get higher quality at a cheaper price, and the company pays a compelling dividend, that's when a stock is really interesting to me." High-quality companies also provide the benefit of consistent dividend growth. Investors view dividends as a long-term commitment, so companies that pay them must maintain profitability, generate returns, and ensure steady cash flow. This makes dividends an important measure of a company’s overall quality. Firms that regularly raise their dividend payments show that they are consistently generating profits, which may indicate greater resilience during economic or market downturns. Our Methodology: For this article, we scanned the list of dividend aristocrats, which are the companies that have raised their payouts for 25 consecutive years or more. From that list, we picked 10 companies with the highest 5-year annual average dividend growth rates. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of their annual average dividend growth in the past five years. We also considered hedge fund sentiment around each stock in Insider Monkey’s database, as of the third quarter of 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A wind turbine, its blades spinning to generate clean renewable energy. 5-Year Annual Dividend Growth Rate: 10.51% NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) ranks fifth on our list of the best dividend aristocrat stocks. The Florida-based renewable energy company posted strong earnings recently. In the third quarter of 2024, the company reported revenue of $7.57 billion, a 5.6% increase from the previous year. The company had another strong quarter in renewable energy and storage development, adding about 3 gigawatts (GW) to its project backlog for the second consecutive quarter. Over the past four quarters, it has secured roughly 11 GW in new projects. Madison Investments made the following comment about NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “The top contributors in the quarter were NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE), Oracle Corporation, Progressive Corporation, Equifax Inc., and United Healthcare. NextEra has continued to perform well given its strong position in the renewable energy space, increasing demand for power, its transmission capabilities, as well as a tailwind from lower interest rates.” In addition to its strong foundation, NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) has developed one of the largest portfolios of solar and wind power assets worldwide. This segment has gained from the shift away from polluting carbon fuels towards cleaner, renewable energy sources. Given the long-term nature of the power transition, the company is poised for continued growth over the coming decades. In the past 12 months, the stock has delivered a nearly 19% return to shareholders. NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) announced a quarterly dividend of $0.515 per share on October 18, which fell in line with its previous dividend. In 2024, the company stretched its dividend growth streak to 28 years. Moreover, the company has raised its payouts at an annual average rate of over 10.5% in the past five years. The stock supports a dividend yield of 2.86%, as of December 29. Of the 900 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey at the end of Q3 2024, 69 funds held stakes in NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE), compared with 73 in the previous quarter. The consolidated value of these stakes is more than $2.47 billion. Rajiv Jain's GQG Partners was the company's leading stakeholder in Q3. Overall NEE ranks 5th on our list of the best dividend growth stocks to buy and hold in 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of NEE as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NEE but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: While institutions own 40% of Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft (ETR:DBK), individual investors are its largest shareholders with 58% ownership
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/while-institutions-own-40-deutsche-062344957.html

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Deutsche Bank's significant individual investors ownership suggests that the key decisions are influenced by shareholders from the larger public A total of 25 investors have a majority stake in the company with 35% ownership Institutional ownership in Deutsche Bank is 40% If you want to know who really controls Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft (ETR:DBK), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. We can see that individual investors own the lion's share in the company with 58% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn). And institutions on the other hand have a 40% ownership in the company. Insiders often own a large chunk of younger, smaller, companies while huge companies tend to have institutions as shareholders. Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Deutsche Bank, beginning with the chart below. View our latest analysis for Deutsche Bank Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index. We can see that Deutsche Bank does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Deutsche Bank, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Deutsche Bank. BlackRock, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 6.2% of shares outstanding. Capital Research and Management Company is the second largest shareholder owning 4.7% of common stock, and The Vanguard Group, Inc. holds about 4.1% of the company stock. Our studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder. Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future. While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves. Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances. Shareholders would probably be interested to learn that insiders own shares in Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft. It is a very large company, and board members collectively own €336m worth of shares (at current prices). we sometimes take an interest in whether they have been buying or selling. The general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, collectively holds 58% of Deutsche Bank shares. With this amount of ownership, retail investors can collectively play a role in decisions that affect shareholder returns, such as dividend policies and the appointment of directors. They can also exercise the power to vote on acquisitions or mergers that may not improve profitability. It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Deutsche Bank better, we need to consider many other factors. Case in point: We've spotted 1 warning sign for Deutsche Bank you should be aware of.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published an article titled Jim Cramer's Bold Predictions About These 15 AI Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other AI stocks Jim Cramer talked about. As trading in 2024 heads towards a close, major stock market indexes have had a good run despite mixed performance across sectors. The flagship S&P index is up 26% year-to-date while the broader NASDAQ index has gained 33.56%. On top of this, the index of the NASDAQ's top 100 stocks is up 29.8%, which solidifies the conclusion that technology stocks have driven the stock market's 2024 returns. For further evidence, consider the Dow's performance. The stock index which tracks industries across the US economy is up 14% YTD, making it the weakest-performing index among all mentioned. However, even within technology, not all stocks have performed equally well. As an example, consider the performance of two stocks. Both of these are semiconductor companies. The first, which ranked 3rd on our list of Jim Cramer's bearish tech calls is the largest American manufacturer of memory chips. The second, which ranked 1st on the same list is Wall Street's AI darling. The two stocks have gained 7.64% and 184.60% year-to-date, so even though both of them are technology companies, their share price returns have differed primarily because of the firms' varying exposures to artificial intelligence. Yet even though AI has held up the stock market in 2024, other factors continue to influence stock performance as well. Continuing with our example of the GPU designer's shares, the stock dropped by 1.1% on the day the Federal Reserve cut interest rates but guided two cuts for 2024 instead of the earlier four. The shares fell despite the fact that the firm enjoys the widest moat possible in the AI industry. On the same day, the flagship S&P and the broader NASDAQ indexes shed 2.9% and 3.6%, respectively. Following the year-end sell-off on Friday, neither index has fully recovered to levels before the Fed's announcement. Cramer, for his part, had predicted that the markets might not find it easy to reverse all losses following the Fed's announcement. Talking on CNBC's Squawk on the Street on the day after the Fed's decision, the host shared that "rampant Bitcoin speculation, after speculation in nuclear power, after speculation in quantum computing" was baked into markets ahead of the announcement. Commenting on quantum computing in particular, Cramer mentioned one quantum computing stock and wondered whether the industry was all hype and no substance. "How is that [the firm] going to quantum? When we don’t even know what quantum is?" wondered Cramer. "It’s a nonfungible tokens, right? Cause you know what a fungible token was?” he added. As AI continues to shape the winners and losers in the stock market, Cramer also shared tips for trading in 2025 in a recent Mad Money episode. He believes that one key fact that everyone needs to keep in mind when trading is to not get disillusioned by strong gains. According to Cramer, while bulls and bears both "make money" on the stock market, it's the pigs that "get slaughtered." He elaborated further and shared that in his experience he's "seen moments where stocks went up and up and up so much that people were intoxicated with their gains." Yet, it's "precisely at that point of intoxication that you need to remind yourself that you don’t want to act like a pig," believes the television show host. Cramer's second tip for successful investing is to have the fortitude to hold stocks even when the market is tough. He believes that not only is holding through the thick and thin 'the hardest part of investing," but adds that "taking short-term pains so you can have long-term gains" lies at the heart of the market's performance "for a century.” Finally, one key factor that several people ignore while trading stocks is to hunt for the right entry price. Cramer cautions against buying in bulk. "Do not, under any circumstances, buy your whole position at once," he stresses and adds that "you should never sell all at once," either. Instead, Cramer recommends staging "your buys, work your orders, try to get the best price over time.” Our Methodology To compile our list of Jim Cramer's bold predictions about AI stocks, we scanned the stocks he mentioned in Mad Money and Squawk on the Street as far back as in August. Then, we picked out stocks with AI computing, hardware, and energy generation exposure, and ranked them by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q3 2024. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping. Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 286 Date of Cramer’s Comments: 08-14-24 Performance Since Then: 31.56% Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is the biggest eCommerce firm in the US and also a key player in the lucrative cloud computing industry. Its partnership with AI firm Anthropic has also allowed the company to establish a foothold for itself in the AI industry and access technologies for enterprise AI products provided through AWS. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is also among the handful of firms that operate across all layers of the AI stack - from designing custom chips to providing end-use applications. The tail-end of November and the start of December have been great for Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s shares as its Project Rainier supercomputer built using in-house Trainium chips will be used by Anthropic to train AI. Cramer was very optimistic about the firm in August: "We recently bought more Amazon shares because I believe the market was too harsh on their last quarter. Amazon is a buy, and I think it will continue to perform well." Overall AMZN ranks 1st on our list of the AI stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Why investing for the long run, especially if you buy certain popular stocks, could reap huge rewards. The technology provides blowing-filling-capping solutions for water, milk, and juice bottles in beverage applications. The S&P 500 index is set to cap off a banner year. Investing in the S&P 500 through an exchange-traded fund (ETF) is generally a smart move as the index has historically returned an annual average of 9% per year with dividends reinvested, but other funds may beat the S&P 500. One of the best-performing ETFs of the last 10 years has been the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SMH), up roughly 800% over that time span. Investors of all types can benefit from the power of dividend stocks. Although dividends are usually sought by those in or nearing retirement, those regular payouts can contribute mightily to your long-term returns wherever you are in your investing journey. In those times, recurring dividend payments can cushion a portfolio's returns and give an investor cash to reinvest while stocks are trading at lower levels. With the broader stock market indexes hovering around all-time highs, some investors may fear that a sell-off is creeping on the horizon in 2025. After all, equity prices have outpaced earnings growth, leading to a relatively expensive market. Investment management firm Vanguard offers several low-cost ETFs that target various themes and stock market sectors. Futures fall: The S&P 500 is set to undercut a key level after Friday's sell-off. Nvidia has a new buy point. Tesla deliveries loom. Apple is close to becoming the first company ever to reach $4 trillion in market value. Monitor these key chart levels. AMD shares are one of the few big-tech names riding a big decline into the final trading days of the year. Investors remain concerned that the Federal Reserve won’t cut interest rates as aggressively as hoped in 2025. Lower rates help boost economic growth—and make buying new cars more affordable. Aside from the market move, there haven’t been any new analyst reports or price target changes to pin Tesla’s move on. Sign in to access your portfolio

Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 235 Date of Cramer’s Comments: 08-12-24 Performance Since Then: 16.25% Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is one of the biggest social media companies in the world. The firm has managed to position itself as one of the most important AI stocks in the industry after suffering devastating market performance in 2022 because of Mark Zuckerberg's focus on the metaverse. Now, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) has shaped up as an important AI player because of its 3 billion+ user base which investors believe can be used to monetize AI and push services to consumers. The firm is already allowing advertisers to use AI tools to run campaigns, and its narrative depends on sustained AI monetization. Another major catalyst for Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)'s stock in H2 2024 has been a potential TikTok ban that could further grow its user base. Cramer was full of praise for the firm's AI division in August: "We're constantly being told that none of the big companies spending fortune in video chips for AI has seen any meaningful return on that investment. They're only doing it to prevent their competitors from getting an edge. That's what we keep on hearing. That's absurd! Memo to the clueless naysaying individuals: Have you seen what Meta Platforms has been doing with their computing power? They have, out of nowhere, become one of the most popular generative AI platforms with Meta AI. You have to try. I have switched to it. It is that good. Meta has been using their Nvidia purchases to make instagram reels much more relevant to you, much faster, cleaner. Meta has the best numbers of any of the tech titans. You think that's some sort of coincidence?" Overall META ranks 2nd on our list of the AI stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

The firm commands the lion's share of the AI GPU market as it enjoys a large competitive advantage through the performance of its chips. Yet, since AI is a relatively nascent industry and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) doesn't enjoy a similar presence in other markets, its shares are dependent on AI's fate. The stock has struggled since July as investors wait to see NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s Blackwell products, supply chain strengths, and cost control. Here's what Cramer said in August: "Nvidia's Jensen Huang has been telling you can get 4x your money if you buy his chips. That's 4x return. I think Meta could end up getting that. The others, they actually have to spend to play catchup. It's not mythical, it's reality. How much money have you made over the years betting against Jensen Huang?"

Its presence in the CPU industry has helped Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) eke out market share following chip giant Intel's historic struggles with manufacturing the latest chips. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)'s acquisitions over the past couple of years have provided it with a footing in tertiary industries such as FPGAs and AI products. While its AI accelerators are also somewhat popular, sentiment has soured in the year's second half. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)'s shares are down by 9.6% year-to-date; but, Cramer was optimistic in August: "AMD isn't nipping at their heels. AMD is dominating. It's actually taking gobs of market share, and galy 3 is not a factor when it comes to Nvidia's high-end chips." Overall AMD ranks 8th on our list of the AI stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about. While we acknowledge the potential of AMD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Jim Cramer on Tesla, Inc (TSLA): ‘Shares Of Tesla Are Down About 13% Year To Date’

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published an article titled Jim Cramer's Bold Predictions About These 15 AI Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Tesla, Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) stands against the other AI stocks Jim Cramer talked about. As trading in 2024 heads towards a close, major stock market indexes have had a good run despite mixed performance across sectors. The flagship S&P index is up 26% year-to-date while the broader NASDAQ index has gained 33.56%. On top of this, the index of the NASDAQ's top 100 stocks is up 29.8%, which solidifies the conclusion that technology stocks have driven the stock market's 2024 returns. For further evidence, consider the Dow's performance. The stock index which tracks industries across the US economy is up 14% YTD, making it the weakest-performing index among all mentioned. However, even within technology, not all stocks have performed equally well. As an example, consider the performance of two stocks. Both of these are semiconductor companies. The first, which ranked 3rd on our list of Jim Cramer's bearish tech calls is the largest American manufacturer of memory chips. The second, which ranked 1st on the same list is Wall Street's AI darling. The two stocks have gained 7.64% and 184.60% year-to-date, so even though both of them are technology companies, their share price returns have differed primarily because of the firms' varying exposures to artificial intelligence. Yet even though AI has held up the stock market in 2024, other factors continue to influence stock performance as well. Continuing with our example of the GPU designer's shares, the stock dropped by 1.1% on the day the Federal Reserve cut interest rates but guided two cuts for 2024 instead of the earlier four. The shares fell despite the fact that the firm enjoys the widest moat possible in the AI industry. On the same day, the flagship S&P and the broader NASDAQ indexes shed 2.9% and 3.6%, respectively. Following the year-end sell-off on Friday, neither index has fully recovered to levels before the Fed's announcement. Cramer, for his part, had predicted that the markets might not find it easy to reverse all losses following the Fed's announcement. Talking on CNBC's Squawk on the Street on the day after the Fed's decision, the host shared that "rampant Bitcoin speculation, after speculation in nuclear power, after speculation in quantum computing" was baked into markets ahead of the announcement. Commenting on quantum computing in particular, Cramer mentioned one quantum computing stock and wondered whether the industry was all hype and no substance. "How is that [the firm] going to quantum? When we don’t even know what quantum is?" wondered Cramer. "It’s a nonfungible tokens, right? Cause you know what a fungible token was?” he added. As AI continues to shape the winners and losers in the stock market, Cramer also shared tips for trading in 2025 in a recent Mad Money episode. He believes that one key fact that everyone needs to keep in mind when trading is to not get disillusioned by strong gains. According to Cramer, while bulls and bears both "make money" on the stock market, it's the pigs that "get slaughtered." He elaborated further and shared that in his experience he's "seen moments where stocks went up and up and up so much that people were intoxicated with their gains." Yet, it's "precisely at that point of intoxication that you need to remind yourself that you don’t want to act like a pig," believes the television show host. Cramer's second tip for successful investing is to have the fortitude to hold stocks even when the market is tough. He believes that not only is holding through the thick and thin 'the hardest part of investing," but adds that "taking short-term pains so you can have long-term gains" lies at the heart of the market's performance "for a century.” Finally, one key factor that several people ignore while trading stocks is to hunt for the right entry price. Cramer cautions against buying in bulk. "Do not, under any circumstances, buy your whole position at once," he stresses and adds that "you should never sell all at once," either. Instead, Cramer recommends staging "your buys, work your orders, try to get the best price over time.” Our Methodology To compile our list of Jim Cramer's bold predictions about AI stocks, we scanned the stocks he mentioned in Mad Money and Squawk on the Street as far back as in August. Then, we picked out stocks with AI computing, hardware, and energy generation exposure, and ranked them by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q3 2024. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). 25 Most In Demand Cars Heading into 2024 Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 99 Date of Cramer’s Comments: 8-19-24 Performance Since Then: 93.81% Tesla, Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) is the world's biggest pure-play electric vehicle company which is also a key player in the AI industry due to the tech-focused nature of its CEO Elon Musk. The firm's assisted driving platform FSD is among the market leaders in its niche, and it uses AI and copious computing resources to derive real-time driving insights. Musk's proximity with President-elect Donald Trump has also injected fresh life into Tesla, Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s shares since the November election. Ahead of the election, the shares were up by a meager 1.22% year-to-date due to broader weakness in the EV industry and a lack of clear guidance on autonomous ridesharing and other initiatives. Since then, Tesla, Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s stock has gained 71.7%. Here's what Cramer said in August: "Investors should own shares of Tesla [heading] into the electric vehicle maker’s robotaxi event set for Oct. 10, according to analysts at Piper Sandler. The unveiling event was originally slated for Aug. 8, but CEO Elon Musk has said he requested design changes that resulted in the delay. Piper Sandler maintained its buy-equivalent rating and $300 price target on the stock. Shares of Tesla are down about 13% year to date." Overall TSLA ranks 9th on our list of the AI stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about. While we acknowledge the potential of TSLA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than TSLA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Bitcoin As A Strategic Asset? CryptoQuant CEO Questions US’s Next Move
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-as-a-strategic-asset-cryptoquant-ceo-questions-uss-next-move/
Time Published: 2024-12-30T00:30:53Z

Since President-elect Donald Trump raised the possibility of establishing a US Bitcoin Strategic Reserve, many advocates have pushed for the creation of the crypto stockpile, saying that it would make the country as the leader in the global cryptocurrency landscape. However, not everyone in the crypto community is convinced of the feasibility of the crypto reserve. CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju is pessimistic that the prospect of the Bitcoin Strategic Reserve would get an approval from the incoming administration. Young Ju is not convinced that the proposed Bitcoin reserve would push through, saying it is unlikely that Trump would embrace the crypto strategy to protect US dollar dominance because the greenback remains a safe haven currency. Throughout history, whenever the United States perceived a threat to its dominance in the global economy, gold prices surged, and debates around the gold standard gained traction. In the late 1990s, Peter Schiff championed gold as the true form of money, much like today’s… — Ki Young Ju (@ki_young_ju) December 28, 2024 The executive of CryptoQuant thinks that the policies of the new government would be much influenced by the apparent strength of the US economy and the predominance of the American currency in international trade. Young Ju said that if there is a perceived threat to the US economic hegemony, gold, Bitcoin or any other store-of-value assets would experience a surge in its price. Young Ju argued that there is no perceived threat to American dominance since many investors still have great confidence in the US economy or the US dollar. The crypto executive believes the debate on the Bitcoin reserve would only gain serious momentum if the country’s global economic dominance is “genuinely threatened,” adding, “At present, market sentiment suggests confidence in the US’ continued supremacy.” The US processed 37.8% of the world’s Bitcoin in 2022, making it the leader in crypto mining, according to government data. Young Ju said that it is possible that Trump’s stance on Bitcoin may take an unexpected turn depending on the broader political landscape. “If Trump succeeds in showcasing US economic resilience, reinforcing the dollar’s supremacy, and boosting his approval ratings, it’s unclear if he would maintain the strong pro-Bitcoin stance he demonstrated during his campaign,” he explained in a post. The CryptoQuant CEO suggested that more likely, Trump would “step back from his Bitcoin advocacy,” pointing out that he might cite that there has been a change in priorities, “without alienating his voter base.” For the crypto executive, it is still unsure which of Trump’s “campaign rhetoric on Bitcoin” will be fulfilled.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Title: Why Harley-Davidson, Inc. (HOG) Is the Top Luxury Stock According to Hedge Funds

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Top 12 Luxury Stocks According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Harley-Davidson, Inc. (NYSE:HOG) stands against other luxury stocks according to hedge funds. According to a report by Mordor Intelligence, the luxury goods market has a size of $103.10 billion as of 2024. It is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.07% and reach $145.08 billion by 2029. Similarly, a study by Global Market Insights published on Yahoo! Finance shows that the luxury packaging market was valued at $17.2 billion in 2023. It is also anticipated to grow and reach $25.8 billion by the end of 2032. North America’s demand for luxury products is significantly high, primarily due to the region’s high disposable incomes. This is especially significant in the ongoing holiday shopping season in the US. On December 17, Simeon Siegel, BMO Capital Markets senior analyst for retail and e-commerce, appeared on CNBC to discuss the state of the consumer in the current holiday shopping season. He said that the US consumer is overly resilient. In the current scenario, the market is seeing winners grow and laggers fall behind, which is how it should be. This trend goes opposite to market dynamics in COVID-19 when every company grew. Siegel was further of the view that the consumers are still spending. For better and for worse, consumers are scared of not having something under the Christmas tree this year. On December 10, CNBC’s Steve Liesman appeared on ‘Squawk Box’ to discuss the CNBC NRF Retail Monitor. Numbers from the Monitor corroborated Siegel’s claim and showed healthy consumer spending in November despite a shorter holiday shopping season in 2024. Non-store retailers showed a 21.5% year-over-year growth, reflecting these positive trends. Since this holiday shopping season came with lower gas prices and a deflation in the prices of goods overall, consumers had more discretionary dollars in their pockets and paid somewhat less compared to a year ago. Since luxury items fall in the category of discretionary items, these trends show positive stimulus for the industry. We discussed consumer behavior in the ongoing holiday shopping season in a recently published article on the 7 best department store stocks to buy now. Here is an excerpt from the article: “The holiday shopping season is in full swing in the United States. On December 2, Jessica Moulton, senior partner at McKinsey & Company, appeared on CNBC to discuss Black Friday spending and its effects on consumer sentiment. She said that while 2024 was a challenging year for retailers, the numbers rolling in from the holiday season seem promising. High hopes were especially placed on Black Friday sales, and while the numbers aren’t all in, they look pretty good. This trend holds particularly true online, where sales seem to be up by 15% or so compared to last year in many markets. According to CNBC, the total Black Friday e-commerce spending was around $10.8 billion. However, Moulton said that footfall in stores wasn’t so good, and continued to be flat year-over-year. On December 2, Mastercard Economics Institute chief economist Michelle Meyer appeared on CNBC to discuss industry trends and said that consumers have been geared to find value and best deals. She said that the Black Friday numbers show that consumers have been monitoring the market and gearing up to spend on the Black Friday weekend. With inflation cooling and promotions returning, consumers are focused on finding the best deals in the market that offer value at a discount. This was one of the major motivating factors that drove considerably strong spending in e-commerce during the Black Friday weekend. Apparel, jewelry, and electronics remain the top gift sectors for the holidays, but consumers are prioritizing promotions with the greatest value instead of going ahead with brand loyalty. Meyer was of the view that consumers have the ability and the willingness to spend; they are just being savvy with their expenses by spending when promotions and deals come in. We sifted through stock screeners, online rankings, and ETFs to compile a list of 30 luxury stocks. We then selected the top 12 most popular stocks among elite hedge funds as of Q3 2024. We sourced the hedge fund sentiment data from Insider Monkey’s database. The list is sorted in ascending order of hedge fund sentiment. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 23 Harley-Davidson, Inc. (NYSE:HOG) operates Harley-Davidson Motor Company (HDMC) and Harley-Davidson Financial Services. HDMC manufactures and designs luxury Harley-Davidson motorcycles, motorcycle parts, apparel, and accessories. It operates globally, with operations in the EMEA region, Asia, the United States, Canada, Asia Pacific, and Latin America. The company experienced a challenging global market environment in fiscal Q3 2024 due to macroeconomic and political uncertainty and the pressure of high interest rates affecting its industry and customers. As a result, its global retail sales of new motorcycles dropped by 13% in fiscal Q3 2024. North America saw a 10% decline, compared to 18% across international regions. Overall, Harley-Davidson, Inc. (NYSE:HOG) is seeing greater spending from higher-income customers. Its motorcycle mix corroborates this, with CVO motorcycles up double-digital percentages throughout 2024. The company’s touring segment in the United States was up by around 10% through the end of fiscal Q3 2024. This growth was driven by its new touring lineup. It gained more than four percentage points of market share, outperforming the category, its other segments, and the market as a whole. Harley-Davidson, Inc. (NYSE:HOG) ranks 12th on our list of the top 12 luxury stocks according to hedge funds. Artisan Select Equity Fund stated the following regarding Harley-Davidson, Inc. (NYSE:HOG) in its Q2 2024 investor letter: “The biggest detractors from performance during the quarter were Harley-Davidson, Inc. (NYSE:HOG), Henry Schein and Expedia. Harley’s share price declined 23% during the quarter after a strong run in Q1. We had significantly reduced our position at higher share prices over the past 12–18 months. The shares have been weak over concerns that higher interest rates are impacting affordability and retail sales. We share these concerns. Harley is likely to reduce its forecasts for the year when it reports, though this now appears to be discounted in the valuation. Famous last words. The shares now trade at a single-digit multiple of earnings. We believe the brand is strong, and management is able to adjust production and costs to meet various demand environments. If interest rates begin to decline as anticipated, demand should improve.” Overall, HOG ranks 12th on our list of luxury stocks according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of luxury stocks, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than HOG but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Stocks like Tesla and Nvidia now make up a huge chunk of the S&P 500's total value, exposing investors to heavy losses if they tumble. First Foundation (FFWM) is technically in oversold territory now, so the heavy selling pressure might have exhausted.

Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 75 Nike, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) designs, markets, and distributes luxury athletic footwear, accessories, equipment, and services for sports and fitness activities. Its operating segments span EMEA, Greater China, APLA, and North America. The company also designs products specifically for the Converse and Jordan brands. Several of its products are valued at thousands of dollars. Nike, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) is considered one of the top luxury fashion brands, and has a market cap of $113.75 billion. Nike, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) reported a decline of 8% in its revenues on a reported basis and a 9% decline on a currency-neutral basis in fiscal Q2 2025. This decline was primarily due to the ongoing headwinds from the company’s franchise management actions. It is shifting its product portfolio by reducing the proportion of its business driven by its classic footwear franchises, including Air Jordan 1, Air Force 1, and Dunk. This caused a reduction in revenues from these franchises as the company continued to tighten its marketplace supply. These franchises decelerated faster than the company’s business in fiscal Q2 2025, at a rate greater than fiscal Q1 2025. The company is actively rebalancing product allocations to its highest traffic channel to maximize full-price realization and franchise health. The company is driving the biggest reductions to its classic footwear franchises on NIKE Direct, which fell 14% with NIKE Digital declining 21% and NIKE Stores declining 2%. However, the company also saw momentum build with positive physical and digital traffic. Black Friday week proved to be the largest demand week ever on NIKE Digital with sales increasing by double-digits. Similarly, 11/11 sales exceeded company plans in Greater China. Fiscal Q2 2025 thus reflected progress in key areas, with the company gaining consumer support. ClearBridge Large Cap Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) in its Q2 2024 investor letter: “Other moves during the quarter included sales of United Parcel Service (UPS) and NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE). Nike has become overly reliant on key platforms, like Jordan, for revenue growth while innovation in areas like running has lagged. Nike could face continued revenue and profit pressure as it invests to re-invigorate innovation and re-position the business back toward wholesale outlets. As such, we are seeking out better ways to participate in the global consumer recovery in companies where earnings estimates have already reset.” Overall, NKE ranks first on our list of luxury stocks according to hedge funds.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of the 11 Best Renewable Energy Stocks To Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where First Solar, Inc. (NASDAQ:FSLR) stands against the other best renewable energy stocks to buy now. The future of President Joe Biden’s landmark climate legislation, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) plays a significant role in promoting renewable energy by offering a wide range of tax incentives and funding mechanisms to encourage investment in clean energy technologies, including solar, wind, and geothermal power, hangs in the balance as the incoming Republican-controlled White House, Senate, and House of Representatives prepare to take office in 2025. However, an area of concern is the future of the Department of Energy’s Loan Programs Office (LPO), which provides financing for green energy projects. The LPO has been instrumental in funding large-scale renewable energy projects and it expanded significantly under the IRA. However, Trump’s appointees, particularly Wright, who has expressed skepticism about the climate crisis, may be inclined to scale back or dismantle this program entirely, which could have a significant impact on the green energy sector.

In an interview with Bloomberg on December 23, Tom Steyer, Co-Founder of Galvanize Climate Solutions, a climate-focused global investment firm, discussed the role of renewable energy in the United States. Steyer emphasized that while the year 2025 is often discussed in the context of climate regulations, it is more accurately about meeting the growing energy demand. He argued that renewable energy should be at the center of any energy bill, regardless of political persuasion. Steyer highlighted that market costs are the primary drivers of the energy transition to renewables. He cited the fact that in 2023, 86% of new electricity generation was predominantly from renewable sources, driven by economic rather than purely environmental considerations. Steyer pointed out that the phrase “drill, baby, drill” might still be part of the political conversation, but the cost differential between renewable and fossil fuels drives the reality. He noted that renewables are now cheaper than fossil fuels and are becoming increasingly cost-effective. For instance, the cost of natural gas in the U.S. has risen to nearly double its previous levels, while in Europe, it is even higher. However, the cheapest electricity is increasingly coming from renewable sources, both in the U.S. and globally. This economic reality is driving business decisions, international competitiveness, and national security by industries such as tech, that require large amounts of electricity and are increasingly turning to renewables to meet their energy needs. When asked about the potential impact of deregulation in the energy sector, Steyer suggested that deregulation could help accelerate the adoption of renewables if it includes faster permitting and lower oversight for all energy projects, including renewables. He noted that the Trump administration’s push for faster permits and reduced oversight for oil and gas drilling could extended to renewables, and will lead to a significant expansion of low-cost, abundant renewable energy. Regarding nuclear energy, Steyer acknowledged its potential but noted the challenges associated with cost, safety, and public perception. He pointed out that nuclear energy has historically been expensive, with the last nuclear plant in Georgia costing at least four times its original estimate. While nuclear energy could provide a stable baseload power source, the high costs and safety concerns have made it a less attractive option compared to renewables. As the United States enters 2025, the future of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) remains uncertain under a Republican government. However, the cost-effectiveness of renewable energy compared to fossil fuels makes it increasingly dominant in the global energy mix.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Low Priced Technology Stocks To Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Sabre Corporation (NASDAQ:SABR) stands against the other low-priced technology stocks. The technology sector plays a crucial role in the modern economy, encompassing a wide range of industries. This sector can include businesses involved in electronics, software, artificial intelligence (AI), and information technology, among others. As companies increasingly rely on technological innovations to enhance productivity and efficiency, the technology sector is poised for growth as it becomes essential for both consumers and businesses. Recent trends indicate a significant shift towards AI, cloud computing, and cybersecurity as key drivers of growth. Enterprise spending in these areas is expected to increase, driving growth in the global tech market. Generative AI is becoming more important than ever as a vital tool for many organizations, marking a significant shift from experimentation to practical application. According to the latest McKinsey Global Survey on AI, conducted in the first half of 2024, 65% of respondents indicated that their companies are now regularly utilizing generative AI, nearly double the figure from just ten months prior. This surge in adoption reflects a growing belief in the technology’s potential, with 75% of respondents anticipating that generative AI will bring about substantial changes in their industries in the coming years. The overall adoption of AI has also seen a notable increase, rising from around 50% to 72% over the past year. Technology-oriented stocks are set to achieve another impressive year by the end of 2024, according to U.S. Bank Asset Management. As of mid-December, the S&P 500 Communication Services and Information Technology index has risen over 40% year-to-date, following a remarkable 57% increase in 2023. Although technology stock performance slowed down in the third quarter of 2024, it regained momentum in the fourth quarter. According to Rob Haworth, senior investment strategy director for U.S. Bank Asset Management, corporate investments in artificial intelligence (AI) applications continue to drive this growth, even though the pace of AI spending eased slightly in the third quarter. Investors are attracted to the tech sector because of its innovative nature. Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist with U.S. Bank Asset Management, emphasizes that technology is crucial for improving speed and efficiency across various industries. While the sector can experience short-term fluctuations, Sandven remains confident about its long-term prospects, as companies seek growth through technology rather than simply hiring more staff. Haworth shares this optimism, noting that technology stocks are central to current economic expansion and benefit significantly from business capital investments. However, he notes that investors still need to be careful in their approach to this sector. While some tech startups achieve great success, others may fail to get off the ground. To compile our list of the 10 best low-priced technology stocks to buy now, we used the Finviz stock screener. We sorted our results based on market capitalization and picked the top 25 technology companies with a share price of under $10 as of December 24, 2024. Next, we focused on the top 10 stocks most favored by institutional investors. Data for the hedge fund sentiment surrounding each stock was taken from Insider Monkey’s Q3 2024 database of 900 elite hedge funds. The 10 best low-priced technology stocks to buy now were then ranked in ascending order based on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them as of Q3 2024. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

Title: Is Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (ADM) Among the Undervalued Dividend Aristocrats to Buy According to Hedge Funds?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Undervalued Dividend Aristocrats To Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) stands against the other undervalued dividend aristocrats to buy according to hedge funds. A dividend aristocrat is an S&P 500 company that not only maintains regular dividend payments to shareholders but also increases its payouts annually. To qualify as a dividend aristocrat, a company must raise its dividends consistently for at least 25 consecutive years. Michael Clarfeld, Portfolio Manager at ClearBridge, recently talked about why companies that consistently grow their dividends are well-positioned to handle the challenges of 2025. With rising costs, tighter margins, higher interest rates, and inflation on the horizon, Clarfeld is still optimistic about the economy. He pointed to strong employment numbers, upbeat consumer sentiment, and confident businesses, especially after the election. Pro-business policies under the Trump administration could drive investments and growth, which sounds great, but there’s a catch. For instance, bringing manufacturing back to the US would create jobs and boost wages, but it could also increase business costs. After two strong years, Clarfeld doesn’t see much room for big capital gains in 2025. Plus, with inflation sticking around, the Federal Reserve is likely to take a more cautious approach. That said, he sees opportunities in sectors like European and global consumer staples and US energy infrastructure. Clarfeld is a big fan of dividend growth stocks, calling them a timeless investment. They can act as a safety net during volatile markets and provide steady income, which is especially useful when capital appreciation feels out of reach. He also highlighted how dividends help protect your purchasing power by keeping up with inflation. In his view, dividend growth is a smart and reliable strategy for navigating a potentially bumpy 2025. Paul Baiocchi of SS&C ALPS Advisors sees dividend investing as a smart move, expecting the Fed to ease rates. According to Baiocchi, investors are shifting from money markets and fixed income to dividend-paying stocks, especially companies with leverage that could benefit from lower interest rates. Similarly, Mike Akins of ETF Action also sees dividend ETFs as a defensive play, highlighting that the companies included typically have strong balance sheets. He notes the growing popularity of dividend-focused ETFs, suggesting that consistent dividends give investors confidence in a company’s stability and financial health. Both experts agree that dividends offer a sense of durability and drawdown protection in uncertain markets. A wheat field at sunset, showing the company's commitment to agricultural commodities. In this article, we selected stocks from the Dividend Aristocrats List that had a P/E ratio below 20 as of December 23. Our focus was on identifying stocks with the strongest hedge fund sentiment in Q3 2024 among the 66 Dividend Aristocrats that also met our P/E criteria. The stocks are ranked below in ascending order based on the number of hedge fund holders for each company. At Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Dividend Yield as of December 23: 3.79% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 34 P/E Ratio: 14.18 Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) is a global leader in the procurement, transportation, storage, and processing of agricultural commodities, with operations in several countries, including the US, Switzerland, Brazil, and the UK. Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) handles agricultural raw materials like oilseeds, offers a wide range of food and animal feed products, and produces ingredients for different industries, such as food, energy, and chemicals. It also provides specialized products like proteins, natural flavors, and pet food. Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) reported a challenging third quarter in 2024, with net earnings of $18 million and adjusted net earnings of $530 million. Earnings per share were $0.04, while adjusted earnings per share came in at $1.09, both down from the previous year. A non-cash charge of $461 million related to its Wilmar equity investment impacted GAAP earnings. The company also experienced an 8% drop in revenue, totaling $20 billion for the quarter, missing analyst estimates by $1.57 billion. Despite these setbacks, ADM's cash flow remained strong, with operating cash flow reaching $2.5 billion year-to-date, up from $1.9 billion the previous year. ADM also remains committed to its long-standing tradition of dividend growth, with 51 consecutive years of increases and a current quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share. As per Insider Monkey’s third-quarter database, 34 hedge funds were long Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM), compared to 35 funds in the last quarter. Overall, ADM ranks 5th on our list of the undervalued dividend aristocrats to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of ADM to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than ADM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: AI data centers are making your electricity supply worse and could damage your home, new study says
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/ai-data-centers-electricity-supply-risk-2024-12
Time Published: 2024-12-29T19:59:31Z

Data centers in the United States are consuming so much power that they may be impacting the flow of electricity to millions of Americans. AI data centers are sprouting up across the country to meet the increased demand for AI, but they're also sucking up the power on which millions of Americans rely. The new tech is demanding massive amounts of energy from grids that are, in some areas, already stressed. Researchers have estimated that AI centers could need three to five times the power used by traditional facilities, Business Insider previously reported. A Bloomberg analysis assessed readings from some 770,000 homes from February to October and found that over 75% of "highly distorted power readings across the country are within 50 miles of significant data center activity." Stresses on the power grid can lead to inconsistent power quality, and as the power quality decreases, the risk increases, Bloomberg reported. Inconsistent energy flow can cause electronics to overheat, leading to sparks or even house fires. A small handful of large tech companies own the vast majority of global data centers — and they show no signs of slowing down as they pour billions into building more powerful AI models. Amazon, Google, and Microsoft own about 65% of the cloud infrastructure market, which includes data centers, according to a 2023 report from market research firm Synergy Research Group. Google announced in April that it's investing $3 billion to build and expand data centers in Virginia and Indiana. The search engine giant unveiled its latest AI model, Gemini 2.0, in December. Amazon, which is a large investor in AI startup Anthropic, is investing another $10 billion in Ohio data centers, Gov. Mike DeWine announced on December 16. Microsoft, which has invested $13 billion in ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, said in September that the company has partnered with other investors, including BlackRock, in a $100 billion energy infrastructure project. The project will include "new and expanded data centers," the company said. To meet AI's increasing energy demands, companies like Google have also started turning to nuclear power to find more reliable and sustainable energy sources. Jump to

Title: Jim Cramer on Intel Corporation (INTC): ‘Better Than Ever. Don’t Worry About It’

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published an article titled Jim Cramer's Bold Predictions About These 15 AI Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) stands against the other AI stocks Jim Cramer talked about. As trading in 2024 heads towards a close, major stock market indexes have had a good run despite mixed performance across sectors. The flagship S&P index is up 26% year-to-date while the broader NASDAQ index has gained 33.56%. On top of this, the index of the NASDAQ's top 100 stocks is up 29.8%, which solidifies the conclusion that technology stocks have driven the stock market's 2024 returns. For further evidence, consider the Dow's performance. The stock index which tracks industries across the US economy is up 14% YTD, making it the weakest-performing index among all mentioned. However, even within technology, not all stocks have performed equally well. As an example, consider the performance of two stocks. Both of these are semiconductor companies. The first, which ranked 3rd on our list of Jim Cramer's bearish tech calls is the largest American manufacturer of memory chips. The second, which ranked 1st on the same list is Wall Street's AI darling. The two stocks have gained 7.64% and 184.60% year-to-date, so even though both of them are technology companies, their share price returns have differed primarily because of the firms' varying exposures to artificial intelligence. Yet even though AI has held up the stock market in 2024, other factors continue to influence stock performance as well. Continuing with our example of the GPU designer's shares, the stock dropped by 1.1% on the day the Federal Reserve cut interest rates but guided two cuts for 2024 instead of the earlier four. The shares fell despite the fact that the firm enjoys the widest moat possible in the AI industry. On the same day, the flagship S&P and the broader NASDAQ indexes shed 2.9% and 3.6%, respectively. Following the year-end sell-off on Friday, neither index has fully recovered to levels before the Fed's announcement. Cramer, for his part, had predicted that the markets might not find it easy to reverse all losses following the Fed's announcement. Talking on CNBC's Squawk on the Street on the day after the Fed's decision, the host shared that "rampant Bitcoin speculation, after speculation in nuclear power, after speculation in quantum computing" was baked into markets ahead of the announcement. Commenting on quantum computing in particular, Cramer mentioned one quantum computing stock and wondered whether the industry was all hype and no substance. "How is that [the firm] going to quantum? When we don’t even know what quantum is?" wondered Cramer. "It’s a nonfungible tokens, right? Cause you know what a fungible token was?” he added. As AI continues to shape the winners and losers in the stock market, Cramer also shared tips for trading in 2025 in a recent Mad Money episode. He believes that one key fact that everyone needs to keep in mind when trading is to not get disillusioned by strong gains. According to Cramer, while bulls and bears both "make money" on the stock market, it's the pigs that "get slaughtered." He elaborated further and shared that in his experience he's "seen moments where stocks went up and up and up so much that people were intoxicated with their gains." Yet, it's "precisely at that point of intoxication that you need to remind yourself that you don’t want to act like a pig," believes the television show host. Cramer's second tip for successful investing is to have the fortitude to hold stocks even when the market is tough. He believes that not only is holding through the thick and thin 'the hardest part of investing," but adds that "taking short-term pains so you can have long-term gains" lies at the heart of the market's performance "for a century.” Finally, one key factor that several people ignore while trading stocks is to hunt for the right entry price. Cramer cautions against buying in bulk. "Do not, under any circumstances, buy your whole position at once," he stresses and adds that "you should never sell all at once," either. Instead, Cramer recommends staging "your buys, work your orders, try to get the best price over time.” Our Methodology To compile our list of Jim Cramer's bold predictions about AI stocks, we scanned the stocks he mentioned in Mad Money and Squawk on the Street as far back as in August. Then, we picked out stocks with AI computing, hardware, and energy generation exposure, and ranked them by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q3 2024. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A technician soldering components for a semiconductor board. Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 68 Date of Cramer’s Comments: 08-12-24 Performance Since Then: -0.83% Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) is the world's largest integrated chip manufacturer. While its business model of designing and manufacturing chips provides it with a clear advantage in the industry, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) has struggled in 2024. The firm's AI chips have failed to compete with NVIDIA's offerings, and sluggishness in the personal computing market has hit its revenues right when it's investing in retaking the chip manufacturing process technology lead from Taiwan's TSMC. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC)'s shares are down 57.5% year-to-date, and it's exiting 2024 with more turmoil in the form of former CEO Patrick Gelsinger's surprising exit. Cramer started out his comments about Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) with sarcasm and then pointed out its troubles: "Intel's fine. Better than ever. Don't worry about it. I keep hearing that Intel's gonna make a huge comeback that is catching up the others in the data center. That the data center has an Nvidia killer in GE-3. That it's using the chips to sack money from you and further it's dominance. DREAM ON! Have you seen Intel's balance sheet? Can you read one? Do you think a company that cut his dividend last year and then suspends what was left of it this year in order to assert its dominance?! Look, this is not the Intel of old even though we want it to be. Despite Intel's protestations, I wouldn't want to be Intel's partner." Overall INTC ranks 12th on our list of the AI stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about. While we acknowledge the potential of INTC as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than INTC but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

When we don’t even know what quantum is?" wondered Cramer. "It’s a nonfungible tokens, right? Cause you know what a fungible token was?” he added. As AI continues to shape the winners and losers in the stock market, Cramer also shared tips for trading in 2025 in a recent Mad Money episode. He believes that one key fact that everyone needs to keep in mind when trading is to not get disillusioned by strong gains. According to Cramer, while bulls and bears both "make money" on the stock market, it's the pigs that "get slaughtered." He elaborated further and shared that in his experience he's "seen moments where stocks went up and up and up so much that people were intoxicated with their gains." Yet, it's "precisely at that point of intoxication that you need to remind yourself that you don’t want to act like a pig," believes the television show host. Cramer's second tip for successful investing is to have the fortitude to hold stocks even when the market is tough. He believes that not only is holding through the thick and thin 'the hardest part of investing," but adds that "taking short-term pains so you can have long-term gains" lies at the heart of the market's performance "for a century.” Finally, one key factor that several people ignore while trading stocks is to hunt for the right entry price. Cramer cautions against buying in bulk. "Do not, under any circumstances, buy your whole position at once," he stresses and adds that "you should never sell all at once," either. Instead, Cramer recommends staging "your buys, work your orders, try to get the best price over time.” Our Methodology To compile our list of Jim Cramer's bold predictions about AI stocks, we scanned the stocks he mentioned in Mad Money and Squawk on the Street as far back as in August. Then, we picked out stocks with AI computing, hardware, and energy generation exposure, and ranked them by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q3 2024. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A circuit breaker installed in a control panel illuminated by bright LEDs. Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 26 Date of Cramer’s Comments: 8-19-24 Performance Since Then: 35.10% Powell Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ:POWL) is an electrical infrastructure company whose products are used in data centers that compute AI workloads. It's one of the top-performing stocks of 2024 due to strong revenue growth stemming from tailwinds in the data center and utilities markets. Powell Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ:POWL)'s revenue grew by 45% during its fiscal year 2024, and the shares are up by 156% year-to-date. One key factor that has driven investor optimism in the firm's stock is its backlog. A robust backlog lets investors gain visibility into future orders. As of its fiscal Q4, Powell Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ:POWL)'s backlog remained steady at $1.4 billion. Cramer commented on the backlog and other factors surrounding the firm: "Lately, the market has fallen in love with a particular kind of industrial stock. These are still smokestack stocks, but they also have powerful secular growth drivers, meaning they can thrive even if the economy doesn't accelerate. Tonight, I have a smaller company that falls into the same category: Powell Industries. This company has been around since 1947 and went public decades ago. However, the stock has caught my attention over the past couple of years, skyrocketing from $20 in late September 2022 to $171 today—a gain of more than 700%. So, what does this company do, and how did the stock manage to catch fire like this? More importantly, can it keep running once the Fed starts blessing us with rate hikes? Overall POWL ranks 15th on our list of the AI stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about. While we acknowledge the potential of POWL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than POWL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: 2024: The Extraordinary Year When Bitcoin Went Mainstream

A view of the New Year's Eve '2024' Numerals, to be lit up at midnight on December 31, in New York's ... [+] world-famous Times Square in United States on December 20, 2023. (Photo by Lokman Vural Elibol/Anadolu via Getty Images) History will remember 2024 as the year bitcoin transformed from a niche investment to a mainstream asset. With its dollar exchange rate breaking the symbolic $100,000 mark, and the largest financial firms in the world embracing a bitcoin strategy, the orange coin can no longer be dismissed. You can still think whatever you want about bitcoin, you just can’t ignore it. The new year promises many exciting possibilities such as adoption at the highest levels of government, expansion of bitcoin’s use as an institutional treasury asset, an overhaul of regulation to make the U.S. more friendly to financial innovation, and geopolitical dynamics that propel bitcoin into a new era. In January, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved 11 spot bitcoin ETFs – a moment that will likely be viewed as a watershed in financial history. For years, the SEC resisted bitcoin ETFs, citing concerns over market manipulation and investor protections. The approval marked a decisive shift in the agency’s stance, sending billions of dollars in liquidity into the market and boosting confidence in bitcoin as a legitimate asset class. Their launch was the most successful in the history of ETFs and now hold more assets under management than gold ETFs. BlackRock iShares ETF AUM: Gold vs. Bitcoin. (CryptoQuant) These ETFs have provided an open door for new sources of liquidity to enter into the bitcoin markets, since certain pools of capital cannot be converted to physical bitcoin, but can purchase regulated financial products like ETFs. Perhaps even more crucially, bitcoin ETFs have normalized bitcoin as an investment. Pension funds, retirement accounts, and institutional portfolios – and the financial advisors that manage them – now have a way to achieve bitcoin exposure with the same ease as stocks, bonds, and other instruments. Institutional adoption of bitcoin reached unprecedented levels in 2024. BNY Mellon, America’s oldest bank, gained SEC approval to offer bitcoin custody services, a move signaling that even the most conservative institutions now recognize bitcoin’s staying power. Meanwhile, BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, received approval for the iShares Bitcoin Trust to offer spot bitcoin ETF options. This paved the way for more efficient price discovery, which may dampen price volatility in 2025. Although volatility is not inherently bad, it does prevent certain types of investors from entering the market. A meaningful reduction in volatility may lead in turn to higher confidence in the asset, leading to yet more inflows, and thus more price discovery, further dampened volatility, and so on, establishing a virtuous cycle of adoption and appreciation of bitcoin as an asset class. Bitcoin’s mainstream moment was also catalyzed by visionary corporate leaders. MicroStrategy, already renowned as a bitcoin pioneer, announced an audacious plan to raise $42 billion over three years to expand its bitcoin holdings. Since that announcement, the company has already filed additional paperwork with the SEC to issue yet more shares, to buy yet more bitcoin. Microstrategy’s treasury operations are a fascinating financial innovation that will be studied for years to come. Inspired by MicroStrategy’s leadership, a handful of other companies followed suit in 2024, including Semler Scientific, Metaplanet, and others. In fact, in just the past few days, new filings with the SEC reveal several new bitcoin ETFs on the horizon: There’s no other way to say it – in one of the most contentious presidential elections in U.S. history, Americans elected a pro-bitcoin president in a landslide. On his path to retake the White House, Donald Trump spoke openly of his support for bitcoin, and even delivered a historic keynote speech at the Bitcoin Conference in Nashville. Key Trump administration members have vocalized support for bitcoin, including RFK Jr., Tulsi Gabbard, Don Jr., Vivek Ramaswamy, and others. At the same time, congress is getting into the game, with U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis championing a proposal to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR). An SBR would position the United States as a global leader in sound money, leveraging bitcoin as both a hedge and an asset of geopolitical significance – and could even help restore separation of powers within the federal government. With the incoming administration facing significant economic challenges, it is a good thing that bitcoin is rightly viewed as a tool for meeting them. As we approach the end of 2024, bitcoin’s market capitalization has surpassed silver and even Saudi Aramco, one of the world’s most valuable companies. With the momentary passing of the $100,000 price milestone, questions naturally arise about what the price will be a year from now. The events of 2024 suggest that the momentum is far from over. Institutional adoption continues to accelerate, regulators are becoming more bitcoin-friendly, and public interest is growing. With these tailwinds, 2025 may well see continued price appreciation. Numbers like $250,000 and $475,000 are often shared. Chamath Palihapitiya has modeled a price for bitcoin of $500,000 to $1.14 million over the course of the current halving epoch, which ends in 2028. With so many variables affecting the price, it’s hard to set any solid expectations. Luckily, we don’t have to – bitcoin is an asset that is best used to build generational wealth slowly and steadily over the long term. Bitcoin’s CAGR is about 25% to 40% over a five year period. This means that price action, even over the course of two or three years, should be considered short-term. The best way to build wealth with bitcoin is to put aside money you do not need to access for at least five years, and set up a savings strategy that’s customized to your needs. The extraordinary events of 2024 have made one thing abundantly clear: bitcoin is a household name that’s here to stay. Its monetary properties offer a resilience and reliability that no other asset can. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

Title: Jim Cramer on Visa Inc. (V): ‘I’m Waiting For Visa To Come Down At A Discount’

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer's Bold Predictions About These 10 Financial Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) stands against the other financial stocks Jim Cramer talked about. Before and after the Federal Reserve's interest rate cut earlier this month, Jim Cramer had plenty to say on the subject matter. Ahead of the Fed's announcement, the CNBC host wondered why investors were reading too much into the Fed's interest rate cut decisions. In an episode of Squawk on the Street, Cramer stated that it wasn't clear to him why "people want to be very concerned about the future after the cut, I really am not buying any of this." Another pressing issue that's caught his attention is the incoming Trump Administration's proposed tariffs against China and other US trading partners. He linked tariffs with interest rate cuts and the consumer price index (CPI) or inflation. One of the biggest concerns among analysts and economists, when it comes to tariffs, is the extent to which they might influence prices. Cramer believes that the Fed might not cut interest rates if the tariffs cause prices to rise. On the flip side, he added that if there aren't any tariffs or if the incoming administration is selective about them, then the housing market might pick up again and auto sales could rise. Additionally, Cramer also speculated that even if the tariffs did cause inflation, "a year we’ll be sitting here and saying well, okay we had this blip up inflation but that’s over." As a result, he believes that investors should focus more on the Trump administration's policies instead of the Fed. "Why do we have to focus so much on what’s going to happen next year for the Fed when they actually have to react to what the President does?” he asked. The need to focus on the Fed did become clear soon after Cramer's comments. In a highly watched mid-December decision, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell announced that while his organization was cutting interest rates by 25 basis points, it might cut rates just twice in 2025 as opposed to the earlier guidance of four cuts. On the day Chair Powell updated investors about the bank's outlook, the flagship S&P, the Dow, and the broader NASDAQ stock indexes lost 2.95%, 2.58%, and 3.56%, respectively. Cramer, unsurprisingly, wasn't short on words when it came to dissecting the Fed's decision. Speaking on Mad Money on the day of the rate cut, he shared that Powell was caught off guard by having to fulfill market expectations of an interest rate cut that might not be justified given the strength of the US economy. According to Cramer, when it came to the rate cut the "data didn’t back it up. It would have been much better off if they had explicitly taken a wait-and-see approach before this meeting. This time they telegraphed the wrong thing. Hence today’s meltdown.” The next day, he shared that it would have been better if the Fed hadn't "set us up, not told certain people in the media, whatever, that we need a cut." Yet, even though Cramer believes that America's economic strength did not warrant an interest rate cut, he isn't convinced that the economy is strong all over. On Squawk on the Street ahead of the interest rate cut, Cramer wondered where the Atlanta Fed had gotten its 3.2% US GDP growth estimate for Q4. “I don’t know where these people get that things are strong, they look at the aggregate numbers, I look at the individual companies, I am trying to find companies that are strong,” he outlined and added that he's "trying to find why. I’m trying to find where" the GDP is growing by 3.2%. Cramer speculated "travel’s very strong yeah. Leisure’s very strong. Dining out’s very strong. These are strong and by the way, they’re very obvious, they look obvious to the Atlanta Fed. I don’t know what kind of weighting they have but wow.” Cramer's comments about the economy and the Fed's future actions are particularly important when we talk about financial services stocks. These firms typically do well when consumer spending isn't constrained by inflation and interest rates are low to facilitate business lending, deal-making, and other activities.

Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 165 Date of Cramer’s Comments: 10-07-24/10-08-24 Performance Since Then: 14.8% Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) is the largest credit card processor in the US as it commands 61% of the US market by purchase volume. As a result, the stock is dependent on consumer spending strength and low rates to drive higher transaction volumes. Higher spending led Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) to beat analyst revenue estimates of $9.49 billion in Q3 by posting $9.62 billion. Its shares soared by 2.9% after the earnings and then gained another 4.8% after President-elect Trump's victory in the November election. Over the long term, Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) might have to pick up the pace with its global expansion efforts to counter the threat of fintech upstarts eating away its market share. The firm is also being sued by the Justice Department for alleged monopolistic practices and is on the backfoot when it comes to a $30 billion settlement with merchants. Here's what Cramer said in October: “… Look, it sells at 27 times earnings. I’m waiting for Visa to come down at a discount. You don’t have that. Right now, I have to tell you, Mastercard is actually doing a little better than Visa. But no, no need to add a position on that. That’s not the right basis. Just keep looking. It’s a great long-term stock and I think it always will be as long as this is well run as it is now.” Overall V ranks 1st on our list of the financial stocks Jim Cramer talked about. While we acknowledge the potential of V as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than V but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

(NYSE:BRK-B) is Warren Buffett's investment holding company with stakes in a variety of businesses. The firm's largest business is its insurance division closely followed by its utility and energy operations. Despite the well-diversified business model with stakes in railroad, construction, and energy, Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B) nevertheless depends on robust economic performance for its share price gains. Therefore, it was unsurprising that the stock fell by 2% after the Fed's interest rate decisions and soared by 5.4% after the November election.
