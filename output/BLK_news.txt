IBIT holdings surge as BlackRock's broader Bitcoin exposure strategy unfolds. BlackRock expanded its exposure to Bitcoin-linked assets in the first quarter of 2025, pushing its total investments to more than $5.4 billion, according to data from Timechainindex. Between the last quarter of 2024 and March 2025, BlackRock added over 3.2 million shares of the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) to its portfolio. This move brought its total IBIT holdings to around 5.85 million shares, valued at roughly $274 million. In an interesting shift, BlackRock also began investing in rival spot Bitcoin ETFs. It purchased nearly 71,000 shares of Fidelity’s FBTC and made smaller allocations to Grayscale’s GBTC and GBTC Mini products. This marks the firm’s first foray into rival ETFs, reflecting a broader strategy aimed at tapping into multiple channels of Bitcoin market exposure. Combined, these holdings are valued at more than $5 million. Altogether, BlackRock’s total position in spot Bitcoin ETFs has reached approximately $279 million. At the same time, the firm increased its exposure to companies with direct ties to Bitcoin. The asset management firm increased its stake in Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) to over 14.4 million shares during the quarter. The firm also acquired more than 620,000 of MicroStrategy’s Series A preferred shares and nearly 15 million shares across two of the company’s commercial notes. These positions bring BlackRock’s total exposure to Strategy to over $4.23 billion. Meanwhile, BlackRock also deepened its positions in Bitcoin mining companies, pushing its investments in these cohorts to almost $1 billion, with investments in Riot Platforms, Marathon Digital, TeraWulf, and others.

Title: Stablecoins Could Soon Replace China As Top U.S. Creditor

ByJon Helgi Egilsson ByJon Helgi Egilsson, Contributor. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent views stablecoins as a strategic tool to boost U.S. Treasury demand ... More and strengthen dollar dominance. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin) A powerful U.S. Treasury advisory group sees stablecoins emerging as a major new source of demand for government debt. With the market projected to reach $2 trillion by 2028—nearly all of it dollar-denominated. At its meeting last week, the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee —comprising senior executives from BlackRock, JPMorgan, and other major financial institutions reporting to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessen—highlighted the stablecoin market as a rapidly expanding force in creating new Treasury demand. The implication is clear: current regulatory proposals could channel more stablecoin reserves into U.S. Treasuries than China currently holds. While the committee stopped short of making direct comparisons, its analysis suggests that if projected growth materializes and legislation like the GENIUS Act is enacted, stablecoin demand could rival that of traditional sovereign creditors. The GENIUS Act, expected to pass in 2025, would regulate stablecoin issuers and link reserves ... More directly to short-term U.S. Treasuries. With the GENIUS Act expected this August, U.S. dollar stablecoin issuers like Tether and Circle will be required to hold reserves—including Treasuries—positioning them as major institutional buyers. That demand could surpass the $784 billion currently held by China, reshaping how the U.S. finances its debt. This isn’t just regulatory housekeeping—it’s strategic fiscal architecture. “The ultimate design and adoption of stablecoins will drive the magnitude of impact they have on U.S. Treasury demand,” the TBAC wrote in its meeting minutes. By designating T-bills with maturities under 93 days as eligible reserves, the proposed rules would position stablecoin issuers as key players at the front end of the curve. The GENIUS Act goes further, allowing those Treasuries to be used as repo collateral—making them even more attractive as backing for stablecoins. Japan and China—the top two foreign holders of U.S. Treasuries—currently hold $1.13 trillion and $784 billion, respectively. Combined, that’s still less than the projected $2 trillion market cap of stablecoins by 2028. If that projection holds, U.S. dollar stablecoins could soon rival or surpass traditional sovereign creditors. This isn’t just crypto—it’s a structural shift in how America funds itself, trading geopolitical reliance for market-based infrastructure powered by code and regulation. Stablecoin issuers are already acting like institutional buyers of U.S. Treasuries. Over $120 billion in short-term Treasuries back stablecoins today, with another $90 billion in money market funds. Unlike banks, which operate on fractional reserves, stablecoin issuers—under proposed U.S. rules—would hold full reserves, making them a steady, transparent source of Treasury demand. This shift has high-level backing. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has called stablecoins “a new channel of strategic demand,” saying they not only expand access to the dollar but also “support sustained demand for U.S. Treasury bills.” Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller has backed the role of stablecoins in extending U.S. dollar access globally—especially in high-inflation countries and regions with limited banking. “U.S. dollar stablecoins could be particularly appealing to those in high-inflation countries or to those without easy or affordable access to dollar cash or banking services,” Waller said. “I believe that stablecoins have the potential to maintain and extend the role of the dollar internationally.” According to a report by the venture firm a16z, stablecoins are crypto’s first “killer app.” In 2024, stablecoins facilitated $15.6 trillion in transfers—roughly equivalent to Visa’s annual volume. In March alone, stablecoin transactions hit a record $1.82 trillion, the report stated. While much of this is financial flows rather than retail payments, it highlights their rapid adoption in global finance. As trade tensions and tariff wars strain U.S.–China ties, Washington looks to stablecoins to reduce ... More its reliance on foreign creditors. As China steadily pulls back—its U.S. Treasury holdings dropping from $1.32 trillion in 2013 to $784 billion—Washington faces a question: who fills the gap? The TBAC suggests stablecoins might. With legislation expected by August, the U.S. could soon have a framework that turns stablecoins from crypto fringe into fiscal foundation. McKinsey estimates global bank deposits at $117 trillion; if less than 8% of this flows into dollar-backed stablecoins, it would exceed all foreign holdings of U.S. Treasuries. If current projections hold and regulation advances, the next major buyer of U.S. Treasuries may not be China or any foreign government—but a global network of dollar-backed stablecoins.

Title: Trump’s Bid to Transform International Relations May Succeed

We rely on your support for our independence, diversity and quality. Via Shutterstock. This article saved into your bookmarks. Click here to view your bookmarks. Since returning to office in January 2025, US President Donald Trump has aggressively pursued a radical reshaping of US foreign policy. In early March, the State Department terminated foreign assistance programs supporting political opposition and regime change in Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela, as it deemed them no longer in the US’s “national interest.” Trump also reversed the Biden administration’s agreement with Cuba, after it released 553 prisoners, to ease sanctions on the country. In February, the government issued an executive order to dissolve the Inter-American Foundation, an organization that had long promoted economic and community-led development in Latin America. The African Development Foundation is also slated to be eliminated under the executive order. And AFRICOM, the US military command for Africa, could be next. Trump’s sweeping cuts extend to global initiatives like the United States Institute of Peace (USIP), the US Agency for Global Media, the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars and US support for political prisoners worldwide. Facing a divided opposition, a largely compliant Grand Old Party (GOP) and key loyalists in power, Trump’s teardown of the foreign policy establishment is well underway. In place of the US-led multilateral order, he is embracing a blunt, America First, transactional approach to international affairs centered on military threats, economic coercion through tariffs and sanctions, and stricter immigration policies — stripped of the usual lip service to human rights. One of Trump’s first priorities has been a more aggressive crackdown on unauthorized migration. Weeks into his term, his administration began transferring undocumented immigrants to Guantanamo Bay. While migrant and advocacy groups challenged this action, in March a federal judge “expressed doubts toward those challenging the federal policy,” according to an article by The New York Times. Now, alleged Venezuelan gang members are being sent to El Salvador under a detention agreement with Trump ally El Salvador President Nayib Bukele. Panama, Costa Rica and Honduras have also agreed to accept third-party nationals, under the pressure of tariffs being imposed and other economic measures. Trump is also seeking greater control over strategic infrastructure abroad. In March, a consortium led by US firm Blackrock acquired both Panama Canal ports in a $19 billion deal, which underscores the role of the private sector in realizing his goals. Chinese state-run media criticized the Hong Kong-based seller and labeled the move as “economic coercion.” With Chinese entities removed from the canal, Trump has increasingly hinted at possible military action to secure even broader control over the Panama Canal. In his first term, Trump floated the idea of sending private military companies to Venezuela to topple Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, a tactic that could resurface. Tensions with NATO allies have played out publicly. This has undermined the transatlantic alliance crucial to the US-led global order, with Trump wielding tariffs and even threats of annexation to pressure partners. Trump is also using US aid as leverage to highlight the dependence of partner countries, like shutting off intelligence-sharing and military aid to Ukraine, one of the several pressure tactics used to push Kyiv toward peace talks with Russia. In turn, Senior Advisor to Donald Trump Elon Musk briefly hinted at disabling Starlink services in Ukraine, which are vital for the country’s military communications, before walking back his comments. This pattern of signaling intent is common among Trump allies — before the March 14 executive order was issued to force Voice of America to shut down, Musk publicly called for its closure in February. To continue with his overhaul, Trump must dismantle much of the entrenched civil service and foreign policy bureaucracy, which he struggled with during his first term. Career officials, including some Republicans like John McCain, resisted his agenda through leaks, delays and policy changes. Their efforts were complemented by the GOP’s disdain for the civil service, which has shifted increasingly left in recent decades. In the final months of his first term, Trump issued Schedule F, an executive order that reclassified certain career positions as political appointments, thereby making them easier to dismiss. US President Joe Biden rescinded this order when he took office in January 2021. Dismantling a decades-old political apparatus is no simple feat. Since World War II, Washington has built a vast ecosystem of non-governmental organizations, think tanks and development agencies that shape US foreign policy and diplomacy. Even after the September 11 terror attacks, as President George W. Bush leaned heavily on hard power with the launch of the Global War on Terror, his administration also introduced initiatives like the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, the Millennium Challenge Corporation and the President’s Malaria Initiative, to maintain international goodwill while waging unpopular wars. These programs, alongside organizations like the Peace Corps, the US Trade and Development Agency and others mentioned previously, were all repurposed by various administrations, awarded lucrative contracts and had close ties to policymakers. Over time, a revolving door of agencies, contractors and policymakers has reinforced and expanded this system, consolidating funding and influence. Until 2006, USAID’s website openly stated, “The principal beneficiary of America’s foreign assistance programs has always been the United States,” with nearly 80% of USAID contracts and grants flowing to US firms. By 2018, of the $48 billion in official development assistance (ODA), 21% went to governments, 20% to nonprofit organizations, 34% to multilateral organizations and 25% elsewhere. Despite reaching nearly $80 billion in 2023 under the Biden administration, ODA still accounted for just 1.17% of the federal budget. Trump’s efforts to undermine ODA may not just be limited to cutting its spending but also extend to dismantling the core institutions that have driven American foreign policy for decades. Now, in his second term, his purge of the civil service is far more aggressive. After labeling institutions like USIP and the Inter-American Foundation as politicized and aligned with Democratic priorities, Trump has made it harder for Democrats to justify billions of dollars for projects abroad — especially given longstanding concerns over ODA’s efficiency. In 2015, the acting deputy inspector general flagged USAID’s “chronic, systemic weaknesses,” citing poor oversight, weak risk management and human capital issues. By 2017, as Trump intensified scrutiny, the Carnegie Endowment reported that USAID “lacked programmatic focus” and found both the State Department and USAID were overstretched, with little evaluation of their effectiveness. Aid often went to corrupt governments, was too small to make an impact and failed to give Washington meaningful leverage. USIP, originally designed for conflict resolution when introduced in 1984, has increasingly been viewed by critics as a vehicle for nation-building. Similarly, AFRICOM, established in 2007 to promote US national security interests in Africa, has turned its focus toward counterterrorism, with limited results. Aid recipients also face restrictions, often required to purchase goods and services from donor countries like the US. Other areas of ODA, such as global media outreach, promote a more traditional approach favored by Democrats and established foreign policy experts, have also lost their strategic edge as rival powers have undercut their effectiveness. US-backed media outlets like Voice of America, Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty have seen their influence wane amid competition from alternative international networks like Al Jazeera, RT and China’s state-run media. These competitors have reshaped the global information sphere, while decentralized information and social media platforms have proven more effective at reaching audiences. Meanwhile, China’s Belt and Road Initiative has demonstrated the effectiveness of direct infrastructure development investment, offering countries tangible benefits in exchange for strategic concessions, such as port access for Chinese ships. Russia and Israel, in contrast, have shown how unilateral military force can be used to advance foreign policy objectives. Trump views America’s lingering military and economic dominance as key tools for reasserting US power in a changing global order. His more aggressive military stance and mercantilist economic approach prioritize coercion over multilateralism, seeking immediate and concrete gains in the national interest. While previous administrations invested in steady economic and diplomatic maneuvering, Trump’s strategy emphasizes swift tariffs, threats and direct pressure to drive markets and provoke immediate reactions. This approach is unpalatable to the ingrained culture of the current foreign policy bureaucracy. If successful in reshaping American foreign policy, Trump will force a departure from Washington’s historical promotion of free trade. Former US presidents like Bill Clinton, Bush and Barack Obama all reduced tariffs. While Biden eased some with the European Union, he raised them on China. Trump’s global tariff increases and trade wars will have far-reaching implications; it could signal the potential end of the US as a faithful consumer market, challenge the dollar’s status as the world’s reserve currency and question its commitment to protecting global sea lanes. American democracy promotion, which is never a consistent priority, is now without even rhetorical commitment. While the US has long backed autocrats, Trump’s acceptance of strongman rule extends to adversaries. His recent characterization of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as a dictator while avoiding such language for Russian President Vladimir Putin shows a deliberate loosening of ideological constraints. Additionally, the US has long been averse to international law, refusing to ratify the International Criminal Court and the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. Yet, it has traditionally played a central role in upholding basic global legal frameworks, with Europe often supporting its efforts. Now shunning Europe, Washington’s acceptance of border changes by Russia and Israel signals a growing respect for force, whether from allies or adversaries. China, Iran and others are taking note. They may soon strongly mirror the US’s use of economic and political pressure, reducing the autonomy of smaller countries. Trump’s ongoing dismantling of the foreign policy establishment does not indicate an American retreat from global affairs, but a radical overhaul. Washington is shedding the post-World War II and post-Cold War neoliberal order it created, characterized by multilateralism, in favor of a more confrontational, transactional approach based on unilateral strength. The erosion of institutions is another mark of the end of America’s “unipolar moment” and a return to a more volatile and unpredictable era of global affairs.

Title: Ben Powell on Market Volatility: Riding the global investment seesaw

BlackRock Investment Institute's APAC Investment Strategist Ben Powell in an interview to ET Now acknowledged market volatility and emphasized that investors must adapt to this new reality. He advised staying calm, avoiding overreaction to short-term movements, and instead focusing on long-term structural shifts to guide investment decisions. Despite ongoing global concerns, market sentiment has recently turned more positive. One of the key contributors has been the continued strength of the AI sector, which is driving growth particularly in the US. India is also benefiting from favorable developments, such as falling oil prices and a more balanced geopolitical position. Notably, the S&P 500 has achieved a nine-day winning streak — a milestone not seen since 2004 — reflecting the strength of current market momentum. Ben Powell attributed the current equity rally to strong earnings, especially from major tech companies. These firms have consistently outperformed expectations, fueled by the ongoing AI boom. Despite widespread concerns, the hard data — particularly earnings reports — has shown resilience. This earnings strength is now the core reason behind the market's recent upswing, rather than sentiment alone. Powell stressed that the global equity landscape has changed dramatically over the past decade. Today, investors need to be more selective and nuanced, especially when considering emerging markets. These markets are not uniform, and in a world increasingly fractured by geopolitical and economic divisions, picking the right markets is essential. Both the US and India stand out as strong contenders in this environment. India is emerging as a key beneficiary of current global shifts. The country stands to gain from the recent decline in oil prices, which supports its macroeconomic stability. Additionally, India’s unique geopolitical stance allows it to negotiate favorable trade arrangements with multiple partners. The Reserve Bank of India may also find more flexibility in its monetary policy, further strengthening the country's economic outlook. Despite recent market gains, risks remain. Powell pointed out that the US economy is still expected to face a contraction, partly due to unresolved trade tensions and potential new tariffs from the US administration. Structural challenges such as labor market disruptions and supply chain issues are also likely to affect corporate earnings and broader economic stability in the coming quarters. Acknowledging the unpredictable nature of the current environment, Powell urged investors to accept that we are no longer in the era of stability seen a decade ago. With rising uncertainty driven by AI, geopolitics, and trade conflicts, the key is to stay grounded and focus on the fundamentals. Even though the headwinds are real, Powell believes the tailwinds — particularly from AI — are powerful enough to keep certain sectors moving forward. Markets are being buoyed by strong corporate earnings, especially in the tech sector, and by transformative forces like artificial intelligence. India continues to benefit from global rebalancing and macroeconomic tailwinds. However, challenges such as an expected slowdown in the US economy and unresolved trade issues remain. In this complex environment, Powell advises sticking to long-term investment principles and recognizing where sustainable growth is likely to emerge.

Title: The Degen Banker: When Wall Street Meets Crypto Twitter (Nkahiseng Ralepeli)

Time Published: 2025-05-05T06:56:09Z
Full Content:
Once upon a time, calling yourself a “degen” was financial heresy. It meant you YOLO’d into dog coins, aped into DeFi yield farms with 6,000% APRs, and spent more time in Discord than on Bloomberg. You were a creature of chaos, allergic to compliance decks and powered by memes and Metamask. But times have changed. Today, the degen banker is no longer a contradiction in terms. It’s a job description. It’s also a symptom of something far more seismic: the full-on convergence between crypto-native innovation and institutional finance. And if you’re still under the impression that institutions are sitting this one out, let me offer you a very different reality—one backed by numbers, balance sheets, and, yes, some very large suits chasing digital alpha. From Edge to Centre: Institutional Inflows Are Here Crypto may have been born in rebellion, but it’s growing up in a three-piece suit. In 2024 alone, over $10 billion in institutional capital flowed into digital asset products globally, with Bitcoin ETFs accounting for nearly $5 billion of that figure in just the first quarter of their U.S. launch. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) alone crossed $15 billion in AUM within five months of going live. That’s not degen retail—those are RIAs, wealth managers, and pension funds, slowly but surely embracing exposure. And it’s not just ETFs. 47% of hedge funds now have digital asset exposure, up from just 33% in 2022, according to PwC’s latest global crypto hedge fund report. Meanwhile, tokenized U.S. Treasuries—yes, on-chain government bonds—grew by over 450% in the past year, surpassing $1.5 billion in market cap, with players like Franklin Templeton and BlackRock issuing tokenized bonds on public and permissioned blockchains. Tokenized treasuries have now surpassed the $5 billion mark. What’s more, Bank of America, Citi, JPMorgan, HSBC, and Standard Chartered now all have live pilots or products in tokenization, custody, or blockchain-based payments. No longer science experiments, these projects are tied to core infrastructure upgrades and new commercial models. In 2023, JPMorgan’s Onyx processed over $900 billion in value using blockchain for repo transactions. That’s not weekend degen liquidity; that’s wholesale capital markets saying, “We’ll have what DeFi’s having—but with compliance, please.” Why Institutions Are Frothing to Play Let’s not kid ourselves—institutions aren’t here because they suddenly developed a soft spot for decentralisation. They’re here because: So yes, the gold rush is real. But this time, it's not prospectors with pickaxes—it's institutions with policy teams and quarterly earnings calls. The Great Cultural Merge The cultural tension here is delicious. Imagine a DeFi protocol engineer explaining LP mechanics to a middle-office credit team. Or a banker asking a DAO treasurer how to assess counterparty risk when the counterparty is pseudonymous. But it’s happening. Slowly, messily, and with a lot of mutual mistrust—but it’s happening. This cultural merge is forcing both sides to evolve: And for all the friction, the convergence is producing real-world innovation: programmable bonds, on-chain invoices, stablecoin-based treasury products, and more. So, What’s a Degen Banker, Really? A degen banker isn’t just a meme or an oxymoron. It’s a recognition that the future of finance is hybrid. It’s someone who understands that slippage and spreads matter just as much as smart contract audits. That compliance isn’t a blocker—it’s a moat. That building trustless infrastructure doesn’t mean we abandon trust; it means we rebuild it on different rails. And let’s be honest: the degen bankers are winning. Because while crypto’s early believers were often dismissed as naïve gamblers, it turns out we were early to a fundamental truth: money is information, and the next generation of financial infrastructure would be digital, open, and programmable. Today, institutions are just catching up. Final Word We are no longer in a world of “either/or.” We are living the “both/and.” You can trade options and still mint NFTs. You can issue a bond and wrap it on Ethereum. You can quote LIBOR and know what MEV is. That’s the world we’re heading into. The only question is: are you still watching from the sidelines? Or are you ready to go full degen—in a tie?

Title: The Irish passport at 100: Not just a travel document but a declaration of hope and of reclaiming identity

Weeks after Terence Reynolds, originally from Cloncowley, Drumlish, Co Longford, died at his home in Yonkers in New York, his daughter Christina found an old suitcase in the attic. “[It had] a single identifying label in cream tape with a handwritten writing stating CLONCOWLEY,” she wrote in reply to a request from the Department for Foreign Affairs for stories about Irish passports. The story of Terence Reynolds is one of scores told in an exhibition on the history of the now 100-years-old passport at Epic, the Irish emigration museum on Custom House Quay in Dublin. Throughout, it has not just been a travel document, but often a declaration of hope in a better future for those who left Ireland’s shores, or a reclaiming of identity by many of those in the Irish diaspora today. The suitcase was the one Terence Reynolds, a carpenter, had carried from his Cloncowley home: “Inside, I found what I believe was my dad’s very first Irish passport. It was in pristine condition, frozen in time.” His photograph was one she had never seen before, revealing “a very young, fresh-faced” man “full of hope, ambition, and the quiet determination that would carry him across the Atlantic”. “I sat there imagining this young 20-year-old in 1968 getting on a plane for the first time and landing in 1960s New York, taking up abode in Inwood,” his daughter writes. The contribution by Christina Reynolds illustrates one of the key themes of the On The Move exhibition, says Epic’s historian, Catherine Healy: “We really wanted to tap into the emotions around passports.” The first Irish passports were used by WT Cosgrave, Desmond Fitzgerald and the delegation that went to Geneva in 1923 to take up the Irish Free State’s League of Nations place “to resounding applause”. The public began to apply for the passports from April 1924, although significant tensions emerged between Dublin and London over the terminology to be used. Writing from London, Fitzgerald, the minister for external relations, told the department’s top official, Joseph P Walshe, of a meeting with “a most objectionable” Foreign Office official. The British were insistent that the term “British subject” be used, arguing that any other language breached the Anglo-Irish Treaty and would “cause endless trouble and confusion”. Regarding the Irish passport as “a branch” of the British one, the British side, the records show, “didn’t want Irishmen going around over in the US saying that they’re not British subjects”. The British arguments were a nonsense, Fitzgerald told them, since “the term ‘British subject’ included everyone from (prime minister Stanley) Baldwin to an undiscovered savage in British Guiana”. In the end, an uneasy compromise was reached: “Ultimately, bearers were described as a ‘citizen of the Irish Free State, one of the British Commonwealth of Nations’,” says Healy. The early troubles did not end there because British consular officials sometimes refused to recognise the passport or doctored it if it was handed in to them, writing “British subject” in, she says. The first passport, well finished with a hard cover, cost 1 shilling. For most in the 1920s and 1930s, and later, it was not a declaration of pride but an exit document required for emigration. Now available usually within days, for decades passports took longer to get. “Passport officials were handwriting documents right up until the 1990s,” says Healy. Security has tightened, too. A cabinet illuminated by ultraviolet light highlights just some of the security features of today’s passports, including Celtic imagery invisible to the naked eye. The latest electronic passports now display the holders’ biometric image three times – as a photograph, a laser imprint and a hologram. Tougher security was prompted from the late 1980s following a series of incidents, including the conviction of an Irish official in 1989 who sold passports to North African buyers. In 2010, Micheál Martin, then the Minister for Foreign Affairs, ordered an Israeli diplomat to leave Ireland after Israel’s intelligence agency, Mossad, used Irish passports in the Dubai killing of a leading Hamas figure. [ From the archive: Fake passports? They're part of a very long storyOpens in new window ] The exhibition tells the stories of the famous, and those not so famous. Poet, WB Yeats – by then a senator – travelled on Irish, not British documents, to receive the Nobel Prize for Literature in Stockholm in December 1923. Not every artist thought the same way, however. James Joyce, who lived in Paris in the 1920s and 1930s , never applied for one: “That surprised me,” says Healy. However, he did seek one during the second World War for his daughter, Lucia, who he tried to move to Switzerland from the Parisian mental asylum where she was staying. “German officials were already aware that she had British papers and said that it wouldn’t be possible. She remained (in Paris) until 1951,” says the Epic historian. Joyce never explained his attitude. “It could have been purely pragmatic,” she says, “or possibly resentment against the Free State, which he saw as quite suffocating. “In one of his letters to his son, he says he was advised to get an Irish passport, and he declined and got a British replacement instead. So, he consciously chose not to do so.” For others, however, an Irish passport has been hugely important. Take Abigail O’Reilly, two of whose grandparents, Bill Phillips and his wife, Jean, left Cabra and Fairview respectively for 1960s England. “They were part of the ‘forgotten generation’,” says O’Reilly, telling of how her grandparents “ended up working together on the buses where he was the driver and she the conductor”. During a break in Covid restrictions, O’Reilly moved to Dublin in 2020 for college. “My grandfather and I have forged a really special bond. He has started opening up to me about his childhood,” she says. Suffering from dementia, his childhood memories are now uppermost in his mind; cycling through Moore Street with friends, knowing Brendan Behan. “Ireland now seems to hold a much more romantic and nostalgic place in his mind,” says O’Reilly. A year ago, she received her own Irish passport. “I feel incredibly lucky and proud to have been able to return to a country which my grandparents were not able to remain in. I feel all the more connected to them,” she says. The exhibition also tells of the secrets of the past, including of the adoption of thousands of Irish children who were sent abroad on Irish passports until the 1970s, “With their birth name in the document”, says Healy. She tells the story of Brian Burke, who was born in Dublin to a single mother and spent his first year in St Patrick’s Infant Hospital in Blackrock. “He was adopted by an American couple in the US in the 1950s, even though legislation at the time didn’t allow overseas adoptions. In his photo, he’s just over a year-and-a-half old,” she says. Once adopted, his name was changed to Daniel Doherty. Before his mother died, his adoptive mother shared with him his carefully kept adoption records. Embarking on his journey to discover his Irish heritage, he requested in 2021, when he renewed his passport seven decades later, that both of his names would appear. And now they do. A year later, he returned to Ireland, learning of “an amazing family history”. “I am blessed and thankful for the life I was given and the path I was set on so long ago,” he said. “I am proud to be from Ireland and I value my Irish citizenship. It has been an amazing journey that started 70 years ago with a little green Irish passport.” © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Arizona Governor Shoots Down Plans for State Bitcoin Reserve
URL: https://www.pymnts.com/cryptocurrency/2025/arizona-governor-shoots-down-plans-for-state-bitcoin-reserve/
Time Published: 2025-05-04T23:23:24Z

Arizona’s governor has vetoed legislation that would have let the state invest in cryptocurrency. “The Arizona State Retirement System is one of the strongest in the nation because it makes sound and informed investments,” Gov. Katie Hobbs wrote Friday (May 2) in a letter to state Sen. Warren Petersen, president of the state Senate. “Arizonans’ retirement funds are not the place for the state to try untested investments like virtual currencу.” State lawmakers last week approved legislation that would have established a bitcoin reserve, allowing the state to invest as much as 10% of its public funds in digital assets. Republican state Sen. Wendy Rogers told NBC News last week that it was in Hobbs’ best interest to sign the legislation, which would have created the first state-level bitcoin reserve in the country. “Crypto and bitcoin have a huge following nationwide and in Arizona. They are wildly popular with the youth and independents,” Rogers said, adding, “I certainly hope she signs it, because she can take credit and it will make her look good.” She voiced her disappointment with Hobbs on X following the governor’s decision on Friday, writing: “Politicians don’t understand that Bitcoin doesn’t need Arizona. Arizona needs Bitcoin.” The efforts by state lawmakers to establish an Arizona bitcoin reserve mirror plans by President Donald Trump to create a similar reserve on a national level. And as PYMNTS wrote last week, it’s also a sign of the growing mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies. “Observers believe it is becoming increasingly held, across Wall Street and beyond, that digital assets may no longer be confined to speculative circles. As bitcoin ETFs become a growing component of diversified portfolios and regulatory frameworks begin to crystallize, the decentralization dream that once defined crypto appears to be giving way to a new era of structured integration. “It’s no longer a novelty to see major investment firms exploring crypto, but this year has seen a turning point. Morgan Stanley is preparing to offer cryptocurrency trading to its vast E*Trade customer base as soon as next year, with the potential to introduce millions of retail investors to digital assets via a familiar platform. “Meanwhile, Charles Schwab is preparing to offer spot crypto trading for bitcoin and ethereum within the year, with the goal of meeting increasing demand from traditional investors. “These moves are not isolated,” the report added. “BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, is pushing blockchain technology deeper into conventional finance. The firm recently announced plans to register a new share class of its $150 billion money market fund on a blockchain, a step designed to enhance transparency and operational efficiency.” Arizona Governor Shoots Down Plans for State Bitcoin Reserve Trump's 'Warm Spot' for TikTok Could Extend Ban Deadline Again Airbnb: 50% of Users Turn to AI Bot for Customer Service Wendy's Predicts Diners Will Feel Pressured All Year We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

Title: Why the Panama Canal is a big, long-term prize in Trump's global trade war

BREAKING: Canadian PM Mark Carney tells Trump his country is 'not for sale' Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time The Panama Canal has spent the past few years battling extreme weather, with the El Niño phenomenon and severe drought leading to a water-level crisis. Now, it’s President Trump’s trade war that is threatening the global trade gateway. A critical passage for U.S. East Coast bound ocean freight container traffic, the Panama Canal is facing a potential business slump as a result of Trump’s China tariffs and a rapid decline in manufactured goods being ordered by U.S. shippers. Forty percent of all U.S. container traffic travels through the Panama Canal every year, and in all, $270 billion in cargo annually. The U.S. and China are the top users of the Panama Canal, and its role in global shipping has increased in recent years due to the disruption of global supply chains. The Panama Canal Authority’s revenue hit $3.38 billion last year, despite drought conditions, and revenue has increased every year since 2017. The trade war uncertainty and Trump’s 145% tariff on Chinese goods — which will start to hit goods arriving from China to U.S. ports on May 27 based on the four to six weeks it takes for ocean freight to reach the U.S. from Asia — has already resulted in a massive pause on U.S. imports bound from China. According to data from supply chain intelligence firm Project44, there has been a 300% increase in blank sailings (cancelled freight vessels) from China to the United States since Trump’s so-called “Liberation Day” tariffs announcement on April 2. West Coast ports in the U.S. are already being hit and the impact on East Coast ports is expected to increase, with the pullback in vessels a result of the decrease in manufacturing orders for Chinese factories: less products manufactured translates into less shipping containers for ocean carriers. For the Asia to North America East Coast trade route, Sea-Intelligence has recorded a cumulative blanked capacity of 261,822 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs.) over the last six weeks. This decrease in containers and vessels can impact Panama Canal revenue. The Panama Canal makes its money off of the number of vessel transits and containers moving through the waterway. ″Since close to 75% of our cargo goes to or from the United States, any recession worldwide or in the United States will impact somehow the Panama Canal,” said Boris Moreno, vice president of operations for the Panama Canal Authority. “That’s for sure.″ One of the “Seven Wonders of the Modern World,” according to the American Society of Civil Engineers, the canal has been a lightning rod for controversy in recent years in the battle for global supremacy between the U.S. and China. Trump has claimed the canal’s key ports are being controlled by China and has threatened to reassert U.S. control over the canal, accusing Panama of charging excessive rates. China, along with government of Panama, have denied those claims. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth both visited with Panamanian government officials in recent months. ″I think that Panama over the last five years has inched closer and closer to China and away from the United States,” Federal Maritime Commissioner Louis Sola said in an interview with CNBC earlier this year. “I’ve seen China and Brazil take away $20 billion with direct contracts. We definitely need to at least have a game there.” Ricaurte Vasquez, administrator for the Panama Canal Authority, tells CNBC that with the U.S. being the world’s largest economy, it is reviewing Trump’s concerns. “Whatever is said in Washington has repercussions all over,” said Vasquez. “We try to stay cool, calm and collected.” He added, “It is not true that we are run by Chinese. It is not true that we differentiate rates. It is not true that 38,000 people die in the construction of the Panama Canal. Everyone that wants to sail sails through the Panama Canal. And we are open to the world. That is the neutrality treaty. We have to remain open.” In March, an investment group led by U.S. firm BlackRock announced it was trying to purchase two ports at either end of the canal, as well as about 40 others from Hong Kong based-CK Hutchison. The outcome of that deal remains unclear. © 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC

Title: Why Private Equity Is Betting On Tokenization

ByAzeem Khan ByAzeem Khan, Contributor. Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Web3 and Digital Assets ByAzeem Khan, Contributor. Over the past decade, private equity became one of the most influential forces in global markets. With interest rates near zero and capital flowing freely, firms like Blackstone, KKR, and Apollo went on an unprecedented buying spree. They acquired everything from single-family homes to hospitals, software companies, and telecom infrastructure. Between 2012 and 2022, global private equity assets under management more than tripled, reaching over $13.4 trillion. That wave of acquisition concentrated enormous value into illiquid and closely held assets. It also created the kind of structural bottleneck that tokenization may now be uniquely positioned to help resolve. But in 2025, the environment looks very different. With Donald Trump back in office, inflation proving difficult to contain, and the Federal Reserve holding rates higher for longer, liquidity is harder to manufacture. IPO windows remain limited, secondary transactions continue to trade at steep discounts, and traditional exits are slow or nonexistent. The era when private equity firms could simply sell portfolio companies to one another, often at inflated valuations, has quietly ended. Tokenization is no longer just a concept being floated at panels. It is becoming one of the few tools large capital allocators are seriously exploring to create flexibility in portfolios that were never designed to stay illiquid this long. Low interest rates are unlikely to return anytime soon. Markets have largely accepted that the Federal Reserve will move cautiously, with traders pricing in fewer than three rate cuts through the end of 2025. Longer-term yields remain elevated, and the days of abundant, cheap capital are over. That capital fueled a decade of leveraged growth in private markets. What remains is a backlog of assets that need new liquidity rails to move. That backdrop makes the push toward tokenization more strategic than revolutionary. With traditional exits constricted and public markets still tentative, financial institutions are actively searching for alternatives. Tokenization has emerged as one. By wrapping illiquid assets such as private equity, real estate, or infrastructure stakes into blockchain-based instruments, firms can fractionalize ownership, enable 24/7 trading, and expand access to a broader pool of global investors. This is not just about efficiency. It is about building new distribution infrastructure for assets that no longer have clear paths to exit. Major financial institutions are already moving in this direction. BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, has filed with the SEC to tokenize shares of its $150 billion Treasury Trust Fund, creating a new class of digital shares recorded on a blockchain ledger. Franklin Templeton has launched the Franklin OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund, a fully tokenized fund that allows investors to gain exposure through digital tokens. Hamilton Lane has partnered with platforms like Securitize and Republic to offer tokenized versions of its private equity funds in an effort to broaden access to retail investors. For retail investors, this shift presents both opportunity and risk. On one hand, tokenization could finally provide access to asset classes that were once reserved for pension funds and billion-dollar LPs, such as private equity, real estate, and credit. Fractional ownership and 24/7 trading might lower the barriers to entry. On the other hand, the assets being tokenized are often the hardest to value and the least liquid for a reason. Institutions are not turning to blockchain out of altruism. They are using it to create new distribution channels to retail capital for assets they cannot easily offload elsewhere. Without proper regulation, disclosures, and investor protections, tokenization may become a way to transfer illiquidity risk under the appearance of innovation. That does not mean tokenization is inherently flawed. It may still unlock access and improve capital formation in meaningful ways. But it is critical to understand what is motivating the shift. If we focus only on the technology and ignore the incentives behind it, we risk mistaking distribution for disruption and missing the real forces reshaping capital markets. Tokenization is often framed as the next frontier of financial innovation. And it is. But it is also something more urgent and less romantic: a pressure valve. As trillions in private capital search for liquidity in a world where traditional exits no longer work, blockchain infrastructure is quietly becoming the system of last resort. Whether driven by strategy or necessity, this shift is already underway. The financial architecture of the next decade will not be defined solely by regulation or ideology. It will be shaped by who needs liquidity and how quickly they can create new ways to unlock it.

Title: Best Crypto to Buy as Solana Shows Technical Strength amid ETF Buzz

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Solana is ready to pump thanks to strong technical indicators and ecosystem support. The ‘cup’ started forming around November 2022, with the handle emerging during the tariff-induced panic sell-off. Even more encouraging is that this pattern hasn’t popped overnight – it’s taken 2.5 years to form, which makes it a stronger bullish indication. $SOL has risen around 38% since the second week of April, showing good upward momentum. Read on for more reasons investors are bullish on $SOL. We’ll also point you towards the best crypto to buy to benefit from the upcoming bull run. There has also been an increasing push towards stock tokenization on the Solana blockchain. The Solana Policy Institute has submitted a proposal called ‘Project Open’ to the SEC, which will issue tradable tokens for stocks. This would make transactions faster, and billions of dollars stuck in settlement delays can be pumped back into the markets almost instantly, generating more wealth over time. Every stock, every bond, every fund—every asset—can be tokenized. If they are, it will revolutionize investing. – Larry Fink More good news: a Solana exchange-traded fund also looks like a certainty in the near future. Bloomberg has predicted a 90% chance for $SOL ETF approval in 2025 itself. Furthermore, the Solana stablecoin supply is also at an all-time high. It reached $11.7B in February 2025 and further shot up to $13B by May. Note that it was just $5B last year. A hike like this should open up new possibilities in the Web3 and DeFi space. All in all, if you want to ride Solana’s growth, this is the best time to invest. The cryptos mentioned in this guide, especially Solaxy, offer the highest potential for returns. Even though Solana has many positives potentially propelling it to new highs, it’d be difficult for the network to realize its full potential until it can overcome its congestion and scalability issues. Enter Solaxy ($SOLX). Solaxy is a new cryptocurrency and one of the very few offering real-world application. After all, it plans to build the very first Layer 2 scaling protocol on Solana. This Solana L2 will offload some transactions onto a sidechain, which is how it’ll reduce the burden on Solana’s mainnet and speed up the entire blockchain. Additionally, $SOLX will also reduce the transaction fees on Solana by processing a lot of transactions simultaneously, instead of one by one. Currently, however, one $SOLX will only cost you $0.001714. That’s because the token is in presale, where it has raised a staggering $33M. If this is your first crypto presale purchase, check out our guide on how to buy Solaxy. With over $1.5B in market capitalization, Bonk ($BONK) is easily the biggest dog-themed meme coin on Solana. It was also the first-ever dog coin on the network. In case you have any reservations about the potential of dog cryptos, just look at the most successful meme coins of all time. Three out of the top five, i.e., $DOGE, $SHIB, and $BONK, are inspired by ‘man’s best friend.’ What’s more, one of the biggest success stories of recent times, $BROCCOLI, is also a dog-themed coin. Coming to $BONK, its chart suggests that it’s now taking support at the $0.000016 level, which happens to be a previous resistance zone. The crypto is already up over 50% in the last month and can rally further once $SOL takes off. Thanks to a low price of $0.0000161p, $BONK is in contention for the best cheap cryptos to buy now. Created on a suggestion by the Truth Terminal AI chatbot, Fartcoin ($FARTCOIN) is one of the most amusing community-driven cryptos on the market. It rewards token holders if they submit hilarious fart jokes. Moreover, there’s an uncanny ‘Gas Fee’ mechanism that emits a fart sound every time a transaction goes through. Quite naturally, crypto degens were quick to send $FARTCOIN soaring; it’s, in fact, one of the best meme coins on the market. The token has jumped over 145% in just the last month or so, and it’s expected to continue its climb with much velocity once it breaks through the $1.20 resistance level. You can buy it now for just $1.09. $SOL’s upcoming upward momentum can indeed drag the best altcoins on its network along with it. However, even though the signs are all there, there’s really no guaranteeing anything in crypto. The market is volatile and full of ups and downs, which is why it’s recommended you DYOR and only invest an amount that’s small enough for you.

Title: Michael Saylor’s $84 Billion Bitcoin Bet: How Is Strategy Doing On Its Current BTC Holdings?

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin-first investment strategy has once again taken the spotlight after Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) laid out an ambitious new plan to scale its BTC holdings. The company now owns over half a million bitcoins, making it one of the biggest institutional players in the crypto market. However, the company isn’t done yet, as recent filings shows an ambitious $84 billion plan to acquire more Bitcoins. As the Bitcoin price hovers around $97,000 in early May, the scale of Strategy’s Bitcoin plan is important, not only for its size but also for the significant role it now plays in the company’s trajectory. During its latest earnings call, Strategy introduced what it calls the 42/42 Plan, which is a roadmap aimed at raising $84 billion in capital over the next two years. The funding will be split equally between equity and fixed-income instruments, all designated to be used for further Bitcoin acquisitions. This initiative follows a $21 billion at-the-market equity offering that recently brought in over 301,000 BTC in recent months, sending the company’s share price soaring by 50%. As of April 28, 2025, Strategy holds 553,555 BTC, acquired at a total cost of $37.9 billion and an average price of $68,459 per coin. Of this total, 107,155 BTC have been bought in 2025 alone, making it the company’s most aggressive buying year to date despite only four months having passed. The firm’s internal disclosures also note an average cost of $66,384.56 per bitcoin. The latest acquisition round included 15,355 BTC purchased at an average price of $92,737 on April 28 at $1.42 billion. These aggressive purchases have positioned Strategy as the world’s second-largest institutional holder of Bitcoin, just behind BlackRock. Interestingly, Strategy’s playbook for building a BTC-heavy balance sheet is not slowing down. Even as the company reported its fifth consecutive quarterly net loss, investor sentiment is still optimistic. The company reported an unrealized $5.9 billion loss in the first quarter of 2025. However, its stock is up by approximately 32% since the beginning of the year and has outperformed the Nasdaq 100 index, which is down nearly 6% over the same period. Strategy’s market value is now deeply influenced by Bitcoin’s price direction. The company’s BTC portfolio has yielded a 13.7% return so far in 2025, generating a paper gain of $5.8 billion. Despite the crypto market volatility, the company updated its BTC yield target from 15% to 25% and a $15 billion profit goal by the end of the year. At the time of writing, Strategy’s Bitcoin strategy continues to pay well, and the company’s stock has been rising in tandem with Bitcoin’s recent rally. MSTR is currently up by 3.35% in the past 24 hours and is currently trading at $394.37. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is trading at $96,500.

Title: Costco, Levi's, and Other Companies Stubbornly Cling to DEI Policies
URL: https://www.breitbart.com/economy/2025/05/03/costco-levis-other-companies-stubbornly-cling-dei-policies/

While the populist consensus is that MAGA is killing off diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) in corporate America, that may not always be the case in some of the nation’s biggest companies. According to one report, shareholders of some leading companies, including Costco, Apple, Levi’s, John Deere, Goldman Sachs, and others, have voted against proposals targeting DEI programs. Those proposals included asking companies to ditch their DEI policies and examine the legal risks of pursuing them. Two conservative think tanks, the National Center for Public Policy Research and the National Legal and Policy Center, are reportedly behind most of the DEI-killing measures. In January, Breitbart News noted that Costco had dug in its heels after a shareholder proposal urged the “wholesale club operator to conduct an evaluation of any business risk posed by its” DEI practices, according to AP. “‘But Costco’s board of directors voted unanimously to ask shareholders to reject the motion,’ an AP report stated, noting their message to shareholders claimed that having a diverse workforce and suppliers resulted in greater customer satisfaction.” DEI in the workplace results in employee training, resource networks, and recruiting practices that advance representation of different races, genders, and classes, people with disabilities, veterans, and other groups. But opponents like Elon Musk, the Tesla and X CEO, and President Donald Trump himself, say DEI is unfair to qualified workers and represents “reverse racism.” Dozens of companies, including Target and Meta, have dialed back or eliminated their diversity programs in recent months under pressure from the Trump administration. Opponents sometimes cite that DEI violates the spirit of a 2023 U.S. Supreme Court decision that stated racial preferences in college admissions violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution. But as Breitbart reported at the time, that decision only applies to state governments and institutions. Shareholder votes are where DEI opponents are losing, reported CNN Business. The rejections of anti-DEI proposals “reveal that the investor community doesn’t think that having a tough stance on DEI makes financial sense,” Matteo Gatti, a professor of law at Rutgers University who studies corporate governance, told the network. “Investors are saying they don’t want ideological shareholders to drive business.” That “community,” however, appears to be dominated by Wall Street’s big players. “Large institutional investors” apparently call the shots at many multinational corporations. Mega investors “such as BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street are the top shareholders of most companies. “They typically oppose outside shareholder resolutions,” the network reported, “siding with company management in around 90% of the votes.” Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.

Title: Rhode Island-Based Brown University Joins Bitcoin Rush, Reporting $5 Million Investment In BlackRock’s BTC ETF

Rhode-based Ivy League Institution Brown University disclosed in a recent regulatory filing that it is holding exposure to Bitcoin via BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) shares. This marks the first time the academic institution has sought exposure to the world’s oldest and largest cryptocurrency. Add Brown University to the list of institutional investors taking a shine to Bitcoin. A new 13F-HR filing with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission shows the university owned 105,000 shares of IBIT, worth roughly $4.9 million, as of March 31. The IBIT shares were not listed in the previous quarter’s filing. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, is credited with rekindling the spot BTC ETF movement, after the SEC time and again rejected such products since 2013. These novel investment products give traditional investors access to Bitcoin without the hassle of buying and storing it themselves. Pundits believe the introduction of Bitcoin ETFs marks one of the most successful financial product launches in history. Notably, IBIT is currently the biggest spot Bitcoin ETF, with a staggering $57 billion in assets under management. It’s worth mentioning that Brown is not the first university to have exposure to Bitcoin. The University of Austin (UATX) partnered with Bitcoin services company Unchained in May 2024 to launch a $5 million Bitcoin endowment. Then, in October of the same year, Atlanta-based Emory University disclosed ownership of more than $14 million worth of shares of the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust. Showcasing the growing appetite for digital asset exposure, increasingly more institutional funds, publicly listed companies, and nation states are racing to gain access to the apex crypto. The Bitcoin price soared above $97,500 on Friday for the first time since February, rebounding from a local low around $75,000 in early April. The asset is currently trading hands at $96,170, according to data from CoinGecko.

The holdings report filed on Friday shows the university owned 105,000 shares of IBIT, valued around $4.9 million as of the first quarter’s end on March 31. The IBIT shares were not listed on the previous quarter’s filing. The shares are currently valued at about $5.8 million. While a significant investment, the position is just a drop in the bucket for an endowment that increased to more than $7.2 billion at the end of its 2024 fiscal year. “Over the past few decades, the financial markets have significantly increased in complexity, and as the value of the endowment has grown, Brown has adapted,” its 2024 endowment report reads. “Today, a team of professional investors pursues a diverse set of investment strategies that require high levels of expertise and investment acumen.” The university’s portfolio includes diversified holdings that include “investments in stocks, bonds, private companies, real estate, and commodities.” Brown is not the first university to seek exposure to Bitcoin. In May 2024, the University of Austin (UATX) collaborated with Bitcoin services company Unchained to create a $5 million Bitcoin endowment. Then in October, Atlanta’s Emory University reported nearly $16 million in Bitcoin exposure via the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust. Its most recently filed holdings report shows a reduction in shares, but around $22 million in Bitcoin exposure thanks to the asset’s price rise. It also showcases more than $1 million worth of shares in leading crypto exchange, Coinbase. The trio of universities fit alongside a growing list of institutions—from publicly traded companies to world governments—that are racing to gain access to crypto’s largest asset by market cap. The price of Bitcoin neared $98,000 on Friday for the first time since February, rebounding from a local low around $75,000 in early April. It's currently priced at $96,330.

Title: Elon Musk and His DOGE Bro Have Cashed In on Americans’ Retirement Savings

By Matthew Cunningham-Cook In the lead up to the April 1 election for the Wisconsin state Supreme Court, a little-known private equity executive by the name of Antonio Gracias joined Tesla billionaire Elon Musk on stage as the latter launched into a tirade clearly inspired by the white supremacist Great Replacement Theory — the discredited canard that the Biden administration was letting in millions of “illegals” to engage in mass voter fraud. On the dais, Gracias described how his foray into Social Security had revealed something already widely known to immigration policymakers: that the Biden administration had substantially expanded the Temporary Protected Status program, allowing millions of immigrants to enter and work in the country legally. These noncitizens were given Social Security numbers, as is completely standard — in fact, the process was automated during Trump’s first term — but Gracias and Musk, the world’s richest man, treated it like a scandal. “We started at the top of the system mapping the whole system of Social Security to understand where the fraud was — this is what jumped out at us,” Gracias said. “When we saw these numbers, we asked ‘What is this?’ In ‘21, you see 270,000 people, it goes all the way to 2.1 million in ‘24. These are noncitizens that are getting Social Security numbers. … This literally blew us away. We went there to find fraud, and we found this by accident.” Noting that his parents and siblings, like Musk, are immigrants, Gracias added, “I’m pro-legal immigration — this is about America and the future of America.” The crowd of conservatives gasped as the billionaires made it sound as if they and their team at Trump’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency had finally found proof of the waste, fraud, and abuse in the Social Security Administration that Musk has repeatedly talked about — examples that might help justify the massive upheaval that DOGE has created within the agency that manages America’s core retirement program. Editor’s picks The 100 Best TV Episodes of All Time The 250 Greatest Albums of the 21st Century So Far The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time The 200 Greatest Singers of All Time Under their watch, DOGE has moved to fire thousands of SSA workers, shutter dozens of field offices, and implement sweeping changes that are expected to make it more difficult for Social Security recipients to get their payments on time, if at all. The administration has reportedly declared millions of people dead within the Social Security program, making live people fight for their payments, and has started deliberately marking some immigrants as deceased. (A White House spokesperson says SSA’s “death data” is “being reviewed by three separate teams,” and that the immigrants targeted were either “on the terrorist watch list” or have “FBI criminal records.”) Meanwhile, Social Security beneficiaries may have to wait until November to receive the higher payments they were promised in a law passed last year. Despite all of Musk and Gracias’ rhetoric about rooting out waste, fraud, and abuse in Social Security, scant attention has been paid to how the pair has become phenomenally wealthy with support from Americans’ retirement funds. It’s well-known that Musk’s space company, SpaceX, has long cashed in on federal contracts — a trend turbocharged by Trump’s administration. Gracias, for his part, has relied on significant investments from public retirement systems to fund his firm’s deals. In the past decade, Gracias’ private equity firm, Valor Equity Partners, has received at least $1.7 billion in investment commitments from state and local pension funds — which manage the retirement savings of unionized teachers, firefighters, social workers, bus drivers, and cops — according to a Rolling Stone review of public documents. Much of this money has come from Democratic states and locales. For its most recent fund, Valor received $800 million in investment commitments from a range of state and local pension funds. Investors include the California Public Employees’ Retirement System; the California State Teachers’ Retirement System; the Illinois Municipal Retirement Fund; the New York State Teachers’ Retirement System; a range of New York City pension funds; the Philadelphia Board of Pensions and Retirement; and the Hartford Municipal Employees Retirement Fund in Connecticut. Related Content Jon Voight Confirms He Suggested Movie Tariffs to Trump Jon Stewart Has a Shark Tank Pitch to Stop Americans From Taking Trump's 'Bait' Yet Another GOP Town Hall Descends Into Chaos as Constituents Revolt Russia Is Growing Stronger, But Victory in Ukraine Remains Elusive Valor disclosed in a press release last August that this same fund has invested in Musk’s SpaceX and his artificial intelligence company xAI. Musk recently used xAI to purchase his social media platform X (formerly Twitter) at a valuation of $33 billion, a 25-percent haircut from the $44 billion he spent to buy Twitter. (The platform’s ad revenues have cratered under Musk’s stewardship.) With a typical management fee of two percent, Gracias’ firm stands to accumulate tens of millions of dollars annually from the public funds no matter how its investments perform. While Gracias complains about 1.3 million immigrants being on Medicaid — numbers that have not been independently verified by Rolling Stone, but would mean these immigrants are getting access to preventive care and saving hospitals money on emergency room expenses — Gracias himself is accruing large profits from the management fees that his firm charges government retirement systems. Valor and DOGE did not respond to Rolling Stone’s requests for comment. A 54-year-old University of Chicago Law School alum who has been associated with Musk since the PayPal days, Gracias has played a key role in helping prop up Musk’s embattled yet sprawling business empire. He’s a longtime investor in Musk’s companies, a significant Tesla shareholder, and former Tesla board member. Gracias’ longstanding friendship and business dealings with Musk have been lucrative for both men. Musk is worth an estimated $386 billion, in large part due to his Tesla holdings. Gracias has a net worth of $2.2 billion, much of it tied to his holdings of Tesla stock. Gracias lent Musk $1 million early in Musk’s ownership of Tesla, and his firm has invested in nearly every Musk company, including SpaceX. The Trump administration has been good to them. SpaceX, which has received billions of dollars from government contracts, has raked in billions more under the Trump administration. Agencies across the federal government are increasingly using Starlink, SpaceX’s satellite internet business. SpaceX and defense contractor Anduril, another company that Gracias’ firm has invested in, are the frontrunners to build Trump’s proposed “Golden Dome” missile shield, a proposal that experts estimate will cost hundreds of billions of dollars. In late April, the Wall Street Journal reported on Gracias’ lucrative side hustle — selling stakes in Musk’s private companies like SpaceX. A White House spokesperson says, “As for concerns regarding conflicts of interest between Elon Musk and DOGE, President Trump has stated he will not allow conflicts, and Elon himself has committed to recusing himself from potential conflicts.” As Trump and Musk have run roughshod over the law to pursue drastic cuts of the federal government through DOGE, they have been supported by an eclectic cast of characters. While 19-year olds or those with openly racist proclivities or nicknames like “Big Balls” get the bulk of media attention, arguably nobody has been more important to implementing DOGE’s slash-and-burn agenda than Gracias. With his entry into the heights of Washington policymaking, Gracias, like Musk, has brought an overall mentality to the Trump administration with well-defined origins in private equity. Core to the history of private equity is a conception that government is a vehicle for private profit, and that the point of business is to extract as much cash as possible from targets, no matter the impact. Private equity started in earnest thanks to a rule change by Jimmy Carter in 1979 that allowed private equity to fundraise from private sector pension funds. (Public pension cash began to flow shortly thereafter.) But with the critical benefits of millions of Americans at issue, along with basic principles like the rule of law and a government that functions, the stakes couldn’t be higher. “It does seem like Musk and DOGE are applying private equity tactics to the government,” says Brendan Ballou, a former attorney at the Department of Justice who wrote the 2023 book Plunder: Private Equity’s Plan to Pillage America. As an example, Ballou notes, “They’re exploring sale leasebacks to sell underlying government property and lease it back to itself,” a hallmark of the private equity model. “They’re pursuing the same type of cost-cutting techniques that private equity firms pursue when they take over a company, which end up costing you vastly more money in the long run. Slashing the IRS might save you money for one year, but it’s devastating in the future. It’s almost comical how similar it is to the takeover of a company by a private equity firm, what they are doing to the government.” As Gracias is primed to reap a windfall from the Golden (no, not Teapot) Dome, the DOGE-led Social Security cuts he has helped to oversee could send the program cratering down the road to privatization — another classic hobbyhorse of a Wall Street eager to profit from the nearly $3 trillion in the Social Security Trust Fund that is currently invested in U.S. Treasuries. (BlackRock, whose CEO Larry Fink recently resuscitated the long-discredited idea of investing part of Social Security in Wall Street-controlled private accounts, did Musk a massive favor last year when the financial firm voted its investors’ proxies in favor of Musk’s record-setting $46 billion Tesla pay package.) Gracias began working with the Social Security Administration in early February. By the end of the month, the SSA had announced its intentions to cut 7,000 positions out of the agency’s 57,000-person workforce. Dozens of Social Security offices are expected to close, while DOGE pushes major technological changes that could make more people need to visit those offices. A White House spokesperson says SSA has only lost 2,000 workers so far, with most departing voluntarily, and adds that “the agency has not permanently closed or announced the permanent closure of any local field office.” “President Trump established the Department of Government Efficiency to modernize government operations and eliminate waste, fraud and abuse,” the spokesperson continues. “At the Social Security Administration, the DOGE team has delivered — upgrading technology systems, implementing anti-fraud tools, improving the accuracy of death records, and stopping illegal aliens from collecting benefits. President Trump remains committed to always protecting Social Security.” Additionally, Gracias has reportedly led a DOGE task force working with the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Health and Human Services to integrate sensitive personal data from Social Security, with the apparent goal of aiding Trump’s deportation dragnet. Speaking about DOGE’s efforts in the Social Security Administration, former SSA Commissioner Martin O’Malley said in March, “Most of the actions necessary to create a total system collapse of the Social Security Administration have been taken.” In late April, the Trump SSA pledged that they would seek to convert large swaths of SSA employees to “Schedule F,” which would effectively eliminate longstanding civil service protections and serve to speed up firings at the agency. DOGE appears to have been able to circumvent a federal judge’s March ruling barring its access to SSA data with Trump appointing one of DOGE’s own as chief information officer of the Social Security Administration. That role is currently being held by Scott Coulter, who used to work for private equity giant Blackstone and Lone Pine Capital, a hedge fund, and has worked as a DOGE apparatchik. All of this is out of the private equity playbook, says Samir Sonti, a professor at the Murphy Institute at the City University of New York. “Private equity has profited immensely in recent decades off of asset stripping — using public resources to plunder businesses and communities, leaving behind carcasses of enterprises in many cases,” he says. “Fundamentally, private equity is really about devastating the public good for private gain. DOGE is executing something very similar at the federal level. But they’re gutting not just a specific enterprise or community but the entire federal government, to advance a longer-term desire among corporate interests in this country to free themselves from any public or social oversight. In many ways, what we’re seeing with DOGE is the private equity asset stripping model [taken] to its logical conclusion.” Private equity firms in the U.S. — anchored by big names Blackstone, Apollo, Carlyle, and KKR — manage over $3.1 trillion in assets, and control outright major firms like Medline, the largest medical supply firm in the U.S., and Allied Universal, the world’s largest private security firm. Companies owned outright by private equity firms employ over 12 million people in the U.S., according to research by the Private Equity Stakeholder Project. Employees of private equity firms spent $236 million on campaign contributions in the 2024 election. The American Investment Council, a lobbying group for private equity, has estimated that about half of private equity’s capital that is invested in America comes from U.S. public pension funds. Private equity is distinguished by its lack of regulation, limited transparency, high fees, and vulnerability to misconduct. A leaked 2020 report from the FBI found that private equity firms, along with their closely related siblings in asset management, hedge funds, are widely used to conduct illicit money laundering operations. “Public pension funds are one of the biggest sources of capital for private equity firms,” says Oscar Valdés Viera, who analyzes private equity at Americans for Financial Reform. “Workers indirectly fund private equity’s predatory practices through their pension funds. The private equity billionaires benefit from tax loopholes and giveaways that the rest of us do not get,” he says, pointing out the carried interest tax deduction, which allows private equity managers to get much of their income taxed at the lower long-term capital gains tax rate than the ordinary income tax rate. “They charge a lot of fees, like management fees, professional fees, director and officer fees, accounting fees, transfer agent fees, and most of these fees are coming directly from pension funds and similar investors,” he says. “It’s just insane the amount of fees that they charge from these pension funds.” Reflecting the broad secrecy of his industry, much of what Gracias is doing at DOGE remains closed off to the public eye. On April 21, the American Civil Liberties Union sued the Social Security Administration for failing to respond to Freedom of Information Act requests related to its handling of the personal data of millions of Americans, stating: “The American people have an urgent need to know if their private financial, medical, and personal records are being illegally accessed, analyzed, or weaponized by Trump’s unaccountable team of unvetted outsiders.” Trending Stories People Are Losing Loved Ones to AI-Fueled Spiritual Fantasies Could 100 Men Beat a Gorilla in a Fight? Here's What Primatologists Say Piper Rockelle Has a Lot to Say About That Netflix Documentary Yet Another GOP Town Hall Descends Into Chaos as Constituents Revolt Brett Christophers, a professor at Sweden’s Uppsala University who has studied asset management, tells Rolling Stone that the actions of DOGE clearly resemble foundational principles of the private equity industry. “When private equity investors go into operating companies, the most consistent theme across all their investments is cost cutting as a way in theory to maximize their investment and make companies lean and more valuable to other potential investors,” he says. “It sounds like what’s going on with DOGE is that Musk and the people working with him are trying to treat the government in the same way.” We want to hear it.

Title: Bitcoin set for $3B short squeeze! How it will fuel BTC’s $100K rally

Can institutional cash into IBIT rocket Bitcoin past $100K and into six-figure territory? Bitcoin [BTC] is on the brink of something big. With over $3 billion in short positions stacked below $100k, a massive short squeeze is primed for takeoff. And this time, BlackRock’s IBIT spot ETF could be the spark that sends BTC soaring into six-figure territory. BlackRock is absolutely dominating the scene with 52% of the spot Bitcoin ETF market, holding a hefty 604,049 BTC in its treasury. Meanwhile, rivals Fidelity and Grayscale are trailing with just 17%. Together, spot ETFs account for 5.82% of Bitcoin’s circulating supply, with a combined 1.154 million BTC. Given BlackRock’s commanding position, it is a key player in Bitcoin’s next big market move. Source: X Since the 21st of April, IBIT alone has seen nearly $4 billion in inflows, right as Bitcoin smashed through the $85k resistance wall. Hence, tightening supply and turning up the pressure on short sellers. And institutional adoption? It’s not just talk. Brown University just allocated $4.9 million to IBIT, a 2% chunk of its $216 million endowment. That’s a signal that even Ivy League capital is leaning into the Bitcoin narrative. Meanwhile, net flows into rival spot ETFs remain flat, reinforcing the idea that BlackRock is driving the lion’s share of institutional momentum. With IBIT absorbing the bulk of inflows, BTC’s push toward the $100k mark could be fueled not by “hype” — but by cold, hard capital. According to AMBCrypto, fear is baked into the equation. A clean break above $100k would take Bitcoin back to early Q1 highs – prime territory for profit-taking. Short-term holders who’ve morphed into long-term holders may see this as their exit ramp, and bears won’t hesitate to pounce. Even now, as BTC grinds against the stubborn $96k resistance, market sentiment remains fragile. Over 63% of Binance’s BTC/USDT perpetual traders are skewed short, highlighting the hesitation. But that could flip fast. With institutional cash flooding into Bitcoin via IBIT, a liquidity sweep could turn that fear into FOMO in no time. At $97.5K, there’s already $12.46 million in leveraged positions active on the 12-hour lookback chart. A quick move could trigger liquidations and send BTC toward higher targets. Source: CoinGlass In this landscape, IBIT isn’t just another fund – it’s the rocket fuel Bitcoin needs to power through resistance and reclaim the $100k level.

Title: Leinster may be semi-final specialists, but getting any further is often a coin toss

Is there a sudden outbreak of Leinster “big-game fatigue” out there? Let’s pause for a moment and put this weekend’s Champions Cup semi-finals into context. It actually is an achievement to be one of the last quartet in any competition. Leinster and Toulouse are specialists at reaching this stage in the Champions Cup. Everyone else should be so lucky. To start with the bleedin’ obvious, only four teams out of the 24 which started out this season have managed the feat. As the URC, Top 14 and Premiership pauses, the other 20 would happily swap places with those hogging the stage this weekend. Of course, reaching a final belongs to an even more exclusive club. Take Leinster. In the 30 years of what is now the Champions Cup, their encounter with Northampton on Saturday will be their 16th semi-final. If you stop and think about it, that truly is exceptional. Unsurprisingly, the only club to have reached more semi-finals are Toulouse. Against Bordeaux Bègles on Sunday, they will be playing their 17th semi-final. By contrast, Northampton are playing in their fifth and Bordeaux Bègles just their second. What might be a little more surprising is that even for the two highest achievers in the history of the tournament, there are no guarantees for Leinster and Toulouse when it comes to this stage of the tournament. Of Leinster’s 15 semi-finals to date, they have won eight and lost seven. For their part, Toulouse have also endured their fair share of disappointment at this stage, winning eight and losing eight of their previous 16. So, if there is a small element of big-game fatigue among Leinster fans, perhaps understandably, like all of us they have short memories. Admittedly it’s 30 years ago since Leinster reached their first semi-final way back in the inaugural European Cup in 1995-96 when they, as well as Munster and Ulster, were among a dozen teams drawn from France, Wales, Italy and Romania. Furthermore, all Leinster had to do was beat Milan away and Pontypridd at home to reach the last four. Almost despite themselves. Niall Woods was Leinster’s left winger in the province’s competition debut in Milan on November 1st, 1995, when the attendance was recorded as 1,200. “The game kicked off at 2.30 on a Wednesday afternoon, and it was a mudbath. Diego Dominguez was playing,” recalls Woods of the normally prolific Argentinian-born Italian outhalf. “He actually kicked two out of eight. It was filthy, as in the fighting, the gouging, the works. Obviously, I didn’t see any of that, nor was I anywhere near it.” [ Rugby analysis: Leinster attack looking more and more comfortable in chaosOpens in new window ] [ Matt Williams: Leinster can get past Northampton if they have planned for a new and improved opponentOpens in new window ] Despite Dominguez losing his radar, Leinster were losing the game late on. “I got the ball on the 10-yard line, at outhalf from a ruck in the middle of the field. I stepped a fella and was just gone. These were the days when if you broke the first line, then you just had to round the fullback and we won by three points,” says Woods of Leinster’s 24-21 victory. I remember getting a cheque, I think for £175 to play because you were technically allowed to be paid at that stage “The reason I remember is that ‘Munch’ (aka Shane Byrne) was asked in an interview for the best try he ever saw and he said that one. I read it and laughed and said ‘fair play Munch’. We were in [Blackrock] school together, so maybe that’s why.” Five weeks later, on a Wednesday night under lights, in what was also the first season of professionalism, Leinster beat Pontypridd 23-22 in Lansdowne Road to top their “group” and earn a home semi-final. “I remember getting a cheque, I think for £175 to play because you were technically allowed to be paid at that stage,” says Woods. Leinster’s first of 16 semi-finals was against Cardiff in Lansdowne Road on December 30th, 1995. “Conor [O’Shea] was with London Irish and Conor came home on standby in case I failed the fitness test. I failed the fitness test, I’d say at 11 o’clock. It was a horrendous day, blowing a gale and freezing, so I was quite happy. It wasn’t a day for me,” recalls Woods with a self-mocking chuckle. The attendance was 7,350. “Which was big in those days,” he stresses. “You’d get 2-4,000 max in those days in Donnybrook. It was decent, put it that way, although we played Australia in 1992 and there was probably 20,000 people there; they had won the World Cup in 1991 and they were fully loaded.” A European Cup semi-final was unchartered and underappreciated territory. He added: “It was totally unknown. It was something a bit different, playing someone from a different country in a game that meant something as opposed to a friendly. We played against New South Wales that season and I think we played eight games. Up to that point we played four games a year. “Cardiff were the most stacked team of the Welsh at that stage. They were the equivalent of Leinster now. As a spectacle, the game wasn’t great. The wind was horrific. Mary Robinson was President and they didn’t bring her out on to the pitch because it was so windy.” Leinster were beaten 23-14 and nobody was really complaining. “I don’t remember being overly bothered that we lost. We did all right because we got to the semis, even if we only won two matches to get there. It was enjoyable and it was a bit different.” Toulouse beat Cardiff at Cardiff Arms Park in the final a week later, with 21,800 in attendance, to give the European Cup lift-off. Whether it was over-confidence or not I don’t know It was seven years later when Leinster reached the semi-finals, meeting Perpignan at Lansdowne Road in April 2003. As evidenced by the 37,800 attendance, expectations were altogether higher. Woods had retired in 2001 after a playing career with Trinity, Blackrock, Leinster, Ireland, London Irish and Harlequins. He then worked for the English Players’ Union before coming home in January 2003 to set up the Irish Rugby Players’ Union (IRUPA). But in Leinster’s biggest game of the 2002-03 season, their season ended with an anticlimactic 21-14 defeat. “They didn’t perform on the day at all,” says Woods. “Whether it was over-confidence or not I don’t know. They never got going. It was hugely disappointing.” The pivotal matches in Leinster’s history were the Heineken Cup semi-finals against Munster in 2006 at Lansdowne Road and 2009 in Croke Park. Technically, the first was a “home” semi-final, though it was awash in red and felt like an away match. The second was an “away” tie that was more akin to a neutral-venue fixture given the even split between blue and red in a record-setting attendance of 82,208. “In 2006, ‘Rog’ dummies and scores under the sticks and in ’09 Drico intercepts Rog’s pass to score. They were the two defining moments,” says Woods with reference to Ronan O’Gara and Brian O’Driscoll. “The difference in colour was stark. In ’06 it was so red, when the Leinster supporters weren’t as strong as they are now, whereas in ’09 it was even.” Leinster had reached a point of no return. The 25-6 win led to a breakthrough triumph three weeks later against Leicester in Murrayfield. “It had started with the quarter-final in ‘Quins, the bloodgate game and that [6-5] win gave them belief. Even the final in Edinburgh was a poor enough game against Leicester, but it would always be scrappy against them. But they managed to do it. “In the semi, Leinster were notably better on the day. The [2009] Grand Slam probably helped. There was better quality throughout the Leinster team than there had been three years earlier, especially with Isa [Nacewa] and Rocky [Elsom] there.” Leinster have reached another 10 semi-finals since that day, winning seven of them, and the key has been earning home semi-finals through their performances in the pool stages. Leinster have won all six ensuing semi-finals at home, whereas they have won only one of four away from home. Leinster lost away to Toulouse as reigning champions in the 2010 semi-finals, when Johnny Sexton was injured, but have beaten Toulouse in four of the subsequent six semi-finals at home. There was defeat to Toulon in 2015 at the Stade Velodrome in Marseille, when Jimmy Gopperth’s drop-goal attempt to win the game was narrowly wide before Leinster were beaten in extra-time. They lost a last-four tie against Clermont in Lyon in 2017 and lost behind closed doors in La Rochelle four years ago. Viewed in that context, Leinster’s 19-15 win over a brilliant Clermont side [Julien Bonnaire, Morgan Parra, Wesley Fofana, Aurélien Rougerie and co] in Bordeaux in 2012 has arguably been their finest semi-final victory of all so far. “That was the inside pass to Rob Kearney and Cian Healy’s finish,” says Woods – who stepped down as the IRUPA CEO in January 2011 to set up what is now the Navy Blue sports agency – of the famous Joe Schmidt strike play. There was also the end-game stand on their own line, Gordon D’Arcy’s tackle on Fofana to dislodge the ball before he grounded it and Seán O’Brien hanging on for dear life in the jackal to earn the final turnover penalty. “I’d say that was their best ever semi-final win, considering who it was against and it was away from home,” says Woods, and to put that victory in context it was only the second semi-final win in France by an Irish or UK side – Munster having achieved the first in 2000 against Toulouse, also in Bordeaux. Reaching semi-finals should never be taken for granted, albeit as Woods says: “Leinster do have the majority of the Irish team and their budget is massive, above the French clubs as well as the English clubs now. But if Leinster are in any way off, the Saints have enough firepower to do damage.” Indeed, as history shows us, nor do semi-finals, even at home, come with any guarantees. “Go back to ’03, against Perpignan. They should have beaten Perpignan. They should never have lost that.” 1995-96: Leinster 14 Cardiff 23 (Lansdowne Road) 2002-03: Leinster 14 Perpignan 21 (Lansdowne Road) 2005-06: Leinster 6 Munster 30 (Lansdowne Road) 2008-09: Munster 6 Leinster 25 (Croke Park) 2009-10: Toulouse 26 Leinster 16 (Le Stadium, Toulouse) 2010-11: Leinster 32 Toulouse 23 (Aviva Stadium) 2011-12: Clermont 15 Leinster 19 (Stade Chaban-Delmas, Bordeaux) 2014-15: Toulon 25 Leinster 20 aet (Stade Velodrome, Marseille) 2016-17: Clermont 27 Leinster 22 (Matmut de Gerland, Lyon) 2017-18: Leinster 38 Scarlets 16 (Aviva Stadium) 2018-19: Leinster 30 Toulouse 12 (Aviva Stadium) 2020-21: La Rochelle 32 Leinster 23 (Stade Deflandre, La Rochelle) 2021-22: Leinster 40 Toulouse 17 (Aviva Stadium) 2022-23: Leinster 41 Toulouse 22 (Aviva Stadium) 2023-24: Leinster 20 Northampton 17 (Croke Park) © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Crypto-stocks correlation returns as Bitcoin’s rally sparks surge in equities

Bitcoin’s hike has revived its correlation with equities, driven by institutional interest. Bitcoin’s [BTC] price has appreciated significantly over the last few days, with the same driving renewed interest in the digital asset and equities connected to it. With institutional players increasingly looking towards Bitcoin as an asset class, the relationship between BTC and traditional equities has strengthened too. This alignment can be best evidenced by the performances of companies holding large Bitcoin reserves, as well as those in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Most of their stock prices have been buoyed by Bitcoin’s own momentum. Bitcoin’s remarkable hike in value has had a tangible impact on the stock prices of crypto-related businesses. At press time, BTC was trading at $96,684, following a 1.41% hike in the last 24 hours. Companies like MicroStrategy, which holds over 550,000 Bitcoins, saw its shares rise dramatically, with a 400% increase this year alone. Similarly, Cantor Equity Partners’ stock surged by 462% after merging with a crypto firm. To put it simply, BTC’s price action has had an effect on not just the cryptocurrency market, but also on the stock prices of companies in related sectors. Here, it’s worth pointing out that the correlation between Bitcoin and U.S equities, particularly the Nasdaq 100, climbed to unprecedented levels recently. In fact, BTC’s 30-day correlation with the Nasdaq 100 hit +0.70 on the charts. This alignment seemed to highlight the increasing parallel movement of BTC with traditional equities, particularly tech stocks. As major tech companies continue to report strong earnings, Bitcoin has tracked these trends closely, reflecting a shared investor sentiment towards risk-on assets. Source: TradingView Institutional adoption of Bitcoin is also a major factor in strengthening its correlation with equities. Bitcoin ETFs have become increasingly popular, with large financial institutions like BlackRock and Fidelity providing institutional investors with exposure to the cryptocurrency. The growing acceptance of BTC as a mainstream investment vehicle is shifting investor sentiment, with BTC increasingly seen as a risk-on asset, much like equities. As a result, Bitcoin’s price movements are beginning to mirror those of the broader stock market. Particularly in sectors such as technology. Now, despite Bitcoin’s strong performance, its volatility remains a concern for many investors. While its recent surge has been impressive, experts believe that Bitcoin’s role as a safe-haven asset is still uncertain. Although BTC has shown resilience, its price swings can be drastic. And, many investors remain cautious about its potential to sustain long-term growth without further market stabilization. However, the increasing institutional interest in BTC and the broader integration of digital assets into the financial system suggest that the future of BTC may be more secure than ever before. Bitcoin’s price surge has affected the cryptocurrency market. However, it has also led to a renewed correlation with equities, particularly in the tech sector. Institutional adoption and the growing acceptance of BTC as a mainstream asset have helped drive this shift. While volatility remains a concern, the increasing integration of BTC into traditional markets points to a promising future for both Bitcoin and crypto-related equities.

Title: Major Art Patrons Donated to Trump Inauguration: Report

By Karen K. Ho Senior Writer, ARTnews Major art collectors Warren Stephens, Ken Griffin, and Paul Singer, as well as Charles and Helen Schwab were among the top individual donors to President Donald Trump’s inauguration fundraising committee. The top individual donor to President Trump’s 2025 inauguration was Stephens, who gave $4 million and is a major donor to the Arkansas Museum of Fine Art, according to data released by the Federal Election Commission and new analysis from Open Secrets, a nonprofit research and government transparency group based in Washington, DC. Related Articles Billionaire Art Collector Ken Griffin Says US Is 'Eroding' Its Brand Top 200 Collectors Bernard Arnault, Alice Walton and Jeff Bezos Lose Billions Again After Major Stock Sell-Offs In 2023 the Arkansas Museum of Fine Arts announced that Warren Stephens and his wife, Harriet, endowed eight galleries. The couple also chair the museum’s building committee and foundation board, as well as cochairing its successful capital campaign, which raised more than $160 million. Until last year, Stephens was the CEO of his namesake financial services firm headquartered in Little Rock. Trump nominated him to be ambassador to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and North Ireland in December. Stephens was confirmed to the position by the US Senate on April 29. Other seven-figure donations from individuals to President Trump’s 2025 inauguration included $1.1 million from Top 200 collectors Charles and Helen Schwab, $1 million from Top 200 collector and Citadel founder Ken Griffin, as well as $1 million from art collector and Elliott Management founder Paul Singer. Federal filings showed Trump raised more than $239 million for his second inauguration, far exceeding the $107 million raised in 2017. By comparison, Joe Biden raised $61 million for his inauguration in 2021, and Barack Obama raised $44 million and $53 million for his inaugurations in 2013 and 2009, respectively. Many large US companies also made donations to Trump’s 2025 inauguration, including donations of $1 million from Amazon, which was founded by Top 200 collector Jeff Bezos; $1 million from Blackrock Financial Management Inc, whose cofounder and CEO is Top 200 collector Larry Fink; and $1 million from Tyson Shared Services Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Tyson Foods. The current chairman of Tyson Foods, John H. Tyson, is also chairman of the board at the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Bentonville, Arkansas. The institution awards the annual Don Tyson Prize for American Art, worth $200,000, and named for the former chairman and CEO of Tyson Foods. In addition to donations for President Trump’s inauguration fundraising committee, data from the FEC and Open Secrets show that Griffin donated $100 million to help elect conservatives, the fifth-largest amount for individual contributions to federal election spending for 2024. Griffin’s largest disclosed donations were to the Senate Leadership Fund, on four separate occasions, totaling $30 million. He also made donations totaling $15 million to the Congressional Leadership Fund, $15 million to the Keystone Renewal PAC and $10 million to Maryland’s Future, a single-candidate super political action committee in support of Republican Larry Hogan for the US Senate. By comparison, Singer donated $64.15 million (including a total of $27 million to the Senate Leadership Fund, and $14.5 million to the Congressional Leadership Fund), Stephens donated $23.4 million (including a total of $5.5 million to Senate Leadership Fund, $2.91 million to SFA Fund, and $2.75 million to Congressional Leadership Fund), while the Schwabs donated $9.3 million (including $6 million for the Senate Leadership Fund and $3 million for the Congressional Leadership Fund). Last month, Griffin told Semafor senior editor Gina Chon the US was “eroding” its brand as a result of many of the economic policy changes under Trump. Announcements of tariffs have resulted in volatility in the stock markets, a sell-off in US government bonds, and left art professionals scrambling. Volatility in global stock markets also resulted in the net worth of many Top 200 collectors declining by billions of dollars, including a drop of more than $6.6 billion for Bezos between April 3 and April 7.

Title: Crypto market today: Bitcoin hits $97K as Dogecoin, Sonic, Litecoin & AERO lead altcoin rally
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/crypto-market-today-bitcoin-hits-97k-as-dogecoin-sonic-litecoin-aero-lead-altcoin-rally/
Time Published: 2025-05-02T21:00:32Z

Bitcoin rallies past $97K, sparking altcoin gains as net outflows and ETF inflows boost sentiment. Bitcoin [BTC] has surged past $97,000, reclaiming a critical level and reinforcing bullish momentum across the market. This move follows weeks of consolidation, and now positions Bitcoin just steps away from testing the psychological $100K resistance. Institutional appetite remains strong, with firms like BlackRock’s IBIT fund surpassing $43 billion in assets under management due to massive inflows over the past two weeks These developments, combined with technical confirmation of a pennant breakout, suggest confidence is returning fast, and price discovery may soon resume above historical highs. Altcoins have mirrored Bitcoin’s momentum, with capital rotating into risk-on tokens as sentiment improves. Market optimism has been fueled by a rebound in social engagement, a rise in Open Interest across derivatives, and declining exchange reserves. Notably, altcoin market dominance has climbed, signaling broader participation. Investors appear to be positioning ahead of potential macro catalysts, including expected ETF-related announcements and further easing in global monetary conditions. As a result, the market outlook has grown increasingly optimistic, with both majors and microcaps seeing renewed demand and stronger technical setups. Several altcoins are outperforming amid the rally, each driven by unique catalysts. Dogecoin [DOGE] is enjoying revived meme coin enthusiasm, backed by surging social dominance and speculative flows. Sonic [S] has gained traction following major integrations and a notable rise in its total value locked, which underscores increasing utility. Litecoin [LTC], long seen as a conservative alternative to Bitcoin, is riding a wave of ETF optimism and broader market interest. Meanwhile, Aerodrome [AERO] is gaining attention as activity on the Base chain expands. These tokens reflect growing appetite for diverse risk profiles during bullish cycles. Institutional appetite continues to be a major catalyst for the current rally, with consistent ETF inflows and strategic positioning by large funds like BlackRock. However, what further strengthens the bullish outlook is the negative exchange netflow data. A net outflow of approximately 259.49 million coins, representing a -1.6% change, indicates that more assets are leaving exchanges than entering. This suggests investors are moving their holdings to cold storage or DeFi protocols, reducing sell-side pressure. When combined with clearer regulatory momentum, this trend highlights a strong conviction in long-term crypto exposure. Source: CryptoQuant The rally appears structurally sound, driven by both macro tailwinds and on-chain strength. With Bitcoin eyeing six figures and altcoins showing sector-wide participation, the market is clearly regaining confidence. If institutional flows and regulatory momentum persist, the current bullish trend could evolve into a sustained move higher across the board.

Title: Are Crypto Markets Going Mainstream? What Treasury Execs Should Know

Highlights Institutional moves this week from state and federal governments, and even Ivy League institutions are providing a growing signal that bitcoin and other digital assets are becoming entrenched in traditional financial operations. Major financial firms like Morgan Stanley, Charles Schwab and BlackRock are expanding crypto services, from ETFs to blockchain-powered fund classes. The institutionalization of digital assets, especially bitcoin ETFs and stablecoins, is reshaping enterprise treasury strategies — enabling diversification, real-time settlements and cross-border liquidity amid growing regulatory clarity. The first publicly traded bitcoin financial services company rang the Nasdaq opening bell on Friday (May 2). The invitation given to Fold Holdings Inc. is just one signal among many, that, in a span of just a few months, cryptocurrency has entered a new phase of mainstream financial adoption. And it’s just scratching the surface of a week that also saw the Arizona State Legislature move to the governor’s desk a pair of bills that could pave the way to create the country’s first state-level bitcoin reserve, while Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) is doubling down on its own corporate bitcoin stockpile by raising $84 billion to buy more of the nominal crypto asset. “With over 70 public companies worldwide now adopting a Bitcoin treasury standard, we are proud to be at the forefront in pioneering this space,” Strategy President and Chief Executive Officer said Phong Le said in a Thursday (May 1) earnings press release. Even the Ivy-league institution Brown University has recently disclosed a $4.9 million investment in BlackRock’s bitcoin ETF, signaling a broader acceptance of cryptocurrencies in diversified portfolios. Against this backdrop, observers believe it is becoming increasingly held, across Wall Street and beyond, that digital assets may no longer be confined to speculative circles. As bitcoin ETFs become a growing component of diversified portfolios and regulatory frameworks begin to crystallize, the decentralization dream that once defined crypto appears to be giving way to a new era of structured integration. Read also: The Digital Asset Primer: Corporate Treasury Moves From HODL to Yield It’s no longer a novelty to see major investment firms exploring crypto, but 2025 has marked a turning point. Morgan Stanley is preparing to offer cryptocurrency trading to its vast E*Trade client base as soon as 2026, potentially introducing millions of retail investors to digital assets through a familiar platform. Meanwhile, Charles Schwab is gearing up to launch spot crypto trading for bitcoin and ethereum within the year, aiming to meet increasing demand from traditional investors seeking exposure. These moves are not isolated. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, is pushing blockchain technology deeper into conventional finance. The firm recently announced plans to register a new share class of its $150 billion money market fund on a blockchain, a step designed to enhance transparency and operational efficiency. Perhaps the most eye-catching development in 2025 has been the Trump family’s foray into stablecoins. The USD1 token, unveiled at a Dubai conference and reportedly used in a $2 billion Binance investment by Abu Dhabi’s MGX, has raised both eyebrows and strategic questions. The token is part of a broader push by Trump allies to position themselves as power brokers in the crypto world. “There’s certainly a change in how the administration views the digital assets industry,” Dan Boyle, partner at Boies Schiller Flexner told PYMNTS in an interview posted April 23. “This is not a confrontational posture.” Together, these developments signify a major realignment of the financial world. Crypto, once believed to be a fringe and risk-heavy domain, is now becoming a potential pillar of corporate strategy. But what does it all mean for corporate treasurers managing enterprise funds? See also: What Treasury Teams Can Learn From Central Banks’ Tokenization Projects The crypto landscape in 2025 introduces both opportunities and new complexities for corporate treasury teams. With bitcoin ETFs and institutional-grade platforms going live, treasurers have access to new, regulated asset classes. These can be useful for diversification, but they also require clear policy frameworks and risk management strategies. Moves like BlackRock’s tokenization of funds hint at a future where treasury instruments operate on blockchain rails. This could enable real-time settlement, improved auditability and operational efficiencies. As regulatory clarity emerges around stablecoins in particular, they are becoming potentially viable tools for cross-border payments and intra-company fund flows as treasurers investigate their use as liquid, programmable cash equivalents. As PYMNTS covered, stablecoin market capitalization reached an all-time high in April amid strong performance across cryptocurrency sectors. Regulatory maturation, the real-world quest for stablecoin utility, and the institutionalization of digital assets mark a turning point in which the Wild West days of crypto are being replaced by a convergence with mainstream finance, PYMNTS reported April 23.

Title: ‘XRP Is Not Dead’ — Crypto Influencer Explains Why Ripple’s XRP Could Still Be Crypto’s Biggest Sleeping Giant
URL: https://zycrypto.com/xrp-is-not-dead-crypto-influencer-explains-why-ripples-xrp-could-still-be-cryptos-biggest-sleeping-giant/

Full Content:
Popular crypto influencer John Squire has commented on the popular claim within the crypto community from critics labeling XRP as a “dead coin”. In Squire’s view, XRP is “loading,” potentially setting up for a monumental rally. In a May 1 lengthy post on X, John Squire noted that Ripple-affiliated cryptocurrency XRP is the only top 10 cryptocurrency to have been mired in a multi-year-long legal battle with the U.S. government and emerged victorious. Now that the case with the Securities and Exchange Commission has concluded, Squire believes XRP could witness a floodgate of institutional adoption, which could subsequently propel its price north. According to the pundit, big money is currently warming up as the CME Group prepares to roll out cash-settled XRP futures this month. It’s worth mentioning that a similar product from America’s leading exchange, Coinbase, launched in April, signaling institutional-grade interest in XRP. Squire backed this sentiment by citing rumors of a potential XRP trust from asset management giant BlackRock — arguably the most highly awaited XRP product. He claims this is not retail-driven hype but early indications of Wall Street quietly positioning itself. Squire further suggested that while many crypto projects pursue hype cycles, XRP is focused on the global international payments sector, which currently hovers at $150 trillion annually. Ripple has previously speculated that this market could rocket to $300 trillion by 2030. Ripple currently has active payment rails in Japan, Singapore, and the UAE. Squire stressed that this level of adoption is a sign that real-world use cases for XRP are already in motion. He also predicted that spot XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are now closer than ever after the SEC greenlighted similar products based on Bitcoin and Ether in 2024. Squire believes XRP’s underwhelming price performance is intentional. The asset has held steadily above the $2 mark despite many skeptics often predicting its doom. He further highlighted bullish on-chain metrics such as rising volume and a cooling RSI. Squire argues that smart money does not chase pumps, instead, it buys when the market is boring. In summaryXRP is:✔️ Battle-tested✔️ Institutionally aligned✔️ Legally resilient✔️ Technologically deployedThis isn’t hopium. This is asymmetric risk with real-world traction. That being said, Squire is convinced that XRP could be silently loading in the background, awaiting its moment to go parabolic. And when the sleeping giant of crypto finally awakens, as the influencer astutely puts it, “the whole game changes.”

Title: Natasha Oakley And Devin Brugman Join Hemp Period Brand Rif Care As Investors

ByYola Robert ByYola Robert, Senior Contributor. Rebecca Caputo, Natasha Oakley, Val Emanuel and Devin Brugman. Oakley and Brugman have joined Caputo ... More and Emanuel as investors to Rif Care. In 2020, Val Emanuel went through a major life change after uncovering hormone imbalances and high heavy metal levels in her body. Having struggled with hormonal imbalances, irregular periods, migraines, and painful, heavy periods for years, she decided to rid herself of toxic products and switch to organic personal care products. During this process, Emanuel realized that there were few high-quality, biodegradable, and innovative period care options for women. As a lover of hemp, she decided to pursue making disposable period products from hemp fiber, even though factories told her repeatedly it was impossible. Emanuel launched a crowdfunding campaign a year later, and her best friend and scientist, Rebecca Caputo, started helping. Caputo had also experienced hormone imbalance and infertility. Emanuel brought on Caputo in 2022 and the pair launched the first hemp fiber menstrual pads on the market known as Rif Care. Rif Care founders, Val Emanuel and Rebecca Caputo, pride themselves on educating women on period ... More health and non-toxic living. On track for over $1 million in sales in 2025 and in over 200 retail stores, Caputo and Emanuel have added new investors and founders of Monday Swimwear, Natasha Oakley and Devin Brugman, to their cap table. “Our first investor, a C-suite executive at BlackRock, had experience with contracts, M&A and also looked over every single deck and deal. I don’t know if we could have done it without him and he also was our BIGGEST cheerleader. Now, we are looking to bring on more influential women who know how to sell to and talk to other women marketing-wise. Natasha and Devin are amazing at direct-to-consumer selling, so we are using their advice and expertise as a guiding force for growing online. Before the investment, we did 500k in sales with only 10k spent on ads. Most of it has been organic through social media, word of mouth and smaller retail accounts so now we have money to fuel that growth,” they explained. Ashley Graham, Nancy Twine, La Familia Foundation, Crom Carmichael, Techstar and Jumpstart Foundry are also investors in the brand. In addition to direct-to-consumer growth, Rif Care will be using new investments to hire a sales team as they expand into more retailers nationwide. Natashy Oakley and Devin Brugman are Rif Care's newest investors. Brugman and Oakley felt like they shared a common mission with Rif —to celebrate, uplift, and improve the lives of women. Oakley initially reached out via an Instagram message to Emanuel asking to see if Rif was open to new investors. “That alignment really stood out. We’re both female-founded with all-female teams, which creates a strong sense of shared values and vision. I’ve been consistently impressed by Val and Rebecca’s passion and the thoughtfulness behind Rif. Their authenticity and commitment made it a natural decision to get involved,” they shared. “As a first step, we’re working closely with them to build out a diverse, thorough, and effective marketing plan tailored to their key markets. We’re also making some early suggestions on product development to support growth and differentiation.” Women on average are exposed to 168 harmful chemicals every day that can affect hormones and reproduction. Rif Care is one of the only period care brands utilizing hemp for period care, “Hemp is a super fiber that was one of the most utilized materials for thousands of years and then when it became illegal, its use became taboo and its availability became more limited. Hemp produces a high-performing fiber that’s super absorbent and comfortable. It doesn't need any pesticides to grow. It is naturally antibacterial, antimicrobial and grows with less water than cotton. Hemp is also an amazing fiber as a non-woven, which is its newest use that we brought to market. We also think there was an opportunity to make hemp less crunchy and more modern, and approachable to women,” shared Caputo and Emanuel. Rif carries organic hemp tampons, pads and leak-proof period underwear. Educating women is another big pillar in Rif’s mission from cycle education to understanding the ingredients in personal care products. “As women, we have to shop for food and beauty products with our health in mind and really know what every ingredient means. There's growing awareness of the toxins in personal care products. From heavy metals found in tampons to PFA forever chemicals in our underwear, women are learning how companies have taken shortcuts that make us sick and cause our hormones to get out of whack.
