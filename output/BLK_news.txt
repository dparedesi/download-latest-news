Title: Andreessen Horowitz Says Crypto Has Entered a ‘New Era’ of Real Utility
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/10/22/andreessen-horowitz-says-crypto-has-entered-a-new-era-of-real-utility

Crypto’s future is starting to look more like a global financial system and less like a speculative playground, according to Andreessen Horowitz. In its State of Crypto 2025 report, a16z analysts argue that the industry has entered a new era shaped by infrastructure upgrades, regulatory clarity and deeper ties with traditional finance. Among the most important trends for the coming year: stablecoin growth, real-world assets moving onchain, and new intersections with artificial intelligence (AI). Stablecoins, which enable fast and cheap dollar transfers, are seeing wide adoption from institutions like Visa, Citi and PayPal. Visa said it sees strong demand in volatile emerging markets and cross-border payments. According to a16z, stablecoins handled $46 trillion in transactions over the past year — more than double PayPal — and now rival major networks like ACH and Visa. They’re also becoming major U.S. Treasury holders, surpassing countries like South Korea and Germany. As regulatory efforts in the U.S. gain traction, stablecoins could strengthen the dollar’s global position. Legislation around market structure is expected to be a top priority in 2025, giving companies a clearer framework to launch products and onboard users. Institutional momentum is picking up too. BlackRock and JPMorgan are building crypto partnerships, while Morgan Stanley plans to offer crypto trading on E*TRADE starting at the beginning of 2025. Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for bitcoin BTC$110,333.30 and ethereum ETH$3,898.36 now hold over $175 billion combined, signaling a shift from fringe asset to portfolio staple. Meanwhile, a quiet infrastructure revolution is underway. Ethereum upgrades and the rise of Solana have pushed blockchain transaction speeds to over 3,400 per second — closing in on the scale of credit card networks. These technical improvements, along with new privacy tools like zero-knowledge proofs and preparations for quantum-resistant encryption, are making blockchains more usable and secure. Real-world assets such as U.S. Treasuries, commodities and equity instruments are beginning to move onchain, with $30 billion already tokenized. This shift could rewire how capital markets operate by creating more efficient settlement layers and round-the-clock liquidity. AI is also becoming part of the equation. Developers are exploring how crypto tools like decentralized infrastructure and smart contracts can check the growing concentration of power in big tech's hands. Though crypto has lost some engineering talent to AI startups, it's also pulling new entrants from adjacent industries. Finally, developers are starting to focus more on revenue-generating products. Projects brought in $18 billion last year, and about $4 billion of that flowed directly to tokenholders — hinting at a maturing business model that rewards users and investors alike. As user numbers reach up to 70 million, a16z expects consumer apps to drive the next wave of growth. The report paints a picture of crypto not as a trend but as a long-term platform — one that’s finally finding its footing in the mainstream economy.

Time Published: 2025-10-22T14:48:10Z
Full Content:
Jennie O\u0027Sullivan The jury in the trial of two men accused of the murder of a man whose skeletal remains were found five months after he was first reported missing, has retired to consider its verdicts. Luke Taylor, aged 28, formerly of Cherry Lawn, Blackrock, Cork, and 33-year-old Niall Long, formerly of St Michael's Close, Mahon, Cork, have both pleaded not guilty to the murder of Kieran Quilligan. The murder count which each man denies states that on a date unknown between 1 September 2023 and 29 January 2024, at an unknown location within the State in the District Court area of Cork City he did murder 47-year-old Kieran Quilligan contrary to Common Law. Before the jury began their deliberations this afternoon, Ms Justice Siobhán Lankford told the two women and 10 men that they are dealing with two seperate trials and the verdict in respect of one of the defendants could be different to the verdict on the other, if the jury so decided. Ms Justice Lankford said their verdicts had to be unaminous. She said there are three verdicts open to the jury in respect of each defendant. They can find him guilty of murder, not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter, or not guilty of murder. Mr Quilligan was first reported missing on 1 September 2023. His skeletal remains were found on scrub land near Midleton on 29 January 2024, almost five months later. © RTÉ 2025.

Title: APT price soars as BlackRock’s BUIDL fund expands to Aptos
URL: https://coinjournal.net/news/apt-price-soars-as-blackrocks-buidl-fund-expands-to-aptos/
Time Published: 2025-10-22T14:46:05Z
Full Content:
The APT price is showing renewed strength as Aptos gains major institutional backing from global giants like BlackRock and Jump Crypto. After dipping to a yearly low earlier this month, Aptos has staged an impressive comeback, fueled by real-world asset tokenisation and enterprise-grade innovation across its ecosystem. Aptos has outperformed a sluggish crypto market, gaining around 5% in the past 24 hours to trade near $3.32. This sharp rebound follows BlackRock’s expansion of its Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) to the Aptos blockchain, a move that has injected $500 million worth of tokenised Treasuries into the network. 🚨 $500M more of @BlackRock's BUIDL just landed on Aptos. This pushes Aptos back into the Top 3 in RWAs, with $1.2B+ tokenized assets on-chain. And now, we're #2 in BUIDL adoption. Institutions are choosing Aptos, the chain to move what matters. pic.twitter.com/vT3jfZYmPb — Aptos (@Aptos) October 21, 2025 The deployment of BUIDL has pushed Aptos into the top tier of real-world asset (RWA) blockchains, sitting just behind Ethereum and zkSync Era. Data shows that more than $1.2 billion in RWAs are now tokenised on Aptos, a milestone that marks growing trust from traditional finance. Notably, BlackRock’s involvement brings not only prestige but also liquidity and credibility to the network. In parallel, Jump Crypto has launched Shelby, a decentralised, high-performance storage layer developed in collaboration with Aptos Labs. Storage is the missing layer. Blockchains run fast. Oracles work. Messages move across chains. But without high performance storage, real execution stays centralized. We're building Shelby with @AptosLabs to fix that.https://t.co/VFtuFRQp4P — Jump Crypto 🔥💃🏻 (@jump_) October 21, 2025 Designed to rival traditional cloud providers such as AWS and Google Cloud, Shelby enables sub-second latency, low-cost reads and writes, and improved scalability. Its architecture reduces redundancy while maintaining high data durability through erasure coding. The new system could become a backbone for decentralised applications that require real-time data access and high-speed processing. By combining Aptos’s parallel execution engine and Move programming language with Shelby’s efficient data design, the two firms aim to create infrastructure suited for enterprise and AI-driven decentralised finance (DeFi). This blend of performance and programmability is helping Aptos carve a niche in a crowded Layer-1 field. As institutional adoption accelerates and on-chain liquidity grows, the Aptos price could continue to benefit from renewed investor confidence. While short-term volatility remains, the network’s long-term fundamentals appear stronger than ever — anchored by innovation, partnerships, and a clear path toward real-world integration. The Aptos price is currently testing resistance near $3.50 after rebounding from a recent low of $2.22. Technical indicators show mixed signals, with moving averages flashing multiple sell alerts, although oscillators remain neutral. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) hovers around 34, suggesting mild accumulation. If APT breaks above $3.50, it could extend gains toward $3.85. However, failure to maintain current momentum could see the token slip toward $3.00 or even retest its earlier lows. Analysts like Michaël van de Poppe have noted that APT remains at one of its lowest valuations in years, hinting at potential upside if broader market sentiment improves.

Title: Blockbuster $40b AI Investment Is Only 10% of What’s Coming (NVDA, MSFT, META, BLK)

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 AI giants including Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, and Oracle recently announced a $40 billion deal that will help them secure coveted computing capacity for artificial intelligence. The blockbuster data center deal is a big reason why Morgan Stanley estimates that Global AI infrastructure spending is projected to hit $400 billion this year. Some speculate that all of this AI dependency can be risky, however, because if AI stumbles, all major tech stocks could fall simultaneously. Previously, individual companies were affected by performance in their specific sectors, but now many will rise and fall together based on AI sentiment. It’s why so many have compared this moment to the dot-com boom of the late 1990s, where enthusiasm for a single technological trend drove valuations beyond reason. Douglas McIntyre: Lee, one of the things we’re seeing in the world of AI is these massive alliances, you know, where different companies form partnerships and everybody brings piece of their expertise to the thing and work together. It’s not always clear who gets what from whom and who put what in, but you’ve got one, you just, you got one that just came out. Lee Jackson: Boy, do I ever, I mean, when you get, okay, and I’m gonna have to, I’m gonna read these off to you, Doug. When you get BlackRock, who’s clearly has more dough than anybody in the world, Nvidia, Microsoft, and OpenAI to all chip in $40 billion to buy aligned data centers. That shows you that the demand for cloud computing and data center storage, and, and retrieval and all of that has got to be, they see it to be exponentially much, much bigger than we can see it right now. Or why would they go in and spend $40 billion to buy this? And I think it’s, I think it’s pretty provocative because it’s, it’s like all four major partners in the industry who have been very happy to just do circular financing is now, we have now deemed it to be that they’re gonna combine to have this capacity for, for cloud computing and, and all the above. But $40 billion is a big chunk of dough even for those kind of major players. And it’s interesting. Will we see more of this? Will we see other data center providers? And there’s big ones, you know, there’s super big ones and, you know, Digital Realty people like that. Will somebody go in and make a big play for them? Or somebody you know of that size and scope. I think it’ll be interesting to see if this expands and there’s more data center purchases, you know, as we head down the road. McIntyre: If you called me up tomorrow and said to me that Microsoft bought Duke Energy there’s, or Constellation, it’s, this is crazy enough now, so that you could actually see a consolidation based on an based on ownership. If I’ve got, if I’ve got the technology and you’ve got the infrastructure, maybe I should just buy you. Jackson: Absolutely. And I don’t think, you know, and as we’ve discussed, you know, you’re not gonna build any small scale nuclear reactors anytime soon. And the approval process, you know, could take forever. Although I’m sure they could help speed it up ’cause we’re gonna need it for the national power grid ’cause we’re gonna need it. But yeah, I think, I think that’s true. And you know, there’s big players like Digital and Equinix and people like that, you know, that have been in the business forever, you know, from, you know, startup, you know. In that industry. And it’s interesting to focus on, well, will they continue to build more or will people continue to consolidate that industry? Because again, the question is, is it getting away from itself as well? Are we building too many data centers? I don’t think so because the demand is just never ending. But boy, it, there’s gonna be a point, I think when, and, and we’ve had this discussion where data center usage and power usage is gonna, there, there’s gonna be an issue here at some point, and that’s why most of these people are trying to desperately to find a way. That’s why they’re building data centers in North Dakota and South Dakota because of the, the big, you know, oil fields up there, and that’s why they’re building them in Texas. That’s why they’re building them out in the Permian and out there. And so it’s like, okay, if we can’t bring the electricity to us, we’ll go to where the gas, the natural gas is, and we’ll build our own. McIntyre: It’s funny, CNBC did a, an article today and it’s, it’s, it’s based on a, a see your own shadow premise. Apparently, the people looking for data centers are shopping around the utilities. So if I’m gonna build a data center, I may call 10 utilities try to. What’s happening is the utilities are now getting confused about how many data centers there might be. Because if, if you call me and it’s just, I’m the one utility and you’re the one person who wants a data center, that’s easy to count, right? One guy called me about one data center, but if I’m the utility and ten data centers around and you say to me, “Do a forecast. I want you to forecast for me how many data centers we’re gonna have to support. It’s like, well, ten guys called me, but if I don’t get any of them? Or what if I get all 10? So there’s a capacity calculation problem that has the chance of me being that you’ll have overbuilding it. It could be that people have phone calls that they think, well, I’ll, I’ll build because I’m gonna get five of the ten. The town over does the same thing. There is a situation, scenario, as they say, where you could have overbuilding based on shadow demand, is they asked me, so it must be that they’ve picked me. Jackson: And the thing that will be interesting to see, if we do overbuild, which typically you know, has happened in the United States for, you name it, what do you do with empty data centers, with racks and racks and racks of servers> McIntyre: When that happens, we’ll just pull out the racks and turn ’em into huge barnyards. Listen, at least we know they have to be close to water for cooling. We know that they’ll get some electricity, so we need to keep the lights on for the cattle. So there’ll be water for the cattle ’cause they’ll be located, they’ll have water and we’ll have some electricity and we can use it. We can use them basically as a huge farm. Jackson: Well, I think this deal is either the beginning of the end or the end of the beginning. You know, I don’t know what it is for the data center wave and, and, and data center building and data center construction, but we’ll find that out soon enough.

Title: The M&A Curse of Warner Bros. Discovery | Analysis
URL: https://www.thewrap.com/the-ma-curse-of-warner-bros-discovery-analysis/
Time Published: 2025-10-22T13:00:00Z
Full Content:
Pro Available to WrapPRO members WBD is officially in play. Can CEO David Zaslav do right by his shareholders after three-plus years of holding a declining stock? Warner Bros. Discovery announced it was undergoing a “strategic review” on Tuesday after the company said it is fielding “unsolicited interest” from “multiple parties” for all or part of its business. Its stock popped 11% on the news. But mergers have generally not been kind to the company that started out as Warner Brothers in 1923, including what history will record as one of the worst mergers ever with AOL Time Warner, whose shareholders lost $2oo billion in the aftermath of that dot-com bubble marriage in the early aughts. That didn’t stop the Ellisons’ billions, which have actually made what would have otherwise been a ho-hum year for M&A in media and entertainment pretty interesting. Through their own new acquisition, Paramount, they set off a steeplechase for Warner Bros. Discovery — either as a whole entertainment conglomerate, or as two separated units in Warner Bros. and Discovery Global. That now begs the question of whether the Ellisons would take yet another crack at buying WBD, or maybe just the Warner Bros. studio and HBO, on a hot streak right now. Or do we see some new deep-pocketed buyers emerge? Paramount reportedly made a $20 a share bid for WBD that was spurned, and then two additional bids under $30 a share according to CNBC, leading to CEO David Zaslav‘s announcement: “After receiving interest from multiple parties, we have initiated a comprehensive review of strategic alternatives to identify the best path forward to unlock the full value of our assets.” But the constituency we aren’t reading too much about here is the WBD shareholders who are sitting on a stock at Tuesday’s close that is still 17% lower than when WBD first started trading on April 11, 2022, after Zaslav engineered his Discovery’s takeover of Warner. That is 17% lower, notably, even with the takeover talk bump to WBD stock from when Paramount’s interest first broke and then the 11% rise on Tuesday. For shareholders, that’s three-plus years of watching your stock go in the opposite direction of where it’s supposed to go. Big shareholders include Vanguard Group and BlackRock on the institutional side, and Condé Nast owners the Newhouse family and cable mogul John Malone on the individual side. (Malone inherited the Warner stock, a big bonus over the downward course where Discovery was headed.) The Ellisons seem suited to shake things up. It feels like their parachuting into Hollywood was all about that, with the bags of cash to make it happen. But now that the “For Sale” sign is officially up at WBD, you’d have to consider Netflix, Amazon, Apple, Comcast or maybe even a consortium of private equity or Saudi backers as potentially interested suitors. On Tuesday, Ted Sarandos left the door open to considering Warner, saying on the earnings call: “We focus on profitable growth and reinvesting in our business, both organically and through selective M&A,” Sarandos said, with an emphasis on selective M&A for effect. Zaslav brought in the big-gun investment bankers to assist with his review, Allen & Co., J.P. Morgan and Evercore. Let’s pause for a minute to consider the math: $12.54 — This was WBD’s closing price on Sept. 10, the day before Bloomberg broke the news that Paramount was preparing a bid. $16.17 — This was WBD’s closing price the next day, showing a 29% bump on a so-called takeover premium. Takeover offers in the media space have been attracting a 20% to 25% premium. If Paramount did indeed offer $20 per share offer, that represents a 59% premium from the $12.54 where WBD was languishing before the takeover news broke. But clearly Zaslav and team are thinking that WBD could see more upside from bringing in other potential buyers to boost a premium for the company. Circling back to those downtrodden WBD shareholders. Bank of America Securities on Tuesday placed a value of $30 per share on WBD ($26 for the Warner Bros. studio, which includes HBO, and $4 for the cable networks side, which includes CNN). So what if a buyer would come in with a $30 a share offer for the whole company? That would be a 48% premium to the current price, and 140% premium to the Sept. 10 closing price. Pretty enticing for a shareholder who’s held on for three years in a downward slide. Zaslav was schooled under the legendary General Electric CEO Jack Welch when he was starting out at NBC, so don’t underestimate his deal savvy, even though WBD shareholders are feeling like they got stuck with a dud.

Tech Companies Pushing Off Those Exits: Research firm CB Insights reported some interesting data last week as part of its State of Venture Q3’25 Report that shows that tech companies are in less of a rush to strike an exit. “The ability to raise at decacorn ($10 billion and above) valuations while staying private removes the pressure to go public for capital. Companies can now scale to a massive size, hire top talent through liquid secondary markets, and maintain founder control — all without the quarterly earnings pressure or regulatory burdens associated with going public,” CB Insights explains. Average time for tech startups to stay private rose from 12.2 years in 2015 to 15.9 years in 2025. See below. 2. AI Killing Jobs? Not if You Look at This Data: It seems like companies are increasingly bringing people on board who help embed AI into daily operations, but new data dispells the widespread notion that the technology is a job killer. The Economist cites work by Seyed Hosseini and Guy Lichtinger, both doctoral students at Harvard University who have been tracking companies that hired “generative-AI integrators.” The students used AI itself to go through 200 million job postings and found 130,000 such vacancies at 10,600 firms that they called “AI adopters.” See below for the upward trend. When you hear Libby Bush talk about her motivating drive over the years, one that has been rewarded with a senior executive role for partnerships at CAA, it’s hard not to think it came from her days on the soccer pitches and lacrosse fields of her youth outside Philadelphia. She ended up playing Division I lacrosse for the University of Richmond Spiders, a sport she’s still involved with near her home in Pacific Palisades. “I certainly didn’t get promoted because I waited for somebody to recognize my worth. It takes fighting for yourself, asking for things even though you might not feel qualified or you might not feel like you’ve hit the mark completely to deserve it. The worst people can say is no. “It’s a little bit of the fake it til you make it. I never worked for an agency. How did I have the right to start one? But I believed enough in myself, I was willing to take the risk and I was willing to hear the word no as many times as I needed to until I heard the word yes. Holding myself back and not doing it because I didn’t have the qualifications was just never a part of the trajectory for me.” Sure feels like the spark of a competitive athlete is still in there somewhere. Bush, 43, spoke to our TV business reporter Lucas Manfredi for last week’s installment of our Office With a View executive Q&A series about the importance of brands becoming an essential tool for creators to both finance and market their projects across platforms. Bush has been responsible for leading the CAA team behind collaborations between hit series like Netflix’s “Bridgerton” and Flonase and Apple TV+’s “Severance” and State Farm. She’s also worked closely on connecting brands directly with CAA clients through projects like Ariana Grande’s Swarovski ad campaign, the NBC competition series “On Brand With Jimmy Fallon” and Kerry Washington’s YouTube series “Street You Grew Up On.” Bush, whose career has taken her to the NBA, WNBA, Disney and to her own startup agency Tandem Entertainment that CAA later purchased, is aware how important it was to hone her own story if she was going to help creators and brands do the same. “One size does not fit all in this business. There’s a lot of options on how to financially get deals done and creatively tell great stories in entertainment and culture.” Ad Age this year put her on its list of Leading Women, an honor for which some commenters on LinkedIn called her a “badass.” Our favorite part of her interview with Lucas was this career advice: “I would also say I learned a lot about mentorship and mentoring. When you work in really big corporations and you start out young in your career in these big organizations, you realize really quickly that people will continue to grow in their careers and they may end up anywhere. “So to me, it was always about treating everybody — whether they were next to you, below you or above you — the same, and how important it is to collect relationships and nurture them. Your network becomes everything to you in your career. Understanding how to use it and protect it and nurture it is a really big lesson for me throughout those companies.” The PR Guy Who Says The AI Boom Is a Bust, Channels with Peter Kafka podcast What’s Your AI-dentity?

Today’s top news: DraftKings just made its most aggressive move yet outside of sports betting. And it wasn’t into casino, poker, or fantasy. It was into prediction markets. 📌 What Happened DraftKings announced it is acquiring Railbird Technologies, a CFTC-regulated prediction market exchange, and will use it to launch a standalone events trading app called DraftKings Predictions. Railbird comes with what Kalshi and others fought hard for - federal approval from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to let people trade real-money contracts on real-world outcomes. Now DraftKing’s 6M monthly users will get access to prediction markets (and its $15B company has a shiny new expansion path). DraftKings says the new app will launch “in the coming months” and initially cover non-sports markets - things like finance, pop culture, elections, entertainment, and news. Though sports are very likely to come later (especially in states where DraftKings is currently banned). 🗣️ What Are They Saying “We are excited about the additional opportunity that prediction markets could represent for our business. We believe that Railbird’s team and platform—combined with DraftKings’ scale, trusted brand, and proven expertise in mobile-first products—positions us to win in this incremental space.” - DraftKings CEO Jason Robins said in a statement to CNBC “DraftKings acquires prediction market firm Railbird As I shared last week prediction markets are the future for sports wagering Less than a week later you see $DKNG getting involved.” - Rippe, on X “$DKNG is acquiring CFTC-licensed predictions platform Railbird to launch “DraftKings Predictions” a marketplace for trading outcomes in finance, culture & entertainment. It’s a move to tap non-sports states like California & Texas in the coming months.” - Shay Boloor on X 🧠 Why It Matters If prediction markets needed any more validation, they got it here from DraftKings. They have simply become too big to ignore and are now fully crossing over into mainstream betting. There’s also a new battle brewing between two worlds: DraftKings brings three big advantages: They will be a force to be reckoned with in this space. A lot depends on timing here. Someone who is used to betting elections on Polymarket probably won’t switch to DraftKings. But - if DraftKings beats Polymarket to the US market with its new DraftKings Predictions app, it could absolutely steal that average user who knows what prediction markets are / Polymarket is, but doesn’t want to hassle with VPNs. And if DK sports prediction markets have the same liquidity that Kalshi has shown over the past few months, then they could steal significant market share in sports. The bull case is, the entrance of DraftKings into the prediction market sector grows the overall pie and drives weekly volumes even further up and to the right. The bear case - the sector is zero-sum for the near future and any DK share is taken from an existing leader. My gut is, the bull case will prevail for the near future.

Title: Dublin to host Michelin star ceremony – could Ireland be about to get a three-star restaurant?

The Michelin Guide annual ceremony for Britain and Ireland will land in Dublin for the first time in February next year. The selection of an Irish city for the ceremony on February 9th, following Glasgow in 2025, is not just about geography – it’s about signalling that Ireland’s culinary moment is now. At the event in Dublin’s Convention Centre, the Guide will unveil stars, Bibs Gourmands, Green Stars and special awards for “the most talented restaurant teams and chefs from Great Britain and Ireland”. The ceremony will also be livestreamed globally. La Rousse Foods, Musgrave’s premium food service brand, will be official partner. If past years are anything to go by, the Bibs and Green Stars will be teased or quietly announced before the main stars are revealed. In Ireland the speculation about awards is electric. Chapter One in Dublin under Mickael Viljanen and Ross Lewis is viewed as possibly being in line for a third Michelin star. It currently holds two. Liath in Blackrock, Co Dublin, with chef Damien Grey is widely tipped as one to watch – again, rumours suggest a push toward three stars. Dede in Baltimore, Co Cork, helmed by Ahmet Dede and managed by Maria Archer, is also in the conversation for top-tier elevation. For two-star upgrades, names to watch include Lady Anne at Mount Juliet Estate (chef John Kelly) and Adare Manor (chef Mike Tweedie), which is also gearing up to host the Ryder Cup in 2027. Dublin’s incomprehensibly overlooked spots are Library Street Café and Una Mas, both long considered deserving of a first star. The newer challengers – Lena and Comet – may well be poised to make their first splash. Outside Dublin, the Park Hotel Kenmare in Co Kerry under Bryan and Tara Meehan already holds two Michelin Keys for its hotel offering and is undergoing a significant expansion. The owners may well be holding off on chasing a Michelin star for their Landline restaurant, adorned with Seán Scully paintings, until after this upgrade is complete. In a more general sense, hosting the Michelin ceremony in Ireland is symbolic, speaking of recognition and rising ambitions. But hosting isn’t the same as winning. The kitchens still need to deliver. Between now and next February, a few questions are sure to keep buzzing around the Irish restaurant scene. Will Chapter One finally get its third star? Given its pedigree this is internationally accepted as overdue. Will Liath and Dede join the three-star club? It would be a big ask, but the talk is loud. And will there be any surprise entries? We should remember that newcomers often sneak in; we’ll be watching Lena and Comet closely.

Title: How Beyond Meat became the market's latest meme-stock darling

Love Business Insider? Log into Google and make us a preferred source. Was this email forwarded to you? Sign up now. Market musings It's 2019. You get out of an "Avengers: Endgame" screening and pop your earbuds in. You like this up-and-coming artist, Billie Eilish, who seems pretty promising. You fire up a new app called TikTok. You can't figure out how it's different from Vine, but everyone seems to be into it. You pop into a local eatery and order one of those new plant-based Beyond Meat burgers that everyone's talking about. The company is valued at $14 billion. It doesn't taste great, but you're told it's the future of food. Fast-forward to the present day. Beyond Meat is worth less than $1 billion, and was a penny stock until very recently. Sales are a fraction of what they were. No, this is not some dystopian reality. The fact is, the competition stacked up against Beyond, and demand for meat alternatives waned. But something has shifted in the stock this week. Shares surged 128% (to $1.47) on Monday, on trading that was roughly 70 times the average. It followed that up on Tuesday with a 146% increase (to $3.62) on even more volume. Then it soared another 65% on Wednesday, bringing the three-day move to more than 800%. What gives? Well, it turns out that a retail investor named Dimitri Semenikhin (screen name: Capybara Stocks) has been buying up all the Beyond shares he can find. He says he now owns about 4% of the company's outstanding stock, and he posted about it on Reddit. Given the fact that Beyond already carried the natural characteristics of a meme stock — a nostalgic brand heavily shorted by institutions — the post was like catnip to Semenikhin's fellow retail traders. Business Insider's Sam O'Brient tracked down Semenikhin — who is based in Dubai — on Monday, while Beyond stock was ripping. He wanted to find out what was motivating him. Why take such a big position in a downtrodden penny stock down more than 80% year to date? Semenikhin provided some fundamental reasons. Key among them was the completion of a convertible note exchange, which he says lessens its previously high risk of bankruptcy and greatly strengthens its balance sheet. He said this was incorrectly viewed by some as a negative. "At the current price that I bought in, the pricing was just way too low for what was happening," he told BI. In a separate interview on Tuesday, he said that he sees the stock soaring another 66% from current levels, to around $6 per share. Semenikhin's undervaluation thesis may very well be true. After all, Beyond on Tuesday announced a collaboration with Walmart that — when combined with the lingering retail rocket fuel, and the stock's addition to a meme-stock ETF — sent shares surging more than 100% for a second straight day. But there's also no denying that Semenikhin is trying to emulate the playbook of Roaring Kitty, the GameStop-obsessed retail investor who was eventually immortalized in his very own movie. It's also clear he's having a similar effect, with Monday's price surge in Beyond defying fundamental logic. There's the regular YouTube posting. There's the Reddit activity (although his original post is now deleted). And there's the unrepentant desire to drive a short squeeze. Will Semenikhin go full Roaring Kitty and start wearing a signature headband? That remains to be seen. But the similarities run deep, and BI will continue to check in with him for updates. Look at that V-shaped bounce! Thanks a lot, Dimitri Semenikhin (and Walmart). Beyond Meat stock is now down just 4% in 2025, compared to the 86% loss through last Thursday's close. The rally has coincided with unprecedented options-trading volume for the stock, and as daily shares traded broke the 1 billion threshold for two straight sessions. The title of this chart from BlackRock Investment Institute says it all: earnings expectations for companies in the S&P 500 are reaccelerating. This is reflected by the upward slope of the orange line, which shows the 12-month change in profit forecasts. This aligns with the guidance we've gotten so far from industry bellwethers during the third-quarter reporting season. On Tuesday alone, General Motors, GE, Lockheed Martin, and RTX raised future earnings forecasts. Culture confidential Business Insider's Will Edwards spotlights a hot trend dominating Wall Street and the finance industry. They make you feel like you're walking on a cloud. You can wear them with a suit or with jeans. They'll earn you street cred with finance bros. The catch? They're $1,100. Zegna's Triple Stitch shoes have unofficially become Wall Street's hottest footwear, exploding in popularity in recent years amid the quiet luxury movement. Apple CEO Tim Cook sports them. CNBC host Andrew Ross Sorkin told BI he wears them too, and that he sees them everywhere. The Wall Street Journal proclaimed a few years back that they're the most-worn shoes on private jets. But they're not only popular with the uber-rich. Sales associates at multiple Zegna locations in Manhattan said that they have a wide age range of financial industry clients. Are they really worth the hype? Eager to see for myself, I went to the brand's global store on 57th Street in NYC to try on a pair. My review, in short? They're absolutely worth the money. If you're the type of person who is OK with dropping a rent payment on some sneakers, at least. I didn't love their plain look initially, but how they feel on your feet completely changes your perception of them. I'm usually a size 11.5, but the folks at the store said they recommend going a half-size up. They come in 30 different color options — I went with a black and white scheme. They were easily the most comfortable pair of shoes I'd ever worn. After being made a convert, I decided to head out and try to spot a pair of them in the wild. Given that it was rainy, I was doubtful I'd find anyone. But within minutes, as I approached Park Avenue, there was a pair walking right at me. A visitor from Charleston, South Carolina, said he had his custom-made last year and picked up three pairs. "I love them," he said, before asking: "Are you gonna buy a pair?" I'll have to save up first, I told him. Do you own a pair of Zegnas or another quiet luxury item you love?

Title: Why Some Bitcoin Whales Are Converting Their BTC Into Spot ETF Shares: Bloomberg

Full Content:
Some large bitcoin holders are moving coins into spot exchange-traded funds through in-kind creations, converting off-platform BTC into brokerage-account assets they can borrow against or include in estate plans, Bloomberg reported Tuesday. The mechanics rest on a summer policy shift. On July 29, 2025, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced the decision to approve orders allowing in-kind creations and redemptions for crypto-asset exchange-traded product (ETP) shares, a policy which covers spot bitcoin exchange traded funds (ETFs). The agency called the change a break from earlier cash-only approvals for spot bitcoin and ether and an alignment with long-standing practice for commodity ETPs. In practice, the SEC said authorized participants can deliver or receive the underlying asset, rather than cash, when creating or redeeming ETP shares. SEC Chair Paul Atkins said the shift would make products “less costly and more efficient,” while Trading and Markets Director Jamie Selway called it an “important development” that adds flexibility for issuers and investors. Against that backdrop, Bloomberg reported that some whales are handing BTC to ETFs and receiving fund shares without selling, a structure the outlet noted is generally tax-neutral because no sale is recorded. The exposure stays the same, but it appears in a brokerage account where it can be pledged as collateral or folded into estate planning, Bloomberg said. Activity is already visible, Bloomberg reported. BlackRock has facilitated more than $3 billion of such conversions, its head of digital assets Robbie Mitchnick said. Bitwise told Bloomberg it is getting daily inquiries from clients who want holdings reflected on wealth platforms. Galaxy has processed a handful of transactions, Bloomberg added, citing Michael Harvey. Some clients shift only a slice of holdings; a “subset” consolidates entirely because “it’s the easiest way” to hold going forward, Mitchnick told Bloomberg. Bitwise President Teddy Fusaro said there are “benefits of having things in the traditional financial system,” including how clients are serviced by private banks. Banks already play a limited role in facilitating these trades — particularly on creations — even as only non-bank broker-dealers can currently complete the full process, Bloomberg added. Neither BlackRock, Bitwise nor Galaxy immediately responded to CoinDesk's request for comment.

Title: Bitcoin ETFs record $477M in inflows after four days of outflows
URL: https://coinjournal.net/news/bitcoin-etfs-record-477m-in-inflows-after-four-days-of-outflows/

Spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US registered strong inflows on Tuesday, reversing the previous week’s outflow trend. According to data from Farside Investors, total daily net inflows reached $477.2 million, signalling renewed investor confidence following a period of volatility in the crypto market. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) led the inflows with $210.9 million, while the Ark & 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) followed with $162.8 million. Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) also recorded $34.15 million in new investments. The inflows come after several consecutive sessions of net withdrawals across spot crypto ETFs, which collectively lost over $1 billion in recent days as persistent trade tensions between the US and China weighed on investor sentiment. Despite the rebound in inflows, overall trading activity remained elevated. Bitcoin ETFs posted $7.41 billion in total trade volume on Tuesday. Throughout October, daily trading volumes have fluctuated between $5 billion and $9.78 billion — significantly higher than the $2 billion to $4 billion range seen in September. Spot Ethereum ETFs also saw renewed investor participation. On Tuesday, the funds collectively attracted $141.6 million in net inflows, according to Farside data. Fidelity’s FETH accounted for the largest portion at $59 million, while additional inflows came from funds operated by BlackRock, Grayscale, and VanEck. The combined rebound across Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs suggests that institutional appetite for crypto exposure remains strong despite recent price corrections. At the time of writing on Wednesday, Bitcoin (BTC) was trading around $108,500, stabilising after facing resistance the previous day. The cryptocurrency found support near the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $106,453, drawn from its April low of $74,508 to its record high of $126,199. BTC rebounded nearly 4% by Monday but later slipped 2% on Tuesday after being rejected from the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $113,606. If the downward momentum continues, Bitcoin could revisit support near $106,453. A decisive close below this level may open the door for further declines toward the October 10 low of $102,000. Ethereum (ETH) has also shown signs of weakness, extending its recent correction. After retreating by more than 4% last week from resistance at $4,232, the cryptocurrency continued to slide by another 3% through Tuesday. ETH was trading around $3,847 on Wednesday. Should the downward trend persist, Ethereum may test the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $3,593, which aligns closely with the 200-day EMA — a key area that could determine whether the broader trend remains intact or shifts further bearish.

Title: Reimagined 1970s three-bed apartment in the heart of Ballsbridge for €800,000

One of Dublin 4’s most sought after addresses, Pembroke Road, is a short stroll to cafes and restaurants on Baggot Street Upper and a short walk up the two bridges in either direction on the Grand Canal will take you to local Dart and Luas stops. A 15-minute stroll will have you in the centre of St Stephen’s Green, the Aviva Stadium for rugby internationals and the villages of Ranelagh, Donnybrook and Sandymount, all of which have a great selection of pubs and restaurants. Number 75 Pembroke Road is set well back from the road itself. It originally had an office block to one side, which was replaced in the 1970s with a set of apartments, though is accessed through the original period doorway. Located just off the junction triangle of Northumberland, Lansdowne and Pembroke Roads, it’s as smack bang in the centre of Ballsbridge as you can get. Sharing its site with 30 other units, number 21 Pembroke Court is a second-floor dual aspect apartment that has just been released to the market through estate agent Owen Reilly. It has three bedrooms and a generous 97sq m (1,044sq ft) of floor space that has undergone a recent transformation since its owner purchased the unit in early 2021, for €525,000, according to the Property Price Register. It’s a smashing renovation of a 1970s unit that had little in the way of features until its owners gave it a stylish upgrade: “It was easy to see its potential, even though nothing had been done since the 1970s,” says its owner, adding “you don’t always get the luxury of all-square rooms, with proper windows that overlook a garden, but that, and the location made us buy”. With the help of Belgradian architectural duo Tihomir Dicic and Iva Njunic, the entire space has been reimagined to a superb, spacious three-bedroom contemporary apartment in the heart of one of the most desirable addresses in Dublin. By removing small hallways, the entire unit was opened up to give a lovely internal flow with the benefit of lots of light from large windows, all of which have been replaced with more energy-efficient aluclad units. When the walls were being insulated and upgraded, builders discovered the original brick walls of the period property next door. With advice from the architects that it could be exposed, and though it took “lots of cleaning and sealing” it is now a standout feature in the apartment, which owners have highlighted with the use of smart LED lights in an overhead shadow gap. In fact, thoughtful lighting – as 1970s ceilings are rarely high – was one of the many considerations when this unit was being refurbished. Central to the living space – off the dining and kitchen area – is a modular unit the family sourced from Nordic Elements in Blackrock, which sits so well around the television that you would think it was custom made for the room. Solid oak floors run through the C1-rated apartment, which has a streamlined kitchen with Bosch appliances and the focus on storage at design stage, allows the whole place to be streamlined and clutter free – despite this being home to a family with young children. Its three bedrooms comprise of two doubles and a single, and the family who live here say they were amazed at how the architects managed to rearrange the space to accommodate an en suite and so much storage in their home. Even the bathrooms are luxuriously subtle in a pared back kind of way, with focus on storage and illuminating soft tones from the wood. The owners, who are moving due to a growing family, have loved their time here – especially the garden out front where their children play – and say they live a mostly car-free life due to the location. This unit shows what a 1970s apartment can become with a bit of thought, and is now seeking €800,000 through Owen Reilly.

Share this article Bitcoin whales executed around $3 billion in ETF trades through BlackRock’s $IBIT, a spot Bitcoin ETF, using portfolio trade mechanisms that offer significant portfolio benefits, Bloomberg reported today. The trades allow large Bitcoin holders to convert their holdings directly into ETF shares through custom creation processes. BlackRock has been facilitating these in-kind creations for $IBIT, enabling Bitcoin whales to seamlessly integrate their holdings into traditional finance portfolios. The structure mirrors portfolio trades commonly used in bond markets, where assets are exchanged directly rather than through cash transactions. The portfolio trade mechanism provides Bitcoin whales with benefits including enhanced liquidity and tax efficiencies. These custom ETF creation methods have gained traction in crypto markets as institutional investors seek regulated investment vehicles for their digital asset holdings. BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF has seen heightened institutional interest as traditional finance firms adapt to cryptocurrency integrations through ETF structures. The asset management giant has been expanding its crypto offerings in response to evolving investor demands for regulated Bitcoin exposure. Sign in to your account Don’t have an account?

PHOTO: GIC Published Oct 22, 2025, 08:44 AM Updated Oct 22, 2025, 05:57 PM London – Deep-pocketed sovereign wealth funds are helping drive a resurgence in dealmaking that has taken global merger and acquisition (M&A) volumes past US$3.5 trillion (S$4.5 trillion) in 2025. The M&A volume is now up 34 per cent this year, putting 2025 on track to be the best year since 2021, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. More than US$1.3 trillion in transactions were recorded in the third quarter, driven by a few mega deals. State-backed funds from the Middle East and Asia, including Singapore, provided firepower for some of 2025’s biggest transactions. Blackstone and TPG agreed on Oct 21 to acquire medical-device maker Hologic for as much as US$18.3 billion including debt, with Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (Adia) and Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC taking minority stakes. Last week, BlackRock teamed up with Singapore’s investment company Temasek and MGX, an artificial intelligence investment firm set up by Abu Dhabi’s Mubadala Investment, on a US$40 billion deal for Aligned Data Centres. US$40 billion deal for Aligned Data Centres The week before, Carlyle Group partnered with Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) to buy control of BASF’s coatings business in a deal valuing the unit at €7.7 billion (S$11.6 billion). It was only in September that Saudi Arabia’s sovereign fund agreed to take video-game maker Electronic Arts private in a US$55 billion leveraged buyout – the biggest ever. Sovereign wealth funds have been building out their internal deal teams as they seek to do more direct investments, giving them a chance to profit without having to pay fees to Wall Street. They are among the biggest backers of private equity funds, and have squeezed out concessions that force the buyout firms to give them opportunities to invest alongside them in return for the cash they provide. The funds have been particularly active in tech. In August, private equity giant Thoma Bravo got backing from Adia for its roughly US$12 billion acquisition of human-resource software provider Dayforce. Abu Dhabi’s state-backed MGX has invested in OpenAI at a US$500 billion valuation. It has also backed Mr Elon Musk’s xAI and plans to contribute to US President Donald Trump’s Stargate venture. GIC and QIA have put money into rival AI start-up Anthropic. Rainmakers at the top investment banks said they expect the flurry of takeovers to continue. Goldman Sachs Group is predicting a major ramp-up in dealmaking towards the end of 2025, with a chance that 2026 will be a record year for M&A. Sovereign investors are on the hunt for more deals. Mubadala’s asset management arm is exploring an acquisition of Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings, the billboard operator with a market value of around US$930 million. And they are looking beyond takeovers, with the Qatari sovereign fund joining a more than US$2 billion fundraising for Hollywood superagent Ari Emanuel’s new company, alongside other investors like Apollo Global Management and Ares Management Corporation.

Title: Trump rebukes “young lady” reporter questioning Argentina bailout as farmers rips his beef deal
URL: https://www.dailydot.com/viral-politics/trump-backlash-beef-trade-deal-argentina/
Time Published: 2025-10-21T18:00:00Z
Full Content:
Rachel Kiley President Donald Trump is facing renewed backlash for his support of Argentina following a tone deaf comment he made about a potential beef trade deal with the country. Trump has been publicly mulling over the possibility of beginning to import beef from Argentina as a way to bring down prices at U.S. grocery stores. “If we buy some beef now—I’m not talking about that much—from Argentina, it would help Argentina, which we consider a very good country, a very good ally,” he said over the weekend. No deal has officially been made as of yet, but even the idea of it is causing an uproar among farmers who already feel betrayed and misled by the allegedly “America First” president. A reporter recently questioned Trump about this backlash, asking, “What do you have to say to U.S. farmers who feel that the deal is benefiting Argentina more than it does them—” “Look, Argentina’s fighting for its life, young lady,” he said, cutting her off. “You don’t know anything about it. They’re fighting for their life.” He went on to claim that “nothing’s benefiting Argentina” and that he wants to “help them survive in a free world,” before letting his true motivation slip. “I happen to like the president of Argentina,” he said. “I think he’s trying to do the best he can. But don’t make it sound like they’re doing great. They’re dying, alright? They’re dying.” The reporter’s identity could not immediately be confirmed. Q: What do you have to say to farmers who feel that the deal is benefitting Argentina more than it is them?TRUMP: Look, Argentina is fighting for its life, young lady. You don’t know anything about it. You understand what that means? They are dying pic.twitter.com/1DMyaHtcTR Trade wars have led to China, previously the largest buyer of U.S. soybeans, halting its purchases. Instead, they’re now getting soybeans from Brazil and Argentina. Adding insult to injury, the Trump administration has authorized a $20 billion currency swap for Argentina while U.S. farmers continue to struggle. And Trump himself has repeatedly made it clear that this help is motivated by his ideological allyship with Argentina’s president, Javier Milei. “Just helping a great philosophy take over a great country,” he recently said, while warning U.S. financial support for the country would drop if Argentinian politics shift left. Putting this relationship and Argentina’s economy above struggling Americans has angered some farmers, with many worrying that creating a beef deal with Argentina will only exacerbate an already bad situation for rural Americans. “President Trump’s plan to buy beef from Argentina is a betrayal of the American rancher,” Farm Action’s Senior Director of Programs, Christian Lovell, said in a press release. “The U.S. beef industry is dominated by four major meatpackers that control roughly 85% of the market. This consolidation allows them to suppress prices paid to ranchers while keeping consumer prices high. Importing more beef into this rigged system will not lower costs for families or restore fair markets for producers.” As frustrated as farmers may be, there’s been a fair amount of frustration aimed at them from other Americans, as well, considering many of them voted for him despite being warned that it would hurt the economy and their own bottom line. Still, that doesn’t mean people are keen on Trump throwing money at Argentina while gutting American programs—or that anyone was impressed by his condescending response to the reporter who actually asked him about it. The tone of “young lady” here then calling the reporter stupid is quite the combo https://t.co/dC6GDoDXts it’s quite funny that argentina’s current situation is a direct result of Milei’s policy. Farmers: We’re struggling. Trump: Okay, but have you tried being Argentina?MAGA farmers voted for the guy who bankrupted casinos, and they’re shocked he’s bankrupting them too. https://t.co/4Rw1LVBB8c I think the media should be doing a better job of explaining that Argentina is “fighting for it’s life” because they followed right wing policies which caused their economy to collapse. https://t.co/g2sxwYlaKY Why would Trump buy beef from Argentina while US farmers struggle?Maybe it’s because the Trump-connected fund managers at BlackRock, Fidelity and Pimco, and his mega-wealthy friends are heavily invested in Argentina.Always follow the money and you’ll find Trump’s corruption. https://t.co/4SM5nFaP4q Just found out that the first A in MAGA stands for Argentina.

October 21, 2025 • 15:00 UTC Bitcoin’s resilience, following the October 10 market crash, which wiped out $19B in leveraged positions and more than $450B in market cap, hints at a coming bull run. According to analysts at TD Cowen, Bitcoin could reach $141K by December if the asset regains its lost momentum. Following the brutal market crash, Bitcoin lost 10% in a matter of hours and dipped below $105K over the course of a week. A $141K prediction is more than feasible given Bitcoin’s resilience to such a devastating hit, and thanks to Bitcoin Hyper’s ($HYPER) presale, currently at $24.4M. As Bitcoin’s Layer 2 Solution, Hyper aims to enhance the Bitcoin network by making it faster, cheaper, more performant, and more scalable, thereby accommodating institutional investors who require high throughput and near-instant finality. Learn how to buy $HYPER right here. October 21, 2025 • 14:00 UTC Global investment management firm VanEck recently filed an application with the SEC for an ETF that tracks the price of Lido Staked $ETH ($stETH). If approved, it would be the first of its kind in the US. The firm also stated in a blog post that its ETF would give institutional investors ‘a compliant, tax-efficient way to gain Ethereum staking exposure within a regulated investment structure.’ While ETFs, such as those proposed by VanEck, offer investors a way to profit from crypto without owning the asset directly, others prefer to hold their investment directly. These investors, however, understand the challenge of finding promising assets to buy, especially if they’re in the market for the best meme coins. This is where Snorter Token ($SNORT) comes in with its proposed Snorter Bot. When launched, it’ll be a Telegram-based crypto trading bot that facilitates features such as sniping, copying trades, and managing wallets. Find out more about Snorter Token here. October 21, 2025 • 13:00 UTC Tom Lee’s BitMine Immersion continued with its Ethereum ($ETH) buying spree as the second-largest crypto’s price slid over the past few days. The world’s top Ethereum corporate treasury bought an additional 203,826 $ETH yesterday, which brought its total holdings to 3,236,014 $ETH. Lee said in a statement yesterday that with the expected Ethereum Supercycle, the currently low price of the coin represents an attractive risk/reward.’ Like Lee, other crypto traders are looking for alternative digital assets that are promising yet reasonably priced, such as Maxi Doge ($MAXI). The project aims to position $MAXI as one of the market’s best meme coins and dethrone its distant cousin Doge. To date, the $MAXI presale has raised over $3.7M, as it continues to attract fellow degens to the fold. Get the full details in ‘What is Maxi Doge?’ October 21, 2025 • 12:00 UTC Strategy (MSTR), the largest corporate to hold Bitcoin, recently purchased 168 $BTC at an average price of $112,051, according to a filing on Monday. The recent purchase brings up strategy’s total $BTC holdings to 640,418 (worth $71B), with an overall average purchase price of $74,010. $BTC prices have been on a rollercoaster since the market crash on October 10th. The OG crypto rebounded to $111K on Monday after falling to as low as $103,500, helping MSTR shares climb by 3% in pre-market trading, just below $300 per share. While institutional giants like Strategy continue to expand their $BTC reserves, retail investors remain cautious amid market volatility, redirecting capital toward promising presale opportunities with strong upside potential. One such rising contender is Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) — a Layer-2 scalability solution that employs Solana Virtual Machine to bring lightning-fast transactions and cross-chain operability to Bitcoin’s Layer 1. Check out our expert $HYPER price prediction here. October 21, 2025 • 10:47 UTC Binance founder Changpeng Zhao believes that the crypto captain has what it takes to flip gold’s market cap, although it might take some time. Currently, gold is the world’s largest asset, but that is likely to change soon, as the $BTC price soars over the coming cycles. Currently ranked eighth, $BTC has a market cap of $2.2T. CZ’s post also serves as a reminder that the long-term crypto projection looks strong, despite brief corrections. This is further evident from Bitcoin Hyper’s sizzling hot presale, ready to smash through $25M. The project is building a layer-2 solution for Bitcoin, bringing more speed and programmability to the network. Could $HYPER be the next meme coin to explode? Read our Bitcoin Hyper price prediction to find out. October 21, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Elon Musk reignites meme coin manis with his new viral post ‘Flōki is back on the job as 𝕏 CEO!’ His post sent $FLOKI soaring over 20% within hours, causing the token to climb from $0.00006689 to $0.00007456. $FLOKI’s derivatives volume spiked by 663% and open interest rose by 165%, all indicating strong retail speculation surrounding the asset. $FLOKI did not soar alone; Musk’s post helped the entire meme coin market cap to rise by 5.8% to $55.2B, once again highlighting his unmatched influence on dog-themed tokens. FLOKI’s official X account declared it the ‘#1 trending token on CxoinGecko,’ branding itself as ‘Elon’s dog.’ With $FLOKI riding Musk’s viral wave, the newest contender in the block is quietly stealing the spotlight – Maxi Doge ($MAXI). A meme token built on a body-building trading doge that represents gym pumps, raw strength, and the grind of the bull market. Beyond the high-octane meme appeal, the project is already building a loyal community united by its bold ‘crush the charts’ motto. Check out our in-depth $MAXI price prediction here. October 21, 2025 • 10:00 UTC BlackRock just launched its iShares Bitcoin ETP (IB1T) on the London Stock Exchange with the starting price of $11.10. As the official press release states, the goal is to expose ‘retail investors (i) with specific knowledge and/or experience of investing in similar products’ to Bitcoin and other digital assets in a regulated ecosystem. BlackRock’s IB1T is now available in 12 registered locations, including Austria, Spain, Portugal, UK, and Germany. The news is bullish for Bitcoin and could catalyze its Q4 run once $BTC breaks the $120K resistance point again. When that happens, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) may also see visible boost, although the presale is already in full bull mode. As Bitcoin’s Layer 2, promising a faster, cheaper, and more scalable Bitcoin ecosystem, Bitcoin Hyper already raised $24.4M in presale and it targets a Q1 2026 release date if the market is favorable.

Title: Bitcoin ETFs record fourth consecutive day of outflows
URL: https://coinjournal.net/news/bitcoin-etfs-record-fourth-consecutive-day-of-outflows/
Time Published: 2025-10-21T08:16:05Z
Full Content:
Bitcoin ETFs post $40.5 million outflow, fourth straight day of losses. Bitcoin falls nearly 3% to $108,112 as crypto sentiment weakens. BlackRock launches Bitcoin ETP in London amid market turbulence. US spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw $40.4 million in net outflows on Monday, marking their fourth straight day of negative flows, according to data from Farside Investors. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) was the only spot Bitcoin ETF to register outflows during the session, with $100.7 million exiting the fund. The losses were partly offset by inflows into five other ETFs managed by Fidelity, Grayscale, Bitwise, VanEck, and Invesco. The latest outflow follows Friday’s $366.6 million and Thursday’s $536.4 million withdrawals, extending a streak of negative sentiment that has persisted across digital asset funds since last week. Meanwhile, spot Ethereum ETFs also recorded continued weakness, with $145.7 million in net outflows on Monday — their third consecutive day of redemptions. Bitcoin fell sharply on Tuesday, reversing its weekend rebound as cryptocurrencies lagged behind other risk assets that benefited from easing US-China trade tensions. The world’s largest cryptocurrency dropped nearly 3% to $108,112.30, struggling to maintain the $110,000 level after a volatile start to October that erased roughly $500 billion in total crypto market capitalisation. Traders cited the lingering impact of the early-October flash crash — which triggered widespread liquidations and heightened risk aversion — as a key reason for the muted recovery. Market participants appeared hesitant to re-enter positions amid ongoing volatility and renewed concerns over ETF outflows. Optimism surrounding “Uptober,” a term describing the crypto market’s historical tendency to perform strongly in October, has faded rapidly. Bitcoin is now down more than 2% for the month, underscoring the loss of bullish momentum. The broader crypto market mirrored Bitcoin’s slide, with most major altcoins trading lower. Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation, fell 5.3% to $3,859.65, slipping below the key $4,000 threshold. XRP declined 2.2% to $2.4145, showing little reaction to the announcement of a new treasury backed by issuer Ripple Labs. Binance’s BNB token dropped 5.7%, while Cardano and Solana shed between 4% and 6%. Among memecoins, Dogecoin fell 4.3%, and $TRUMP lost 3.1%, reflecting a broad-based retreat across the digital asset space. Amid the downturn, BlackRock announced the launch of a new Bitcoin-linked exchange-traded product (ETP) in the United Kingdom, following the Financial Conduct Authority’s (FCA) decision to relax restrictions on crypto-based investment vehicles. The iShares Bitcoin ETP, listed on the London Stock Exchange on Monday, is structured as a Bitcoin-linked security that allows investors to purchase fractional units of Bitcoin through traditional brokerage accounts. The product is designed to closely track BTC prices while operating within a regulated investment framework. According to The Sunday Times, the entry price for the product will allow investors to buy fractions of Bitcoin for about $11 per unit, providing retail investors with exposure to the digital asset without direct ownership or the need to trade on crypto exchanges. BlackRock remains one of the most successful issuers of Bitcoin-linked products, with its US-listed iShares Bitcoin ETF holding more than $85 billion in net assets, according to SoSoValue data.

Title: $2B to flow into BlackRock’s UK Bitcoin ETF: How UK traders could recycle into IBIT

IBIT wrapper launch in the UK opens a market that could funnel between $1.5 billion and $2 billion into the fund over time. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) began trading in the UK on Oct. 20, opening a market that could funnel between $1.5 billion and $2 billion into the fund over time as UK retail investors gain regulated access to Bitcoin (BTC) exposure. The launch capitalizes on the Financial Conduct Authority’s (FCA) recent reversal of its ban on crypto-based exchange-traded products (ETPs). BlackRock’s US Bitcoin ETF, which launched two years ago and has nearly $65 billion in lifetime inflows, now offers British investors entry at approximately $11 per unit. This is a fraction of Bitcoin’s current $110,365 price. BlackRock reported $17 billion in net inflows to its digital asset products during the third quarter alone, part of $205 billion in total net inflows as the firm crossed $13 trillion in assets under management. The UK crypto market holds an estimated £13.3 billion across 7 million investors, per FCA data from March 2025. An IG report from early October projected the market could expand 20% following the FCA’s policy shift, translating to £2.4 billion to £3.2 billion in new capital, or roughly $3.2 billion to $4.3 billion. Bitcoin products have captured 60.6% of crypto investment flows globally, according to CoinShares’ latest report. Applied to UK projections, Bitcoin-focused vehicles could draw $1.93 billion to $2.6 billion. IBIT’s dominance in the US market, where it commands 75.5% of all Bitcoin ETF inflows since launch, suggests the fund could secure $1.5 billion to $2 billion from British investors. The fund’s structure removes traditional barriers that kept mainstream investors on the sidelines. Rather than navigating crypto exchanges, managing private keys, or purchasing entire coins, investors buy regulated shares through familiar brokerage accounts. The low entry threshold, roughly $11 per unit, democratizes access to an asset that trades above $100,000. BlackRock’s survey data supports aggressive growth projections. The firm expects a 21$ increase in UK adults investing in crypto for the first time over the next 12 months, with Britain ranking third in European crypto investment growth. The company predicts 4 million Bitcoin investors in the UK by year-end. Interest concentrates among younger demographics. IG’s research found 50% of 18-24-year-olds and 49% of 25-34-year-olds would consider investing in crypto via exchange-traded notes. Additionally, 32%of prospective investors cite regulatory oversight and safety as primary motivations, while 19% value the ability to hold crypto within tax-efficient Individual Savings Accounts and Self-Invested Personal Pensions. Bitcoin’s fixed supply of 21 million coins, with 95% already mined, creates scarcity dynamics that amplify demand pressures. BTC’s price grew 120% last year, and is up by nearly 20% in 2025, driven partly by President Donald Trump’s pro-crypto stance following his return to the White House. The UK government outlined plans last month for a comprehensive crypto-asset regulatory regime overseen by the FCA, positioning Britain to compete with jurisdictions that moved faster on digital asset frameworks. BlackRock’s launch transforms that regulatory shift into accessible products for millions of retail investors who previously faced exclusion or complexity barriers.

Title: Ethereum Whale BitMine Buys 203,800 ETH – Now Holds 2.7% Of Circulating Supply

Time Published: 2025-10-21T07:00:44Z
Full Content:
Ethereum (ETH) treasury firm BitMine Immersion Technologies today announced that it had bought another 203,800 ETH last week. Following its latest purchase, the firm’s total ETH holdings now stand 3.24 million tokens. According to a press release issued earlier today, BitMine Immersion Technologies, a leading Ethereum treasury firm has further increased its ETH holdings. The firm added another 203,800 ETH over the last week, worth approximately $820 million. Last week’s purchase has increased BitMine’s total ETH holdings to 3.24 million ETH, representing roughly 2.7% of the active circulating supply. In addition, the company holds 192 Bitcoin (BTC) and $219 in cash. The firm has $1.34 billion in combined crypto and cash holdings. BitMine’s frequent ETH purchases have propelled it as the leading public company in terms of ETH held on its balance sheet. Earlier this month, the firm had reported that its total ETH holdings had surpassed 3 million tokens. Commenting, Tom Lee, Chairman of BitMine said: The crypto market saw one of its largest deleveraging events ever last week and this put downward pressure on ETH prices. Open interest for ETH sits at the same levels as seen on June 30th of this year. Given the expected Supercycle for ethereum, this price dislocation represents an attractive risk/reward. We acquired 203,826 ETH tokens over the past week pushing our ETH holdings to 3.24 million, or 2.7% of the supply of ETH. We are now more than halfway towards our initial pursuit of the ‘alchemy of 5%’ of ETH. Lee added that he sees Ethereum as a “truly neutral” blockchain which is likely to witness growing institutional adoption. He added that BitMine remains committed to accumulating 5% of Ethereum’s total circulating supply. Following today’s announcement, the NYSE-listed firm’s stock BMNR surged an impressive 7.76%, trading at $53.72 at the time of writing. The stock is up an astonishing 640.87% over the past six months. As institutional adoption of Ethereum grows, analysts are predicting new all-time highs (ATH) for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. According to crypto analyst HAMED_AZ, ETH can surge to $6,400 on the back of a new bullish wave. Recent trends show that some institutional investors are even replacing BTC with ETH, due to the latter’s greater flexibility and wider variety of uses. Major asset manager, BlackRock recently shifted some of its BTC holdings to ETH. That said, some analysts are cautious of the trend of Ethereum treasury firms adding ETH on their balance sheets. At press time, ETH trades at $4,019, up 1.2% in the past 24 hours. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: Anthropic Expands Claude Code to Web and iOS for Cloud Coding
URL: https://www.iphoneincanada.ca/2025/10/20/anthropic-expands-claude-code-to-web-and-ios-for-cloud-coding/
Time Published: 2025-10-20T21:55:04Z
Full Content:
AI startup Anthropic is bringing its AI coding assistant Claude Code to the web and iOS, giving developers a way to run coding jobs straight from their browser or phone. The new tool, now in beta, lets users offload tasks like bug fixes, backend tweaks, or documentation updates—all handled in the cloud. Developers can connect GitHub repositories, describe what they need, and watch as Claude codes in real time inside a secure, isolated sandbox. Each task runs independently with live progress updates, and multiple jobs can run in parallel across different projects. When done, Claude automatically generates pull requests and change summaries. The iOS version offers a mobile-friendly way to steer code sessions on the go, though Anthropic says it’s an early preview meant for testing and feedback.

Title: BlackRock launches Bitcoin ETP in London

BlackRock’s latest move brings regulated Bitcoin exposure to UK investors for the first time. The iShares Bitcoin ETP (IB1T) opened strong on the LSE. BlackRock’s IB1T launched on the London Stock Exchange, giving UK retail investors direct access to Bitcoin. The launch follows the FCA’s policy shift, allowing retail access to crypto-linked products. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin ETP [IB1T] is now live on the London Stock Exchange [LSE]. This marks a key milestone for retail investors seeking regulated exposure to Bitcoin in the UK. The move signals both a policy shift from British regulators and BlackRock’s growing dominance in the digital-asset investment space. According to data from BlackRock’s official listing page, IB1T opened trading on 20 October 2025 at $11.10, climbing 5.54% on its first day. The exchange-traded product (ETP) is physically backed by Bitcoin. It offers investors direct exposure to the asset’s spot price without needing to hold or custody BTC themselves. BlackRock said the product carries a total expense ratio (TER) of 0.15% per annum until 31 December 2025, after which it will rise to 0.25%. The firm confirmed the ETP complies with UK regulatory requirements and maintains its reserves through regulated custodians. The launch follows the Financial Conduct Authority’s (FCA) decision to relax rules that had previously blocked retail participation in crypto-linked products. By approving products like IB1T, the UK is signaling a more pragmatic approach toward digital-asset investment. This aligns it with the U.S. and European markets that already allow similar instruments. The move also comes as Bitcoin trades around $110,000, recovering from recent volatility that briefly sent prices below $104,000. The renewed institutional inflows from newly launched products could help stabilize BTC’s trajectory and re-anchor market confidence. BlackRock’s debut places it among a growing list of European Bitcoin ETP issuers, including WisdomTree, 21Shares, and CoinShares, all of which operate similar products across Germany, Switzerland, and France. Traditional financial heavyweights are now competing head-to-head in Europe’s maturing digital-asset market, where regulation is fast becoming a competitive advantage. The new listing adds to BlackRock’s expanding digital-asset portfolio. Its portfolio includes a U.S.-listed Bitcoin ETF, an Ethereum ETP, and the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL). With the UK now opening the door to mainstream crypto investing, BlackRock’s move shows the growing convergence between traditional finance and blockchain-based assets. The iShares Bitcoin ETP could become a benchmark product for retail Bitcoin exposure in one of the world’s oldest and most influential financial centers.

© 2025 Coinspeaker LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. BlackRock, 21Shares, WisdomTree, and Bitwise have listed Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) ETPs on the London Stock Exchange as FCA lifts the ban. Top global asset managers like BlackRock, 21Shares, WisdomTree, and Bitwise have opened access to Bitcoin BTC $109 159 24h volatility: 1.0% Market cap: $2.18 T Vol. 24h: $72.74 B and Ethereum ETH $3 853 24h volatility: 0.2% Market cap: $465.14 B Vol. 24h: $37.90 B exchange-traded products that are available to UK retail investors. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin ETF will be listed on the London Stock Exchange (LSE), with its shares physically backed by BTC and held via Coinbase. The BlackRock Bitcoin ETF has already been a massive success in the US, becoming the fastest ETF in history to approach $100 billion AUM, within 18 months of launch. Speaking on the development, Jane Sloan, EMEA head of global product solutions at BlackRock, said: “Built on institutional-grade infrastructure, [the product] enables UK investors to gain exposure to bitcoin with the confidence of robust custody and regulatory oversight.” The development comes 12 days after the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) lifted its four-year ban on retail access to crypto exchange-traded notes (ETNs). As a result, this has opened the market to a wider investor base. Apart from BlackRock, other asset managers have also joined the listing race. On Monday, October 20, 21Shares listed two physically backed products for Bitcoin and Ethereum on the London Stock Exchange (LSE). It also includes a staking component for its Ethereum ETPs and a reduced 0.1% management fee for select offerings. The announcement comes as the asset manager also pushes for spot Dogecoin ETF approval in the US. 21Shares first launched its crypto ETPs for institutional investors in the UK last year, capturing 70% of total turnover on the London Stock Exchange (LSE), according to the company. Meanwhile, WisdomTree has listed its physically backed Bitcoin and Ethereum ETPs on the LSE with fees of 0.15% and 0.35%. This also follows its earlier institutional offering in the UK. Asset manager Bitwise also announced plans to list its Bitcoin and Ethereum ETPs on the LSE on Tuesday, with a reduced 0.05% fee on its Core Bitcoin ETP for at least six months. Back in 2021, UK’s top financial regulator FCA, had banned the sale, marketing, and distribution of crypto derivatives and exchange-traded notes (ETNs) to retail investors. With the latest policy shift, retail investors can now access these products through UK-regulated brokers and investment platforms, such as standard brokerage accounts and tax-efficient wrappers like ISAs and SIPPs, WisdomTree said on Monday. The update brings the UK’s regulatory framework closer in line with markets such as the U.S., Canada, Hong Kong, and the EU. However, the prohibition on retail access to broader crypto derivatives remains in effect. Disclaimer: Coinspeaker is committed to providing unbiased and transparent reporting.

Title: $1.2B exits US Bitcoin ETFs just as London makes crypto comeback

$600B in futures inflow could be on the horizon as analysts say Europe’s new ETNs could ignite the next wave of mainstream inflows. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. The 12 spot Bitcoin exchange-traded products (ETFs) in the United States reversed sharply last week, recording $1.2 billion in net outflows. According to SoSoValue data, this was their second-largest weekly setback since launching in January 2024. The pullback snapped a two-week run of inflows that had brought in more than $5 billion, a period many read as proof of deepening institutional conviction. Data from SoSoValue show that investors pulled capital from nearly every major issuer. BlackRock’s IBIT recorded a $276 million outflow, while Fidelity’s FBTC saw $169 million leave. Other major issuers, such as ARK Invest’s ARKB and Bitwise’s BITB, lost $290 million and $128 million, respectively, while Grayscale’s two funds shed $321 million. The reversal followed a volatile week for Bitcoin, which briefly dipped below $104,000 during the reporting period. Notably, this was its lowest price level since June. Industry experts linked the drawdown to macroeconomic conditions triggered by US-China tariff wars, that shook confidence in risk assets like Bitcoin. However, the flagship digital crypto asset has rebounded strongly above $110,000 as of press time amid recent developments in the market. While US flows turned defensive, a different story that would reshape retail access for Bitcoin was unfolding across the Atlantic. On Oct. 20, Bitcoin exchange-traded notes (ETNs) officially began trading on the London Stock Exchange. This marks the end of the UK’s three-year retail ban on crypto investment products. BlackRock led the debut with its iShares Bitcoin ETP, joined by other leading issuers like Bitwise. Meanwhile, early feedback about these products has been mixed, but they have still shown promising signs. ByteTree founder Charlie Morris said initial trading activity showed “success with platforms such as Interactive Investor, Swissquote, and Trading 212,” though some brokers like AJ Bell were slower to support access. Still, Bradley Duke, Bitwise’s head of Europe, opined that the launch of these products would mark a “big week” for retail investors because the “direction of travel is clear for crypto.” With a new wave of adoption emerging across the Atlantic and renewed institutional focus on Bitcoin, Galaxy Research believes that crypto investment products could attract up to $600 billion in new inflows as traditional financial institutions broaden distribution. According to the firm, the US advisory market represents a vast, largely untapped opportunity that would drive significant flows into BTC. It stated: “Roughly 300,000 financial advisors manage about $30 trillion in client assets. If even a modest 2% allocation to bitcoin ETFs emerged across this channel, that would translate to roughly $600 billion in potential inflows.” These wave of flows would would rival the entire global gold ETF market, now worth about $472 billion, and quadruple the combined $146 billion in assets under management (AUM) across US spot Bitcoin funds. The asset management firm pointed out that recent policy moves by leading traditional financial institiutions like Morgan Stanley and Vanguard support that thesis. Notably, Morgan Stanley recently recommended up to a 4% allocation to digital assets, while Vanguard is reportedly looking to offer select third-party crypto ETFs to its brokerage clients. These developments are expected to drive fresh capital into the emerging industry and further drive Bitcoin’s adoption. Galaxy Research argued that the full opening of large advisory platforms could mark a structural shift in how digital assets are integrated into mainstream finance. Once this access is fully enabled, financial advisors will be able to include crypto directly within traditional balanced portfolios, moving the asset class from retail-driven speculation toward advisor-led portfolio construction. It noted: “The impact could be substantial. New inflows may follow as wealth managers begin allocating to the asset class, potentially pushing total bitcoin ETF AUM to $500 billion within a few years, assuming just a 1% average allocation across managed portfolios. Such flows would reshape market dynamics and reinforce bitcoin’s position as a mainstream, investable asset.” Galaxy’s analysis further suggested that this transition could also bring a more mature form of liquidity. According to the firm, advisory-driven allocations tend to follow longer holding periods and stricter compliance frameworks, reducing the short-term turnover that has defined retail crypto trading. Over time, that discipline could enhance price stability, deepen liquidity, and align Bitcoin more closely with traditional asset classes such as equities, bonds, and gold.

Title: Ethereum In, Bitcoin Out: BlackRock Rebalancing Its Digital Asset Portfolio In Major Crypto Shift

Time Published: 2025-10-20T15:00:15Z

Following the recent market crash due to Donald Trump’s tariff order, the price of Bitcoin and Ethereum experienced a sharp decline below key support levels. While both coins fell strongly, ETH has emerged as the leading choice among major corporations, as these institutions swap their BTC for the altcoin leader. Major crypto assets such as Ethereum and Bitcoin are beginning to recover lost ground once again. Meanwhile, Ethereum appears to be leading the charge in terms of institutional adoption, reflecting the long-term potential of the leading altcoin. In a move that has triggered a frenzy across the crypto and traditional finance sectors, BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, is reportedly shifting a portion of its Bitcoin holdings into ETH. Coin Bureau shared this institutional pivot on the social media platform X, which has captured the attention of the crypto community. This daring rotation indicates a significant shift in institutional opinion and a rising belief in Ethereum’s sustained price growth. BlackRock‘s shift to ETH highlights the asset’s developing importance as the cornerstone of decentralized finance and next-generation financial infrastructure, even though Bitcoin keeps dominating as a store of value. Data shared by Coin Bureau reveals that the leading asset manager firm transferred about 272.4 BTC, valued at approximately $28.3 million, to Coinbase Prime. A few hours later, BlackRock was observed pulling out over 12,098 ETH worth $45.4 million. Bitmine Immersion Technologies Inc. has also been accumulating ETH at a significant and rapid rate. A recent report from BMNR Bullz shows that the leading treasury company purchased thousands of ETH within the past week to strengthen its digital asset treasury. Despite the recent market crash, the firm continues to double down on the altcoin, scooping up a total of 379,271 ETH, valued at $1.5 billion. With the massive purchase of Ethereum, Bitmine is demonstrating its conviction in the network’s expanding role in blockchain innovation. During the dip on Friday, Bitmine bought over 72,898 ETH worth $281 million. Three days prior to this acquisition, the firm purchased more than 104,336 ETH, valued at $417 million. Finally, a +202,037 ETH was made after the weekend crash, bringing the total to 379,271 ETH within a week. Bitmine’s persistent acquisition of the altcoin reflects the firm’s Co-CEO Tom Lee’s bold declaration that Ethereum will be the backbone of the digital economy. According to BMNR Bullz, this is not a buy signal, but a seismic shift. Prominent figures in the financial landscape are currently endorsing Ethereum. Robert Kiyosaki, a billionaire and author of the “Rich Dad Poor Dad” book, has included ETH as one of the key assets to hedge against the rising inflation across the world. While inflation keeps increasing and making it difficult for the poor and middle class, the billionaire has urged this set of people not to rely on government fake money or fiat currency. Instead, they should invest in Gold, Silver, Bitcoin, and Ethereum, which he labels the real money. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: Wall Street might be panicking over private credit but insiders can’t see what all the fuss is about

Lily Mae Lazarus is a news fellow at Fortune. Jim Edwards is the executive editor for global news at Fortune. He was previously the editor-in-chief of Business Insider's news division and the founding editor of Business Insider UK. His investigative journalism has changed the law in two U.S. federal districts and two states. The U.S. Supreme Court cited his work on the death penalty in the concurrence to Baze v. Rees, the ruling on whether lethal injection is cruel or unusual. He also won the Neal award for an investigation of bribes and kickbacks on Madison Avenue. On Oct. 15, two Wall Street titans offered radically different visions of the private credit market. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon warned investors that recent bankruptcies in private credit could be just the beginning: “When you see one cockroach, there are probably more.” Hours later, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink struck a defiant tone on his firm’s earnings call: “I’ve never been more excited about the future of BlackRock,” he said. BlackRock has bet $12 billion on private credit through its acquisition of HPS Investment Partners. So who is right? Investors have been so worried about the stability of private credit recently that their frantic selling drove up the VIX “fear” index by 35% over the past month. They are spooked by the collapse in September of Tricolor Holdings, a subprime auto lender and dealer, revealing allegations of fraud in which the company allegedly pledged the same collateral to multiple banks. Private credit was dealt another blow late last month when First Brands, an auto parts supplier, collapsed into bankruptcy, owing $10 billion, triggering federal investigations into $2.3 billion in missing funds. Then on Oct. 16, regional banks Zions Bancorporation disclosed fraud-related losses and Western Alliance flagged nearly nearly $100 million in alleged fraud, catalyzing a market rout that erased $100 billion in market cap from U.S. bank stocks and pushed market volatility to four-month highs. Major institutions tallied their damage: JPMorgan took $170 million in Tricolor losses; UBS disclosed over $500 million in First Brands exposure; and Jefferies revealed $715 million in questionable receivables. The private credit market—which has grown from $200 billion to $3 trillion globally in 15 years—suddenly looked vulnerable. But credit analysts and executives who spoke to Fortune have mixed views on Wall Street’s panic. Several argue that the failures aren’t private credit problems at all. According to them, these instances are traditional bank lending blowups, and the mislabeling reveals more about competitive tensions between old-guard banks and private credit disrupters than genuine systemic risk. The question, however, is whether these analysts are right, or whether they’re dangerously downplaying cracks in a $3 trillion market that is systemically important to global finance. The definition problem “First Brands, if it was rated by us, would not have been considered in any way, shape, or form a private credit transaction,” said Bill Cox, chief rating officer at Kroll Bond Rating Agency (KBRA), which tracks thousands of private credit loans. “Its main debt was full-on public, broadly syndicated loans.” This distinction matters. The broadly syndicated loan (BSL) market—dominated by large commercial banks—operates differently from the direct lending market that defines private credit. BSL loans are originated by banks, syndicated to multiple investors, and traded in public markets with daily pricing. Private credit loans, by contrast, are bilateral transactions between a lender and borrower, held to maturity in a “buy and hold” strategy with no secondary market trading. First Brands’ bankruptcy involved primarily BSL debt and receivables “factoring,” a form of lending where banks purchase a company’s accounts receivable at a discount in hopes of profiting later when clients pay their bills in full. Neither activity represents the core direct lending business that firms like Ares, Apollo, and Blackstone have built. “None of them do factoring,” Cox said of the dozens of private credit platforms his firm rates. “We looked at the entire universe of our CLOs, BDCs, and other facilities for exposure to First Brands. The exposure was de minimis,” he said, referring to collateralized loan obligations (bundles of loans sold to other investors) and business development companies (which are set up as investment bets on struggling or distressed companies). Brian Garfield, who heads U.S. portfolio valuation at investment banking firm Lincoln International, which performs over 6,500 quarterly valuations of private companies, echoed this view: “First Brands [largely had BSL facilities, and] that’s not the direct lending market. I think it’s important that we understand that alone in itself is really important, because there’s this whole combination of things that everyone is just putting … in one basket,” he told Fortune. The real state of private credit This isn’t to say private credit faces no challenges. Lincoln International’s proprietary data tracking the direct lending market shows covenant defaults—technical breaches of loan terms rather than payment failures—have risen from 2.2% in 2024 to 3.5% currently. Payment-in-kind (PIK) usage, where struggling borrowers defer cash interest payments, increased from 6.5% of deals in Q4 2021 to 11% today, with “bad PIKs” (repriced mid-deal) rising from 33% to over 50% of that total. “Are there cracks? Yes,” Garfield acknowledged. “But on average, are we seeing strong fundamental Ebitda growth? Yes.” His data shows last-12-months year-over-year Ebitda growth of 6% to 7%—the highest level since Q1 2021. KBRA’s analysis of 2,400 middle-market companies representing roughly $1 trillion in debt tells a similar story. Cox’s team projects defaults could peak at 5%, which he admitted is “a lot more than this industry has seen,” but he said was “relatively” low for public market comparables, the measure through which private company valuations can be derived by comparing the businesses to other similar companies that are already publicly traded on the stock market. Why the panic? Given the fundamentals aren’t catastrophic, analysts point to several factors beyond credit quality to explain investor anxiety, namely less stringent guardrails and documentation processes. “If something grows like a weed, maybe it is one,” Timur Braziler, who covers regional banks at Wells Fargo, told Fortune. “The availability of credit over the last five years, when you have more than one source competing for that same loan, maybe the underwriting isn’t as stringent.” Andrew Milgram, managing partner and chief investment officer of Marblegate Asset Management, an alternative investment firm focused on middle-market distressed and special situation investments, offered a more pointed critique: The competitive dynamics of unregulated lending inevitably lead to deteriorating standards. “When loans were done by banks, they were subject to oversight,” he explained. “As those loans moved out of the banking system into an unregulated environment, they began competing for business by loosening documentation, loosening underwriting standards.” Private credit loans are typically given out by nonbank lenders such as alternative asset managers, private equity firms, and pension funds. Without the guardrails and protections provided by traditional banks, who are beholden to regulators and the federal government, disaster can ensue, according to Milgram, who has long been skeptical of the private credit market. “Lending has been regulated in societies for all time. In fact, the Code of Hammurabi contemplated regulating lenders because every society, everywhere for all time has recognized that durable, responsible lending is central to the proper functioning of the economy,” he added. Cox sees a different dynamic at work: Competitive tensions between traditional banks and private credit upstarts have led to, in his opinion, a rise in misconstruing the overall risk of private credit and direct lending. “If your neighbor is saying it’s your dog that’s relieving itself on the lawn, and you know it’s not your dog, it’s pretty frustrating,” he says, noting that both Tricolor and First Brands were primarily bank lending failures, not private credit issues. He admits, however, that there are corners of the private credit market that are more exposed and involved in “riskier parts of credit,” where lenders provide loans at high risk in hopes of high returns. Private credit has a reputation for being directed at smaller, middle-market companies that are highly leveraged and potentially unable to secure traditional bank financing. While these firms may offer higher yields to offset the risk, they are more vulnerable to financial shocks. What comes next The debate over private credit’s risks won’t end with these bankruptcies. Braziler expects more fraud cases to emerge: “Just the abundance of credit, it makes sense that you’re going to have more of these bad characters.” However, he doesn’t see systemic risk to the banking sector. Tim Hynes, global head of credit research at Debtwire, expects continued stress but not catastrophe: “The weakest companies are starting to get hit as a result of the tariffs and economic slowdown. You’re going to see an increase in bankruptcies, but there isn’t systemic risk.” The real test may be transparency. Unlike BSL loans with daily market pricing, private credit valuations are less transparent, being updated quarterly using subjective methodologies. “It is really opaque,” Braziler notes. “It’s really hard to get a good understanding of who the end borrower is.” As BlackRock doubles down with its $12 billion HPS acquisition and Dimon warns of “cockroaches,” the private credit industry faces a credibility test. The question isn’t whether some loans will default—they will. It’s whether the industry’s risk management, documentation standards, and valuation practices can pass a financial stress test. “Anyone who has any amount of meaningful exposure to corporate credit markets, and in particular the leverage loan corporate credit markets, should be reexamining their portfolio in excruciating detail at this moment and really thinking hard about the quality of the underwriting that has gone into making those loans and the veracity of the reporting that supports their understanding of the performance of the business,” Milgram said. For now, the analysts who track private credit most closely see warning signs, not apocalypse. But in a market where definitional confusion obscures risk and competitive tensions drive narratives, distinguishing signal from noise is increasingly critical and difficult. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.
