ByBilly Bambrough ByBilly Bambrough , Senior Contributor. 03/10 update below. This post was originally published on March 09 Bitcoin and crypto prices—including ethereum, Ripple’s XRP, solana’s SOL and cardano’s ADA—have flat-lined over the last week after Donald Trump revealed the cryptocurrencies that the U.S. was betting on, sparking market mayhem. Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes’ CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" The bitcoin price has fallen back to around $85,000 per bitcoin, exactly where it was at the beginning of March (despite China quietly priming the bitcoin price for a major earthquake). Now, as Elon Musk issues a surprise crypto price warning, Donald Trump’s crypto czar has said the U.S. Treasury will be working to “maximize the value” of the bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies held by the U.S. in its reserve and crypto stockpile. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run President Donald Trump has said he plans on making the U.S. the world's bitcoin "superpower" as the ... [+] price of cryptocurrencies XRP, solana, cardano and ethereum brace for huge shock. “We’re going to move the [cryptocurrency owned by the U.S. government] to the digital stockpile,” David Sacks, a technology investor and entrepreneur who has joined the Trump administration as artificial intelligence and crypto czar, said on the All In Podcast he cohosted before taking the job. “The purpose of the stockpile is responsible stewardship, it’s a place for safekeeping, it’s a centralized account under the direction of the secretary of the Treasury and the secretary of the Treasury will figure out how to maximize the value of these holdings.” 03/10 update: The bitcoin price has dropped to $80,000 per bitcoin over night before rebounding slightly but fresh fears have emerged that bitcoin could be headed to around $70,000—at which point things "will be violent," according to BitMex founder and crypto investor Arthur Hayes. “With bitcoin dipping below $80,000, approximately 70% of all selling came from investors who bought within the last three months, highlighting the dominance of recent entrants panic-selling into the decline,” Markus Thielen, the chief executive of market advisory company 10x Research, said in an emailed note. The rest of the crypto top ten have followed bitcoin lower, with ethereum hitting $2,000 for the first time since late 2023. Ethereum rival solana and the meme-based dogecoin are leading the market lower, each down around 6%. "In the short-term, expect bitcoin to drop as low as $72,000 and ethereum to hit $1,600 while the administration seeks to control inflation," Zach Burks, the chief executive of non-fungible token (NFT) service provider Mintology, said in emailed comments. “Many investors are pulling out of bitcoin, viewing it as a risky asset class for the first time since Trump took the White House. It’s no longer playing its role as a store of value—gold prices have spiked as many go back to the original ‘doomsday asset,’ which is no surprise as tariffs and grenades continue to get thrown across the free world.” This week, after Trump’s surprise announcement that Ripple’s XRP, solana and cardano would form the basis of a U.S. crypto reserve, the White House has shuffled its plans to create a bitcoin-only strategic reserve alongside a crypto stockpile made up of smaller cryptocurrencies including ethereum, Ripple’s XRP, cardano and solana. "The crypto stockpile should be subject to good portfolio management and fortunately we have a secretary of the Treasury who is an extremely successful former hedge fund manager so he’s going to figure out the best way to manage these assets and we give him the flexibility to do portfolio management," Sacks said. Speaking at the much-hyped White House crypto summit this week, alongside Sacks and Treasury secretary Scott Bessent, Trump confirmed his commitment to bitcoin—placing it in a unique position above other cryptocurrencies in a reserve described as a “digital Fort Knox” in a reference to the U.S. gold reserve. “I promised to make America the bitcoin superpower of the world and the crypto capital of the planet,” Trump said, it was reported by the New York Times. “We’re taking historic action to deliver on that promise.” In July, then Republican candidate Donald Trump promised to create a "strategic national bitcoin reserve" and predicted bitcoin could eclipse gold’s near-$20 trillion market capitalization during an appearance at the Bitcoin 2024 conference. During Friday’s White House summit, Trump also called it "foolish" of the government to have previously sold so much of its seized bitcoin, while Sacks, speaking on the podcast, claimed the U.S. might have lost as much as $16 billion by selling off its bitcoin. "At one point in time, we had about 400,000 bitcoin on the federal balance sheet. We sold roughly half of that for something like $360 million total," Sacks said during the podcast. "If we had held all of that, just that the portion we sold would be worth over $17 billion." Ahead of the summit, Trump signed an executive order calling for the creation of the bitcoin reserve and crypto stockpile using existing government holdings, disappointing traders with a lack of commitment to new bitcoin and crypto purchases though leaving the door open to acquiring more bitcoin though “budget neutral” methods that “do not impose incremental costs on United States taxpayers." Sacks added during a press conference that the Treasury and Commerce department, led by bitcoin price bull Howard Lutnick, are only “allowed to buy more if it doesn't add to the deficit or the debt.” Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has dipped from the peak it reached after Donald Trump's election victory, ... [+] dragging down the price of ethereum, XRP, solana, cardano and the wider crypto market. “The subpar strategic bitcoin reserve move triggered the uncertainty in the crypto market,” Agne Linge, head of growth at crypto platform WeFi, said in emailed comments. “With the executive order directing agencies to consolidate seized bitcoin to form the reserve, crypto investors see the move as a trick, as no new bitcoin purchase was announced. Despite the knee-jerk reaction from investors, the fact is that the bitcoin reserve mandate authorizes the acquisition of bitcoin through means that will not cost taxpayers’ money. The available options in this regard include bitcoin bonds and the sales of its gold reserve to fund more purchases. In the long term, the bitcoin reserve shift might benefit the coin. This thesis hinges on a possible race it has triggered that may see other sovereign nations make similar moves.” Some have speculated that China is weighing the creation of its own bitcoin reserve to rival the U.S. after Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund revealed last month it’s betting on bitcoin, kicking off a global adoption “race." “The U.S. bitcoin reserve raises the likelihood of other nations adopting similar reserves and accelerates their consideration of such initiatives,” analysts with Tagus Capital wrote in an emailed note. “With the U.S. planning to adopt bitcoin reserves, this is likely to drive broader global adoption, with more nations integrating bitcoin into their reserves—potentially shifting from gold to digital assets, much like how some economies have embraced the U.S. dollar alongside or instead of their own currencies.”

Published: March 07, 2025 Yet companies keep using them over and over. In 2001, after the 9/11 terrorist attack on the World Trade Center upended American travel, layoffs rippled through the airline industry. By late September, ~81k jobs had been cut industry-wide. Nearly everyone made cuts, from bargain carriers like Frontier and Spirit to heavyweights like American, US Airways, and United, which each laid off between 15%-23% of their workers. The lone holdout was Southwest Airlines. It delayed purchases of new planes and nixed a renovation of its corporate headquarters, but it didn’t enact layoffs. Co-founder and former CEO Herb Kelleher saw them as anathema for a successful company. “Nothing kills your company’s culture like layoffs,” Kelleher once said. If that’s true, then company culture has experienced an economy-wide massacre in recent years: Even Southwest joined the club, announcing mass layoffs for the first time in over 50 years in February. Kelleher wasn’t around to see them. He died in 2019. Herb Kelleher addresses stockholders. (David Woo/Corbis via Getty Images) Research has consistently shown he was right about layoffs: They’re damaging to companies — especially when done for cost-cutting purposes; they’re damaging to laid off employees, who’ve seen higher rates of suicide in the aftermath of layoffs; and they’re damaging to the employees who keep their jobs. So why do companies keep doing them? Once upon a time, US businesses had far more people who thought like Herb Kelleher. In the middle of the 20th century, as America entered an era of unprecedented prosperity, influential companies practiced a form of capitalism that balanced profits with employee welfare and the public good. Seasonal employees got axed at times, but mass layoffs were relatively rare, as workers routinely stayed at a single company for much of their career. Things changed starting around the 1980s. As companies sought to rebound from a nationwide economic funk, they began practicing a more rough-and-tumble capitalism that prized shareholder value and ushered in a “free agent” model of employment. Celebrity CEOs like “Neutron” Jack Welch and “Chainsaw” Al Dunlap popularized a style of management predicated on reducing costs to produce short-term profits. Clockwise from left: Chainsaw Al Dunlap, Elon Musk with chainsaw, Neutron Jack Welch. (John Pineda/Hulton Archive via Getty Images, Valerie Plesch/Washington Post via Getty Images, Thomas Lohne/DDP/AFP via Getty Images) One of their favorite tools was mass layoffs. Welch, who ran General Electric, laid off more than 100k employees during his 20-year tenure. Every fiscal year, he’d rank workers and slash the bottom 10%. Dunlap’s strategy was to cut quickly and deeply — and ask questions later. “My philosophy is to err on the side of too much,” Dunlap wrote in his memoir, Mean Business. “Too many asset sales. Too many layoffs.” Plenty of corporations followed their example: Olivia Heller/The Hustle “All of a sudden,” David Gelles, author of the Welch biography The Man Who Broke Capitalism, told NPR, “other CEOs saw that…if we rapidly wind down the cost of our labor, we could potentially see a meaningful increase in earnings per share for the next quarter and Wall Street sure liked that.” That ethos remains today. Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that 1.5m-2m Americans are typically laid off or discharged every month, a number that increases during recessions. But the belief that company earnings and stock prices increase through layoffs typically doesn’t match reality. At best, research indicates that companies that lay off employees, on average, don’t see a better financial payoff in the long term compared to companies with a stable employment base. And they often fare worse. There are findings that suggest layoffs lead to both short-term and long term issues, including: Even during bad economies, when layoffs are rampant and often more justified, the results are similar — and that’s according to Bain & Company, which, ironically, consults for firms that make cuts. After the early-2000s dotcom bust, Bain researchers found that stock prices for S&P 500 companies that had no layoffs or laid off less than 3% of their workforce increased an average of 9% in the next year. Meanwhile, stock prices were flat in companies that laid off between 3%-10% of their workers, and prices plummeted 38% for companies that laid off more than 10%. Laid off tech workers network at a “Pink Slip Party” in San Francisco after the dotcom bust in 2001. (David McNew/Newsmakers via Getty Images) Some of these issues stem from the fact that a company that does layoffs is typically in distressed shape already. But experts have found several other reasons for why layoffs lead to negative results: As they recruit, these companies often find their reputation has been damaged among potential applicants, says Wayne Cascio, a professor emeritus at the University of Colorado Denver who’s researched layoffs for decades. “If they have two offers and one is with a company that just had layoffs last year and another one is with a company that hasn’t had layoffs, which one are you going to pick?” Plus, the employees who survive layoffs grow discontent with the company and burn out faster as they handle more tasks, Cascio adds, leading to expensive voluntary worker exits. Layoffs don’t always portend future problems: Companies who enact them as part of a broader change in strategy, Cascio says, fare better than those who enact them simply to cut costs. It’s also true that recent layoffs among some tech brands have been accompanied by positive reactions from investors: Some tech layoffs fit into a category that Cascio describes as proactive downsizing. The companies were relatively healthy but realized they’d hired too much during the pandemic or saw signs of struggles down the road that they believed they could avoid with restructuring. Olivia Heller/The Hustle Still, says Jeffrey Pfeffer, a Stanford University Graduate School of Business professor and expert on organizational behavior, “the tech layoffs make no sense to me.” He attributes some of them to a contagion effect that led to companies enacting layoffs simply because everyone else did it. And if overhiring or underperformance was the true problem, Pfeffer says the companies should question their leaders, who green-lit the overhiring and may have failed to develop productive roles for their employees. “You could blame the workforce,” he says, “or the managers and leaders who are leading that workforce.” Some companies clearly trust management over the workforce. After a layoffs announcement last month, Meta doubled the potential amount of bonuses its executives can receive this year. So, what are the best alternatives to layoffs? As Southwest Airlines showed in 2001, companies can reduce expenses by delaying purchases and investments, cutting in places that don’t lead to job losses. If that’s not enough, Wayne Cascio says companies should attempt to reduce hours or initiate furloughs (a temporary unpaid leave of absence) rather than layoffs. His research has shown that, even if layoffs occur, companies that try these alternatives perform better than those who instantly lay off employees when faced with financial problems. At least during the pandemic, many companies showed a willingness to delay or resist layoffs. Cascio says that a survey from the Society for Human Resources Management found that a majority of firms enacted furloughs or cut travel and employee perks before laying off workers. Olivia Heller/The Hustle Still, as the last few years have shown, layoffs are happening — and often without any signs that they’re indicative of larger strategic moves. The problem, Cascio says, is that there are only two ways to make money in business: growing revenues or cutting costs. Slashing costs is a far more predictable way to ensure future growth than finding new ways to generate revenue. And, too often, companies do the predictable thing. Pfeffer was reminded of this impulse on a recent flight when he got upgraded to first class and ended up next to an airline executive. The industry had used buyouts and layoffs to shrink staff sizes during the pandemic and faced difficulties in refilling positions when demand picked up. Pfeffer told the executive the layoffs had been a terrible idea. Then he asked him if his airline had gotten rid of any airplanes when business was down. The executive said it had not. “So why,” Pfeffer says, “get rid of employees?” Get the 5-minute newsletter keeping 2M+ innovators in the loop. Want even more business resources?

Title: How BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has turned into the darling of the MAGA movement

Full Content:
Larry Fink: MAGA Hero Yes, you read that right. The BlackRock CEO fat cat the political right had loved to hate has suddenly become the darling of the MAGA movement following his $22.8 billion purchase of ports from Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison, including, very importantly, two in the Panama Canal zone. The deal is big in size and significance since those Panama Canal ports are now no longer run by a Hong Kong company and under Chinese control; they are now in the hands of a US corporation, something President Trump demanded upon taking office just weeks ago. “China is operating the Panama Canal. And we didn’t give it to China,” the president said in his inaugural address, no less. “We gave it to Panama, and we’re taking it back.” Fink did just that, and it marks one of the craziest 180s I have ever seen covering the confluence of politics and finance for 30 years. After being the bane of conservatives everywhere for years, largely for his support of lefty ­Environmental Social Governance investing, Mr. ESG has become Mr. MAGA in the eyes of the Republican faithful. GOP critics, who tried to cancel BlackRock contracts in Red State America, are looking to back down. “Larry just pulled one the biggest political upsets ever” is how one deal lawyer described Fink’s new status. Truth be told, Fink is still a staunch Democrat. His woke rep obscured his acumen as a businessman. He created BlackRock from scratch nearly 30 years ago and grew it into a colossus, the world’s largest asset manager. He saw money in ESG and then saw money leaving it behind when the political climate changed. Over the years, he’s has cultivated some the biggest clients in the world. He manages money for sovereign wealth funds, pension funds and lots of rich people — including, for a time, a certain real estate developer-turned-reality TV star named Donald J Trump. He and the now-president remain close, an important plus in their Panama Canal dealings. Recall, it was Trump during his first term, meeting with bankers at the White House, who spotted Fink and said “Larry did a great job for me. He managed a lot of my money. I have to tell you, he got me great returns.” Being smart about markets and sensing how the political winds blow is also how Fink got interested in CK Hutchison. The conglomerate, among other businesses, controls 43 ports around the world, including several very important to global shipping, in places like the Suez Canal and two buttressing the Panama Canal. The Panama Canal connection is key, given its importance to the US economy and trade. The shipping lane was created around the turn of the last century by the US government; it slices through the five-mile isthmus to connect the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. You didn’t have to go around South America to get to China and Japan, just through the Panama Canal. The US controlled the canal until 1977 when it turned it over to the government of Panama, and ever since, the relationship between the countries has been fraught. Panama was run by a drug trafficker, Gen. Manuel Noriega, whom in 1990 the US military arrested after a land invasion. More recently, the Panama tension surrounded the Chinese, increasingly our global nemesis, with canal access a means to exert its economic and military power. In 1997, Hutchison secured the rights to the canal’s two vital ports through 2046, which to many translates into de facto Chinese control of a valued shipping lane given the control exerted by the ruling Chinese Communist Party on China Inc. Fink, meanwhile, saw a way to make money and appease the Trumpers in DC. Increasingly the firm had been investing and developing infrastructure around the world, and Hutchison was ripe for a buyout. It was profitable, making really good money after COVID when ports became jammed in a supply-chain crisis. Yet Wall Street somehow didn’t like the company. Maybe it was the Chinese connection since pols in both major parties have been throttling deals by any company with China ties. Either way, Fink and his team noticed that Hutchison’s stock was trading at just around 30% of its so-called “book value,” the value of its assets minus liabilities. It was, in a word, cheap. Talks between both sides have been off-and-on for years. (BlackRock was thinking about just buying its stock.) When Trump took office and began mentioning the need to retake the Panama Canal from the Chinese (not exactly accurate but close enough for deal-making purposes), Hutchison was ready to move as was Fink. The company met with other private equity players — Blackstone, KKR — but settled on BlackRock given what Fink brought to the table. He acquired a world-class infrastructure firm in 2024 and, of course, he still has his relationship with Trump, who could block any deal through any of several US regulatory agencies. After working through the Trump Cabinet last weekend just before the deal was inked, Fink called Trump directly to break the news. “Trump was thrilled,” one person with knowledge of the conversation stated, and a MAGA star was born.

Title: Will Trump Develop Alaskan Oil and Gas?

She has a Master’s in International Development from the University of Birmingham, UK. More Info United States President Donald Trump has vowed to make it easier to develop oil and gas projects in Alaska, despite concerns about environmental degradation. Trump signed an executive order on his first day in office to “unleash Alaska’s extraordinary resource potential”, effectively undoing former President Biden’s climate protections for the state. However, it is uncertain whether oil and gas companies will invest in a region with such strict regulations and high project development costs. In addition, many fear potential lawsuits from environmental and indigenous organisations against new developments, as well as what a change in U.S. administration could mean for projects in the future. President Trump’s order aims to expedite the permitting and leasing of energy projects in Alaska, undo resource development restrictions on state and federal lands including crucial areas such as the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) and the National Petroleum Reserve (NPR-A), overturn the cancellation of leases within the ANWR, and prioritise the development of LNG. Alaska’s oil production decreased from around 2 million bpd in 1988 to just 426,000 bpd in 2023, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. At present, just two major projects are under development, ConocoPhillips’s $8 billion Willow and Santos’ Pikka, which are expected to increase the state’s output to 650,000 bpd. Many oil and gas companies are wary of developing projects in Alaska due to the high costs involved with operations, the lack of regulatory stability, and litigation risks. Much of the state’s oil and gas reserves are within federally protected lands such as ANWR and NPR-A, which make project development risky, as a change in administration could mean more policy changes. In addition, several environmental groups have launched lawsuits against oil and gas developers in Alaska in recent years, citing environmental and climate concerns. “We’ve seen this before… where this administration breaks the law we will fight and we will enforce the environmental laws in Alaska,” the managing attorney at Earthjustice Carole Holley stated. Referring to the areas Trump is aiming to reopen for oil and gas exploration, senior vice president of policy at the American Petroleum Institute Dustin Meyers stated, “Many of these areas have been closed for a good long while.” Meyers added, “There is always the risk that these areas could be reclosed after the next election cycle.” This view reflects the concerns of several oil majors. Meanwhile, the International Energy Agency expects global demand for oil to slow over the next decade, while many oil and gas companies are moving to easier-to-develop areas where they can implement “low-carbon oil” operations. The Trump administration aims to attract investment for the $44 billion Alaska LNG project on Alaska’s North Slope, originally proposed by the state-owned Alaska Gasline Development Corporation (AGDC) around a decade ago. The project was authorized by President Trump’s administration in 2020 and was reauthorized by the Biden administration in 2022. If developed, it could provide 20 million tonnes of LNG per year. “[Alaska] is the closest point of major oil and gas to Japan by far. We’re talking about a joint venture of some type between Japan and [the US] having to do with Alaska oil and gas,” Trump said at a joint press conference. However, over the last decade, several big players, including BP, ConocoPhillips and ExxonMobil, have pulled out of the project. While it is unlikely that oil majors will flock to Alaska, given the plethora of challenges involved with managing oil and gas operations in the state, the threat of tariffs from the Trump administration could reinvigorate interest. On 4th March, Trump introduced 25 percent tariffs on the import of Mexican and Canadian products and an additional 10 percent on Chinese goods. This has made other countries fear a similar move on their products. Trump has threatened tariffs on various countries and regions, such as the EU, if they do not increase the purchase of energy from the U.S. in the coming months. In early February, Japanese trading giant Mitsui announced it may consider investing in the Alaska LNG project, although no decisions had been made. Japan is the second-largest LNG importer globally and the government has stated that it may be open to purchasing more LNG and other energy products from the U.S., most likely in a bid to avoid U.S. tariffs on Japanese products. A few days later, Taiwan’s Economy Ministry expressed interest in purchasing more LNG from the U.S., particularly from Alaska. Taiwan’s state energy company CPC is “indeed quite interested in Alaska's natural gas and will continue to assess the feasibility and is also willing to make additional purchases,” the Ministry said in a statement. Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and several EU member states have expressed interest in buying more U.S. oil and gas to reduce trade gaps that put them at risk of U.S. tariffs. However, with record highs being seen in U.S. gas production over the last year, it is not clear whether this will attract the interest and investment needed to develop new fossil fuel operations in Alaska.

Title: BlackRock And Grayscale Urged to Consider A Shiba Inu (SHIB) ETF For These Reasons

The Shiba Inu (SHIB) community is ramping up efforts to advocate for a SHIB-focused exchange-traded fund (ETF), calling on major asset management firms like BlackRock and Grayscale Investments to take action. Momentum behind the initiative has been growing rapidly, with a Change.org petition directed at Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein surpassing 16,666 signatures as of press time. Meanwhile, influential SHIB group “Shibzens” have recently outlined compelling reasons why SHIB deserves ETF status, drawing parallels to the recent success of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. As per the group, one of the strongest arguments for a SHIB ETF is the cryptocurrency’s massive and highly engaged community. With millions of holders actively participating in the SHIB ecosystem, it argued that the token enjoys a loyal user base that could drive demand, liquidity, and long-term price stability, key factors for a successful ETF. Shiba Inu’s Layer-2 blockchain, Shibarium, further strengthens its case. Since its launch in August 2023, the group emphasized that Shibarium has introduced real-world utility by powering decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, gaming projects, and payment solutions. The network also supports ecosystem tokens like BONE, used for gas fees, and TREAT, which could be incorporated into a diversified SHIB ETF, expanding its investment appeal. Another major factor is affordability. Unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum, which can be expensive for small investors, SHIB’s low price per token makes it an accessible entry point for retail traders. This inclusivity allows a broader investor base to gain crypto exposure, while SHIB’s high trading volume and strong liquidity provide a solid foundation for institutional ETF products. A SHIB ETF could also align with Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) investment strategies. The Shib Karma Foundation, a philanthropic initiative within the SHIB ecosystem, highlights the community’s commitment to social good. Additionally, SHIB’s growing adoption across industries, including gaming and payments, demonstrates its increasing real-world relevance and utility. This push comes amid significant political and institutional shifts that signal a growing acceptance of cryptocurrency, further strengthening the case for a SHIB ETF. Former U.S. President Donald Trump recently acknowledged major digital assets like XRP, Solana, and Cardano, fueling speculation that increased regulatory clarity could benefit altcoins like SHIB. On Friday, the President hosted the first-ever White House Crypto Summit, bringing together key figures in the crypto industry. Among them was Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev, a well-known advocate for meme-based assets whose involvement has further bolstered optimism. The SHIB community led by lead developer Shytoshi Kusama have expressed optimism that Tenev could play a role in advocating for the inclusion of meme coins like SHIB and Dogecoin in the discussions. That said, while BlackRock and Grayscale have yet to submit a formal application for a SHIB ETF, the precedent set by Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs proves that crypto-based investment products are viable. With strong community backing, increasing adoption, and favorable market trends, Shibizens believe SHIB is next in line.

Title: Avalanche’s daily sign-ups hit 6,000 – Identifying the reasons behind the boom

AVAX’s rapid user growth in 2025 highlights potential for a breakout. And yet, it’s largely overlooked. Avalanche [AVAX] has been quietly gaining momentum, with new user sign-ups surging in Q1 2025. While the market often fixates on Ethereum’s L2 boom and Bitcoin ETFs, Avalanche’s rapid adoption has been overlooked somewhat. In fact, history suggests that user growth often precedes major price shifts. With DeFi and GameFi activity accelerating, could Avalanche be positioning itself as the next breakout L1? Avalanche’s new user growth has seen clear fluctuations over the past two years, with periodic cycles of rapid expansion followed by cooling-off periods. In fact, the latest surge in early 2025 was one of the strongest spikes since mid-2023. It saw monthly new users exceeding 600,000 and average daily sign-ups surpassing 6,000 at its peak. This seemed to be in stark contrast to mid-to-late 2024, when user acquisition stagnated below 200,000 per month. Source: X The pattern suggested that Avalanche tends to experience bursts of adoption, likely triggered by key ecosystem developments or broader market conditions. If this trend continues, the Q1 2025 spike could signal renewed investor and developer interest, potentially setting the stage for sustained growth. Avalanche’s recent surge can be attributed to a $250 million investment in December 2024, led by Galaxy Digital and Dragonfly Capital, aimed at expanding its ecosystem. Additionally, the Avalanche9000 upgrade, launched on 16 December, reduced transaction fees by 75% – Driving a 38% hike in daily transactions and further boosting network activity. Institutional adoption has been rising too, with major players like BlackRock and Franklin Templeton leveraging Avalanche for tokenized funds. Despite its surge in new users, Avalanche remains largely absent from mainstream crypto discussions. Much of the market’s attention is focused on Ethereum’s L2 expansion and Bitcoin ETF inflows, leaving Avalanche’s growth relatively overlooked. Media coverage has also been skewed, with Ethereum roll-ups and Solana’s memecoin frenzy dominating headlines. Another factor contributing to its relative silence is the lack of high-profile endorsements. Unlike Solana, which benefits from outspoken backers like Visa and Jump Crypto, Avalanche is yet to secure a similarly visible champion. However, this under-the-radar momentum might create an opportunity for early adopters positioning themselves ahead of a broader market realization. Source: IntoTheBlock IntoTheBlock data indicated that AVAX’s price action has closely followed whale activity, with occasional spikes in large transactions aligning with price movements. This suggested that institutional and whale investors remain engaged, though sustained accumulation might be uncertain. Source: IntoTheBlock Finally, there is a correlation between active addresses in profit and AVAX’s price cycles. Historically, sharp increases in profitable addresses have often preceded local price tops, while periods of underwater holders have set the stage for recoveries. If these patterns hold, AVAX could see further upside in 2025, provided demand remains strong and broader market conditions are favorable.

Title: Pile into Persian rugs: Peter Linden collection at Adam’s
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/life-style/fine-art-antiques/2025/03/08/pile-into-persian-rugs-peter-linden-collection-at-adams/

Antique rugs and carpets often don’t get the attention they deserve at auctions, yet these incredibly detailed decorative furnishings carry a rich heritage of highly skilled craftwork and symbolic imagery inspired by nature, mythology and world religions. That said, the exotic patterns and geographical origins of handwoven Persian rugs have captivated collectors for centuries. With natural dyes made from berries, insects, minerals and seeds, the dye recipes and weaving techniques in different regions were often carefully guarded secrets. In Ireland, the Swedish-born Per Lindfors (aka Peter Linden) was an acclaimed expert on antique carpets, rugs kilims and tapestries. From a young age, he soaked up knowledge of Persian rugs from his father – an avid collector – and his connections with Persian rug experts in Stockholm. And when he moved to Ireland, he ran the Peter Linden Gallery in Blackrock from 1979 until 2006. Thereafter, he continued to work at antique fairs and advise private clients worldwide on the provenance of antique carpets and rugs. His death in July 2024 marked the end of an era. In an interview with The Irish Times in 2019, Lindfors advised buyers to be alert to carpets, which have a darker colour at the root of the pile, as this indicates the dye is inferior quality. It may also mean that it has been given an antique wash, ie a chemical bath and left to age in the sun afterwards to make it look much older. Carpets are considered to be antique when they are 100 years old. Now, Adam’s – who previously sold much of the contents of the Peter Linden gallery in 2006- are selling the remaining stock, alongside some of his personal collection which he enjoyed with his wife, Celine, in their Dublin home. Some striking examples, from the auction of 94 lots, include: an antique Milas prayer rug from 1850, its border decorated with Solomon stars and blossoms (€3,500-€5,000); a Tree-of-Life Isfahan rug circa 1890-1900 decorated with elaborate foliage and birds framing a central vase (€700-€1,000); and an old Dobag carpet, hand knotted in Turkey 1995 (€3,500-€4,500). The Dobag project was a co-operative movement which started in the 1990s in Turkey to revive the handspun, natural dying techniques of antique rugs, but is no longer. The online auction, which also includes Lindfors’s library of reference books, finishes on Wednesday, March 12th, with viewing today/tomorrow from 1pm-5pm and on Monday/Tuesday from 10am-5pm. Also at Adam’s next week, is their spring jewellery online auction on Tuesday, March 11th, at 11am. Charming seasonal pieces include: a floral basket Giardinetto bouquet brooch (€2,000-€3,000); and two diamond bee brooches (€500-€700/€400-€600); and a diamond ballerina brooch in the style of the French jewellery house, Van Cleef & Arpels (€5,000-€6,000). Another more unusual piece is a sapphire and diamond ring, which unfolds to form a bracelet (€600-€800). Meanwhile, a collector of silver is selling his entire collection at Matthews Auction Rooms in Kells, Co Meath. The collection includes everything from silver tea sets to bowls, salvers, cutlery, boxes, novelty items (such as the Vesta case in the shape of a lying cow, at €40-€70), silver cased pocket watches and sets of silver coins. “The sets of 25 coins with original bank packaging are all pure silver, as are the one-kilo bars,” says Damien Matthews, who believes they will be well sought after. “They are all in mint condition and all way estimated below their scrap value.” The Matthews auction also has a series of three gold coins commemorating the 100th anniversary of the 1916 Easter Rising. The 1oz gold coin has an estimate of €2,500-€3,500, while the ½oz gold coin has an estimate of €1,250-€2,250, and the ¼oz gold coin is priced as €800-€1,200. The seven hundred lots of jewellery contains a treasure trove of rings, bracelets, necklaces of various vintage and priced with plenty to suit all tastes. Natasha Bernon, from O’Reilly’s Auction Rooms, agrees that buying silver or gold jewellery can be a good way to invest. “The price of gold is at an all-time high [gold peaked at$2,956.15 on February 24th], which is encouraging people to put their money into something tangible,” she says. An eastern style set of two 21ct gold bangles (€800-€1,200), is one such example of gold jewellery on offer at the O’Reilly’s online fine jewellery sale, which ends on Wednesday, March 12th.

Title: Ireland v France: Live updates from crunch Six Nations clash at the Aviva
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/rugby/2025/03/08/ireland-v-france-live-updates-from-crunch-six-nations-clash-at-the-aviva/

That’s all from us for today. A disappointing result but them’s the breaks. Before we go, Scotland are after beating Wales 35-29 (read the report from Murrayfield here). So that just leaves England v Italy tomorrow (kick-off 3pm). We’ll be back here this day next week for Super Saturday. Until then, take it easy. And Gerry Thornley’s piece from the Ireland press conference is in: It’s been a long, long time since an Irish team has been rolled over in such a lopsided manner, especially at home. The home team and the home crowd, who were even more comprehensively second best, were left reeling as France scored 34 unanswered points in a blue blur of power and pace. Unbeaten at home in the Six Nations since France won here behind closed doors in 2021, Ireland had seemed relatively well set, or at any rate highly competitive, when Dan Sheehan’s 43rd-minute try and Sam Prendergast’s touchline conversion put them 13-8 ahead. Even interim head coach Simon Easterby felt so. “We felt like going in at half-time 8-6 down we were well in the game, and we were confident that if we started well – which we did – in the second half, we could kick on and make them pay, in terms of our fitness and our ability to go well in second halves, which we have done in previous games. “But, unfortunately, we probably didn’t take enough of our opportunities in their 22, and vice versa, we conceded too easily ourselves.” Read Gerry’s full piece from the press conference here We’re back, and as promised we’ve some post-match reaction for you. First up: Fabien Galthié. Malachy Clerkin sat in on the France head coach’s press conference, and seemingly had to whip out the old English-French dictionary: Fabien Galthié was in no mood afterwards. The France coach pointedly didn’t take any questions in English but you didn’t need Duolingo to understand that he had a bone to pick. Losing Antoine Dupont to a serious knee injury midway through the first half coloured his reaction to everything. His captain was in tears in the dressingroom, Pierre-Louis Barassi didn’t make it through a HIA. Galthié was annoyed on both counts. “Our players did not return to the pitch,” he said. “We would like to understand why. On this issue, we are angry. We want to protect our players. There are means, [there are] rules. The [citing] commissioner must study the actions that are reprehensible or not. Neither Antoine nor Pierre-Louis returned to the pitch. One for a cleaning, the other for a contact. “For Antoine, there is suspicion of a fairly serious knee injury. I won’t go into details due to medical confidentiality, but Antoine is suffering. We have cited players to appear before the [Six Nations disciplinary] committee – Tadhg Beirne and Andrew Porter. Calvin Nash has also been summoned before the committee, for Pierre-Louis Barassi because he did not respond favourably to the protocol. “We feel bad for [Antoine]. In terms of the action, in my opinion it was reprehensible, and there are ways to study and analyse it. We feel for him today. He is suffering and we are suffering with him.” Read Malachy’s full piece from the press conference here Gerry Thornley’s dispatches from Simon Easterby’s press conference will be with us shortly. Thank you all for your company but hang tough, that reaction is coming. We will have more port match reaction from Gerry Thornley on Simon Easterby’s press conference and Malachy Clerkin who is looking after all things French. Midi Olympique give Yoram Moefana (8.5) and Francois Cros (8.5) to top their player ratings while two-try hero, Louis Bielle-Biarrey gets an eight. 🎥 Un bijou signé Louis Bielle-Biarrey 💎An absolute beauty from Louis Bielle-Biarrey 💎#FRAIRL | #SixNationsRugby pic.twitter.com/vKe4oI4dcv On the incident that saw Dupont suffer a knee injury Easterby said: “I think it’s just a rugby incident where Tadhg (Beirne) cleans out someone in front of Antoine Dupont and he gets hit on the back of that. This happens. We definitely have moved away and players have a real awareness now of cleaning out on the lower limb of the player, which would create that type of injury that might happen today, but that wasn’t the case. “He was securing his own ball and not making contact with Dupont and unfortunately that happens. I’ll probably have to look back at it again. We feel like the right decision was made there.” Ireland head coach Simon Easterby: “Disappointing, obviously. We felt like when we went in at half-time 8-6 down, we were well in the game and we were confident that if we started well, which we did in the second half, that we could kick on and make them pay in terms of our fitness and our ability to go well in the second half, which we’ve done in previous games in the tournament. But unfortunately, we probably just didn’t take enough of our opportunities throughout the game in their 22 and vice versa, we conceded too easily ourselves. STATE OF THE NATION Ireland’s pursuit of a third successive victory in the Six Nations is no longer in their hands following their 42-27 defeat to France at the Aviva Stadium. Fabien Galthié‘s side are now two points ahead of Ireland in the table going into the final round of fixtures. On the last day, the French host Scotland at the Stade de France (8.0, Irish time). They have a 93-point advantage over Ireland – they travel to Rome to take on Italy – going into next weekend. A victory of any nature for France against the Scots in their last match would ensure that Ireland could not catch them. At the very least Ireland would need the Scots to win before any mathematics comes into play. The chances of a ‘three-peat’ of wins in the tournament are remote. If teams finish level on points, then the standings are decided by points differential. England can overtake Ireland in the table if they beat Italy with a four try, bonus point at Twickenham in Sunday’s game. They would put England second (15 points) behind France (16) with Ireland (14) in third place. England are away to Wales on the final weekend. The Scots have a four try, bonus point racked up already in the first half of their game with Wales but would go into the final weekend on 11 points. Essentially Ireland are looking for favours from their Celtic brothers Scotland and Wales, while also requiring a win in Rome. What about the lies, damn lies and statistics. Well Ireland had more attacking minutes 16.8 to 15.1, carried for more metres 886 to 744, beat more defenders 21-19 and had more offloads 9-8 while the French made more line-breaks 6-4, fewer handling errors 11-17 and fewer turnovers 7-11. France made 196 tackles and missed 21 while Ireland made 97 and missed 19. France conceded 13 penalties to Ireland’s six. Ireland had two yellow cards. Gerry Thornley’s match report is in. He wrote: “France put Ireland to the sword and utterly obliterated hopes of a Grand Slam, also ending any realistic designs on a historic three-peat next weekend. What’s more, France did so despite losing their talisman early in the piece, so shredding any notion that they might be overly dependent on Antoine Dupont. “Despite one of their battery of backrowers also playing much of the second half in midfield, France’s 7-1 split reaped a rich dividend as their amalgam of power and pace shredded Ireland in the third quarter. Ireland just do not have finishers like the jet-heeled Louis Bielle-Biarrey and Damian Penaud. “Their defence also smashed Ireland in the collisions, and the injection of the Bomb Squad did not dilute this in any way. Their backrow were immense, particularly Paul Boudehent.” You can read the rest of his report here Johnny Watterson’s player ratings are in, three Irish players get seven, the highest mark, one of which is captain, Caelan Doris. Johnny wrote: “The lineout worked and he was a good Irish option there. Made some big tackles, notably on Thomas Ramos in the first half, and ground away in the engine room.” You can read the rest of the ratings here.

He’s been chewing on the top of the red pen. 🗣 "That last 35 minutes is as bad as Ireland have played in some time. It could be damaging for them."🗣 "France played brilliantly!"Rob Kearney and Matt Williams react to Ireland 27-42 France.#IREvFRA | #GuinnessM6N pic.twitter.com/mtcKbmCip6 That was a chastening afternoon for Ireland, the first in a very long time. Forget about the late salvo that yielded 14-points and tries for replacements Cian Healy and Jack Conan. It won’t console players of Irish supporters. The home side received a lesson today in how to ruthlessly finish off opportunities. France did this without captain, Antoine Dupont whom they lost to a knee injury in the first half, centre Pierre-Louis Barassi (HIA) in the second and ended with up replacement and try scorer Oscar Jegou, a flanker playing in the centre. Louis Bielle-Biarrey demonstrated why he is one of the best players in the world with a brace of tries, Damian Penaud’s breakaway effort saw him equal the French try scoring record held by Serge Blanco. French head coach Fabien Galthié‘s decision to opt for a 7-1 split on the bench, despite the injuries to two backs, proved to be a masterstroke as the arrival of the front five pack replacements had a significant impact on the outcome. Fulltime: Ireland 27 France 42 80(+1) CONAN TRY. Prendergast with a quick tap penalty and Conan grabs a second Irish try in three minutes. Prendergast lands the conversion but it’s nothing more than window dressing on the scoreboard. France were stunning for half an hour in the second half, played glorious rugby and were worthy winners. Ireland can and will have no complaints. Ireland 27 France 42 77 mins: TRY HEALY. In his 137th game for Ireland and the final one at the Aviva Stadium, grabs a try. It’s a lovely personal moment. Prendergast converts. Ireland 20 France 42 72 mins: Prendergast with a couple of chips through that he might like over again but Ireland are at least showing character. There accuracy though in the French 22 is seriously lacking. Right on cue Prendergast’s pass six metres from the French line was intercepted by Ramos and he released Penaud who races 75 metres to score under the posts. Ramos converts. Ireland 13 France 42 69 mins: Ireland with a great try scoring chance but Robbie Henshaw steps back inside rather than looking at the man outside. Conor Murray then gets over the line but replacement prop Cyril Baille gets underneath him and denies him a try. Ireland 13 France 35 68 mins: Cian Healy, Rob Herring and Conor Murray are on for Porter, Sheehan and Gibson-Park. 64 mins: RAMOS PENALTY: Doris goes off for a HIA. Van der Flier back on. Prendergast on a wrap around but he tries to take the space and gets collared by Jegou. The pass might have been the better option there. France are utterly dominant. Ireland penalised again at a ruck. Ramos points at the points. Ireland 13 France 35 France have scored 29-points from seven visits to the Ireland 22. France have scored 24 points in second half 12 minutes and claimed a four try bonus point. 58 mins: TRY JEGOU. The impact of the French bench and Ireland going down to 14 players has resulted in the visitors running riot. They’ve been breathtaking in the rugby they’ve played. Ireland 13 France 32 56 mins: Nash is back on, Ireland are back to 15 players. The damage has been done. James Ryan is on for McCarthy. 55 mins: RAMOS PENALTY. A blue tidal wave. France back on the attack and they are within metres of the Irish line when Doris is pinged for playing the nine, Lucu. Alldritt turns to Ramos to kick the penalty and the French fullback duly obliges. Jack Crowley is on for Ireland; he’ll play in the centre. Aki is off. Ireland 13 France 25 48 mins: Nash is in the sin bin under review for his yellow card. Decision is in. It’ll remain a yellow. Barassi is undergoing a HIA. Jack Conan is on for O’Mahony who receives a huge ovation in his last game at the Aviva Stadium. Ryan 49 mins: TRY Bielle-Biarrey. France on a sweeping counter-attack go down the wing where Nash would have been - he’s still in the bin - work the ball wide to Bielle-Biarrey, the wing hits the afterburners, grubbers and wins the footrace. Ramos kicks the conversion. The French make four changes to their pack. Ireland 13 France 22 46 mins: TRY BOUDEHENT. France on penalty advantage power their way forward, winning each collision and eventually, Ireland run out of numbers and Boudehent forces his way over. The visitors were on penalty advantage. The TMO, Ian Tempest, comes in to draw attention to a head collision. Nash receives a yellow card for his head clash on Barassi. They look at an incident in the build-up but Gardner on review says that a clear-out on O’Mahony was legal. He awards the try and Ramos kicks the conversion. Barassi is off for a HIA. Oscar Jegoum, a flanker is on in the midfield. Ireland 13 France 15 Whatever was said by Ireland coach Simon Easterby has worked nicely. Ireland were bright again from the opening whistle. 43 mins: TRY SHEEHAN. Ireland kick the penalty to the corner. Beirne with the take and the Irish maul is well-crafted, moves forward, and then Sheehan breaks off the back and drives through the tackle of Lucu for a fine try. Prendergast lands the touchline conversion, a lovely kick. Ireland 13 France 8 42 mins: Ireland bought a penalty there after sustained pressure, Bielle-Biarrey caught offside. Looked at the Dupont incident. The French scrumhalf was trying to jackal when Tadhg Beirne, propelled by those behind him, looked to clear out legitimately and drove Dupont backwards at an angle. 26mins IRE 0-5 FRAFrance with the opening score of the match as Louis Bielle-Biarrey goes over in the corner following a well-worked line-out.

Ireland dominate the first 20-minutes only to fall to a sucker punch score on virtually the first occasion that France get into their 22. French wing Louis Bielle-Biarrey scores a try for the seventh time in the last seven Tests. Ireland lost Joe McCarthy to a yellow card for a silly pull back on Thomas Ramos. It was during his absence that France scored, the launchpad a lineout maul, where McCarthy’s power was missed. The visitors lost captain Antoine Dupont to what looked like a knee injury, when he was cleared-out at the ruck. Twice subsequently Dupont’s successor as captain, Alldritt, went to match referee Angus Gardner to ask him to get the officials to have a look at the incident. Prendergast, who had earlier hit an upright with a penalty, landed his next opportunity but Ireland then conceded a similiar opportunity, a ridiculously harsh decision. Ramos kicked it but in first half injury time Prendergast landed a monster penalty from the halfway line. Half-time: Ireland 6 France 8 40(+1) mins: Ireland are claiming that there was a head shot on Porter. Referee is unmoved rightly pointing out that if there was it will be called. The home side have a penalty on the halfway line. Prendergast thumps it over. Superb strike. Ireland 6 France 8 35 mins: That’s another questionable decision. Osborne brilliant on kick-chase, nabs Penaud eight metres from the French line. Pierre-Louis Barassi clears Doris out from the side but France get a scrum, knock-on is the ruling. Ireland 3 France 8 35 mins: RAMOS PENALTY: That’s a ridiculous decision. France giving a penalty for alleged interference from kickoff by Andrew Porter. He did nothing to obstruct Damian Penaud. The French wing bought that penalty. Ramos makes not mistake. That’ll stick in the Irish gut. Ireland 3 France 8 33 mins: PRENDERGAST PENALTY: Ireland go on to attack again, get a lucky ricochet from a kick which Nash collects, two rucks later, Henshaw grubbers through on penalty advantage from a tackle off the ball by Paul Boudehent. Prendergast makes no mistake. Ireland 3 France 5 31 mins: Gardner and Doris are having a long dialogue about keeping distance. Alldritt is back to Gardner about the injury that ended Dupont’s participation. The Australian referee is having none of it. Ireland 0 France 5 27 mins: Ireland under pressure again. Referee Angus Gardner is fighting a running battle with Ireland about wishing to speed up lineout and play on. He’s ignoring any injury issues. Then he wants to play on when Dupont is injured. Dupont is gone. France complaining about the clear-out. Alldritt wants him to look at it again. Gardner says that they have and it’s just a rugby collision/injury. Maxime Lucu is on. France now have seven forwards left on the bench. Gamble doesn’t pay off. Bielle-Biarrey with a chip through. He claims that he is tackled late. No one else agrees though. McCarthy is back on the pitch. Ireland get the 22 drop out. Five points conceded in the 22 minutes that McCarthy was off. Ireland 0 France 5 TRY: Bielle-Biarrey. France get their maul going forward and two passes down the short-side send Bielle-Biarrey over in the corner. That comes off Ireland having 70 percent possession. The visitors show them how to be ruthless in the scoring zone. Ramos misses the conversion. Ireland 0 France 5 19 mins: France counterattack, Bielle-Biarrey chips and chases but McCarthy’s actions in pulling back a support player, think it was Thomas Ramos, gets him a yellow card. Silly, silly. France kick to the corner. YELLOW CARD: McCarthy. Ireland 0 France 0 18 mins: Great rip by Osborne but France regain possession only for Doris to win it back. Ireland clear long, France respond in kind before Prendergast finds touch in the French half. Doris is having a huge game. Ireland 0 France 0 14 mins: Ireland attack the short-side through Jamie Osborne, Ireland continue to pummel away inside the French 22, but a knock-on from Joe McCarthy and then a penalty at a ruck allows France to get into the Irish half for the first time. Ireland 0 France 0 13 mins: Good aggressive defence from the French forces Ireland to lose possession which culminates with Dupont racing under the Irish posts but there are two French knocks-on in the build-up. A scrum on the French 22 is the upshot. Ireland 0 France 0 11 mins: France penalised on the double, one for an arm hook at a lineout and the other for offside after a great break from Keenan. Prendergast kicks into the French 22. Peter O’Mahony off the top to Joe McCarthy on the peel, then Doris, then Sheehan, as Ireland inch towards the French line. Brilliant tackle by Louis Bielle-Biarrey on Keenan. 9 mins: Superb work by Doris to win a ruck penalty but Sam Prendergast sees his kick from the French 10-metre line hits the left hand upright. Ireland 0 France 0 7 mins: Superbly direct from Ireland, Josh van der Flier and Aki making some serious yards deep inside French 22 but the visitors win a turnover penalty at a ruck. Gregory Alldritt. 4 mins: First scrum, Ireland put-in. Re-set. Ireland get free-kick for early engagement. Ireland win a penalty after Dupont is penalised for offside. Prendergast kicks into French 22. Tadhg Beirne wins lineout. Dan Sheehan breaks off, grounded short. Dupont offside again and Ireland get a penalty. That’s three penalties and a free kick that France have conceded. Sheehan with a quick tap and Caelan Doris gets held up over the line. Goal-line drop out. Ireland 0 France 0 1 min: Great start for Calvin Nash, super chase and take of Jamison Gibson-Park’s high ball. That’s nice width and change-up from Ireland. Nash involved again but the move peters out with a handling error. Bundee Aki receives treatment after receiving a ball to the face. Ireland 0 France 0 There’s no doubting the emotion of the occasion for several of the Irish line-up, exemplified by Peter O’Mahony and Cian Healy. Time for kickoff. The teams are out for the anthems. 10 minutes to kickoff. There will be a minute’s silence for the former Irish international late Dr Bill Mulcahy. Lowe suffered a back spasm. Ireland’s two first choice wings, Hansen and Lowe miss out. Over to Osborne and Nash. JAMES LOWE IS OUT. CALVIN NASH IN AND WILL WEAR 11 JERSEY. Murray Kinsella caught the on-pitch treatment. Calvin Nash has his bib off and is running on the right wing in the warm-up with Jamie Osborne switching to the left wing. James Lowe seems to be in a fair bit of pain. pic.twitter.com/iLgqOdiaY9 IRELAND INJURY ALERT: James Lowe has just limped down the tunnel. Received treatment to his hip and looks in a lot of discomfort. The French Rugby Federation (FFR) estimate that there are 10,000 French supporters in Dublin although walking around the city there seems to be a great deal more. In the the Six Nations (2000–present), Ireland have played France on 25 occasions, Ireland winning 11, France 12 and two matches have been drawn. One of Ireland’s 50-cappers, Finlay Bealham, gets interviewed. Finlay Bealham chatted Roy about haircuts, food and life in the front row! Thanks to everyone at @IrishRugby for having us.Catch Ireland v France on @RTE2 & @RTEplayer from 1.15pm, Online with @RTEsport and tune in to @RTERadio1. #IrishRugby #TeamOfUs #SixNations #IREvFRA #RTÉ pic.twitter.com/U2Lw2zdUe0 Late tee time Saturday means morning watching Ireland v France 💪🏻☘️ @IrishRugby @SixNationsRugby Antoine Dupont (France): “Ireland have lost very few matches, they have a very rigorous system that we know. They’re (strong) attacking and defending. They have very clear processes that allow them to win matches against all the teams in the world. “They’re doing a very good job - it also pushes us to be at our best level to be able to compete with this kind of team. It will be up to us to be the master of our game, not to make mistakes, not to give the opportunity to the Irish to attack us with penalties. “We know when it’s like that they’re hard to stop. We see all the games played on their defence, they almost always manage to slow down the ball. It’s a very well done job. “We see that they know the laws very well and that they are at the limit of being penalised – they’re not always at the limit, they’re very good at it. “So, it’s up to us to do our best to get fast ball, and if they are at the limit, we hope we’ll do very well. We’ll play fair, but we’re not worried about it.” A word from the captains. Ireland’s Caelan Doris: “We’re very much aware of the threat France pose and the quality they’ve got individually, but what they can do collectively as well. “We’ve seen that with some of the scorelines they’ve put down against some other quality teams, and we’ve experienced it first-hand as well a number of times too so we’re definitely aware that we’re going to need to be at our best. “But there’s excitement to go there and to have our best performance yet. Some of the fixtures against France in the past are up there with my favourite games that I’ve been involved in. “Marseille last year was a special venue to play in, very cool. Thinking back to the Aviva in ‘23, unbelievable atmosphere, very good game. “One of the highest ball-in-play times I think that we’ve had. So, it’s two teams with an attacking mindset and attacking desire, and hopefully it will make for a good watch.” Gerry Thornley had a look at the two best scrumhalves in the world, Jamison Gibson-Park and Antoine Dupont. Here are his thoughts. A bunch of Savoyards I met in Temple Bar. There won’t be a goat milked in the French Alps tonight. #IREvFRA pic.twitter.com/rJqRgbGv5y Romain Ntamack started all five games in France’s most recent Grand Slam (2022) but only once was in the run-on team since then in a Six Nations match, against Wales, the opening game in the tournament a game in which he was sent off. He’s back today following that suspension, partnering Antoine Dupont for the 29th time. Fun fact number one courtesy of Ryle Nugent who’s sitting across from me. Ireland have trailed twice in this season’s Six Nations at half-time, against Wales and England and came back to win both games. If they were to trail against France at the interval this afternoon and win the game, it is the first time to accomplish that in Dublin since 1928. A notable occasion for six Irish players. Peter O’Mahony, Conor Murray and Cian Healy, who are retiring from international rugby at the end of the Guinness Men’s Six Nations, will lead out the teams ahead of today’s game. They will be followed by Caelan Doris, Jack Conan and Finlay Bealham, who are winning their 50th caps. Conor Murray will be accompanied by his nephew, Theo Cooper. I spoke to Ian McKinley, Ian Keatley, Michael Kearney and Paddy ‘Rala’ O’Reilly who know Healy, Murray and O’Mahony. You can read it here. Lets have a look at the teams and officials. IRELAND: Hugo Keenan (UCD RFC/Leinster); Jamie Osborne (Naas RFC/Leinster), Robbie Henshaw (Buccaneers RFC/Leinster), Bundee Aki (Galwegians RFC/Connacht), James Lowe (Leinster); Sam Prendergast (Lansdowne FC/Leinster), Jamison Gibson-Park (Leinster); Andrew Porter (UCD RFC/Leinster), Dan Sheehan (Lansdowne FC/Leinster), Finlay Bealham (Galway Corinthians RFC/Connacht), Joe McCarthy (Dublin University FC/Leinster), Tadhg Beirne (Lansdowne FC/Munster), Peter O’Mahony (Cork Constitution FC/Munster), Josh van der Flier (UCD RFC/Leinster), Caelan Doris (St. Mary’s College RFC/Leinster) (capt). Replacements: Rob Herring (Ballynahinch RFC/Ulster), Cian Healy (Clontarf FC/Leinster), Thomas Clarkson (Blackrock College RFC/Leinster), James Ryan (UCD RFC/Leinster), Jack Conan (Old Belvedere RFC/Leinster), Ryan Baird (Dublin University FC/Leinster), Conor Murray (Garryowen FC/Munster), Jack Crowley (Cork Constitution FC/Munster). FRANCE: Thomas Ramos (Toulouse); Damian Penaud (Bordeaux-Bègles), Pierre-Louis Barassi (Toulouse), Yoram Moefana (Bordeaux-Bègles), Louis Bielle-Biarrey (Bordeaux-Bègles); Romain Ntamack (Toulouse), Antoine Dupont (Toulouse) (capt); Jean-Baptiste Gros (Toulon), Peato Mauvaka (Toulouse), Uini Atonio (La Rochelle), Thibaud Flament (Toulouse), Mickaël Guillard (Lyon), Francois Cros (Toulouse), Paul Boudehent (La Rochelle), Grégory Alldritt (La Rochelle). Replacements: Julien Marchand (Toulouse), Cyril Baille (Toulouse), Dorian Aldegheri (Toulouse), Emmanuel Meafou (Toulouse), Hugo Auradou (Pau), Oscar Jegou (La Rochelle), Anthony Jelonch (Toulouse), Maxime Lucu (Bordeaux-Bègles). Referee: Angus Gardner (Australia) Assistant Referees: Matthew Carley, Christophe Ridley (both England) TMO: Ian Tempest (England) FPRO: Andrew Jackson (England) Speaking of benches, France head coach Fabien Galthié has opted for a 7-1 split with scrumhalf Maxime Lucu the only back listed. Flanker Paul Boudehent has previously played in the centre. The Springboks were pioneers of this strategy, including employing it against Ireland in the World Cup, which Andy Farrell’s side won, again in the final itself and most recently against Scotland in November. France opted for this alignment in the victory over Italy last time out. Where to start? Well maybe a quick look at the teams. Mack Hansen is injured (quad), Garry Ringrose is suspended, Jamie Osborne switches to right wing, Hugo Keenan returns at fullback, Finlay Bealham returns to tighthead while captain, Caelan Doris has shrugged off a knee injury to lead the team. Rob Herring is back on the bench, Jack Conan has recovered from a back injury, while Ireland have opted for a six-two split on the bench with Conor Murray and Jack Crowley the backline cover. The superstars of Ireland and France will need to be at the peak of their powers to claim victory in 'The Dublin Decider' - #IRLFRA @SixNationsRugby @IrishRugby #rtesport @RTE2 @RTEplayer pic.twitter.com/NrrMmZpDlN Salut mes copains and copines to our French readers on this warm-ish, dry-ish Irish afternoon in Dublin. Hello and welcome to the Irish Times rugby blog. John O’Sullivan here, and at no further expense I will be keeping you up to date pre, during, and after Ireland’s seminal Six Nations Championship clash against France at the Aviva Stadium. It’s a mouthwatering clash between two sides that have occupied to the top two placings in the tournament for the past two campaigns. Indeed, France have finished second in four of the last five stagings. The French finished runners up to England in 2020, runners-up to Wales in 2021, won the Grand Chelem – that’s my bilingual nod – in 2022, second to Ireland in 2023, second to Ireland in 2024. Johnny Watterson will be evaluating the Ireland players. He’s got new red and green pens. Gerry Thornley’s match report will be available shortly after the game. Malachy Clerkin will be man-marking Antoine Dupont with a rigour of which the Ireland team would be proud. There is a huge French presence around the Ballsbridge area and the Marseillaise was belted out by a group of 30 as they walked down Lansdowne Road. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Prof Aoife McLysaght: ‘Mum just said, do what you love and the job will follow. Which is very optimistic and brave advice’

Aoife McLysaght recalls how she heard about her first job in genetics. It was the summer after second year in Trinity College Dublin, and she was working in her father’s wholesale nursery in Blackrock, Co Dublin. “Everybody worked there, including me”, starting with filling pots with soil from an early age. “I remember my sister running out into the nursery and going, ‘There’s some professor on the phone for you’.” McLysaght had apparently impressed genetics professor David McConnell in a problem-solving exam, and he offered her a summer research job. Turned out this involved learning about, then designing, a bioinformatics course, using computers to analyse biological information, then a new field. “It became the thing I ended up really loving and working in, basically computational biology.” She’s now evolutionary genetics professor at Trinity. But what tickles her, “the mental connection”, is that that day when her sister ran out, “I was sowing sweet pea”. Peas are critical to genetics. By crossing pea plants, the Austrian scientist Gregor Mendel “basically figured out what genes are, how things are inherited”. While “you can’t unmix paint”, red-flowered and white-flowered parent plants can beget pink, red or white flowers. [ Summer of sweet peas: the struggle is worth itOpens in new window ] This week, ahead of today’s International Women’s Day, An Post launched two new stamps to acknowledge the achievements of women in Stem (science, technology, engineering and maths) and the challenges they face. One features McLysaght; the other has astrophysicist Jocelyn Bell Burnell. In January, McLysaght started her new job as Government science adviser. New science advice structures, department-based – Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science – for the first time, will inform responses to complex and challenging policy issues. It’s a “60 per cent secondment” from Trinity, where she’ll pause teaching and administration but continue research. She’s led a research team there since 2003, managing €5.5m-plus budgets. As a student in 2001 she was part of the international consortium publishing the draft human genome sequence; she was first discovering novel human-specific genes in 2009, identified links between gene duplication patterns and human disease, and has significantly contributed to our understanding of genomes. Based at the department three days a week, at assistant secretary general level, she’s assembling a new national science advice forum of experts to provide advice. Continuing research is important (or “you lose momentum, you lose touch with the field”) and the 60/40 split is considered a good model for government science advisers, so “you retain your independence. You don’t become a civil servant who’s interested in promotion. You’re not in any way incentivised to please the people around you.” Today we’re sitting by the fireplace of Trinity’s gracious Common Room. She gestures to ”Liz” looking down; a portrait of England’s Elizabeth I. This university is her turf since she was an undergrad (graduating in genetics in 1998, PhD in 2002), aside from a postdoc in University of California, Irvine. She’s full of knowledge and enthusiasm, humorous, easy, insightful, likable. She laughs a lot. “I’m the one who never left college.” She grins. Arriving in Trinity, “I felt very quickly I’d found my place”. Genetics’ department culture was and is “very supportive and welcoming of students. We were just treated as people who were earlier in their career. You’d have these really good interactions and conversations with the professors. That’s very motivating.” She describes professors, undergrads, post-grads and post-docs mixing in the building’s atrium, eating lunch, chatting. International science adviser counterparts tell her “the relationships are so important”. She observes “as a scientist or an academic, you might think you’re going to convince people because of this amazing data. You’ll just whip out a graph, and they’ll go, ‘wow, now I see it’. But actually, what’s more likely is you’ll convince them because they trust you”. Having a foot in both civil service and academia is interesting for her. As an academic she’s hired for “the knowledge and discretion and insight to choose” what to teach or research. “In academia, the huge privilege we have is to follow your curiosity.” Civil service involves more procedures “for very, very good reasons”. In this new world, “I’m sitting in on management meetings, business planning meetings, and I’m constantly impressed by the amazing people around me” with vast knowledge, and “very good at knowing how to be effective in getting something done, at reading people, picking up on the slightest things, that I was in the room for but didn’t notice”. The department’s new unit comprises McLysaght and a principal officer. “He’s like my subtitles in every conversation. He’s helping so much in figuring out how to structure things. “I took on this job because I want to do something interesting and meaningful with it, not because I needed to fill my time. I had a full-time job, which I really enjoy. The first line of my application was: I love my job.” A vaccine for cancer. That’s amazing. That some people try to undermine that is depressing Her paternal grandfather, genealogist Edward MacLysaght, died aged 99 when she was 10. She recalls him sitting in the garden, “his beautiful books”, the photo of him with de Valera on the mantelpiece, and his trick holding a coin between his eyebrow and cheek (“we’d roar laughing”). Her grandparents lived in “a little house, basically up the back of the garden in Blackrock” and a relative, barrister Charles Lysaght, told them he’d died, then “rang The Irish Times and RTÉ. Minutes later I heard it on radio. I thought this was normal.” Theirs was not a science family. “I never knew a scientist. I didn’t know you could be a scientist.” But it was her favourite school subject, fuelled by teacher Nick Frewin at Andrew’s in Booterstown. Looking back, she realises, within “the rather constrained Leaving Cert curriculum, he managed to emulate one of the joys of science, which is figuring things out.” She enjoyed genetics, because it involved “understanding principles and figuring things out, rather than remembering stuff. Labelling the parts of the eye. That’s just dull. Genetics was exciting, because it was about ideas and concepts.” She worried about jobs. “My mum just said, do what you love and the job will follow. Which is very optimistic advice, isn’t it, and very brave advice.” These days, talking to school groups, especially girls, “I’m not in the business of persuading anybody to do something they don’t want to do. Science worked for me. It doesn’t mean it’ll work for somebody else. All I want to do is let people know the door is open, if they care to walk through it. That’s all I needed.” There’s a perception she was young to be appointed full professor in 2020. But she was 44, “older than many of my male colleagues”. She was, however, youngish becoming assistant professor at 27; she laughs about managing “to straddle that ambiguity of, is she a student or staff?”. She spells out the startling drop-off of women before reaching academia’s higher levels. Biology doesn’t have the “systemic stereotyping” of maths, but even there, while women comprise 50 per cent of undergraduates right up to postdoctoral research, getting top grades, the percentage of women drops as soon as you get “steady conditions, no longer precarious employment”. She says “too many people thought it was a legacy problem that would fix itself over time. They were kind of passive about it.” She married in her 20s, had her first child at 28, within a year of assistant-professorship, “when I should have been knuckling down and impressing everybody! I didn’t do the correct career thing.” She laughs. “I don’t know if I’d call it a gamble, but I decided, my life decisions and career decisions are separate.” It helped that academic careers are “judged in the round. Are you getting your job done? You organise your own time”. As science adviser, “I don’t want to give the impression I think nobody uses evidence and I’m coming in to save the day.” But she foresees “smaller cultural shifts” in better integrating evidence into decision-making, making it “more habitual”. Climate change has “the most urgency, and the longer we leave it untackled, the more urgent and bigger the challenge.” It’s cross-government: “it’s energy, agriculture, transport, skills and education. All infrastructure.” McLysaght is fascinating company, knowledgeable beyond her speciality and about the bigger picture. She chats away, fired up. “I can keep you here for 10 hours, if you have the time!” We’ve moved and are looking out over Trinity’s Front Square. She talks about her “fortuitous” involvement in the genome project, how “we knew it was something momentous, we were part of the team that was analysing the human genome first”, and the significance of discovering genome duplication in human ancestors 500 million years ago, thus creating “this extra capacity for enormous diversity” and with implications for human health. [ Gene editing opens door to new treatments for inherited retinal diseasesOpens in new window ] McLysaght stresses “scientists are human beings. Of course we can make mistakes. People think scientists know everything. Of course we don’t. We just know a lot about a very narrow thing. People think science is fixed, never changes, but actually we’re always updating it”, what a friend calls “trying to be less wrong than yesterday”. And while scientists can have “reasonable and plausible disagreement”, when there isn’t 100 per cent certainty on detail, “we know the extent of our uncertainty”, and there are “discussions and disagreements, constantly moving closer to the truth. You can categorically say, this is untrue, while not being 100 per cent certain of something else within that.” While this concept can be confusing, it’s important for trust in, and public understanding of, science, she says. The false assertion that vaccines cause autism is a good example. “It’s been thoroughly investigated. It is absolutely not true, thoroughly debunked.” But it “created mistrust in vaccines, which have been extraordinarily powerful in eliminating and controlling very significant childhood diseases.” Australia has eradicated cervical cancer because of HPV uptake. “A vaccine for cancer. That’s amazing. That some people try to undermine that is depressing.” [ ‘Extremely impressive’: melanoma jab trial results excite doctorsOpens in new window ] Talking about science is important, she says, “so people understand how we know things, and what you do when you’re trying to develop new scientific knowledge. You don’t just build something and hope it works. There’s steps and investigation along the way. We are our own first critics. When I’m trying to demonstrate something, the first thing I try to do is disprove it. “What I’m interested in is that things work well, that science is valued as part of decision-making. What I’m not interested in is any kind of personal recognition. It’s more important to me that this thing is done and done well, than anybody getting credit for it. I don’t think I have a big ego. Maybe everybody does somewhat, but it’s not what motivates me.” © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: The great climate deception: How the environmental movement was hijacked by elites

The modern climate change narrative originated with the establishment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 1988. Despite the IPCC's influence on global climate policy, nearly 2,000 scientists and professionals have signed a declaration stating there is no climate emergency. Critics argue that the climate has always been changing due to natural cycles, citing the end of the Little Ice Age in 1850 as an example. They point out that there is no statistical evidence linking global warming to intensifying natural disasters and that the IPCC's models have significantly over-predicted warming. Policies like the UN's Agenda 2030 and the Paris Agreement, aimed at reducing CO2 emissions, are seen as potentially harmful to the global economy, particularly for developing nations. The push for a "green economy" is viewed as a means for central banks and mega-corporations to consolidate wealth and power. The environmental movement, once focused on genuine issues like pollution and deforestation, is portrayed as having been co-opted by powerful elites. Whistleblowers and critics argue that figures with vested interests have used environmentalism as a cover to control the Earth's resources and redistribute global wealth, undermining the original goals of the movement.

Whistleblowers and critics argue that figures with vested interests have used environmentalism as a cover to control the Earth's resources and redistribute global wealth, undermining the original goals of the movement. For decades, the world has been told that human activity, specifically carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, is driving catastrophic climate change. The United Nations has sounded the alarm, warning of impending doom unless drastic measures are taken to reduce CO2 levels. But what if the narrative weâve been fed is not only exaggerated but fundamentally flawed? What if the real environmental movement has been hijacked by powerful interests with ulterior motives? According to a growing chorus of scientists and experts, this is precisely what has happened. According toÂ Mark Keenan, a former scientist, there is ampleÂ evidence and testimony from renowned scientists that there is no âCO2-inducedâ Climate emergencyÂ and he shares some of it in his new book, titled âClimate CO2 Hoax â How Bankers Hijacked the Environment Movement.â The origins of the climate panic The modern climate change narrative can be traced back to the establishment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 1988 by the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). The IPCC was tasked with providing scientific advice on climate change and formulating response strategies. Its first assessment report became the foundation for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which has since shaped global climate policy. However, not everyone agrees with the IPCCâs conclusions. In fact, nearly 2,000 scientists and professionals from over 30 countries have signed a declaration stating that there is no climate emergency and that the UNâs claims about man-made climate change are unfounded. Among these signatories is Marc Morano, a former scientist at the UK Department of Energy and Climate Change and a former staff member at United Nations Environment. Morano argues that while real pollution exists, CO2 is not the problem. Instead, he points to industrial globalization, which has introduced thousands of new chemical compounds, toxins and genetically modified organisms (GMOs) into the environment. The flawed science behind the hysteria One of the key arguments against the mainstream climate narrative is that the climate has always been changing. The geological record shows that Earth has experienced natural cycles of warming and cooling for millions of years. The Little Ice Age, for example, ended as recently as 1850, and the current warming period is part of a natural cycle. According to the Climate Intelligence (CLINTEL) foundation, there is no statistical evidence that global warming is intensifying hurricanes, floods, or droughts. In fact, the world has warmed significantly less than predicted by the IPCCâs models. Dr. Nils-Axel MÃ¶rner, a former chairman of the UN IPCCâs sea level committee, has been particularly vocal in his criticism. âSolar activity is the dominant factor in climate, not CO2,â he stated. âSomething is basically sick in the blame-CO2 hypothesis. It was launched more than 100 years ago, and almost immediately, excellent physicists demonstrated that the hypothesis did not work.â Dr. Mototaka Nakamura, a climate scientist with a doctorate from MIT, has also criticized the data underpinning global warming science. âOur models are mickey-mouse mockeries of the real world,â he said. âGlobal mean temperatures before 1980 are based on untrustworthy data.â The hidden agenda: Control and profit So, if the science is flawed, why has the climate change narrative gained such traction? According to Morano and other critics, the answer lies in the financial and political interests behind the movement. The UNâs Agenda 2030 and the Paris Agreement aim to reduce CO2 emissions by 7% annually until 2030. While this may sound noble, the reality is that such policies would cripple the global economy, particularly in developing nations that rely heavily on fossil fuels. The financialization of the global economy is now based on a ânet-zeroâ greenhouse gas emissions strategy. Central banks and mega-corporations are driving this agenda, with the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) creating the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure (TCFD) in 2015. This task force represents $118 trillion in assets and includes key players like JP Morgan Chase, BlackRock and HSBC. The push for a âgreen economyâ is less about saving the planet and more about consolidating wealth and power. Dr. Otmar Edenhofer, former co-chair of the IPCCâs Working Group III, admitted as much in a 2010 interview. âOne must say clearly that we redistribute de facto the worldâs wealth by climate policy,â he said. âOne has to free oneself from the illusion that international climate policy is environmental policy. This has almost nothing to do with environmental policy anymore.â The hijacking of the environmental movement The environmental movement, once focused on real issues like pollution and deforestation, has been hijacked by powerful elites. Whistleblower George Hunt, who served as an official host at a key environmental meeting in 1987, revealed that figures like David Rockefeller and Baron Edmund de Rothschild were present. According to Hunt, the 1992 UN Earth Summit was less about environmental protection and more about consolidating control over the Earthâs resources. âThe same world order that tricked third-world countries to borrow funds and rack up enormous debtsâ¦ and purposely creating war and debt to bring societies into their control,â Hunt said. âThe world order crowd are not a nice group of people.â A call for real environmentalism The climate change narrative, as promoted by the UN and its allies, is not based on sound science but on flawed models and ulterior motives. The real environmental movement, which once sought to protect the planet from genuine threats, has been subverted by powerful interests seeking to control the global economy. Itâs time to reject the climate hysteria and focus on real solutions to real problems. As Patrick Moore, co-founder of Greenpeace, aptly put it, âThe whole climate crisis is not only fake news, itâs fake science.â The truth is out there, but itâs up to us to seek it out and demand accountability from those who have hijacked the environmental movement for their own gain.

In fact, nearly 2,000 scientists and professionals from over 30 countries have signed a declaration stating that there is no climate emergency and that the UNâs claims about man-made climate change are unfounded. Among these signatories is Marc Morano, a former scientist at the UK Department of Energy and Climate Change and a former staff member at United Nations Environment. Morano argues that while real pollution exists, CO2 is not the problem. Instead, he points to industrial globalization, which has introduced thousands of new chemical compounds, toxins and genetically modified organisms (GMOs) into the environment. The flawed science behind the hysteria One of the key arguments against the mainstream climate narrative is that the climate has always been changing. The geological record shows that Earth has experienced natural cycles of warming and cooling for millions of years. The Little Ice Age, for example, ended as recently as 1850, and the current warming period is part of a natural cycle. According to the Climate Intelligence (CLINTEL) foundation, there is no statistical evidence that global warming is intensifying hurricanes, floods, or droughts. In fact, the world has warmed significantly less than predicted by the IPCCâs models. Dr. Nils-Axel MÃ¶rner, a former chairman of the UN IPCCâs sea level committee, has been particularly vocal in his criticism. âSolar activity is the dominant factor in climate, not CO2,â he stated. âSomething is basically sick in the blame-CO2 hypothesis. It was launched more than 100 years ago, and almost immediately, excellent physicists demonstrated that the hypothesis did not work.â Dr. Mototaka Nakamura, a climate scientist with a doctorate from MIT, has also criticized the data underpinning global warming science. âOur models are mickey-mouse mockeries of the real world,â he said. âGlobal mean temperatures before 1980 are based on untrustworthy data.â The hidden agenda: Control and profit So, if the science is flawed, why has the climate change narrative gained such traction? According to Morano and other critics, the answer lies in the financial and political interests behind the movement. The UNâs Agenda 2030 and the Paris Agreement aim to reduce CO2 emissions by 7% annually until 2030. While this may sound noble, the reality is that such policies would cripple the global economy, particularly in developing nations that rely heavily on fossil fuels. The financialization of the global economy is now based on a ânet-zeroâ greenhouse gas emissions strategy. Central banks and mega-corporations are driving this agenda, with the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) creating the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure (TCFD) in 2015. This task force represents $118 trillion in assets and includes key players like JP Morgan Chase, BlackRock and HSBC. The push for a âgreen economyâ is less about saving the planet and more about consolidating wealth and power. Dr. Otmar Edenhofer, former co-chair of the IPCCâs Working Group III, admitted as much in a 2010 interview. âOne must say clearly that we redistribute de facto the worldâs wealth by climate policy,â he said. âOne has to free oneself from the illusion that international climate policy is environmental policy. This has almost nothing to do with environmental policy anymore.â The hijacking of the environmental movement The environmental movement, once focused on real issues like pollution and deforestation, has been hijacked by powerful elites. Whistleblower George Hunt, who served as an official host at a key environmental meeting in 1987, revealed that figures like David Rockefeller and Baron Edmund de Rothschild were present. According to Hunt, the 1992 UN Earth Summit was less about environmental protection and more about consolidating control over the Earthâs resources. âThe same world order that tricked third-world countries to borrow funds and rack up enormous debtsâ¦ and purposely creating war and debt to bring societies into their control,â Hunt said. âThe world order crowd are not a nice group of people.â A call for real environmentalism The climate change narrative, as promoted by the UN and its allies, is not based on sound science but on flawed models and ulterior motives. The real environmental movement, which once sought to protect the planet from genuine threats, has been subverted by powerful interests seeking to control the global economy. Itâs time to reject the climate hysteria and focus on real solutions to real problems. As Patrick Moore, co-founder of Greenpeace, aptly put it, âThe whole climate crisis is not only fake news, itâs fake science.â The truth is out there, but itâs up to us to seek it out and demand accountability from those who have hijacked the environmental movement for their own gain.

As Patrick Moore, co-founder of Greenpeace, aptly put it, âThe whole climate crisis is not only fake news, itâs fake science.â The truth is out there, but itâs up to us to seek it out and demand accountability from those who have hijacked the environmental movement for their own gain. Sources include: ClimateDepot.com GlobalResearch.ca Amazon.com One of the key arguments against the mainstream climate narrative is that the climate has always been changing. The geological record shows that Earth has experienced natural cycles of warming and cooling for millions of years. The Little Ice Age, for example, ended as recently as 1850, and the current warming period is part of a natural cycle. According to the Climate Intelligence (CLINTEL) foundation, there is no statistical evidence that global warming is intensifying hurricanes, floods, or droughts. In fact, the world has warmed significantly less than predicted by the IPCCâs models. Dr. Nils-Axel MÃ¶rner, a former chairman of the UN IPCCâs sea level committee, has been particularly vocal in his criticism. âSolar activity is the dominant factor in climate, not CO2,â he stated. âSomething is basically sick in the blame-CO2 hypothesis. It was launched more than 100 years ago, and almost immediately, excellent physicists demonstrated that the hypothesis did not work.â Dr. Mototaka Nakamura, a climate scientist with a doctorate from MIT, has also criticized the data underpinning global warming science. âOur models are mickey-mouse mockeries of the real world,â he said. âGlobal mean temperatures before 1980 are based on untrustworthy data.â The hidden agenda: Control and profit So, if the science is flawed, why has the climate change narrative gained such traction? According to Morano and other critics, the answer lies in the financial and political interests behind the movement. The UNâs Agenda 2030 and the Paris Agreement aim to reduce CO2 emissions by 7% annually until 2030. While this may sound noble, the reality is that such policies would cripple the global economy, particularly in developing nations that rely heavily on fossil fuels. The financialization of the global economy is now based on a ânet-zeroâ greenhouse gas emissions strategy. Central banks and mega-corporations are driving this agenda, with the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) creating the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure (TCFD) in 2015. This task force represents $118 trillion in assets and includes key players like JP Morgan Chase, BlackRock and HSBC. The push for a âgreen economyâ is less about saving the planet and more about consolidating wealth and power. Dr. Otmar Edenhofer, former co-chair of the IPCCâs Working Group III, admitted as much in a 2010 interview. âOne must say clearly that we redistribute de facto the worldâs wealth by climate policy,â he said. âOne has to free oneself from the illusion that international climate policy is environmental policy. This has almost nothing to do with environmental policy anymore.â The hijacking of the environmental movement The environmental movement, once focused on real issues like pollution and deforestation, has been hijacked by powerful elites. Whistleblower George Hunt, who served as an official host at a key environmental meeting in 1987, revealed that figures like David Rockefeller and Baron Edmund de Rothschild were present. According to Hunt, the 1992 UN Earth Summit was less about environmental protection and more about consolidating control over the Earthâs resources. âThe same world order that tricked third-world countries to borrow funds and rack up enormous debtsâ¦ and purposely creating war and debt to bring societies into their control,â Hunt said. âThe world order crowd are not a nice group of people.â A call for real environmentalism The climate change narrative, as promoted by the UN and its allies, is not based on sound science but on flawed models and ulterior motives.

According to Hunt, the 1992 UN Earth Summit was less about environmental protection and more about consolidating control over the Earthâs resources. âThe same world order that tricked third-world countries to borrow funds and rack up enormous debtsâ¦ and purposely creating war and debt to bring societies into their control,â Hunt said. âThe world order crowd are not a nice group of people.â A call for real environmentalism The climate change narrative, as promoted by the UN and its allies, is not based on sound science but on flawed models and ulterior motives.

Title: Mayo women winemakers: ‘Everything in life is harder as a woman; you always have to prove yourself a bit more’

From Ballyhaunis, Roisín Curley celebrates 10 years making wine in Burgundy this year. She still works part-time as a pharmacist in the family business. “I have one foot in Burgundy and one in Ballyhaunis” she says. “I love both. I spend August to November in France and visit every month too.” In 2023 she made 14 different wines. “I am a workaholic and I love it.” She says she also has “a spinal cord of loyal close family and friends who help make it happen”. Did she find it difficult as a woman and foreigner to be accepted in Burgundy, a very traditional winemaking region? “I thought it would be a challenge, but everyone has been so nice and so helpful. Being a woman, it is harder. But everything in life is harder as a woman; you always have to prove yourself a little bit more.” Formerly a sommelier in top restaurants straddling three continents, during lockdown Brigid O’Hora moved from Dublin to Achill Island with her young triplets where she began her hugely successful Bridey’s Wine Chats profile on Instagram. Last year her book The Home Sommelier was published. “Our family home is in Achill, so I have been going down there since I was a child. To be honest, I tired of the rat race. We were originally here for six months to save for a house but after three months something in me said ‘no, I’m staying here'.” “I fell pregnant and that’s when I started online. I now work with an importer but I’m still doing my own stuff promoting the book and doing Instagram. It keeps me in touch with everyday people, which is what I love.” Originally from Co Down, Sinéad Cabot moved to Westport 20 years ago. Since then, with her husband Liam, she has been running a firm of wine importers in Mayo, while growing grapes and making critically acclaimed wine in Slovenia. “I’ve worked in wine for 25 years: from retailing to importing to winemaking in Slovenia. I can start the day wearing wellies in the vineyard and end it by wearing high heels at an event presenting our wines. It’s a great life. As well as a certain amount of physicality, winemaking calls for intuition, multitasking and a holistic approach – things we women have in spades.” Like many people, Maureen O’Hara didn’t set out to pursue a career in wine. “The closest connection Killala has with wine is that French ships landed there in 1798. At the last minute, I chose a business degree rather than home economics teacher training. I think part of me wanted to see the bright lights of Dublin. [ ‘She has an amazing nose’: Ireland’s female sommeliers on the changing industryOpens in new window ] “I was a marketing manager for many years. Wine courses gave me confidence dealing with customers and suppliers. In 2010, I set up Premier Wine Training. One aspect I really enjoy is food and wine pairing. My initial love of food and teaching has come together. “I love the fact that wine education empowers people to do their job well. Students have gone on to run wineries, write wine articles, and everything in between. When I set up Premier Wine Training, some were sceptical that I could earn a living from it. Wine education is stronger now than ever. I could do more but would need a suitable partner.” Sinéad Cabot: “A wine that both energises and soothes. A broad palate of preserved lemon with shimmering acidity that finishes with a salty lick which just makes me … well, thirsty.” From The Wine Grove, Castlebar; Daróg Wine Bar, Galway; 64 Wine, Glasthule Brigid O’Hora (coincidentally this was one of my “best value” wines of the year choices): “So mineral, so mouth filling I love it; I adore it.” From Blackrock Cellar; Lilith, D7; Whelehan’s, Loughlinstown; 64 Wine, Glasthule; Green Man, D6; Baggot Street Wines; Pinto, D9; Martin’s, D3; Jus de Vine, Portmarnock Maureen O’Hora: “My favourite wine depends on what I’m eating, but Castelnau de Suduiraut Sauternes, a super ‘second’ wine from a top estate, is a real treat with desserts.” From Celtic Whiskey Shop, D1; The Vintry, D6; McHugh’s, D5 Róisín Curley: “A pure red fruit expression of strawberry and raspberry nuanced with spice and hints of forest floor on the lingering finish. The acidity is bright and fresh, and the tannins are typically silky. It is showing beautifully right now. Each time I have tasted it recently it has been an absolute delight.” From Redmonds, D6; Pinto Wines, D9; Mitchell and Son, D1, D2; Sandycove; Green Man, D6; thenudewineco.ie; Baggot Street Wines; Gibneys, Malahide; Deveney’s, D14; Drinkstore, D7; Eldons, Clonmel; Jus de Vine, Portmarnock; Sweeneys, D3; theallotment.ie Exclusive competitions and restaurant offers, plus reviews, the latest food and drink news, recipes and lots more © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Panama Maritime Authority to Review CK Hutchison-BlackRock Port Deal

Essential news coupled with the finest maritime content sourced from across the globe. Marshall Is. CL YINGDU oil/chemical tanker transits through the Miraflores Locks at the Panama Canal, on the outskirts of Panama City, Panama December 18, 2023. REUTERS/Roberto Cisneros By Elida Moreno and Marianna Parraga PANAMA CITY, March 7 (Reuters) – The Panama Maritime Authority, which oversees shipping and port infrastructure in the country, will request all legal and financial documents from a key transaction between CK Hutchison and a consortium backed by BlackRock, minister to presidency Juan Carlos Orillac said on Friday. U.S. BlackRock announced this week that a group of investors, including Global Infrastructure Partners and Terminal Investment, agreed to buy most of the port business of Hong Kong-based conglomerate CK Hutchison, including its 90% stake in Panama Ports Company, which operates the Balboa and Cristobal terminals under a 25-year concession. The maritime authority is expected to analyze the transaction, which gives control of the two ports strategically located near the Panama Canal to the BlackRock-backed group, at the cabinet’s request, to ensure that public interest in the terminals will be protected, Orillac added in a release. A separate audit of CK Hutchison’s port concession, which was renewed in 2021, is yet to be completed by Panama’s Comptroller General office. The CK Hutchison-BlackRock broad deal involves the Hong-Kong firm’s 80% stake in Hutchison Ports with an equity value of $14.21 billion. However, the conglomerate will receive more than $19 billion following repayment of some shareholder loans. Some U.S. lawmakers have said that CK Hutchison’s control of the Panama ports represents a security risk that might jeopardize the Panama Canal’s operations, backing up President Donald Trump’s threat on taking over the waterway, which was returned by the U.S. to Panama in 1999 under a neutrality treaty. The ports are not part of the canal nor needed for vessels to pass through the interoceanic way, which is mostly used by ships departing from or heading to the U.S. The Panama-owned canal is operated by an autonomous entity, while Panama’s Maritime Authority oversees the ports and Panama’s vessel registry. “My administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal, and we’ve already started doing it,” Trump told the U.S. Congress on Tuesday, following the deal. Panamanian President Jose Raul Mulino said Trump was “once again lying” in a social media post on Wednesday. “The Panama Canal is not in the process of being reclaimed … the Canal is Panamanian and will continue to be Panamanian!” The head of Panama’s business chamber Consejo Empresarial Logistico, Daniel Isaza, said the CK Hutchison-BlackRock deal might encourage the expansion of port infrastructure in Panama. “The administration of the Balboa port opposed the construction of other ports in the Pacific and introduced multiple lawsuits that halted the construction of the Corozal port,” he said. “A new administration capable of making new investments to increase port offer is positive for the country.” (Reporting by Elida Moreno and Marianna ParragaEditing by Marguerita Choy) Join the gCaptain Club for curated content, insider opinions, and vibrant community discussions.

By Sherisse Pham Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing's CK Hutchison Holdings sold its Panama ports business to a group of investors led by BlackRock. What does this episode tell us about Hong Kong today? JUANA SUMMERS, HOST: A Hong Kong company that operates ports on both ends of the Panama Canal said this week that it had agreed to sell its business there. CK Hutchison announced it had a deal with a group of investors led by a U.S. company. The sale looks like a win for President Trump, who has repeatedly stated that he wants the U.S. to reclaim control of the Panama Canal. Reporter Sherisse Pham has more from northwest Hong Kong.SHERISSE PHAM: I'm here at CK Hutchison's Logistics Center in Kwai Tsing Container Port, one of the busiest container ports in the world.(SOUNDBITE OF MACHINERY RUNNING)PHAM: I see miles and miles of goods and shipping containers and trucks. Everything is stacked like LEGO pieces, ready to be boarded on a ship and transported around the world.But this week, the company announced that it's selling the bulk of its ports business to a group of buyers led by BlackRock. Among the assets being sold - two ports operated by CK Hutchison in the Panama Canal that had come under fire by the Trump administration.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: To further enhance our national security, my administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal, and we've already started doing it.(APPLAUSE)PHAM: That was President Trump on Tuesday. He earlier accused China of operating the Panama Canal, an unfounded claim. Beijing called it, quote, "pure lies." CK Hutchison maintains its operations are strictly commercial.The company traces its roots back to when Hong Kong was under British rule. It was founded by billionaire Li Ka-shing, who's now 96 years old. CK Hutchison is a sprawling international conglomerate, operating everything from retail shops to telecommunications.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED NARRATOR #1: Life needs a big network.(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "LEAN ON ME")BILL WITHERS: (Singing) I'll help you...(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)UNIDENTIFIED NARRATOR #1: Three.PHAM: The company had operated ports for decades, but it was an opportune time to exit a business that had come under geopolitical pressure, according to Dan Baker, senior analyst with Morningstar, a U.S. financial services company.DAN BAKER: My view is, if you get a really good price for it, why not?PHAM: Morningstar estimates Hutchison's ports business was worth about $10 billion. The company sold it to the BlackRock group for nearly double that.BAKER: Given there has been, as of just recently, some geopolitical concerns with some of those businesses - particularly the ones in Panama - they're probably worth more in the buyer's hands than they are in Hutchison's hands.PHAM: But George Chen, Hong Kong managing director of the D.C. consulting firm The Asia Group, argues that CK Hutchison's decision to sell the ports business in Panama is a blow to Hong Kong's reputation as an independent financial center.GEORGE CHEN: On one hand, I think it shows, you know, Li Ka-shing - you know, he's a businessman, and he treats this more as a business decision. But on the other hand, I don't think the deal really makes Hong Kong looks good.PHAM: Chen says CK Hutchison striking this deal so quickly indicates Hong Kong companies nowadays really can't afford to get caught up in geopolitical storms. In a statement, a CK Hutchison spokesperson says the deal is, quote, "purely commercial in nature and wholly unrelated to recent political news reports concerning the Panama ports."(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED NARRATOR #2: CK Hutchison enters the dawn of a new season, building on a firm foundation of its past.PHAM: Hong Kong companies like CK Hutchison once had the best of both worlds, operating in a freer financial system separate from Communist China while still having easy access to China's vast markets. But after Beijing imposed a national security law on Hong Kong in 2020, the region has increasingly been lumped together with Mainland China. Even this deal, analysts say, appears to reflect that lack of distinction.CK Hutchison is now selling dozens of ports in more than 20 countries, but it isn't exiting the business entirely. It will continue to own and operate ports in just two territories, Hong Kong and Mainland China.For NPR News, I'm Sherisse Pham in Hong Kong.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) Copyright © 2025 NPR.

Friday, March 7th, 2025 Canadian tariff drama, fears of OPEC+ production returning to markets, Trump’s maximum pressure on Iran, and a US-China trade war – this week seemed to have it all. Oil prices tumbled through the week but then started to recover early on Friday morning. With flattening backwardation prompting the Saudis to cut prices, the initial shock of Trump’s first month is giving way to a more nuanced approach with ICE Brent futures trading around the $71 per barrel mark. Trump Delays Mexico Tariffs for A Month. In contrast to worsening US-Canada relations, the White House has postponed tariffs on most imports from Mexico until 2 April following President Trump’s call with his Mexican peer Claudia Sheinbaum, allowing US refiners to continue their heavy crude imports. Iraq’s Kurdish Dream Has Failed Again. Baghdad’s political push to restart pipeline flows from Kurdish-controlled regions to Turkey’s port of Ceyhan has run aground again, after Iraq’s $16 per barrel price offered to oil companies currently drilling in Kurdistan failed to entice sufficient interest. BlackRock Buys the Panama Canal. US investment giant BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) agreed to buy two major ports on the Panama Canal and ancillary infrastructure from Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison for $22.8 billion, in line with President Trump’s demands that Panama cut Chinese influence at the canal. Chinese Oil Imports Slump as Sanctions Affect Buying. Chinese crude oil imports averaged 10.38 million b/d in January-February 2025, marking a 5% year-over-year decrease, as recent US sanctions on Iranian and Russian tankers disrupted deliveries to the northeastern Shandong province. Venture Global Doubles Down on Plaquemines. US LNG developer Venture Global (NYSE:VG) said it would expand the aggregate production capacity of its 27 mtpa Plaquemines LNG plant in Louisiana to 45 mtpa, eyeing additional 24 trains in the project’s third expansion phase at a cost of 18 billion. Saudi Arabia Drops April Oil Prices. Saudi Aramco (TADAWUL:2222), the world’s largest oil exporter, cut its formula prices for April-loading cargoes into Asia with Arab Light now priced at $3.50 per barrel above Dubai, the first downward move in three months as the market anticipates the unwinding of OPEC+ cuts. US Withdraws from Coal Divestment Alliance. As announced by US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, the United States will withdraw from the International Partners Group, a global coal divestment initiative, leaving South Africa with a more than $1 billion financing gap to decommission coal plants. Copper Soars to 4-Month High. Copper prices gained this week after US President Trump waived carmakers from tariffs and China’s National Congress doubled down on stimulus measures, sending the LME three-month contract to its highest since early November 2024, above $9,700 per metric tonne. Ireland Eyes First LNG Terminal. The government of Ireland has approved a plan to develop an emergency LNG import facility, to be used as a floating strategic gas reserve, less than two years after Dublin rejected an application to build an LNG terminal on climate grounds. Trump Administration Flags $20 Billion SPR Spree. Whilst touring the Plaquemines LNG facility in Louisiana, US Secretary of Energy Chris Wright stated that he plans to seek up to $20 billion in congressional funding to refill the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve, equivalent to 295 million barrels. Defying Trump Fears, Canada Wants More US Pipes. Canada’s midstream giant Enbridge (NYSE:ENB) has allocated $1.4 billion to boost the throughput capacity of its main US-bound oil conduit Mainline by an additional 300,000 b/d over the next three years, with 2024 flows averaging 3.1 million b/d. Indonesia Dreams Up Refining Boost. The government of Indonesia announced its plan to build a new 530,000 b/d refinery at a cost of $12.5 billion, seeking to end a protracted period of import dependence as Jakarta is not being able to cover roughly 40% of oil and 42% of products demand. Russia Plays Down OPEC+ Expectations. Monday’s OPEC+ meeting where output-cutting members reiterated their plans to unwind production curbs from April shed some $3/bbl from oil prices this week, prompting Russian Deputy Prime Minister Novak to state that OPEC+ could reverse the unwinding after April. East African Nations Crave More Drilling. Tanzania announced it would launch its 5th oil and gas licensing round in May, offering 26 exploration blocks most of which would be located offshore in the Indian Ocean, seeking to build on past discoveries that built some 57 Tcf of natural gas reserves.

Title: Corporate NZ is ‘doubling down’ on diversity, equity and inclusion, Global Women’s new CEO says

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. Global Women CEO Katie Bhreatnach. A rollback of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies at Government and corporate institutions in the United States is not deterring the new New Zealand head of the Global Women initiative, nor its corporate partners. “Companies that I get to work with in this role at Global Women, I don’t see them stepping back, I actually see them doubling down,” Katie Bhreatnach told the Herald ahead of International Women’s Day on March 8. “Businesses here understand that inclusion drives performance.” Global Women’s biggest partners included PwC New Zealand, Toyota New Zealand, Air New Zealand, ANZ Bank, Westpac bank, One NZ (formerly Vodafone), Spark, Fletcher Building, Fonterra, Infratil, NZX and KiwiRail among others. “[But,] globally, we’re seeing rolling back of DEI initiatives and most notably in the US.” Bhreatnach said while New Zealand was not immune to global trends, she suggested New Zealanders could choose to follow them or not. “New Zealand’s always had a unique approach, where we’ve got a history of trailblazers, and we’re always trying to drive that change and challenge ourselves to think about how we can do things differently.” She cited US President Donald Trump’s executive order to terminate DEI targets in the federal workforce’s hiring and promoting processes as a move that undermined decades worth of progress. Yesterday New Zealand First introduced a similar bill to “ensure employment decisions in the public service are based on merit and not on forced woke ‘diversity, equity, and inclusion’ targets,” leader and Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters posted on X. “There are some companies [globally] that are using the current context as an opportunity to backtrack,” Bhreatnach said. “We’ve seen companies like the CEO from BlackRock, Larry Fink, go from saying DEI must be embedded into everything, to there being no references to DEI.” Meta, owner of Facebook and Instagram, Alphabet, parent company of Google, Amazon, Goldman Sachs and McDonald’s were reportedly among companies in the US that had reduced or scrapped diversity initiatives. But some companies had maintained their diversity stance, Bhreatnach pointed out. “We’ve also seen attempts from shareholders to get the Apple board to abandon its DEI policies fail. “They [Apple] put a lot of effort into creating a culture of collaboration where those diverse perspectives come together and create the magic. That is the success for their company.” While the Apple shareholder proposal was rejected, CEO Tim Cook did suggest some of the technology company’s policies may require adjustment for legal reasons. “As the legal landscape around this issue evolves, we may need to make some changes to comply, but our north star of dignity and respect for everyone and our work to that end will never waiver,” Cook said at Apple’s annual shareholder meeting last week. Domestically, Bhreatnach was optimistic New Zealand business leaders would follow Cook’s lead. “I think that New Zealand leaders are smart, and they will see that DEI is actually about ensuring talent has the opportunity to thrive. “The businesses I engage with ... they see DEI not as a compliance exercise that takes away from business strategy. Rather, they see it as a strategic advantage.” When asked at what priority level business executives and board members should place DEI, amid their core business, profitability, safety and climate priorities, she said DEI should be considered key. “Having a great culture and talent, and also future talent strategy, I would suggest, is a key pillar for any successful business. “Every organisation I’ve worked in has structured them differently. “What really matters is the commitment to the clarity of your strategy and vision, and the commitment to executing it and driving it forward.” Bhreatnach said organisations she had worked with previously had flexible work policies, pay equity targets and leadership programmes in place. She was a director of the Global Women organisation for two years before becoming its chief executive in January 2025. Her other roles included chair of The Trusts Arena, director of Dunedin Airport and council member at the tertiary education provider Te Wānanga o Aotearoa. “In all those roles I’ve always bought a passion and commitment to uplifting, and accelerating diverse leadership,” she said of her career. “Fundamentally, I want to be a good ancestor, and leave the world in a better place than how I inherited it. “And so all of my roles, I’ve bought a drive to challenge the status quo.” Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read.

Title: Tokenized Assets Soar To $50 Billion—Is $2 Trillion Inevitable?

Time Published: 2025-03-07T13:30:08Z

There is a substantial demand for tokenized bonds and real estate. The market for tokenized assets is rapidly growing, with a value that has surpassed $50 billion. Real estate comprises a substantial portion, with tokenized properties totaling $30 billion. Financial analysts anticipate that this figure will continue to increase, with projections indicating that the market could surpass $2 trillion by 2030. Debt tokenization is also on the rise, particularly in Europe. Deutschland is the pioneer in tokenized bond issuance, accounting for nearly 60% of the total. The European Investment Bank, for instance, issued a €100 million digital bond on Ethereum. With clear regulations in place, European financial institutions seem ready to explore tokenized finance even further. According to Brickken’s recent paper, “RWA Tokenization: Key Trends and 2025 Market Outlook,” the market for tokenized assets of all types has now topped $50 billion, with tokenized real estate accounting for $30 billion of that total. This transition is receiving considerable attention from major financial institutions. BlackRock, Ripple, and Coinbase Asset Management are big names that are entering the space and offering tokenized investment products. Another industry participant, Glasstower, is also expanding its services to accommodate the increasing demand. Tokenization offers advantages that conventional finance cannot replicate. It enables the division of assets into smaller, more affordable units, thereby increasing the accessibility of investing. It also enhances the speed and transparency of transactions by utilizing blockchain networks. This configuration appears to be well-received by investors, and companies are striving to remain competitive. Better regulatory support is one factor contributing to the rapid expansion of tokenized assets. In particular, Europe has implemented regulations that facilitate the operation of institutions in this domain. The legal framework of the European Union has provided financial institutions with the assurance necessary to introduce new products and services that are associated with blockchain technology. In the United States, regulatory discussions are continuing. Some companies are being cautious, waiting for firmer standards before fully committing. Despite this, tokenized funds, real estate, and bonds remain popular among investors seeking innovative methods to hold and build their capital. Many believe that tokenization will become a standard feature of the financial industry, with a projected value of $2 trillion by 2030. More banks, financial institutions, and tech firms are expected to enter the market and offer investors new services. Debt securities and tokenized real estate demonstrate how blockchain technology is revolutionizing the way people invest.

More Info Indonesia has started replacing diesel as a fuel in dozens of power plants with LNG, which is set to boost demand for natural gas in one of the world’s top LNG exporters. Following a decade of delays, Indonesia finally launched a $1.5 billion project to distribute LNG on a small scale to power dozens of plants that currently run on diesel, Reuters reports. PLN EPI, a fuel procurement and transportation operator for Indonesia’s largest power company, PLN, is leading the project. Last year, Japan’s JERA signed a collaboration agreement with PLN EPI to collaborate in LNG procurement, optimization, and the development and operation of LNG receiving terminals in anticipation of growing demand for LNG in Indonesia. By utilizing JERA’s LNG expertise, JERA and PLN EPI will establish an LNG value chain for the power segment in Indonesia, the companies said. The project will need more LNG supply in the future, and could lead to Indonesia turning to LNG imports later this decade, according to estimates reported by Reuters. “We are obliged to provide the LNG ... And we are keen on securing more domestic LNG for the project,” Rakhmad Dewanto, director of fuels and gas at PLN EPI, told Reuters. Early this year, Indonesia reportedly asked its buyers to accept delays to Indonesian LNG cargo exports this year, as the Southeast Asian country looks to meet rising domestic energy and gas demand. Indonesia has one major LNG project planned for later this decade. Japan’s oil and gas producer Inpex owns 65% of the Abadi gas project and plans a final investment decision (FID) for the $20-billion Abadi LNG project by 2027. Abadi LNG has seen years of delays as it has had to change design concepts and then reorganize after supermajor Shell withdrew from the project nearly two years ago. The Abadi LNG project in Indonesia has received interest from potential buyers to purchase gas from the facility in volumes exceeding the facility’s design capacity, according to Inpex.

ByBilly Bambrough ByBilly Bambrough , Senior Contributor. U.S. president Donald Trump has signed an executive order, calling for the establishment of a U.S bitcoin strategic reserve and stockpile of other cryptocurrencies, following through on a campaign promise that some think could push the bitcoin price sharply higher. Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes’ CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" The bitcoin price dipped after it was revealed Trump had signed the order, falling as traders expressed their disappointment it doesn’t commit the U.S. to buying more bitcoin or crypto (and following a “foolish” crypto price warning from Elon Musk). Now, as the bitcoin and crypto market braces for a BlackRock earthquake, traders are scrambling to get ahead of other countries rushing to follow the U.S. into bitcoin—with one analyst predicting a $10 trillion bitcoin market capitalization by 2028. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run U.S. president Donald Trump has signed a flurry of executive orders, including one to establish a ... [+] bitcoin strategic reserve—predicted by some to trigger a bitcoin price boom. "Incredible execution from the Trump administration and a historic moment for bitcoin and crypto," Coinbase chief executive Brian Armstrong posted to X. "I expect many of the G20 to take notice, and eventually follow America’s leadership." The bitcoin reserve "will be capitalized with bitcoin owned by the federal government that was forfeited as part of criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings," David Sacks, Trump's crypto czar, posted to X alongside a video showing Sacks calling the reserve a "digital Fort Knox" and promising it "won't cost taxpayers a dime." Some have speculated that China is weighing creating its own bitcoin reserve to rival the U.S. after Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund revealed last month it’s betting on bitcoin, kicking off a global adoption “race." “There have been rumours about China and South Korea exploring their own bitcoin strategic reserves,” Danny Scott, the chief executive at crypto platform CoinCorner, said in emailed comments. “It goes without saying now that all countries around the world will be paying attention and be looking at how they make their move," adding: "It's going to happen globally." Trump’s bitcoin reserve executive order follows the announcement over the weekend that the U.S. will create a diverse crypto stockpile, cheered by the market as a “game-changer.” “This week’s announcement—as imperfect as it is—marks the first time the U.S. has ever said that bitcoin is a strategic asset,” Bitwise’s chief investment officer Matt Hougan wrote in a blog post. “As long as that stays intact, it feels like a game-changer to me.” Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price shot higher following the election of Donald Trump, with the bitcoin price ... [+] stalling in recent weeks even as analysts double down on their huge bitcoin price predictions. Hougan said other countries would likely be watching the U.S. and considering following suit in creating bitcoin reserves. “If you are Honduras, Mexico, or Guatemala, and you’re watching El Salvador and now the U.S. acquire bitcoin, can you really afford to be at zero?” Hougan asked. “If you’re Dubai, Qatar, or Saudi Arabia, are you comfortable with Abu Dhabi and the U.S. taking the lead? What about Russia? China?” Excitement over a potential global race toward bitcoin adoption has added to expectations of increased crypto regulatory clarity in the U.S. under the Trump administration. "That should add to that medium term, top-side potential, which for me is bitcoin up to $200,000 this year, and $500,000 before Trump leaves office,” Standard Chartered Bank’s Geoffrey Kendrick told CNBC, which would give bitcoin a market capitalization of around $10 trillion.

As I mentioned in the Interim Report for the six months ended 30 June 2024, there has been no change to the Company’s investment strategy, just a larger pool of assets for our Investment Manager, WTW, to manage with the same professionalism that it has brought to the job since April 2017. 1. https://www.theaic.co.uk/aic/news/press-releases/top-20-best-performing-investment-trusts-for-your-isa Investment Performance It was another good year for global equity markets, and your Company delivered strong absolute returns. NAV Total Return was 13.3% and, due to a narrowing of the discount, Share Price Total Return was 14.3%. However, we lagged our benchmark index, the MSCI All Country World Index (‘MSCI ACWI’ or ‘Index’), which returned 19.6%. We also marginally underperformed our peers in the AIC Global Sector, which is disappointing, but we were slightly ahead of the much wider, more representative Morningstar peer group of open and closed-ended global equity funds. Simply put, our relative performance in 2024 suffered from not having enough exposure to the small number of very large companies that dominated market returns, especially in the US. The narrowness of returns from global equity markets has been a common problem for all active managers in recent years, and we take comfort from the fact that, despite this persistent headwind, we are ahead of the Index and have significantly outperformed both peer groups over three years. You can read more about the contributors/detractors to the Company’s investment performance during 2024 in the Investment Manager’s Report on page 9 of the Annual Report. Dividend increased for the 58th consecutive year The Board declared a fourth interim dividend of 6.73p per share on 28 January 2025, resulting in a full year dividend of 26.70p, an increase of 6.0% on the prior year. This fulfils the promise we made at the time of the combination of Alliance Trust and Witan to increase dividends for the legacy shareholders of both companies. 2024’s increase marks the 58th consecutive annual increase, which is one of the longest track records in the investment trust industry. Dividends are well supported by revenue and reserves, and the Board is confident annual dividend increases can continue well into the future. Due to our steady approach, the Company has received a ‘Dividend Hero’ investment company award from the Association of Investment Companies (‘AIC’). Narrowing discount Many investment trusts continued to trade on large discounts to NAV throughout 2024, with the industry average widening to 14.7% from 12.7%.1 I am pleased to report that your Company fared better than most, with its average discount falling to 4.7% from 5.4% over the year. This compared favourably with the average discount for the AIC Global Sector of 7.9%. Your Board remains committed to the maintenance of a stable discount. We will continue to use share buybacks as appropriate and invest in promotional activity to widen our shareholder base, to support the management of the discount. During 2024, the Company bought back 4.7 million shares (1.2% of shares in issue2), versus 8.6 million repurchased in 2023. The shares bought back during the year were placed in Treasury. This level of buybacks was significantly below that of our peers, in a year in which industry-wide buybacks hit a record level of £7.5 billion3. The shares held in Treasury can be reissued by the Company at a premium to estimated NAV when there is market demand. Board changes Following the completion of the combination of Alliance Trust with Witan, we welcomed four new Non-Executive Directors to the Board: Andrew Ross, Rachel Beagles, Shauna Bevan and Jack Perry, all of whom were former directors of Witan. Clare Dobie, having served for almost nine years, is retiring as a Director at the conclusion of this year’s Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’), as is Jack Perry, reducing the size of the Board to eight members. On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank Clare and Jack for their contributions. Annual General Meeting The Board looks forward to being able to meet shareholders again at this year’s AGM, which will be held at the Apex City Quay Hotel in Dundee on 1 May 2025. For those shareholders who are not able to attend in person, we will be live streaming the event. As well as the formal business of the meeting, there will be an investor forum afterwards featuring two of our Stock Pickers, Jennison and EdgePoint, as well as members of WTW’s investment team. There will be another in-person investor forum in London in the autumn. In addition, shareholders can engage with the Company and its Stock Pickers via online presentations during the year. Further details of how to attend all these events can be found on the website. The Board would strongly encourage shareholders to use the opportunity to have their say and use their vote at the AGM. Further information on the arrangements for the AGM, including information on how to vote either directly through the Registrar or though different platforms, is on pages 134 and 135 of the Annual Report. Keep up-to-date In these unusual times, the website will provide timely updates to shareholders. Therefore, I would encourage you to visit the website which contains a vast amount of information on investment performance, details of shareholder meetings and investor forums, monthly factsheets, quarterly newsletters, and Stock Picker updates, as well as the Annual and Interim Reports. As always, the Board welcomes communication from shareholders and I can be contacted through Juniper Partners (‘Juniper’), the Company Secretary at investor@alliancewitan.com. Outlook Since the start of President Trump’s second term of office in January, tariffs have created uncertainty about the outlook for equities. Diplomatic tensions over efforts to end the war in Ukraine and conflict in Gaza have also raised geopolitical risks. Furthermore, European bond markets are adjusting to the prospect of increased borrowing to fund higher levels of defence and infrastructure spending. While there is a risk that heightened levels of uncertainty will impact on business and consumer confidence, global growth and corporate earnings forecasts are currently healthy, giving some grounds for cautious optimism, about further gains for shareholders, especially if there is a broadening out of market leadership. While the Index is highly concentrated, your portfolio has broader exposure to many good businesses that have not yet received the market recognition our Stock Pickers believe they deserve. The portfolio will not always outperform the market in every discrete period, but we believe it will continue to add significant value for shareholders in the long run. I look forward to meeting as many of you as possible at the AGM in Dundee or the next investor forum in London. 1. Weighted average discount (excluding 3i Group). Source: Winterflood. 2.

Dean BuckleyChair6 March 2025 Combination with Witan The most significant development during the year under review was the combination of the Company with Witan. Background Following a comprehensive review of management arrangements, the Witan Board concluded that a combination with the Company was in the best interests of Witan’s shareholders. Amongst other things this allowed them continued exposure to a successful multi-manager approach. The combination was undertaken by way of a scheme of reconstruction and members’ voluntary liquidation of Witan. The scheme required the approval of both the Company and Witan’s shareholders and took effect on 10 October 2024. It resulted in the Company acquiring approximately £1,539 million of net assets from Witan in consideration for the issue of new ordinary shares to Witan shareholders. The name of the Company became Alliance Witan and the stock exchange ticker ALW. Outcome The combination was expected to result in substantial benefits for all shareholders and future investors. The outcomes of the key elements of the proposals include: Portfolio Transition Investment Manager’s Report Market backdrop: equities untroubled by politics For the second year running, global equities delivered strong returns in 2024, with economics trumping politics. Despite a record number of elections, conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine reaching new heights, and a scary moment in Japan when the Nikkei Index of the top 225 blue-chip shares plunged 12% in a day at the beginning of August, investors focused on resilient global growth, falling inflation and interest rates, and healthy corporate profitability. Hence, our benchmark index, the MSCI ACWI, returned 19.6% in 2024 following a return of 15.3% in 2023. Since 1987, the Index has returned an average of 8.4% per annum1, so returns of this magnitude in two consecutive years are rare. The ebullient mood of equity investors was reflected in a surge in the prices of less established assets, such as cryptocurrency, with Bitcoin reaching all-time highs of over $100,000. Peanut the Squirrel Coin, a cryptocurrency named after the eponymous pet that New York environmental authorities seized and euthanised on 30 October 2024, at one point commanded a market cap of $1.7 billion. However, regional equity market performance was mixed. US markets once again led the way, with the S&P 500 delivering a 27% return when measured in British pounds. Chinese equities rallied briefly following government stimulus, but concerns over the country’s property market and trade tensions persisted. Together with a strong US dollar, these worries led to more subdued returns from emerging markets, which rose about 9%. In Japan, August’s technically driven decline proved temporary, and the Nikkei resumed its ascent to close the year at a record high, although the yen’s depreciation reduced returns for UK-based investors when converted into British pounds. The UK and European markets were more muted, with the FTSE All Share Index and the MSCI Europe ex UK Index returning 9.5% and 1.9% respectively. Gains driven by US tech giants Giant US technology related stocks were the standout performers, fuelled by investor excitement about generative artificial intelligence (‘AI’) and, from November onwards, hopes that Donald Trump’s victory in the presidential election would weaken regulatory scrutiny. The share prices of the so called “Magnificent Seven” – Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, NVIDIA and Tesla – increased by 60% on average and were responsible for 43% of MSCI ACWI’s gains. This was less than 2023 when they contributed 53%, but still a huge number emphasising the extreme concentration of index returns in a small number of companies. Even so, from mid-year onwards, returns were no longer quite as skewed to the performance of a handful of shares. Although NVIDIA and Tesla returned a massive 176% and 65% respectively, giant tech was not the only game in town. Financial stocks returned 26.5%, and returns from the consumer discretionary, industrial and utility sectors were also well into double figures, pointing to the potential broadening out of market returns as stock-specific drivers came to the fore. 1. https://www.msci.com/documents/10199/8d97d244-4685-4200-a24c-3e2942e3adeb Portfolio performance: strong absolute gains but lagged benchmark index Our portfolio’s NAV Total Return was a robust 13.3% but, as with most active managers, it lagged the Company’s benchmark index. The portfolio does, however, remain ahead of the Index over three years (28.0% vs 26.8%), albeit behind over five years (64.7% vs 70.8%). Disappointing though it was not to beat the MSCI ACWI in 2024, we were not alone. AJ Bell calculated that, to the end of November, just 18% of active global equity funds outperformed their passive peers, largely due to their inability to match high Index weightings in the “Magnificent Seven”. The sheer size of these companies in the Index is mind boggling. NVIDIA, Microsoft and Apple, for example, represent 13% of the MSCI ACWI as at 31 December 2024 and, together, are bigger than the entire stock markets of several sizeable countries. The skew of the Index towards mega-cap companies has been a challenge, to varying degrees, since the start of our multi-manager strategy in April 2017. As a broadly diversified strategy, with capital spread between 8-12 Managers, all with different approaches to investing, our portfolio naturally has a structural bias away from stocks that on rare occasions represent such a large proportion of our global benchmark. While we have some exposure to most of the “Magnificent Seven”, it would require a lot of the Managers to choose them as one of their best ideas for us to be at Index weight, never mind be overweight. The Index may have been hard to beat in recent years, but market concentration poses significant risks for passive strategies. At the end of 2024, the Index on average allocated around 150 times as much capital to each of Apple, NVIDIA and Microsoft as it did to the average stock, akin to us placing about 95% of the portfolio in one manager’s hands and 0.5% each in the other ten. We do not believe this is the right way to manage risk for shareholders, bearing in mind that index trackers are not investing lots of money in these companies because they are good businesses trading at good valuations, but because they are very big. If US large-cap stocks continue to dominate, tracker funds may continue to outperform active funds. But if sentiment on the technology sector turns sour, passive funds with big stakes will be hit much harder. Not owning enough NVIDIA was painful The strong outperformance of our portfolio versus our benchmark in 2023 continued into the first quarter of 2024, when the biggest contribution came from not owning, at that time, poorly performing Tesla and Apple. But thereafter stock selection became more challenging, particularly within the “Magnificent Seven”. Although we benefitted from owning Amazon and Microsoft, we moved from an overweight to an underweight position in NVIDIA in the first quarter after its extraordinary outperformance, which then made it our biggest single detractor last year as that outperformance continued. Having helped us in the first quarter, the lack of exposure to Tesla and Apple, which both recovered strongly as the year progressed, counted against us from then on. Overall, our positions in the “Magnificent Seven” accounted for a third of the portfolio’s underperformance versus the Index in 2024. The remainder of the portfolio’s underperformance came from a combination of being underweight in large-cap stocks in general and stock specific issues elsewhere, in some cases due to partial reversals of performance in 2023. For example, stock selection in financials detracted in large part due to our relative lack of exposure to strongly performing US banks such as JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs. In the consumer discretionary sector, the share price of UK-based drinks company Diageo, owned by Veritas Asset Management (‘Veritas’) and Metropolis Capital (‘Metropolis’), continued to suffer from a post-Covid cyclical downturn, falling 8.5%, although both Managers believe the company will eventually recover lost ground when structural trends reassert themselves. Novo Nordisk, the Danish weight loss drugs company, was another notable detractor, as its shares fell 14% after disappointing test results. Our Stock Pickers see this as a temporary decline in a growing market in which Novo Nordisk has a leading position. Hence, it was one of our biggest purchases in 2024 (see table below). Indeed, our Stock Pickers express a high degree of confidence in the latent value of many of their holdings. By far the most important long run ingredient underpinning share price performance is strong fundamentals, such as market-leading products or services, solid profit margins, plentiful cashflow and strong management. Top 10 purchases and sales Source: Juniper. The purchases and sales are calculated by taking the net value of all transactions (buy and sells) for each holding held within the portfolio over the period. The tables exclude any non-equity holdings such as ETFs and any transfers from the combination with Witan. Even so, in the short run, market sentiment can have a larger impact on share prices than fundamentals. When we break down the portfolio performance against the Index into fundamentals and sentiment, the portfolio’s strong absolute performance has been mainly as a result of company fundamentals, whereas the Index’s absolute performance has been more driven by market sentiment. A full breakdown of the contributors to our Total Return in 2024 is shown in the following table. Contribution analysis Source: Performance and attribution data sourced from WTW, Juniper, MSCI Inc, FactSet and Morningstar as at 31 December 2024. Percentages may not add due to rounding. In the table below, we also list the top five contributors and detractors to portfolio performance during the year relative to the portfolio’s benchmark. Sands, Vulcan and Lyrical were the top performers As we would expect from such a diverse line up, performance among our Managers was mixed. This is by design, as we do not want the portfolio to be biased towards any one approach of investing, which might make returns vulnerable to a sudden switch from one style to another. This happened in 2022 when growth stocks began to suffer significantly as central banks raised interest rates to combat inflation. Sands Capital (‘Sands’), Vulcan Value Partners (‘Vulcan’), and Lyrical Asset Management (‘Lyrical’) were the top performers last year. Sands and Vulcan both benefitted from owning tech giants. Sands held NVIDIA while Vulcan held Amazon, but Sands’ largest contributor to relative performance was Axon Enterprise, an industrial business which makes tasers, body cameras and other software products. Its share price surged by 134% last year. Top five stock contributors to performance Bottom five stock detractors to performance Source: WTW. The tables above illustrate the top five contributors and detractors to returns relative to benchmark in 2024. It aims to explain at a stock level which companies drove relative returns. For example, the Alliance Witan portfolio was underweight relative to benchmark in NVIDIA, Broadcom, Tesla and Apple. These stocks had very strong returns, which hurt our portfolio’s relative performance. Conversely, not having an exposure to Nestle helped our relative performance given the stock was held in the benchmark and was down over the year. Our overweight position in Amazon, Axon Enterprise, Salesforce and NRG Energy contributed positively to relative returns given their strong performance. The average active weight is the arithmetic simple average weight of the stock in the portfolio minus the arithmetic simple average weight of the stock in the benchmark over the period. Vulcan’s largest contributor to our performance was KKR, the US-based private equity group, which returned 82%, prompting Vulcan to take profits. Its holding in Salesforce also did well, rising nearly 30%. Lyrical, a deep-value style investor, benefitted from owning several less talked-about US-based companies, which all rebounded from cheap valuations. These included NRG Energy, Ameriprise Financials and eBay. Of our Managers, the most notable laggard was Sustainable Growth Advisors (‘SGA’), which was disappointing given its focus on large cap growth stocks which, as a group, had the strongest price momentum. SGA suffered from holding Novo Nordisk, and two of its other positions, ICON and Synopsys also stood out as detractors. The recent poor performance of SGA follows a long period of outperformance, so returns since we appointed SGA remain strong. Value Managers Metropolis and ARGA Investment Management (‘ARGA’), the latter replacing Jupiter Asset Management (‘Jupiter’) in April, also struggled in the recent market environment, which has generally favoured growth managers. Portfolio changes: two new Managers added after combination with Witan As well as adding ARGA for Jupiter in the first half of the year, following Ben Whitmore’s decision to leave Jupiter to set up his own business, there were two further changes to the Manager line-up during the integration of Witan’s portfolio. Altogether, this contributed to an unusually high level of turnover of 98.5% of the portfolio in 2024. Both Alliance Trust and Witan already had GQG Partners (‘GQG’) and Veritas in common, which meant that there were some in-specie transfers of stocks. Additionally, the combination of Alliance and Witan presented us with an opportunity to introduce Jennison Associates (‘Jennison’) to the portfolio at a low cost. Based in the US, Jennison specialises in investing in innovative, fast-growing businesses. It had been one of Witan’s most successful managers and blending it with our other Managers increased the diversity of holdings in growth companies. We also took the opportunity to replace Black Creek Investment Management (‘Black Creek’) with EdgePoint Investment Group (‘EdgePoint’), while we were using a transition manager to keep costs down to a minimum. This change was prompted by succession planning at Black Creek. We had been monitoring Black Creek for some time due to the departure of a senior team member for health reasons and the uncertainty surrounding the timing of founder Bill Kanko’s retirement. With a similar investment style to Black Creek, EdgePoint seeks to buy good, undervalued businesses and hold them until the market fully realises their potential. Through the combination, we inherited a small number of investment trust and private equity fund holdings, representing less than 3% of the combined portfolio. These are specialist funds with portfolios focused on, among other things, early-stage life sciences, valuable intellectual property, innovative internet platforms and renewable infrastructure assets. Collective investments such as these are not normally part of our investment strategy. However, they are all trading at prices we believe are well below their intrinsic value, so rather than sell them at a loss, we will hold them until we can achieve attractive values. Beyond that, the combination did not lead to any change in our investment approach. We retain high conviction in our line-up of Managers and their ability to pick winning stocks, although we keep them under constant review for any red flags and have access to a deep bench of talented replacements should these be needed. Gearing: remaining cautious Our gross gearing stood at 8.4% at the end of 2024 (4.9% net of underlying Manager and central cash), slightly above the level of 7.1% at the start of the year, reflecting the improving outlook for equities as the year progressed. However, given the strong performance from equity markets, it is still towards the lower end of the typical range of 7.5 to 12.5%. Market outlook: multiple risks warrant diversification As 2025 began, the mood among investors was upbeat, with many hoping President Trump’s promises of deregulation and tax cuts would be supportive of equity markets. If returns can spread beyond a narrow group of highly valued US mega-cap technology stocks, it could provide firmer foundations for another good year for shares. The strong start to the year for European equities certainly offered hope for geographical diversification. However, on-off tariffs and geopolitical tensions loom large, creating considerable uncertainty. This was reflected in an increase in equity market volatility in February. In the first 2 months of 2025, the benchmark index rose by 2.2% suggesting that investors were still willing to look through some of the risks while forecast global growth and corporate earnings remain healthy. But confidence is fragile and, with valuations in the US still close to a record high despite February’s pullback, the market is vulnerable to setbacks. In this environment, we believe bottom-up stock picking, based on company fundamentals, should be a more reliable way to add value for shareholders in the long term than making bold, top-down market calls. So, we will continue to position the portfolio to maintain balanced regional, sector and style exposures, that are similar to the Index weightings by periodically adjusting Manager allocations. This should provide stability and reduce risk, while we rely on our Managers to add value by seeking out the best companies in each market segment. While retaining some exposure to US mega-cap tech stocks that may continue delivering attractive returns, our portfolio is not reliant on them. It also contains many stocks that have remained in the shadows but have been performing well operationally and have excellent prospects not yet reflected in their share prices. Hidden gems: stock picks with high potential We asked our eleven Stock Pickers for examples of strong but underappreciated companies in the portfolio Lyrical highlighted five of its US holdings that have underperformed the S&P 500 Index since the start of 2024 but, at the same time, have grown their forecast earnings per share by more than the Index. These are healthcare providers Cigna and HCA, WEX and Global Payments, which both provide business-to-business payment technology, and Gen Digital, which is a leading provider of cyber security and identity protection. “Interestingly, even on this list there is inconsistency by the market,” says Lyrical. “Cigna has the worst stock performance, but the second-best earnings per share (‘EPS’) growth. Gen Digital has the slowest EPS growth in the group, but the best performance”. ARGA cited Accor, the global hotel business, which has transitioned to an “asset light” business model by selling most of its hotels, while maintaining the lucrative franchise and management agreements attached to these properties. While Sands Capital sees potential in the share prices of Sika, a maintenance and building refurbishment specialist. “Investment results have been weak despite solid fundamental results,” says Sands. “We believe that investors have focused on slower than historical organic growth, caused by several factors, including the real estate crisis in China, slowdown in electric vehicle production, and a pause in green building incentives.” Sands Capital also mentioned Roper Technologies, a diversified industrial technology company, and Keyence, a leading designer of high-end factory automation based in Japan, as attractive businesses with share price appreciation potential. Vulcan highlighted CoStar Group, an information provider to the commercial and residential real estate industries, and Everest Group, a global insurance and reinsurance business, while GQG mentioned the UK-based pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca, the Brazil-based oil and gas company Petrobras, Bank Mandiri in Indonesia, and the Indian tobacco company ITC. SGA backed Danaher, the US industrial group, Intuit, which provides do-it-yourself accounting software for small businesses, and HDFC Bank in India. Jennison highlighted Reddit, the online social media platform. “Reddit is targeting 49% growth in the third quarter of 2024 and consensus is at 41% in Q4, but then market estimates are fading down to around 20% in 2025, which we think is overly conservative and creates an opportunity for investment today.” Veritas’s nominations for underappreciated businesses were Amadeus, the Spanish software company focusing on air travel, The Cooper Companies, which makes contact lenses, and Thermo Fisher Scientific, the world’s largest scientific equipment provider. Japan specialist Dalton’s best stocks included Bandai Namco, a multinational that publishes video games and makes toys, Shimano, the bicycle equipment manufacturer, and Rinnai, one of the global leaders in water heaters. Metropolis highlighted Andritz, the Austrian headquartered business supplying industrial equipment to the pulp and paper, metals and hydropower industries, Crown Holdings, which makes aluminium drinks cans, and Admiral, the UK insurer. Finally, EdgePoint, the newest addition to our Manager line-up, pointed to Dayforce, a global human resources software company, Nippon Paints Holdings in Japan, Franco-Nevada, a gold-focused royalty company in Canada, and Qualcomm, which invented significant pieces of the underlying technology required for mobile phones. “The market looks at Qualcomm as a handset supplier and the stock moves in relation to expected handset sales over the following quarters,” says EdgePoint. “We consider Qualcomm to be one of the world’s leading designers of energy-efficient processors at a point in time when demand for energy-efficient processing is growing rapidly across a wide range of industries. Some of the major opportunities for Qualcomm over the next 5 years include artificial intelligence, automobiles, personal computers and smartphones.” Altogether, these fundamentally strong businesses combine with others to create a robust, multi-manager portfolio that offers attractive long-term growth with lower risk than a single manager strategy, and therefore a more comfortable ride through the ups and downs of the market. Such companies may have remained below the radar in 2024, when investors became giddy with the stellar returns from the US technology shares, but we look forward to their attributes receiving the recognition from the market that they deserve.

Dividend We have paid our shareholders a rising dividend for 58 consecutive years. Providing that level of reliability is something of which we are extremely proud. We carefully manage the Company’s dividend. For instance, should there be a year in which income is unexpectedly high, we may retain some of that income to help fund future dividends. Due to our steady approach, the Company has received a ‘Dividend Hero’ investment company award from the Association of Investment Companies (‘AIC’). Our dividend policy Subject to market conditions and the Company’s performance, financial position and outlook, the Board will seek to pay a dividend that increases year on year. The Company expects to pay four interim dividends per year, on or around the last day of June, September, December and March, and will not, generally, pay a final dividend for a particular financial year. While shareholders are not asked to approve a final dividend, given the timing of the payment of the quarterly payments, each year they are given the opportunity to share their views when they are asked to approve the Company’s Dividend Policy. Fourth interim dividend As previously announced, a fourth interim dividend of 6.73p per ordinary share will be paid on 31 March 2025 to those shareholders who were on the register at close of business on 28 February 2025. Increased dividend The Company has increased its total dividend for the year ended 31 December 2024 to 26.7p per ordinary share (2023: 25.2p), a 6.0% increase on the previous year. Reserves It is the Board’s intention to utilise distributable reserves as well as portfolio income to fund dividend payments. Further details of the dividend payments for the year to 31 December 2024 and information on distributable reserves can be found in notes 7 and 2(b)(x) of the Financial Statements, respectively. Ongoing Charges and Discount Ongoing charges1 The Company’s ongoing charges ratio (‘OCR’) decreased to 0.56% (including the impact of the investment management fee waiver) (2023: 0.62%). Total administrative expenses were £3.9m (2023: £2.9m) and investment management expenses were £18.4m (2023: £16.3m). Further details of the Company’s expenses are provided in note 4 of the Financial Statements on page 90 of the Annual Report. The Company’s costs remain competitive for an actively managed multi-manager global equity strategy. Maintaining a stable discount1 One of the Company’s strategic objectives is to maintain a stable share price discount to NAV. The Company has the authority to buy back its own shares in the market if the discount is widening and to hold these shares in Treasury. During the year under review, the Company’s share price traded at an average discount of 4.7% (2023: 6.0%). As at 31 December 2024, the Company’s share price discount was 4.7% (2023: 5.4%). The average discount (unweighted) for the AIC Global Sector was 7.9%. Share issuance and buybacks As a result of the combination with Witan, 120,949,382 new ordinary shares were issued for assets valued at £1.5bn implying an effective issue price of £12.7459246 per share. The Company bought back 1.2%* (2023: 3.0%) of its issued share capital during the year, purchasing 4,722,000 shares which were placed in Treasury. The total cost of the share buybacks was £57.0m (2023: £86.6m). The weighted average discount of shares bought back in the year was 5.7%. Share buybacks contributed a total of 0.1% to the Company’s NAV performance in the year. 1.

What We Do How WTW manages the portfolio WTW as Investment Manager has overall responsibility for managing the Company’s portfolio. It is the Investment Manager’s job to select a diverse team of expert Stock Pickers, each of whom invest in a customised selection of 10-20 of their ‘best ideas’. WTW then allocates capital to them, relative to the risks the Stock Picker represents. For example, small-cap stocks are typically more risky than large-cap stocks, so on average a small-cap specialist would tend to receive less capital than a Stock Picker who focuses on large-cap stocks. However, the allocations do not remain static; WTW keeps them under constant review and varies them over time according to market conditions, with the goal of keeping our exposures to different parts of global stocks markets well balanced. Stock Pickers are encouraged to ignore the benchmark and only buy a small number of stocks in which they have strong conviction, while WTW manages risk through the Stock Picker allocations. On their own, each of the Stock Picker’s high-conviction mandates has the potential to perform well. This is supported by WTW’s experience of managing high-conviction portfolios and academic evidence1. But concentrated selections of stocks can be volatile and risky, so WTW mitigates these dangers by blending Stock Pickers with complementary investment approaches or styles, which can be expected to perform differently in different market conditions. This smooths out the peaks and troughs of performance associated with concentrated single-manager strategies. Several of the Stock Pickers in the current portfolio have been with the Investment Manager since inception of the multi-manager strategy, though it does actively monitor and rearrange the line-up where necessary. WTW invests a lot of time and effort on identifying skilled Stock Pickers for the Company’s portfolio, undertaking extensive qualitative and quantitative analysis. This due diligence process focuses on: 1. Sebastian & Attaluri, Conviction in Equity Investing, The Journal of Portfolio Management, Summer 2014. The Investment Manager’s views are formed over extended periods from multiple interactions with the Managers, including regular meetings. They look beyond past performance numbers to try to understand the ‘competitive edge’. This involves examining and interrogating processes for selecting stocks, adherence to this process through different market conditions, team dynamics, training and experience. Performance track records are just a single data point, and, without the context of the additional information, they are unlikely to persuade WTW that a Stock Picker is skilled. Once selected, the Investment Manager tends to form long-term partnerships with the Stock Pickers, generally only taking them out of the portfolio if something fundamental changes, such as the departure of a key individual from the business or a change in business strategy or fortunes. With highly active, concentrated portfolios, periods of short-term underperformance are to be expected and are not a reason to doubt a Stock Picker if they are adhering to their philosophy and process. WTW does, however, keep a constant eye out for talent and may bring new Managers into the portfolio at the expense of an incumbent if they are a better fit. Responsible investment WTW believes that Environmental, Social and Governance (‘ESG’) factors have the potential to impact financial risk and return. As long-term investors, WTW aims to incorporate these factors into its investment process. As stewards of the Company’s assets, WTW seeks to integrate responsible investment into its process for managing the portfolio. ESG factors can influence returns, so these risk factors are taken into account in WTW’s investment processes, including assessing how Managers evaluate ESG risk in their decisions over what stocks to purchase. Climate change poses potential significant risks to investment returns from many companies, which is why both WTW and the Company have stated an intention to manage the assets with a goal of achieving Net Zero greenhouse gas emissions from the portfolio by 2050, with an interim intention of reducing portfolio emissions by approximately 50% by 2030, relative to 2019. In 2024, we saw an increase in the portfolio’s weighted average carbon intensity (which measures carbon emissions as a proportion of revenue) from 71.9tCO2e/$M sales to 117. 9tCO2e/$M sales. Over the year, some higher-emitting stocks came into the portfolio including, industrial company Alaska Air and materials company Alcoa Ord, and our allocation to the higher-emitting Utilities sector went up slightly with purchases of companies such as Southern Ord and American Electric Power. We are monitoring our progress against our Net Zero goal, and our Managers and EOS at Federated Hermes (‘EOS’) continue to engage with the companies in the portfolio on climate related issues. Progress towards Net Zero will not be linear. Emissions from the portfolio are dependent on holdings, which can change from year to year as WTW’s Stock Pickers seek value for investors. If companies are perceived as being at higher financial risk by being slow to adapt to a Net Zero world, we expect to use stewardship, such as voting and engagement, to encourage positive changes to business practices. WTW believes this is preferable to excluding companies from the portfolio, since exclusion merely passes the responsibility of ownership to other investors who may be less scrupulous about adherence to ESG standards or regulation. As well as engaging with companies on climate change, WTW’s Stock Pickers, together with stewardship provider EOS, focused on a wide range of other issues last year. Overall, EOS engaged with 97 companies in the portfolio on 515 issues and objectives throughout the year. Key areas of engagement included board effectiveness, climate change, human and labour rights and human capital, biodiversity, digital rights and AI. Of these engagements, the environmental category accounted for 29% of the total number of engagements, with 63% of environmental engagements relating to climate change. Meanwhile the Stock Pickers cast votes at 3,346 resolutions in 2024. Of these resolutions, they voted against company management on 386 and abstained from voting on 38 occasions. How We Manage Our Risks In order to monitor and manage risks facing the Company, the Board maintains and regularly reviews a risk register and heat map. The risk register details all principal and emerging risks thought to face the Company at any given time. The principal risks facing the Company, as determined by the Board, are Investment, Operational and Legal and Regulatory Non-Compliance. As part of its review process, the Board considers input on the principal and emerging risks facing the Company from its key service providers WTW and Juniper. Any risks and their associated risk ratings are then discussed, and the risk register and heat map updated accordingly, with additional measures put in place to monitor, manage and mitigate risks as required. During the period the Board carefully reviewed the risks associated with the implementation of the combination and the post transaction integration risks. Principal risks The principal risks facing the Company, how they have changed during the year and how the Board aims to monitor and manage these risks are detailed below. Emerging risks Emerging risks are typified by having a high degree of uncertainty and may result from sudden events, new potential trends or changing specific risks where the impact and probable effect is hard to assess. As the assessment becomes clearer, the risk may be added to the risk matrix of ‘known’ risks. The Board is currently monitoring a number of emerging risks: geopolitical tension continues to be an emerging risk for the Company due to ongoing conflicts across the world. Along with increased populism and nationalism, these risks may impact individual economies and global markets. Although covered in the operational risk section above, the Board recognises the increased risk that cybercrime and the misuse of AI poses to the Company. Geopolitical events such as the conflicts in the Middle East region, coupled with the potential breakdown of post war alliances and potential new trade tariffs and changes to US economic and international policies introduced by President Trump, could bring uncertainty and fragility to capital markets in 2025, including persistent or reacceleration of inflationary pressures. Stakeholder Engagement – Section 172 Statement The Directors have a number of obligations including those under section 172 of the Companies Act 2006. These obligations relate to how the Board takes account of various factors in making its decisions – including the impact of its decisions on key stakeholders. The Board is focused on the Company’s performance and its responsibilities to stakeholders, corporate culture and diversity, as well as its contributions to wider society, and it takes account of stakeholder interests when making decisions on behalf of the Company. As an externally-managed investment trust, the Board considers the Company’s key stakeholders to be existing and potential new shareholders and its service providers. Full details on the primary ways in which the Board engaged with the Company’s key stakeholders can be found on pages 30 to 35 of the Annual Report. Dean BuckleyChair6 March 2025 Viability and Going Concern Statements Viability Statement The Board has assessed the prospects and viability of the Company beyond the 12 months required by the Going Concern accounting provisions. The Board considered the current position of the Company and its prospects, strategy and planning process as well as its principal and emerging risks in the current, medium and long term, as set out on pages 27 to 29 of the Annual Report. After the year-end but prior to approval of these Accounts, the Board reviewed its performance against its strategic objectives and its management of the principal and emerging risks facing the Company. The Board received regular updates on performance and other factors that could impact on the viability of the Company. The Board has concluded that there is a reasonable expectation that the Company will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due for at least the next five years; the Board expects this position to continue over many more years to come. The Company’s Investment Objective, which was approved by shareholders in April 2019, is to deliver a real return over the long term, through a combination of capital growth and a rising dividend, and the Board regards the Company’s shares as a long-term investment. The Board believes that a period of five years is considered a reasonable period for investment in equities and is appropriate for the composition of the Company’s portfolio. In arriving at this conclusion, the Board considered: Going Concern Statement In view of the conclusions drawn in the foregoing Viability Statements, which considered the resources of the Company over the next 12 months and beyond, the Directors believe that the Company has adequate financial resources to continue in existence for at least the period to 31 March 2026. Therefore, the Directors believe that it is appropriate to continue to adopt the Going Concern basis in preparing the financial statements. Directors’ Responsibilities The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the Financial Statements in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards and applicable law and regulations. Company law requires the Directors to prepare Financial Statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors are required to prepare the Financial Statements in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards. Under company law the Directors must not approve the Financial Statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss for that period. In preparing these Financial Statements, the Directors are required to: The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s transactions, and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that the Financial Statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. The Directors are responsible for ensuring that the Annual Report and Financial Statements, taken as a whole, are fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s position, performance, business model and strategy. Website publication The Directors are responsible for ensuring the Annual Report and the Financial Statements are made available on a website. Financial Statements are published on the Company’s website in accordance with legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of Financial Statements, which may vary from legislation in other jurisdictions. The maintenance and integrity of the Company’s website is the responsibility of the Directors. The Directors’ responsibility also extends to the ongoing integrity of the Financial Statements contained therein. Report of Directors and Responsibility Statement The Report of the Directors on pages 36 to 69 of the Annual Report (other than pages 61 to 63 which form part of the Strategic Report) of the Annual Report and Accounts has been approved by the Board. The Directors have chosen to include information relating to future development of the Company and relationships with suppliers, customers and others, and their impact on the Board’s decisions on pages 30 to 35 of the Annual Report. Each of the Directors, who are listed on pages 37 to 40 of the Annual Report, confirm to the best of their knowledge that: On behalf of the Board All revenue and capital items in the above statement derive from continuing operations. The ‘Total’ column of this statement is the profit and loss account of the Company and the ‘Revenue’ and ‘Capital’ columns represent supplementary information prepared under guidance issued by the Association of Investment Companies. The Company does not have any other comprehensive income and hence profit for the year, as disclosed above, is the same as the Company’s total comprehensive income. The £553.6m (2023: £574.6m) of unrealised capital reserve arising on the revaluation of investments is subject to fair value movements and may not be readily realisable at short notice, as such it may not be entirely distributable. The unrealised capital reserve includes unrealised gains on borrowings of £22.8m (2023: £5.5m) and gains on unquoted investments of £3.5m (2023: £nil) which are not distributable. The Financial Statements were approved by the Board of Directors and authorised for issue on 6 March 2025. They were signed on its behalf by: Jo DixonChair of the Audit and Risk Committee The financial information set out above does not constitute the Company's statutory Financial Statements for the years ended 31 December 2024 or 2023, but is derived from those Financial Statements. Statutory accounts for 2023 have been delivered to the Registrar of Companies and those for 2024 will be delivered following the Company's Annual General Meeting. The auditors have reported on those accounts; their reports were unqualified, did not draw attention to any matters by way of emphasis without qualifying their report and did not contain statements under s498(2) or (3) Companies Act 2006. The same accounting policies, presentations and methods of computation are followed in these Financial Statements as were applied in the Company’s last annual audited Financial Statements, other than those stated in the Annual Report. Basis of accounting The Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards (‘IASs’). The Financial Statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except that investments and fixed rate notes are stated at fair value through the profit and loss. The Association of Investment Companies (‘AIC’) issued a Statement of Recommended Practice: Financial Statements of Investment Companies (‘AIC SORP’) in July 2022. The Directors have sought to prepare the Financial Statements in accordance with the AIC SORP where the recommendations are consistent with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’). The Company qualifies as an investment entity. The Company has no securities in issue that could dilute the return per ordinary share. Therefore the basic and diluted earnings per ordinary share are the same. There are amounts of £1,222 (2023: £1,222) and £34,225 (2023: £34,225) owed to AT2006 and The Second Alliance Trust Limited, respectively, at year-end. There are no other related parties other than those noted below. Transactions with key management personnel Details of the Non-Executive Directors are disclosed on pages 37 to 40 of the Annual Report. For the purpose of IAS 24 ‘Related Party Disclosures’, key management personnel comprised the Non-Executive Directors of the Company. Details of remuneration are disclosed in the Remuneration Report on pages 55 to 60 of the Annual Report. ANNUAL REPORT The Annual Report will be available in due course on the Company's website www.alliancewitan.com.

Title: BlackRock’s Vivek Paul explains why India remains strong bet for global investors

BlackRock Investment Institute sees India as a key investment destination despite short-term market fluctuations. Vivek Paul of BlackRock, believes that India presents strong structural growth opportunities that make it a long-term winner."If we were thinking for anybody with an investing horizon 5, 10 years out, we would be building portfolios today using our core IP, where you would hold a greater allocation than a benchmark weight," Paul said in an ET Now interaction.BlackRock maintains an overweight position on both Indian equities and bonds, as the country's demographics and economic positioning remain favorable. Paul remains bullish on India’s economic potential and advises investors to allocate more than the benchmark weight to Indian markets."Structural opportunities are sizable in India. The demographic forces underpinning India are really strong, and the country’s multi-aligned geopolitical stance is likely to benefit it more in the future," said Paul. India is uniquely positioned to capitalize on global economic shifts, particularly in labor markets and geopolitics."Most of the developed markets and China, are going to experience a shortfall in the working age population over the coming 20 years. India is going to experience a big gain in the working age population in the coming years. And you think about the geopolitical dynamics that we are in now, a multi-aligned country such as India is likely to benefit from that sort of environmentt," Paul explained. While short-term economic cycles may create market fluctuations, India’s long-term fundamentals remain strong."We cannot assume that we will never see cyclical dynamics. Liquidity has been constrained, consumption is more challenged, and global uncertainty remains. But once these unwind, attention will shift back to fundamentals," Paul noted.Investors should differentiate between short-term volatility and long-term growth trends to make informed investment decisions. The debate on Indian market valuations continues, but Paul believes that India remains reasonably priced relative to its growth potential."If you think about risk premia associated with Indian stocks, I would argue that it is not particularly expensive in a historical context. Taking into account future earnings growth and different rate cycles, Indian equities remain attractive," Paul stated.While traditional valuation metrics may suggest high stock prices, expected earnings growth and interest rate trends justify India’s market positioning. Paul maintains his positive long-term outlook on India, advising investors to stay invested in large-cap equities and selective bond allocations."International investors will want to tap into India’s opportunities as the focus shifts back to fundamentals," he emphasized.Investors should focus on high-quality Indian stocks with strong earnings potential while maintaining exposure to the bond market for stable returns. Despite short-term market fluctuations, Vivek Paul sees India as a major growth driver for global portfolios."On a structural horizon, there is an opportunity in India. We see strong demographic forces, favorable geopolitical positioning, and long-term economic momentum supporting future growth," Paul said.Paul advises investors to stay invested for the long term, focus on structural growth over cyclical fluctuations, and view India as a key component of a globally diversified portfolio.(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

The former British colony is caught in the eye of a storm between Beijing and Washington, underlined by the decision by conglomerate CK Hutchison, controlled by Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing, to sell its ports network, including assets along the Panama Canal, to a U.S. consortium led by BlackRock. U.S. President Donald Trump, who claimed in January that the Panama Canal was being operated by a Chinese company, has hailed the deal.

Title: BlackRock Buys Key Panama Ports Amid U.S.-China Tensions

The deal was worth $22.8 billion and also involved a few dozen ports around the world. According to a Bloomberg report, it was the head of the banking giant who pitched the idea to the president. Citing unnamed sources familiar with the developments, Larry Fink offered Trump to buy the ports, whose Chinese-linked ownership had concerned the U.S. president. That concern happened to coincide with BlackRock’s ambition to expand globally in search of fresh profit opportunities and the perception that port ownership could present such an opportunity. The finance major paid $19 billion for the ports of Balboa and Cristobal to CK Hutchinson, which is owned by one of Asia’s wealthiest individuals, Hong Kong billionaire investor Li Ka-Shing. Along with the Panama ports, CK Hutchinson will also sell its controlling stakes in 43 other ports in 23 countries, the Wall Street Journal said, quoting an unnamed source close to the seller as saying, “It was a very elegant solution. Li does not like leaving things lingering.” Trump has had his sights on the Panama Canal ever since he won the November vote. “Has anyone ever heard of the Panama Canal?” Trump said in December. “Because we're being ripped off at the Panama Canal like we're being ripped off everywhere else.” “It was given to Panama and the people of Panama, but it has provisions,” the then president-elect went on to say of the Panama Canal. “If the principles, both moral and legal, of this magnanimous gesture of giving are not followed, then we will demand that the Panama Canal be returned to us, in full, quickly and without question.” Later, the president’s rhetoric toughened further, with him saying he would not exclude the use of force to reclaim U.S. control over the critical waterway that handles U.S. exports of liquefied natural gas to one of its key markets: Asia. The Panama Canal was built by the United States in the early 20th century. Panama granted the U.S. the right to build and operate the canal in exchange for annual payments. Ownership over the infrastructure was passed to the Panamanian government in 1977 by President Jimmy Carter. The deal granted control over the Panama Canal to the local government under the obligation of maintaining its neutrality. However, port ownership by a company with links to the Chinese government sparked concern about this neutrality in the new federal government, which is where BlackRock stepped in with a potential solution, according to media reports. Per Bloomberg, KKR and Blackstone were also bidders for the ports. The Panama Canal is the shortest route for U.S. LNG sold in Asia. However, it is not always the cheapest route or the fastest. The Canal authorities charge a fee for passage through the chokepoint, and weather conditions sometimes make it impossible to use it. That happened recently when a two-year drought made navigation through the Canal challenging and led to extended delays in goods delivery. Even so, the Panama Canal remains a key piece of infrastructure for U.S. energy exports, and there have even been discussions in recent years of boosting its capacity to handle an even greater volume of LNG exports. It is not without alternatives, however, which LNG exporters use whenever the economics of using the Panama Canal do not make sense. As Cheniere Energy’s chief operating officer put it last year, during the worst of the drought, “We use the canal when it is economical to do so, right now it is not. Right now the market in the Far East is not supporting it, and the waiting time, with us not being a priority customer, is just not worth us using it right now.” By Charles Kennedy for Oilprice.com More Top Reads From Oilprice.com Back to homepage Previous Post Abu Dhabi’s ADNOC Buys Its First Dubai Crude via Platts Pricing Process Next Post Big Oil Stocks Hammered After OPEC’s Move To Boost Output Charles is a writer for Oilprice.com China Looks To Derail The West’s Strategy To Replace Russian Gas Supplies Refinery Shutdowns, Growing Demand Could Send Fuel Inventories to 25-year Low These Canadian Energy Firms Could Be Among The Hardest Hit By U.S. Tariffs Russian Oil Supply To Czech Republic Cut Amid U.S. Sanctions Ontario Premier Threatens to Cut Off Electricity to 1.5 Million Americans ADVERTISEMENT © OilPrice.com The materials provided on this Web site are for informational and educational purposes only and are not intended to provide tax, legal, or investment advice.

NEXT | The Queue: I am a Negative Man The next phase of content for WoW Classic anniversary realms, Phase 3, will go live in game at 3PM pacific time on Thursday March 20, 2025. Phase 3 is actually being split in to two separate releases, with the second half scheduled to drop on Thursday April 3, 2025, also at 3PM pacific time. Based on the previous releases for anniversary realms, this means we can expect some downtime on Tuesday March 18 ahead of the phase rollout. Let’s take a look at what you can expect to go live with the Phase 3 update! March 20, 2025: April 3, 2025: Blackwing Lair is the headline PVE activity in Phase 3 but before players can take on this level 60 raid and the 8 bosses within, they’ll need to complete a short attunement questline that takes them through the Upper Blackrock Spire dungeon. Blackwing Lair rewards the highly sought after Tier 2 set pieces but if in order to complete their sets, players will also need to run Onyxia’s Lair for head pieces and Molten Core for leg pieces. The Darkmoon Faire will also appear in Elwynn Forest and Mulgore on March 20, with associated breadcrumb quests in Stormwind and Orgrimmar. Vendors for the Argent Dawn, Thorium Brotherhood, Timbermaw Hold, Silverwing Sentinels, and the Warsong Outriders will open up their inventories as a reward for progressing through their reputation tracks, allowing you to purchase certain gear, crafting recipes, and consumables. Alliance players will only be able to progress with Silvering Sentinels and the Warsong Outriders will only reward Horde players. Each class has an associated level 50 questline that rewards them with a unique rare-quality reward upon completion. These quests start in different zones based on your class but they all end at the Sunken Temple dungeon. Later, on April 3, the PVP Honor Rank will raise to 14 and the Arathi Basin battleground will open up for players above level 20. Players will also get a recurring battleground holiday event every weekend, running from Thursday at midnight (Friday) and lasting through Tuesday, presumably ending at reset. Each weekend will feature a different map and completing objectives in battlegrounds during this event will yield increased levels of Honor and Faction rewards. The first event is scheduled for April 4 in Arathi Basin. We’ll keep you updated on everything else coming to Classic anniversary realms once we learn about them!

Title: Dealmakers Head to New Orleans to Look Beyond ‘Havoc’ in M&A

Full Content:
(Bloomberg) -- Dealmakers gathered at an annual conference in New Orleans this week to catch their breath and try to look for reasons to be optimistic about a mergers and acquisitions market that has disappointed so far in 2025. “People want to do deals,” Audra Cohen, co-managing partner at law firm Sullivan & Cromwell’s general practice group, said during a presentation Thursday at Tulane University’s Corporate Law Institute event. She was speaking against a backdrop of falling deal values, with activity in part impacted by US President’s Donald Trump’s policies on the economy and foreign affairs. “Things like the tariffs give people a little bit of pause because they’re having to look at their business, at the supply chain and trying to figure out what that means,” Cohen said. “Until a little bit of this settles, it’s going to be challenging to get deals done particularly at valuations that people would expect.” Every year around this time, Wall Street’s clubby network of M&A lawyers, bankers and public relations professionals heads to Louisiana to talk shop at Tulane. Many dealmakers began 2025 expecting a banner year under Trump. But they’ve instead crashed into the harsh reality of trade wars and geopolitical clashes. “There’s a lack of predictability right now,” said Scott Barshay, chair of the corporate department at Paul Weiss Rifkind Wharton & Garrison. “Our clients are kind of waiting and seeing right now to see how things sort out. There’s a lot of interest in doing things.” Barshay said that the head of a company that was seeking to pursue a big transaction recently told him that the company plans to “wait a little while,” as it didn’t want to strike a deal only to see the market crater the next day. Barshay said he still expected the year to end on a positive note. “There’s just a little bit of a pause but I don’t think it’s a lot of pause,” he said. “I think we’re going to see over the next few weeks announcements of some bigger deals coming out.” ‘Wreaks Havoc’ Global deal values are down about 16% in 2025 to roughly $485 billion, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Jennifer Muller, co-head of Houlihan Lokey Inc.’s special committee advisory and fairness and solvency opinions practices, said it will be hard for values to hit the $3.5 trillion that many had expected this year. This week’s movement in the VIX Index, a closely watched measure of stock market volatility, is a worry, she said. “In order for M&A and IPOs to flourish, typically market volatility needs to stay below or around 20 on a consistent basis,” Muller said. “Most have predicted that Trump’s actions would create some enhanced volatility and indeed the VIX has been dancing around 20 and yesterday ended around 20. This wreaks havoc with M&A transactions.” Muller said she saw potential for a pickup in activity in deals around artificial intelligence, pharmaceuticals, financial services and oil and gas. Another wrinkle in the M&A market under Trump 2.0 is that the US government could want more of a say in negotiations around deals that it sees as having the potential to impact America’s competitiveness. This week, BlackRock Inc. led one of the biggest acquisitions of the year in a deal that marked both the firm’s expanded reach in infrastructure and a win for Trump, who had raised concerns over control of key ports near the Panama Canal. “Political leaders are getting into the deal process and [asking] for political concessions around the deal,” said Leo Strine Jr., of counsel in the corporate department at Wachtell Lipton Rosen & Katz. “That’s a new dynamic. If the US is going to involve itself in who does a deal, if the US government has a perspective on a cross-border deal, is the other government going to be involved?” More stories like this are available on bloomberg.com ©2025 Bloomberg L.P.

Title: Bitwise enters DeFi through institutional allocation with Maple Finance

Bitwise's investment through Maple Finance highlights the accelerating trend of institutions seeking attractive yields in DeFi markets. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Bitwise has taken a significant step into DeFi with its first institutional allocation through Maple Finance. This initiative will allow Bitwise to access on-chain credit while maintaining compliance with institutional regulatory standards on Maple’s platform. The firm, which manages over $12 billion in client assets, announced the move in a statement shared with CryptoSlate on March 6. Following the news, Maple Finance’s native SYRUP token increased by almost 10% to $0.145 as of press time. According to the statement, the development highlights the increasing demand for yield-generating opportunities in digital assets, particularly among institutional investors. The firm noted that its move signals a broader trend of institutions expanding beyond traditional fixed-income markets and exploring on-chain lending as a more efficient and scalable alternative. Jeff Park, Head of Alpha Strategies at Bitwise, emphasized the growing role of tokenization in institutional adoption. He noted that while many misuse terms like “tokenized securities” and “securitized tokens,” the latter is poised to drive real institutional adoption due to its practical benefits in the crypto ecosystem. Park added: “Private credit on crypto rails remains one of the most immediate opportunities for institutions who are looking to achieve high risk-adjusted yield with the additional benefits of liquidity, transparency, and efficiency that only DeFi can provide. With regulatory clarity that is being unleashed in D.C., it is now only a matter of time.” Meanwhile, the partnership between Bitwise and Maple Finance could pave the way for wider adoption of regulated on-chain lending platforms. Institutional investors are increasingly looking to credit markets as a source of alpha, and Maple’s growing track record positions it as a key player in this space. Nikolai Milutin, an ambassador for Maple, said the move shows that institutional adoption of on-chain credit is now underway. He added: “Bitwise has taken the first step by leveraging DeFi through Maple. This move signals a turning point—other institutions will follow, and it won’t be long before giants like Coinbase, Binance, and BLACKROCK take notice.” Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

Title: Shipping Giant MSC Set to Become World’s Largest Terminal Operator in $22.8B Hutchison Ports Deal

Essential news coupled with the finest maritime content sourced from across the globe. MSC ships at the Port of Long Beach. Photo courtesy Port of Long Beach In a landmark deal announced on Tuesday, Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison will sell its 80% stake in Hutchison Ports Holding to a Blackrock-TiL consortium, positioning Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC)—already the world’s largest ocean carrier by far—to become the global leader in container terminal operations, according to Drewry’s analysis of the deal. The $22.8 billion transaction, the largest ever in the global container terminal sector, comes amid heightened political scrutiny over Chinese influence in critical maritime infrastructure. Notably, the deal also includes the sale of Hutchison Port Holdings’ 90% interest in Panama Ports Company, which operates the Balboa and Cristobal ports on opposite ends of the Panama Canal. Since December, President Trump has repeatedly criticized alleged Chinese influence over Panama Canal operations and discriminatory practices against the U.S.—claims that the Panamanian government has firmly rejected. “My administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal, and we’ve already started doing it,” Trump said in his address to a joint session of Congress this week. “Just today, a large American company (BlackRock) announced they are buying both ports around the Panama Canal and lots of other things having to do with the Panama Canal and a couple of other canals.” Drewry’s global terminal operator (GTO) rankings show Hutchison Ports currently operates 43 maritime container terminals outside China and Hong Kong, spanning from Australia to the UAE, with a combined capacity exceeding 73 million TEU and throughput of nearly 47 million TEU as of 2023. MSC’s existing portfolio, which includes a 70% stake in Terminal Investment Limited (TiL), full ownership of Africa Global Logistics, and various Italian terminals through Marinvest, handled over 70 million TEU in 2023, according to Drewry. “The proposed deal will see MSC leapfrog other leading GTOs to secure the top spot in the global terminal operator rankings which Drewry produces each year, securing the Swiss-headquartered container carrier a truly global network of container terminals,” points out Eleanor Hadland, Drewry’s Lead Analyst for Ports and Terminals. However, regulatory hurdles may complicate the acquisition. Drewry’s analysis reveals key areas of concern include Panama, where TiL already holds significant interests opposite Hutchison’s operations; Rotterdam, where the deal could affect competition across Northwest Europe; and Spain, where both companies maintain substantial terminal presence. Drewry notes that the partnership leverages a longstanding relationship between MSC and Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), now owned by Blackrock. GIP’s initial 35% stake in TiL, acquired in 2013 and currently at 20%, has proven crucial for TiL’s expansion. “This deal appears to be a major win for MSC, which secures additional capacity in several key markets,” concludes Hadland. “We do however expect the regulatory processes to extend for at least a year, and foresee competition authorities taking a particular interest in the Northwest Europe, Spain and Panama markets.” Join the gCaptain Club for curated content, insider opinions, and vibrant community discussions.

Title: Blackrock reach Leinster Schools Senior Cup final after proving too strong for Roscrea

The traditionalists wouldn’t have it any other way. Brian Walsh and James Browne scored a brace of tries each as Blackrock qualified to meet Terenure in the Leinster Schools Senior Cup final at Tallaght Stadium on St Patrick’s Day. Roscrea almost got the perfect start. Rob Carney made a strong carry, taking a number of would-be tacklers with him, but Sam Cusack couldn’t quite take the offload. Blackrock hit back straight away. Harry O’Neil and Michael O’Sullivan made dents but Aiden Vetjens was rattled by Keelan Dunne for a knock-on. No matter, ‘Rock props Ben Guerin and Sam Bishti straightened an attack. The ball found Johnny O’Sullivan knifing through for Paddy Clancy to convert in the 11th minute. From a scrum, the ‘Rock boys then moved wide for Johnny O’Sullivan to eat up metres. Brian Walsh took Geoff Wall’s flat ball for a try, converted by Clancy for 14-0 in the 15th minute. Still, Roscrea’s maul was starting to gather momentum and Eoin Naughton claimed a confidence-boosting try. Jack Deegan converted. When Johnny O’Sullivan made his next incursion, Albert Lindner looked a racing certainty to make the line until Sam Cusack caused a spill in the act of grounding. [ Michael Smyth grabs hat-trick as Terenure see off St Fintan’s to book final slotOpens in new window ] Nevertheless, the Williamstown school was slipping through the gears. Something had to give and it would be Roscrea’s fringe defence off a maul. Number eight Walsh peeled off for his second try, converted by Clancy for 21-7 at half-time. Roscrea, however, were not quite ready to accept their fate and Deegan kicked a penalty to narrow the deficit early in the second half. But ‘Rock stormed back and, following a Vetjens interception, Johnny O’Sullivan sent Browne over in the corner for 26-10 in the 39th minute. Roscrea still had an ace to play. A smooth lineout was moved to Deegan, whose venomous in-to-out movement ended beside the posts where he converted for 26-17 in the 50th minute. Another interception, by Bernard Whyte this time, put Blackrock back where they wanted to be deep in Roscrea territory. Fionn Carney prevented a try by Vetjens, but Bishti couldn’t be stopped. Clancy converted for 33-17 in the 65th minute. That was the ball game. There was still time for Michael O’Sullivan’s break and sound handling to see Browne into the right corner to clinch a day with destiny.
