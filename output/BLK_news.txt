Financial institutions across the world are engaging in the height of hypocrisy, publicly renouncing controversial groups while continuing to uphold its principles and objectives. BlackRock is the latest, and largest, to join a growing list of financial institutions like JPMorgan, Citigroup, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley that are withdrawing from the United Nations’ Net-Zero alliances. But while these institutions may appear to distance themselves from a controversial agenda, they remain steadfast in their commitment to the climate agenda — prioritizing political activism over fiduciary responsibility and economic growth. (RELATED: O.H. SKINNER: Will Joe Biden Slip Through One Last Dark Money Giveaway In His Closing Days?) A recent study shows coordinated efforts to defund politically disfavored industries, such as fossil fuels, may not only harm consumers, but also violate antitrust laws, according to the Texas Public Policy Foundation and Boyden Gray & Associates. Banks that publicly pledged to curtail funding for Arctic oil drilling or coal mining may have done so to pressure competitors to follow suit. Such actions, if left unchecked, could jeopardize the energy security of the United States while artificially inflating energy costs for businesses and families alike. The decision for BlackRock to leave the Net-Zero Asset Managers Initiative (NZAMI) and the banks to leave the Net-Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA) might suggest these financial institutions are responding to growing scrutiny and political pressure over Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) initiatives. Legal challenges, such as the lawsuit filed by Texas and 10 other states against major asset managers, allege that ESG policies violate antitrust laws by colluding to constrain fossil fuel production and inflate energy prices. Public backlash against these policies has only intensified, particularly in regions where energy is becoming expensive and scarce. But actions speak louder than words — or, in this case, affiliations. Despite exiting the NZAMI and NZBA, these financial giants continue to pledge allegiance to net-zero goals, demanding divestment from essential energy sectors like coal and oil in an attempt to starve politically disfavored industries of capital. The result? Reduced energy security, higher costs for consumers, and a financial system that prioritizes activism over fiduciary duty and financial stability. Meanwhile, these policies give a competitive advantage to nations like China, which continues to expand coal production for cheap electricity and dominate critical mineral supply chains, further weakening the United States’ energy independence and global economic position. This contradiction exposes a deeper truth: the ESG movement is not about balance or responsibility. It is about control. By mandating adherence to subjective social and environmental metrics, ESG policies bypass the free market and erode the competitive principles that drive innovation and prosperity. The hypocrisy of these institutions is stark. On one hand, they tout their departure from these controversial UN alliances, likely hoping to avoid further legal and political backlash. On the other hand, they continue to uphold the same principles that have driven lawsuits and public criticism in the first place. This serves no one — not the ordinary Americans struggling to make ends meet, not the investors seeking strong returns, and certainly not the global economy, which depends on energy abundance and stability. If these institutions are serious about restoring trust and accountability, they must go beyond symbolic gestures. It is not enough to leave the NZAMI and NZBA while still practicing what they preach. Real change requires embracing policies that support energy innovation and accessibility for all. It means prioritizing economic growth and energy security over appeasing activist groups. Policymakers, too, have a role to play. They must hold financial institutions accountable — for the spirit of competition and fairness that underpins our markets. States like Texas have already taken meaningful steps to protect consumers’ rights, prohibiting taxpayer-funded contracts with companies that collude against the energy sector. Others should follow suit to ensure that banks and asset managers serve their customers, not narrow ideological agendas. The recent exodus from the UN’s Net-Zero alliances is not a victory; it is a half-measure. Until financial institutions fully abandon their net-zero commitments and embrace their responsibility to shareholders, clients and the broader economy, they remain complicit in an agenda that undermines energy security and economic freedom. Actions, not affiliations, define character. It is time for these money managers to prove they’re serious about serving the interests of the many — not the demands of the few alarmists — and abandon these radical political agendas.

Title: Jim Cramer Says ‘Maybe NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) Actually Goes To A New All-time High’

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published an article titled Jim Cramer Discussed These 7 Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. Jim Cramer, host of Mad Money, recently shared his thoughts on the market’s movements this week, focusing on the economic data that’s shaping the outlook. He highlighted the upcoming nonfarm payroll report on Friday, noting its potential to sway market sentiment. Cramer pointed out that the market has been shaken by the persistently high 10-year treasury bond yields, which refuse to drop. “Friday’s employment numbers need to show lower wage growth and disappointing hiring. Now that could bring down the yield in the 10-year and therefore make people feel that the Fed will be back on schedule to start cutting the rates again. We gotta get them back into that groove, you know. On the other hand, if hiring and wages remain hot, well then anything good that happens next week could be repealed.” READ ALSO Jim Cramer Discussed These 10 NASDAQ 100 Stocks Recently and Jim Cramer's Bold Predictions About These 10 Healthcare Stocks The labor report is especially critical, according to Cramer, because despite the strength in sectors like autos, housing, and materials, the overall economy may still be running too hot for the Fed to slow it down as needed. He turned his attention to other economic indicators, such as the Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), which is offering strong signals of economic activity. Cramer mentioned a recent report, including Monday’s release of the PMI composite index, as an important barometer for the economy. This data, he explained, provides valuable insights into how the economy is performing across different sectors, with particular attention to manufacturing, which has shown particularly strong performance. In addition to these key reports, Cramer also mentioned the implications of the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS), specifically focusing on job openings. “I've been mulling over these job openings numbers and I keep thinking about how President-elect Trump might reverse the high levels of immigration we've seen under the Biden administration.” Cramer warned that mass deportations could create a labor shortage that would drive wages even higher, especially if the country cannot rely on enough workers to fill the gaps. In that case, Cramer mused, "robots may be our only hope," alluding to the role of automation in addressing potential labor shortages. “So here's the bottom line: It’s a light week, but still impactful, accept that people will be on edge ahead of Friday’s employment report. Still, I think you should do some buying if the market gets hammered. As we saw today, it’s not nearly as bad out there as so many think.” Our Methodology For this article, we compiled a list of 7 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on January 3. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the third quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 193 During the episode, Cramer mentioned NVIDIA Corporation’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) Jensen’s speech on Monday and said: “Tech was strong all day today, you know, it's the leader again in part thanks to the buzz around Nvidia, CEO Jensen Huang’s speech at CES on Monday night, Vegas. Right now, as I've stressed… I think we could be dazzled by the use cases for Nvidia's latest chips, especially the video component. Any company that buys the platform of GPUs and software can make a fortune from it. That's important because we keep hearing that Amazon wants to compete head-to-head with Nvidia. Something, by the way, I don't even believe. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a well-known name in the graphics, computing, and networking industries and its graphics processing units and the CUDA software platform have become crucial for AI infrastructure. At the CES 2025 event, the company revealed several new products. CEO Jensen Huang presented innovations targeting AI applications, including those designed to advance robot and vehicle training, along with new gaming chips and a debut desktop computer. One of the highlights of the event was the introduction of Cosmos foundation models, a new AI model. These models, which generate photo-realistic video, offer a more cost-effective method of training robots and self-driving vehicles compared to traditional data usage. Additionally, Huang unveiled the new RTX 50 series gaming chips, which incorporate NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) Blackwell AI technology, a key driver behind the company's growth in data centers. Huang also provided a financial outlook for NVIDIA's automotive hardware and software division, forecasting revenue of $5 billion for fiscal 2026, up from an expected $4 billion in fiscal 2025. Overall NVDA ranks 1st on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: BlackRock, Ally, Microsoft, Washington Post and other US firms to lay off staff in 2025; check full list

Workforce reductions in the past two years have been a major concern across sectors, including tech, media, finance, manufacturing, and retail. However, according to a Business Insider report published on January 9, layoffs in major global firms, including Microsoft, BlackRock, and Ally, will continue in 2025. Among the multiple reasons the firms cite, they want to slim their staff as part of the cost-cutting measures against the backdrop of technological change, especially over the next five years because of the rise of artificial intelligence (AI). A couple of days ago, the World Economic Forum released its 'Future of Jobs Report', in which it mentioned that as many as 41 per cent of companies want to reduce their workforce due to AI automation. The report added that 170 million new jobs would be created by 2030, and 92 million jobs would be displaced. Earlier, firms like Dropbox, Google, and IBM announced job cuts related to AI. BlackRock: According to Bloomberg, BlackRock told employees that it was planning to cut about 200 people from its 21,000-strong workforce. These reductions are more than offset by the addition of some 3,750 workers in 2024, and another 2,000 are expected to be added in 2025. The cuts would help realign the firm's resources with its strategy, Bloomberg quoted BlackRock's president, Rob Kapito, and its chief operating officer, Rob Goldstein, as saying. Bridgewater: On Monday, Bridgewater Associates cut 7 per cent of its staff, aiming to stay lean, reported Business Insider, quoting a source. With these layoffs, the world's largest hedge fund staff count comes to where it was in 2023. Earlier in 2019, The company's founder, Ray Dalio, said about 30 per cent of new employees were leaving the firm within 18 months. Washington Post: In an effort to cut costs, The Washington Post is eliminating less than 100 employees, Reuters reported on Tuesday. Stating that the changes wouldn't affect the newsroom, the spokesperson said, as quoted by Reuters, "The Washington Post is continuing its transformation to meet the needs of the industry, build a more sustainable future and reach audiences where they are." Microsoft: Taking a harder look at underperforming employees, Microsoft is planning job cuts. However, the firm declined to share details on the number of employees to be fired. "At Microsoft, we focus on high-performance talent," the BI quoted a spokesperson as saying. "We are always working on helping people learn and grow. When people are not performing, we take the appropriate action," the spokesperson noted. Ally: The digital financial services major Ally is laying off roughly 500 of its 11,000 employees, a spokesperson confirmed to BI. "As we continue to right-size our company, we made the difficult decision to selectively reduce our workforce in some areas while continuing to hire in our other areas of business," BI quoted the spokesperson as saying. The Ally made a similar level of cuts in October 2023, reported the Charlotte Observer. Catch all the Business News , Corporate news , Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint.

Title: U.S. Job Growth Excels But These Companies Are Announcing Layoffs

Jobs growth is encouraging, but layoffs remain. Jobs and job growth in the U.S. beat expectations, as the unemployment rate fell to 4.1% in December. Reuters says that the labor market “ended the year on solid footing” and called the report from the U.S. Bureau of Labor and Statistics “upbeat”. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 256,000 jobs - which is the highest level since March of last year. Economists had predicted payrolls advancing by 160,000. The U.S. economy grew by 2.32 million jobs in 2024. But, as with any market snapshot, not every part of the picture is positive. Management jobs continue to disappear, and white collar workers have seen shrinkage over the past 12 months. The World Economic Forum says that over 40% of companies worldwide are expecting to reduce their workforces over the next five years, as part of the rising impact of artificial intelligence (AI). Several big-name companies are starting 2025 with announcements of layoffs and job cuts. Big tech companies like Google, IBM, Tesla, TikTok, Snap and Dropbox implemented job cuts in 2024, according to TechCrunch. These layoffs are, in part, result of leveraging new capabilities of AI. Here are some other major players with announcements already underway: Inside a robust job report, pockets of layoffs remain - especially in finance and technology-related fields. While AI is part of the reason for the job cuts, opportunities in AI remain (for workers with the right skills). Notice that job gains were concentrated in non-cyclical industries, such as healthcare, which added 46,000 jobs. The retail and leisure/hospitality sectors added 43,000 jobs, respectively, last month. While overall job growth remains strong, the strength of opportunity depends on industry. For knowledge workers in tech and finance, the job growth picture is changing for 2025. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

Los Angeles Liz Wolfe | 1.10.2025 9:30 AM L.A. fires nowhere near contained: So far, at least 10 people have been killed by the wildfires in and around Los Angeles. More than 35,000 acres have been consumed, and more than 10,000 structures destroyed. Wind speeds had lessened last night, only to pick up again this morning, with gusts reaching 81 miles per hour in L.A.'s northern mountains. A new fire broke out last night, named the Kenneth fire, in the West Hills. The Palisades fire and Eaton fire are at 6 percent containment and 0 percent containment, respectively, both now ranking among the top five most destructive fires in California's history. ("Containment basically measures the fire's potential for growth, not how much of it has been extinguished," notes The New York Times.) The California National Guard has been called in by Gov. Gavin Newsom, and President Joe Biden has pledged that the federal government will cover the area's emergency response costs for the next six months. (There are only a few days left in Biden's term, so it remains to be seen whether President-elect Donald Trump will maintain this commitment.) The Pentagon has sent in Navy helicopters to help with the firefighting. You are reading Reason Roundup, our daily, morning newsletter. Want articles just like this in your inbox every morning?

Δ So far, at least one man has been arrested for trying to start fires in Woodland Hills, near Calabasas, riding around on a bike using a blowtorch trying to set Christmas trees and garbage cans on fire. He seemed like he was "on something," according to one resident who allegedly helped to detain the suspect. Los Angeles police have not confirmed that the Kenneth fire is attributable to arsonists, but the man has been taken into custody. ("If these fires are arson, how society handles this crime and punishment will have ramifications for decades to come," writes venture capitalist Katherine Boyle on X. "What's scary about 'new' forms of violence is that the societal narrative shapes whether they repeat or not. It's called a 'cycle of violence' for a reason; copycats valorize the original crime. Crimes come in waves and eras. School shootings are relatively new, whereas the age of the serial killer seems to have faded. We do not want an arson age.") Reports of widespread looting are also worrying residents; those whose homes survived fear that their possessions will be gone when they return. Los Angeles police have been making arrests, attempting to maintain a semblance of order amid a disaster situation. "Shame on those who are preying on our residents during this time of crisis," said L.A. County Supervisor Kathryn Barger at a press conference yesterday. Curfews are being implemented in the areas most affected by the fires. The real red pill will come when people try to get permits to rebuild their homes and face multiyear waits. This might finally spell doom for the Coastal Commission, which should not even exist as an organization. https://t.co/LNIooLoTIX — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 10, 2025 Is BlackRock destroying America's housing markets? (No.) "Shadowy private equity giants are buying up the housing supply in communities across New York, leaving everyday homebuyers with fewer and fewer affordable options," said New York Gov. Kathy Hochul (D) yesterday as she introduced a new law aimed at making it harder for hedge funds to buy up single-family homes in the state. Hochul's proposing legislation doesn't ban the practice outright, but rather forces a 75-day waiting period before such firms could place bids on homes hitting the market. The reason why Hochul is tackling this? Well, because progressives (and other random commentators) frequently—and erroneously—like to claim that BlackRock has gobbled up so much American housing stock that normal people can no longer buy houses. Take even the Associated Press's write-up: "Private equity firms own more than 500,000 homes nationwide, according to the governor's news release, with some estimates expecting the firms to own up to 40% of the single-family rental market by 2030. There were more than 145 million housing units in the country in 2023, according to U.S. Census data." I'm sorry, what? How would you go from currently owning 0.3 percent to owning 40 percent over the course of five years? Are BlackRock and others planning to buy 57.5 million housing units? "Experts" might say that this is the plan, but that's because this area in particular is rife with people not knowing what they're talking about. Later, that same article claims that "non-individual investors" own a quarter of single-family homes, per 2021 data. But this includes landlords who have formed limited liability companies (LLCs), which is…a quite common practice. It's true that, in some places, whole neighborhoods are sometimes sold to investors, such as a 124-home subdivision in Conroe, Texas, for which "the winning $32 million bid came from an online property-investing platform, Fundrise LLC, which manages more than $1 billion on behalf of about 150,000 individuals," per The Wall Street Journal. ("We certainly wouldn't expect every single-family community we sell to sell at a 50% gross margin," said the builder's finance chief, Bill Wheat, after the sale.) Places hit harder by this phenomenon include not New York but rather Houston, Miami, Phoenix, and Las Vegas—places with a low-ish cost of living and a fair amount of starter home housing stock. In some cases, investors buying up housing stock and then renting these homes out could even be a good thing: If you are a young family who does not have enough saved up to buy a home in a starter-home subdivision, this allows you to rent. (Long-term, of course, buying a home is a major means by which people start building wealth, so there are trade-offs here.) Still, this isn't even a widespread practice in New York, so it's unclear why Hochul believes this warrants state intervention. See this for what it really is: An attempt by Hochul to look like she's addressing the issues contributing to housing affordability, when in reality she's doing nothing of the sort. Making it marginally harder for BlackRock to purchase homes is a silly, bad fix. Putting pressure on city governance to end rent control and rent stabilization, slashing regulations that make it hard to build new housing, and loosening or abolishing zoning and land use requirements would all have a greater effect.

Title: December Jobs Report: Labor Market Grew Faster Than Expected As Unemployment Clocks In At 4.1%

Job growth was stronger than economists anticipated last month, according to the Labor Department’s monthly nonfarm payrolls report released Friday morning, a key datapoint as investors and policymakers reassess the state of the economy ahead of the shift in power in the nation’s capital. Friday is the first major economic report of the new year. The U.S. added an estimated 256,000 jobs in December, smashing consensus economist estimates of a seasonally adjusted 153,000, according to FactSet. The unemployment rate was 4.1% last month, compared to forecasts of 4.2%, where it stood in November. Average hourly wages increased by 0.3% to $35.69, marking the 45th straight month of record pay for workers, though the 3.9% annual wages bump is a far cry from the more than 4.5% growth enjoyed by workers across Sept. 2021 through Sept. 2023 as record job switching fueled significant wage increases. The government also said it revised its prior estimates for October job growth upward by 7,000 and for November job growth downward by 15,000. Friday’s nonfarm payrolls is the “first big report of the year” for the U.S. economy, according to Sevens Report founder Tom Essaye, noting the jobs update is “even more important than it would normally be” given the fork in the road for U.S. monetary policy. That’s because the sharp interest rate cuts long yearned for by borrowers and equity investors may be drying up – the Federal Reserve recently indicated it expects far fewer rate cuts in 2025 than previously forecasted – due to a combination of economic factors. Those include a relatively stable labor market, making the need for stimulatory cuts less pressing, and concerns about sticky inflation partially traced back to President-Elect Donald Trump’s proposed tariffs and broader economic gameplan. Conventional economics wisdom says higher interest rates lead to higher unemployment and lower inflation. “The cutting cycle might already be over” if the labor market proves resilient in coming months, cautioned Bank of America strategist Gonzalo Asis in a Monday note to clients. Though 2024 was a solid year for job growth – nonfarm payrolls grew by more than 1% from 157.3 million to more than 159 million from Dec. 2023 to Dec. 2024 – U.S. companies announced the second-most job cuts since 2009 last year, trailing only 2020, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas. High-profile corporations like BlackRock and Microsoft indicated this month they’ll perform small rounds of layoffs. This is the last jobs report before President-elect Donald Trump succeeds Joe Biden. The Biden labor market saw unemployment fall about 2.6 percentage points from Dec. 2020’s 6.7% and total employment grow by 12%, though those numbers are likely skewed positively as the U.S. recovered from the unprecedented effects of COVID-19’s sudden job losses.

Title: BlackRock Leaves Major Climate Group Amid Wall Street Exodus
URL: https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2025/01/10/807764.htm
Time Published: 2025-01-10T13:13:37Z

BlackRock Inc. is parting ways with one of the world’s biggest climate-investor groups after being targeted by Republican politicians for its efforts on global warming. The money manager has decided to leave the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative it said in a letter to clients on Thursday. Membership in the group “caused confusion regarding BlackRock’s practices and subjected us to legal inquiries from various public officials,” the New York-based firm said. BlackRock, which oversees more than $11 trillion, has been the subject of attacks from GOP lawmakers for embracing what conservatives call “woke” policies. Most recently, BlackRock was among a group of asset managers singled out in a lawsuit led by Texas alleging breaches of antitrust laws due to the adoption of pro-climate strategies that suppress coal production. And with President-elect Donald Trump headed for the White House, Wall Street is bracing for more attacks on climate finance. “BlackRock has hung in there as long as it could, but the pressure has become too great, and the reputational and legal risks too high, just before Trump takes office,” Hortense Bioy, head of sustainable investing research at Morningstar Sustainalytics, said in an emailed comment. And it “won’t be the last financial organization to quit a net zero initiative,” she said. BlackRock was mentioned, along with firms including State Street Corp. and Vanguard Group Inc., in a report last month from the House Judiciary Committee that said it found “evidence of collusion and anticompetitive behavior” by the financial industry to “impose radical ESG-goals” on US companies. Wall Street’s Top Banks Just Quit a Once Popular Alliance Record Heat Pushed 2024 Above 1.5C Global Warming Threshold Over the past month, a climate coalition for lenders, the Net-Zero Banking Alliance, has seen a mass exodus of US members. Since early December, NZBA lost Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Wells Fargo & Co., Citigroup Inc., Bank of America Corp., Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase & Co. The moves reflect Wall Street’s desire to shield itself from increasing GOP pressure. And there are signs the strategy is working. Earlier this week, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton dropped his threat to cut off the lenders from municipal-bond deals after they quit NZBA. “Our participation in NZAMi didn’t impact the way we managed client portfolios,” BlackRock said in Thursday’s letter, which was signed by Vice Chairman Philipp Hildebrand and Helen Lees-Jones, global head of sustainable and transition solutions. “Therefore, our departure doesn’t change the way we develop products and solutions for clients or how we manage their portfolios.” BlackRock said it managed more than $1 trillion in sustainable and transition investment strategies as recently as September and “our commitment to helping our clients achieve their investment goals remains unwavering.” NZAMi is a group of roughly 325 asset managers, overseeing about $50 trillion, that are committed to achieving net zero alignment by 2050. State Street Global Advisors, the world’s third-biggest asset manager, said in an emailed statement on Thursday that it remains a member of NZAMi. Vanguard, the second biggest, left the group in 2022. In its statement, BlackRock said its fund managers “continue to assess material climate-related risks, alongside other investment risks, in delivering for clients.” About two-thirds of the firm’s largest clients, including all of its biggest customers in Europe, have made net zero commitments, the money manager said. BlackRock Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink had been a champion of environmental, social and governance strategies, devoting large parts of his annual letters to urging corporate bosses to pay attention to climate change and other societal issues. But then he came under attack from Republicans and some states collectively pulled billions of dollars from BlackRock. In response, Fink has said he no longer uses the ESG label because it’s become too politicized. “BlackRock is under political pressure to exit climate groups and from shareholders who are unhappy with the loss of business from state investment funds that object to the agendas of climate groups,” said Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business.

Title: Retiring Early In The Age Of Longevity: Is It Even Possible?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbesfinancecouncil/2025/01/10/retiring-early-in-the-age-of-longevity-is-it-even-possible/
Time Published: 2025-01-10T12:45:00Z

Tanmay Gupta is a seasoned executive in the insurance industry. The financial independence, retire early (FIRE) movement has gained momentum in recent years. The FIRE movement is based on the simple principle that your savings and passive income should be able to sustain your lifestyle (and inflation). One of the main requirements of this movement is to estimate how long you are likely to live. Since 2000, the average life expectancy across the U.S. has increased from 76.75 years to 79.25 years, and this is despite the pandemic. While living two and a half years longer doesn’t sound like a lot, it does create a massive financial challenge for many individuals, including those planning to retire at a traditional age. Think your pension can solve part of the problem? Think again! As people live longer, public pension systems are getting strained, and consequently, the retirement burden is slowly shifting from the state to the individual. And as you get closer to retirement age, the goalposts will keep shifting (Read: The source of cash flow and living expenses will keep becoming more complex). So, the simple question to ask yourself is whether retiring early is even possible if you are going to live longer than you might expect. This challenge didn’t suddenly arise. The pressure has been building for decades. Medical and technological advancements have accelerated these trends, bringing about a global longevity revolution leading to increased life expectancy. But this positive trend has also exacerbated the retirement challenge. Increased life expectancy has led to a rise in cognitive and degenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's. Unlike the pandemic, this is not an unforeseen or unknown challenge. Several academic, business and government thought leaders have hypothesized potential solutions to this problem. Listed below are a few potential solutions that have gained traction: This strategy includes investing in a combination of stocks and bonds (or ETFs and mutual funds). In its simplest form, this common rule of thumb suggests an annual withdrawal of 4% (inflation-adjusted) of your initial investments, regardless of your portfolio returns. But this strategy has a few drawbacks: • Market risk • No lifetime guarantee • Does not account for personal circumstances, such as illness or spending preference While several fund managers and self-help gurus tout the historical performance of stock markets, one only has to look at the 2007 financial crisis to realize that “past performance is not an indicator of future returns.” A big market correction early on in the investments could take years to make up. Americans are facing the worst housing affordability crisis in decades, so if you can buy housing properties and rent it out until perpetuity, it should provide a steady stream of inflation-adjusted passive income, while the value of real estate also appreciates. Simple? Yes. But anyone who has owned multiple properties will tell you that managing rental homes and finding good renters can be a more challenging feat than your usual nine-to-five job. As these rental properties age, they will also require investments for maintenance, repairs and upgrades. And, above all that, this strategy requires that you find good properties in an inflated market while having enough saved up to buy multiple properties. Fixed indexed annuities, or FIAs, are a type of annuity contract whose interest is linked, in part, to the performance of a market index, such as the S&P 500, but the investor's principal is protected from losses in the index. This characteristic provides growth potential with protection from loss during volatile markets. FIAs, along with fixed-rate annuities, can help policyholders achieve retirement-oriented financial goals through tax-deferred buildup and product riders, which can give guaranteed lifetime income benefits. Fixed annuities provide fixed payouts, potential lifetime payments, tax-deferred build-up and protection for individuals and/or spouses. So, what’s the risk? The biggest risk is that the policyholder premiums may be tied up until the surrender period of the policy. As such, policyholders may not be able to access the build-up value in case of an emergency. While the key retirement industries—wealth management, asset management and insurance—have developed innovative products and services that enhance individuals' ability to address their savings, investment and protection needs, they have done so in an isolated manner. This approach has made it extremely challenging to assemble a comprehensive solution that addresses the multifaceted retirement needs of individuals, resulting in fragmented and suboptimal outcomes. The retirement conundrum presents the biggest challenge for the middle and affluent class (household assets of $100,000 to $3.5 million). The fear of outliving savings has led to a different problem—hoarding. According to BlackRock, 40% of retirees still have over 80% of their savings after nearly two decades of retirement. Both groups may benefit from retirement planning to: 1. Drawdown their existing assets 2. Manage retirement spending 3. Mitigate risks, including longevity risk Meeting retirement needs requires more than just products; it necessitates an integrated and comprehensive suite of solutions designed with specific outcomes and a seamless client experience in mind. Although this may appear straightforward, no industry participant has succeeded in delivering such a solution at scale. Until the retirement industry can figure this out, my recommendation would be to put off any early retirement plans and work toward a comprehensive solution that addresses all possibilities.

Title: BlackRock Continues Wall Street Exodus From Net Zero Alliances

More Info BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, is quitting the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative in the latest exit of a major financial institution from a climate finance alliance since Donald Trump was elected U.S. President in November. BlackRock has decided to leave the voluntary Net Zero Asset Managers initiative, which launched in December 2020 and aims to “support the asset management industry to commit to a goal of net zero emissions in order to mitigate financial risk and to maximize long-term value of assets.” The world’s top asset manager has quit the initiative because its membership has “caused confusion regarding BlackRock’s practices and subjected us to legal inquiries from various public officials,” Vice Chairman Philipp Hildebrand wrote in a letter to institutional clients seen by the Financial Times. BlackRock assured its clients that the exit from the initiative “does not change the way we develop products and solutions for clients or how we manage their portfolios. BlackRock’s active portfolio managers continue to assess material climate-related risks, alongside other investment risks.” BlackRock and major banks have come under increased pressure from Republican politicians and Republican-governed states over their pledges to scale back funding for fossil fuel projects. Texas authorities, for example, have decided to withdraw $8.5 billion in assets of the Permanent School Fund from the asset manager. The Texas legislature passed a law in 2021 to penalize financial firms that, according to state authorities, discriminate against energy companies. At the end of November, a group of Republican states led by Texas sued BlackRock and fellow asset managers Vanguard and State Street, for alleged violation of antitrust laws. The states allege that the asset managers have been pressuring coal firms to lower output to cut emissions, thus driving up electricity prices in America. In pulling out of the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative, BlackRock became the latest major Wall Street financier to exit such groups. Since early December, the biggest U.S. banks – Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo, and JP Morgan – have all quit the Net-Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA), a group of leading global banks committed to aligning their lending, investment, and capital markets activities with net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.

Title: Spot Bitcoin ETFs celebrate 1st birthday with 1.13 million BTC under management

Fidelity and BlackRock lead as spot Bitcoin ETF investors turn $36 billion into $107 billion in 2024. Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States reach their first anniversary tomorrow after over $35 billion in inflows and assets under management of 1.13 million BTC, according to Farside Investors data. BlackRock led the year with $37.85 billion, offset by Grayscale’s net outflow of $21.58 billion. Fidelity’s $12.14 billion is in second place, while Ark and Bitwise also broke $2 billion, with the rest bringing in between $200 and $800 million. Within three months of launch, IBIT’s assets under management stood at $15 billion, while FBTC reached $8 billion. Cumulative net inflows across all Bitcoin ETFs eventually rose to $36.3 billion, with total net assets at $107 billion or 1.13 million BTC. While the inflows represent new money entering the Bitcoin ETFs, the total AUM reflects the combined effect of these inflows, Bitcoin’s price appreciation, and the existing holdings of converted funds. The AUM can be significantly larger than the reported inflows alone. Spot Bitcoin ETF assets (Source: Bitbo) The broad acceptance of these ETFs has spurred speculation around additional crypto-focused offerings. Record-breaking Bitcoin inflows contributed to hopes for a future wave of digital asset funds, with analysts projecting $35 billion in potential Bitcoin ETF inflows in 2025. Meanwhile, Bitcoin itself has maintained a trading range near five figures ahead of the anniversary, moving between $91,000 and $102,000. When the ETFs launched in 2024, Bitcoin’s price was around $46,000, following a momentum-fueled surge from $25,000 in mid-August 2023. Tomorrow, spot Bitcoin ETFs as an asset class cement a historic first year, smashing perceived glass ceilings and challenging conventional ETFs in ways many in traditional finance did not see coming. In a mere 12 months, BlackRock’s IBIT has become the 33rd-largest ETF in the United States. It is also in the top 30 ETFs globally for the past year.

Title: What can blockchain do beyond crypto?
URL: https://qz.com/blockchain-uses-cryptocurrency-bitcoin-technology-1851735689
Time Published: 2025-01-10T10:00:00Z
Full Content:
If you’re familiar with cryptocurrency, you’ve likely come across the term ‘blockchain.’ Blockchain is the foundational technology behind cryptocurrency. Simply put, it’s a digital, decentralized ledger distributed across a network. Imagine it as a secure, publicly accessible database shared among all participants in the network. Blockchain’s potential goes far beyond cryptocurrencies. With countless use cases, this technology is poised to simplify and enhance various aspects of our lives. Let’s explore how blockchain technology operates in various fields beyond cryptocurrencies. 2 / 7 One of the standout features of blockchain technology is its ability to securely record data that cannot be altered. This immutability proves invaluable in supply-chain management. As businesses expand globally, ensuring transparency from the source to the end consumer becomes increasingly crucial. Blockchain enables manufacturers to create and maintain reliable, traceable records of material movements throughout the supply chain. Retail giant Walmart, for example, leverages blockchain technology to address food supply-chain challenges. This allows the company to efficiently track products and streamline its management, ensuring greater accountability and trust. Similarly, shipping giant FedEx (FDX) says it utilizes blockchain technology to enhance its delivery services. 3 / 7 It’s common to misplace important documents such as Social Security cards, birth certificates, vaccination records, and other essential paperwork. Now, imagine moving to a new city where you’re required to present these records for verification. The process of locating and sharing them can quickly become a nightmare, especially if they’ve been lost. Blockchain technology offers a solution to this issue by storing all your documents and identification records on a network. The tech can theoretically ensure such documents are securely stored, easily accessible, and protected from unauthorized alterations. Blockchain has already been used for identification in real-world scenarios. For example, during the Syrian refugee crisis, blockchain technology was used to record the identities of refugees securely. It also facilitated the management of financial aid and grocery purchases, enabling refugees to access necessary resources without any hurdles. 4 / 7 Keeping track of medical records from birth to the present can feel overwhelming, especially when relying on physical files for every doctor’s visit or treatment. Maintaining these records becomes even more challenging with frequent relocations or changes in healthcare providers. Blockchain technology offers a solution to enhance the management of patient records. By leveraging blockchain, medical data can be efficiently tracked and maintained, ensuring seamless access to critical information such as drug supply chains, treatment histories, insurance claims, payments, and more. This technology also bolsters data integrity, providing a tamper-proof system that safeguards sensitive information. 5 / 7 It is difficult to imagine how an intangible technology such as blockchain could transform the real estate sector. But it is arguably now a reality. Blockchain technology is enabling real-world assets, such as real estate and land, to be divided into smaller, transferable units. This process, known as tokenization, is revolutionizing the way these assets are owned and distributed. In simple terms, the tokenization of funds is the process of converting real-world assets (RWAs) or funds into digital tokens using blockchain technology. RWAs encompass tangible assets such as real estate, intellectual properties, art, currencies, commodities, equities, bonds, money markets, and more. These assets frequently encounter challenges related to liquidity, transparency, and accessibility within the traditional financial world. Blockchain technology enables RWAs to be tokenized into digital tokens that allow fractional ownership, potentially making physical assets more accessible to a wider audience. Tokenizing RWAs can increase liquidity, transparency, and accessibility, and is often described as a way to democratize the traditional financial markets. Financial giants such as BlackRock and Visa have jumped into the world of tokenization. If a report by McKinsey & Company is to be believed, the potential value of tokenized assets could reach almost $2 trillion by 2030. 6 / 7 You may have heard of non-fungible tokens, commonly known as NFTs. An NFT is a unique digital asset that can take the form of art, music, in-game items, videos, and other types of digital content stored on a blockchain network and traded using cryptocurrency as a means of exchange. NFTs such as CryptoPunks, created by Larva Labs on the Ethereum blockchain, are among the most expensive. One art piece, CryptoPunk #5822, sold for $23 million in 2022. At first glance, it may seem fun and also ridiculous to consider why someone would spend $23 million on a digital photo that can easily be downloaded for free. The answer is arguably the same as it is for Monalisa’s paintings. Monalisa’s paintings are so valuable because there is only one original, despite the fact that many copies were made by different artists. It doesn’t matter how many copies are made; the value of Monalisa will remain the same. NFTs represent an early and primitive application of blockchain technology, with significant potential for evolution. They demonstrate how artists can leverage blockchain to protect their creations and secure them as intellectual property. In the virtual world, where copyrights and intellectual property rights are often ambiguous, blockchain provides a potentially powerful tool for creators to assert ownership and safeguard their work. 7 / 7

Title: Automattic says it will reduce its contribution to WordPress core project to match WP Engine

Automattic, the company that runs WordPress.com, said that it would reduce its contribution to WordPress core, the open source project that acts as the backbone of most of Automattic’s products and ensures the longevity of WordPress as a technology and community. Automattic CEO and WordPress co-creator Matt Mullenweg has been in a kerfuffle with WP Engine since September last year over the very issue of contribution to WordPress as an open source and community project. In a blog post, the company said that it would reduce the number of hours it commits to the Five For the Future program to match rival hosting provider WP Engine’s contribution in terms of the number of weekly hours. “As part of this reset, Automattic will match its volunteering pledge with those made by WP Engine and other players in the ecosystem, or about 45 hours a week that qualify under the Five For the Future program as benefitting the entire community and not just a single company. These hours will likely go towards security and critical updates,” Automattic said in the latest blog post. The company added that it will redirect the resources to the ongoing legal battle against WP Engine. At an event last year, Mullenweg called WP Engine “cancer to WordPress,” pointing out a large stake owned by private equity firm Silver Lake in the company and a lack of contribution from the hosting provider to support sustainable growth. In the new blog post, Automattic called out this fact again. “WP Engine’s historically slim contributions underscore the imbalance that must be addressed for the health of WordPress. We believe in fairness and shared responsibility, and we hope this move encourages greater participation across all organizations that benefit from WordPress,” Automattic said. Automattic contributes around 2,560 hours per week, as per Five for The Future’s dashboard. This number is already significantly less than the 3,900 hours per week the company contributed in September. It’s not clear if this reduction is because of the company’s shrinking headcount or a general strategy shift. The company’s new blog post also sarcastically noted that members of the “community” have considered working on commercial products like WordPress.com, Pressable, WPVIP, Jetpack, and WooCommerce as contributing to WordPress. So engineers will focus on building those products instead of contributing to WordPress core. Automattic is also under pressure to perform better on a financial point of view. In December, BlackRock marked down its investment in Automattic by 10% — and this wasn’t the first markdown. Overall, the investment firm has devalued its investment by more than 50%. The new directive related to contributions to the community project wasn’t the only decision related to WordPress.org. Earlier this week, Thijs Buijs, a WordPress core contributor and the person who led the sustainability team, decided to step down as a representative. The sustainability team focused on the longevity of WordPress through social, economic, and environmental aspects. According to a Slack screenshot posted on Reddit, Buijs disagreed with Mullenweg’s approach to advancing WordPress. In response, Mullenweg disbanded the sustainability Slack channel while saying, “Today, I learned we have a sustainability team.” Notably, Mullenweg initiated this channel’s idea during an event in 2022. Mullenweg’s approach to the legal battle with WP Engine has attracted calls for a different kind of leadership in the WordPress world. Last month, Joost de Valk, the creator of Yoast, a popular WordPress SEO tool, outlined a plan to make a “federated” approach to the WordPress repository for decentralized access to assets like plug-ins and themes.

Title: BlackRock part ways with major climate group after being targeted by Republicans for its efforts on global warming

Time Published: 2025-01-10T08:44:42Z
Full Content:
BlackRock Inc. is parting ways with one of the world’s biggest climate-investor groups after being targeted by Republican politicians for its efforts on global warming. The money manager said Thursday in a letter to clients that it decided to leave the Net-Zero Asset Managers initiative. Membership in the group “caused confusion regarding BlackRock’s practices and subjected us to legal inquiries from various public officials,” the New York-based firm said. BlackRock, which oversees more than $11 trillion, has been the subject of attacks from GOP lawmakers for embracing what conservatives call “woke” policies. Most recently, BlackRock was among a group of asset managers singled out in a lawsuit led by Texas, alleging breaches of antitrust laws due to the adoption of pro-climate strategies that suppress coal production. BlackRock also was mentioned, along with firms including State Street Corp. and Vanguard Group Inc., in a report last month from the House Judiciary Committee that said it found “evidence of collusion and anticompetitive behavior” by the financial industry to “impose radical ESG-goals” on US companies. “Our participation in NZAMi didn’t impact the way we managed client portfolios,” BlackRock said in the letter signed by Vice Chairman Philipp Hildebrand and Helen Lees-Jones, global head of sustainable and transition solutions. “Therefore, our departure doesn’t change the way we develop products and solutions for clients or how we manage their portfolios.” BlackRock added that it managed more than $1 trillion in sustainable and transition investment strategies as recently as September and “our commitment to helping our clients achieve their investment goals remains unwavering.” NZAMi is a group of roughly 325 asset managers, overseeing about $50 trillion, that are committed to achieving net zero alignment by 2050. State Street Global Advisors, the world’s third-biggest asset manager, said in an emailed statement on Thursday that it remains a member of NZAMi. Vanguard, the second biggest, left the group in 2022. Over the past month, an equivalent coalition for lenders, the Net-Zero Banking Alliance, has seen a mass exodus of US members. Since early December, NZBA lost Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Wells Fargo & Co., Citigroup Inc., Bank of America Corp., Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase & Co. The moves reflect Wall Street’s desire to shield itself from increasing political pressure as Donald Trump returns to the White House. Earlier this week, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton dropped his threat to cut off the lenders from municipal-bond deals after they quit NZBA. In its statement, BlackRock said its fund managers “continue to assess material climate-related risks, alongside other investment risks, in delivering for clients.” About two-thirds of the firm’s largest clients, including all of its biggest customers in Europe, have made net zero commitments, the money manager said.

(Bloomberg) -- BlackRock Inc. is parting ways with one of the world’s biggest climate-investor groups after being targeted by Republican politicians for its efforts on global warming. Most Read from Bloomberg What Robotaxis Brought San Francisco NYC Condo Owners May Bear Costs of Landmark Green Building Law Ambitious High-Speed Rail Plans Advance in the Baltic Region NYC’s Subway Violence Deters Drive to Bring Workers Back to Office Dutch Central Bank Restores Amsterdam’s ‘Ugliest Building’ The money manager has decided to leave the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative, it said in a letter to clients on Thursday. Membership in the group “caused confusion regarding BlackRock’s practices and subjected us to legal inquiries from various public officials,” the New York-based firm said. BlackRock, which oversees more than $11 trillion, has been the subject of attacks from GOP lawmakers for embracing what conservatives call “woke” policies. Most recently, BlackRock was among a group of asset managers singled out in a lawsuit led by Texas alleging breaches of antitrust laws due to the adoption of pro-climate strategies that suppress coal production. And with President-elect Donald Trump headed for the White House, Wall Street is bracing for more attacks on climate finance. “BlackRock has hung in there as long as it could, but the pressure has become too great, and the reputational and legal risks too high, just before Trump takes office,” Hortense Bioy, head of sustainable investing research at Morningstar Sustainalytics, said in an emailed comment. And it “won’t be the last financial organization to quit a net zero initiative,” she said. BlackRock was mentioned, along with firms including State Street Corp. and Vanguard Group Inc., in a report last month from the House Judiciary Committee that said it found “evidence of collusion and anticompetitive behavior” by the financial industry to “impose radical ESG-goals” on US companies. Over the past month, a climate coalition for lenders, the Net-Zero Banking Alliance, has seen a mass exodus of US members. Since early December, NZBA lost Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Wells Fargo & Co., Citigroup Inc., Bank of America Corp., Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase & Co. The moves reflect Wall Street’s desire to shield itself from increasing GOP pressure. And there are signs the strategy is working. Earlier this week, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton dropped his threat to cut off the lenders from municipal-bond deals after they quit NZBA. “Our participation in NZAMi didn’t impact the way we managed client portfolios,” BlackRock said in Thursday’s letter, which was signed by Vice Chairman Philipp Hildebrand and Helen Lees-Jones, global head of sustainable and transition solutions. “Therefore, our departure doesn’t change the way we develop products and solutions for clients or how we manage their portfolios.” BlackRock said it managed more than $1 trillion in sustainable and transition investment strategies as recently as September and “our commitment to helping our clients achieve their investment goals remains unwavering.” NZAMi is a group of roughly 325 asset managers, overseeing about $50 trillion, that are committed to achieving net zero alignment by 2050. State Street Global Advisors, the world’s third-biggest asset manager, said in an emailed statement on Thursday that it remains a member of NZAMi. Vanguard, the second biggest, left the group in 2022. In its statement, BlackRock said its fund managers “continue to assess material climate-related risks, alongside other investment risks, in delivering for clients.” About two-thirds of the firm’s largest clients, including all of its biggest customers in Europe, have made net zero commitments, the money manager said. BlackRock Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink had been a champion of environmental, social and governance strategies, devoting large parts of his annual letters to urging corporate bosses to pay attention to climate change and other societal issues. But then he came under attack from Republicans and some states collectively pulled billions of dollars from BlackRock. In response, Fink has said he no longer uses the ESG label because it’s become too politicized. Listen on Zero: How to Stop Banks’ Funding of Fossil Fuels, No Protests Required “BlackRock is under political pressure to exit climate groups and from shareholders who are unhappy with the loss of business from state investment funds that object to the agendas of climate groups,” said Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business. --With assistance from Frances Schwartzkopff.

The letter is the latest move in a months-long tug of war between the FDIC and the biggest managers of index-based mutual funds and exchange-traded funds over the rules governing their passive investments in FDIC-regulated banks.

Title: BlackRock Exits UN-Backed Net-Zero Climate Pact
URL: https://www.theepochtimes.com/business/blackrock-exits-un-backed-net-zero-climate-pact-5789222
Time Published: 2025-01-10T05:58:45Z
Full Content:
BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager overseeing approximately $11.5 trillion in assets, has decided to withdraw from a climate pact backed by the United Nations (UN) that advocates for aggressive de-carbonizing of the economy. Membership in the climate pact did not affect the way BlackRock managed client portfolios, according to the spokesperson, but it did lead to confusion about the company’s practices and subjected it to legal inquiries from public officials. Despite the NZAM exit, BlackRock remains committed to sustainable investing. Republicans, particularly from energy-producing states, have criticized the participation of banks and asset managers in net-zero coalitions as part of a progressive agenda and have accused them of antitrust violations. “Texas will not tolerate the illegal weaponization of the financial industry in service of a destructive, politicized ‘environmental’ agenda. BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street formed a cartel to rig the coal market, artificially reduce the energy supply, and raise prices,” Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said in a statement. “This is a stunning violation of State and federal law.” BlackRock has rejected the allegations, stating that the lawsuit undermines investments in essential companies that consumers depend on. “If they want to invest in hydrocarbons, we give them every opportunity to do it–the same way we invest roughly $138 billion in energy transition strategies for our clients,” Fink wrote. “That’s part of being an asset manager. We follow our clients’ mandates.”

Title: Cryptoverse: Next wave of US crypto ETFs already in the pipeline

By Suzanne McGee (Reuters) - What a difference a year makes. Rewind the clock to early January 2024, and the asset-management industry was anxiously watching to see if the much-anticipated debut of U.S. spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds could live up to expectations they would pull in as much as $30 billion in their first year. Today, those issuers are cracking open the champagne. That first wave of bitcoin ETFs attracted a whopping $65 billion in 2024, helping to propel the price of bitcoin from $43,000 to more than $100,000. The largest of those new products, BlackRock (NYSE:BLK)'s iShares Bitcoin Trust, has become the most successful debut in the ETF industry's 35-year history. But that's just the start of the party, cryptocurrency denizens believe. Shortly after those products celebrate their first anniversary on Jan. 10, President-elect Donald Trump - who has pledged to be a crypto president - will be sworn in for the second time, igniting what cryptocurrency fans believe will be a new golden era for the digital asset class. Applications for new, and often novel, crypto products are already piling up in regulators' inboxes. "Everyone is now aware of how much money there is to be made, and with a new, more friendly administration, there's no reason not to go ahead and file your best ideas with regulators," said Joe McCann, founder and CEO of digital assets hedge fund Asymmetric in Miami. While Gary Gensler, Biden's crypto-skeptic Securities and Exchange Commission chair, was forced to approve the first spot bitcoin ETFs - and similar ethereum products - after losing a court challenge, he continued to warn that cryptos are highly volatile and beset by scams and manipulation. Paul Atkins, Trump's appointee to succeed Gensler, is widely seen as a supporter of digital assets. As of late November, companies including VanEck, 21Shares and Canary Capital had seized upon those expectations of an increasingly crypto-friendly tone in Washington by filing at least 16 applications to launch exchange-traded products tracking crypto indices or tokens such as Solana and Ripple's XRP, according to SEC filings and industry sources. LIGHTER REGULATION EXPECTED The push to launch the next wave of crypto products began in earnest weeks before the election, with many in the industry anticipating a lighter regulatory touch regardless of whether Trump or his rival, Vice President Kamala Harris, won. "Since it takes several months to get regulatory approvals and bring an ETF to market, many issuers began making a calculated bet that this year, the climate would be different, and wanted to have their products in the queue ready to go," said Matthew Sigel, head of digital assets research at VanEck, which hopes to launch a Solana ETF in 2025. In addition to XRP and Solana, which are the fourth- and sixth-largest coins by capitalization, according to CoinGecko, Canary has filed to launch products tied to Litecoin and HBAR, less widely held coins, SEC filings show. "The last piece of the puzzle was seeing who the new SEC chair would be - that's what we were banking on," said Steven McClurg, who led the launch of the Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund in January and went on to launch new crypto asset manager Canary Capital in October. "Now, it's off to the races," he added. The looming crypto ETF gold rush is about more than just products tied to single coins, however. New derivative products are poised to make their debut within days of Trump's inauguration, and new kinds of multi-asset or hybrid products are waiting in the wings. Several issuers, including Calamos Investments, Innovator ETFs and First Trust, have filed for new funds that would use recently-launched bitcoin ETF options to shield investors from losses on bitcoin itself. The first ones of those products are expected to debut on Jan. 22, issuers say. The SEC approved options on some of the bitcoin ETFs late last year, including BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust, and gave CBOE Global Markets the green light to launch options tied to the Cboe Bitcoin U.S. ETF Index - clearing the way for this batch of new ETFs. Federico Brokate, head of U.S. business for digital asset manager 21Shares, which has launched U.S. bitcoin and ethereum ETFs, in addition to a wider array of offerings in Europe, predicted other new products could include listed funds tied to baskets of cryptocurrencies or that track a mix of alternative assets, such as bitcoin and gold. "Product innovation in the U.S. is just getting started," he said. To be sure, such novel products are still a gamble. While bitcoin ETFs have outperformed, ETFs launched in July tied to the world's second-largest token, ether, have attracted relatively meager inflows of $12.8 billion, according to Paris-based TrackInsight. While bitcoin's price more than doubled in 2024, ether lagged that pace, gaining 53%. Because less widely-held coins are still in their infancy, factors that drive returns and volatility aren't always clear, said Todd Sohn, ETF analyst at broker-dealer Strategas. While trading in bitcoin and ethereum futures and futures-based ETFs has existed for several years in the U.S., so far those are the only coins for which a futures market exists. Sohn said the existence of futures trading has given regulators confidence in the breadth and depth of both bitcoin and ether. It also remains to be seen how rapidly Atkins will embrace the most novel of the proposed products, given not only the potential risks but the lingering debate over whether or not these tokens are securities that fall within the SEC's purview. Still, that regulatory uncertainty is not dampening the enthusiasm of the crypto asset-management industry. "The only limit on what products emerge will be human creativity," said VanEck's Sigel.

Title: BlackRock Stares Down FDIC Before Deadline Over Bank Stakes

(Bloomberg) -- BlackRock Inc. is resisting the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.’s demands that the world’s largest asset manager submit to new oversight of its stakes in US banks, seeking to delay negotiations into the Trump administration. The FDIC had set a Jan. 10 deadline for BlackRock to sign an agreement. But in a letter to the agency, the company asked for an extension until at least March 31, saying it had only two weeks to review a proposed pact that risks hurting its ability to serve clients. “We are not aware of any imminent or ongoing issues that would warrant hastening the finalization of a completely new regulatory framework in a two-week period,” Ben Tecmire, head of US regulatory affairs at BlackRock, said in the letter obtained by Bloomberg News. The FDIC didn’t immediately provide comment on the letter. BlackRock has opposed FDIC efforts over the past year that seek to keep large asset managers from potentially swaying banks in which they have sizable stakes. It has argued that the plan would upend index funds that dominate many investor portfolios, make it more costly for banks to raise capital and disrupt the economy. Fed Agreement The company said it already has a similar “passivity agreement” in place with the Federal Reserve. FDIC board members Jonathan McKernan, a Republican, and Rohit Chopra, a Democrat and director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, have pushed repeatedly for more oversight of the index fund giants, arguing that their size and concentrated ownership could give firms undue influence over the management and strategy of US banks. BlackRock’s agreement with the FDIC was expected to be similar to Vanguard’s pact announced in late December. In 2019, Vanguard committed to a “passivity agreement” when its funds held more than 10% of the outstanding shares of certain banks. But the latest agreement is more expansive, requiring external and internal audits to verify that Vanguard is not seeking to influence the management or control the board of directors of a lender. It also would cover a broader group of banks. Industry trade groups and BlackRock have said that existing oversight, including by the Fed, already provides assurance that index funds are acting passively rather than exercising control of banks. BlackRock has said the FDIC should coordinate any new scrutiny with the Fed, which already has a passivity agreement in place with the firm. At the end of September, the asset manager had almost $7.8 trillion in exchange-traded funds and index funds. BlackRock, Vanguard Group and State Street Corp. are regularly among the top shareholders in publicly traded US companies, and their index funds’ popularity has boosted their stock ownership, including in banks. Some lawmakers and regulators have warned that the growing scale of these firms allows too much influence over public companies, a view that money managers reject by citing their voting records in support of company management in most situations. In October, BlackRock called on the FDIC to withdraw a proposed rule on asset managers’ stakes in lenders, arguing it presented “significant risks” and could upend how index funds are managed and make it more expensive for banks to raise capital. Less buying interest in bank stocks might hurt the liquidity of their shares and push down their prices, the firm said. (Updates fourth paragraph with outreach to FDIC.)

Subscribe Today's print edition Home Delivery BlackRock, the world's biggest asset manager, said on Thursday it will leave the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, the latest Wall Street firm to depart an environmentally focused investor group under pressure from Republican politicians. BlackRock, which manages some $11.5 trillion, said that with two-thirds of its global clients committed to cutting emissions to net zero, it had made sense to join groups like the organization known as NZAMI. "However, our memberships in some of these organizations have caused confusion regarding BlackRock’s practices and subjected us to legal inquiries from various public officials," leading to the departure, according to a client letter.

By Suzanne McGee and Ross Kerber (Reuters) -BlackRock has asked the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to extend its deadline to reach an agreement on how the agency would oversee the giant asset manager's investments in FDIC-regulated banking organizations from Friday until March 31, according to a letter the firm sent to regulators on Thursday and obtained by Reuters. The letter is the latest move in a months-long tug of war between the FDIC and the biggest managers of index-based mutual funds and exchange-traded funds over the rules governing their passive investments in FDIC-regulated banks. In late December, Vanguard Investments hammered out terms of such a passivity agreement with the FDIC, which immediately afterward asked BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) to sign a very similar agreement by the Friday deadline. "We are not aware of any imminent or ongoing issues that would warrant hastening the finalization of a completely new regulatory framework in a two-week period," wrote Ben Tecmire, head of U.S. regulatory affairs at BlackRock, in the letter to the FDIC. That is especially true, he added, since "all the banks that would be covered by your proposed agreement with BlackRock are subject to regulatory oversight by the Federal Reserve." In the letter, Tecmire said BlackRock wants to avoid "inconsistent and uncertain requirements" that might result from the firm's bank holdings being overseen by multiple bank regulators. He said in the letter that BlackRock's understanding is that the agreement between the FDIC and Vanguard was reached only after several months of negotiation. An individual familiar with the matter said BlackRock's attempts in the final months of 2024 to meet with FDIC officials had been rebuffed. The FDIC did not respond to a request for comment on the letter or the negotiations. GETTING TOO BIG? BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street (NYSE:STT) now collectively control some $26 trillion in assets. Since the financial crisis of 2009 investors have poured money into their low-cost index funds, catapulting the three firms into the ranks of the largest owners of most large U.S. corporations. But their size and clout have raised worries the holdings could diminish competition among the companies they commonly own. Even Vanguard's late founder Jack Bogle voiced concern. Because of the firms' influence on corporate governance, they also have faced political attacks on issues like their treatment of greenhouse gas emissions or workforce diversity. On Thursday, BlackRock said it plans to leave the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative. So far academic studies paint a mixed picture. A 2023 U.S. Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta review for example, found "relatively little evidence" of such problems. Some of the issues the FDIC is grappling with now have also been hashed out in front of the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Trade group Edison Electric Institute cautioned the FERC that its actions have the potential to hamper or delay much-needed capital investments. However, FERC has moved at a much slower pace to consider challenges to the big stakes that the passive funds own in major utilities. One objection is that new limits by regulators could divert investments away from portfolio companies, be they banks or utility firms. Jeff DeMaso, who writes a newsletter for Vanguard investors, said via e-mail that regulators should "tread lightly" before putting new limits on passive mutual funds or ETFs. "We are trying to sort through the unintended consequences of indexing and the concentration of ownership. Before (potentially) damaging that clear good, we should clearly know the problem we are solving," he said.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best Growth Stocks Under $25 to Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Remitly Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:RELY) stands against the other growth stocks. Most experts agree that the AI wave is not over yet. On January 8, Wendy Sheehan Donnell, Editor-in-Chief at PCMag, joined Yahoo Finance from CES 2025 to share her take on trending innovations and the increasing role of artificial intelligence in revolutionizing industries. Donnell unveiled some of the groundbreaking innovations spearheaded by companies from across the globe and emphasized that "AI is the prevailing theme" across all these new products and services. She highlighted the incidence of AI-powered home devices such as smart microwaves and fridges to help people live smarter and tech-immersed lives. She also shed light on the growing role of AI in healthcare and biotechnology, which will contribute to the well-being of people. The market close on Tuesday reiterated a similar pattern where tech stocks continued to shine, however, some analysts expect the market to broaden over the course of 2025. On January 7, Joe Mazzola, head trading and derivatives strategist at Charles Schwab, joined Yahoo Finance, to discuss his market thesis for the tech sector especially. Mazzola suggested that the market breadth was of importance in the earnings season, and pointed towards the strengthening of the US dollar and how it may impact the earnings of tech names. He added that the market needs the other "493 names" in the S&P 500 to catch up. Mazolla also emphasized that while 2025 can be a win for Big Tech like 2024, a broadening would help the overall market immensely in terms of earnings. He added that the financials sector would supposedly catalyze the broadening of the market, because of favorable economic and market conditions. He then discussed the tailwinds for financials and how the same factors serve as headwinds to Big Tech, emphasizing that the bullishness on tech has been slower than it was at the end of 2024. Our Methodology We used Finviz to look for companies operating in growth sectors such as technology, financials (fintech), biotech, and communication services. We only focused on companies with a market cap of at least $2 billion and that gained more than 50% over the past 2 quarters. We then examined the hedge fund sentiment surrounding 25 stocks and picked the 12 stocks that were the most widely held by hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

(NASDAQ:RELY) is a financial services company that allows people to send and receive money online from the United States. The company has a motive to help immigrants in the United States support their families back home, enhancing the sentimental value associated with the brand. In addition to that, the company also funds charities and programs to enhance the financial and social position of immigrants in the United States and their families. Over the years, the company has expanded to Europe, partnered with prominent names, and urged state organizations to enhance the financial and social inclusion of immigrants. Aligning with its goals, Remitly Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:RELY) is leveraging machine learning to prevent fraud and minimize interventions. The company uses ML models to assess and detect thousands of transactions every hour, allowing them to prevent identity theft and credit card fraud with precision. In 2023, the company has been able to reduce the rate of fraud by more than 25% compared to 2022. At the same time, the company saw a 30% decline in its rate of transaction loss. Similarly, on December 10, the company launched a Trust and Safety Center in partnership with Get Safe Online to educate users on fraud and scams online. Investors are bullish on the stock because of its fundamentals, expanding market share, and a solid growth trajectory. Night Watch Investment Management stated the following regarding Remitly Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:RELY) in its Q4 2024 investor letter: “The US consumer has been in a 2-year affordability crisis. As a result, there are many quality consumer businesses available at very attractive prices. However, we don’t currently see a reason why US consumer spending should rebound from its current depressed level. We will therefore limit ourselves to companies with company-specific growth drivers. An example is Remitly Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:RELY) which we acquired around $13 after the stock sold off excessively on an earnings miss in Q1, despite the 30% growth on the back of market share gains. Valuation is very attractive when considering that marketing expenses are a discretionary reinvestment into the business.” Overall RELY ranks 6th on our list of the best growth stocks under $25 to buy now. While we acknowledge the potential of RELY as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than RELY but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: BlackRock drops out of progressive ‘Net Zero’ initiative as pressure grows to ditch ‘woke’ groups

BlackRock is officially out of the so-called “Net Zero” coalition of top corporations who pledge to reach zero-carbon emissions by 2050 – a significant blow to the corporate push to embrace progressive policies on energy conservation, On The Money has learned. The investment giant, led by billionaire CEO Larry Fink, announced in a letter to clients on Thursday that it is leaving the United Nations-sponsored “Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative” as pressure grows on big corporations to reverse their woke business agendas. BlackRock said its “involvement in organizations where various companies pledge efforts to reduce carbon emissions subjected us to legal inquiries from various public officials. Following our routine review of our continued participation in these groups, we are writing to notify of our formal withdrawal from the Net Zero Asset Managers (NZAM) initiative,” according to the letter, which was obtained by On The Money. On The Money reported earlier this week that Fink was poised to leave the Net Zero Initiative. The exit comes as others have announced plans to leave a sister UN coalition for mega banks. In recent days, the nation’s largest banks – JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Citigroup and Morgan Stanley – said they are dropping their membership from the UN climate coalition. BlackRock’s departure is more significant. The world’s largest investment fund, with more than $10 trillion in assets under management, was a leader in so-called ESG, or Environmental Social Governance investing. Fink and other top executives had evangelized on the need to use the company’s investing might to force corporations to reduce their carbon footprint, joining Net Zero in 2021. But soon thereafter, a swift political backlash developed; sustainable energy investing faced stiff opposition from GOP politicians who ran large state pension funds in red states such as Texas and Florida. Rising inflation came after the COVID lockdowns ended, and higher gas prices following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine made sustainability efforts politically toxic.

Members of Congress even suggested that the NetZero Alliance violated antitrust laws since it forced corporations to operate in concert to achieve what they called dubious aims of climate sustainability while causing working class people to suffer.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best Growth Stocks Under $25 to Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Lumen Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:LUMN) stands against the other growth stocks. Most experts agree that the AI wave is not over yet. On January 8, Wendy Sheehan Donnell, Editor-in-Chief at PCMag, joined Yahoo Finance from CES 2025 to share her take on trending innovations and the increasing role of artificial intelligence in revolutionizing industries. Donnell unveiled some of the groundbreaking innovations spearheaded by companies from across the globe and emphasized that "AI is the prevailing theme" across all these new products and services. She highlighted the incidence of AI-powered home devices such as smart microwaves and fridges to help people live smarter and tech-immersed lives. She also shed light on the growing role of AI in healthcare and biotechnology, which will contribute to the well-being of people. The market close on Tuesday reiterated a similar pattern where tech stocks continued to shine, however, some analysts expect the market to broaden over the course of 2025. On January 7, Joe Mazzola, head trading and derivatives strategist at Charles Schwab, joined Yahoo Finance, to discuss his market thesis for the tech sector especially. Mazzola suggested that the market breadth was of importance in the earnings season, and pointed towards the strengthening of the US dollar and how it may impact the earnings of tech names. He added that the market needs the other "493 names" in the S&P 500 to catch up. Mazolla also emphasized that while 2025 can be a win for Big Tech like 2024, a broadening would help the overall market immensely in terms of earnings. He added that the financials sector would supposedly catalyze the broadening of the market, because of favorable economic and market conditions. He then discussed the tailwinds for financials and how the same factors serve as headwinds to Big Tech, emphasizing that the bullishness on tech has been slower than it was at the end of 2024. Our Methodology We used Finviz to look for companies operating in growth sectors such as technology, financials (fintech), biotech, and communication services.

We then examined the hedge fund sentiment surrounding 25 stocks and picked the 12 stocks that were the most widely held by hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

Title: Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) the Best Technology Stock to Invest In for the Long Term

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best Technology Stocks to Invest In for the Long Term. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other technology stocks. On January 1, King Lip, BakerAvenue Wealth Management's chief strategist and partner, joined CNBC's 'Closing Bell' to discuss market outlooks as we enter 2025. His focus was on the impressive performance of tech stocks in 2024, with expectations for a second consecutive year of double-digit gains. Lip was against the prevailing sentiment among investors that big tech has peaked and that funds should rotate into smaller stocks or other themes. He argued that the recent weakness in the tech sector is largely due to technical rebalancing rather than a fundamental downturn. He emphasized that cash is likely to flow back into leading tech stocks, as they are projected to deliver the highest earnings growth in 2025, with an anticipated earnings increase of over 20%. Discussing high valuations in the tech sector, particularly for large-cap stocks trading at forward earnings multiples between 32 and 35 times, Lip countered that many valuations remain within one standard deviation of their historical norms over the past decade. He pointed out that the MAG7 have consistently provided strong returns and are well-positioned for future growth. Lip identified Broadcom as a top stock, praising its management under Hock Tan and its unique role in the market as a provider of custom AI chips. He noted that the company operates at a lower earnings multiple while benefiting from substantial growth. Lip also discussed Palantir, which has garnered attention for its profitability and positive cash flow since becoming profitable two years ago; despite its high valuation exceeding 50 times revenue, he believes it is well-positioned to benefit from government spending cuts and AI initiatives. While acknowledging concerns about insider selling and high valuations for the company, Lip remains optimistic about its future potential, suggesting it could be more appealing if it drops to the mid-$60 range. Lip is bullish on tech stocks in 2025 that will be driven by strong earnings growth and ongoing investments in AI infrastructure. The NASDAQ 100 index has performed remarkably well, achieving a return of 27% in 2024 following a staggering 53.8% return in 2023. This reflects a broader trend where major tech companies have outperformed traditional indices significantly, and with that being acknowledged, we're here with a list of the 12 best technology stocks to invest in for the long term. To identify the best long-term tech stocks according to media, we sifted through financial media reports and watched Wall Street analysts' appearances on the news. We compiled a preliminary list of 25 stocks first and then selected 12 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q3 2024. The hedge fund data was sourced from Insider Monkey’s database which tracks the moves of over 900 elite money managers. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 158 Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company known for its consumer electronics, including the iPhone, iPad, Mac computers, Apple Watches, and AirPods. It has a loyal customer base, and its subscription services, including Apple Music and Apple TV+, are experiencing significant growth. While China has historically been a significant market for the company, it experienced a 7.7% year-over-year sales decline in FY24. India, on the other hand, achieved record revenue in FQ4 2024. Despite headwinds, its strong brand loyalty and continuous innovation efforts position it well for long-term growth. Apple's Services revenue reached an all-time high of $25 billion in FQ4 2024, a 12% year-over-year increase, particularly attributed to the App Store. This diversification lessens its dependence on hardware sales. Still, the launch of the iPhone 16, with its AI-powered features, is anticipated to fuel significant demand. Analysts project 90 million units of the iPhone 16 to be sold in 2025. Mar Vista Strategic Growth Strategy viewed AAPL stock positively due to investor enthusiasm for its AI roadmap and iPhone 16 launch. Here's what is said regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock was strong in the quarter as investors viewed the company’s generative AI roadmap and iPhone 16 product cycle positively. The market was reminded of the strength of the Apple ecosystem as management demonstrated how generative AI solutions would be integrated into its iOS 18 operating system, which was broadly released in the iPhone 16 late in calendar Q3. We believe Apple’s generative AI-enabled products should spur a meaningful iPhone upgrade cycle and create new avenues of monetization through its app store and advertising offerings. We believe this will support intrinsic value growth that will range between high single digits and low double-digits over our investment horizon.” Overall AAPL ranks 7th on our list of the best technology stocks to invest in for the long term. As we acknowledge the growth potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: BlackRock Exits Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative

Time Published: 2025-01-09T21:11:29Z

BlackRock will leave the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative, an investor group committed to achieving net-zero portfolios by 2050 or sooner across all assets under management, a spokesperson for BlackRock confirmed to CIO. The initiative counts more than 325 signatories representing $57.5 trillion in AUM. BlackRock joined the NZAM initiative in March 2021. In the firm’s 2030 net-zero statement, BlackRock anticipates at least 75% of its client assets under management to be invested in “issuers with science-based targets or equivalent.” “We are disappointed to see any investor withdraw, but as a voluntary initiative, we respect any individual decisions signatories take,” a spokesperson for the Net Zero Asset Manager initiative said via email. “Climate risk is financial risk. NZAM exists to help investors mitigate these risks and to realize the benefits of the economic transition to net zero.” The exit comes as similar climate investing groups have seen scores of members leave. The Net-Zero Banking Alliance has seen nearly all major U.S. banks, including JPMorganChase, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs leave the initiative. Want the latest institutional investment industry news and insights? Sign up for CIO newsletters.  The Climate Action 100+ investor network had also had dozens of high-profile departures, including State Street, J.P. Morgan Asset Management, PIMCO, Franklin Templeton, Nuveen and Goldman Sachs Asset Management, among others. A pushback against environmental, social and governance-based investing and principles is likely to blame for the exodus. Opponents of ESG investing, including many Republicans in Congress and state-elected officials, say the focus of investment managers should be to maximize returns on their investments and that such ESG targets are not aligned with fiduciary duty to their clients. This view has led to a number of states banning their public funds from making ESG investments. In December, the Ohio Legislature banned pension fund and university endowments in the state from making “investment decisions with the primary purpose of influencing any social or environmental policy or attempting to influence the governance of any corporation.” The legislation also bans funds from engaging in shareholder activism. BlackRock has been a frequent target by Republican politicians over what the politicians say is an overcommitment to ESG. A number of states have divested from BlackRock over these concerns, including Texas and the Texas Permanent School Fund, which divested $8.5 billion in assets from the firm. In December, 11 states filed a complaint against BlackRock, State Street and Vanguard, accusing the trio of conspiring to suppress the coal market through their significant ownership of coal stocks. That complaint also cited the three firms being signatories to the NZAM initiative and accused the trio of pursuing ESG strategies in non-ESG funds. Last month, BlackRock was terminated as a nearly $1 billion fixed-income manager by the $46 billion Indiana Public Retirement System; under Indiana law, state pension funds cannot invest in managers or service providers determined to have made an ESG commitment. BlackRock’s status as a signatory to the NZAM initiative was cited by Indiana State Treasurer Dan Elliott as such a commitment. “NZAM has successfully helped raise the level of ambition across investors globally and supported their progress as they have sought to navigate their own individual paths toward a decarbonizing economy in line with their long-term financial objectives and fiduciary duties,” the NZAM spokesperson said. “We look forward to continuing to play this constructive role.” Related Stories: Vanguard Withdraws from Net Zero Group After State Pressure Institutional Investors Reaffirm Support for Climate Action 100+ Following Departures Indiana Fund Narrows Finalists to Replace BlackRock Tags: BlackRock, ESG, Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, NZAM « Northwestern Mutual to Take Stake in Sixth Street, Form Investment Partnership

Title: Is Visa Inc. (V) the Best Blue Chip Stock to Buy for 2025?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Best Blue Chip Stocks to Buy for 2025. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) stands against other best blue chip stocks to buy for 2025. Both conservative and risk-tolerant investors favor blue chip stocks due to their solid business models, impressive track records, and attractive risk-reward profiles. These stocks are backed by companies with strong brand names and reputations that generate dependable earnings and consistent dividends, which provide stability and passive income during turbulent market conditions. In recent years, Wall Street has become reliant on the best blue chip stocks. While the S&P 500 was up by about 24% in 2024, most of the gains were driven by gains in seven of the biggest blue chip stocks. The “Magnificent 7” stocks, which include seven of the biggest companies by market cap, accounted for a 13.7% point gain in the S&P 500. Therefore, investors who focused on these stocks ended up generating significant gains. READ ALSO: Billionaire Israel Englander’s Top 10 Stock Picks Heading Into 2025 and 15 Stocks Targeted By Activist Hedge Funds. The trend is not expected to change in 2025. Blue chip companies should be the biggest beneficiary as the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates and the new administration under Donald Trump pushes for fewer regulations. The easing of regulatory pressure that has taken a significant toll on tech giants should be a boon to see blue chip stocks edge even higher. David Miller, co-founder at Catalyst Funds, expects blue chip stocks to continue leading the way in 2025. “The Mag 7 stocks are generating significant growth in terms of revenue and earnings power,” he said earlier this month. “These companies are massive monopoly businesses with strong fundamental tail winds. I have no reason to believe that the Mag 7 names won’t continue to dominate the S&P in 2025.” Valuations among the blue-chip stocks have gotten out of hand after two years of blockbuster gains amid the artificial intelligence frenzy. Blue chip companies boast significant profits and a competitive edge to back their valuations up, however. “The Magnificent Seven are not pie-in-the-sky companies: They’re generating “tremendous” revenue for investors”, said Fitzgerald, principal and founding member of Moisand Fitzgerald Tamayo. “How much more gain can be made is the question,” he added. Therefore, any well-diversified investment portfolio should include some of the best blue chip stocks. It’s the only way investors can take advantage of the market rally that’s driven by various factors, including the artificial intelligence frenzy, robust economic growth and friendly monetary policy. To make our list of the 10 best blue chip stocks to buy for 2025, we analyzed the market, focusing on large market cap companies (more than $100 billion) with well-established, financially sound businesses. We then examined their performance over the past year, focusing on the underlying fundamentals that make them stand out. Finally, we ranked these companies in ascending order based on their 12-month return in 2024. At Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A close-up of a credit card being swiped on a payment terminal, reflecting the company's payments technology. Market Cap as of January 8: $605.34 Billion Past Year Gain (2024): 19% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 165 Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) is a payment technology company that offers VisaNet, a transaction processing network that enables authorization, clearing, and settlement of payment transactions. While the company operates in a highly cyclical sector susceptible to varying economic conditions, its stock has remained resilient. The competitive edge stems from the company’s focus on payment facilitation and operating the world’s biggest credit card network. It collaborates with 14,500 financial institution partners and powers 4.5 billion cards globally. The massive network allowed the company to process almost $16 trillion in payments last year. Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) generates significant revenues in fees regardless of prevailing economic conditions. In contrast, its other peers that engage in lending suffer immensely during recessions on having to cover for loan losses and delinquencies. Additionally, Visa’s edge stems from expanding its footprint across the globe. It remains one of the best blue chip stocks to buy, as the company has enjoyed sustained double-digit growth in cross-border volume in emerging markets. Since going public in 2008, the company has distributed dividends. It currently distributes a quarterly dividend of $0.52 per share, translating to a 0.73% yield. Although the yield might not seem impressive, Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) has a solid dividend-raising history, 15 years and counting. Montaka Global Investments stated the following regarding Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “Montaka owns several duopolists in the financial services industry, including Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) and Mastercard in payments; and S&P Global in credit ratings and financial data services. These businesses have competitively protected and reliably growing core businesses. But they also have newer, high-probability adjacent opportunities. The market, however, is underappreciating this powerful combination, in our view. Overall, V ranks 9th on our list of best blue chip stocks to buy for 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of V as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than V but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Private Lenders Set to Take Over Alacrity in Debt Restructuring

(Bloomberg) -- Direct lenders including Antares Capital, Blue Owl Capital Inc and KKR & Co are preparing to take over insurance claims manager Alacrity Solutions, the latest restructuring in the private credit market, according to people with knowledge of the matter. BlackRock Inc. is set to hand over control of the company to its lenders less than two years after it purchased a 70% majority stake in the firm from Kohlberg & Co., said the people who asked not to be identified as the details are private. BlackRock’s existing equity investment will be completely wiped out, the people said, adding the firm invested about $560 million in equity at the time through its Long Term Private Capital strategy. Alacrity’s debt load, which was already in place when BlackRock purchased the stake, includes a roughly $1 billion unitranche from direct lenders and a more than $500 million junior capital piece from Goldman Sachs Asset Management, the people said. Alacrity, which handles insurance claims through a network of adjusters, struggled as weather-related claims dwindled, Bloomberg reported. More insurance companies have also brought adjusting services in-house, curtailing the company’s client base. Now, those same lenders are ready to become the owners. First-lien holders will end up owning around 90% of the company under the restructuring plan, while the junior-capital provider GSAM will get the remaining piece, the people said. Antares, Blue Owl, KKR and the other lenders will convert about half of their loan into equity, while also providing about $175 million of new debt in the form of a revolving credit facility and a delayed-draw term loan, they said. Alacrity’s capital structure will include an about $450 million term loan and $250 million of preferred equity. Alacrity said it’s in a new financing accord with existing financial partners in a press release. The deal is expected to close in the first quarter, while operations will remain unaffected in the interim, according to the statement. An Alacrity spokesperson declined to provide further details on the financing. Representatives for Antares, BlackRock, Blue Owl and GSAM declined to comment. KKR didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment on the additional financing details, but had declined to comment on the deal previously. It’s the latest large restructuring to come to light in the private credit world in the past 12 months, as companies continue to grapple with higher rates and private credit managers struggle to stay ahead of potential losses. Pluralsight Inc., an educational-software company, restructured last year and lenders took the keys to the business. Some market participants have warned of increased stress, as interest-rate relief keeps being pushed back. Private lenders are often able to stay ahead of restructurings and defaults by quietly amending loans and finding other solutions. However, even those back-door strategies have been put to the test in recent months. BlackRock is working with Evercore Inc., while Centerview Partners and AlixPartners are advising Alacrity, Bloomberg previously reported. The unitranche direct lenders are being advised by Latham & Watkins and FTI Consulting Inc. (Updates starting in second paragraph with further financing details.)

Title: As Los Angeles Burns, Conspiracy Peddlers Lie About—and Celebrate—the Danger We’re Living Through
URL: https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2025/01/los-angeles-fires-conspiracies/
Time Published: 2025-01-09T20:39:10Z

Mother Jones illustration; Getty For the last two mornings, I’ve woken up from broken sleep in my house on Los Angeles’ east side in a blind panic, the smell of smoke permeating the air. The light slanting in is a horrible, eerie orange, illuminating the white kitchen cabinets like a nightmare projection screen. When I climb onto the roof, the air in every direction is full of dark, low, menacing clouds fed by smoke, blocking out the mountains and trees even just a few miles away. Every wildfire is accused of not being a wildfire, but a planned attack to further sinister ends. Our car is packed. Our important documents are in a tote bag by the back door. Every ping from the Watch Duty app, which sends out real-time fire alerts, sends me scrambling for my phone. I’m anxiously scrutinizing the perimeter of the Eaton fire, which has destroyed the homes of friends and community landmarks I love, willing it not to jump the 134 highway, praying today will be the day that helitankers will be able to slow the spread. I watch helplessly as the other fires across town engulf homes, businesses, send pets and livestock fleeing alone, reduce lives and memories to ash. I pray the death toll doesn’t mount higher. I watch friends and acquaintances on Instagram reporting from where they’ve evacuated, haggard and blank-faced with shock in hotel rooms and packed cars. I don’t know what kind of city we’ll have waiting for us on the other side of this. Naturally, then, as a journalist who’s covered conspiracy theories and disinformation for many years, it’s been reassuring to learn that the disaster threatening my safety can be blamed on false flag attacks, Democrat plotting, the evils of diversity, and—say it with me—the Jews. A disaster is a ripe moment for conspiracy peddlers to ply their wares, and a historic series of fires threatening a major city—especially one filled with Democrats, non-white people and wealthy celebrities—has sent the machine into overdrive. The theories being spread about the Los Angeles fires, as Nitish Pahwa wrote yesterday, are a mix of climate change denialism and attempts to pin the disasters on their usual and preferred villains. Perhaps most disturbing of all, they also contain an ugly dose of celebration and schadenfreude. “The Hollywood Hills are on fire,” are burning, tweeted an account associated with the network of Stew Peters, a far-right and deeply antisemitic podcaster. “It’s almost poetic.” Some of the themes emerging are consistent: pretty much every wildfire is accused of not being a wildfire at all, but a planned attack meant to further some sinister end. This serves two purposes: casting doubt on the established science of climate change, and finding a more politically useful target to pin a disaster on. Conspiracy peddlers blamed the devastating 2018 wildfires in Northern California on “directed energy weapons,” a tidy mix of climate change skepticism blended with endless paranoia about what the government is capable of perpetrating on its own citizens. Typically, proponents’ “evidence” for this will be claiming that the fire is displaying unusual or suspicious behavior, unlike a “normal” fire. Those ideas quickly surfaced this week: Stew Peters, for instance, claimed that in some firestruck areas “none of the bushes and trees were disturbed at all” and the “lawns are still green,” adding, “the government wants to kill you and then they want to steal your land.” (This is, needless to say, simple bullshit: landscaping, brush, hedges and lawns have all been very much “disturbed” in fire-damaged areas.) “[O]ur Government who is working hand in glove with the WEF and Blackrock, is PURPOSELY setting fires using Military grade DEWs in these areas to initiate a MASSIVE LAND GRAB,” read another post representative of the theory, made on X by someone calling himself The Patriot Voice. Their account is verified, meaning that the user pays for Twitter and thus has the visibility of their posts and replies boosted on the site. The post has so far been viewed 180,000 times. The other common target from far-right conspiracists has been “DEI initiatives,” as a way of pushing the idea that Los Angeles’ fire and emergency services are somehow too woke to effectively fight fires, with characters like Chaya Raichik of Libs of TikTok devoting endless tweets to the fact that the Los Angeles Fire Department chief Kristin M. Crowley is a lesbian. As with a lot of conspiracy theories, the particular line of attack has been repeated by other more mainstream sources, including the Daily Wire, ex-Fox host Megyn Kelly, and the Federalist, who proclaimed that the LAFD is “DEI-crazed” and thus “made the fires worse.” Blogger Beth Brelje objected to the fact that the LAFD’s strategic plan didn’t use the word “hydrant” but talked about diversity and sustainability. While the plan doesn’t use that particular word and does include such projects, it discusses a wide range of goals in the sprawling department, including wildfire fighting preparedness. Fire hydrants near the Pacific Palisades fire didn’t run dry because of diversity; they ran dry because of an enormous demand for water to fight fires. Infowars and a variety of other conspiracy sites also claimed that the LAFD was flat-footed because “most of their supplies were sent to Ukraine,” a claim repeated by Donald Trump Jr. In fact, the LAFD sent surplus equipment to Ukraine three years ago, part of a national effort by fire departments to send aid. The “hoses, nozzles, turnouts, helmets, body armor, and other associated personal protective equipment” scrounged up, per the release, was packed up into just five pallets of gear, per a news story at the time—an amount irrelevant to what’s been needed to battle the current, devastating blazes. Some longtime conspiracy peddlers opted to take a more blanket approach, throwing out a list of buzzwords rather than pin responsibility for the fires on any one source. “Communist China sabotage teams?,” tweeted far-right personality and Pizzagate promoter Mike Cernovich. “Druggies? Random criminals doing arson? In Soros County LA, you can never know who is lighting these fires.” Despite the ugliness that I see every time I look at my phone for too long, out in the real world, there have been moments of beauty and solidarity. I’m on a text chain with my closest neighbors, which has been full of advice, gentle check-ins, and moments of delirious celebration: when work crews got our power turned back on we joked about who’d be the first outside to meet them with a bottle of tequila. (They vanished before I could dig out the good stuff, sadly.) Astonishingly, we’ve gotten regular mail deliveries; our mask-wearing mail carrier cheerfully greeted me with some letters, and told me, “I’m just pretending like it’s snow,” gesturing at the ash falling on our heads. Friends and acquaintances and family and total strangers have checked in, some offering their addresses as places to go. My brother-in-law offered to get in the car and drive to me. In the midst of a disaster, there are always moments of genuine warmth and solidarity. But none of them come from the people who are in the business of peddling fear and panic.

Title: Is PG&E Corporation (PCG) the Best Utility Stock to Buy According to Hedge Funds?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best Utility Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where PG&E Corporation (NYSE:PCG) stands against the other utility stocks. The rapid growth of artificial intelligence (AI) is putting an unprecedented strain on the power grid. One of the primary concerns is the unpredictable nature of AI demand. Unlike traditional industries, AI companies are experiencing exponential growth, making it difficult for utilities to forecast and plan for energy demand. This uncertainty is further complicated as the regulatory framework governing utilities is also a significant obstacle to addressing the energy crisis. Utilities are required to petition regulators for approval to invest in new infrastructure, which can be a time-consuming and uncertain process. This has led to a situation where utilities are unable to invest in the infrastructure needed to support the growth of AI, exacerbating the energy crisis. Read Also: 15 Energy Infrastructure Stocks That Are Skyrocketing and 12 Best Middle East and Africa Stocks To Buy Right Now. In an interview with CNBC on December 6, Nicholas Campanella, Senior Equity Research Analyst at Barclays, discussed the growing demand for power to support the increasing needs of data centers and the tech industry. Campanella forecasts that the US would face a shortage of resources to meet this demand, making nuclear power an attractive option. Campanella cited the fact that gas turbines are largely sold out between now and 2029, and limited ability to bring on new renewables between now and 2026-2027. Campanella emphasized that the growing demand for power from data centers and hyperscalers would drive up demand for nuclear energy. Given the recent surge in their price, Campanella highlighted that investors should still buy stocks in utility and independent power-producing companies involved in nuclear power, citing the growing mismatch between supply and demand for power in the late decade. According to Campanella, utility companies that have nuclear assets are well-positioned to capitalize on this trend, particularly those with early site permits or Combined Operating Licenses. Campanella pointed out that the last nuclear renaissance had left several sites with existing permits, which could be leveraged to expedite the development of new nuclear facilities. He forecasts that additional large-scale and Small Modular Reactor (SMR) commitments will be made in 2025. The growing energy demands driven by the rapid expansion of artificial intelligence and data centers present opportunities for investors, particularly in utility companies. With that in context, let’s take a look at the 12 best utility stocks to buy according to hedge funds. Our Methodology For this article, we used the Finviz and Yahoo stock screeners to find the 40 largest utility companies. We then used Insider Monkey’s Hedge Fund database to rank 10 stocks according to the largest number of hedge fund holders, as of Q3 2024. The list is sorted in ascending order of hedge fund sentiment. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Brightly-lit nighttime view of an electricity power grid with distribution lines and transmission substations. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 49 PG&E Corporation (NYSE:PCG), headquartered in San Francisco, is the parent company of Pacific Gas and Electric Company. The company serves approximately 16 million customers in Northern and Central California. PG&E Corporation (NYSE:PCG) generates electricity through a mix of natural gas, nuclear, hydroelectric, and renewable resources. PG&E Corporation (NYSE:PCG) is actively expanding its capital investment plan to meet the growing demand for energy infrastructure in California. The company recently added $1 billion to its five-year capital plan, bringing the total to $63 billion through 2028. This additional investment is a direct response to the increasing customer demand for electrification, from housing developments to electric vehicle (EV) charging stations, data centers, and commercial projects. The capital is designed to enhance the reliability and resilience of the company’s infrastructure while ensuring that these investments are affordable for customers and accretive to the company's earnings. Additionally, PG&E Corporation (NYSE:PCG) is exploring innovative solutions to leverage new load in ways that benefit the grid. One notable example is the partnership with the Open School District and Zoom to deploy the nation's largest bidirectional electric school bus fleet. This fleet is equipped with vehicle-to-grid technology, allowing the buses to return energy to the grid when not in use. Overall PCG ranks 5th on our list of the best utility stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of PCG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than PCG but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: CA Tax Loophole Benefits Oil and Gas Companies, Undermines Firefighting Revenue

California’s oil and gas companies avoided paying billions of dollars in taxes that could have been used to fight the inferno. Fossil fuel companies are profiting off an obscure state tax break depriving California of up to $146 million of annual tax revenue that could be used to combat climate change-fueled wildfires, according to a new report released amid an inferno tearing through Los Angeles. The tax break has persisted for decades in the Democrat-controlled state even as California has faced deficits and cuts to wildfire preparedness — including recent cuts to the Los Angeles Fire Department’s budget. During the first night of the fires, firefighters struggled to obtain water from fire hydrants in Pacific Palisades, a neighborhood that had been set ablaze in western Los Angeles. A city council member who represents the Palisades neighborhood blamed the lack of water on “chronic underinvestment.” Just sign up below for a free subscription to The Lever to get access to this story and much more.

Title: BlackRock quits climate group in Wall Street's latest environmental step-back

By Ross Kerber (Reuters) - BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), the world's biggest asset manager, said on Thursday it will leave the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, the latest Wall Street firm to depart an environmentally focused investor group under pressure from Republican politicians. BlackRock, which manages some $11.5 trillion, said that with two-thirds of its global clients committed to cutting emissions to net zero, it had made sense to join groups like the organization known as NZAMI. "However, our memberships in some of these organizations have caused confusion regarding BlackRock’s practices and subjected us to legal inquiries from various public officials," leading to the departure, according to a client letter reviewed by Reuters. Its departure, BlackRock said, "does not change the way we develop products and solutions for clients or how we manage their portfolios." The firm said its active portfolio managers "continue to assess material climate-related risks." NZAMI members pledge to support the goal of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, using influence such as how they vote their proxies at corporate meetings. The group currently counts more than 325 signatories managing more than $57.5 trillion, according to its website. Major Wall Street lenders have left a similar climate organization for banks in recent weeks ahead of the return of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump and as his fellow Republicans take control of Congress. While the departures may not have a direct effect on lending or share purchases, the companies' participation was seen as a marker of investors' environmental priorities. In December the Republican-led U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Committee sought information from BlackRock and dozens of other asset managers involved with NZAMI. In November BlackRock and rivals were sued by Texas and 10 other Republican-led states that claimed their activism cut coal production and boosted energy prices. BlackRock has denied wrongdoing and said the lawsuit "discourages investments in the companies consumers rely on." BlackRock's exit so far has not prompted others to follow. Representatives for two of its rivals, the asset management arms of State Street (NYSE:STT) and JPMorgan, said on Thursday they remain NZAMI members. Another major passive fund manager, Vanguard, left the group in 2022. A NZAMI spokesperson via email called any investor withdrawal disappointing. "Climate risk is financial risk. NZAM exists to help investors mitigate these risks and to realise the benefits of the economic transition to net zero," the spokesperson said. Leslie Samuelrich, president of Green Century Funds, oversaw her firm's departure from NZAMI in 2023 even though it avoids oil and coal stocks. On Thursday she called the departures by bigger firms "disheartening" since their memberships showed investors want lower-carbon portfolios. "This is short sighted given the stark realities of climate change and the need to push for environmentally responsible actions in corporate America," Samuelrich said. CLEANING THINGS UP Efforts such as NZAMI, which was created in 2020 and boosted by a 2021 United Nations climate conference, began without controversy as world leaders looked for ways to harness capital to transition the world to cleaner energy sources. But U.S. Republican officials, many from energy-producing states, have disparaged the efforts as "woke capital" claiming they violate antitrust laws. In a statement sent by a representative, Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan called BlackRock's departure "a huge win for freedom and American prosperity. All U.S. financial institutions should follow suit and abandon the climate cartel and woke ESG policies," using an acronym referring to investor consideration of environmental, social and governance factors. In its client letter, BlackRock said its sustainable-investment efforts are "driven by the needs of our clients and our continued investment conviction that the energy transition is a mega force shaping economies and markets."

Title: AVITA Medical, Inc. (RCEL): A Bull Case Theory

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We came across a bullish thesis on AVITA Medical, Inc. (NASDAQ:RCEL) on Substack by Steve Wagner. In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on RCEL. AVITA Medical, Inc. (NASDAQ:RCEL)'s share was trading at $8.94 as of Jan 8th. A doctor interacting with a patient, discussing the progress of their treatment. Avita Medical (NASDAQ:RCEL) has recently secured FDA approval for its new RECELL GO mini, a disposable cartridge designed specifically for treating smaller wounds up to 480 square centimeters. This innovative product fills a critical gap in the wound care market, particularly for high-volume, smaller wounds typically encountered in trauma and burn centers. Unlike the standard RECELL GO, which is capable of treating wounds up to 1,920 square centimeters, the mini version uses the same multi-use processing device but with an optimized cartridge for smaller skin samples. This adjustment leads to reduced resource consumption and waste, making the product more cost-effective, a key consideration for hospitals facing budget constraints. The RECELL GO mini approval is a strategic move for Avita, allowing the company to expand its reach into a segment of the market previously underserved by its standard offering. This smaller version targets trauma centers that previously could not justify the use of the standard RECELL GO due to the size of their patients' wounds. By providing a more versatile, smaller-scale solution, Avita aims to lower the barriers to adoption, encouraging trauma centers to integrate the RECELL GO platform into their treatments. This should drive increased product uptake, particularly in facilities that treat smaller wounds, which are common in trauma and burn cases. Avita plans to begin rolling out the RECELL GO mini in Q1 2025, aligning the product launch with hospital budgeting cycles. This timing could expedite adoption, as healthcare facilities often make purchasing decisions at the start of the fiscal year. With the U.S. burn care market alone valued at over $2 billion, Avita is positioning itself to capture a larger share of the market by offering a solution that covers a wider range of wound sizes. The mini cartridge’s efficiency, which reduces waste and optimizes resources, should help hospitals manage costs while improving patient care. For Avita Medical, the approval of RECELL GO mini is expected to drive significant revenue growth by attracting new customers and expanding sales within existing accounts. By offering a more practical, size-specific solution, the company stands to improve its margins through more efficient use of resources, while increasing adoption across trauma and burn centers. This strategic product expansion enhances Avita’s market positioning, and as the company continues to roll out the RECELL GO mini, it is likely to see positive financial results, making it an attractive investment opportunity.

Title: Funding Rates Down: Is Bitcoin Heading For A $90K Correction?

Bitcoin’s recent price fluctuations have left investors in a state of uncertainty, as the cryptocurrency has seen a dramatic decline from its peak of nearly $107,000 to around $94,550. This volatility raises essential questions about the ability of Bitcoin to maintain its rally and whether it can regain its footing in the coming weeks. CryptoQuant analyst Shayan has had something important to say about current conditions in Bitcoins. According to him, the price is trying to stabilize right above the value of $92,000 level, which he further says is a key support. He notes that Bitcoin is stabilizing near the $92,000 mark, which he identifies as a crucial support zone. If Bitcoin breaks below this level, it could trigger a wave of long liquidations and push prices down toward the 100-day moving average of $81,000. Also, this line has been performing as a real dynamic support by attracting buying inflows and can also cushion prices during further descent. Shayan underlines the role of market sentiment and technical indicators. At present, Bitcoin is fluctuating at significant support levels which are created in the $90K level and Fibonacci retracement levels at $87K and $82K. If the above-mentioned levels do not hold, there could be further selling pressure with corrections. Amidst this uncertainty, renowned cryptocurrency analyst Crypto Rover has expressed a bullish outlook for Bitcoin. He recently compared today’s price action with historical patterns, suggesting that January could see positive trends for Bitcoin. #Bitcoin history is exactly repeating. January will turn green. You’ll regret not buying more here. pic.twitter.com/DCssLNMGh6 — Crypto Rover (@rovercrc) January 8, 2025 In a tweet, he stated, “Bitcoin history is exactly repeating. January will turn green. You’ll regret not buying more here.” His analysis indicates that if Bitcoin can break through the critical resistance level of $100,000, it could potentially barrel past $107,000. Rover’s positivity is strengthened by the huge capital inflows in Bitcoin ETFs, which attracted more than $900 million of inflows from institutions like BlackRock and Fidelity. Increasing institutional interest also signals confidence in the long-term prospect of Bitcoin. However, he also cautions that failure to close above the $100,000 mark will lead to a pullback to $92,000 or even lower. The broader cryptocurrency market is feeling the strain too. This decline comes in tandem with Bitcoin’s failure to stay afloat, and other cryptocurrencies such as Ether and Solana have fallen by more than 7%. Even the traditional stocks of the crypto sector, such as MicroStrategy and Coinbase, have been down sharply. Funding rates falling within the derivatives market adds yet another layer of bearish sentiment around Bitcoin. According to Shayan, the decreasing funding rates had reflected dipping demand for derivatives, which also played a pivotal role in maintaining price trends.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Title: This 14.3% Dividend Could Double In Trump 2.0

PHOENIX, ARIZONA - DECEMBER 22: U.S. President-elect Donald Trump smiles during Turning Point USA's ... [+] AmericaFest at the Phoenix Convention Center on December 22, 2024 in Phoenix, Arizona. The annual four day conference geared toward energizing and connecting conservative youth hosts some of the country's leading conservative politicians and activists. (Photo by Rebecca Noble/Getty Images) Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) is an intriguing everything-proof stock for Trump 2.0. The company specializes in cutting-edge surgical devices and regardless of what the Fed or President-Elect Trump does in 2025, we know that Americans will continue to have surgeries. Human surgeons are expensive and prone to mistakes, so the big trend in the surgery room is towards robotics. Intuitive created the da Vinci system, the most widely used surgical robot in the world. Business is booming. The company anticipates 12% to 16% year-over-year demand growth for da Vinci. Its technology is less invasive and more precise than humans, which leads to faster recovery times for patients. The company just launched da Vinci 5, which has already been used in over 12,000 procedures. ISRG shareholders had a field day during Trump 1.0. The stock returned 179%. Why wouldn’t history repeat, or at least rhyme, and reward investors with another double or better? The bummer for us dividend investors is that Intuitive doesn’t pay one. Now, we could manufacture a payout by buying the stock and selling covered calls. But that is a pain. Today, call options with strike prices just above ISRG’s current price fetch a $10+/share premium. They expire later this month. So we could buy the stock, sell (“write”) those covered calls, and pocket the 2% premium. Then, we rinse and repeat in February. And March. And so on. We know this strategy. But it is a grind. Why not outsource it to, say, a fund manager? Rather than spending the rest of our lives writing covered calls, we are going to explore a “backdoor” payout play on ISRG. It nets us a 14.3% yearly dividend, paid monthly. Better yet, there are no monthly check-ins from our side. We buy the fund once and manager Dr. Erin Xie and her team do the rest of the work. All we do is buy the closed-end fund (CEF) BlackRock Health Sciences Trust (BMEZ). ISRG is Dr. Xie’s top holding at 4.6% of the portfolio. What a pick! The doctor’s fund BMEZ must be rallying in anticipation of Trump 2.0, right? Wrong! On the contrary, the fund sits in the bargain bin, believe it or not. BMEZ trades at a 9% discount to the value of its assets. In other words, we are able to snag this high-yield bounty for just 91 cents on the dollar. We’re “up” 9% without breaking a sweat. Why the sweet dividend deal? On the campaign trail, Trump said he was going to let former candidate turned supporter Robert F. Kennedy Jr. “go wild on health.” A big “uh oh” for healthcare stocks? The Wall Street suits didn’t wait around to find out. They have dumped anything and everything healthcare since the election and especially since RFK was nominated to run the Department of Health and Human Services. Big pharma has especially been a hot potato because Trump also said of RFK at a rally: “I’m going to let him go wild on medicines.” But Intuitive is not a medicine peddler. It is a surgical robotics innovator. Emotional investors will throw out an entire sector willy-nilly. So, the BMEZ selloff makes exactly zero sense. The same logic extends to BMEZ’s top five holdings. Check out how they performed as a group during Trump 1.0! BMEZ Top Holdings These are all companies that benefit from less regulation. They returned 126%, 141%, 179%, 227% and over 1,000% during the first four years under Trump! BMEZ is a neat way for us income investors to buy the basket, plus some. Dr. Xie’s team sells covered calls on its holdings to generate additional cash. Better BlackRock than us! We don’t need the monthly options headache. Nor the long separate tax bill! The covered call income powers the big payout. Plus, we have price upside via a potential “rhyme” of Trump 1.0 for stock holdings like Intuitive. The healthcare sector-at-large is cheap and BMEZ is a straight-up bargain at just 91 cents on the dollar. Not only that, but also investors just received a modest dividend raise. BMEZ dished a $0.17809 dividend in December, raising the fund’s yield to 14.3%. Again, that is paid monthly. (The raise was part of BlackRock’s managed distribution play for the fund, which targets an annualized 12% payout—mission accomplished, BR.)
