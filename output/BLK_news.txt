Bitcoin (BTC), alongside PEPETO, has become extremely active, leading to future growth in the cryptocurrency market. With large market events and technological advancements, these tokens are becoming popular. PEPETO is emerging as a game-changing meme coin, addressing the shortcomings of earlier tokens like Pepe. Built on principles of technology and optimization, #PEPETO aims to provide sustainable value and long-term growth for its community. Bitcoin has lost 5.68% over the past 24 hours, with a current price of $99,188.05. BTC continues to show liquidity and interest, with a trading volume of $82.4 billion. Most importantly, the limited supply of 21 million Bitcoin tokens guaranteed scarcity, underpinning Bitcoin’s value. MicroStrategy and BlackRock are institutions betting on Bitcoin, showing its ubiquity. If regulatory policies improve under Gensler’s impending exit from the SEC, it could lure in more institutional capital. As such, BTC remains a core asset for those looking for a holding period of long-term value. PEPETO’s total supply of 420 trillion tokens ensures accessibility while maintaining scarcity. The presale phase includes listings on five major exchanges, boosting visibility and liquidity. Additionally, staking rewards of 32 million #PEPETO tokens per ETH block will be distributed over two years. Pepeto is a cutting-edge cryptocurrency project blending the playful spirit of meme coins with a powerful utility-driven ecosystem. It features a zero-fee exchange, a cross-chain bridge for seamless swaps, and staking rewards designed to support the next generation of tokens.

Title: Saudi Allows Foreign Investment in Holy Cities - What it Means For Tourism

Subscribe today to keep up with the latest travel industry news. Select a question above or ask something else Saudi Arabia has opened its holy cities, Makkah and Madinah, to foreign investment in real estate, aiming to enhance tourism development. The move aligns with Vision 2030's goal to diversify the economy beyond oil, with religious tourism being a significant economic contributor, generating $28.3 billion in 2023. Major projects like Masar Destination and Rua Al Madinah aim to transform urban areas and increase pilgrim capacity by 2030. Saudi Arabia has opened up foreign investment into real estate firms in its holy cities this week, a move that will support development in the kingdom's most lucrative tourism destinations. Listed companies that own real estate in Makkah and Madinah can now receive investment from non-Saudis. The Saudi market regulator Capital Market Authority said in a statement: "Through this announcement, the Capital Market Authority (CMA) aims to stimulate investment, enhance the attractiveness and efficiency of the capital market, and strengthen its regional and international competitiveness while supporting the local economy." "This includes attracting foreign capital and providing the necessary liquidity for current and future projects in Makkah and Madinah through the investment products available in the Saudi market, positioning it as a key funding source for these distinctive developmental projects." The Ministry of Hajj and Umrah did not immediately respond to requests for comment on how the change could impact tourism. The CMA said that the foreign investment would be limited to shares, convertible debt instruments, or both, and would exclude "strategic foreign investors." It added that people without Saudi nationality would not be allowed to own more than 49% of shares of the firms involved. FDI, or foreign direct investment, is a hot topic in Saudi Arabia, especially regarding tourism projects. Multi-billion-dollar projects like Neom, Diriyah and Red Sea draw attention for the immense amount of public spending they have required. However, these projects are largely focused on the leisure market – religious tourism is the largest travel segment in Saudi by a wide margin. In 2023, religious tourism generated $28.3 billion in spending in Saudi and accounted for 11 of the 27 million international tourists that year, according to the Ministry of Tourism. Almost twice as many international travelers visited Saudi for religious purposes compared to leisure purposes in 2023. Tourism minister Ahmed Al-Khateeb affirmed at Davos this month that religious tourism is still the country's biggest driver. “Makkah and Madinah still top the list of the most visited destinations in Saudi Arabia, and attract millions of pilgrims annually, due to their religious importance.” The annual pilgrimage plays a vital role in the country's economy and upping the number of pilgrims is an integral part of its Vision 2030 economic reform agenda that aims to wean the economy off oil revenues. The two holy cities have their own set of projects, which can now be accelerated with foreign investment. Moreover, religious tourism is already a proven concept in Saudi, whereas leisure travel is still in its infancy, permitted only since 2019. Makkah: Madinah: Last April, BlackRock said it would be getting as much as $5 billion from Saudi's Public Investment Fund to invest in the region and build a Riyadh-based investment team. That same month, Saudi flew dozens of bankers to Neom – Saudi's biggest project – to explore “collaborative avenues,” according to Neom’s then-CEO Nadhmi Al-Nasr in a statement. The event drew representatives from 24 international banks and financial institutions, including those from Europe and the U.S. and in the region. Media reports have said parts of Neom, including The Line, has been scaling back. But according to Diriyah group CEO Jerry Inzerillo in a previous interview with Skift, that could merely reflect shifting priorities to other Saudi projects. "See, everybody is focused on what they think Neom is struggling with. Here’s how to look at it: There was a lot of money originally committed to Neom, but that money didn’t take into consideration the Kingdom would win the bid for the 2029 Winter Games in Trojena. So now, with the whole world going there to see the Winter Games, you need to put a lot of money into building Trojena." "Trojena could’ve been built after The Line, but now it’s before The Line. You need Trojena for 2029. A lot of it isn’t austerity, quite the opposite. It’s redirecting where the money goes."

Title: Crypto for Advisors: Crypto Ownership vs. ETF
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/coindesk-indices/2025/01/29/crypto-for-advisors-crypto-ownership-vs-etf
Time Published: 2025-01-30T16:00:00Z

In today’s issue, Miguel Kudry from L1 Advisors breaks down direct ownership of cryptocurrency vs. exchange-traded and wrapped funds and how they are expected to evolve through 2025. Then, Crews Enochs from Index Coop answers questions on the topic in Ask and Expert. – Sarah Morton You’re reading Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter that unpacks digital assets for financial advisors. Subscribe here to get it every Thursday. The year 2024 marked a pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency market with the launch of bitcoin and ether spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs), rapidly becoming some of the fastest-growing ETFs in history. According to various reports, global crypto ETPs amassed over $134 billion in assets under management (AUM) by November 2024. This success was notable even under the initial constraint of cash-only redemptions and contributions in the United States, a condition imposed by the SEC during the 2024 approvals. However, the landscape is set to evolve further in 2025 with anticipated changes in redemption mechanisms. The Shift to In-Kind Redemptions The SEC's decision in 2024 to not allow in-kind redemptions and contributions meant that only cash could be used for buying or selling ETF shares, which somewhat limited the potential of these financial products. This restriction is poised to change in 2025, with expectations that regulatory bodies will permit in-kind transactions for spot crypto ETFs. BlackRock has already filed for a rule change to enable in-kind redemptions for its Bitcoin ETF. This change will allow authorized participants to issue and redeem shares directly with Bitcoin or ether rather than cash, which will create a new liquidity flywheel between traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystems. Impact on Investors The cash-only approach previously left billions in cryptocurrency assets on the sidelines. Crypto-native investors, particularly those with low-basis assets, hesitated to convert their holdings into ETFs due to the substantial tax liabilities. With in-kind redemptions, these investors could move portions of their crypto wealth into ETFs without the immediate tax burden, thus accessing a broader range of traditional financial services like uncollateralized lending, mortgages, and private banking. For traditional investors who have gained exposure to cryptocurrencies through ETFs, the shift to in-kind redemptions provides an opportunity to dive deeper into the crypto ecosystem. These investors, having seen significant appreciation in their ETF holdings (bitcoin, for instance, was valued at around $46,800 at the time of ETF launch in January 2024, and ether at approximately $3,422 by mid-July 2024), can now convert their ETF shares into direct crypto holdings to explore DeFi products without needing new capital or facing tax implications. Catalysts for Change The recent withdrawal of Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 21 (SAB-21) is another significant development. This will relieve financial institutions from recording digital assets as liabilities on their balance sheets, encouraging more banks and brokerages to engage with crypto custody and develop crypto-native financial products. An example of this trend is Coinbase's recent launch of a bitcoin-backed lending product in partnership with Morpho Labs, leveraging DeFi to back loans with Bitcoin. This year, we should expect to see a wave of traditional financial institutions following this path. Concurrently, a segment of investors gravitate towards self-custody, preferring to manage their assets independently to access crypto-native products without intermediaries. This trend underscores the importance of user-friendly and secure self-custody solutions in the evolving crypto landscape. The Convergence of TradFi and DeFi 2025 is shaping up to be when the boundaries between traditional and decentralized finance become increasingly blurred. With mechanisms like in-kind transactions and favorable regulatory changes, investors will likely interact with crypto-native platforms more seamlessly, often inadvertently. This convergence is expected to enhance inflows into both sectors, boosting volume and creating a more interconnected and liquid market. In conclusion, the evolution from ETF to direct ownership in the crypto space is not just about investment choice but about how these financial instruments are reshaping investor behavior and market dynamics. With in-kind redemptions on the horizon and regulatory changes like the withdrawal of SAB-21, 2025 will mark a significant chapter in integrating cryptocurrencies into mainstream finance, further blurring the lines between traditional and on-chain financial rails. - Miguel Kudry, CEO, L1 Advisors Q. What sets on-chain crypto ownership apart from traditional ETFs? 24/7 market access is just the starting point. On-chain ownership unlocks true composability—allowing investors to use assets as collateral, earn yield, and participate in decentralized ecosystems. While ETFs provide exposure, on-chain assets provide unmatched flexibility and utility. Q. How does direct custody of crypto assets enhance investor flexibility compared to ETFs? Have you ever tried transferring holdings from one brokerage to another? How long did it take? Was it a nightmare of friction? Probably. With on-chain crypto ownership, you have complete control. You can self-custody your assets, deposit them with custodians, and move them in and out in minutes. What if an opportunity arises, and you need to act fast? You can get liquidity immediately by selling or borrowing against your assets—no waiting, no hassle, just action when needed. Q. Will the AI agents of the future prefer ETFs or tokenized assets on-chain? Imagine an AI agent managing investments. To buy an ETF, it would need to navigate KYC processes, work through a brokerage’s limited hours, and depend on human intermediaries. Tokenized assets on-chain eliminate these barriers, offering 24/7 access, seamless automation, and the composability to maximize efficiency. For AI-driven financial systems, the choice will be clear: DeFi. - Crews Enochs, ecosystem growth lead, Index Coop Note: The views expressed in this column are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CoinDesk, Inc. or its owners and affiliates.

Title: Apollo Unveils Tokenized Private Credit Fund With Securitize as Blockchain Deepens Links to Traditional Finance

Apollo, an investment firm with over $730 billion in assets under management, is offering investors a new tokenized private credit fund with the help of security token specialist Securitize. Accessed via the Apollo Diversified Credit Securitize Fund (ACRED) feeder fund, the token is the first public on-chain offering for accredited investors of Apollo and also the first integration for Securitize with the Solana blockchain, as well as with Ink, a layer-2 network built by the Kraken crypto exchange. Ethereum, Aptos, Avalanche and Polygon are also initial launchpads for the tokenized fund. Apollo Diversified Credit Fund, which has more than $1.2 billion in managed assets, invests in corporate direct lending, asset-backed finance as well as performing, dislocated and structured credit, the firm said. The fund delivered an 11.7% return in 2024 compared with around 4.5% on U.S. Treasuries. Christine Moy, a partner leading digital assets, data and AI strategy at Apollo, said the fund was chosen because it has a daily subscription and daily net asset value (NAV) structure that’s well suited for seamless and efficient blockchain-based markets. “For those that are trying to build a diversified portfolio on-chain, it serves as a higher yielding complement to stablecoins, tokenized treasuries and money market funds,” Moy said in an interview. “But it’s also a diversifier to the more volatile crypto native yield products that are out there. So it can help complete the picture of the different assets you would need in an on-chain diversified portfolio.” There’s been something of a rush among traditional finance firms to tokenize so-called real world assets (RWAs), with blockchain-based versions of U.S. Treasuries being the largest and most liquid market to emerge. As of 2023, global private credit assets under management reached approximately $2.1 trillion, a fourfold increase from a decade earlier, according to Securitize. Private credit tokens are less common, but they open up a new space for on-chain assets, said Securitize CEO Carlos Domingo. “Private credit is an area that’s been exploding of late, and we have been among the pioneers in this area of tokenization having already launched a top-tier private credit fund token with Hamilton Lane,” Domingo said in an interview. “Private credit with a higher yield is a good complement to treasuries especially in a scenario with interest rates coming down.” Securitize is the tokenization partner of BlackRock and the digital transfer agent for the asset manager’s BUIDL money market fund token. For Apollo, Securitize is using its partnership with Wormhole, a developer platform that allows different blockchain networks to communicate with each other, to offer a multichain approach out of the gate. Apollo has participated in some tests of tokenized assets such as a proof of concept last year involving JPMorgan, carried out under the auspices of Project Guardian, a collaborative effort led by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). Moy, a longtime Web3 strategist who previously worked on JPMorgan’s blockchain and led projects like Intraday Repo, looked ahead to working in areas like decentralized finance (DeFi). “Tokenizing Apollo’s products is just the beginning,” Moy said. “We're excited to collaborate with leading teams in the digital assets ecosystem to design modern treasury management, automatically rebalancing investment portfolios at scale, smart contract-driven collateral management, and in the future, potentially the enablement of secondary liquidity for alternative assets.” Ian Allison is a senior reporter at CoinDesk, focused on institutional and enterprise adoption of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology.

The bitcoin price dropped sharply toward $100,000 before bouncing back to around $102,000 though bitcoin and crypto remain subdued despite BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink revealing a sovereign wealth fund bombshell. Now, as Coinbase's chief executive predicts when the bitcoin price could flip gold's $18 trillion, bitcoin and crypto traders are braced for the Federal Reserve's latest interest rate decision after U.S. president Donald Trump called for rates to come down sharply. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run U.S. president Donald Trump has called for Federal Reserve chair to lower interest rates by "a ... [+] lot"—something that many think would boost the bitcoin price and crypto market. The market is pricing in a near-100% certainty that the Fed's rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will keep interest rates on hold, according to the CME Group FedWatch Tool, after cutting rates at each of its last three meetings. "The current [bitcoin price] lull can be attributed to risk aversion ahead of the Fed meeting," Alex Kuptsikevich, the FxPro chief market analyst, said in an emailed note. 01/30 update: The bitcoin price and wider crypto market have climbed after the Federal Reserve followed through with its well-telegraphed pause of interest rate cuts yesterday, with the bitcoin price topping $105,000. Fed chair Jerome Powell's dovish comments that indicated he expects inflation to continue to ease helped push bitcoin and crypto prices higher. "Even with the U.S. Federal Reserve pursuing a ‘wait and see’ strategy on further interest rate cuts, bitcoin bulls have little reason to worry," Neil Roarty, cryptocurrency analyst at ClickOut Media, said in emailed comments. "The current 4.25% to 4.5% range is already proving low enough to sustain risk appetite, even if inflation is still higher than the Fed’s target. Bitcoin looks safe above the $100,000 watermark, and it could break higher over the coming months if Donald Trump pressures Jerome Powell into accelerating cuts, as he’s hinted he may. While bitcoin remains an attractive risk-on asset at current rates, a drop below 3% could flood markets with liquidity, further fueling speculation and pushing bitcoin into uncharted territory." Powell also opened the door for banks to start serving crypto companies, provided they take proper precautions. "Banks are perfectly able to serve crypto customers as long as they can understand and service the risks," Powell said at a press conference following the Fed's rate decision. Meanwhile, U.S. president Donald Trump criticized the Fed and Powell, accusing them of failing to get a handle on inflation and the economy and putting pressure on Powell to bring interest rates down through 2025. "Because Jay Powell and the Fed failed to stop the problem they created with inflation, I will do it by unleashing American energy production, slashing regulation, rebalancing international trade, and reigniting American manufacturing, but I will do much more than stopping inflation, I will make our country financially, and otherwise, powerful again," Trump posted to his Truth Social account. "The Fed has done a terrible job on bank regulation. Treasury is going to lead the effort to cut unnecessary regulation, and will unleash lending for all American people and businesses. If the Fed had spent less time on DEI, gender ideology, 'green' energy, and fake climate change, inflation would never have been a problem. Instead, we suffered from the worst inflation in the history of our country." The rate decision will be released Wednesday at 2pm ET, followed by the all-important press conference led by Fed chair Jerome Powell in which reporters will press him for a reaction to Trump's comments that interest rates should come down by "a lot." "I think I know interest rates much better than they do, and I think I know them certainly much better than the one who’s primarily in charge of making that decision," Trump said last week. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has surged over the last year, helped by the Federal Reserve beginning its ... [+] interest rate cutting cycle. Last year, then-Republican candidate Trump said U.S. presidents should have a say over decisions made by the Fed, raising the possibility it could lose its independence. "We expect [Fed chair Powell] to be as diplomatic as is possible, while firmly committing to Fed independence," Ajay Rajadhyaksha, an economist at Barclays, wrote in a note seen by Axios. "Now that Trump has been calling quite vocally for lower interest rates, if the Fed eases monetary policy it will create the impression that they caved to him and forfeited their independence," Isabella Weber, economist at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, told the Financial Times.

Title: Crypto Banking Gets Green Light From Fed Chair Jerome Powell
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-banking-green-light-fed-chair-powell/
Time Published: 2025-01-30T12:00:28Z
Full Content:
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell delivered remarks yesterday suggesting that US banks can freely engage with crypto clients—provided they understand and manage the inherent risks. Powell’s comments came during the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) press conference, where he addressed queries about the Fed’s stance on crypto banking. “Banks are perfectly able to serve crypto customers as long as they understand and can manage the risks,” Powell said. “We’re not against innovation, and we certainly don’t want to take actions that would cause banks to terminate customers who are perfectly legal just because excess risk aversion may be related to regulation and supervision.” Within hours, key figures in the community offered widespread praise for Powell’s statement, interpreting it as a green light for banks that have been hesitant to embrace crypto services. Nic Carter, a partner at Castle Island Ventures and co-founder of blockchain data aggregator Coinmetrics.io, commented via X, “Immense tonal shift. OCP2.0 over. this is particularly notable because my understanding is the Fed specifically was the nexus of OCP2.0.” This sentiment was echoed by Hunter Horsley, CEO of Bitwise Asset Management, who tweeted, “Banks will be a major catalyst for crypto in 2025. Mainstream era beginning.” Meanwhile, David Lawant, head of research at FalconX, remarked, “Massive wave incoming over next 6-18 months. Most aren’t aware of the scale of it.” Joe Consorti, head of growth at They, underscored the potential breadth of bank offerings: “Banks can custody bitcoin on behalf of clients, create structured bitcoin financial products, and allow customers to buy bitcoin. Even Powell isn’t badmouthing it anymore. Vibe shift.” Bitcoin analyst Dylan LeClair also signaled the convergence of regulatory and market forces, stating, “FASB + repeal of SAB 121 + In-Kind redemptions for ETFs. Banks are here.” Powell’s comments arrive at a moment when several regulatory and accounting changes are poised to reshape how banks handle digital assets. In August 2024, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) introduced a standardized framework for accounting cryptocurrencies on company balance sheets. This was a landmark step, as it establishes clarity on reporting practices—a crucial component for banks considering offering crypto services. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had previously imposed Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 121 in March 2022, requiring financial firms to record customer-held cryptocurrencies as liabilities on their balance sheets. On January 23, 2025, the SEC repealed this rule through SAB 122. This move simplifies the custody process for digital assets, removing a substantial reporting burden and paving the way for more financial institutions to engage in crypto. Moreover, in-kind redemptions for exchange-traded funds (ETFs), especially Bitcoin ETFs, are set to become a reality under the Trump administration. Instead of using cash, this mechanism allows ETF shares to be exchanged for the underlying assets—aligning smoothly with Bitcoin’s decentralized nature and offering potential tax benefits. BlackRock recently applied for a rule change at the SEC for its spot Bitcoin ETF. Taken together, these regulatory evolutions—coupled with Powell’s supportive tone—signal a turning point for banks considering entry into crypto markets. Industry observers suggest that, with obstacles like SAB 121 removed and transparent FASB rules in place, US banks could become leading participants in the next wave of crypto adoption. At press time, the total crypto market cap stood at $3.49 trillion. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email. Jake Simmons has been a Bitcoin enthusiast since 2016.

Title: Czech Central Bank Governor To Propose Stunning $7 Billion Bitcoin Reserve Plan

Czech National Bank (CNB) Governor Aleš Michl said in a recent interview that he is set to present a Bitcoin investment plan to the board on Thursday, which, if approved, could see the apex bank potentially acquire $7 billion in BTC as part of its diversification strategy. This would make CNB the first central bank to hold the premier crypto. Speaking with Financial Times (FT), Czech central bank chief Aleš Michl revealed that he wants to add billions of dollars worth of the country’s reserves into Bitcoin. Michl will submit a plan to allocate as much as 5% of its €140 billion (or $146 billion) of the bank’s reserves to BTC. For perspective, such a Bitcoin buy would be equivalent to around 5.3 months of newly minted BTC, as noted by André Dragosch, head of research at Bitwise. Michl acknowledged Bitcoin’s significant volatility and limited track record but noted increased investor appetite since BlackRock and other investment managers listed spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and President Donald Trump’s campaign promises on crypto deregulation, and the establishment of a national BTC stockpile. “For the diversification of our assets, Bitcoin seems good,” Michl told FT, adding that he had a different stance than other central bankers in matters of crypto. “Of course, if you compare my position with other bankers, then I’m the one entering the jungle or the pioneer. I used to run an investment fund, so I’m a typical investment banker I would say, I like profitability.” President Trump’s return to the White House has bolstered optimism in the crypto industry due to heightened expectations of a more lenient regulatory environment for digital assets. Michl believes Trump’s crypto-friendly stance will potentially light a fire under the bulls, setting up the crypto for a break to new sky-high levels. “Those [Trump] guys can now kind of create some bubble for Bitcoin, but I think the trend would be an increase without those guys as well because it’s an alternative [investment] for more people.” The CNB governor further suggested that more central banks around the world could follow his example in the coming five years, but he also cautioned that the investment could end up being worthless. “It’s possible to have a big range of outcomes, that Bitcoin will have a value of zero or an absolutely fantastic value.” The world’s largest crypto briefly hit a record $108,786 just before President Trump’s inauguration on Jan. 20 but has since retraced to $105,251 as of publication time.

Title: MicroStrategy Isn’t Just A Giant Bitcoin Bet–It’s A Revolution In Corporate Finance

New Year’s Eve at Villa Vecchia is a delirious blur of orange and gold, a scene straight out of F. Scott Fitzgerald’s most opulent fantasies. More than 500 people crowd onto the manicured lawns of the century-old Miami Beach estate with its Versailles-inspired ballroom that once welcomed luminaries including Margaret Thatcher, Henry Kissinger and Mikhail Gorbachev. Bitcoin’s recent surge past $100,000—not the dawn of 2025—is the real raison d’être for the bash. Servers glide around with champagne on silver trays, hors d’oeuvres are stamped with the omnipresent B and dancers in golden bodysuits undulate with glowing orange orbs in homage to bitcoin’s signature hue. At the center of the garden looms a massive playing card, the king’s face replaced with a brazen B. jamel toppin for forbes On the water, the party continues aboard the Usher. The 154-foot superyacht, which was featured in the 2015 film Entourage, glistens against the Miami skyline. A constant stream of shuttles disgorges an unending parade of bitcoin executives, influencers and, most importantly, institutional investors, all decked out in “bitcoin chic” (tangerine suits, B-logo bling). Two giant projectors flash clips forecasting bitcoin’s rise into the millions, while a DJ clad in a space helmet directs bass-heavy tracks between the swaying palms. “I kind of feel a little sick of winning,” quips one reveler in a black cap emblazoned with SATOSHI NAKAMOTO—the handle of bitcoin’s anonymous creator. The partygoers all have crypto cred: The guy in the Nakamoto hat is David Bailey, the 34-year old CEO of BTC Inc., publisher of Bitcoin Magazine, who hosted the Bitcoin Conference in July at which Donald Trump vowed to make America the “crypto capital of the planet” and establish a national bitcoin stockpile. Villa Vecchia’s owner and host, Michael Saylor, 59, moves through the revelry clad in his signature black blazer, blue jeans and T-shirt whose front sports (of course) a B. He graciously accepts handshakes and requests for selfies. Here, bitcoin is God—and Saylor is its prophet. Crypto is a second coming of sorts for Saylor, given that he made and lost more than $10 billion during the original dot-com bubble. Back then, MicroStrategy, the Tysons Corner, Virginia–based software firm he cofounded in 1989 fresh out of MIT, was in the data mining and business intelligence software business before running afoul of the Securities and Exchange Commission over its accounting practices. In 2000, the company paid a fine, settled with the feds and restated its results for the preceding couple years. Forbes For the next two decades MicroStrategy languished with tepid sales and a market cap hovering around $1 billion. That all changed in 2020, when Saylor decided that going all in on bitcoin would be MicroStrategy’s core strategy. Last year, after the SEC approved bitcoin ETFs from giants like BlackRock and Fidelity, the crypto­currency’s price skyrocketed, more than doubling over 12 months and breaking through $100,000 in early December. Just before Christmas, Micro­Strategy joined the Nasdaq 100, spurring even more demand for its stock, which is up more than 700% in the last year, as it issued debt and accumulated more bitcoin (it now owns 471,107). Saylor’s company is now the largest holder of the digital asset outside of the elusive Nakamoto, who is said to hold 1 million tokens. During 2024, Saylor’s net worth jumped from $1.9 billion to $7.6 billion. A month into the new year he is worth $9.4 billion. MicroStrategy’s eye-popping gains have stirred up a swarm of critics and short sellers unable to fathom how a tiny software company holding only $48 billion in actual bitcoin could have a market capitalization of $84 billion. But what Saylor’s detractors fail to understand is that Micro­Strategy is brilliantly straddling two realms: one bound by the rules of traditional finance, in which companies issue debt and equity bought and sold by hedge funds, traders and other institutions, and the second governed by the faithful, unwavering believers in a better world brought to you by bitcoin. The fuel propelling MicroStrategy’s success is its embrace and cultivation of volatility, the defining characteristic of its core asset. Volatility is anathema to traditional investors, but it’s a great friend of the options traders, hedge funds and retail speculators that have helped make Micro­Strategy among the most active stocks in the market. With its relatively tiny annual revenue of $496 million, it has a daily trading volume that rivals that of any of the Magnificent 7 tech giants (Meta, Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, Tesla and Nvidia). “People think that’s crazy,” Saylor says. “How can such a small company have that liquidity? It’s because we put a crypto reactor in the middle of the company, pull capital in and then we spin it. That puts volatility in the equity, and that makes our options and convertible bonds the most interesting and highest-performing in the market.” Michael Saylor is 100 percent correct when it comes to the desirability of the $7.3 billion in convertible bonds his company has issued since 2021. Every minute of the trading day, MicroStrategy’s stock price is being amplified in real time by bitcoin’s constant gyrations, increasing what’s known as the implied volatility of the call option inherent in its convertible bonds. That’s because unlike straight bonds, convertibles give debt holders safety, with the option of exchanging their notes for Micro­Strategy stock at predetermined prices until maturity. Every trader schooled in the Black-Scholes options pricing formula knows that high implied volatility increases the value of an option. Thus Saylor has been able to issue his convertible debt at almost no interest cost. So far MicroStrategy’s six convertible notes, issued with maturities from 2027 to 2032, have interest rates ranging from 0% to 2.25%. In public bond markets, where liquidity has been shrinking thanks to the boom in private credit, institutional investors are starving for excess returns. MicroStrategy’s bonds not only represent one of the only ways big investors like German insurer Allianz and State Street can invest in digital assets, but they’ve also been one of the market’s top performers, clocking returns in excess of 250% since issuance. Even the $3 billion five-year notes MicroStrategy issued in November, with their 0% coupon and strike price of $672 (80% above MicroStrategy’s current share price) are up 89% in just a few months. Saylor understands that institutional investors, who are measured against quarterly benchmarks, will keep buying his high-octane paper to boost their portfolio returns. Issuing huge amounts of convertible bonds, as MicroStrategy has, is normally dilutive for a company’s stock, but in this case it has had a bullish effect because the notes represent future stock demand at increasingly higher prices. Through secondary offerings and convertible issuance, MicroStrategy’s outstanding shares have grown since 2020 from 97 million to 246 million. Over the same period, its stock has appreciated 2,666%. In late January, its shareholders voted to vastly increase the company’s authorized shares to 10.3 billion. The cycle feeds itself: Issue billions in low- or no-cost debt and equity, drive bitcoin pri­ces higher with large purchases and catapult MicroStrategy’s hyper­volatile stock. Rinse and repeat. “What they found is a monetary glitch in the financial markets that they’re taking advantage of,” marvels Richard Byworth, former conver­tible bonds trader at Nomura and managing partner at Zurich, Switzerland–based alternative investment firm Syz Capital. Saylor is understandably unabashed in his hyping of bitcoin. Last August he invented an entirely new financial metric dubbed Bitcoin Yield or BTC Yield. This sort of “yield” has nothing to do with any income being generated but simply measures the percentage change in the ratio of the company’s bitcoin holdings to the company’s fully diluted shares over time. His initial targets for the measure were 4% to 8% growth annually, but in January MicroStrategy reported a BTC Yield of 48% for Q4 and 74.3% for all of 2024—big but meaningless numbers he has fed like chum to his adoring followers. Try to put a value on MicroStrategy the old-fashioned way and you’ll lose your marbles, according to Ben Werkman, a former commercial banker, consultant and early investor in the company’s bitcoin strategy. Saylor “turned off the income statement thinking and said ‘We’re going to attack the net worth side of the company, focus on leveraging the strength that we have on our balance sheet,’ and in this case, that means acquiring more bitcoin.” Which is exactly what MicroStrategy is doing. In October, Saylor unveiled a plan called “21/21” to raise a whopping $42 billion—half through equity, half through debt—over the next three years to buy more bitcoin. In November and December alone, the firm scooped up nearly 200,000 coins worth roughly $18 billion. It all works out brilliantly as long as the price of bitcoin keeps rising, but what if it collapses, as it has many times before? “Size is everything because liquidity is everything. MicroStrategy is singularly the most liquid source to trade bitcoin-related risks, both by the spot market and, more importantly, the options market.” Unless it’s a true apocalypse, MicroStrategy should be okay. Bitcoin would need to fall by more than 80% from its current $100,000-plus level and stay that way for at least two years for Micro­Strategy to fall short on its ability to cover its current debt obligations. Here again Saylor has shown genius in exploiting the capital markets and the behavior of bond investors. All of the $7 billion in debt MicroStrategy has issued is unsecured and not technically backed by any of the bitcoin in its coffers. Moreover, at the company’s current stock price of $373, more than $4 billion of its debt is already “in the money” or, effectively, equity. “Actually, there is very little debt on Micro­Strategy’s balance sheet,” says Jeff Park, head of alpha strategies at Bitwise, a San Francisco–based crypto asset manager, noting that a forced liquidation of MicroStrategy’s bitcoin holdings would be unlikely because institutional bondholders have high tolerance for refinancings, even in worst-case bankruptcy scenarios. What is stopping other companies from copying Saylor’s bitcoin-fueled financial engineering? Nothing. And many are starting to do exactly that. According to Park, Bitwise counts about 90 public companies, including well-known names Tesla and Block, that have added bitcoin to their balance sheets. In March, his company will launch the Bitwise Bitcoin Standard Corporations ETF, which will be a bitcoin holdings-weighted index of 35 public companies in possession of at least 1,000 bitcoin (roughly $100 million) in their treasuries. MicroStrategy will domi­nate the index. The copycats are giving ammunition to Micro­Strategy haters. “The days when MicroStrategy shares represented a rare, unique way to gain access to bitcoin are long over,” according to Kerrisdale Capital, a Miami-based investment firm that issued a short thesis on the stock in March. But Park argues that like Netflix in streaming, Micro­Strategy’s first-mover advantage and size set it apart. “Size is everything because liquidity is everything. They are singularly the most liquid source to trade bitcoin-related risks, both by the spot market and, more importantly, the options market,” Park says. “The options market for Micro­Strategy is by far the deepest single name options market in the entire world.” MicroStrategy’s frenetic options have even spawned a fund called YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF, which sells call options to generate income. The year-old fund has an annual yield of 106% and has already amassed $1.9 billion in assets. Sitting by the pool at Villa Vecchia, with his crypto-named parrots Hodl, Satoshi and Max chattering away in the background, Saylor waves off his critics. “Conventional wisdom in business for the last 40 years was that capital is a liability and volatility is bad. The bitcoin standard dictates capital is an asset and volatility is good—it’s a feature,” he insists. “They’re living in flatland, a pre-Copernican world. We’re on a train going 60 miles an hour, spinning a gyro with a 30-ton weight on it, and the rest of the world is standing by the side of the track, stationary.” This isn’t the first time Michael Saylor has flown close to the sun. He was born in 1965 on an Air Force base in Lincoln, Nebraska, and his early years were steeped in military discipline. His father, a chief master sergeant, moved the family between Air Force bases around the world before settling near Wright-Patterson in Ohio—home of the Wright Brothers’ aviation school—where Saylor gradua­ted high school as valedictorian and class marshal, voted “most likely to succeed” by his peers. He went on to study aeronautics and astronautics at MIT on a full Air Force ROTC scholarship and wrote a thesis on a computer simulation of a Renaissance Italian city-state. In his free time, he played guitar in a rock band and flew gliders. He graduated in 1987 with highest honors and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Air Force, but his dream of becoming a fighter pilot was grounded by a heart murmur, which turned out to be a misdiagnosis. At age 24, he cofounded MicroStrategy with his MIT fraternity brother Sanju Bansal. The company tapped into data analytics at a time when few understood that discipline’s potential. Riding the dot-com wave, the company went public in 1998, and by 2000, its market cap soared past $24 billion. With his net worth rising to a peak of nearly $14 billion, Saylor became a tech evangelist heralding a world in which data would flow “like water.” “We’re going to use our technology to obliterate entire supply chains,” Saylor told Forbes in late 1998. “We’re playing for all the marbles to essentially win the entire industry worldwide, forever.” Then came the crash. On March 10, 2000, Micro­Strategy’s stock hit a peak of $313 per share—more than 60 times its IPO price. Within two weeks it plummeted to $72, following the company’s announcement that it would need to restate its financial results. The SEC accused Saylor and others of accounting fraud, charges MicroStrategy later settled for $11 million. Within two years its stock price had fallen below $1. Saylor’s $13 billion fortune evaporated. “It was the darkest part of my life,” he says. “When people lose money because they believe in you, that’s pretty much the worst.” In 2020, after the government followed years of quantitative easing with trillions of dollars in Covid-19-related stimulus, Saylor became convinced that the best use for the remaining $530 million in cash and short-term investments on MicroStrategy’s balance sheet was investing in bitcoin. The U.S. government could print as many dollars as it wanted—and it was hard at work doing just that—but, by design, bitcoin comes with a hard cap: There will never be more than 21 million in existence. If the price of bitcoin plummets, MicroStrategy’s stock will fall harder and faster than the token itself. But be careful about dismissing Saylor as yet another too-smart-for-his-own good entrepreneur gone off the rails. Many others are following the lead of MicroStrategy—which now bills itself “the world’s first and largest Bitcoin Treasury.” Some public companies, like Metaplanet, owe their very survival to bitcoin. The Tokyo-based hotel chain faced an existential crisis during the pandemic when Japan closed its borders to tourists. The small hotelier sold all but one of its ten properties and issued shares and debt to finance $70 million in bitcoin purchases. Metaplanet’s shares, which trade on the Tokyo Stock Exchange and over the counter, gained 2,600% in 2024, and its market capitalization is now $1 billion, despite holding only $183 million worth of bitcoin. The company’s homepage now reads “Secure the Future with Bitcoin” and barely mentions hotels. “We owe a lot to Michael Saylor for the business plan, which he has created for the rest of the world to follow,” says Simon Gerovich, CEO of Metaplanet and a guest at Saylor’s New Year’s bash. “I invented 20 things, tried to make them successful and really didn’t change the world with any of them. Satoshi created one thing, gave it to the world and disappeared. It’s made me more successful than every one of my ideas.” It is unlikely many corporations will go to Metaplanet’s extreme, but more bitcoin converts are almost a certainty. In January, the Financial Accounting Standards Board changed a rule that previously permitted companies to record crypto value declines only as losses in quarterly reports, so that now holdings will be marked to market, allowing for reversal of losses and gains as well. For MicroStrategy, which lobbied for the change, it’s likely to mean numerous profitable quarters ahead—and possible inclusion in the S&P 500. Today hundreds of sizable public companies around the world are sitting on more than twice the cash they need to finance current operations and liabilities, according to data from YCharts. Most prominent among them is Berkshire Hathaway, which currently holds $320 billion in cash. Given the $35 trillion (and growing) national debt, Saylor’s mantra has long been “cash is trash.” “Financial repression is an eternal phenomenon,” insists Bitwise’s Park, referring to the inevitability of government-induced lower interest rates. “We are living in this hyper-financialized world where the real economy has fundamentally detached itself from the financial economy. You actually can’t service the level of debt without printing more money, and if you believe you have to continue printing more money, then you better believe there’s going to be yield curve repression.” For Saylor, Villa Vecchia itself is Exhibit A. The 18,000-square-foot mansion on Miami’s “Millionaire’s Row” was built for the president of F.W. Woolworth in 1928; Saylor bought it for $13 million in 2012. This house “was $100,000 in 1930. It was appraised at $46 million a few years ago,” said Saylor during a 2023 podcast interview. “Do the calculation—it’s on a path to be worth $100 million, which means that the U.S. dollar will have lost 99.9% of its value over 100 years. The bottom line is: Your money in the bank isn’t money.” The coming Trump years are likely to be good for MicroStrategy and bitcoin. Despite all his bluster about “government efficiency,” Trump was a huge spendthrift during his first presidency: In the four years of Trump 1.0, the national debt increased by $8.4 trillion, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. And although he famously called bitcoin a “scam” competing against the dollar in 2021, Trump is all in on crypto these days. In fact, his son Eric recently posted a picture with Saylor at Mar-a-Lago captioned “Two friends, one passion: bitcoin.” Not only is the value of the dollar likely to further erode over the next four years, but Saylor’s relentless proselytizing aligns perfectly with the dystopian MAGA worldview. “The human condition has been plagued by dirt: toxic food, toxic liquid, and the economic condition of the human race has been plagued by toxic capital. I’m on a mission to evangelize nontoxic capital for the world,” he preaches. But even Michael Saylor occasionally steps down from his soapbox to reflect on his corporate journey. “We adopted bitcoin out of frustration and desperation, and then it became an opportunity, and then it became a strategy, and then it became an identity, and then it became a mission,” he says. “The irony of my career is I invented 20 things, and I tried to make them successful, and I really didn’t change the world with any of them. Satoshi created one thing, gave it to the world and disappeared, and now we just carry the torch. That, ironically, has made me more successful than me trying to commercialize every one of my own ideas. It is a lesson in humility.” And a reminder that lightning can indeed strike the same place twice, especially when there is a shrewd and opportunistic steward at the helm.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities Amid DeepSeek Selloff. In this article, we are going to take a look at where First American Financial Corporation (NYSE:FAF) stands against other non-tech AI opportunities amid DeepSeek selloff. Investors are searching for safer ways to capitalize on the AI boom beyond traditional tech stocks. Towards the back end of last year, Goldman Sachs highlighted sectors such as utilities, industrials, retail, and healthcare as key beneficiaries of AI-driven productivity gains and cost reductions. While companies like NVIDIA have surged in value due to their role in AI hardware, Goldman analysts suggest the market has yet to fully recognize the potential of downstream AI-exposed industries. David Kostin, Goldman’s chief US equity strategist, outlines four phases of the AI boom. The first phase revolves around NVIDIA and AI chipmakers, while the second phase focuses on AI infrastructure, including semiconductor, data center, networking, cloud, and security firms. These stocks have significantly outperformed market benchmarks in 2024. The third phase will involve companies integrating AI into their products to drive revenue growth. While these firms have lagged behind pure AI plays, their time is expected to come. The fourth phase includes businesses that will realize long-term productivity gains from AI adoption. Currently overlooked by the market, these companies are expected to see valuation expansions over time. The industrial sector exemplifies this trend. Since early 2023, industrial stocks have gained nearly 30%, with AI-exposed firms more than doubling in value. In Q4 2023, AI mentions in industrial earnings reports rose from 10% to over 30%. Goldman Sachs anticipates these trends will continue, with downstream AI stocks eventually rallying as their AI-driven efficiencies translate into earnings growth. Read more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and AI News You Should Not Have Missed. As the sudden popularity of Chinese AI startup DeepSeek ignites a tech selloff in the US stock market, investors are closely monitoring the non-tech AI opportunities that hold explosive growth potential. Earlier this month, Goldman Sachs released an investor note detailing some of the non-tech beneficiaries of the AI boom. Per the bank, the rise of AI-driven data centers was fueling a massive increase in electricity demand, with power needs expected to grow by over 160% by 2030. Nuclear energy is poised to play a critical role in meeting this demand, but it won’t be the sole solution. Natural gas, renewables, and battery storage will also be essential, according to Goldman Sachs Research. The report notes that big tech companies have already signed contracts for over 10 GW of potential new nuclear capacity in the US, with three nuclear plants possibly coming online by 2030. Globally, governments are becoming more supportive of nuclear power, with the COP28 summit setting a goal to triple global nuclear capacity by 2050. However, challenges such as labor shortages, permitting difficulties, and uranium supply constraints may slow progress, the report warned. Renewables will also be a major part of the energy mix, with 40% of new capacity expected to come from wind and solar. However, their intermittent nature means they must be paired with battery storage and baseload sources like nuclear or natural gas. Despite lower energy costs for renewables, transmission and storage limitations pose challenges.

For this article, we selected non-tech AI stocks by consulting an investor note from prominent investment firm Goldman Sachs. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

Title: No More Bitcoin Bear Markets Ever? Fund CIO Explores New Market Reality

In a new investor note published on January 29, 2025, Matt Hougan, Chief Investment Officer at Bitwise, questioned whether the historical four-year market cycle of Bitcoin could finally be coming to an end. His reasoning is rooted in seismic shifts in US policy toward crypto, highlighted by a recent executive order from President Trump aimed at solidifying the nation’s leadership in digital assets. Hougan’s note begins with an explanation of the so-called “four-year cycle,” where Bitcoin has typically seen three years of substantial gains followed by a pullback. This cycle, he explains, mirrors broader boom-bust patterns in traditional markets:“The four-year cycle in crypto is driven by the same forces that drive broader cycles of growth and recession in the general economy,” he wrote. These expansions, fueled by technological breakthroughs or increased investor interest, often lead to over-leverage, occasionally resulting in fraud or industry-wide strain. Eventually, something “breaks” and triggers a market correction—such as the 2014 Mt. Gox collapse or the 2018 SEC crackdown on ICOs. Hougan describes the current crypto upswing as the “Mainstream Cycle,” emerging out of 2022’s “massive deleveraging” caused by failures like FTX, Three Arrows Capital, and others. According to him, the latest bull phase took off in March 2023, when Grayscale convincingly “won the opening argument” in its legal challenge against the SEC over a spot Bitcoin ETF. “Bitcoin was trading at $22,218 when Grayscale mounted its argument. It’s trading at $102,674 today. The mainstream era has arrived.” Once a spot Bitcoin ETF was approved and launched in January 2024, investor inflows surged, further cementing Bitcoin’s acceptance among both retail and institutional players. The most striking component of Hougan’s analysis is his examination of last week’s executive order issued by President Trump. The order not only deemed the development of the US digital asset ecosystem a “national priority,” but it also set in motion a clearer regulatory framework for crypto. “Last week, President Trump issued an executive order that was so overwhelmingly bullish for the space that it’s making me wonder,” Hougan wrote, noting how the document outlines plans for a potential “national crypto stockpile” and encourages banks and financial institutions to accelerate their adoption of digital assets. Combined with a now more welcoming stance from the SEC, Hougan believes these measures could unleash trillions in new investment over the coming years, far surpassing the hundreds of billions that an ETF-driven market was already expected to generate. Hougan’s analysis acknowledges that Bitcoin has historically followed its pattern of eventual pullbacks after surging bull runs. But with Wall Street behemoths and major banks preparing to integrate crypto at every level, there’s a growing possibility that the market may not face the traditional plunge in 2026: “If it’s not until next year that we feel those impacts, will we really have a new ‘crypto winter’ in 2026?” he posited. “If BlackRock CEO Larry Fink is calling for $700k Bitcoin, are we really going to see a 70% pullback?” While he concedes that leverage continues to build in the system—citing an uptick in Bitcoin-backed lending programs, derivatives, and levered exchange-traded products—he also highlights an increasingly diverse pool of crypto investors. This diversity, he argues, could dampen severe drawdowns. “My guess is that we haven’t fully overcome the four-year cycle. Leverage will build up as the bull market builds. Excess will appear. Bad actors will emerge. And at some point, there could be a sharp pullback when the market gets over its skis,” Hougan argued. However, Hougan expects that any future market correction will be “shorter and shallower” than previous cycles. With the industry’s infrastructure now significantly more robust and mainstream participants treating crypto as a legitimate asset class, a dramatic bear market akin to those of 2014 or 2018 may be less likely. “As for now, it’s full steam ahead,” he concluded. “The crypto train is leaving the station.” At press time, BTC traded at $105,275.

Title: Elegant Victorian with showstopper potential on Donnybrook’s Marlborough Road for €1.95m

In their lifetime, many of the large Victorian properties on Marlborough Road in Donnybrook have transitioned from family homes to flats and back again. Number 102, which was built in 1856, falls somewhere in between. It has been owned by the same family for several years, and has been adapted over time for different life stages. While it is not set out in self-contained units per se, separate living spaces have been created inside the two-storey over-basement redbrick. With a floor area of 285sq m (3,067sq ft) and a total of six bedrooms, the Dublin 4 property is in good condition, with many original features intact and well-maintained. It is on the market through Mullery O’Gara with an asking price of €1.95 million. Marlborough Road is a long, tree-lined street in Dublin 4 with Morehampton Road at one end and Sandford Road at the other, effectively connecting Donnybrook and Ranelagh villages. Most homes along the road that were converted into flats in years gone by have now been returned to family homes. Taking number 102 back to a family home in its entirety would not require too much work. The house has not been carved out into individual flats, so new owners could move in following a little reconfiguring. The granite steps lead up to the main entrance, with the Victorian architecture evident from the minute you walk into the hallway. The ornate coving, detailed architraves and original stained-glass window have all been restored and showcased. [ Double-fronted Victorian home close to the sea in Clontarf for €2.495mOpens in new window ] To the left is the drawingroom, which has not lost any of its grandeur during the property’s many guises, with high ceilings, sash windows and the original granite fireplace remaining the standout features. Straight ahead is a study with a long sash window looking out over the rear garden. Beside this is a less formal reception room with a beautiful marble fireplace. The independent living spaces are downstairs at garden level. There is a separate entrance to this floor that has two bedrooms with their own bathrooms and living areas with kitchenette. If new owners wished to turn this house back to a cohesive home, this level would probably be where they would house the kitchen with access to the garden. With the 32m-long south-facing garden, extending further out would be an option, subject to planning permission. There are many homes on the road that have done exactly this, so a quick knock into the neighbours may provide some design inspiration. Out front, there is parking for several cars in the gravel driveway. Although the road can get busy, particularly with school runs in the morning, the house is set back enough for the passing cars to go more or less unnoticed. Upstairs on the first floor there are four bedrooms, each with a cast-iron fireplace. There is also a shower room and separate WC that would benefit from an upgrade. [ Modernised, light-filled home minutes from Blackrock village for €1.395mOpens in new window ] There is so much potential at number 102 to create a home that will grow with a family, from toddlers needing room to play to young adults looking for a bit of independence within the home. The property is Ber-exempt, but as it currently uses electric storage heaters, new owners will probably want to investigate retrofitting. Recent sales on the road include number 59, which sold last summer for more than €1.515 million, according to the Property Price Register. This was a midterrace two-storey-over-basement property that was set out in flats and in need of renovation. Number 75 sold for €1.925 million last September. It was also midterrace and smaller than number 102, but restored to a high level. Interest in Marlborough Road is not just for the fine houses. The location in Dublin 4 is a huge pull when it comes to potential buyers. The street may feel exclusive and private, yet it is only 3km from St Stephen’s Green. For families with children of school-going age, Muckross Park College is on the road, while Sandford Park and Gonzaga are just across the way. Herbert Park is a short walk away, as are Donnybrook and Ranelagh villages. At weekends and on long summer evenings, the kids can turn left and be at Scoop in Ranelagh for a gelato in five minutes, while the adults can turn right and enjoy the short walk to Donnybrook Fair for a more sophisticated treat.

Title: Upgraded and extended home in Clonskeagh for €1.25m

Number 2 Beechmount Drive was a very different house in 2015. When the current owners bought the property 10 years ago, it had been lived in by two friends. The friends divided the house in two so they could both have their own living spaces, which resulted in a house that had two of everything, from doorbells to bathrooms. It has since undergone a complete renovation, with not much left of the original house, bar the door frame and the external walls at the front. The ground floor was extended, and the garage was converted, with extra accommodation added above it. With a floor area of 205sq m (2,207sq ft), the semidetached home is on the market through DNG, seeking €1.25m. The new layout downstairs caters for every situation. At the back is a large open-plan kitchen with units by Glenwise in Kimmage. There is enough room for a living area and dining area, which is ideal when entertaining. Through sliding pocket doors is a cosy TV room with bespoke storage units, also making it a good option for a playroom. At the front of the house is a livingroom with solid-fuel stove and an office on the other side of the hallway. There is also a guest loo and utility room on the ground floor. Upstairs there are three double bedrooms. The original box room was taken out and used as an en suite and dressingroom for the main bedroom, as well as to make room for a staircase up to the converted attic. The main bathroom has a separate bath and shower, and the attic has also been plumbed, so new owners could add another bathroom. [ Double-fronted Victorian home close to the sea in Clontarf for €2.495mOpens in new window ] The house was renovated with a view that the owners would stay forever, so they put the best of everything into it. There are small things in the house that will make a big difference to daily life such as the laundry chute in the hot press upstairs that goes down to the utility room, and the charging drawer in the kitchen where you can plug in your devices. The Ber rating was brought up to an impressive B2 following the renovations, which included high levels of insulation, the installation of underfloor heating on the ground floor as well as solar panels on the roof that heat the water.

From Nigel Farage to Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, here are the competitors for the position of Europe's Trump whisperer. By NICHOLAS VINOCUR and JACOPO BARIGAZZI AI generated Text-to-speech Europe has discovered a new competitive sport: jockeying to get close to United States President Donald Trump. The first high-stakes interaction seemed to go badly. The fiery phone call between Trump and Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen was so alarming that she promptly set off on a European tour to shore up support in Berlin, Brussels and Paris against America seizing Greenland. For other leaders, the big fear is that the newly installed president could impose punishing tariffs. But will he actually listen? Is there anyone in Brussels or elsewhere in Europe who really has his ear? European politicians are lining up to explain why they should be the ones to “interpret” the bloc’s thorny politics to the U.S. president. The invitation list for his inauguration, however, suggested the Trump camp was closer to several far-right politicians than mainstream national leaders. In an attempt to shed light on who stands where in Trump’s international pecking order, POLITICO has put together a guide to the key aspiring “Trump whisperers” in Europe and ranked them on their “Trump-compatibility.” Here we go: When it comes to currying favor with Trump, Italy’s right-wing prime minister is at the front of the line. Before she became the only European Union leader to be invited to Trump’s Jan. 20 inauguration, Meloni met with the Republican leader during a huddle facilitated by tech billionaire Elon Musk at the reopening of the fire-damaged Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris in December. Then there was a private huddle earlier this month at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida, following which he called Meloni “a fantastic woman” and gave her a domestic win by helping her negotiate a hostage release in Iran. Trump’s willingness to meet Meloni face-to-face puts her in a league of her own in terms of access compared to other European leaders like French President Emmanuel Macron or German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. Significantly, Meloni’s foreign minister is one of only four EU ministers to have spoken with Secretary of State Marco Rubio since Jan. 20. That said, it remains to be seen just how deep Meloni’s connection goes. She also maintained close ties with the administration of previous U.S. President Joe Biden before Trump’s election victory, a point that may be held against her by Trump’s MAGA entourage. Another black mark: Italy’s defense spending, which is below 2 percent of gross domestic product and will shrink in 2025, is far from Trump’s desired goal of 5 percent of GDP for European countries. Finally, Meloni’s coziness with Musk could become a disadvantage if the tech mogul suddenly loses sway with Trump. But what look like drawbacks may well help Meloni in the end, argues Beniamino Irdi, a nonresident senior fellow with the Atlantic Council. Low defense spending “puts her in the unique position of being perhaps the only one amongst the bad players [like Spain or Belgium] who speaks the same language as Trump. And she has a very big stake in trying to valorize this affinity,” he said. — By Hannah Roberts Trump compatibility score: Hungary’s strongman leader is another contender for the position of Trump’s “chief whisperer” in Europe. The illiberal ruler of Hungary bagged not one but two invitations to Mar-a-Lago in 2024, and has been effusive in his praise of the MAGA leader for years. Trump has returned the favor by repeatedly name-checking Orbán in his speeches, even calling him a “great man.” There are also extensive contacts between Trump allies in Washington and Orbán’s friends in Budapest, who contributed to the “Project 2025” plan for Trump’s second term prepared by the right-wing Heritage Foundation think tank. However, Orbán’s pro-Russian and pro-Chinese policies may put a serious damper on his popularity with Trump in office. While Trump threatens sanctions against Russia to force it to stop its war against Ukraine, Hungary has stood in the way, this week threatening to block the rollover of EU sanctions against Moscow. Orbán has also gone out of his way to court Chinese business interests, inviting Beijing-backed corporations to build railways and electric vehicle factories in his country. What’s more, the prime minister has publicly pushed back on Trump’s request that EU countries spend 5 percent of their GDP on defense. At this stage, even the Hungarians are hedging about their Trump-compatibility. “The question of becoming a bridge between the U.S. administration and the EU is relevant only if the U.S. administration is looking for such a bridge, which cannot be taken for granted,” said János Bóka, Hungary’s EU affairs minister. Hungary doesn’t “pretend to speak on behalf of the European Union, and we don’t pretend to have a mandate to negotiate or to facilitate any agreement between the European Union and the United States,” he told a small group of journalists last week. Move to the back of the line, Viktor. — By Jacopo Barigazzi Trump compatibility score: These Polish right-wingers are as MAGA-compatible as it gets. Speaking to POLITICO in December, Morawiecki said that together with Italian Prime Minister Meloni, he would be “an ideal intermediary between the United States and Europe.” That must have pleased some people close to Trump because Morawiecki, along with other hard-right EU politicians, scored an invitation to the inauguration. To prove his loyalty, Morawiecki posted a picture of himself in front of Trump and Vice President JD Vance, writing that a “wind of change” was blowing “faster and faster toward Poland.” Duda, for his part, is among the European leaders Trump knows best after meeting him several times during his first term. (That said, Duda is leaving office in May, and Trump didn’t have any time to spare for him in September when he abruptly canceled a planned meeting.) For now, Poland’s MAGA allies are playing second fiddle to Meloni, even though Warsaw is doing far better than Rome in terms of defense spending. The big question now is whether one of Duda and Morawiecki’s allies will win a presidential election in May. If Karol Nawrocki, who is backed by their Law and Justice party, becomes Polish president, the bridge to Trump may be preserved. If not, that privilege will likely be lost to Poland’s current prime minister, Donald Tusk. — By Nick Vinocur Trump compatibility score: The Brexiteer-in-chief has long boasted of his friendship with Trump, celebrating the latter’s win on election night in Mar-a-Lago and joining the inauguration glitz as part of a cast of global right-wingers. He has even talked up the idea he would do a better job as U.S. ambassador than Britain’s actual pick — and Trump has returned the favor by praising him as a “handsome” man after his own image. The pair’s politics are firmly aligned, and Farage has long plied the same smash-the-establishment message as Trump as he tries to unsettle Britain’s Labour government. Yet it’s not all sweetness and light: The Reform UK leader has found himself decidedly out of favor of late with Trump’s right hand man, Musk, with the pair clashing over Musk’s backing of a jailed British far-right agitator deemed too extreme for Farage. Add to that the fact that Farage isn’t a head of state or government and comes from an island nation that has commanded steadily less of Trump’s attention. — By Matt Honeycombe-Foster Trump compatibility score: The French far-right flamethrower’s relationship with Trump dates back to at least 2022, when Éric Zemmour let it be known that he was getting political advice from the man who would become the 47th president of the United States. The revelation came as something of a surprise. Though Zemmour had modeled his presidential campaign on Trump’s, embracing the role of a culture warrior unafraid to create buzz by being controversial, the then-ex president’s reputation was at its lowest. At the time, a Trump return to the White House seemed a pipe dream after a second impeachment, making the idea of the French commentator-turned-presidential-candidate’s aligning himself with a disgraced leader seem foolish. Zemmour’s campaign eventually petered out, and so did his political relevance. So it came as a surprise when POLITICO discovered that Zemmour and his political and romantic partner, member of the European Parliament Sarah Knafo, had got their hands on tickets to the inauguration. In terms of politics, Trump and Zemmour aren’t a perfect fit, as Trump’s protectionist economic beliefs align better with Marine Le Pen’s far-right movement, the National Rally, than with those of Zemmour’s party, Reconquest. But Trump has made it clear he values loyalty and respect, and it was Zemmour who reached out during the president’s darkest days. — By Clea Caulcutt Trump compatibility score: A teacher by trade who embodies plucky bonhomie, Rutte isn’t the most obvious sparring partner for Trump. But thanks to his lengthy leadership experience in the Netherlands, where he was prime minister for 14 years, and his current big job at NATO, Mark Rutte may be at the front of the line when it comes to whispering in POTUS’s ear. Quite simply, Rutte is the man Trump is relying on to force Europeans to start spending more on defense. The Dutchman has taken to this role with relish, telling locals that Donald is “right” when it comes to Europeans taking more responsibility for their own defense, and warning them that Russia may be knocking on their doors next if they fail to step up. He’s also one of the few Europeans to have been invited to Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence. To be sure, Trump held back on praising Rutte after their meeting. The Dutchman is also a lifelong centrist and doesn’t share any obvious ideological similarities with Trump. But Rutte, like Trump, is a dealmaker who has something to offer. And that could prove more valuable in the long run than political alignment. — By Nick Vinocur Trump compatibility score: This pairing isn’t a natural fit for Trump. As former head of the European Council (an institution Trump has taken to ignoring) and an opponent of the Law and Justice party, Donald Tusk is at odds with Trump’s natural hard-right allies in Poland (see above). Meanwhile, Radosław Sikorski is an Atlanticist whose wife, The Atlantic writer Anne Applebaum, is a prominent Trump critic. However, as with Rutte, Trump’s need to engage with key defensive players in Europe means the U.S. president may look beyond any ideological difference and end up having more to do with this pair than with other EU leaders. Indeed, Sikorski was one of the first European foreign ministers to speak to Marco Rubio following his confirmation as secretary of state. It helps that Poland is on course to meet Trump’s defense spending target of 5 percent of GDP before any other European country, making Warsaw “top of the class” in Washington’s eyes. Some commentators have latched on to this fact, dubbing Tusk the “most likely to become Trump’s whisperer” in Europe. What could spoil the party, however, is if Law and Justice candidate Nawrocki becomes Polish president in an upcoming election. — By Nick Vinocur Trump compatibility score: Friedrich Merz’s connection with Trump is all about power and position. Put simply, Merz is on course to become leader of Europe’s top economy, which would make him a natural counterpart for the U.S. president. Merz himself has recognized this role, saying in an interview last week that “Germany must take on a leading role” in negotiations with Trump. This could happen, he has said, if Germany bought F-35 fighter jets from the U.S. but maintained them at home, building any necessary factories: “That would be a good deal for both sides,” he claimed. The conservative heavyweight’s confidence seems to flow mostly from his business background. Merz is a corporate lawyer by trade who has spent most of the past two decades quietly stewing while sitting on company boards — including at BlackRock — and making a small fortune. He’s also known for bashing the progressive left for its gender debates while talking up his anti-immigration credentials. Remarkably, he has been spared from the attacks of Musk, who has referred to the incumbent center-left chancellor, Scholz, as “a fool,” while endorsing far-right German politician Alice Weidel. Whether Merz will be capable of turning the page when it comes to dealing with Trump remains questionable. Trump notoriously detested former Chancellor Angela Merkel, and while Merz tried to approach Trump via a handwritten letter congratulating him on his inauguration, there has been no known contact between the two men. That said, Trump likes power. And as of Feb. 24, Merz may well be Europe’s most powerful politician. — By Nette Nöstlinger Trump compatibility score: The French president is giving Trump a dose of “je t’aime, moi non plus.” (“I love you, me neither,” the title of an old Serge Gainsbourg/Brigitte Bardot song.) After rushing to congratulate Trump on his election victory in November, Emmanuel Macron also warned that Europe needs to start flexing its muscles if it wants to earn the respect of the new U.S. president. Macron was not present at Trump’s inauguration, nor did he receive an official invitation, according to French diplomats. But insiders point to Trump’s decision to attend the reopening of Notre Dame Cathedral as a sign of Macron’s influence with the new U.S. administration. It was on the sidelines of that visit that Trump met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to discuss the future of U.S. support for Kyiv. Macron’s tough-love approach might work with the Donald, who clearly appeared to enjoy knuckle-crunching handshakes with the French president in his first mandate (these handshake battles have also resumed). Trump has called Macron a “very nice guy” but also a “wise guy,” and loves to boast that he got Macron to fold in an escalating trade war with France. But with Trump putting even more emphasis on allegiance in his second mandate, it’s unlikely Macron has the right recipe to get through to him. — By Clea Caulcutt Trump compatibility score: This trio is at the top of the food chain when it comes to power in the EU institutions. For Trump, however, they’re at the bottom of the pile of preferred foreign partners. Commenting on Trump’s preference for engaging with national leaders rather than with the EU, one EU diplomat said: “He’s clearly shown that he wants to do bilateral relations. This may be a negotiating tactic, as he knows he will have to deal with the EU on trade, but it’s potentially problematic.” Indeed, in the face of Trump’s cold shoulder, top EU representatives are trying out two — seemingly contradictory — strategies. The first is to signal openness to engage with Trump, and Kaja Kallas invited his top diplomat to attend a high-level European gathering. The second is to signal to Trump that Europe has relationships with other powerful countries around the world, as Ursula von der Leyen did in a recent speech in Davos, Switzerland, where she touted EU relations with India and Latin America over the United States. At the end of the day, Trump will have to speak to the EU. But the first days of his presidency have made it clear where he places the bloc on his list of priorities: Way down at the bottom. — By Nick Vinocur Trump compatibility score:

Title: NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) Reports 33% QoQ EPS Growth in Q3 2024, Driven by Exceptional Profitability and AI Innovation

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Goldman Sachs’ 35 AI Superstars. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other AI stocks. In September 2024, Peter Oppenheimer, the chief of global equity strategy and the head of macro research for Goldman Sachs in Europe, opined that the rise of tech stocks due to the AI boom was not indicative of a financial bubble. Instead, per the Goldman bigwig, the performance of these companies was expected to continue delivering solid returns to investors, fueled by the rise of AI superstars outside of the magnificent seven, among smaller tech firms and in non-tech sectors. In the months since, the AI hype has only grown stronger, leading to a massive surge in the value of tech offerings, only offset by the recent emergence of Chinese AI startup DeepSeek which is positioning itself as a budget ChatGPT. The success of this Chinese startup, popularized by the downloads that the DeepSeek application has achieved on the mobile operating system markets, has led to a downward spiral in American tech futures. Although the tech sector selloff has caught many investors by surprise, a new investor note by Goldman Sachs, as seen by news agency Reuters, contends that hedge funds were already anticipating this slump. Per the Goldman report, in the last two weeks, hedge funds have significantly reduced their positions in technology stocks. This retreat is part of a broader trend, as hedge funds have remained hesitant to reinvest in tech-related sectors following the sell-off from June to August last year. Alongside selling major technology stocks, hedge funds have also been offloading shares in adjacent industries, such as power and energy companies that would benefit from AI advancements—especially those supporting data centers and electric vehicle infrastructure. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. However, Goldman remains bullish on AI futures. Per Oppenheimer, tech stocks have dominated global and US equity returns since 2010, contributing 32% and 40%, respectively. The Goldman executive further claims that unlike speculative bubbles, these gains are backed by strong financials, with tech sector earnings per share surging 400% since the 2008 financial crisis, compared to a modest 25% increase across other sectors. Hyperscale companies in software and cloud computing have been key drivers of this growth, leveraging their vast resources and high profitability, he notes. Recent AI advancements have further boosted their valuations, concentrating gains among a few market leaders. Oppenheimer highlights that this pattern is consistent with past technological innovations, where capital inflows and competition drive rapid growth before eventual consolidation. While dominant AI companies today were also leaders in the previous tech wave, new competitors are emerging, he predicts. The report further notes that the number of AI patents jumped from 8,000 in 2018 to over 60,000 in 2022, signaling growing competition. History suggests that the companies pioneering a technology may not be the ones to benefit most in the long run, Oppenheimer claims. Just as internet infrastructure investments paved the way for social media and ride-sharing dominance, the greatest value in AI may emerge from new players that leverage current advancements in unexpected ways, per the Goldman strategist. The Oppenheimer point of view is echoed in the latest Goldman report. This report highlights that over the past year, hedge funds have been more inclined to sell rather than buy stocks that would typically gain value from a US-driven AI boom. Read more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities. However, a smaller group of hedge funds has maintained long positions, meaning they are betting that stock values will rise. In fact, these hedge funds currently hold the highest number of long positions in two years, indicating some confidence in future AI-driven growth, the report adds. Goldman underlines that the investment climate in AI has been heavily influenced by substantial spending from major US technology firms. Following the success of ChatGPT, companies have invested tens of billions of dollars in AI infrastructure. Notably, OpenAI and SoftBank recently committed $19 billion to fund Stargate, a joint venture aimed at developing AI data centers in the United States. Despite these large-scale investments, competition from international players such as Chinese AI startup DeepSeek has raised concerns about the long-term sustainability of US leadership in the AI sector. Bruno Schneller, managing director at Erlen Capital Management, noted that hedge funds are adopting a cautious wait-and-see approach toward US AI-related stocks. Schneller further highlighted that large projects like Stargate come with significant regulatory complexities. The ongoing uncertainty regarding regulatory execution and enforcement has left many investors wary, contributing to the market’s volatility. While the US AI sector continues to receive significant investments, hedge funds remain uncertain about its profitability in the face of growing international competition and regulatory uncertainties. This cautious stance has led to stock market fluctuations, with many hedge funds opting to sell their tech-related holdings while a select few continue to maintain long positions, betting on future growth. Our Methodology For this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through a note on the AI industry by investment bank Goldman Sachs. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.

For instance, the report for the third quarter of year 2024 reflects the company's exceptional growth in profitability. For the quarter, GAAP earnings per diluted share was $4.93, increasing 33% from the previous quarter and a 765% increase from a year ago. Additionally, non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $5.16, increasing 28% from the previous quarter and 486% rise from the previous year. Moreover, the NVIDIA Cosmos platform plans to advance physical AI with new models and video data processing pipelines for robots, autonomous vehicles and vision AI. Lastly, the company aims to revolutionize graphics with the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 GPU, the most powerful GeForce RTX GPU so far, with 92 billion transistors and delivering 3,352 trillion AI operations per second (TOPS).

Title: Robinhood CEO warns US risks losing financial edge without tokenization clarity

Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev warned that the US could lose its competitive edge in financial markets if regulators fail to provide clear rules for tokenized securities. In a Jan. 28 op-ed for The Washington Post, Tenev argued that blockchain-based financial assets could broaden investment opportunities, allowing retail investors to participate in the early growth of high-profile private companies like OpenAI, SpaceX, and Stripe. He highlighted that these firms have increasingly avoided public markets, limiting investment access to only the wealthiest individuals and widening the gap between institutional and retail investors. According to Tenev: “The world is tokenizing, and the United States should not get left behind. It’s time to update our conversation about crypto from bitcoin and meme coins to what blockchain is really making possible: A new era of ultra-inclusive and customizable investing fit for this century.” Tenev outlined a path for regulators to integrate tokenized securities into the financial system, proposing a security token registration framework as an alternative to traditional IPOs. He argued that companies should have a regulated option to issue tokenized equity, which would provide retail investors with early access to high-growth firms while maintaining proper disclosures and investor protections. Additionally, he called for clear guidelines that would allow exchanges and broker-dealers to facilitate the trading of tokenized assets, ensuring liquidity and market stability. Tenev also noted that the SEC’s accredited investor rule, which currently restricts private market investments to individuals meeting high-income or net-worth thresholds, is another critical issue for the industry. He suggested updating the rule to allow broader participation based on financial literacy rather than wealth alone, a move he believes would democratize investment opportunities and bring US markets in line with other jurisdictions that have adopted more inclusive policies. Tenev’s remarks reflect a growing push among financial leaders for regulatory clarity on tokenization. He recently urged the SEC to approve tokenization efforts to modernize traditional finance. Meanwhile, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink recently called tokenized securities the “next frontier” in financial markets, arguing that the tokenization of stocks and bonds could make capital markets more efficient. Industry analysts expect tokenization to become a multitrillion-dollar market in the coming years, with McKinsey, BCG, and Bernstein forecasting a rapid expansion of blockchain-based real-world assets. Institutions and even governments are increasingly exploring tokenization for bonds, funds, commodities, and real estate, seeking faster settlement times and broader investor participation. Despite mounting industry support, US regulators have yet to establish a clear framework, raising concerns that the country could fall behind financial hubs like the EU, Singapore, and Abu Dhabi. Tenev warned that unless the US acts swiftly, it risks losing its leadership in capital markets as other jurisdictions embrace the next phase of financial innovation.

Title: Bond Traders Are Kept in Limbo After Powell Offers Few Clues

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. (Bloomberg) -- Bond traders emerged from the Federal Reserve’s meeting exactly where they were before it began: with little conviction about where interest rates are headed as President Donald Trump casts uncertainty over the direction of the economy. Most Read from Bloomberg Trump's Federal Funding Pause Threatens State Financials Manhattan’s Morning Commute Time Drops With New Congestion Toll Housing Aid Uncertain After Trump’s Spending Freeze Memo US Students’ Reading Scores Drop to Worst in More Than 20 Years Texas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters Treasury yields briefly jumped after the central bank’s statement appeared to indicate that it held rates steady because its progress on taming inflation had ebbed. But Chair Jerome Powell quickly swatted away those worries — saying he expects consumer-price increases to continue to slow — and yields came back down, ending the day virtually unchanged and echoing the swings in the US equity market. “This is a Fed that’s not in a hurry to take any further action,” Jeffrey Rosenberg, portfolio manager at BlackRock Inc., said on Bloomberg Television. The Fed’s decision to pause the cycle of interest-rate cuts it kicked off in September was already widely anticipated on Wall Street. Since late last year, yields have risen sharply on expectations that the resilient economy, sticky inflation and policy shifts by Trump would prevent the US central bank from easing monetary policy much further. The repricing had left traders largely in sync with the Fed, which has adopted a wait-and-see approach as it watches for inflation to come back closer to its 2% target. Trump has also cast considerable uncertainty over the outlook by threatening to slap tariffs on imports and promising to lower taxes, both of which could put upward pressure on inflation and pour another round of stimulus onto the economy. Powell did little to chart the bond market’s direction one way or the other. He said he expects that the still-restrictive level of interest rates will continue to slow inflation, which appeared to ease some concern that the Fed could shift gears to raising interest rates again. He also declined to comment on how Trump’s policies may affect the Fed’s path, underscoring that the bank will follow where the data lead. “This does not sound like a Fed that’s looking for the next opportunity to cut rates,” Bob Michele, JPMorgan Asset Management’s chief investment officer for global fixed income, said on Bloomberg Television. After Powell’s comments supported that speculation, swaps traders pared back their expectations for rate reductions this year by pricing in 43 basis points of cuts compared to 48 before the Fed’s announcement, with the first not coming until mid-2025. That shows traders anticipate just one quarter-point reduction this year, with the potential of a second such move. The stock market’s reaction was similar to the bond market’s. The S&P 500 Index dropped after the Fed’s announcement only to recover once Powell spoke. It ended slightly lower on the day, held down by worries about Trump’s still-unclear tariff policies and the threat to tech stocks posed by a Chinese company’s rollout of a low-cost artificial intelligence product. Treasury bonds ended Wednesday’s session little changed across the curve. The benchmark 10-year note — a key baseline for other debt — was flat at 4.53%, while the yield on two-year Treasuries was up 2 basis points at around 4.2%. What Bloomberg strategists say... “Policymakers are in a wait-and-see mode on how Trump’s policies play out. Powell also noted there have been two good inflation readings in a row and importantly expectations at the back-end are not going up, where it really matters.” — Alyce Andres, strategist. Read more on MLIV. For the bond market, the focus remains squarely on whether — and when — the Fed will cut rates next. “There’s heightened caution in the bond market at the moment,” said Lon Erickson, a portfolio manager at Thornburg Investment Management in Santa Fe, New Mexico. “There’s nervousness around the outcome of those policies of the administration.” While expectations for a March rate reduction had increased earlier this week during a tech-driven rout in stocks that fueled demand for Treasuries, the swaps market is now pricing only a narrow chance of such a reduction. Still, traders had ratcheted up bullish bets on Treasuries in the leadup to the meeting in hopes of a signal from the Fed that a move in March was on the table. Wall Street economists, meanwhile, have diverged on their forecasts for the Fed’s policy path, though most have trimmed their expectations in recent months. Ahead of the January meeting, only Morgan Stanley was among major Wall Street banks that still saw a potential reduction at the next gathering in March. “For the bond market, we think it’s a holding pattern for the next couple of quarters,” Guneet Dhingra, head of US rates strategy at BNP Paribas, said just ahead of the decision. “We think the Fed is on hold for the remainder of 2025.” --With assistance from Kristine Aquino and Edward Bolingbroke.

EV maker Rivian (RIVN) is giving back 3% today after wealth manager Bernstein started coverage of the shares with an Underperform rating. Why Bernstein Is Bearish on RIVN Bernstein believes that the automaker can achieve its goal of handing over 500,000 EVs by 2030, but the wealth manager does not believe that RIVN's attainment of this milestone will provide its shareholders with "financial success." A state-of-the-art electric vehicle charging at a station at a suburban mall. That's because, according to Bernstein, the company's gross margins will only be about 15% by the end of this decade. Additionally, Bernstein believes that Rivian will burn $14 billion of cash before it breaks even. Finally, RIVN will be hindered by the decelerating growth of its markets, stepped-up competition, and the relatively low ceiling of its addressable market, Bernstein warned. The wealth manager placed a $6.10 price target on the name. Rivian Not "Particularly Worried" by Trump's Policies On Jan. 23, RIVN CEO RJ Scaringe said that he was not "particularly worried" about the Trump administration's anti-EV stance. “I don’t think we’re particularly worried about any of it because whatever happens will be equally applied to all, I think in the end it’s sort of like there’s small speed bumps along the way and it’s on us to respond to whatever that environment is,” the CEO explained. While we acknowledge the potential of RIVN, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than RIVN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Ireland U20s braced for clash with impressive world champions

Ireland’s nemesis from last season come to Cork on Thursday night as Under-20 Six Nations and World Cup champions, and en route to those titles England twice found a way past Ireland. Mark Mapletoft’s squad prevented Ireland from winning a third successive Grand Slam, when the sides drew 32-32 in a lavishly entertaining encounter at The Rec in Bath. When the dust settled at tournament’s end, England had one more bonus point than their rivals to claim the title. Later in the summer they had a little more leeway on the scoreboard in beating Ireland in a World Cup semi-final before dethroning the reigning champions France in the final. Eight of England’s starting team on Thursday night shared in that world triumph while another two on the bench, Lucas Friday and Josh Bellamy, were part of that success. Northampton Saints scrumhalf Archie McParland played against Ireland in the game last season, while more recently he got a run against Munster in the Champions Cup. The majority of the England team have played for their clubs in the Premiership, while some have also togged out in Europe. Right wing Jack Bracken is a son of Skerries-born former England scrumhalf Kyran Bracken, Henry Pollock is one of the best young players in the world game and was seconded from the senior squad to play, while Junior Kpoku, younger brother of Joel and Jonathan, is a 6ft 8in flanker who has shifted from the second row and plays for Racing in Paris. Ireland’s injury profile has denied them some of last year’s side, Alan Spicer, Shannon duo Luke Murphy and Emmet Calvey, Niall Smyth, Todd Lawlor and hugely promising scrumhalf Will Wootton, younger brother of former Connacht and Munster wing, Alex. There wasn’t any clarification on injuries but it’s a pity Tullamore’s Páidí Farrell, a rare sighting in Irish rugby – a player with top end pace – isn’t getting a run. The home side have a new head coach in Neil Doak, while Séamus Toomey and Andrew Browne have joined Ian Keatley as assistant coaches. Four of Ireland’s front five in the pack have played at this level, including prop Alex Usanov who went on to play for Emerging Ireland in South Africa. Henry Walker, Alex Mullan and Billy Corrigan understand what’s required at this level. Ciarán Mangan, younger brother of Diarmuid, fullback Charlie Molony, centre Connor Fahy, secondrows Corrigan and Mahon Ronan have all played for Leinster A, while centre Eoghan Smyth, the promising Michael Foy and Gene O’Leary Kareem on the bench did so for Munster. Cork-born, Connacht academy prospect Éanna McCarthy captains the team and is joined by flanker Bobby Power and prop Billy Bohan, who were part of the Connacht A scene, while Walker, Clarke Logan, Tom McAllister, Connor Magee and David Green enjoyed that status with Ulster. Doak acknowledged: “The first 20 minutes is key for us, that we get to the level of the game and then stay in there. Like most teams, you have a plan and sometimes you have to adapt to that. We try to make sure that the players are able to solve any problems on the night. “This process it’s part developmental and part performance. From my point of view, all I’m trying to do is get the players the best framework to work from and then they’ve got to problem solve on the pitch. “We can anticipate what England might throw at us, we can anticipate what defensive shapes they may look at, but ultimately on the night, it’s about the players making really clear decisions, going after that and being as positive as they can.” There were a couple of hundred tickets left in midweek, but the game is expected to sell-out, guaranteeing the wonderful atmosphere that’s been a hallmark of Ireland’s run of success at the Cork venue. The home side will have to absorb and channel all that positivity against an England team that are short odds favourites. IRELAND UNDER-20: C Molony (UCD); D Moloney (Blackrock College), C Fahy (Clontarf), E Smyth (Cork Constitution), C Mangan (Blackrock College); S Wisniewski (Old Belvedere), C Logan (QUB); A Usanov (Clontarf), H Walker (QUB), A Mullan (Blackrock College); M Ronan (Old Wesley); Billy Corrigan (Old Wesley); M Foy (UCC), B Power (Galwegians), É McCarthy (Galwegians, capt). Replacements: C Magee (Banbridge), B Bohan (Galway Corinthians), T McAllister (Ballynahinch), D Walsh (Terenure College), O Minogue (Shannon), A Doyle (Old Wesley), G O’Leary Kareem (UCC), D Green (QUB). ENGLAND UNDER-20: J Kinder (Leicester Tigers); J Bracken (Saracens), A Hall (Saracens), N Allison (Exeter Chiefs), C Griffin (Bath); B Coen (Exeter Chiefs), A McParland (Northampton Saints); R McEachran (Sale Sharks), K Tuipolotu (Bath), V Sela (Bath); O Sodeke (Saracens), T Burrow (Sale Sharks), J Kpoku (Racing 92), H Pollock (Northampton Saints), K James (Exeter Chiefs).

Title: Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR) Reports Strong US Revenue Growth, Expands $400M+ US Army Partnership

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Goldman Sachs’ 35 AI Superstars. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) stands against the other AI stocks. In September 2024, Peter Oppenheimer, the chief of global equity strategy and the head of macro research for Goldman Sachs in Europe, opined that the rise of tech stocks due to the AI boom was not indicative of a financial bubble. Instead, per the Goldman bigwig, the performance of these companies was expected to continue delivering solid returns to investors, fueled by the rise of AI superstars outside of the magnificent seven, among smaller tech firms and in non-tech sectors. In the months since, the AI hype has only grown stronger, leading to a massive surge in the value of tech offerings, only offset by the recent emergence of Chinese AI startup DeepSeek which is positioning itself as a budget ChatGPT. The success of this Chinese startup, popularized by the downloads that the DeepSeek application has achieved on the mobile operating system markets, has led to a downward spiral in American tech futures. Although the tech sector selloff has caught many investors by surprise, a new investor note by Goldman Sachs, as seen by news agency Reuters, contends that hedge funds were already anticipating this slump. Per the Goldman report, in the last two weeks, hedge funds have significantly reduced their positions in technology stocks. This retreat is part of a broader trend, as hedge funds have remained hesitant to reinvest in tech-related sectors following the sell-off from June to August last year. Alongside selling major technology stocks, hedge funds have also been offloading shares in adjacent industries, such as power and energy companies that would benefit from AI advancements—especially those supporting data centers and electric vehicle infrastructure. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. However, Goldman remains bullish on AI futures. Per Oppenheimer, tech stocks have dominated global and US equity returns since 2010, contributing 32% and 40%, respectively. The Goldman executive further claims that unlike speculative bubbles, these gains are backed by strong financials, with tech sector earnings per share surging 400% since the 2008 financial crisis, compared to a modest 25% increase across other sectors. Hyperscale companies in software and cloud computing have been key drivers of this growth, leveraging their vast resources and high profitability, he notes. Recent AI advancements have further boosted their valuations, concentrating gains among a few market leaders. Oppenheimer highlights that this pattern is consistent with past technological innovations, where capital inflows and competition drive rapid growth before eventual consolidation. While dominant AI companies today were also leaders in the previous tech wave, new competitors are emerging, he predicts. The report further notes that the number of AI patents jumped from 8,000 in 2018 to over 60,000 in 2022, signaling growing competition. History suggests that the companies pioneering a technology may not be the ones to benefit most in the long run, Oppenheimer claims. Just as internet infrastructure investments paved the way for social media and ride-sharing dominance, the greatest value in AI may emerge from new players that leverage current advancements in unexpected ways, per the Goldman strategist. The Oppenheimer point of view is echoed in the latest Goldman report. This report highlights that over the past year, hedge funds have been more inclined to sell rather than buy stocks that would typically gain value from a US-driven AI boom. Read more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities. However, a smaller group of hedge funds has maintained long positions, meaning they are betting that stock values will rise. In fact, these hedge funds currently hold the highest number of long positions in two years, indicating some confidence in future AI-driven growth, the report adds. Goldman underlines that the investment climate in AI has been heavily influenced by substantial spending from major US technology firms. Following the success of ChatGPT, companies have invested tens of billions of dollars in AI infrastructure. Notably, OpenAI and SoftBank recently committed $19 billion to fund Stargate, a joint venture aimed at developing AI data centers in the United States. Despite these large-scale investments, competition from international players such as Chinese AI startup DeepSeek has raised concerns about the long-term sustainability of US leadership in the AI sector. Bruno Schneller, managing director at Erlen Capital Management, noted that hedge funds are adopting a cautious wait-and-see approach toward US AI-related stocks. Schneller further highlighted that large projects like Stargate come with significant regulatory complexities. The ongoing uncertainty regarding regulatory execution and enforcement has left many investors wary, contributing to the market’s volatility. While the US AI sector continues to receive significant investments, hedge funds remain uncertain about its profitability in the face of growing international competition and regulatory uncertainties. This cautious stance has led to stock market fluctuations, with many hedge funds opting to sell their tech-related holdings while a select few continue to maintain long positions, betting on future growth. Our Methodology For this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through a note on the AI industry by investment bank Goldman Sachs. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A software engineer manipulating a vast network of code on virtual monitors. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 43 Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) is a public American company that specializes in software platforms for big data analytics. There are many aspects that contribute to this company being an excellent investment opportunity. Among them is the company’s consistent efforts to drive positive financial growth across all its quarters for the fiscal year 2024. For instance, as per the report for the third quarter of 2024, the US revenue grew 44% year-over-year and 14% quarter-over-quarter, reaching $499 million. This strong performance follows the second quarter of 2024, where US commercial revenue increased 55% year-over-year and 6% quarter-over-quarter, totaling $159 million. Similarly, in the first quarter of 2024, US commercial revenue saw a 40% year-over-year growth and a 14% quarter-over-quarter increase, reaching $150 million. Moreover, the company’s extended long-term partnership with the US Army to deliver the Army Vantage capability in support of the Army Data Platform also positions the company as a strong investment choice. The total value of this agreement is $400,746,583 for a period of up to four years, with a total available ceiling of $618,871,428. Overall PLTR ranks 28th on our list of Goldman Sachs' AI superstars. While we acknowledge the potential of PLTR as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Title: Trumpcoins, Global Growth and Regulatory Battles Defined Crypto This Week
URL: https://www.pymnts.com/cryptocurrency/2025/trumpcoins-global-growth-and-regulatory-battles-defined-crypto-this-week/
Time Published: 2025-01-29T19:10:45Z
Full Content:
Political favor, institutional acceptance and regulatory scrutiny are increasingly colliding to redefine the digital asset landscape. At the heart of this transformation is the ongoing embrace of digital assets by U.S. President Donald Trump, whose administration has moved swiftly to position, or re-position, America as a global leader in the financial technology. As blockchain and cryptocurrency continue to work toward the heart of traditional finance, 2025 is shaping up to be a defining year for investors, businesses and regulators alike — one that could either cement crypto’s place in the global financial system or expose the industry’s lingering vulnerabilities. Either way, the era of digital assets operating in a regulatory gray zone appears to be ending. What comes next will depend on how the industry, and the policymakers shaping its future, navigate this new reality. Beyond politics and regulation, 2025 is already proving to be a year of significant institutional and geographic expansion for the global crypto sector. In Latin America, cryptocurrency adoption is accelerating, with PYMNTS reporting that Bybit is making inroads into taking crypto payments mainstream in Brazil with its new payment solution. According to a Monday (Jan. 27) press release, the Bybit Pay solution is live in Brazil and integrates with the Brazilian Pix instant payment system developed by the Central Bank of Brazil. This move enables users to make payments in both fiat currency and cryptocurrency. The launch of Bybit Pay would also seem to align with Latin America’s growing adoption of digital finance technologies and, in particular, Brazil’s emergence as a digital banking and payments superpower. As PYMNTS Intelligence has found in “How The World Does Digital: A Global Benchmark Of Consumer Digital Transformation,” Brazil leads the world in its digital engagement metrics. Elsewhere in Latin America, it’s all systems go for Coinbase to launch in Argentina after regulators in that South American nation gave their approval for the U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange to begin operating there, the company said Tuesday (Jan 28). But perhaps the most striking development in institutional adoption comes from the Czech National Bank (CNB), which is reportedly planning a multi-billion-euro bitcoin purchase. If confirmed, the move, announced Wednesday (Jan. 29), would make the Czech Republic the first Western nation to hold bitcoin as part of its reserves — a landmark shift in how central banks view digital assets. At the same time, blockchain technology is gaining traction within traditional financial markets. Ondo Finance said Tuesday (Jan. 28) that it will bring tokenized U.S. Treasuries to the XRP Ledger (XRPL). The collaboration will offer institutional investors access to Ondo Short-Term U.S. Government Treasuries (OUSG), which are backed by the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) and can be instantaneously minted and redeemed at any time using the Ripple USD (RLUSD) U.S. dollar-denominated stablecoin. The tokenization of RWAs has captured the imaginations of various players across payments, finance and commerce because it has the potential to make assets more liquid, accessible and efficient, PYMNTS reported last April. During the most recent Eurogroup meeting in January, the European Central Bank (ECB) provided an update on its exploratory work on tokenization and blockchain’s role in streamlining the wholesale settlement of transactions, reporting to the ministers present that the technology is capable of solving inefficiencies, reducing risks, and unlocking new opportunities within wholesale trade. This maturation of the cross-border landscape could ultimately redefine how growth-focused treasurers and CFOs manage global transactions, liquidity and risk. At the same time, and perhaps unsurprisingly, Elon Musk is reportedly considering using blockchain technology at the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), per a Saturday (Jan. 25) report. Musk, head of the newly created agency, has floated the idea of using a digital ledger to monitor federal spending, make payments, secure data and manage government buildings. Donald Trump’s return to the White House has given the crypto industry its most powerful political advocate yet. Just days into his second term, America’s first “crypto president” issued an executive order, titled “Strengthening American Leadership in Digital Financial Technology,” touching on many of the sector’s wants, needs and concerns. Now, however, Trump is leaning into digital assets — not just as a policy matter, but as a business opportunity. His media company, Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG), on Wednesday (Jan. 29) announced plans to expand into financial services, including cryptocurrency-related offerings. News broke the same day that websites selling products with President Donald Trump’s brand are now accepting the controversial $TRUMP meme coin as payment. The newfound support has also prompted shifts in institutional investment strategies. Per a Sunday (Jan. 26) report, venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz is even shutting down its U.K. office amid a new focus on the U.S. crypto sector following Donald Trump’s election. The investor opened the U.K. branch in 2023, its first outside the U.S., amid regulatory pressure in the U.S. The move back could underscore a belief that the U.S. is once again a more favorable jurisdiction for blockchain innovation — at least under the current administration. Separately, U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange Kraken now lets users make payments with their accounts. Kraken Pay allows users to choose the crypto or fiat currency in their accounts that they want to send and transmit that payment instantly, according to a Wednesday (Jan. 29) company blog post. While political support is boosting industry confidence, crypto firms are still facing regulatory headwinds. Governments across the globe are tightening compliance standards, cracking down on illicit activity, and enforcing penalties against firms accused of skirting financial regulations. French authorities recently launched a probe against Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, over allegations of money laundering. The investigation adds to Binance’s growing list of legal troubles, which include lawsuits and regulatory actions in multiple jurisdictions. Meanwhile, cryptocurrency exchange KuCoin will exit the U.S. market for at least two years after its operator, Seychelles-based Peken Global Limited, pleaded guilty Monday (Jan. 27) to one count of operating an unlicensed money transmitting business. Peken will also pay monetary penalties totaling more than $297 million, while two of its founders, Chun (Michael) Gan and Ke (Eric) Tang, will step down from any role in KuCoin’s management or operations. U.S. Attorney Danielle R. Sassoon said in the release that KuCoin avoided implementing required anti-money laundering (AML) policies for years. “As a result, KuCoin was used to facilitate billions of dollars’ worth of suspicious transactions and to transmit potentially criminal proceeds, including proceeds from darknet markets and malware, ransomware and fraud schemes,” Sassoon said. “Today’s guilty plea and penalties show the cost of refusing to follow these laws and allowing unlawful activity to continue.” We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

Title: Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan Says President Trump’s Executive Order Could End Crypto’s Four-Year Cycle – Here’s Why

Crypto’s traditional four-year cycle could come to an end because of President Trump’s executive order, according to Bitwise’s chief investment officer Matt Hougan. In a new note to investors, Hougan says that the four-year cycle appeared to be intact – until Trump came out with the “Strengthening American Leadership in Digital Financial Technology” executive order. The executive order directs the United States government to promote stablecoins, end regulatory persecution of digital assets, the evaluation of a national crypto reserve, and other initiatives. The four-year cycle is based on the idea that crypto follows Bitcoin’s halvings when BTC miners’ rewards are cut in half, which happen roughly every four years and tend to precede upward price movements. While the four-year cycle is widely accepted as the norm by many crypto investors, Hougan says that the pattern might now be broken due to the implications of Trump’s executive orders, the implications of which could take years to play out. “The thing I’m wrestling with is that the downstream positive effects of the EO, plus the other changes in Washington, will be felt over the course of years, not months. In the absolute best-case scenario, it will take a year to align on and implement a new regulatory framework for crypto. It will take longer than that for the behemoths on Wall Street to fully orient themselves to crypto’s possibilities. If it’s not until next year that we feel those impacts, will we really have a new “crypto winter” in 2026? Will investors go into hibernation even though they know we’ve entered a new crypto-enabled world? If BlackRock CEO Larry Fink is calling for $700k Bitcoin, are we really going to see a 70% pullback? My guess is that we haven’t fully overcome the four-year cycle. Leverage will build up as the bull market builds. Excess will appear. Bad actors will emerge. And at some point, there could be a sharp pullback when the market gets over its skis. But my guess is that any pullback will be shorter and shallower than in years past. Why? The crypto space has matured; there’s a greater variety of buyers and more value-oriented investors than ever before. I expect volatility, but I’m not sure I’d bet against crypto in 2026. As for now, it’s full steam ahead. The crypto train is leaving the station.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X, Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Title: Robinhood CEO Warns Lack of U.S. Regulation Stifles Security Tokenization Efforts

Time Published: 2025-01-29T18:33:15Z

Current U.S. regulations are blocking a major financial shift that could open up private-market investments to everyday investors through tokenization, CEO of digital brokerage Robinhood Vlad Tenev said. In a Wednesday opinion piece for the Washington Post, Tenev said that many high-growth companies like OpenAI, SpaceX and Stripe are increasingly avoiding going public, limiting investment access to a small circle of wealthy investors, widening the investment gap between retail investors. Tokenizing private equity through blockchain technology that underpins crypto markets would allow retail to access companies early in their growth phase, lowering barriers while keeping proper disclosures and investor protections, Tenev argued. "The world is tokenizing, and the United States should not get left behind," Tenev wrote. "It’s time to update our conversation about crypto from bitcoin and meme coins to what blockchain is really making possible: A new era of ultra-inclusive and customizable investing fit for this century." However, U.S. regulators, particularly the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), have yet to provide a clear framework and rules for registering security tokens, while other key markets such as the EU, Singapore and Abu Dhabi are already advancing in this area, he said. He proposed creating a security token registration framework as an alternative to IPOs, providing clear guidelines for exchanges and broker-dealers to support tokenized assets and updating accredited investor rules to allow access based on financial knowledge instead of wealth. Tokenization is a booming sector at the intersection of crypto and traditional finance that could become a multitrillion-dollar market this decade, per forecasts by McKinsey, BCG, 21Shares and Bernstein . Institutions and even governments are increasingly exploring placing real-world assets like bonds, funds and commodities and real estate on blockchain rails in a digital token form to achieve speedier settlements and broader investor accessibility. Tenev is the latest high-profile leader in the financial world touting tokenization and calling for clear rules for tokenized securities. Larry Fink, CEO of $10 trillion asset manager BlackRock, recently said that tokenization is the next frontier that will change markets, and urged the SEC in a CNBC interview to "rapidly approve" tokenization of stocks and bonds.

William Dudley, a former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and Chris LaCivita, a political consultant and co-manager of Trump’s 2024 campaign, are joining Coinbase’s global advisory council, the company said in a press release. Kyrsten Sinema, a former Democratic Arizona senator—who once proposed eliminating taxes on crypto transactions under $50—will also be joining the council, Coinbase said. What’s more, Allen & Co. Managing Director Luis Alberto Moreno, who serves on the Board of Trustees of the World Economic Forum (WEF), will round out the group, Coinbase added. Coinbase Chief Policy Officer Faryar Shirzad told Decrypt in a statement that the four new members represent “some of the brightest minds across finance, tech, and politics,” who will help guide Coinbase’s direction as “the world enters a new era for crypto.” Under the Biden administration, Coinbase faced heavy scrutiny from the SEC, which alleged that America’s leading crypto exchange violated agency rules in a now-frozen lawsuit. With Trump’s SEC apparently taking a crypto-friendlier bent with plans to bring about a sense of regulatory clarity, it appears Coinbase is taking on power players to advance its vision. “I believe we’ve reached a pivotal moment in crypto’s evolution,” Dudley, the former Fed policymaker, said in a statement. “Coinbase can ensure it is integrated into our financial system in a safe and beneficial way for Americans.” In 2018, as president of the New York Fed, Dudley warned that the “speculative mania around cryptocurrencies” was dangerous because of his perceived lack of underlying value, per the Wall Street Journal. While Bitcoin’s beginnings are rooted in a skepticism of the existing financial system—Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, embedded a message referencing bank bailouts in Bitcoin’s first block—Coinbase has embraced the industry’s ascent into the mainstream, working with companies who view blockchain as a natural evolution of financial markets. Coinbase first inked a partnership with BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, in 2022. While BlackRock CEO Larry Fink continues to promote Bitcoin, he’s also talked extensively about the benefits associated with the tokenization of securities. Following a recent trip to Davos, where the WEF holds its annual meeting, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said in a post on X that the exchange will work with corporate leaders, from banks to asset managers, as investments accelerate into crypto. “We need crypto to update the entire global financial system to bring these benefits to everyone,” he wrote. "They need an institutional-grade partner like Coinbase, who can build relentlessly through the winters, to feel confident getting into crypto.” Edited by Andrew Hayward Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2025 Decrypt Media, Inc.

Title: Czech Central Bank To Vote On €7 Billion Bitcoin Investment On Thursday
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/czech-central-bank-vote-7-billion-bitcoin/
Time Published: 2025-01-29T16:30:13Z
Full Content:
The Czech National Bank (CNB) is poised to decide on Thursday whether to allocate up to 5% of its €140 billion in foreign exchange reserves to Bitcoin, an amount totaling roughly €7 billion (roughly $7.31 billion). Governor Aleš Michl revealed the plan in an exclusive interview with the Financial Times, underlining a bold departure from the traditional asset strategies usually favored by major central banks. Michl, who previously worked as an investment fund manager, expressed his conviction that introducing BTC into the CNB’s portfolio could serve as a viable way to diversify holdings. “For the diversification of our assets, Bitcoin seems good,” he told the FT. He acknowledged the cryptocurrency’s “extreme volatility” and limited track record but pointed to rising institutional interest since global asset managers like BlackRock launched Bitcoin exchange-traded funds last year. Should the board approve the plan, the CNB could direct as much as 5% of its reserves—equivalent to approximately €7 billion—into Bitcoin. “Five percent [of our assets] is a lot of money, even for the Bitcoin market,” Michl noted, underscoring the potential impact of a sizable BTC purchase by a sovereign authority. Most central banks around the world have steered clear of BTC, preferring “safer” instruments such as highly rated government bonds. A few have ventured into equities, but public disclosures of Bitcoin holdings by these institutions (except for El Salvador) remain virtually nonexistent. Federal Reserve chair Jay Powell confirmed in December that the US central bank does not hold Bitcoin, while comparing it to gold, describing it as a virtual and digital speculative asset. Other top monetary officials in Europe have been notoriously critical. The governor of the Bundesbank, Joachim Nagel, likened Bitcoin to “digital tulips,” referencing the 17th-century speculative bubble. European Central Bank (ECB) officials have similarly argued that the “fair value of Bitcoin is still zero.” However, Michl struck a distinctly different tone. “I used to run an investment fund, so I’m a typical investment banker, I would say, I like profitability,” he told the FT. He also suggested more central banks might follow suit within the next five years, citing how some pension funds and commercial banks have begun holding BTC in their portfolios. Michl acknowledges the gamble: “It’s possible to have a big range of outcomes, that Bitcoin will have a value of zero or an absolutely fantastic value.” Yet he also drew attention to the historical examples of failed corporate investments, such as Enron and Wirecard, arguing that underperformance is an inherent risk of portfolio management. Internal CNB calculations suggest that if the central bank had held 5% of its foreign reserves in BTC over the past decade, its annual returns would have increased by 3.5%—albeit with double the volatility. “But I’m saying that my goal is to diversify the portfolio, so if Bitcoin is good [for that], then let’s have it,” Michl remarked. In the interview, Michl referenced US President Donald Trump’s pro-crypto stance and the growing influence of Bitcoin-focused executives in Washington. Last week, Trump issued an executive order to explore the creation of a national digital asset stockpile, fueling further discussions about crypto at the highest levels of government. While the Bitcoin proposal has captured headlines, the CNB already stands out for its relatively adventurous investment policy; 22% of its foreign exchange reserves are in equities—well above the norm for a central bank. Michl intends to increase US stock holdings to 50% of that equity portfolio within three years, up from the current 30%. “We are buying gradually and in very small steps because the [US stock] prices are the highest in history,” he explained. Whether the CNB board ultimately endorses Michl’s proposal to venture into BTC remains to be seen. If approved, the Czech National Bank could become the first major Western central bank to publicly hold crypto, setting a precedent that might inspire others—or serve as a cautionary tale. The CNB’s board meeting is scheduled for Thursday, with a final vote on the governor’s Bitcoin proposal expected shortly thereafter. At press time, BTC traded at $102,817.

Title: Institutions Are Primed for MicroStrategy's Preferred Stock Sale, Say Analysts
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/01/29/institutions-are-primed-for-microstrategy-s-preferred-stock-sale-data-suggests

Disclaimer: The analyst who wrote this piece owns shares of MicroStrategy (MSTR). To say that MicroStrategy (MSTR) has been at the lead of creatively raising capital with which to buy massive amounts of bitcoin (BTC) would be an understatement. Led by Executive Chairman Michael Saylor, the company this week opened a new front along those lines with its perpetual preferred stock offering (STRK). Preferred stock sits between equity and debt on the corporate balance sheet, offering investors the regular return of bonds while giving them an ownership stake in a company. Well-followed MicroStrategy analyst Ben Werkman, posted on X about the attraction preferred stock can offer institutional investors due to its lack of maturity risk, stable yield and optional equity upside. "I could see a scenario where [the preferred stock] starts taking some of the convertible bond space for fixed income accumulation due to the lack of any point in time maturity risk," said Werkman. "Preferred stock has the potential to be massively more accretive than any convertible offering has been and definitely more accretive than [share sales]." Similar sentiments came via Jeff Park, head of alpha strategies at Bitwise Investments, who called MSTR's preferred stock offering one of the most compelling securities in the market and a next-generation investment vehicle. "STRK is a near-perfect instrument," wrote Park. "It gives you two chances to win: First, when rates go down, it's a huge boon to the principal, and two, if MicroStrategy goes up first, then you have a deep in-the-money (ITM) option to convert and own the higher volatility asset or just directly sell." The largest of the U.S. preferred stock ETFs is the BlackRock iShares Preferred and Income Securities ETF (PFF), which has roughly $15 billion in assets under management. The largest holders of PFF ETF are major corporations such as Boeing (BA), Wells Fargo (WFC) and Citi Group (C). The final pricing terms of the new security are to be completed and announced after the market closes on Thursday.

Title: Saga sets sail with £450m HPS refinancing boost

Saga, the financial services and travel provider to the over-50s, is tapping one of the world's biggest investment firms as part of a refinancing aimed at relieving pressure on its balance sheet. Sky News has learnt that London-listed Saga is lining up HPS - which is in the process of being taken over by the asset management behemoth BlackRock - to help refinance more than £450m of its existing debt. Financiers said an agreement was likely to be announced alongside a scheduled trading update from the company on Thursday morning. Money latest: People who only watch Netflix or Disney 'may have to pay BBC licence fee' The debt involved in the deal comprises a bond, a loan from chairman Sir Roger De Haan and Saga's revolving credit facility. A refinancing will be a boost to Saga, which has been weighed down by a debt pile which is huge relative to the value of its equity. It will come months after the company struck a partnership deal with the Belgian insurer Ageas, which involves a series of cash payments to the British business. In February last year, it also held talks with Open, an Australian company, about a sale of the division but the discussions fell apart. Saga has previously signalled that it would explore a similar partnership model for its cruises division, although a transaction is not thought to be imminent. Shares in Saga have fallen by just over 20% during the last 12 months, leaving it with a market capitalisation of about £165m.

Title: Czech National Bank Plans Multi-Billion Euro Bitcoin Purchase

The governor of the Czech National Bank reportedly wants to invest in bitcoin. The move — involving billions of euros worth of the country’s reserves — could make this the first central bank in a Western nation to hold cryptocurrency assets, the Financial Times (FT) reported Wednesday (Jan. 29). Governor Aleš Michl said in an interview with the FT that he would present the bank’s board with the idea of investing in bitcoin as a way of diversifying the CNB’s reserves at a Thursday (Jan. 30) meeting. If the board agrees, the bank could someday hold up to 5% of its 140 billion euros of reserves in bitcoin, said Michl. Although he acknowledged bitcoin’s “extreme volatility” and limited record, Michl stressed growing investor interest in bitcoin since BlackRock and other companies launched bitcoin exchange traded funds (ETFs) in 2024. He also noted President Donald Trump’s push to deregulate the crypto sector and the administration’s embrace of the industry. Trump last week issued an executive order that established a working group to study the creation of a national digital asset stockpile. “For the diversification of our assets, bitcoin seems good,” Michl told the FT. “Those [Trump] guys can now kind of create some bubble for bitcoin, but I think the trend would be an increase without those guys as well, because it’s an alternative [investment] for more people.” The report points out that central banks have typically placed reserves in more conservative assets — U.S. Treasuries, bonds, equities — though none have publicly adopted crypto. Michl said he had “a totally different philosophy” about bitcoin compared to other central bank heads. “Of course, if you compare my position with other bankers, then I’m the one entering the jungle, or the pioneer,” Michl said. “I used to run an investment fund, so I’m a typical investment banker I would say, I like profitability.” While other central banks may be more reluctant to keep their reserves in bitcoin, they are — as covered here earlier this week — experimenting more frequently with blockchain and tokenization. At the most recent Eurogroup meeting, the European Central Bank (ECB) offered an update on its exploration on tokenization and blockchain’s role in streamlining the wholesale settlement of transactions. The bank reported that the technology is capable of solving inefficiencies, reducing risks, and unlocking new opportunities within wholesale trade. “This maturation of the cross-border landscape could ultimately redefine how growth-focused treasurers and CFOs manage global transactions, liquidity and risk,” PYMNTS wrote. We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

Czech National Bank (CNB) Governor Aleš Michl will present a proposal this Thursday that could see up to $7 billion of the country's wealth flow into crypto, potentially making it the first Western central bank to hold digital assets. "For the diversification of our assets, Bitcoin seems good," Michl said in an interview with the Financial Times, acknowledging his stance differs from other central bankers when it comes to crypto matters. The proposal follows increased institutional interest in Bitcoin after BlackRock and other firms launched spot ETFs. Michl also cited U.S. President Donald Trump's crypto-friendly stance and the growing influence of digital asset executives in his administration. This is not the first time that the country has made crypto headlines. In December, its parliament unanimously passed legislation exempting Bitcoin held over three years from capital gains tax. Earlier this month, Michl was quoted as saying that he had "considered" adopting Bitcoin as a foreign exchange reserve. Broader policy moves in the Eurozone are also shaping up in the background. No capital gains tax on bitcoin has just been passed in The Czech Republic with all members of the parliament voting for it 🇨🇿🔥 pic.twitter.com/i7E8aZHC2W — Kristian Csepcsar (@KristianCsep) December 6, 2024 Last week, the European Central Bank signaled its readiness for multiple rate cuts in 2025, with ECB President Christine Lagarde indicating a "gradual" approach toward monetary easing, according to reports from Reuters and CNBC out of Davos. Policymakers across Europe are slated to approve the cuts on January 30. The CNB has indeed carved out a niche in central banking with its investment strategies. Explaining its unique approach, Michl explained how the CNB's allocations are different from other central banks. Currently, the CNB allocates 22% of its portfolio to equities—primarily set on U.S. tech stocks like Apple and Microsoft. This is more than what most other central banks allocate, as they typically play it safe with government bonds. They're planning to ramp this up to 30% by 2029, betting on stocks to boost returns, Michl shared in the interview. Meanwhile, most central banks remain skeptical of crypto investments. The U.S. Federal Reserve confirmed in December it holds no Bitcoin, while European Central Bank officials maintained in February last year that the "fair value" of Bitcoin is "still zero," reacting to the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs a month prior. Given these, Michl acknowledged potential risks, noting Bitcoin could end up worthless or achieve "absolutely fantastic value." Michl said the move is aimed at diversifying reserves rather than just speculating. “My goal is to diversify the portfolio, so if Bitcoin is good, then let’s have it,” he said. The bank did not immediately return Decrypt's request for comment. Edited by Stacy Elliott.

Title: Czech central bank chief proposes huge Bitcoin investment – FT
URL: https://www.rt.com/business/611846-czech-central-bank-bitcoin-investment/
Time Published: 2025-01-29T14:55:43Z
Full Content:
The governor of the Czech National Bank (CNB), Ales Michl, wants to invest a substantial amount of the country’s reserves in Bitcoin, the Financial Times reported on Wednesday. The value of the world’s most popular cryptocurrency hit a new record earlier this month following the inauguration of crypto-friendly US President Donald Trump. Michl told the FT that he will present a proposal to the CNB’s board on Thursday, to invest up to 5% of the central bank’s €140 billion ($145 billion) reserves in crypto. “For the diversification of our assets, Bitcoin seems good,” Michl told the publication. The FT has described the potential move as “groundbreaking” and noted that the CNB could become the first Western central bank to hold crypto assets. “Those [Trump] guys can now kind of create some bubble for Bitcoin, but I think the trend would be an increase without those guys as well, because it’s an alternative [investment] for more people,” Michl added. The banker also acknowledged the asset’s volatility, saying he was “ready” for a possible Bitcoin collapse. Central banks traditionally hold their reserves in conservative assets such as US Treasuries and other forms of high-yield debt. Some have holdings in stocks, but almost none have publicly ventured into cryptocurrencies, the FT noted. Bitcoin hit a new record high this month after Trump was sworn in, surpassing $109,000. Days into his term, the new US president signed an executive order establishing a working group to explore the creation of a national digital asset stockpile. Last year, the value of Bitcoin more than doubled, thanks partially to the approval of trading of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded product (ETP) shares by a US regulator. According to Michl, more central banks could follow his lead within the next five years, as several funds and commercial banks have started investing in crypto. Larry Fink, CEO of investment company BlackRock suggested recently that if institutions allocate between 2% and 5% of their portfolios to Bitcoin, its price could reach $700,000. Introduced in 2009, Bitcoin enables peer-to-peer transactions over the internet without the need for traditional banking systems. Its decentralized nature appeals to those seeking alternatives to government-backed currencies. However, this same feature has allegedly made it attractive for illicit activities, including money laundering and terrorist financing. Bitcoin’s value is influenced by factors such as supply and demand dynamics, market availability, competition from other cryptocurrencies, and investor sentiment. Despite its growing use in commerce, Bitcoin operates in a regulatory gray area, with no uniform international laws governing its use. El Salvador adopted Bitcoin as an official currency in 2021, although many governments remain cautious, warning about the risks associated with investing in such a volatile asset.

The bitcoin price dropped sharply toward $100,000 before bouncing back to around $102,000 though bitcoin and crypto remain subdued despite BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink revealing a sovereign wealth fund bombshell. Now, as Coinbase's chief executive predicts when the bitcoin price could flip gold's $18 trillion, bitcoin and crypto traders are braced for the Federal Reserve's latest interest rate decision after U.S. president Donald Trump called for rates to come down sharply. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run U.S. president Donald Trump has called for Federal Reserve chair to lower interest rates by "a ... [+] lot"—something that many think would boost the bitcoin price and crypto market. The market is pricing in a near-100% certainty that the Fed's rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will keep interest rates on hold, according to the CME Group FedWatch Tool, after cutting rates at each of its last three meetings. "The current [bitcoin price] lull can be attributed to risk aversion ahead of the Fed meeting," Alex Kuptsikevich, the FxPro chief market analyst, said in an emailed note. 01/30 update: The bitcoin price and wider crypto market have climbed after the Federal Reserve followed through with its well-telegraphed pause of interest rate cuts yesterday, with the bitcoin price topping $105,000. Fed chair Jerome Powell's dovish comments that indicated he expects inflation to continue to ease helped push bitcoin and crypto prices higher. "Even with the U.S. Federal Reserve pursuing a ‘wait and see’ strategy on further interest rate cuts, bitcoin bulls have little reason to worry," Neil Roarty, cryptocurrency analyst at ClickOut Media, said in emailed comments. "The current 4.25% to 4.5% range is already proving low enough to sustain risk appetite, even if inflation is still higher than the Fed’s target. Bitcoin looks safe above the $100,000 watermark, and it could break higher over the coming months if Donald Trump pressures Jerome Powell into accelerating cuts, as he’s hinted he may. While bitcoin remains an attractive risk-on asset at current rates, a drop below 3% could flood markets with liquidity, further fueling speculation and pushing bitcoin into uncharted territory." Powell also opened the door for banks to start serving crypto companies, provided they take proper precautions. "Banks are perfectly able to serve crypto customers as long as they can understand and service the risks," Powell said at a press conference following the Fed's rate decision. Meanwhile, U.S. president Donald Trump criticized the Fed and Powell, accusing them of failing to get a handle on inflation and the economy and putting pressure on Powell to bring interest rates down through 2025. "Because Jay Powell and the Fed failed to stop the problem they created with inflation, I will do it by unleashing American energy production, slashing regulation, rebalancing international trade, and reigniting American manufacturing, but I will do much more than stopping inflation, I will make our country financially, and otherwise, powerful again," Trump posted to his Truth Social account. "The Fed has done a terrible job on bank regulation. Treasury is going to lead the effort to cut unnecessary regulation, and will unleash lending for all American people and businesses. If the Fed had spent less time on DEI, gender ideology, 'green' energy, and fake climate change, inflation would never have been a problem. Instead, we suffered from the worst inflation in the history of our country." The rate decision will be released Wednesday at 2pm ET, followed by the all-important press conference led by Fed chair Jerome Powell in which reporters will press him for a reaction to Trump's comments that interest rates should come down by "a lot." "I think I know interest rates much better than they do, and I think I know them certainly much better than the one who’s primarily in charge of making that decision," Trump said last week. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has surged over the last year, helped by the Federal Reserve beginning its ... [+] interest rate cutting cycle. Last year, then-Republican candidate Trump said U.S. presidents should have a say over decisions made by the Fed, raising the possibility it could lose its independence. "We expect [Fed chair Powell] to be as diplomatic as is possible, while firmly committing to Fed independence," Ajay Rajadhyaksha, an economist at Barclays, wrote in a note seen by Axios. "Now that Trump has been calling quite vocally for lower interest rates, if the Fed eases monetary policy it will create the impression that they caved to him and forfeited their independence," Isabella Weber, economist at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, told the Financial Times.

Thank you everyone. It’s fantastic to be here at Siemens at this amazing facility. Today, I want to talk about economic growth. Why it matters. How we achieve it. And what we are going to do further and faster to deliver it. Before we came into office… … the Prime Minister and I have said loud and clear: Economic growth is the number one mission of this government. Without growth, we cannot cut hospital waiting lists or put more police on the streets. Without growth, we cannot meet our climate goals… … or give the next generation the opportunities that they need to thrive. But most of all… … without economic growth… … we cannot improve the lives of ordinary working people. Because growth isn’t simply about lines on a graph. It’s about the pounds in people’s pockets. The vibrancy of our high streets. And the thriving businesses that create wealth, jobs and new opportunities for us, for our children, and grandchildren. We will have succeeded in our mission when working people are better off. I know that the cost of living crisis is still very real for many families across Britain. The sky high inflation and interest rates of the past few years have left a deep mark… … with too many people still making sacrifices to pay the bills and to pay their mortgages. But we have begun to turn this around. Everything I see as I travel around the country gives me more belief in Britain. And more optimism about our future. Because we as a country have huge potential. A country of strong communities, with small and local businesses at their heart. We are at the forefront of some of the most exciting developments in the world… … like artificial intelligence and life sciences… … with great companies like DeepMind, AstraZeneca, Rolls Royce… and of course Siemens… … delivering jobs and investment across Britain. We have fundamental strengths – in our history, in our language, and in our legal system – to compete in a global economy. But for too long, that potential has been held back. For too long, we have accepted low expectations and accepted decline. We no longer have to do that. We can do so much better. Low growth is not our destiny. But growth will not come without a fight. Without a government willing to take the right decisions now to change our country’s future for the better. That’s what our Plan for Change is all about. That is what drives me as Chancellor. In my Mais lecture in March last year, I set out my approach to achieving economic growth… … and identified the fundamental barriers to realising our full potential. The productive capacity of the UK economy has become far too weak. Productivity, the driver of living standards… …has grown more slowly here than in countries like Germany and the US. The supply side of our economy has suffered due to chronic underinvestment… … and stifling and unpredictable regulation… … not helped by the shocks we have faced in recent years. [redacted political content] The strategy that I have consistently set out… … is to grow the supply-side of our economy… … recognising that first and foremost… … it is businesses, investors and entrepreneurs who drive economic growth… … a government that systematically removes the barriers that they face – one by one and has their back This strategy has three essential elements: First, stability in our politics, our public finances and our economy - the basic condition for secure economic growth. Second, reform - reform which makes it easier for businesses to trade, to raise finance and to build. And third, investment, the lifeblood of economic growth. Let me explain each of those in turn. Stability – the first line of our manifesto was a promise to bring stability to the public finances. It is the rock upon which everything else is built. And it is the essential foundation of our Plan for Change. Because economic stability is the precondition for economic growth. That’s why the first piece of legislation that we passed as a government was the Budget Responsibility Act… … so never again will we see our independent forecaster sidelined. [redacted political content] At my first Budget in October… … it was my duty as Chancellor… … to fix the foundations of our economy, and repair the public finances that we inherited. To restore stability and create the conditions for growth and investment. I set out new fiscal rules which are non-negotiable, and will always be met. We began to rebuild our NHS and our schools – the start of a programme of public service reform. I capped the rate of corporation tax - and I extended our generous capital allowances for the duration of this parliament - as the CBI and the BCC have long called for. And I protected working people after a cost of living crisis… … by freezing fuel duty… … and with no increases in their National Insurance, Income Tax or VAT. But taking the right decisions and the responsible decisions does not always mean taking the easy decisions. The increase in Employers’ National Insurance contributions has consequences on business and beyond. I said that up front in my Budget speech. I accept that there are costs to responsibility. But the costs of irresponsibility would have been far higher. Those who oppose my Budget know that too. That is why, since October, I have seen no alternative put forward [redacted political content]. No alternatives to deal with the challenges we face. No alternatives to restoring economic stability… … and therefore no plan for driving economic growth. Alongside stability, we need to drive forward the reform which makes investment more likely… … by removing the constraints on the supply side of our economy… … making it easier for businesses to trade… … to raise finance… … and to build. Let me first address our approach to trade. We stand at a moment of global change. In that context, we should be guided by one clear principle above all. To act in the national interest… … for our economy… … for our businesses… … and for the British people. That means building on our special relationship with the United States under President Trump. The Prime Minister discussed the vital importance of growth with the President last weekend… … and I look forward to working with the new Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent… … to deepen our economic relationship in the months and the years ahead. Acting in our national interest also means resetting our relationship with the EU – our nearest and our largest trading partner – to drive growth and support business. We are pragmatic about the challenges that we have inherited from the last government’s failed Brexit deal. But we are also ambitious in our goals. [redacted political content] … we will prioritise proposals that are consistent with our manifesto commitments… … and which contribute to British growth and British prosperity… … because that is what the national interest demands. Our approach to trade also means building stronger relationships with fast-growing economies all around the world. That is why I led a delegation to China for the first Economic and Financial Dialogue since 2019… … alongside world-leading financial service businesses, including HSBC, Standard Chartered and Schroders… … unlocking £600 million of tangible benefits for the UK economy. And I am pleased to confirm that the Business and Trade Secretary will shortly visit India … … to restart talks on the free trade agreement and bilateral investment treaty [redacted political content]. Our businesses can only realise these opportunities if they can recruit the skilled staff that they need. So we are reforming our employment system to create a national jobs and careers service. We have created Skills England to meet the skills of the next decade in sectors like construction and engineering. And we will deliver fundamental reform of our welfare system. That includes looking at areas that have been ducked for too long… … like the rising cost of health and disability benefits… … and the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions will set out our plans to address this ahead of the Spring Statement. Next, the Immigration White Paper, that will bring forward concrete proposals to bring the overall levels of net migration down. But we know that the UK is in an international competition for talent in vital growth sectors. That is why last week, I set out plans for attracting global talent. We will look at the visa routes for very highly skilled people… … so the best people in the world choose the UK to live, work and create wealth… … bringing jobs and investment to Britain. To help businesses access the finance and support they need to grow… … we have delivered significant reforms to provide greater flexibility for firms and founders to raise finance on UK capital markets, by rewriting the UK’s listing rules. In my Mansion House speech, I announced a series of reforms to our pensions system… … including the creation of larger, consolidated funds… … which have much greater capacity to invest in high growth British companies at the scale that we need them to. The consultation on these reforms is already complete and the final report will be published in the Spring. Yesterday we confirmed that we have plans to go further, whilst always protecting the important role that pension funds play in the gilt market. We will introduce new flexibilities for well-funded Defined Benefit schemes… … to release surplus funds where it is safe to do so… … generating even more investment into some of our fastest growing industries. I know too that businesses are held back by a complex and unpredictable regulatory system… … and that is a drag on investment and innovation. We have already provided new growth-focused remits to our financial services regulators… … we have announced a new interim Chair of the Competition and Markets Authority… … and we have established the Regulatory Innovation Office, with an initial focus on synthetic biology, space, AI, and connected and autonomous vehicles. But we need to go further and we need to go faster. So earlier this month, I met the Heads of some of our largest regulators. They have already provided a range of options to drive growth in their sectors… … and proposals for how they can be more agile and responsive to businesses… … and we will publish that final action plan in March to make regulation work much better for our economy. To get Britain building again… … we have delivered the most significant reforms to our planning system in a generation. I have been genuinely shocked about how slow our planning system is. By how long it takes to get things done. Take the decision to build a solar farm in Cambridgeshire – a decision the Energy Secretary took only a few weeks into the job in July… [redacted political content] The Deputy Prime Minister has already driven significant progress across government in addressing these issues. My colleagues have determined 13 major planning decisions in just six months… … including for airports, data centres and major housing developments. We have significantly raised housing targets across our country and made them mandatory, so that we can build one-and-a-half million homes in this parliament. We have reformed decades-old “green belt” policies, making it easier to build on the “grey belt” land around our major cities. And we have opened up our planning system to build new infrastructure – like onshore wind farms or data centres driving the AI revolution. Having listened closely to calls from business groups like the Institute of Directors… … and businesses across our economy about the need to speed up infrastructure delivery… … including Mace, Skanska and Arup who are here today… … and members of our British Infrastructure Taskforce like Lloyds, Blackrock and Phoenix… … we have now set out plans to go even further. Last week we confirmed our priorities for the Planning and Infrastructure Bill … … to rapidly streamline the process for determining applications… … to make the consultation process far less burdensome… … and to fundamentally reform our approach to environmental regulation. The problems in our economy… … the lack of bold reform that we have seen over decades… … can be summed up by a £100 million bat tunnel built for HS2… … the type of decision that has made delivering major infrastructure in our country far too expensive and far too slow. So we are reducing the environmental requirements placed on developers when they pay into the nature restoration fund that we have created… …so they can focus on getting things built, and stop worrying about bats and newts. And to build our new infrastructure like nuclear power plants, trainlines and windfarms more quickly… … we are changing the rules to stop blockers getting in the way of development… … through excessive use of Judicial Review. This Bill, the Planning and Infrastructure Bill, is a priority for this government. It will be introduced in the Spring… … and we will work tirelessly in parliament to ensure its smooth, and speedy and rapid delivery. By providing a foundation of economic stability… … and by delivering the reforms needed to make it easier for businesses to succeed and grow… … we will create the right conditions to increase investment in our economy – the final key element of our strategy. Investment and innovation go hand in hand. I want to see the sounds and the sights of the future arriving. Delivered by amazing businesses like Wayve and Oxford Nanopore. They are the future. And Britain should be the best place in the world to be an entrepreneur. That is why we protected funding for research and development… … and it is why one of the first decisions I made as Chancellor… … was to extend the Enterprise Investment Scheme and the Venture Capital Trust schemes for a further 10 years… … to get more investment into new companies, driving their innovation and growth. I am determined to make Britain the best place in the world to invest. That was my message in Davos last week. That ambition demands action. The International Investment Summit that we hosted in October delivered £63 billion of investment right across our country… … from Iberdrola doubling its investment in clean energy in places like Suffolk… … Blackstone investing £10 billion in a data centre in Northumberland… … and Eren Holdings investing £1 billion in advanced manufacturing in North Wales. While the lifeblood of growth is business investment, a strategic state has a crucial role to play. That is why we established the National Wealth Fund… … to create that partnership between business, private investors and government to invest in the industries of the future… … like clean energy. Today I can announce two further investments by the National Wealth Fund. First, a £65 million investment for Connected Kerb, to expand their electric vehicle charging network across the UK. And second, a £28 million equity investment in Cornish Metals… … providing the raw materials to be used in solar panels, wind turbines and electric vehicles… … supporting growth and jobs in the South-West of England. There is no trade-off between economic growth and net zero. Quite the opposite. Net zero is the industrial opportunity of the 21st century, and Britain must lead the way. That is why we will publish a refreshed Carbon Budget Delivery Plan later this year, which alongside the Spending Review, will set out our plans to deliver Carbon Budget 6. Today, I can also announce that we are removing barriers to deliver 16 gigawatts of offshore wind… … by designating new Marine Protected Areas to enable the development of this technology in areas like East Anglia and Yorkshire… … crowding in up to £30 billion of investment in homegrown clean power. And there’s more. Our industrial and manufacturing base, brilliantly represented by Make UK, have been banging their heads against the wall for years at the lack of a proper industrial strategy from government. That is why we have launched our modern industrial strategy… … to drive investment into the industries that will define our success in the years ahead. We have already provided funding to unlock investment in sectors like aerospace, automotives and life sciences… … and we have set out reforms to boost financial services, the AI sector and creative industries. We are not wasting any time, and we will move forward with the next stages of the Industrial Strategy ahead of its publication in the Spring. We will work with the private sector to deliver the infrastructure that our country desperately needs. This includes the Lower Thames Crossing, which will improve connectivity at Port of Tilbury and Dover, London Gateway and Medway… … alleviating severe congestion… … as goods destined for export come from the North, and the Midlands and across the country to markets overseas. To drive growth and deliver value for money for taxpayers, we are exploring options to privately finance this important project. And we have changed course on public investment, too… … with a new Investment Rule to ensure that we don’t just count the costs of investment – we count the benefits too. We are now investing 2.6% of GDP on average over the next five years, compared to 1.9% planned by the previous government.. … delivering an additional £100 billion of growth-enhancing capital spending… … which catalyses private sector investment… … in more housing… … better transport links… … and clean energy. These are significant steps in just six months… … and we are seeing some encouraging signs in the British economy. The IMF have upgraded our growth prospects for 2025… … the only G7 country outside the US to see this happen. This gives us the fastest growth of any major European economy this year. And a global survey of CEOs by PWC, has shown Britain is now the second most attractive country in the world for businesses looking to invest. The first time the UK has been in that position for 28 years. This is all welcome news. But there is still more that we can and will do. I am not satisfied with the position we are in. While we have huge amounts of potential, the structural problems in our economy run deep. And the low growth of the last 14 years cannot just be turned around overnight. This has to be our focus for the duration of the parliament. Because the situation demands us to do more. And today I will go further and faster in kickstarting economic growth. Our mission to grow our economy is about raising living standards in every single part of the United Kingdom. Manchester is home to the UK’s fastest growing tech sector. Leeds is one of the largest financial services centres outside of London. These great northern cities have so much potential and promise… …which our brilliant metro mayors, Andy Burnham and Tracy Brabin, are working hard to realise… … just like our other metro mayors are doing to deliver new opportunities in their areas. And there is so much more that government can do to support our city regions. To achieve this requires greater focus on two key areas: infrastructure and investment. If we can improve connectivity between towns and cities across the North of England, we can unlock their true growth potential… … by making it easier for people to live, travel and work across the area. At the Budget, I set out funding for the Transpennine Route Upgrade… … a multi-billion-pound programme of improvements that will connect towns and cities from Manchester to York via Stalybridge, Leeds and Huddersfield. We are delivering railway schemes to improve journeys for people across the North… … including upgrades at Bradford Forster Square and by electrifying the Wigan-Bolton line. We have committed to supporting the delivery of a new mass transit system in West Yorkshire. And in Spring, we will publish the Spending Review and a 10-Year Infrastructure Strategy… … which will set out further detail of our plans for infrastructure right across the UK. New transport infrastructure can also act as a catalyst for new housing. We have already seen the benefits that unlocking untapped land around stations can deliver in places like Stockport… … where joint work spearheaded by Andy Burnham and council leaders has delivered new housing and wider commercial opportunities. We will introduce a new approach to planning decisions on land around stations, changing the default answer to yes. We are working with the devolved governments to ensure the benefits of growth can be felt across Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland… … including by partnering with them on the Industrial Strategy to support their considerable sectoral strengths. And in December, I met with Metro Mayors from across England. They told me that more opportunities for investment are vital if their local economies are to grow in the years ahead. We are listening closely to them. As the Metro Mayor of Liverpool, Steve Rotherham, has called for… … we will review the Green Book and how it is being used to provide objective, transparent advice on public investment across the country, including outside London and the Southeast. This means that investment in all regions is given a fair hearing by the Treasury that I lead. The Office for Investment is going to be working hand in hand with local areas… … to develop a commercially attractive pipeline of investment opportunities for a global audience… … starting with the Liverpool City Region and the North East Combined Authority, led by Kim McGuinness. The National Wealth Fund is establishing strategic partnerships to provide deeper, more focused support for city regions, starting in Glasgow, West Yorkshire, the West Midlands, and Greater Manchester. We are supporting key investment opportunities across the UK. The government is backing Andy Burnham’s plans for the redevelopment of Old Trafford, which promises to create new housing and commercial development around a new stadium… … to drive regeneration and growth in the area. We are moving forward with the Wrexham and Flintshire Investment Zone… … focusing on the area’s strengths in advanced manufacturing… … backed by major businesses like Airbus and JCB… … to leverage £1 billion of private investment in the next ten years… … creating up to 6,000 jobs. [redacted political content] So I can announce today that we will work with Doncaster Council and the Mayor of South Yorkshire, Oliver Coppard… … to support their efforts to recreate South Yorkshire Airport City as a thriving regional airport. And finally, I am pleased to announce a partnership between Prologis and Manchester Airport Group in the East Midlands, where the Metro Mayor Claire Ward is doing an excellent job growing the local economy there. Prologis and MAG will work together to build a new advanced manufacturing and logistics park at East Midlands Airport … … unlocking up to £1 billion of investment and 2,000 jobs at the site… … a major investment from a global business into our country… … representing a huge vote of confidence in the East Midlands and in the UK. This is just the start of our work to get more investment into every nation and region of Britain. Next, I want to set out further detail for plans for the area we are in today. Oxford and Cambridge offer huge potential for our nation’s growth prospects. Only 66 miles apart… … these cities are home to two of the best universities in the world… … and the area is a hub for globally renowned science and technology firms. This area has the potential to be Europe’s Silicon Valley. To make that a reality, we need a systematic approach to attract businesses to come here and to grow here. At the moment, it takes over two and a half hours to travel between Oxford and Cambridge by train. There is no way to commute directly by rail from places like Bedford and Milton Keynes to Cambridge. And there is a lack of affordable housing right across the region. In other words, the demand is there… … but there are far too many supply side constraints on economic growth here. We are going to fix that. The Ox Cam arc was initially launched in 2003 – over 20 years ago. [redacted political content] We are not prepared to miss out on the opportunities here any longer. So working with the Deputy Prime Minister… … who is already driving forward vital work in the region… … we are going further and faster to unlock the potential of the Oxford-Cambridge Growth Corridor. First, we are funding the transport links needed to make the Oxford Cambridge growth corridor a success… … including East-West Rail, with new services between Oxford and Milton Keynes starting this year… … and road upgrades to reduce journey times between Milton Keynes and Cambridge. East West Rail will also support vibrant new and expanded communities along the route. We have already received proposals for New Towns along the new railway… … with 18 submissions for sizeable new developments. At Tempsford – the nexus of the East Coast Mainline, the A1 and East West Rail… …we will move quicker to deliver a mainline station, meaning journey times to London of under an hour… … and to Cambridge in under 30 minutes when East West Rail is operational. Second, we are ensuring that the area has the right infrastructure and public services in place to support the growth corridor as it expands. A new Cambridge Cancer Research Hospital is being prioritised for investment as part of wave 1 of the New Hospital Programme. Water infrastructure has also been a major hindrance to development. So we have now agreed water resources management plans, unlocking £7.9 billion of investment in the next 5 years… …including plans for the new Fens Reservoir serving Cambridge and the South East Strategic Reservoir near Oxford. And I can confirm today that the Environment Agency have now lifted their objections to new development in Cambridge, following this government’s intervention to address water scarcity… … which means 4,500 additional homes, new schools, and new office, retail and laboratory space can be built. Third, I am delighted that Cambridge University have come forward with plans for a new flagship innovation hub at the centre of Cambridge… … to attract global investment and foster a community that catalyses innovation, as other cities around the world like Boston and Paris have done. Just yesterday, Moderna completed the build for their new vaccine production and R&D site in Harwell, right here in Oxfordshire, alongside a commitment to invest a further £1 billion in the UK. And we are creating a new AI Growth Zone in Culham to speed up planning approvals for the rapid build-out of data centres. And finally, to take this project forward at real pace… … and catalyse private sector investment into the region… … I am pleased to announce that the Deputy Prime Minister and I have asked Lord Patrick Vallance to be the champion for the Oxford Cambridge Growth Corridor. Lord Vallance has extensive experience across the sciences, academia, and government. He will work with local leaders and with the Housing and Planning Minister to deliver this exciting project… … including with Peter Freeman, who is already doing excellent work in Cambridge… … and a new Growth Commission for Oxford, which will help to accelerate growth in the city and its surrounding area. This is the government’s modern Industrial Strategy in action. With central government, local leaders and business working together… … the Oxford and Cambridge Growth Corridor could add up to £78 billion to the UK economy by 2035 … … driving investment, innovation and growth. Finally, I come to the decision that perhaps more than any other… … has been delayed… … has been avoided… … has been ducked. The question of whether to give Heathrow … … our only hub airport… … a third runway… … has run on for decades. The last full length runway in Britain was built in the 1940s. No progress in eighty years. Why is this so damaging? It’s because Heathrow is at the heart of the UK’s openness as a country. It connects us to emerging markets all over the world, opening up new opportunities for growth. Around three-quarters of all long-haul flights in the UK go from Heathrow. Over 60% of UK air freight comes through Heathrow. And about 15 million business travellers used Heathrow in 2023. But for decades, its growth has been constrained. Successive studies have shown that this really matters for our economy. According to the most recent study from Frontier Economics, a third runway could increase potential GDP by 0.43% by 2050. Over half – 60% of that boost, would go to areas outside London and the South-East. … increasing trade opportunities for products like Scotch whiskey and Scottish salmon - already two of the biggest British exports out of Heathrow. And a third runway could create over 100,000 jobs. For international investors, persistent delays have cast doubt about our seriousness towards improving our economic prospects. Business groups, like the CBI, the Federation of Small Businesses and the Chambers of Commerce right across the UK… …as well trade unions like GMB and Unite are clear… … a third runway is badly needed. In 2018, the previous government steered its Airports National Policy Statement through parliament. But no action was taken. It simply sat on the shelf. We are taking a totally different approach to airport expansion. This Government has already given its support to expansion at City Airport and at Stansted. And there are two live decisions on Luton and Gatwick which will be made by the Transport Secretary shortly. But as our only hub airport, Heathrow is in a unique position - and we cannot duck the decision any longer. I have always been clear that a third runway at Heathrow would unlock further growth… … boost investment… … increase exports… … and make the UK more open and more connected. And now, the case is stronger than ever… … because our reforms to the economy… … like speeding up the planning system… … and our plans for modernised UK airspace… … mean the delivery of this project is set up for success. So I can confirm today that this Government supports a third runway at Heathrow… … and is inviting proposals to be brought forward by the summer. We will then take forward a full assessment through the Airport National Policy Statement. That will ensure that the project is value for money - and our clear expectation is that any associated surface transport costs will be financed through private funding. And it will ensure that a third runway is delivered in line with our legal, environmental and climate obligations. Heathrow themselves are clear that their proposal for expansion will meet strict rules on noise, air quality and carbon emissions. And we are already making great strides in transitioning to cleaner and greener aviation. Sustainable Aviation Fuel reduces CO2 emissions compared to fossil fuel by around 70%. At the start of this month, the Sustainable Aviation Fuel mandate became law. And today I can announce that we are investing £63 million into the Advanced Fuels Fund over the next year… … and we have today set out the details of how we will deliver a Revenue Certainty Mechanism to encourage investment into this growing industry. These measures will encourage more investors to back production in the UK, bringing good, high-skilled jobs to areas like Teesside… … demonstrating that investment in the right technology can help us deliver both our growth and our clean energy missions. Now is the moment to grasp the opportunity in front of us. By backing a third runway at Heathrow, we can make Britain the world’s best connected place to do business. That is what it takes to make bold decisions in the national interest. That is what I mean by going further and faster to kickstart economic growth. The work of change has begun. We have already made great progress. But I am not satisfied. And I know that there is more to be done. We must go further and faster if we are to build a brighter future. The prize on offer is immense. The next generation with more opportunities than the last. An engineer in Teesside, working in some of the most exciting industries of the future – from carbon capture to sustainable aviation fuel. A scientist in Milton Keynes or Bedford, working in our life sciences industry to solve some of the most important medical challenges in the world. A small business owner in Scotland, knowing that they can expand and export to new markets right across the globe. Wealth created, and wealth shared, in every part of Britain. This is a Government on the side of working people. Taking the right decisions to secure their future, to secure our future. Stepping up to the challenges we face. Ending the era of low expectations. Putting Britain on a different path. Delivering for the British people. And I am determined, this Government is determined, to do just that. Thank you.

Title: Uber-backed mobility fintech Moove acquires Brazil’s Kovi, takes ARR to $275M | TechCrunch

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Uber-backed Moove, an Africa-born mobility fintech that offers vehicle financing to ride-hailing and delivery app drivers across six continents, has acquired Kovi, a Brazilian urban mobility provider. The value of the deal is not being disclosed, but Moove confirmed it was an all-share transaction, and Kovi is now wholly owned by Moove. Moove co-founder and co-CEO Ladi Delano told TechCrunch that the deal bumps the mobility fintech’s annual revenue to $275 million. Last March, Moove reported a $115 million ARR. The news comes two months after Moove announced a partnership with Waymo to provide driverless vehicle fleet operations in two U.S. cities, Phoenix and Miami. Delano said Moove’s acquisition of the São Paulo-based Kovi marks a significant step toward the company’s goal of building the world’s largest rideshare fleet. What began with 76 cars in Lagos, Nigeria, in 2020 has now grown to 36,000 cars operating in 19 cities across six continents, with Latin America now emerging as a key market. Similarly, the acquisition unites two companies tackling the same challenge — providing financing solutions for rideshare drivers. Founded in 2018, Y Combinator-backed Kovi launched to make vehicle ownership more accessible in Brazil. Following the acquisition, pending approval from the Brazilian antitrust authority, Kovi will continue to operate under its brand while its executive and management teams will remain unchanged. While Moove will keep the Kovi brand operating in its existing markets, Brazil and Mexico, there are plans to expand further across Latin America. Moove recently launched operations in three cities across Colombia and Mexico. As such, the acquisition further cements Moove’s position in Latin America, giving the company a major foothold in Brazil, the region’s largest ride-hail market. “We’re incredibly excited about working with a fantastic team of like-minded individuals at Kovi who set up this business to address a similar problem that we found in Nigeria,” he remarked. “Kovi is one of the top two players in Brazil. So we have not just entered or strengthened our presence in the Latin American market but also put ourselves in a top-two position in the largest single market in Latin America through this acquisition.” Moove has built a third pillar in the global mobility marketplace by offering vehicle supply to ride-hailing platforms. This includes its flagship Drive-to-Own product, a taxi and employment model, and an emerging autonomous vehicle (AV) business line involving AI-driven mobility. While AI plays a key role in its AV business line, Delano says the company’s AI mobility strategy will span the entire business, from optimizing traditional ride-hailing services to improving fleet management, according to Delano. This is where the Kovi acquisition comes in. According to the chief executive, Kovi’s proprietary technology and algorithms will “complement and strengthen our existing Moove AI mobility strategy and ensure that we can start to deliver an improved service and product to our customers around the world.” It’s unclear whether Kovi was struggling financially before its acquisition by Moove. Its last known funding round was a $104 million Series B in 2021 from investors like Valor Capital, Prosus Ventures, and Quona Capital. Despite raising funds to expand across Latin America, Kovi primarily focused on Brazil. That year, it reported $45 million in ARR, growing 15% month-over-month. The all-share transaction makes Kovi’s investors shareholders in Moove, aligning their growth trajectories. In a statement, Kovi CEO Adhemar Milani Neto expressed confidence in the deal. “I met the founders [Moove’s Delano and Jide Odunsi] many years back when they were scaling their business in Africa, and I was immediately impressed by their purpose-driven approach, which is also a perfect match to our culture. Together, I believe we will become a truly global category-defining business and will leverage scale and deep expertise never seen in our market.” Moove raised a $100 million Uber-led Series B last year at a $750 million valuation. The mobility fintech has secured over $500 million in debt and equity from backers like Mubadala, BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, Janus Henderson, and the IFC (World Bank) since its launch five years ago. Delano declined to comment on potential new fundraising efforts. Instead, he stressed that the company will focus on driving its capex-heavy business to profitability this year and realizing its vision of building the largest ride-hailing fleet globally.

Title: Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK): Is This Healthcare Stock A Good Buy?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Retirement Stock Portfolio: 10 Healthcare Stocks to Buy. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) stands against the other healthcare stocks. Healthcare stocks are widely considered a cornerstone of a retirement portfolio due to their resilience, long-term growth potential, and ability to provide steady income through dividends. This sector encompasses pharmaceutical companies, healthcare providers, biotechnology firms, and medical device manufacturers, all of which are positioned to benefit from enduring trends like aging populations and advancements in medical technology. One of the most compelling reasons to include health stocks in a retirement portfolio is their defensive nature. Health care is a necessity, not a luxury, meaning demand for medical products and services remains steady, even during economic downturns. According to a report by Morningstar, the healthcare sector outperformed the broader market in 75% of US recessions over the past 50 years, demonstrating its ability to provide stability when other sectors falter. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. Global demographic trends also favor health stocks. The United Nations projects that the number of people aged 65 and older will double by 2050, reaching 1.5 billion. This aging population will drive increased demand for chronic disease management, prescription medications, and long-term care services. The US alone spends over $4.3 trillion annually on health care, according to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, accounting for nearly 20% of GDP. This figure is expected to rise to $6.8 trillion by 2030, driven by advances in medical technology and higher spending on aging-related health issues. Health stocks, particularly those of established pharmaceutical companies, often provide attractive dividend yields, making them ideal for income-focused retirees. Drug giants are known for consistently paying and increasing dividends. Dividends provide retirees with regular income, reducing the need to sell assets during market downturns. The healthcare sector is also at the forefront of technological innovation, offering exposure to high-growth areas such as biotechnology, precision medicine, and artificial intelligence in healthcare. Healthcare stocks provide diversification in a retirement portfolio as well, balancing out more volatile sectors like technology or energy. Additionally, healthcare ETFs like the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund offer exposure to a wide range of companies, spreading risk while capturing growth potential. For example, Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund has delivered a 10-year annualized return of 13.4%, outperforming many other sectors. Read more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities. For this article, we selected health stocks that have solid businesses with recurring revenue streams, reliable dividend payouts, and burgeoning growth pipelines. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A close-up of a person's hand holding a bottle of pharmaceuticals. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 86 Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) operates as a healthcare company worldwide. There are several aspects that make this company an attractive investment choice. Merck & Co. (NYSE:MRK) has achieved 14 consecutive years of dividend growth, surpassing the sector median of 2 years by 600%.

Title: Nasdaq Files for In-Kind Redemptions for BlackRock Spot Bitcoin ETF

EditorCrypto CoinDesk, Helene Braun, Krisztian Sandor The Securities and Exchange Commission had previously only allowed cash redemptions when the spot bitcoin ETFs were approved last January. Nasdaq has filed a proposed rule change to allow in-kind creation and redemption for the BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), according to a Friday filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The process allows large institutional investors, called authorized participants (APs), to buy and redeem shares of the fund directly to bitcoin (BTC). It is considered to be more efficient as it allows APs closely monitor the demand for the ETF and to act fast by buying or selling shares of the fund without cash being involved in the process. Retail investors are not eligible to participate. When the SEC first approved spot bitcoin ETFs including IBIT last January, the agency allowed to launch the funds with cash redemption, instead of bitcoin. “It should have been approved in the first place but Gensler/Crenshaw didn’t want to allow it for a whole host of reasons they gave,” Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst James Seyffart wrote on X. “Mainly [they] didn’t want brokers touching actual Bitcoin.” BlackRock’s IBIT is the largest spot BTC ETF on the market, attracting nearly $40 billion of inflows in its first year, making it the most successful ETF debut ever.

Three events, including a $500k investment, signal that a parallel WordPress community is gaining momentum Three recent events may signal the direction in which the WordPress community is evolving and have the feel of pieces falling into place. What’s happening isn’t a change in the WordPress community itself but the emergence of a parallel one. There is movement to build a parallel community and infrastructure to WordPress. The goal is to bring stability to WordPress and ensure that it continues to be the world’s most popular content management system. Recent events related to the Automattic and Mullenweg dispute with WP Engine have given rise to actions that may in time wrest control of WordPress away from Automattic and Matt Mullenweg. This second approach of creating an alternative WordPress community gained major support from GoDaddy in the form of a half million dollar donation to the non-profit The WP Community Collective, a group whose goal is to support an independent WordPress open source ecosystem. GoDaddy explained: “GoDaddy …just invested a half-million dollars in the WordPress community through a donation to The WP Community Collective, an initiative focused on funding and empowering WordPress contributors. This monetary support will be directed towards providing financial, operational and promotional support within the greater WordPress community. The WP Community Collective contribution by GoDaddy… aims to strengthen open source communities by providing resources for designers, developers and other contributors who make the internet work.” What makes the GoDaddy funding interesting is that one of the investors in GoDaddy, BlackRock, is also an investor in Automattic. BlackRock recently lowered the value of their stake in Automattic, which is said to currently be less than one percent. The second piece of the alternative WordPress community is in the form of an investment made by Joost de Valk in an actual WordPress business community that was founded 15 years ago. Joost is turning it into a non-profit and setting it up with a governance board. According to the announcement: “…we’re excited about this community and the history that has brought Post Status to where it is – a true staple of the WordPress community where thoughts flow freely, business is done, and mutual support is abundant. …Over the past few months, it’s become very clear that Post Status is an enormously important place for the community to come together and discuss all things WordPress. A place with light moderation, but also with true freedom of speech (within the boundaries of treating everyone with respect) and the freedom to have different opinions. We want to enshrine those freedoms even more. That’s why we (Marieke and myself) will be buying Post Status” Joost de Valk, the founder of Yoast SEO plugins, has recently become an outspoken advocate of changing WordPress governance to a more democratic model and of creating a parallel WordPress structure that secures and stabilizes the distribution of WordPress themes and plugins. There have been ongoing discussions across the WordPress community about decentralizing plugin and theme distribution so that WordPress.org, which is controlled by Automattic and Matt Mullenweg, is no longer the sole source. Decentralization would remove that control by distributing software through multiple channels. Karim Marucchi (LinkedIn profile), well known in the WordPress community as a leader in enterprise WordPress development, wrote about securing the supply chain in reference to making the availability of plugin and themes secure and trustworthy. He wrote: “Securing the Supply Chain & Start Modernization The first step is to act on what Joost called Federated And Independent Repositories. It is absolutely imperative that we show the world that we have supply chain security. To create a community Plugin, we should immediately form a collaboration group between independent contributors, multiple hosting companies, agencies, and the broader product community within our ecosystems. Designed from day one to prevent any business or entity from disrupting the supply chain” Joost de Valk recently wrote about the importance of a federated repository: “We need to supplement WordPress.org updates with other sources, so that what happened to Advanced Custom Fields, can’t happen again. Lots of hosts are currently experimenting with or already putting in place mirrors of WordPress.org. This creates issues: download and active install statistics are no longer reliable, for instance. Just having mirrors of WordPress.org also doesn’t really solve the problem of a single party controlling our single update server. For that, we need to make sure that those mirrors federate with each other, and share each others data and, as Karim suggested, allow for independent plugins and themes to be hosted there, outside of the wordpress.org repository. I call this: Federated and Independent Repositories, in short: FAIR. I’m already talking to several hosts about this, and would welcome anyone who wants to join these conversations, so we’re not duplicating work.” There is now a project called AspirePress that aims to decentralize WordPress which has been gathering momentum. AspirePress intends to become a mirror repository and eventually become a decentralized distributed model, which is expressed in their motto at the top of every page: “Decentralize. Distribute. Democratize.” AspirePress is committed to being a truly open source WordPress community project: “AspirePress is a community-driven open-source project aimed at providing resources and tools to improve the lives of WordPress developers everywhere. We are focused on building a package mirror to freely distribute plugins and themes to WordPress users, no matter who or where they are.” AspirePress is an example of people in the WordPress community taking steps to decentralize WordPress so that one entity can’t unilaterally take over someone else’s plugin and replace it with their own as Automattic and Matt Mullenweg did to WP Engine’s highly popular ACF plugin which was completely replaced with a renamed version controlled by Automattic. Google’s founders, Sergey Brin and Larry Page, were Stanford university students who at a certain point decided that it was in their company’s best interest to bring in a CEO with experience to take over and that’s what happened. Google’s founders still remained involved in the company but CEO seat was filled by someone else who was trustworthy. Google’s one of the largest and most influential companies in the world and is an example of founders who successfully relinquished control to more experienced hands. So it’s not like there is no precedent of a company founder who successfully handed control to someone else in order to grow the company. There are other examples in the open source community as well: These examples of successful transitions in for-profit and open-source organizations demonstrate that change in leadership and control can lead to growth. The three developments discussed in this article reflect the gradual shifts occurring in WordPress, a platform that supports thousands of jobs and generates billions in revenue worldwide. Stakeholders invested in WordPress’s stability may see these developments as steps toward that goal.

Governor Michl advocates Bitcoin as a diversification tool amid increasing institutional adoption across the world. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Czech National Bank (CNB) Governor Aleš Michl will reportedly propose adding Bitcoin to the country’s reserve assets, Financial Times reported on Jan. 29. If approved, his plan would see the bank eventually allocate as much as 5% of its $146.13 billion reserves to Bitcoin, moving beyond its traditional gold and US dollar holdings. Earlier this month, he hinted at potential adjustments to the bank’s reserve strategy, suggesting a broader approach to asset allocation. Bitwise’s European Head of Research, André Dragosch, said the proposed investment could amount to $7.3 billion in Bitcoin. This would place CNB’s BTC reserves above its $4.3 billion gold holdings and account for roughly 5.3 months of newly mined Bitcoin. Dragosch said: “Czech central bank holds around 146 billion USD in official reserve assets of which 138 billion USD are FX reserves and 4.3 billion USD are gold. They plan to invest up to 5% of these reserves into BTC (approximately 7.3 billion USD / ~71,568 BTC).” CNB’s Michl sees Bitcoin as a diversification tool amid rising institutional adoption. He pointed to growing interest in crypto-related investment products, particularly after asset managers like BlackRock launched BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs). He also noted shifting US policies, including President Donald Trump‘s deregulation efforts and increased engagement between crypto firms and policymakers. Under the Trump administration, the US has adopted a more friendly disposition to the emerging industry and recently signed an executive order designed to make America a leader in the sector. Michl said: “For the diversification of our assets, Bitcoin seems good…Those [Trump] guys can now kind of create some bubble for bitcoin, but I think the trend would be an increase without those guys as well, because it’s an alternative [investment] for more people.” Although Bitcoin remains volatile, Michl believes its rising adoption justifies its inclusion in national reserves. He acknowledged the risks but emphasized the CNB’s experience in managing fluctuating assets. “It’s possible to have a big range of outcomes, that bitcoin will have a value of zero or an absolutely fantastic value . . . but in our history we have also had some stocks like Enron or the payment company Wirecard, so we have some experience with bad investments, so, yes, I’m ready [for a possible Bitcoin collapse],” he said.
