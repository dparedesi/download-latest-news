The dividends paid in March are nearly double the previous all-time high of $2.1 million, registered in July 2024. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate.

BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) distributed $4.17 million in dividends during March, marking the largest monthly payout for a tokenized Treasury fund. According to a report by BUIDL’s issuer, Securitize, the record-setting distribution brings BUIDL’s cumulative dividend payments to $25.4 million since its inception, reflecting increasing institutional interest in on-chain exposure to traditional financial products. Additionally, Securitize noted that the March record is roughly 2x larger than the previous $2.1 million peak registered in July 2024. The fund, which tokenizes a money market strategy comprised of US Treasuries and cash equivalents, provides daily dividend payouts Monday through Friday, giving investors near real-time yield accruals directly on-chain. Tokenized US Treasury funds are emerging as a foundational layer in on-chain finance. By providing verifiable, yield-bearing backing, they offer alternatives to crypto-native stablecoins. The sector is the second-largest in tokenization, with nearly $5 billion in size. BUIDL’s assets under management (AUM) reached an all-time high of $1.93 billion on March 27, less than a month after crossing the $1 billion threshold. According to data from rwa.xyz, its rapid growth places it among the largest real-world asset (RWA) products on public blockchains, trailing only four stablecoins in market capitalization. A key driver of BUIDL’s AUM expansion is Ethena Labs’ synthetic dollar, USDtb, which uses the fund for 90% of its backing. As of the latest figures shared by Ethena Labs, USDtb has $1.29 billion in exposure to BUIDL, accounting for 67% of the fund’s total market value. USDtb, designed to maintain price stability through a delta-neutral strategy, allocates reserve capital into BUIDL to earn yield from US Treasury exposure. This structure has made BUIDL a critical component in Ethena’s stablecoin design, directly linking traditional fixed-income instruments to crypto-native applications. Notably, MakerDAO’s Spark will hold a vote on April 3 to decide whether the protocol should follow its plan to invest $500 million in BUIDL. This would boost the fund’s market size even further, making participation in investments by DeFi protocols represent 74% of current numbers. BUIDL has been expanding its offering to various blockchains. After its launch on Ethereum, the fund expanded to Arbitrum, Polygon, Optimism, Avalanche, Aptos, and Solana more recently. This multi-chain deployment is part of Securitize’s strategy to make institutional-grade financial products natively accessible across decentralized environments, facilitating integrations with protocols and wallets across ecosystems. Yet, $1.72 billion of BUIDL shares are issued on Ethereum’s blockchain, nearly 90% of the fund’s size.

Title: Plaid’s $575 Million Round Signals Strength Despite Valuation Drop and Delayed IPO

Finovate is part of the Informa Connect Division of Informa PLC This site is operated by a business or businesses owned by Informa PLC and all copyright resides with them. Informa PLC's registered office is 5 Howick Place, London SW1P 1WG. Registered in England and Wales. Number 8860726. Tracking fintech, banking & financial services innovations since 1994 Financial data network Plaid announced it has brought in $575 million in a round led by new investor Franklin Templeton, with existing investors NEA and Ribbit Capital, as well as new investors BlackRock and Fidelity, also contributing. The Venture Round is a sale of common stock; Plaid has directly issued the new shares to raise capital. In a company blog post announcement, Plaid CEO and Co-Founder Zach Perret said that the funds will be used “to address employee tax withholding obligations related to the conversion of expiring restricted stock units (RSUs) to shares, and to offer some liquidity to our current team.” While today’s funds increase Plaid’s total funding to $1.3 billion, the round revealed a decreased valuation for the California-based fintech. Once valued at $13.4 billion during fintech’s brief hype days of 2021, Plaid’s valuation is currently less than half that, at $6.1 billion. In explaining the significant gap in valuation to the Financial Times, Perret said, “In 2025, tech multiples have massively compressed between the time that we raised last and today. What I will say is that the fundamentals of the business underneath are dramatically stronger than they were in 2021. Revenue is much higher.” Plaid’s $575 million comes at a time of growth for the company. Not only did the fintech expand its product suite, but it also saw an increase in organizations building with its account connection tools. In 2024, Plaid boasted positive operating margins, saw a revenue increase of more than 25%, and experienced an increase in both the number companies and markets it serves. As a result, more than 1 in 2 Americans have used Plaid. ​If you are wondering when Plaid plans to IPO, you’re not alone. A company spokesperson told TechCrunch that Plaid will not go public this year, but it plans to continue tracking towards a public listing. “An IPO is certainly a part of the longer-term plan. We have not attached a specific timeline to it,” Perret told the Financial Times. “As I’ve said in the past, it will not be this year.” Plaid’s decision to hold off on an IPO may also be a strategic move given the evolving state of open banking in the US. Unlike regions such as the UK and EU, where open banking is well-established and governed by clear regulatory frameworks such as PSD2, the US market remains in flux. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) is currently working toward finalizing its proposed Personal Financial Data Rights rule under Section 1033 of the Dodd-Frank Act, but the lack of formalized standards has created uncertainty for data aggregators like Plaid. By delaying its public debut, Plaid may be seeking to ride out regulatory headwinds and position itself on more solid ground once clearer guidelines are in place. In addition to regulatory clarity, Plaid may also benefit from a recognition and understanding from mainstream consumers, many of whom have never heard the term “open banking.” Once regulations go into effect, banks will slowly begin in educate consumers on the benefits of open banking, and the concept of the value that Plaid brings will come to light. This regulatory clarity, combined with consumer understanding, could improve investor confidence and support a stronger valuation when the company ultimately decides to go public.

Title: BlackRock chief sees risk of brief recession in US amid Trump tariffs
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2025/04/03/blackrock-chief-sees-risk-of-brief-recession-in-us-amid-trump-tariffs/
Time Published: 2025-04-03T16:59:31Z
Full Content:
Larry Fink, chief executive of BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, said the US faces the risk of tipping into a brief recession in the coming months, after its president, Donald Trump, unleashed a range of tariffs on the world this week. However, he said in an interview with The Irish Times in Dublin on Thursday that the new administration’s policy of cutting government costs and red tape would boost growth over the longer term. The possibility of a downturn in the US is “not insignificant” in the next few months, said Mr Fink, who has led the growth of BlackRock into an institution with $11.6 trillion (€10.5 trillion) of assets under management since he co-founded it in 1988. “At the same time, as the president’s policies kick in in relation to deregulation and streamlining permitting [for various projects], we could see a real growth agenda that offsets some of the recessionary short-term pressures,” he added. The US president outlined on Wednesday a raft of tariffs being phased in over the next week, including a baseline charge of 10 per cent on imports, rising to 20 per cent for the EU, 30 per cent on China and 46 per cent on Vietnam. Stock market indices across Asia, Europe and Wall Street fell on Thursday – wiping $1.7 trillion off the value of companies listed on the S&P 500 index by midday in the US alone – as investors digested the sweeping tariff announcements and potential for retaliation. Gold, seen as a safe haven in times of turbulence, reached a fresh record of almost $3,168 an ounce. US government bond yields – or market interest rates – also fell as investors bet the US Federal Reserve will accelerate interest rate cuts this year to prop up the economy. Yields on European government bonds also dipped. Mr Fink said a US trade war with Europe and other trading partners does not need to follow, as Mr Trump is merely seeking to reciprocate part of what other countries are imposing on imports from the US. He added that Europe must work now to become more competitive. “There does not need to be a true trade war,” he said. “The question is: is there any validity to what the US is doing and saying? Should we have more symmetry in our trading agreements? That’s all. That’s what the reasoning is.” When asked if he agreed with Mr Trump’s approach, he answered: “It’s not for me to agree. But I understand the logic behind it.” Mr Trump said that the new tariffs were “approximately half” of what its trading partners “have been charging us”. That halved figure includes “the combined rate of all their tariffs, non-monetary barriers and other forms of cheating,” he added. Ireland’s pharmaceutical sector which accounts for 60 per cent of exports from the State to the US, has so far avoided the new EU duty. However, Tánaiste Simon Harris said in the Dáil on Thursday that “we shouldn’t fool ourselves that there aren’t further plans in relation to sector specific measures, including pharma”. The EU is “preparing for further countermeasures” to protect its interest, but focused, for now, on trying to negotiate with the Trump administration, European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said. Taoiseach Micheál Martin said Ireland said: “It is important that our response is considered and measured. Any action should be proportionate, aimed at defending the interests of our businesses, workers and citizens.” “A confrontation is in no one’s interests,” he added.

Title: Could Panama Throw a New Wrench Into BlackRock’s Ports Deal?

Essential news coupled with the finest maritime content sourced from across the globe. Join the leading maritime news network Photo: Matt Ragen/Shutterstock April 3 (Reuters) – BlackRock could hit another roadblock in its attempt to secure control of two flagship ports near the Panama Canal once the Central American country releases an audit on a 25-year concession granted to Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison. Final signature of the deal in Panama, part of a broader $22.8 billion transaction between a BlackRock-led group and CK Hutchison including over 40 ports in 23 countries, is expected to be delayed as criticism grows in China, sources told Reuters last week. The deal’s definitive documentation was initially expected to be signed by April 2, BlackRock and CK Hutchison said last month when they announced the deal. As China’s market regulator begins an antitrust review on the deal, Panama’s government is requesting documents from CK Hutchison, a telecoms-to-retail conglomerate owned by tycoon Li Ka-shing, to complete an audit on the concession. Panama’s Maritime Authority also asked BlackRock and CK Hutchison to provide details of their deal, which must ultimately be green-lit by Panama. The deal includes 90% of the Panama Ports Company, which operates the Balboa and Cristobal ports at either end of the Panama Canal. The Panama ports audit was announced in January by the Comptroller General office as “the most important” of a series of reviews of key infrastructure concessions in Panama. Comptroller general Anel Flores said last week that results are expected in the coming ‘days or weeks.’ Flores has criticized previous audits, including one completed before CK Hutchison’s concession was renewed in 2021, saying they were limited to confirming the fulfillment of operational goals. “We’ll begin a severe, strong audit of those books and company,” he said earlier this year. Flores has also complained about the ‘poor yield’ of the contract for Panama and the slow delivery of documents requested from CK Hutchison. In February, Panama’s Attorney General released a binding opinion finding that the port contract was unconstitutional. Panama’s Supreme Court will have the last word on that. If the Comptroller General finds irregularities in the concession renewal or the Supreme Court declares the contract to be unconstitutional, the concession could be revoked, complicating the BlackRock-CK Hutchison deal and possibly creating grounds for international arbitration, lawyers and experts have said. U.S. President Donald Trump has celebrated the BlackRock-CK Hutchison deal, while China and pro-Beijing voices have criticized it, thrusting the firms involved and the Panamanian ports into the fray of the U.S.-China trade war. However, any hurdles to the deal increase the risk of a hardening of Trump’s policy towards the canal. Since taking office in January, Trump has escalated his threats of controlling places he says could better serve U.S. interests, like the Panama Canal and Greenland. The ports are not part of the canal. However, American officials and politicians have said CK Hutchison’s control of them, along with other concessions to Chinese firms in Panama, represents a security risk for the canal’s operation. CK Hutchison has said the sale of the ports was purely commercial and unrelated to politics. Panama says the canal is operating in a fair and secure way, granting equal access to vessels from all origins. Pro-Beijing media have published a series of commentaries criticizing CK Hutchison’s deal, depicting it as a betrayal of China and a “perfect cooperation” with the U.S. strategy to contain China. The pressure on CK Hutchison has deepened concerns that Hong Kong’s edge as a financial hub will erode further amid geopolitical tensions. The purchase is in line with BlackRock’s recent investment drive in infrastructure, and it secures the fund manager a strong position near an essential global trade hub. The broader deal including many other ports worldwide could give BlackRock control of 10.4% of global container throughput, making it the world’s third largest port operator, Chinese state media reported. The deal has also been described as helping BlackRock and CEO Larry Fink win political capital with Republicans, who in some states have restricted or banned BlackRock from managing retirement or treasury funds over the company’s policies on environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) investing. Some Republicans were reconsidering BlackRock bans after Trump praised the deal.

Title: Everything You Need To Know About Muni Bonds Right Now

ByBrett Owens ByBrett Owens, Contributor. Tax credit abstract concept vector illustration. Save money, calculate balance, government support, ... More business profit, income report, budget planning, bank card, savings refund abstract metaphor. The economy is slowing. And if you believe that these tariff-tapping brakes are going to land us in a recession, these muni bonds (with tax-equivalent yields up to 12.4%) are for you. This is the time to recession-proof our retirement holdings. The new administration appears to want to get a slowdown “out of the way” early. Atlanta’s GDPNow forecast says the economy is already shrinking: Fed GDPNow Forecast Meanwhile the latest University of Michigan consumer sentiment report shows that confidence is falling fast. The index dropped to 57.9 in March—its lowest level since November 2022. Back then we were emerging from a sharp and painful 10-month bear market. Are we slipping into the bears’ claws again? If so, municipal bonds are an attractive income play. “Don’t fight Bessent” is the new cry from investors as Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent bets the house on lower long-term interest rates. Munis traditionally rise as long rates fall, a common feature of recessions. Plus, munis offer big tax breaks. Let’s start with tax-free federal income options. Vanilla investors reach for iShares National Muni Bond ETF (MUB) and its 4.4% tax-advantaged yield. For high earners this is the equivalent of a 7% pre-tax dividend. Not bad. But we know better than to settle for a popular ETF. Closed-end funds tend to provide higher yields and discounts to boot. Our Contrarian Income Report favorite Nuveen AMT-Free Quality Municipal Income Fund (NEA), for example, yields 7.4% before tax breaks. For top earners, this equates to a tax-equivalent dividend up to 12.4%. NEA also trades at a 5% discount to its net asset value (NAV). Which means we can buy its portfolio of munis for 95 cents on the dollar. This discount window is a feature (not a bug!) of CEFs, which have fixed pools of shares and often trade at discounts to their NAVs. Live in a high-tax state? There are state-specific muni funds, too. Here are 10 CEFs to consider: 10 State Muni Bonds California buyers of Nuveen California Quality Municipal Income Fund (NAC) are paying just 95 cents on the dollar for their state-specific munis. These bond distributions then get a pass from Uncle Sam and Governor Gavin Newsom for a tax-equivalent yield over 17%. Muni bonds also tend to be safe. With default rates around 0.1%, they are the most secure fixed income plays beyond US Treasuries (which are currently bulletproof, at least from a default standpoint, thanks to our global printing press and world reserve currency.) And state “rainy day funds”—financial reserves for slowdowns—have reached historically high levels, touching $164 billion recently. This cushion helps secure the creditworthiness of state-specific munis. From a price gains perspective, munis are no longer the slam dunks they were in late 2022. I was pounding the table then to buy for the yields and upside. Today, it’s more about the safety because the price upside from here is likely limited. Why the measured outlook? First, while long rates have come down, there may be a floor nearby due to persistent inflation. Inflation data continues to come in above the Fed’s stated long-term target. As I write, the 10-year Treasury trades for 4.3%. Inflation is running at 2.8%. The coupon seems fair, especially given the Treasury Secretary has $9 trillion in debt to refinance this year. Second, there are risks to the tax benefits. The Biden administration’s 2025 budget proposal included a potential impact on muni exemptions. Past proposals have suggested capping tax benefits for high-income earners, key customers for these bonds. BlackRock Taxable Municipal Bond Trust (BBN) is a “Goldilocks” muni play for those of you with concerns about the tax code changing against munis. BBN yields 6.7% and will see an inflow of cash if federal or state tax privileges come under pressure. Not only that, but also BBN can be had for 96 cents on the dollar, thanks to its 4% discount to NAV. How are we handling our munis at CIR? We added NEA in October 2022 when the bond market was bottoming. The fund remains a Buy, but a cautious one—we are keeping eye on the political and inflationary risks to this fund and our two other muni positions. A taxable alternative like BBN is a potential income pivot, if necessary. We contrarians will keep it in mind. In the meantime, enjoy these fat tax-equivalent yields and their discounts.

Title: Bitcoin At Risk Of Institutional Capture, Warns Jack Dorsey

In a “21 and 21” rapid-fire interview with Haley Berkoe at San Francisco’s Presidio Bitcoin workspace, Jack Dorsey—CEO of Block and former Twitter chief—cautioned that BTC’s growing popularity among major financial institutions could threaten the open ethos that gave rise to the world’s largest cryptocurrency. “It probably harms it a bit,” Dorsey said when asked about institutional investment in Bitcoin. Yet he acknowledged that large-scale involvement is practically inevitable, adding, “I think it’s obvious that we’ll see more of it, and I hope that more people take on the principles of what made Bitcoin successful in the first place.” Speaking on the emergence of institutional giants like BlackRock, Dorsey emphasized the permissionless nature of Bitcoin: “To be able to work on a money transmission protocol that’s entirely open […] that has converted the likes of a BlackRock or these major institutions that we railed against in the past—and now they have to turn their attention to it—and yet you still don’t need their permission to build on it […] where else can you find that?” Dorsey’s comments came during a conversation that spanned everything from his early interest in “the old cypherpunks” to the projects Block is building to strengthen the core infrastructure. He highlighted ongoing work on an “open source mining rig and chipset,” as well as Bitkey, a self-custodial wallet, and Block’s integration of BTC into Cash App. One of Dorsey’s main concerns is that Bitcoin might end up sidelined if it focuses too narrowly on serving as a store of value. “I think it fails through irreverence—like it just fails to be relevant to people on a daily basis,” he remarked. According to him, ensuring widespread use for payments is key to making BTC indispensable. “If it just ends up being store of value and nothing more, I don’t think it gains relevance at all. I think it has to be payments for it to be relevant on the everyday,” Dorsey said, warning that otherwise Bitcoin risks “just not showing up in people’s lives” and slipping into obscurity. A noted Bitcoin advocate, Dorsey nonetheless believes that focusing solely on the Lightning Network—a leading Layer 2 solution—could limit BTC’s evolution. “I think we can do better than Lightning,” he said, clarifying that while Lightning “isn’t bad,” it’s merely one option. “I don’t think we just want to settle with having one Layer 2,” he explained, emphasizing that Bitcoin benefits most from experimentation in payments and other applications. Dorsey consistently returned to the importance of open-source development, urging companies to fund Bitcoin Core and other community-driven projects without exerting control. “Having some sort of granting ability to open-source developers is important,” he said, praising initiatives such as Spiral—a BTC-focused division of Block—along with independent grant programs like Brink and OpenSats. He also mentioned the emerging role of artificial intelligence and its interplay with BTC, envisioning a future where agents could seamlessly transact on behalf of users. “It’s all about who you’re asking permission from,” he said. “Development goes faster if you have to ask for less permission.” The setting for the interview, Presidio Bitcoin, underscores Dorsey’s belief in bringing real-world communities together to foster deeper engagement. “I think this is great because it is a bridge between Silicon Valley and all the energy down there, and Bitcoin,” he noted, highlighting the need for physical spaces where ideas can germinate into tangible projects. From building more accessible wallets to reinforcing the permissionless nature of Bitcoin, Dorsey sees plenty of work ahead. When asked what single thought he would leave with newcomers, he insisted that nobody should rely on one person’s word—his included—before diving into the space: “Don’t listen to anyone’s single thought about Bitcoin,” he said. “What makes Bitcoin special is it’s permissionless. You don’t need anyone’s permission to build what you want to see.” At press time, BTC traded at $83,523. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: “This Is Existential”: Billionaire Cancer Researcher Says Covid & Vaccine Likely Causing Surge In Aggressive Cancers

Editor Health Tyler Durden, ZeroHedge Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong – a transplant surgeon-turned-biotech billionaire renowned for inventing the cancer drug Abraxane – has issued a startling warning in a new in-depth interview with Tucker Carlson. Soon-Shiong, founder of ImmunityBio ($IBRX) and owner of the Los Angeles Times, claims that the COVID-19 pandemic, and the very vaccines developed to fight it, may be contributing to a global surge in “terrifyingly aggressive” cancers. In the nearly two-hour conversation, the Los Angeles Times owner leveraged his decades of clinical and scientific experience to outline why he suspects an unprecedented cancer epidemic is unfolding. This report examines Dr. Soon-Shiong’s background and assertions, the scientific responses for and against his claims, new data on post-COVID health trends, and the far-reaching implications if his alarming hypothesis proves true. Soon-Shiong is a veteran surgeon and immunologist who has spent a career studying the human immune system’s fight against cancer. He pioneered novel immunotherapies and even worked on a T-cell based COVID vaccine booster during the pandemic. In the interview, he draws on this background to voice deep concern over rising cancer cases, especially among younger people – something he describes as a “non-infectious pandemic” of cancer. He tells Carlson that in 50 years of medical practice, it was extraordinarily rare to see cancers like pancreatic tumors in children or young adults, yet recently such cases are appearing. For instance, Soon-Shiong was alarmed by seeing a 13-year-old with metastatic pancreatic cancer, a scenario virtually unheard of in his prior experience. “I never saw pancreatic cancer in children… the greatest surprise to me was a 13-year-old with metastatic pancreatic cancer,” Soon-Shiong told Carlson, adding that he’s seen examples of very young patients (even children under 11 with colon cancer) and unusual surges in aggressive diseases like ovarian cancer in women in their 30s. These personal observations of more frequent, aggressive cancers in youth led him to probe what might have changed in recent years. “We’re clearly seeing an increase in certain types of cancer, like pancreatic cancer, ovarian cancer… colon cancer… in younger people.”— Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong According Soon-Shiong, the COVID era is the obvious change – and suggests that both the SARS-CoV-2 virus infection and the widespread vaccination campaigns could be key drivers behind this cancer spike. He emphasizes the massive scale of human exposure to the virus and its spike protein (via infection or vaccination). “I don’t know how to say that without saying it. It scares the pants off me because I think what we may be, I don’ think it’s virus versus man now, this is existential. I think when I talk about the largest non-infectious pandemic that we’re afraid of, this is it.” “Billions of people – literally billions – had the COVID virus. Over a billion got the spike protein vaccine,” said Carlson, adding “So that’s like, we’re talking like a huge percentage of the Earth’s population, unless I’m missing something.” “Now you understand what keeps you awake at night and kept me awake at night for two years, two and a half years,” Soon-Shiong replied, suggesting that exposure to both is silently undermining the immune system’s natural defenses against cancer on a global scale. Soon-Shiong frames COVID-era cancers as potentially virally triggered or exacerbated. In the interview, he described cases of “virally induced cancers” in clinics during the pandemic – patients whose cancers may have been kicked into overdrive by the cascade of inflammation and immune stress associated with COVID-19 (Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong: You’re Being Lied to About Cancer, How It’s Caused, and How to Stop It). COVID infection causes a massive inflammatory response, and some cancers are known to exploit inflammation to grow. TUCKER: “a lot people have pointed to both COVID, the virus, and to the mRNA COVID vaccines as potential causes. Do you think that they’re related?“ SOON-SHIONG: “The best way for me to answer that is to look at history. What we know about virally-induced cancers is well-established. We know that if you get hepatitis, you get liver cancer. Hepatitis is a virus infection. We know if you got human papillomavirus, HPV, you get cervical cancer.” We know that certain viruses directly cause cancer (e.g. HPV, Epstein-Barr), so it’s not unprecedented for a virus to play a role in oncogenesis. While SARS-CoV-2 is not a known oncovirus, Soon-Shiong worries its indirect effects – chronic inflammation, immune exhaustion, or “suppressor cells” that emerge in the wake of infection/vaccination – could be accelerating tumor development. “The answer is to stop the inflammation…clear the virus from the body,” he argues, positing that until we eradicate lingering virus and restore immune balance, we may see mounting cancer cases. In sum, Dr. Soon-Shiong’s claim is that the pandemic has set the stage for an explosion of aggressive cancers: the COVID virus itself (especially if it persists in survivors) might suppress immune surveillance, and the mRNA vaccines “that didn’t stop it” might inadvertently contribute to an immunosuppressive environment. These effects, in his theory, could be unleashing cancers that the immune system would ordinarily have kept in check. Watch: Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong is a surgeon who made billions inventing cancer drugs. He says that Covid, and the vaccines that didn’t stop it, are likely causing a global epidemic of terrifyingly aggressive cancers.(0:00) Why Are Cancer Rates Rising in Young People?(6:16) What Is… pic.twitter.com/5QO8AWLtXx A number of clinicians and researchers have reported similar worrying observations, though these remain largely anecdotal at this stage. One prominent voice echoing Soon-Shiong’s concern is Dr. Angus Dalgleish, a veteran oncologist and professor at St. George’s, University of London. In late 2022, Dalgleish wrote to the BMJ’s editor after noticing that some cancer patients who had been stable for years experienced “rapid progression of their disease after a COVID-19 booster.” He cited cases of individuals who were doing well until shortly after vaccination – new leukemias, sudden appearance of Stage IV lymphomas, and explosive metastases in patients who had post-vaccine bouts of feeling unwell. “I am experienced enough to know that these are not coincidental,” Dalgleish wrote, noting that colleagues in Germany, Australia and the U.S. were independently seeing the same pattern. This frontline testimony aligns with Soon-Shiong’s fear: something about the immune system post-vaccination might be removing restraints on latent cancers. Dalgleish specifically pointed to short-term innate immune suppression after mRNA vaccination (lasting for several weeks) as a plausible mechanism. Many of the cancers he saw were ones normally held in check by immune surveillance (melanomas and B-cell cancers), so a temporary post-vaccine drop in immune vigilance could allow a tumor growth spurt. He also alluded to “suppressor gene suppression by mRNA in laboratory experiments” – a reference to preliminary studies that found the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein might interfere with key DNA repair or tumor-suppressor proteins in cells. These lab findings (while not yet confirmed in living organisms) lend some biological plausibility to the idea that spike exposure could affect cancer-related pathways. Beyond individual doctors, some research is probing links between COVID and cancer behavior. For example, a 2022 study in Frontiers in Oncology explored how SARS-CoV-2 proteins interact with cancer cells. It found that the virus’s membrane (M) protein can “induce the mobility, proliferation and in vivo metastasis” of triple-negative breast cancer cells in the lab (Frontiers | SARS-CoV-2 M Protein Facilitates Malignant Transformation of Breast Cancer Cells). In co-culture experiments, breast cancer cells exposed to the viral protein essentially became more aggressive and invasive. The researchers concluded that COVID-19 infection “might promote…aggressive [cancer] phenotypes” and warned that cancer patients who get COVID could face worse outcomes. While this is one specific context (breast cancer cells and one viral protein), it underpins Soon-Shiong’s general concern: the virus can directly alter the tumor microenvironment to the cancer’s advantage. Another line of evidence involves latent viruses and inflammation. Doctors have documented unusual reactivations of viruses like Epstein-Barr (which is linked to lymphomas and other malignancies) during both COVID-19 and post-vaccine immune reactions. Such reactivations hint at a period of immune dysregulation that might also let nascent cancer cells slip past defenses. Or course,fact-checkers and medical authorities argue that there is no credible evidence of vaccines causing meaningful immune suppression. “There isn’t evidence to date that COVID-19 vaccines cause cancer or lead to worsening cancer,” one infectious disease expert told FactCheck.org, though they do acknowledge rare side effects like myocarditis or blood clots were found, but not cancer. While the scientific community debates mechanistic links between COVID and cancer, independent analysts have been parsing population-level data for unusual patterns. One notable effort is by Phinance Technologies, a research firm co-founded by former BlackRock portfolio manager Edward Dowd. Phinance has been analyzing excess mortality and disability data since the pandemic, looking for signals of broad health impacts in the aftermath of COVID and mass vaccination. Their findings reveal concerning trends, especially among younger, working-age populations, that lend some weight to Dr. Soon-Shiong’s general warning of a post-COVID health crisis (though not specific to cancer alone). Phinance’s “Vaccine Damage Project” examined the U.S. population aged 16–64 (essentially the workforce) and stratified outcomes into four groups: no effect, mild injuries, severe injuries (disabilities), and death. Using official government databases (the CDC, Bureau of Labor Statistics, etc.), they estimated how each category changed starting in 2021 – when vaccines rolled out and COVID became widespread. The results are sobering. According to Phinance’s analysis, by the end of 2022 the U.S. had experienced approximately 310,000 excess deaths among adults aged 25-64 (a ~23% increase in mortality in that group over normal expectations). Notably, they argue that after mid-2021, with vaccines available and the virus itself becoming less deadly (due to immunity and milder variants), COVID-19 should not have been causing such high excess death rates. Therefore, those 310k “unexplained” deaths in 2021–2022 could represent an upper bound on vaccine-related fatalities or other pandemic collateral damage. Even more striking is the data on new disabilities. Phinance found that from early 2021 through late 2022, about 1.36 million additional Americans (age 16–64) became disabled – a 24.6% rise in disability in that cohort, far above historical trend. This jump in disabilities among the workforce correlates in time with the vaccine rollout (and was disproportionately higher in the labor force than among those not working). The analysts note that the healthiest segment of the population (employed working-age adults) saw a greater relative increase in disabilities after Q1 2021 than the older or non-working groups. This is unusual, since typically health shocks hit the elderly hardest – but here something was impacting younger, healthy people to a significant degree. Phinance investigated further and found a tight relationship between the cumulative number of vaccine doses administered and the rise in disabilities in 2021-22. In fact, for the 16–64 population, they computed a ratio of about 4 new disabilities per excess death in that period, suggesting many survivors were left with lingering health issues even if they didn’t die.

It has been driven forward by two interconnected objectives. On the economic front, it seeks to extract hundreds of billions of dollars in tariff hikes, ultimately paid for by US companies and consumers, to shore up the ever-worsening trade and financial position of the US, while weakening its global economic rivals, particularly China, to improve its trade position. It also aims to enhance US military capacity by using tariffs to force companies, foreign and domestic, to increase the level of their operations on American soil, much of which is needed to supply the military. Under the new regime, the US will impose “reciprocal tariffs” on a range of countries. The tariff is not determined by the tariff actually charged on US exports. Rather, a number has been assigned to each of the countries involved. This includes not only the tariff charged on US exports, but all measures such as subsidies, regulations, bio-security measures for agricultural products, and the value of the currency, which the US considers to have the same effect as a tariff in discriminating against the US. The reciprocal tariff to be charged has been set at half that number. Thus, for China, a key target of the new regime, the number assigned to it by US economic officials is 67, and the reciprocal tariff will be 34 percent. This will be on top of the 20 percent tariff already imposed on Chinese goods, bringing the total tariff level to 54 percent. One of the immediate effects of the tariff hike, set to come into effect on April 9, will be a major price increase for a vast range of goods made in China and purchased by American consumers. The European Union, which Trump has denounced as an organisation set up to “screw” the US, has been assigned the number 39, and the tariff impost will be 20 percent. Southeast Asian countries—a number of which have become a center of manufacturing operations for many companies seeking to escape the effect of trade bans on China—will be hit even harder. The tariff for Thailand will be 36 percent, Malaysia 24 percent and Vietnam 46 percent. The tariff for South Korea, already hit by the 25 percent tariff on “foreign-made” cars, which came into effect at midnight, will be 25 percent. And the list goes on. All countries not hit with a “reciprocal tariff” will have a 10 percent tariff imposed on their exports, in a measure aimed, in part, at preventing companies from transferring some of their operations to countries not specifically targeted by the US. Now there is nowhere in the world they can go. Trump began his presentation of the new tariff regime in the White House Rose Garden with his now customary rant against the rest of the world. “For decades, our country has been looted, pillaged, raped, and plundered by nations near and far, both friend and foe alike,” he said, remarking later that in some cases friends had been worse than foes. “For years, hard-working American citizens were forced to sit on the sidelines as other nations got rich and powerful, much of it at our expense, but now it’s our turn to prosper.” However, the repeated claims by Trump that the tariff measures are going to produce a new golden age for the US are a fiction. They will not bring down inflation but raise prices on a vast range of goods. The auto tariffs are set to raise prices on cars from anywhere between $3,000 and $10,000. Thousands of jobs will be lost, and any new plants set up in the US will be highly automated, with a small labour force to cut costs. Furthermore, the so-called “American-made” is non-existent. Every car in the world, including in the US, is the product of a complex international division of labour. For example, the Ford F-150 pickup truck, one of the standard bearers for what is regarded as an “American” car, comprises thousands of parts imported from all over the world. Trump claims the new tariff regime is a magic cure-all that is going to both pay down US government debt and reduce the trade deficit. But estimates of the expected tariff revenue, according to Capital Economics, are that at most, it will bring in around $800 billion. The interest bill alone on the US debt, now at around $36 trillion and rising, is $1 trillion every year as it fast becomes the biggest item in the budget. The trade policies of the Trump administration are internally contradictory. On the one hand, it wants to expand US export markets by weakening the value of the US dollar, thereby making American goods cheaper in world markets. But maintenance of its reserve currency status, which Trump regards as an existential issue for the US—losing it, he has said, would be the equivalent of losing a war—depends on a strong dollar. Moreover, however much Trump harks back to President William McKinley and his tariff regime at the turn of the 20th century, the US economy has long outgrown its national borders and is dependent on an expanding global economy. But the global economy, already experiencing some of the lowest growth in decades, is now about to take another major blow. According to calculations published earlier this week in the Financial Times, the overall hit to the world economy could be in the order of $1.4 trillion if, as is virtually certain, there is retaliation. On top of this, there is growing nervousness in financial markets—already in a fragile condition because of the rise in global debt—both of governments and corporations. This was expressed in the letter by Larry Fink, the chief executive of BlackRock, the world’s largest asset management firm, to shareholders this week. He said, “protectionism has returned in force” and that in his conversations, people were “more anxious about the economy than at any time in recent memory.” Recent memory, it should be noted, includes the global financial crisis of 2008 and the financial crisis of March 2020, which saw the freezing of the US Treasury bond market. Trump is imposing the sweeping tariff regime under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977, passed under the Democratic Carter administration, which gives him the power to declare a national emergency if there is an “unusual and extraordinary” threat from outside the US that impacts national security, foreign policy or the economy. The so-called Fact Sheet issued by the White House said the national emergency was the result of the large and persistent trade deficit. It was $918 billion in 2024, an increase of 17 percent from the previous year. The White House statement made clear that military considerations are a central driving force of the new tariff regime. The “reciprocal tariffs” are directed against countries “with which the US has the largest trade deficits,” but virtually every time economic matters are raised in the document, they are linked with military issues. It said that “pernicious” economic policies and practices of trading partners undermined US ability to produce goods for the public “and the military, threatening national security.” “‘Made in America’,” it declared, “is not just a tagline—it’s an economic and national security priority of this administration.” US stockpiles of military goods were “too low to be compatible with national defense interests,” and developments in bio-manufacturing, batteries and microelectronics had to be made “to support defense needs.” Explaining the focus on non-tariff barriers, particularly with regard to China, it said they had not only undermined US competitiveness but threatened “US economic and national security by increasing our reliance on foreign-controlled supply chains for critical industries, as well as everyday goods.” The Fact Sheet outlined the central core of the economic war. “Today’s IEEPA Order,” it said, “also contains modification authority, allowing President Trump to increase the tariff if trading partners retaliate or decrease the tariffs if trading partners take significant steps to remedy non-reciprocal trade arrangements and align with the United States on economic and national security matters.” In other words, get in line or you will be hit—and even harder if you lift a finger. The tariff measures are not just a preparation for war—they are certainly that, and in earlier times could have been considered an act of war. Today, the lines between the states of war and peace are blurred, as the war on the economic front is tied directly to the expansionist drive of US imperialism—the threats to make Canada the 51st state, the ongoing operations to take over Greenland, and the increased bombing of the Houthis in Yemen, to name just a few. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article.

Plaid has raised $575 million in a secondary share sale that sees the open banking platform's valuation drop from $13.4 billion in 2021 to $6.1 billion. 1 03 April 2025 Be the first to comment This content has been selected, created and edited by the Finextra editorial team based upon its relevance and interest to our community. Ribbit Capital, NEA, Fidelity Management & Research Co, BlackRock, and Franklin Templeton joined the round, which will give some Plaid employees the chance to cash out restricted stock that expires at the end of 2025. Plaid CEO Zach Perret tells CNBC that the firm has seen "substantial" growth over the last year but that the valuation drop is part of wider market conditions. Says Perret: “The reality is our business is much stronger and revenue has grown quite substantially. The profitability of business has gotten quite a lot better, and yet we are impacted by market multiples, as many companies are.” He adds that while an IPO is still the plan, "we still have a lot of internal work to do. We're not ready, which is why we didn't consider it right now." Founded in 2012, Plaid helps consumers connect their financial accounts from over 12000 providers to more than 8000 fintech providers. The firm's 2021 $13.5 billion valuation came months after it was forced to abandon a $5.3 billion takeover by Visa after the US Justice Department moved to block the deal over competition concerns.

Title: Volatile Markets Drive Crypto Industry To Innovative Further

ByLawrence Wintermeyer ByLawrence Wintermeyer Contributor. Recession stock market financial chart on a trading board background. There are concerns about an impending recession in the United States, with JP Morgan raising its probability to 40 percent, up from 30 percent at the beginning of the year, and Goldman Sachs raising the probability to 20 percent. The “Trump bump” has waned with the U.S. stock markets down since the start of 2025, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq leading the sell off down nearly 8 percent. Following “liberation day” where President Trump announced new tariffs on U.S. imports, a new era of trade competition has markets selling off and many economists predicting a rise in U.S. inflation. The President, said he expected his plans on tariffs, at the highest level in more than a century, would create problems in the financial markets but usher in a “a booming economy.” Last month in relation to tariffs, the U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent called the market drop a “healthy correction.” Similarly, Kevin Hassett, head of the National Economic Council, said, “There are a lot of reasons to be extremely bullish about the economy going forward. But for sure, this quarter, there are some blips in the data.” Crypto markets, which are highly correlated to tech stocks, have shed over $1 trillion in the past weeks. Crypto veterans know volatility is a fundamental aspect of market dynamics. During transient market conditions, experienced crypto allocators and developers return to the trenches and focus on driving crypto innovation. Extended periods of market volatility often present opportunities for investing in and building new and better crypto products. The crypto economy beyond BTC and ETH can often lack a solid grounding as liquidity circulates from one narrative to another. Instead of generating revenue from businesses with strong fundamentals, shifting capital reserves can often obstruct the industry’s sustainable growth. The memecoin market has shrunk by over 57 percent, from $125 billion in December 2024 to $53 billion in March 2025. Investors’ primary activity has been rotating capital allocation as $485 million flowed out of Solana to Ethereum, Arbitrum, and BNB Chain in February 2025. Byron Gilliam, market strategist and uber-industry pundit at Blockworks says, “Memecoins are not stocks, of course, they’re lottery tickets — some of which do pay off.” Gilliam highlights the memecoin launchpad pump.fun has generated $600 million of revenue in its short 14-month existence and users don’t have much to show for it: Of the 8.7 million tokens launched, only four now have market caps above $100 million. The memecoin market is driven mainly by retail investors. The Dow Investing Versus Gambling chart lays out the continuum of expected returns to uncertainty that most serious financial professionals involved in allocating capital to and developing the crypto and digital asset ecosystem are at pains to point this out. Lotteries are the last stop on the uncertainty axis, following casino gambling. There is a strong argument that memecoins are not cryptoassets, per se. Investing Versus Gambling Roshan Dharia, CEO of Echo Base, a crypto holding company, has elaborated on the retail investor’s plight within the crypto domain saying, “No doubt Memecoins have been instrumental in onboarding the crypto-curious, however, to build a sustainable financial market, the crypto industry must stay focused on building products with real economic utility that solve real world problems. “Memecoins make for great press, but traditional financial institutions are focused on how crypto creates efficiency and transparency in a way that unlocks new value. That value has long been inaccessible but on blockchain rails... everything changes." Utility is an important aspect of attracting people to crypto and creating new revenue channels for on-chain companies. The other important aspect is ensuring safety for retail investors, especially after the $1.4 billion Bybit hack. According to a CertiK report, there were 760 security breaches with $2.36 billion lost in 2024, a sharp 31 percent year-on-year (YoY) rise. These vulnerabilities expose the risk of investors within the crypto industry and the need to build highly secure crypto products. CertiK co-founder and ceo, Professor Ronghui Gu commented, “Hackers are using increasingly sophisticated techniques, and it is now more important than ever for blockchain businesses and projects to proactively invest in robust security measures. The Bybit breach is a wake-up call for the entire industry. Security is not simply a competitive edge - it is a shared responsibility." Mooly Sagiv, CEO and co-founder of Certora, explained, “As the crypto industry matures, hackers will find more sophisticated ways to siphon off funds. The onus lies with companies to develop safer products for users. Incidents like the Bybit hack erode investor confidence, and stakeholders must take all necessary precautions to initiate a trust-building exercise.” As the speculative frenzy settles down for a while, companies have the window to focus on building safe crypto products with real use cases. VCs have been doing this for a long time and continue to do so during market volatility. NFTs and the metaverse didn’t feature among the popular crypto narratives of 2024 in any dimension including mindshare. They were remnants of the past crypto bull market cycle, forgotten amidst memecoins and the AI token frenzy. Yet, according to a Galaxy report, VCs invested the largest share of capital in categories like NFTs, metaverse, and gaming in Q4 2024. The reality is that people like to gamble, play the lottery, and enjoy gaming. These multi-billion dollar U.S. industries, $65 billion, $100 billion, and over $100 billion annually respectively, are growing (globally), and in many instances, and are being transformed by Web3 technologies. It is an important point to bring to attention, especially as it relates to technology innovation and investment where gaming is a leading category of VC investment. VCs often don’t follow a mindshare-based investing strategy. Instead, they identify categories with immense potential and invest early to reap dividends when the industry matures. For instance, in Q4 2024, the majority of capital for NFTs, DAOs, and metaverse went to early-stage companies and projects. According to Ronald Yung from RaveDAO, “NFTs were once perceived primarily as digital collectibles or icons of the last bull cycle, but their real value lies in their evolving utility. At RaveDAO, we’ve integrated NFTs beyond art—leveraging them for event ticketing as proof of attendance and participation. “While the market sentiment around NFTs has shifted, the underlying technology remains a powerful tool for authentication, access control, and community engagement. The solution itself isn’t going anywhere — it’s simply adapting to real-world applications.” Similarly, VCs had identified AI’s transformative potential long before ChatGPT became a household name, and AI tokens dominated investor mindshare. AI funding has grown steadily from just $670 million in 2011 to $36 billion in 2020. VC capital inflows into emerging tech remain strong. In Q1 2025, AI funding outpaced crypto venture funding by a huge margin, continuing a historically preferential investment trend. Although the traditional AI space attracts more funds, blockchain-based AI startups have also started getting capital investments recently. Rowan Stone, CEO of Sapien, said, “There’s still an enormous gap between legacy AI and crypto-AI investments, with institutional capital favoring the former, but bringing together two emerging categories, like crypto and AI to build frontier consumer-focused tech will likely drive more revenue growth and attract new investments. “There’s more we can accomplish to build a smart AI-driven global ecosystem if we continue to develop good products within the crypto-AI sub-domain.” The investment patterns show that VCs have identified more “future-proof” segments and deployed capital accordingly for long-term market growth. The Trump administration’s assurance that the American economy will experience a transitory period is a promise greatly supported by America’s leading Technology and Information sector. The Technology and Information sector is the third largest U.S. services sector and contributes around 10 percent of GDP (~$2.4 trillion), behind the second, Healthcare & Social Assistance – around 18 percent of GDP (~$4.5 trillion), and the number one services sector leader, Financial Services, which contributes around 20 percent of GDP (~$5 trillion) - the U.S. is the home of the global capital markets. The American market boom is anything but over for the Financial Services sector, according to Larry Fink, the chairman and ceo of Blackrock, in his Annual Report. In fact, it’s just getting started. Historically, markets in transition always presented enormous scope for innovation. The ongoing market transition also provides a good reminder to strive for innovation without getting distracted by daily stock market moves. Warren Buffet, arguably history’s most successful fundamental investor, advises us to, “Remember that the stock market is a manic depressive.” In a recent CNBC interview, he said "When valuations swing wildly, always focus on the underlying quality — opportunities abound in the chaos." Always stay rational.

ByBilly Bambrough ByBilly Bambrough, Senior Contributor. Bitcoin and crypto prices have dropped after U.S. president Donald Trump followed through with his threatened "Liberation Day" of global trade tariffs—dropping an “atomic bomb” on markets. The bitcoin price has fallen back after climbing in the run up to Trump’s tariff announcement as traders scramble to parse the so-called reciprocal tariffs (and stay ahead of a serious new threat). Now, as the chief executive of BlackRock warns bitcoin could end the U.S. dollar’s world’s reserve currency status, traders are betting the Federal Reserve will be forced to cut interest rates to stave off a U.S. recession—something that could see the market “flooded” with dollars. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell is having to recalculate the need for interest rate cuts after ... More U.S. president Donald Trump followed though on his threat of global trade tariffs—potentially playing havoc with the bitcoin price. Short-term interest-rate futures are showing a 70% chance of a Fed interest rate cut when it meets in June, up from about 60% before the tariffs were announced. Recession fears have seen traders have boost bets the Fed will restart its interest rate cutting cycle this summer and deliver a total of three quarter-point reductions to the policy rate by October, it was reported by Reuters. Trump’s so-called “Liberation Day” barrage of trade tariffs have pushed the probability of a U.S. recession to over 50% on prediction markets Polymarket and Kalshi. "Remember—tariffs are dovish, and big tariffs are very dovish," Joseph Wang, operator of the research portal Fedguy.com posted to X. In a closely-watched Wednesday announcement, Trump slapped 10% tariffs on most goods imported to the U.S., as well as even higher duties on dozens of countries. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has dropped as Donald Trump sparks fears of recession and the Federal Reserve ... More suspends its planned interest rate cutting cycle. Last September, the Fed’s surprise 50 basis point interest rate cut helped kick off the bitcoin price rally that fed into Donald Trump’s election victory in November. “I still believe bitcoin can hit $250,000 by year-end because now that the [U.S. Treasury secretary Scott Bessent] has put [Fed chair Jerome] Powell in his place, the Fed will flood the market with dollars,” Arthur Hayes, a cofounder of crypto derivatives pioneer BitMex, wrote in a blog post. “If my analysis of the Fed’s major pivot from quantitive tightening to quantitive easing for treasuries is correct, then bitcoin hit a local low of $76,500 last month, and now we begin the ascent to $250,000 by year-end. Of course, this is not an exact science, but using the gold example, if I had to place a bet on whether I thought bitcoin would hit $76,500 or $110,000 first, I would bet on the latter.” Last month, Powell warned the risk of recession is rising—something BlackRock’s head of bitcoin and crypto has predicted could be a “big catalyst” for the bitcoin price.

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Plaid, which connects bank accounts to financial applications, has sold about $575 million worth of common stock at a $6.1 billion post-money valuation, the fintech company confirmed to TechCrunch. The valuation is about less than half of the $13.4 billion that San Francisco-based Plaid was valued at when it raised a $425 million Series D in April 2021 in a round led by Altimeter Capital. A spokesperson acknowledged the decrease, saying it was “simply a reflection of the contraction of multiples across the market.” Indeed, higher interest rates have led to lower valuations for many startups that last raised at the top of the high cycle in 2021. Still, Plaid’s new valuation is about 15% higher than the $5.3 billion Visa was going to pay for the company before that acquisition deal fell apart in January of 2021 due to regulatory concerns. Plaid will not go public in 2025 but it is a milestone the company continues “to track towards,” according to the spokesperson. In October 2023, Plaid named former Expedia exec Eric Hart to serve as its new chief financial officer. The fact that it appeared to be eyeing an IPO — albeit with no timeline — drew attention. Today, the company maintains that it is “well-capitailized.” “Plaid’s business is in a great position and we’re optimistic about the opportunity ahead,” the spokesperson said. Franklin Templeton led the “oversubscribed” raise, which also included participation from new backers Fidelity Management and Research, BlackRock, and others in addition to existing investors NEA and Ribbit Capital. Plaid characterized the transaction as “not a Series E,” but rather a sale of common stock, which involves a company directly issuing new shares to raise capital. This is different from a secondary share sale, which occurs when existing shareholders sell their shares to other investors, without the company receiving any new capital. The proceeds of the round will be used to address employee tax withholding obligations related to the conversion of expiring RSUs (restricted stock units) to shares, and to offer some liquidity to its current team via an employee tender offer, CEO and co-founder Zach Perret (pictured above) said in a blog post. While the company did not break down how much capital exactly was going toward each initiative, a spokesperson told TechCrunch the majority of the secondary sale was going toward the conversion of the RSUs that will be expiring in the coming years. “We raised the capital to cover the RSU expiry issue and there is a small tender for employees, but it is not the entirety of the round,” the spokesperson said. Restricted stock units are typically issued to employees through a vesting schedule after they achieve required performance milestones or upon remaining with their employer for a particular length of time. This raise comes on the heels of what Perret described as a “record-setting year on revenue, a return to positive operating margins, and a meaningful increase in the companies and markets” Plaid serves. He didn’t provide hard revenue figures, saying that revenue grew over 25% in 2024 and that the company was approaching “sustained profitability.” In a shareholder letter viewed by TechCrunch, Perret also wrote that new products represented more than 20% of Plaid’s ARR in 2024, “compounding at 93% annually.” Founded in 2012, Plaid got its start as a company that connects consumer bank accounts to financial applications but has since been gradually expanding its offerings to also include lending, identity verification, credit reporting, anti-fraud, and payments. Being a multi-product company has led to traction beyond the traditional fintech customers it started out serving. President Jen Taylor told TechCrunch last June that enterprise and traditional financial institution growth was “starting to outpace the rest of its business.” Overall, Plaid saw “a big upswing in the number of enterprises” it serves in 2024, Perret wrote in the shareholder letter. The company counts Citi, Robinhood, H&R Block, Invitation Homes, GoFundMe, Zillow, and Rocket as “key customers.” Perret also wrote: “Our goal is to build software that makes the financial system easier and better for everyone.

Title: Plaid Raises $575 Million In Funding At $6.1 Billion Valuation

ByJeff Kauflin ByJeff Kauflin, Forbes Staff. Plaid CEO Zach Perret is raising money to cover an upcoming tax bill and to let employees sell some of their Plaid stock. San Francisco-based Plaid, whose main business is helping fintechs and other companies connect to consumers’ bank accounts, is raising $575 million in a deal that values it at $6.1 billion, down more than 50% from the $13.4 billion it reached in 2021. The investment is being led by large asset management firms including Franklin Templeton, Fidelity Management and Research and BlackRock, with venture capital firms NEA and Ribbit also investing. A spokesperson for the 12-year-old company says most of the proceeds will be used to cover tax liabilities that will come due over the next few years, when employees’ restricted stock units (RSUs)—a form of equity compensation where a business promises to grant you stock at a future date–vest and convert into common stock. Plaid will use a “small portion” of the $575 million fundraise to buy back stock from employees in a tender offer, letting them cash out a small part of their Plaid stock, according to a spokesperson. After Plaid pays for its coming tax liability and the employee tender offer, it will use whatever is left of the $575 million to help fund its business, though it expects that to be “a minimal amount.” Have a story tip? Contact Jeff Kauflin at jkauflin@forbes.com or on Signal at jeff.273. Stripe took a similar step in March 2023 with a $6.5 billion tender offer that allowed employees to sell their private shares in the company, and it has done at least two more tender offers since then. In recent years, Plaid has expanded beyond its core bank-account-linking features into three new lines of business: credit-risk analytics, fraud prevention and pay-by-bank. That has helped reverse the growth slowdown the company saw in 2023, when it expanded just 12%. In 2024, its revenue rose 25% and exceeded $300 million, and its gross profit margin was roughly 80%, according to a person familiar with its business. The company still wasn’t profitable on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis. The fintech market has improved notably since it began on a downward trajectory in 2022. In the first quarter of 2025, fintechs raised roughly $10.3 billion in funding globally, according to CB Insights, the highest quarterly total since the first quarter of 2023. Digital bank Chime and buy-now, pay-later giant Klarna are planning to go public over the next few months, but Plaid is unlikely to try to IPO this year. “Our hope is that we will get there in the next couple years, but no plans for a 2025 IPO,” Plaid CEO Zach Perret told Bloomberg in January. Last month, The Information reported that Plaid was planning a fundraise at a valuation of roughly $6 billion.

Title: Boomers face a 'devastating' blow to their life savings as more tariff pain looms, finance guru warns

Many people could be left disappointed when they open their IRA statements in the coming days — and President Donald Trump's "Liberation Day" tariffs threaten to make things even worse. The S&P 500 fell 5% in the first three months of 2025, marking its worst quarter since 2022, while the Nasdaq Composite slumped 10% as stocks like Tesla plunged 36%. Those declines have taken a bite out of many people's investments in the stock market, and could disrupt their retirement plans if they continue. "For the small investor, the decline in value will be devastating, particularly for retired baby boomers" who draw their incomes from their retirement accounts, Peter Ricchiuti, a senior professor of finance at Tulane University's Freeman School of Business, told Business Insider. The sell-off is partly in reaction to Trump's topsy-turvy tariffs in recent weeks, which have made it "impossible" for business owners to make decisions, Ricchiuti said. The former investment manager, who once oversaw Louisiana's $3 billion portfolio as the assistant state treasurer, said that running a company has become a "game of Whack-A-Mole" because everyone is trying to guess which industry will be hit next. Trump unveiled tariffs of at least 10% on imports from virtually all foreign countries on Wednesday, with higher rates for nations with a large trade deficit with the US. Goods from China, the number-two exporter to the US after Mexico, will be subject to a 54% tariff from April 9 if nothing changes. The news sent the S&P down almost 5% on Thursday, as key constituents Tesla and Nvidia tumbled by about 6% and 8% respectively. Tariffs push up costs for companies and prices for consumers, while uncertainty discourages hiring, expansion, and spending. Those forces slow corporate earnings growth, eroding valuations and sending stocks lower, Ricchiuti said. Strategists at Goldman Sachs cut their S&P 500 forecast last week, citing the incoming tariffs as their main rationale. They predicted the index would decline a further 5% this quarter and gain 6% over the next 12 months, down from 0% and 16%, respectively. One pressing concern is that Trump ratcheting up import taxes will cause countries around the world to retaliate by imposing reciprocal tariffs on imports from the US. Ricchiuti said that's one reason why tariffs never succeed in leveling terms of trade and instead act as "prosperity killers." During Trump's first term, he imposed sweeping tariffs on goods ranging from steel and aluminum to solar panels and washing machines, and broad-based duties on imports from China. The tariffs led to material price increases and reductions in Americans' real income, studies have found. Another worry for investors and everyday Americans alike is that if tariffs lead consumers to cut back on spending and companies to retrench, overall economic growth could suffer. Ricchiuti flagged there is mounting concern on Wall Street that Trump's trade battles will "cause a recession or even the much-feared stagflation." BlackRock CEO Larry Fink described the national mood in his yearly letter on Monday. "I hear it from nearly every client, nearly every leader — nearly every person — I talk to: They're more anxious about the economy than any time in recent memory," he wrote. Another wave of tariff chaos is now threatening to hit stocks that have already retreated. The timing is terrible for boomers living off their nest eggs, who could see their retirement funds dwindle if they're pulling money out at the same time their stock holdings are falling in value. Ricchiuti bemoaned that the economy was on a good path with falling inflation and record corporate earnings and stock prices ahead of Trump's inauguration. "The worst part of all this is that these economic wounds are self-inflicted," he said. Jump to

Title: Could the US and China Conclude an Agreement Halting the Momentum Toward Conflict?

Forgot Your Password? New to The Nation? Subscribe Print subscriber? Activate your online access How Trump’s attack on the global order endangers a deal Beijing might otherwise accept. An unexpected bright spot in the months following Trump’s election victory was his repeated support for some kind of agreement with China. Under Biden, the two most powerful countries in the world had seemed headed for certain conflict, and Trump’s campaign bluster promised even worse tensions. But now Trump was claiming that the two countries “can, together, solve all of the problems of the world,” and China was discreetly sending out feelers about what it could offer to bring off such a deal. Then suddenly, the whole tenor of the relationship abruptly changed. On March 4, China’s Foreign Ministry said: “If the US is determined to fight a tariff war, a trade war—or any other kind of war—China will meet the attack and fight to the finish.” Two days later, the ministry doubled down on the theme, promising that, “no matter if it’s a cold war or a hot war,” the US will not win. The events of March 4 lay bare the reasons that Trump is, at one and the same time, tantalizingly close to his proclaimed goal of world peace and alarmingly close to sending the relationship with China spiraling into conflict. Trump’s antipathy toward the global order, now inspiring an unprecedented attack on the post-Cold War institutions that once sustained American power, is both the reason he can offer such a deal and a source of deep disquiet in Beijing. Deciphering this tension is the key to understanding not just Trump’s China policy but his whole foreign policy agenda. What led to the sudden shift in Chinese rhetoric? Earlier on March 4, alongside 25 percent tariffs on Mexico and Canada that were soon suspended, Trump unceremoniously imposed on China his second across-the-board 10 percent tariff increase in as many months. Like the first one, he justified this one with an absolutist demand—difficult both practically and politically—that China immediately suppress the production of all fentanyl precursor chemicals. Just weeks into his second term, Trump has already quietly levied larger tariffs on China than across the entire world-shaking trade war of his first term—and those first-term tariffs are still in place. Also on March 4, Hong Kong firm C K Hutchison announced that it would sell its overseas ports business—including its two (of five total) Panama Canal ports—to US asset firm BlackRock. While both companies insisted that the sale was a normal commercial transaction, the context of Trump’s repeated condemnation of a “Chinese” presence in the canal was lost on no one. China is now considering how it might prevent the sale from going forward. In his address to Congress that same night, Trump bragged about the ports sale but otherwise barely raised the issue of China. His repeated threats against the territorial integrity of various allies, though, must have raised questions within the sovereignty-obsessed Chinese leadership. Despite these misgivings, Beijing has continued to express its interest in negotiations. After all, Trump’s mercantile sensibility and his disdain for the sacred cows of American geopolitical primacy allow him to take seriously Chinese interests and consider a settlement that could work for both powers. This marks a sharp contrast with Biden’s foreign policy team, who imagined they could avoid conflict with China by conducting rudimentary diplomatic routines even as they steadily exacerbated the pressures toward conflict. The core Biden strategy was to build up US alliances around the principle of excluding China while offering concessions to countries in the Global South if they joined such an exclusionary regime. Convinced of their own righteousness, the administration had difficulty recognizing how such an approach looked from Beijing. Trump, in contrast, recognizes a kindred spirit in Xi Jinping, who shares his own priorities of commercial success and authoritarian control. Unlike Biden’s foreign policy team, Trump does not seek strategic advantage over every space of geopolitical power in the world, so he is less likely to exacerbate Beijing’s fears of encirclement or its anxiety that Taiwan could be permanently separated. Moreover, Trump conceptualizes the economy as a market, where those with bargaining power squeeze profit out of those who lack it, rather than a supply chain, in which power accumulates at strategic nodes associated with scarce goods or technologies. This, too, makes agreement with Beijing more likely, since Trump places less priority than Biden on strangling China’s access to technology or demanding deep changes to China’s political economy. All of this substantiates the hope that the US and China could conclude an agreement capable of breaking the momentum toward conflict. More than Trump’s hunger to see himself as a dealmaker, his whole mode of reasoning establishes the conditions for mutual accommodation between the two powers. Yet both the style and substance of Trump’s leadership also pose a significant threat to that potential. Despite a more pliable set of officials staffing his second than his first administration, the trademark chaos of the first term is just as evident today. That is profoundly unnerving to Beijing, characteristically stuck on protocol and obsessed with stability. Illustrative of the diplomatic pitfalls of such disorganization is that, even after two rounds of punishing tariffs, the administration still can’t explain what it actually wants from China. The shift in Chinese rhetoric in part registers exasperation. However, the most dangerous part of Trump’s foreign policy is not the erratic diplomacy but what seems to be the unifying line running through all the vacillations. Whether threatening to annex neighbors, smashing up the world humanitarian system, shredding the rules of global trade, or actively supporting the nativist opposition across a number of allies, the common thread of all the administration’s early foreign policy moves is open hostility to what remains of the institutions and ideology of neoliberal globalization. Dave Zirin Ellen Schrecker Jeet Heer Chris Lehmann For four decades, this so-called liberal international order secured America’s position as global hegemon by convincing elites in other countries that they too could gain from free market reform, corporate power, political liberalization, and US suzerainty. But in part because the system failed an increasingly large number of Americans and in part because it constrained the naked exercise of force, the Trump administration now aims to eradicate it. Chinese leaders may be perfectly happy to see hypocritical American paeans to democracy and the rule of law despoiled. The danger is that those same leaders are deeply invested in other core institutions of the system—those parts that secure stability for commerce, promote economic development, and legitimize governing elites. Contrary to the portrayal that dominates DC thinking, in which China is thought to be bent on destroying the rules-based international order so that it can bully weaker countries for gain, China is in fact a cautious and conservative status quo power. It is hostile to those parts of the global system that undermine the political regime’s claims or that represent the unilateral use of force, but the rules of world trade, the prerogatives of state sovereignty, the smooth operation of multilateral institutions to address transnational problems, and the right to development for every country are all basic commitments in state policy. The official line that Chinese foreign policy seeks “win-win cooperation” is based on the (often unreliable) assumption that all these principles are mutually beneficial. Polemical depictions of China come much closer to describing the aims of Trump’s foreign policy than Xi Jinping’s. Ironically, the Trump administration might accept the DC portrayal of Chinese goals as accurate but unobjectionable—surely all great powers would squeeze their neighbors if the artificial constraints of global order were removed. They may believe that they can make Beijing an attractive offer: no longer trying to cut China out of the system and instead simply destroying the system, after which the great powers will be free to work out among themselves how to divide the spoils. If the United States builds an exclusionary sphere of interest in the Western Hemisphere, China could make peace with that because it could prey on countries in its own sphere to make up for lost tribute. We do not know whether anyone in the administration has gone this far in working out the consequences of their current path. But the logic of US actions is great-power predation pushing in the direction of closed imperial blocs. Such an outcome is a nonstarter with China—not just because Beijing would not trust the US to leave it enough space for its own depredations, but because it considers parts of the liberal international order crucial to its own success.

Title: VanEck Seeks BNB ETF Approval—Big Win For Binance?

Investment giant VanEck has registered a Binance Coin (BNB) exchange-traded fund in Delaware, marking its fifth cryptocurrency ETF registration in the state. The move comes as major financial institutions continue to bet on digital assets despite market volatility. According to public records on Delaware’s official state website, VanEck registered the new product on Monday under filing number 10148820. The “VanEck BNB ETF” was registered as a trust corporate service company, following similar registrations for Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Avalanche ETFs. The New York-based company confirmed the BNB ETF will track the price of Binance Coin, currently ranked as the fifth-largest cryptocurrency with a market value of approximately $599. On-chain data showed BNB’s trading volume jumped 40% to over $2 billion after the announcement. VanEck’s filing represents the first attempt to create a Binance Coin ETF specifically for US investors. While other BNB-related products exist in global markets, such as the 21Shares Binance ETP, none are based in the United States. The 21Shares product remains the only exchange-traded note tracking the Binance Coin index. JUST IN: VanEck Registers Entity for Potential First BNB ETF in the U.S. VanEck has filed in Delaware to register an entity, hinting at plans for the first-ever BNB ETF in the U.S. market. The move marks a significant step towards expanding the accessibility of Binance Coin… pic.twitter.com/iFXBVu4mkD — Crypto Town Hall (@Crypto_TownHall) April 2, 2025 The registration follows VanEck’s successful launches of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs last year after securing Securities and Exchange Commission approval. The company manages nearly $115 billion in client assets globally. “VanEck seems to be taking a ‘throw everything at the wall and see what sticks’ approach, which makes sense,” said Sumit Roy, senior ETF analyst at etf.com. “Avalanche isn’t the most widely traded cryptocurrency, but being first to market with an ETF in a new category comes with potential upside and little downside.” The move comes just weeks after VanEck applied for SEC approval to launch the first AVAX ETF. Based on reports from Delaware’s state website, that document was registered under file number 10125689. VanEck isn’t alone in pursuing alternative cryptocurrency ETFs. Grayscale has also applied to launch funds based on XRP, Solana, and Dogecoin. The firm’s Bitcoin fund currently manages nearly $17 billion and ranks third among Bitcoin funds from companies like BlackRock and Fidelity. The surge in ETF applications follows the strong performance of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum funds in 2023. Crypto-based exchange-traded products have drawn approximately $44 billion in assets during 2024 alone. The NASDAQ exchange also submitted an application to the SEC on March 28 to list shares of an Avalanche ETF issued by crypto asset manager Grayscale. According to filing documents, Grayscale’s AVAX fund would use Coinbase Custody as its custodian. VanEck’s latest move with BNB suggests major financial institutions see growing investor appetite for regulated cryptocurrency investment vehicles beyond just Bitcoin. The company filed for a Solana ETF in June 2024, making it the first potential SOL exchange-traded fund in the US. To gain official approval, VanEck must now file a formal S-1 form with the SEC for these newly registered crypto ETFs.

Title: “Patriotic” Pushback by Chinese State Media Challenges CK Hutchison Port Deal

Select Page Posted by Arthur Kaufman | Apr 2, 2025 Hong Kong conglomerate CK Hutchison and its owner Li Ka-shing have found themselves in the crosshairs of the Chinese government over a multibillion-dollar port deal, which received heavy criticism in state media for supposedly undermining China’s national interests. This external pressure has stalled the deal and raised questions about the extent of Beijing’s influence over Hong Kong companies and Chinese-owned ports around the world, notably near the Panama canal. Jeffie Lam, Denise Tsang, and Lam Ka-sing from the South China Morning Post provided more details and first reported that, contrary to expectations, the deal would not be signed by this week: The sale of CK Hutchison’s two ports at each end of the Panama Canal was part of a US$23 billion deal to sell 43 ports spread over 23 countries to a consortium led by United States investment firm BlackRock. CK Hutchison will pocket US$19 billion. […] “We have noticed this transaction, and will review it in accordance with the law to ensure fair competition in the market and safeguard the public interest,” a spokesman from the anti-monopoly department under [China’s State Administration for Market Regulation] said in a written reply. The watchdog did not reveal when the investigation would be launched but its response was later reposted on the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office website. […] Earlier on Friday, a source close to CK Hutchison said the conglomerate would not go ahead with the expected signing of the deal [this] Wednesday. “There will not be an official signing of the two Panama ports deal next week,” a source close to CK Hutchison told the Post [last Friday]. April 2 was a deadline set for CK Hutchison and the BlackRock consortium to sign a definitive agreement over the deal for the two ports, according to an announcement of the sale on March 4. [Source] The Chinese government signaled its opposition to the deal through the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office’s reposting of over half a dozen articles published by pro-Beijing Hong Kong newspaper Ta Kung Pao that criticized the deal. The articles described the deal as being “in concert with US hegemony” and said it would lead to “historic mistakes”. On Saturday, the CCTV-linked Weibo account Yuyuantantian posted that the deal was “tantamount to handing a knife to an opponent,” but the post was deleted just minutes later. (See our recent explanation of “handing someone a knife” for more details on the phrase.) On Monday, Oiwan Lam at Global Voices described the criticism of CK Hutchison’s deal in these articles: Hong Kong-based Chinese propaganda slammed CK Hutchison’s deal as a betrayal of the “motherland” through a series of commentaries which were republished on the website of Beijing’s top office on Hong Kong and Macau Affairs. The patriotic opinion pieces were first published in China’s state-funded Ta Kung Pao on March 14. The first piece rejects CK Hutchison’s explanation that the deal was a purely commercial decision. It describes Blackrock’s role as an expanding US port operator that would repress China’s international trade upon taking over CK Hutchison’s port and concludes the deal was an act of betrayal: […] The second commentary praises other Hong Kong business leaders, including Henry Fok Ying-tung and Yue-kong Pao, for staying loyal to the party and, in particular, highlights Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei’s role in safeguarding the technological sovereignty of the Chinese telecommunication industry. It urges Chinese businessmen to safeguard China’s national interest. The third and fourth pieces were written in a similar manner, stressing the need for the business sector to serve national interest and demanding that CK Hutchison suspend the deal. Pro-Beijing influencers also relay China’s discontent. @Hnbhger17, for example, argued on X that CK Hutchison should prioritize selling its port to Chinese corporations, or the deal would negatively impact China’s national security. [Source] The issue of Li Ka-shing’s patriotism, or alleged lack thereof, has been the subject of heated debate by Chinese netizens, and many online articles and comments supportive of Li have been deleted by platform censors. CDT Chinese editors have archived ten recent essays and articles on the subject, at least three of which have since been censored. A now-deleted satirical essay from WeChat public account 捉刀漫谈max (Zhuōdāo màntán max, "Ghostwriter Chat max") posed the facetious question “How About If Li Ka-Shing Just Sells the Ports to Russia?” and mocked the blind nationalism of those urging Li to ignore business fundamentals and bend the knee to Beijing. An article by WeChat blogger Xu Peng noted the irony of those who would criticize Li for not being “patriotic” enough—despite his decades of generous donations to charitable causes in China—while conveniently overlooking nationalist pundit Sima Nan’s rather unpatriotic record of tax evasion. A now-censored article by science and current-affairs blogger Xiang Dongliang pointed out that CK Hutchison’s proposal only involves the sale of usage rights to the ports—because the ports themselves are under the sovereignty of the nations in which they are located—and that the company does not plan to sell the usage rights to any ports located in China or Hong Kong. Xiang argued that the proposed sale is motivated by CK Hutchison’s need to hedge economic and geopolitical risk, and that absent other Chinese buyers (who would be subject to the same challenges), it is only rational for the company to offload usage rights to the ports to American consortium BlackRock. If the Chinese government and online nationalists are genuinely concerned about port control falling into American hands, Xiang wrote, they should encourage so-called “patriotic” Chinese companies such as Huawei or Hongxing Erke to bid for the ports instead. A selection of Weibo comments compiled by CDT Chinese editors gives some sense of the heated nationalist rhetoric on Chinese social media in response to Li Ka-shing and CK Hutchison’s plan. “Li Ka-shing’s ‘selling out the country for his own benefit’ deserves the contempt of every Chinese person,” fumed one Weibo user. "Those who insist on ‘short-selling’ their own motherland will disappear in the end!" wrote another. Some of the critical comments brushed aside arguments that the proposed sale was simply a sound business decision: “The interests of the nation and the people should always outrank individual benefit,” one Weibo user opined. “Businesspeople must not be solely profit-driven.” While Beijing announced it was investigating CK Hutchison’s deal, legal experts said it could be difficult to prove a real risk of breaching China’s anti-monopoly laws. Alonso Illueca at the China-Global South Project described how the Chinese government might also resort to Hong Kong’s National Security Law in order to stop the deal: In this case, articles 31 and 37 of the national security law allow for its application to companies. Although CK Hutchison is registered in the Cayman Islands and its owner, Li Kai-Shing, has moved most of its assets to Canada, both China and Hong Kong still retain some leverage. There are reports of ongoing talks to find “a reasonable way out” of the current situation, accompanied by a pause in new collaborations between Chinese state-owned companies and CK Hutchison. Given the broad interpretation of “safeguarding national security,” the principle that guides the Hong Kong national security law, Beijing and Hong Kong could argue that the CK Hutchison-BlackRock deal threatens China’s national security and warrants intervention from the State to safeguard it. Moreover, Ta Kung Pao called for applying China’s Anti-Foreign Sanctions Law against CK Hutchison, which allows Beijing to impose countermeasures on foreign entities that enforce sanctions or harm China’s interests and has advocated for punitive measures if the deal goes forward. The newspaper also invoked Hong Kong’s National Security Ordinance, further signaling potential legal challenges. [Source] #Panama: Why did #China pressure Hutchison Port Holdings to delay the @BlackRock deal? Hutchison was the single largest Chinese company in the business. A deal for 43 ports in 23 countries–199 berths–would have meant one-third of #PRC's global port network wiped out instantly. pic.twitter.com/fYxyAqV8R1 — Ryan Berg, PhD (@RyanBergPhD) March 28, 2025 Many commentators highlighted the consequences should Beijing succeed in blocking CK Hutchison’s deal. Bryan Mercurio, a professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said “it would be an unprecedented move that could reinforce the claims of President Trump and others asserting that Hong Kong’s trade, finance and policies are not entirely independent from China.” Josh Lipsky, senior director at the Atlantic Council’s GeoEconomics Center, said, “Torpedoing the deal . . . would send shockwaves all around the financial world.” Commentator Xiang Dongliang noted the potentially chilling effects: “Global investors would conclude that there is no real difference between the government oversight of Hong Kong companies and mainland Chinese companies.” Sinocism’s Bill Bishop predicted, “Now that the PRC has made clear the national security concerns about [the] ports deal, all of their ports globally may be suspect. So they may block this deal, but expect pressure on PRC port holdings in other parts of the world now.” In an article for Al Jazeera, Erin Hale described Li’s evolution from having close relations to Deng Xiaoping and Jiang Zemin, to his waning political influence under Xi Jinping, along with his gradual divestment away from China. The article references Kevin Yam as saying that “Beijing could use the deal to make an example of the Li family, much as it did to Alibaba founder Jack Ma.” (In 2020, Xi took the dramatic move to suspend the initial public offering of Ma’s Ant Group after Ma openly challenged government regulators.) A now-deleted article from Sina Finance highlighted the precarity of Li’s situation—and indeed that of all Chinese entrepreneurs—where national interests are at stake: “When capital collides with the contest between great powers, even the smartest entrepreneurs discover that they are just ordinary people—buffeted by the tides of history, or trapped between a rock and a hard place, and utterly unable to control their own destiny.” Categories : China & the World,Economy,Law,Level 2 Article,Politics Tags :business,business disputes,chinese business,Chinese companies,companies,competition,discourse censorship,financial regulation,global influence,Global South,hong kong national security law,Li Ka-Shing,maritime security,multinational companies,national security,netizen comments,online censorship,Panama,private sector,regulation,regulations,regulators,social media censorship,translation excerpt,U.S. China business competition,United States Click on the image to download Firefly for circumvention 2024 Copyright © China Digital Times CDT is a non-profit media site, and we need your support.

Title: Investors query Government cushion in €1.2bn AIB buyback
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2025/04/03/investors-query-government-cushion-in-12bn-aib-buyback/
Time Published: 2025-04-03T05:00:00Z

The terms of AIB’s upcoming €1.2 billion buyback of shares held by the Government – as it hastens an exit from the bank’s shareholder register – are raising questions from some other big shareholders, in light of the stock’s recent pullback, according to market sources. With good reason. AIB, led by chief executive Colin Hunt, announced earlier this week that the shares would be repurchased, subject to shareholder approval at the bank’s annual general meeting (agm) in a month’s time, at a minimum of €6.26. It would reduce taxpayers’ holding in the bank, which required a €20.8 billion bailout during the financial crisis, to about 3 per cent. The floor price was based on the stock’s volume-weighted average price – or VWAP, as it is known in the stock market – for the five business days to Tuesday of last week, less almost 37 cent to account for a planned dividend on AIB’s profit for 2024. If the average VWAP is higher than €6.26 in the five days before the shareholder meeting on May 1st, the buyback price can be adjusted upwards to that level. The problem for other shareholders – who, let’s not forget, are not being offered a chance to sell into the buyback, is that AIB’s shares have fallen over the past week or so to as low as €5.78. The shares had peaked at €7.26 early last month, the highest levels since the Government first sold shares in the bank in 2017, after the bank reported better-than-expected full year results. The subsequent pullback has come as some investors locked in profits (US investment giant BlackRock last week sold more than a 3 per cent stake on the market, reducing its holding to about 8.5 per cent), while others fretted about how US president Donald Trump’s trade war would affect the Irish economy. Concerns about the pace of new Irish house building and its effect on mortgage growth have also tempered enthusiasm towards Irish banks. Will a head of steam build up among institutional and small shareholders alike on the terms of the repurchase if AIB’s shares continue their retreat in advance of the agm? Or will they just suck it up for the sake of the bigger objective of seeing the Government off the pitch?

Title: Overview of Secular Markets

A young lady where I volunteer asked me when I started saving. I started saving as a child, but had no money saved until nearly thirty years later when I started down a “stable” career path after graduating with an engineering degree and an MBA. I described to her that Fidelity’s guideline is to have one year’s income saved by age 30 and 10 times your income by the time you retire. The next question was, “How do you protect your savings from severe corrections in retirement?” I explained that inflation is the silent risk of being too conservative and described target date funds as perhaps being ideal for someone starting out in savings when the daily challenges of home and work life weigh heavy on time requirements. Secular markets can play a major role in your success as an investor over your lifetime. Figure #1 shows the returns for the past thirty years for the S&P 500 (SPY), Vanguard Total Bond Market fund (VBMFX), Fidelity International Discover fund (FIGRX), and Fidelity Balanced fund (FBALX). The obvious conclusion is that the S&P 500 has outperformed the other asset classes by a large margin, but it would be a poor assumption to assume that this holds true for the next ten or twenty years. Figure #1: Equity and Bond Markets with Valuations and 10-Year Treasury Yields Source: Author using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. Three of the most important factors for future returns are starting valuations and yields, along with inflation. Ed Easterling is the founder of Crestmont Research and author of Unexpected Returns: Understanding Secular Stock and Probable Outcomes: Secular Stock Market Insights, which provide incredible insight into the relationship of these factors. For those interested in long-term trends for the stock market, I recommend reading Mr. Easterling’s The P/E Report: Annual Review Of The Price/Earnings Ratio. He concludes that the “stock market’s valuation remains too elevated for an extended period of above-average returns.” He describes that this may occur “either by a significant decline over a shorter period or by a minimal decline over a longer period.” NOTE: During the 1995 to 2012 period, real GDP averaged 2.6% annually. The population growth rate declined from 1.2% in 1995 to 0.73% in 2012. Population growth is a key driver of economic growth. Notice in Figure #1 above that the Fidelity Balanced fund (FBALX) performed as well as the S&P 500 for the first twenty years. Why? For the first twenty years, the price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) hovered around the long-term median outside of recessions of about 15 except for the 1997 to 2002 run-up in the Dotcom bubble, which reached 34. Secondly, an investor could make decent returns in bonds. The Vanguard Total Bond Market fund (VBMFX) had an average annualized return of about 6.5% from 1995 through 2022. The Fidelity Balanced fund (FBALX) did as well as the S&P 500 because stocks and bonds are inversely related, and when stocks decline, bonds typically go up. Also, notice that international stocks performed as well as the S&P 500 throughout most of this time period. A diversified portfolio would have performed well. NOTE: From 2013 to 2024, real GDP grew at an annualized rate of 2.5% annually. Population growth fell to 0.59% during this time period. The Great Financial Crisis of 2008/2009 changed the market environment with Quantitative Easing that the Federal Reserve began in 2008 and the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) that Congress passed in 2009. They served their purpose to avert a major depression by providing stability and stimulus. However, continued easy monetary policy and more stimulus during the COVID recession have suppressed bond yields for most of the past fifteen years. The P/E ratio has risen to close to 30, which is near the expensive levels of the Dotcom years. Quantitative Tightening, a recovering economy, and Inflation have pushed bond yields back up to normal levels. The Federal deficit has risen from 2.5% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 1995 to over 6% last year. This caused the Federal debt to rise from 65% of GDP to 122% now. This is unsustainable. The Federal Reserve released its March 19, 2025, FOMC Projections in which the median estimates of real GDP are 1.7% to 1.8% for 2025 through 2027 and 1.8% for the longer run. Inflation for Personal Consumption Expenditures is estimated to fall to 2.2% in 2026 and reach the baseline of 2.0% in 2027. The Federal Funds rate is estimated to fall gradually to 3.1 in 2027 and be 3.0% in the longer term. Of course, tariffs add uncertainty to forecasts. Davide Barbuscia reports in “Moody’s Says US Fiscal Strength On Course For Continued Decline” at Reuters that “the U.S.’ fiscal strength is on track for a continued multi-year decline as budget deficits widen and debt becomes less affordable.” Moody’s says that debt affordability is weaker than for other highly rated sovereigns. According to Moody’s, persistently high tariffs are likely to hinder growth. An inverted yield curve is when long-term rates are lower than short-term rates. It makes it harder for banks to lend money, which greases the wheels of industry. An inverted yield curve has been a reliable indicator of recessions. Figure #2 shows the inverted yield curve in September before the Federal Reserve lowered short-term interest rates. The yield curve on Election Day suggested that investors thought the Federal Reserve might achieve a “soft landing” and avoid a recession. Parts of the current yield curve have inverted as investors are now concerned about tariffs increasing inflation and that the economy is slowing. Figure #2: Treasury Yield Curves – Past Six Months Source: Author using St Louis Federal Reserve FRED database Table #1 contains Lipper Bond Categories that I put in my long-term investment bucket strategy. Intermediate yields have been falling, so bonds with longer durations have returned 2% to 3% over the past three months. Yields are mostly over 4%, providing income for retirees. Table #1: Investment Bucket #3 – Bonds with Author’s Top-Rated Funds Source: Author using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset; Morningstar for three-month return as of March 21st Table #2 shows what I call Tier One Lipper equity categories with low Price-to-Book (P/B) valuations, lower risk (Ulcer Index), and higher yields compared to the S&P 500 as of March 21st. The S&P 500 is down 4.2% for the past three months but has corrected about 10% from its February high. International equity funds have returned 8% to 13% over the past three months. The P/B is less than half of the S&P 500, and yields are two to three times that of the S&P 500. Buybacks for US companies have contributed to lower yields in the US because capital gains are generally taxed at lower rates than ordinary dividends. Rising international equity funds have reduced the impact of the S&P 500 falling in diversified portfolios. Table #2: Lipper Equity Categories with Low Valuations, Lower Risk, and High Yields Source: Author using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset; Morningstar for three-month return as of March 21st The Congressional Budget Office published Projections of Deficits and Debt Under Alternative Scenarios for the Budget and Interest Rates last month which analyzed the case where provisions of the 2017 tax act that changed the individual income tax are extended indefinitely, including lower statutory tax rates, the changes to allowable deductions, the larger child tax credit, the 20 percent deduction for certain business income, and the income levels at which the alternative minimum tax takes effect. They conclude that if the 2017 Tax Act is extended, “Primary deficits over the first decade of the projection period (fiscal years 2025 to 2034) are about $4 trillion larger. By 2054, the primary deficit equals 3.7 percent of GDP, 1.5 percentage points higher than in CBO’s extended baseline.” Inflation is a rise in prices for goods and services. Tariffs are a tax on importers, which undoubtedly will be passed on to consumers. Tariffs are a one-time increase in prices to a higher level. The impact is higher long-term prices until supply chains have time to at least partially adjust. Economists attribute the trade deficit to a high rate of domestic consumption and a low savings rate. High labor rates in the US compared to developing countries and mobility of technology have also contributed to the deficit. Increasing tariffs doesn’t address these factors. Mixed-Asset (MA) funds invest in multiple asset classes, including stocks and bonds, and may include international equities. I like them for younger investors who want a professional manager to select investments and rebalance. In retirement, I like having more control over withdrawal strategies and only having a small amount invested in MA funds. Table #3 contains a subset of the mixed-asset funds that I track. The return over the past three months shows how they are performing now, but I suspect it also provides a glimpse into the future. I expect funds with lower valuations, international exposure, higher allocations to bonds, and higher yields to outperform on a risk-adjusted basis. Table #3: Mixed Asset Funds with Author’s Top-Rated Funds Source: Author using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset; Morningstar for three-month return as of March 21st Figure #3 shows the three-year performance of selected funds. Below are shown some interesting possibilities. I will watch the markets for the next few months before making any decisions. At first glance, BlackRock Tactical Opportunities (PCBAX) and Eaton Vance Global Macro Absolute Return (EAGMX) appeal to me. Both are available at Fidelity without transaction fees and with the load waived. Figure #3: Selected Mixed-Asset Funds Source: Author using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. What has propelled the US stock markets higher over the past several years is easy monetary policy, Federal stimulus, and rising valuations. I believe that uncertainty is taking its toll on investors and consumers. A diversified portfolio with bonds and international equities should perform well in the coming decade because of favorable valuations internationally and normalized bond yields.

Jobs and investment in Scotland will be top of the agenda today [Thursday 3 April] when Scottish Secretary Ian Murray, Lord Mayor of London Alastair King and Scottish Financial Enterprise Chief Executive Sandy Begbie meet key sectors in a series of meetings in New York during Tartan Week. In a co-ordinated effort aimed at boosting growth in Scotland they will invite companies to attend the Scottish Investor Summit - organised by Scottish Financial Enterprise and The City of London Corporation - to be held in Edinburgh in October this year. The event will be key to encouraging inward investment in Scotland - investment which can boost Scotland’s economy, create well paid jobs and boost living standards, putting more money back in people’s pockets. The New York meetings will showcase Scotland’s key strengths in financial services, clean energy and life sciences to international investors. This will be held at the UK Consul General’s residence in New York and at the offices of BlackRock, a global investment management corporation with a significant presence in Scotland. Secretary of State for Scotland Ian Murray said: “At a time when we are celebrating Scotland on the international stage, we want to highlight the exceptional investment opportunities in innovative industries. These meetings and roundtables are at the heart of Brand Scotland, selling the nation on the global stage. By strengthening these international partnerships through our Plan for Change, we’re laying the groundwork for the Edinburgh Global Investment Summit.” Lord Mayor of London Alastair King said: “Tartan week is not just an opportunity to celebrate the strong cultural and economic links between Scotland and the US, it is also a chance to deepen them further especially in financial services. That is why I am in New York speaking to major US businesses and investors and promoting the forthcoming Scottish Investment Summit in Edinburgh in October “The theme of my mayoralty is ‘growth unleashed’, aiming to reignite the City’s appetite for positive risk and fully leverage the white heat of new technology to fuel economic growth across the United Kingdom. One of the best ways to do that is through greater cooperation with the US in financial services - which is a major part of both the Scottish and wider UK economy.” Chief Executive of Scottish Financial Enterprise Sandy Begbie CBE said: “Tartan week is an excellent example of the soft power which Scotland commands across the globe, but especially in the US. These roundtables provide just a small taste of the investment opportunity in Scotland. “The Scottish investment summit later this year will showcase in detail the very best of Scotland’s financial services, renewables and life science to global investors. This coupled with opportunities to engage with government stakeholders and investment prospects highlight the unique opportunity the summit will bring.” The Scottish investment summit, to be held in Edinburgh in October, will bring together major global investors, UK industry leaders, higher education institutions, and government representatives. Around 150 senior-level attendees are expected at the summit, with at least half representing significant global investors. The summit will showcase the investments that have already been made, as well as the rationale behind why firms made the decision to invest in Scotland and what have been the returns and benefits to them as a result. It will also provide opportunities for investors to engage with investment prospects that currently exist in our investment pipeline, as well as government and regulatory stakeholders.

By Todd Spangler NY Digital Editor As the deadline nears for TikTok‘s Chinese parent to cut a deal to divest controlling ownership of the app or face a U.S. ban, new bidders are coming out of the woodwork. Among the interested investors in TikTok is Tim Stokely, founder of OnlyFans — the opt-in social media platform known for hosting sexually explicit content. Stokely, who founded OnlyFans in 2016, left the company in 2021. Stokely’s new social media startup Zoop, which says it “rewards both creators and their community members for their engagement,” teamed with the Hbar Foundation, which manages the Hedera cryptocurrency network, on a joint bid for TikTok, per Reuters.

However, the newspaper reported, various parties “who have been involved in the talks do not appear to be taking Amazon’s bid seriously. Oracle and private-equity firm Blackrock also have reportedly been in talks about a deal to take an ownership stake in TikTok. Others that have come forward with bids include former L.A.

VIP+ Analysis: Meet the TikTok Rival That Gained Most From U.S. Ban – and It’s Not RedNote The value of the Zoop-led bid, which was made in conjunction with other unidentified partners, was not disclosed. Zoop co-founder RJ Phillips told Reuters, “Our bid for TikTok isn’t just about changing ownership, it’s about creating a new paradigm where both creators and their communities benefit directly from the value they generate.” President Trump was reported to be meeting with advisers Wednesday to consider next steps for TikTok. Trump set an April 5 deadline for ByteDance to either sell its controlling interest in TikTok or face a U.S. ban on national security grounds under a U.S. law that took effect Jan. 19. Supporters of the TikTok divest-or-ban law, the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, have said Trump’s 75-day enforcement delay did not have legal basis.

Title: Greenlane and Volvo’s bold plan to transform electric truck charging in the US

Greenlane is teaming up with Volvo Trucks North America to make charging heavy-duty electric vehicles (HDEVs) easier and more accessible. The charging network developer is now integrated into Volvo’s Open Charge service, which gives Volvo customers streamlined access to Greenlane’s public chargers. This collaboration makes Greenlane the first official Charge Point Operator (CPO) in North America to partner with Volvo. Greenlane is a joint venture between Daimler Truck North America, NextEra Energy, and BlackRock. It’s building a US-wide charging network for heavy-duty commercial vehicles, aiming to reduce costs and simplify switching to electric fleets. Through Volvo Open Charge, Volvo customers now have real-time access to Greenlane’s network, which means easier access to public charging, centralized billing, and special perks. Fleets won’t have to spend big money on their charging infrastructure. Instead, they can plug into Greenlane’s growing network, which will help cut costs and operational headaches while extending range. Patrick Macdonald-King, Greenlane’s CEO, called the partnership “a first-of-its-kind collaboration to deliver public charging solutions tailored to the needs of medium- and heavy-duty fleets.” He said it’s all about making the shift to electric trucks smoother and keeping goods and services moving while progressing toward zero-emissions freight. Greenlane’s flagship charging site is set to open in Colton, California, in April, with more than 40 publicly accessible chargers for everything from heavy-duty trucks to smaller electric vehicles. It’s part of a larger plan to build a network along the I-15 corridor, with stations roughly 60 to 90 miles apart. Future California locations are planned for Long Beach, Barstow, and Baker. Greenlane and Volvo will continue integrating new membership features into Volvo Open Charge, such as booking reservations. By letting fleets tap into an existing public network, Greenlane’s services can make the transition to electric trucking less about building infrastructure and more about just getting trucks on the road.

The metric, which tracks the rate of Ethereum removed from circulation, recently hit its lowest level since August 2021, a nagging concern among investors that’s “weighed on Ethereum’s market performance,” according to the crypto market maker Wintermute. Last week, around 53 ETH was burned per day, the firm said. Meanwhile, ETH’s supply has increased 3% since an upgrade called EIP-1559 took effect, according to Ultrasound Money. The lower burn rate underscores how ETH’s ability to accrue value has shifted since developers embraced layer-2 scaling solutions a year ago. Since then, Ethereum’s so-called issuance has been net positive, yet some experts believe institutional adoption trends could change that. During the first quarter, ETH’s price plummeted 45%, wiping away $170 billion in market value, according to crypto data providers CoinGecko and CoinGlass. That represented the third worst quarter for ETH going as far back as 2016. Years ago, user activity on Ethereum became a core driver of ETH’s value, when Ethereum developers implemented a fee-burning mechanism called EIP-1559 in August 2021. While Ethereum’s users previously paid transaction fees to miners, the network started burning them instead, reducing the asset’s circulating supply in relation to network activity. When Ethereum later transitioned to a proof-of-stake consensus model in 2022, making miners obsolete and vastly reducing the network’s carbon footprint, the rate at which new ETH is issued was also reduced. Together, the upgrades made Ethereum’s circulating supply deflationary. EIP-4844, an upgrade that significantly reduced the amount of ETH burned by layer-2 networks, changed that dynamic. As user activity has gravitated toward those scaling solutions, transaction fees have fallen on Ethereum too, recently hitting a five-year low of $0.40. During the pandemic-era crypto boom, so-called gas wars plagued Ethereum users, who sometimes paid upwards of $4,000 for a single transaction. NFT projects were a common yet ultimately beneficial source of congestion, like those tied to Bored Ape Yacht Club. Tokenize Everything As Wall Street starts migrating on-chain, some analysts believe that ETH could become deflationary again, if institutions end up bringing trillions of dollars of assets with them. The process of taking real-world assets, such as stocks and bonds, and representing them on-chain as digital tokens is referred to as tokenization. In a letter to shareholders, Larry Fink, CEO of the world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock, mentioned the term a dozen times. “One day, I expect tokenized funds will become as familiar to investors as ETFs,” Fink wrote. “Every stock, every bond, every fund—every asset—can be tokenized.” Excluding Ethereum’s layer-2 networks, $5 billion worth of real-world assets have been tokenized on Ethereum, accounting for 54% of the market, according to RWA.xyz. The measure excludes stablecoins, which are often backed by cash and U.S. Treasuries. That sum could broadly grow to $16 trillion by 2030, according to a paper published by Boston Consulting Group in October, but estimates from experts vary widely. “We're not seeing the economic benefits from tokenization yet,” Bitwise Senior Investment Strategist Juan Leon told Decrypt. “This is going to take longer than people want it to because these large asset managers don't move very quickly.” Edited by James Rubin Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2025 Decrypt Media, Inc.

Title: Wall Street Giant DTCC Unveils Tokenized Collateral Platform in Crypto Push

The Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC), the world’s largest securities settlement system, is pushing deeper into crypto with introducing a blockchain-based platform for tokenized collateral management. Collateral is a fundamental part of risk management in financial markets, ensuring stability amid market fluctuations. However, traditional systems often suffer from inefficiencies due to fragmented infrastructure and lagging settlements. DTCC said its new platform seeks to address these challenges by tokenizing collateral on blockchain rails, allowing for real-time transfers and automation through smart contracts, according to a Wednesday press release. The platform runs within DTCC’s AppChain ecosystem, which was developed on top of LF Decentralized Trust’s Besu blockchain. Read more: Why Asset Tokenization Is Inevitable "Collateral mobility is the ‘killer app’ for institutional use of blockchain," Dan Doney, chief technology officer of DTCC Digital Assets, said in a statement. "By using smart contracts to automate the full range of collateral operations, we enable complex trade execution across markets in real-time at any time, even in volatile conditions." "This platform is unique in that we’ve created something that’s more open, flexible, dynamic, and comprehensive than any previous digital collateral initiative," said Nadine Chakar, global head of DTCC Digital Assets. The initiative comes as tokenization of traditional financial instruments such as bonds, funds and other traditional investments has become one of the hottest use cases for blockchain technology. Multiple financial heavyweights like BlackRock, CME Group and Fidelity have thrown their hat in the ring pursuing benefits such as operational efficiencies, speedier settlements and increased transparency compared to using traditional financial plumbing. DTCC will showcase the platform’s capabilities at the "The Great Collateral Experiment" event on April 23, where industry participants will test how tokenized assets can be mobilized across markets. The company said it also plans to engage with regulators and industry leaders to establish global standards for tokenized collateral.

Title: Bitcoin ETFs Could See $3B in Q2 Inflows Even Without Price Recovery, Says Analyst

The spot bitcoin ETFs saw sizable inflows in the first quarter despite the lame price action and at least one analyst sees the next three months as even bigger even if the prices don't recover. “Even if current market conditions persist in the second quarter, we are seeing strong traction from financial advisors and institutional investors," said Juan Leon, senior investment strategist at Bitwise (whose BITB is among the bitcoin ETFs). "While retail interest is weak due to the fixation on price action, professional investors are recognizing the global adoption momentum spurred by the Trump administration’s embrace of bitcoin, and many are seeing these market conditions as an opportunity to start or increase an allocation," Leon added. The ETFs saw over $1 billion in inflows in the first quarter of the year despite a challenging macro situation that sent the S&P 500 Index into its biggest quarterly loss since 2022 and bitcoin's 13% plunge. Leon expects inflows to be even stronger in the second quarter — as much as $3 billion or even more as wirehouse platforms unlock and legislative policy progresses. ETF inflows possibly less than meets the eye The $1 billion in first quarter net flows — and whatever the second quarter brings — doesn't necessarily reflect investor interest in buying the bitcoin dip. That's because of the so-called basis trade (also known as cash-and-carry). In this, institutional players buy the spot bitcoin ETF while shorting CME bitcoin futures, picking up yield without exposure to price movement. That yield was well into the double-digits in late 2024 and remained nicely above the risk-free rate throughout much of the first quarter. It's collapsed to the 5% area of late, suggesting arbitrage-related ETF inflows may dry up. Back to bull case: It's still early “While a favorable price environment would certainly be a boost, it's important to remember that adoption of spot bitcoin ETFs by these groups is still in its infancy," said Nate Geraci, president of the ETF Store, who is also bullish on the outlook for inflows throughout the rest of the year.. "As they grow more comfortable allocating to bitcoin, this should provide a meaningful tailwind for inflows,” he added.., While many institutions have indeed already made their first allocations into bitcoin in the past year, it represents only a small fraction of ETF investment, with most of the money still coming from retail investors — something recently noted by BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, whose IBIT is the asset-gathering leader among the spot ETFs. The more favorable regulatory stance toward the industry, not to mention the government’s own potential allocation into bitcoin, however, means that ratio could soon shift significantly. During an ETF conference in Las Vegas earlier this month, a survey showed that 57% of advisors plan on increasing their allocations into crypto ETFs this year as crypto has lost its “reputational risk” attribute among advisors. The view that bitcoin could serve as a “safe haven” in times of an economic decline, which investors remain anxious about, could also boost confidence in the asset, especially as fears of a potential recession grow. “If we see continued rate cut expectations, signs of economic uncertainty, or deepening fears of a potential recession in the US, Bitcoin’s role as 'digital gold' will likely support additional inflows,” said David Siemer, CEO of Wave Digital Assets. “While some short-term traders may rotate out if price weakness persists, long-term players will continue to keep inflows strong, especially as institutional adoption takes off and drives demand throughout the year."

Title: Timeline to COVID Tyranny – The Year 2019 and the Coming Storm
URL: https://www.globalresearch.ca/timeline-covid-tyranny-year-2019-coming-storm/5883286

Appreciating the full impact of the covid “shock and awe” campaign requires an understanding of not only the extensive planning that went into constructing the massive pandemic machine but also an awareness of how today’s healthcare management systems are being exploited to funnel trillions of dollars into the coffers of the world’s banker barons, pharmaceutical industry, and global ruling elites. We should not underestimate the windfall that has accrued to financial institutions (publicly traded and private banks, brokerage houses, investment firms, wealthy individuals, and family dynasties) from the healthcare sector of the securities markets. In the US alone, national health expenditures (NHE) — that is, total spending on healthcare and related activities — constitute the largest sector of the US economy. Last year, NHE was more than $5 trillion, or 17.7% of the US gross domestic product (GDP). By 2032, NHE are projected to rise to $7.7 trillion, or 19.7% of GDP. In other words, “disease” has replaced war as the primary money-spinner of the US — and the globe. The titans who control the nation’s politicians and the economy’s purse strings, including the details and direction of monetary and fiscal policy, need to create lengthy, large-scale health crises in order to keep their drowning-in-red-ink financial systems afloat. Manufactured pandemics have become mammoth investment opportunities that increase the wealth of these billionaires and further consolidate their power. The covid phenomenon itself cannot be fully comprehended without understanding the behind-the-scenes, un-televised, unprecedented economic collapse of 2019–2020 that threatened the entire global financial system. In the words of David A. Hughes, author of COVID-19 — Psychological Operations and the War for Technocracy, “This was not to be just any recession, however. This was, potentially, to be a system-destroying recession.” In September 2019, world markets were faced with an emergency debt crisis that popped up in formerly (mostly) liquid markets — namely, money markets, repurchase agreement (repo) markets, and foreign exchange (FX) markets. A crisis in the US repo market saw the secured overnight lending rate briefly hit 10% (versus its prior 2019 rate of 2%–3%), prompting the Federal Reserve to step in and begin dumping hundreds of billions of dollars a week into Wall Street’s trading firms. That repo loan operation, effectively a Wall Street bailout program, started September 17 and over the next six months came to more than $9 trillion in cumulative loans made at super-cheap borrowing rates. John Titus, a lawyer by training who, ever since the pandemic, has been applying his forensic skills to rooting out banking fraud, suggests that the Federal Reserve loan activity led to the decision to put BlackRock’s “Dealing with the next downturn” plan into action. Curiously, that white paper, whose central tenet is the “going direct” plan, was written by four BlackRock investment officers even before the World Health Organization (WHO) had declared the pandemic in March 2020. All of this suggests that the covid crisis was timed to coincide with the emergency debt crisis the world markets were facing. It looks like Western governments, at the beck and call of the big banks, instigated an operation to stem the cataclysmic economic landslide, bail out large investors, and proactively install a security infrastructure to control the inevitable social disorder that would result from this global catastrophe. Put another way, without an external threat like a “killer virus,” without the Covid-19 smokescreen, this massive financial collapse and historic wealth transfer would be seen for what it was: colossal theft by the ruling aristocracy of financial fraudsters. As I wrote in my January 2, 2023, article for Off-Guardian, “That’s the coup: global hyperinflation to vaporize the assets of the masses and the states in order to hand over public assets to private investors. This allows the ruling class to mop up properties (bankrupted small businesses, foreclosed homes, etc.) in order to stake limitless claims on everything in the world.” And, as John Titus wrote in his Summary — Going Direct Reset: “In a nutshell, the arrival of the 2020 pandemic was about as accidental as an assassination. The pandemic narrative is nothing but a cover story to conceal from the public what in reality is the biggest asset transfer ever.” Click here to read the timeline. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article.
