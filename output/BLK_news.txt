Daniel Erb became a corporate landlord kind of by accident. It started in 2020, when he received his first bonus as an investment banker. It was more money than he was used to. He wanted to invest in real estate, so he called his cousin, a research analyst at BlackRock, for advice. As they talked over options, his cousin showed him a striking chart of the number of "housing starts" in the U.S. since 1950 (basically the number of new houses and apartments built each year). It showed that the last 10 years had the fewest starts since the 1960s, even though the U.S. population was now much larger. Loading... It was a full decade of underinvestment. They focused on single-family homes — the classic house with a yard, often in the suburbs. "I'm a millennial," says Erb. "I've always envisioned having a home." But none of his friends had bought a house yet. Neither had he. Contemplating this lack of new houses and rising demand from millennials like him, he saw "a big opportunity … something that I was willing to spend my career on." So Erb and his cousin raised money from investors, bought homes in places like the Chatham-Arch neighborhood in Indianapolis (which was affordable, had a growing population and was benefiting from redevelopment), and rented them out — presumably to people who wanted a house with a yard but couldn't afford to buy one. Erb says it was a profitable business. He was not the first New York finance person to profit from single-family rentals across the United States. The private equity firm Blackstone (commonly confused with BlackRock) more or less invented this buy-to-rent strategy in 2012, under the moniker Invitation Homes. It's now a public company valued at more than $18 billion. The response to this development — of Wall Street buying Main Street, or at least some of its cul-de-sacs — has been bipartisan, populist and patriotic condemnation. Both JD Vance and Kamala Harris called for bans on these corporate landlords. Since houses tend to rise in value over time, homeownership has been a primary way that middle-class families build wealth. But now private equity was outbidding aspiring homeowners, making it more expensive to buy a home and pocketing the appreciation in home values. Even some of Erb's friends told him they thought he was making homes unaffordable. "Nothing that has stuck with me or made me second-guess what I'm doing," he says. He wasn't responsible for the decade of underinvestment; he felt they were giving young couples the option to live in a house without breaking their bank account. "But, yeah, very emotional conversations." Now that these institutional investors have been buying and renting out houses for more than a decade, researchers have had time to study their impact. And they've found a surprising nuance. These investors can and do make homeownership harder to attain, just as their critics claim. But by providing rentals, they also make neighborhoods more affordable and more diverse. They are diversifying the suburbs. When institutional investors first started buying single-family homes, the U.S. government laid out the welcome mat. Before the Great Recession, major investors hadn't had much interest in the suburbs. In the early 2000s, a firm called Redbrick Partners tried buy-to-rent. It ultimately abandoned the effort. Unlike in an apartment building, its leadership noted, where corporate management is common, fixing faucets and other maintenance were much less efficient when dealing with geographically dispersed homes. But during the Great Recession — just before the decline of new starts in Erb's chart — the U.S. had a glut of single-family homes in foreclosure. Many were auctioned off en masse, including by the federal government, which organized auctions for investors like Blackstone and even provided a $1 billion loan guarantee to encourage Blackstone to buy. This allowed private equity firms (which raise money from wealthy families, pension funds and other organizations to seek out profits, often by buying private companies) and real estate investors to efficiently and cheaply buy, say, a dozen similar homes located in the same Phoenix suburb. This solved two big problems for these institutional investors. It reduced the "search costs" of finding suitable homes (often starter homes with three bedrooms), and it allowed them to buy similar homes clustered in one area (which ameliorated the dispersed-faucets problem). Blackstone then introduced a financial product that supercharged the buy-to-rent sector: the rent-backed security. It was a bond, or IOU. Investors bought them, providing Blackstone with more money to buy and renovate homes. In exchange, investors were entitled to a cut of future rent payments. Wall Street could now buy homes by paying with the rent they would collect in the future. Per the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, the number of homes owned by Blackstone and similar firms increased from almost nothing in 2010 to around 400,000 by 2021. This is around when Erb and his cousin started buying homes. The batch auctions were long gone. But Erb says new technology allows companies like his to have a geographically dispersed portfolio of homes. The universality of listing platforms such as Redfin and Zillow keeps search costs down. Products like Ring cameras allow potential tenants to tour properties without being shown around by an agent. And software like Zoom has made it easier for them, like other executives, to manage a remote workforce. In 2012, many government officials had welcomed firms like Blackstone into the housing market because they worried about abandoned houses and saw rental conversions as a win. Today, though, institutional investors compete with middle-class families for starter homes. Is that why homeownership has gotten more expensive? As Kamala Harris and JD Vance were calling for bans on corporate landlords, Konhee Chang was a Ph.D. student in economics. Born in Korea, Chang had always rented while living in the U.S. but never the "quintessential house that I think of when I think about an American house," with a front yard and a backyard. He wanted to know why there were so few rentals in the suburbs and who would live there if renting was an option. Chang realized these investors' buy-to-rent strategy provided an ideal case study of what happens when more rentals are available. If someone had built new homes to rent out, that would increase the supply of homes, changing the neighborhood. But since they converted homes into rentals, only one variable had changed, like in an experiment. So Chang assembled and analyzed data on neighborhoods before and after corporate landlords showed up, including demographic data on the residents. His biggest finding? Institutional investors were reducing segregation. When private equity rented out homes, the new tenants tended to be lower income than the prior owners and more likely to be young and nonwhite. "I think I was most surprised by the fact that the effect was so sharp and immediate," says Chang, who has since earned his Ph.D. from UC Berkeley. He took it as a sign that these families really wanted to live in these areas but were prevented by the lack of rentals and their inability to get a mortgage. This is particularly notable because one of the most important economics findings of the past decade is the impact on children's development and career prospects of their hometown and neighborhood. (You can listen to a Planet Money episode on moving to opportunity here.) Suburban neighborhoods are not inherently better than rural or urban areas. But another study, for example, showed that single-family rentals in North Carolina served "as a pathway for access to high-performing public schools" for economically disadvantaged children. These results did not turn Chang into a cheerleader for private equity. He's too careful a scholar, and his results hold for rentals in general, regardless of whether the landlord is Invitation Homes or a couple down the street. Plus, he did not investigate other criticisms of corporate ownership. (For example, a Bloomberg investigation in 2013 found that Magnetar Capital LLC became the largest landlord in Huber Heights, Ohio, and then pushed for lower assessments of its properties' value. If it had succeeded, it would have been the largest property tax cut in county history, reducing the school district's budget by $800,000 a year.) Most of all, Chang found that the buy-to-rent strategy was hurting the middle class. Creating rentals aided lower-income families and nudged rents down. But reducing the supply of homes available for sale also pushed home prices up, hurting families on the cusp of homeownership. Erb says he feels good about the rental service they provide. (In 2024, he and his cousin teamed up with a veteran real estate investor to co-found a larger investment firm, Strand Capital.) But he agrees this trade-off exists. "There's always gonna be a cost and a benefit," he says. But the bigger problem for housing affordability, he adds, is that "we just haven't built enough [homes] to keep up with the population growth and household formation." "People get really riled up about this idea of private equity coming in and buying the block," says Daryl Fairweather. "I think they are kind of the boogeyman though." That's because institutional investors own a very small slice of single-family homes in the United States. As the chief economist at the real estate platform Redfin, Fairweather says investors purchase about 17% of homes. But most of those purchases are by mom-and-pop investors, not big firms like Blackstone. Institutional investors just don't own enough homes to be the main culprit for high home prices. In fact, Fairweather sees some societal benefits of institutional investors. Unlike with mom-and-pop landlords, it's easier to regulate large corporate landlords and check whether they are, say, following the Fair Housing Act. Plus, in places like Silicon Valley, where politicians are trying to address housing crises by encouraging the development of duplexes and triplexes, profit-driven institutional investors are a potential boon, since they're more likely to turn suburban homes into duplexes. And in areas with more open land, like the suburbs near Denver, institutional investors are building new housing specifically to rent out. Think cookie-cutter homes, perhaps with a dog park or pool. "I think that we should embrace investors who want to make those kinds of investments," Fairweather says. Still, she thinks middle-class families are right to worry about private equity displacing them from the housing market. She worries about fewer families achieving homeownership and gaining control over this intimate part of their lives, which has also been the dominant path to building wealth in America. But a ban? As an economist, she hates bans. If politicians succeed in banning corporate landlords, perhaps by making it illegal to own more than 300 homes, she suspects we'd see lots of 300-home companies replacing Blackstone — without doing anything to increase homeownership among the middle class. Instead, she advocates for policies that will incentivize and allow developers to build more housing. The trade-off caused by single-family rentals — that they benefit some low-income renters but hurt some aspiring homebuyers — is "because we are restricting the number of homes that can be built in neighborhoods." Many desirable neighborhoods are zoned so that it's impossible to build the duplexes or apartment buildings that would make them accessible to low-income families. Many prosperous towns block the building of new single-family homes, often at the behest of current homeowners who don't want to deal with construction or who want to restrict supply and boost their home's value. The best way to stick it to Blackstone and private equity, to prevent Wall Street firms from profiting off the housing crisis, is to make it easier to build more homes. As for Daniel Erb, even though he has spent his career responding to the dearth of suburban homes, betting on our collective underinvestment in American dream properties, he might appreciate that too. He says he doesn't own a home, in part because he often travels to the towns where his company buys homes. And he says he's not buying for himself at today's prices.

Title: Private Prisons: An Exceptionally Niche Asset Class Meets It Moment

Time Published: 2025-09-09T10:22:57Z

© 2025 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy It’s certainly a niche asset class. But one that’s rapidly expanding. The ongoing, record-breaking expansion of the nation’s immigrant detention capacity — due to an expedited mass deportation push that’s been the subject of significant protests, legal rulings and due process complaints — has made private prisons a burgeoning business during the start of the second Trump administration. Industry stalwarts GEO Group and CoreCivic, which have substantial experience in prison operations and a nationwide portfolio of carceral real estate, have seen the coming flood of federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) funding as part of a series of “unprecedented growth opportunities,” said GEO Group Chairman George C. Zoley during the firm’s latest earnings call in August. Roughly $45 billion has been earmarked for detention through September 2029 via the recently passed One Big Beautiful Bill. ICE plans to double its detention capacity to nearly 110,000 by the end of this year, which, at full capacity, would make the agency’s wards the 20th largest incarcerated populations in the world. For the private prison industry, this opportunity is one they claim they’re singularly suited to meet. “Our decades-long history of constructing facilities for government use has given us a marketable portfolio of existing, ready-to-activate, high-quality capacity that we view as ideally suited to meet ICE’s immediate needs,” said Ryan Gustin, CoreCivic’s senior director of public affairs, in a statement sent to Commercial Observer. GEO Group declined to respond to repeated requests for comment. This moment highlights just how these two firms have continuously evolved their operations. The methods by which these companies finance and construct facilities have changed over time, as shifting funding streams and priorities of different administrations — as well as advocacy campaigns and waves of public pushback — have changed the reality on the ground. Generally speaking, the contracts that GEO Group or CoreCivic would get from the federal government have been for operations and management. It’s the recurring revenue fee for running private prison sites. Construction funding comes from a number of sources, which have changed for these firms over time. Bob Libal, a criminal legal reform and immigrant rights advocate in Austin, Texas, had more experience with these companies during their initial wave of expansion in the early 2000s under the George W. Bush administration. During that period, especially in Texas, there was a lot of public financing around private prisons that utilized municipal revenue bonds. During the twilight of the Obama administration, the federal government decided to end federal contracts with private prisons, sending a memo to the Bureau of Prisons instructing the federal agency to decline to renew contracts. During Joe Biden’s administration, the government was instructed to phase out funding to private prisons, but continued to use them for a growing population of detained immigrants. “I think the liability they’ve experienced is that at different times in their corporate history, if the demand for private prisons decreases, then they have empty facilities sitting there, right?” said Shar Habibi, research and policy director of In the Public Interest, a nonprofit that has advocated against private prisons. “That’s not good.” During the first Trump administration, a number of advocacy groups challenged the larger financial institutions — including Bank of America, Wells Fargo and SunTrust (now part of Truist) — that backed these private prison firms in a sustained campaign between 2016 and 2019. Called Families Belong Together, in response to policies that separated detained families, the coalition sought financial pressure points. At the time, the companies were structured as REITs, and needed to distribute most of their taxable income to investors annually, making them dependent on financing, term loans and revolving credit facilities for new construction, said Dov Baum, director of American Friends Service Committee’s Action Center for Corporate Accountability. The allied groups then identified and successfully pressured banks and financial groups to stop funding private prisons. Since then, GEO Group and CoreCivic have dropped their REIT status, which means they aren’t as reliant on external loans, and don’t have to be as transparent about financial records. By and large, the current funding GEO Group and CoreCivic utilizes is administered by Alter Domus, a private lender whose funding sources are much more opaque. Both companies have in-house planning and design capacity as well as in-house construction experience. CoreCivic boasts it can achieve 25 percent cost savings and finish a new facility in 18 months or less. But the recent wave of funding for immigrant detention facilities has been overly focused on speed, which has altered the way vendors have competed for federal dollars, and the facilities they are building or, in most cases, reopening. The Trump administration’s rush to accommodate higher immigrant detention figures has meant a focus on reactivating closed facilities or constructing temporary tent structures on federal land, particularly on Army bases. A number of new contractors, such as disaster-relief providers and other firms like GothamsLLC and Deployed Resources, which sometimes lack direct prison management experience, have been contracted to rapidly erect tents on federal sites. Governors in Indiana, Florida, Louisiana and Nebraska have offered up shuttered state prisons or state-run detention camps, according to data gathered by the nonprofit Detention Watch network. A number of military bases — such as Indiana’s Camp Atterbury, Fort Bliss in Texas, Guantanamo Bay in Cuba and Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst in New Jersey — are being used to expand capacity. The haste has led to wasted efforts. The “Alligator Alcatraz” project in the Florida Everglades, funded in part by Federal Management Emergency Agency funds meant for asylum seekers and migrants, was recently ordered closed by a federal judge because the rapidly assembled project skipped over a federal environmental review process, among other issues. (As of press time, the facility remained open following an appeals court ruling staying the judge’s decision.) But the big contractors are still seeing significant revenue opportunities. In many cases, older, underutilized or closed facilities owned by CoreCivic or GEO Group are being reactivated, turning empty and idle facilities into new profit centers. Roughly 20 such facilities existed between both companies at the start of Trump’s second term, due in part to sentencing reforms that shrunk prison populations. Meanwhile, some big names are taking stakes — albeit, for many of them, minor ones — in owner-operators like GEO Group. BlackRock, for instance, has a significant stake in GEO Group. But that’s via its investments in index funds tied to the stock market, not to any particular effort by the firm to single out the private prison company. BlackRock, Vanguard, Goldman Sachs, State Street Global Advisers and Guggenheim Partners didn’t respond to requests to gain more insight into their own holdings of GEO Group or CoreCivic stock. Geo Group’s Zoley specifically called out the “intrinsic value of our owned real estate assets,” and expects all the firm’s shuttered prisons to be reactivated by the end of the year. CoreCivic purchased the Farmville Detention Center in Virginia for $67 million, which is already accepting detainees, and made substantial progress reactivating three facilities in the spring of this year, with the activation team preparing for additional contracting activity. These reopenings can attract significant protest and pushback from local and state governments, as well as prisoner and immigrant rights groups, over complaints about poor food and lax oversight that in some cases has left prisoners seriously injured. The California City detention center outside of Los Angeles, which CoreCivic reopened in June, raised the ire of local activists and leaders; the state had tried to ban private prisons until the action was judged unconstitutional in 2023. The move to reopen the infamous Leavenworth prison in Kansas via an expedited process known as a letter contract, angered local officials, who filed a lawsuit in opposition. The potential, however, has already shifted the financial performance of these firms. GEO Group’s net income during the first half of 2025 was $48.6 million, a stark turnaround from the first half of 2024, where the firm lost $9.8 million. CoreCivic saw net income jump 103.4 percent in the second quarter versus the same period last year, hitting $38.5 million. These reopened facilities are predicted to make an immediate financial impact. For instance, GEO Group resumed services at the 1,000-bed Delaney Hall in Newark, N.J., starting this year — despite active efforts to sue by the city, which alleged improper permits — and it’s projected to generate $60 million in annualized revenue when it hits full capacity. “There are some people who say that private prisons are better than public prisons because they’re easily closed, because there isn’t pressure from public sector unions,” said Libal, the immigrant rights advocate in Texas. “But my argument is, they’re always trying to reopen, right?” Read the latest edition of the Commercial Observer online!

Title: Nasdaq President Seeks SEC Approval To Tokenize All Assets On Exchange

With companies like BlackRock driving significant growth in the tokenization space, American stock exchange Nasdaq is poised to take advantage of this development by working with US authorities to make it easier for tokenized securities to be traded. In a recent LinkedIn post, Nasdaq President Tal Cohen emphasized the potential of integrating tokenization and blockchain technology with traditional market infrastructure. He pointed out that this fusion could provide substantial advantages to issuers, investors, and the broader economy by reducing friction in transactions, speeding up settlement times, automating processes, and enhancing capital and collateral management efficiencies. As part of this effort, Nasdaq has submitted a filing to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to enable the trading of tokenized securities on its platform. In his remarks, Cohen acknowledged the potential of blockchain technology to introduce new post-trade processes, modernize proxy voting, and create programmable methods for managing corporate actions. The rise of decentralized finance (DeFi) has offered valuable insights into how core financial services—such as lending, trading, and clearing—can operate differently to deliver value. However, Cohen also highlighted the risks associated with rapid advancements. Cohen stressed the importance of embedding governance and investor protection from the outset to ensure that the benefits of innovation can be fully realized. Nasdaq’s recent filing is seen as a pivotal step in its journey to incorporate digital asset technology into the US equities markets responsibly. The proposal aims to integrate new capabilities into the existing financial system, further enhancing the efficiency and trustworthiness of these markets. If the SEC approves Nasdaq’s proposal, it would represent the first instance of tokenized securities being traded on a major US stock exchange, marking a significant milestone in the integration of blockchain-based settlement into the national market system. Notably, Coinbase, the largest US cryptocurrency exchange, has also sought the regulatory agency’s approval for offering “tokenized equities” to its users, while major banks like Bank of America and Citi have expressed interest in exploring tokenized assets. Once Nasdaq’s proposal is in place and the necessary infrastructure from the central clearing agency is operational, investors could potentially buy shares on Nasdaq that settle in token form, all without altering the current processes for order routing, pricing, surveillance, or reporting. Nasdaq anticipates that US investors may witness the first token-settled trades by the end of the third quarter of 2026, contingent upon the readiness of the Depository Trust Company’s infrastructure.

Title: From Mexico to Ireland: ‘You have to be very resilient - but this is an amazing country’

Ana Garmilla (32) and her Irish partner were able to buy a house together six weeks ago, something she doesn’t believe would have ever been possible in her native Mexico. “We wouldn’t have had the Help to Buy scheme in Mexico, and that was a game changer for us,” she says. Even when accounting for the difference in price for properties in Ireland and Mexico, Garmilla still thinks that she would have never been able to afford to buy a house back home, as the government there don’t offer that kind of help. “I think the Government [in Ireland] is taking a few steps to invite people to buy houses.” Garmilla was born and raised in Puebla, a city in central Mexico. She studied Communications Sciences at university then briefly worked for a local newspaper before becoming a civil servant. By the time she was 24 she was the head of communications and citizens’ affairs in the Department of Infrastructure for the Mexican state of Puebla. However, at 27, Garmilla lost her job as “when you work for the government [in Mexico] and a new administration comes in, you might be out, especially if you have a good job”. At about the same time, Garmilla’s father, who she was very close to, died. Her sister spotted a business English course in Dublin and pushed her to take a career break to study and travel, but Garmilla was very unsure about what to do. Then one day her sister gave her a voucher for a one-way ticket to Dublin. She booked a flight to Dublin for March as she wanted to see the St Patrick’s Day parade. [ ‘In Ireland I started missing the sun very soon, but I knew it was the place I wanted to be in’Opens in new window ] Garmilla landed in Dublin on March 12th, 2020, as Ireland went into lockdown. “Everything was empty. The airports were empty. There was like three people on the plane. It was very surreal.” At first, life in Dublin felt like a big step backwards for Garmilla. “I was living with other Mexicans in an overpriced apartment. Back in Mexico I was living in my own apartment. I had a brand-new car.” Living with fellow Mexicans, Garmilla felt that she wasn’t improving her English, so she found an Irish family in Blackrock, Co Dublin, looking for an au pair, and moved in with them. She ended up living with and working for two families. “That’s where I learned that an Irish person is a very kind and lovely person. I remember for example, if they met somebody rude, they would say, ‘yeah they might be having a bad day’, and I would never have thought of it that way. Where I come from, if somebody was rude to you, you’ll be pissed off and you won’t put yourself in their shoes.” Irish weather took some time to get used to. One day during her first summer in Ireland the father of the family she was working for told her: “It’s a great day out there – we can’t waste it indoors.” Garmilla was confused by this and thought, “He must be one of those overly positive or deeply religious people, grateful for every single day they’re alive,” as she didn’t think the weather at the time was that remarkable. When she experienced her first Irish winter later that year, she began to understand his perspective a lot better. “I learned to make the most out of summer. It’s still tough. Not even the weather, but it being dark at 4pm in the afternoon. I can’t get over that.“ I’m trying to make my own community here with work. It’s not easy During this time, Garmilla met her partner Bryan McQuillan (36). “We met online because it was Covid. We couldn’t even meet each other for a few months because of the restrictions. I was living in Dublin and he was living in Drogheda – at some point he had to come to Dublin for work, and that was how we met.” She described him thus: “Kind, very friendly, very open. I think that Mexican and Irish cultures are very similar. We’re very friendly and family-orientated and I like that.” [ ‘Being pregnant here has made me appreciate the good things Ireland has to offer’Opens in new window ] Garmilla enjoyed her English course and made many friends while doing it. During this time she began to fall in love with life in Ireland. “I realised that Dublin was a capital with the charm and pace of a village – everyone knows each other here and that wouldn’t be the case back home.” When her course finished, she decided to try to find a job here. “I felt like I had to start from scratch. I worked in a pub and in a Volkswagen dealership. They tried to sponsor my visa but it was denied twice.” At 29, Garmilla decided to move back to Mexico. “Ireland is a very expensive country to survive in, and I could only work 20 hours a week on my visa.” But then, the unexpected happened – McQuillan came back to Mexico with her and proposed. “We got married in Mexico and we didn’t have a party or anything because we just decided to start saving money for the house instead. We signed the papers and went for a nice dinner.” The couple came back from Mexico, and Garmilla got a job with the Fórsa trade union. Today the couple live in Drogheda. “We tried to find a place in Dublin and then I saw that for the same three-bedroom house I would have to pay at least €100,000 more, and then I thought if I do have kids I don’t have anybody or any network here. The only network and family we have is his family, so why put myself under that financial pressure?” Garmilla is very close to McQuillan’s family, and admits she “wouldn’t be able to live here if they weren’t. They are the only people I can go to if Bryan isn’t here.” Though she made great friends on her English course, she says most of them have since moved away. “I’m trying to make my own community here with work. It’s not easy, but I suppose I left everything back home, so missing your friend from here is not as tough as missing friends you’ve had for your whole life.” When asked whether she would recommend moving to Dublin to her friends back home she said: “I don’t think it’s for everyone in terms of weather. And I think you have to be very resilient – but it’s an amazing country.” We would like to hear from people who have moved to Ireland in the past 10 years.

Title: The guidance counsellor: ‘I think we’re overly educated, but perhaps not skilled enough’

David Drury is a guidance counsellor and head of the guidance and counselling department at Blackrock College. A belief that students must study for a degree is the “predominant mindset” among parents and students, he says. “The CAO dominates the guidance counsellor-student/parent conversation from the end of transition year,” he says. “Then it leads to the alignment and the order of preferencing and they get very caught up in that. They kind of ignore level 7 and level 6. It doesn’t get very much attention.” Drury says “unfortunately”, when it comes to planning what students will do after the Leaving Cert, “the majority would rather follow the high pointer [course] rather than the course that they’re genuinely interested in, or their interests are aligned to. That is the mindset. And it is the mindset of parents. The way they deem it is, the higher the points, the better the course, and the better the opportunities. “It’s not just a south Dublin thing. It’s national. Parents are tuned into the CAO and the points. They’re not tuned into the wonderful level 6 and 7 that can bring you to the very same level 8.” He believes there’s a huge element of degree snobbery at the moment. “I think we’re overly educated, but perhaps not skilled enough.” “Today, apprenticeships can bring you to a level 10,” Drury continues, explaining how some of his past students have taken up apprenticeships in aircraft maintenance, and finance. “Apprenticeships have expanded into new sectors like ICT [information and communications technology], finance, insurance, renewable energies – massive growth there – engineering, logistics, hospitality, farming”, he says. “It’s education with a payslip.” He believes the apprenticeship route is not being “advertised enough in schools, and in the media”. Students and parents should consider the “wonderful routes” that are available to them, he says. Tertiary degrees are another route, he suggests. “Some remain open and will remain open until September,” he says. “It’s a different route with the same degree”, he says explaining how they differ from the CAO. “You start out in an ETB [education and training board]. Classes are small. And from there, meeting the requirements of the course, you will graduate from your ETB in one to two years, and you will join the partner university. There you will go on to finish your degree. You will leave with a level 7 or a level 8, exactly the same as CAO students.” Drury explains that students get “awards for every year you complete”. He makes the distinction between a post-Leaving Cert course (PLC) and a tertiary degree. PLCs offer potential “eligibility to get into a college, but it’s not guaranteed ... a tertiary degree is guaranteed as long as you progress and get the grades”. He says parents “could really help by having that discussion, shortlisting those courses, noting the progression routes and the linked university, noting the deadlines”. Most PLCs, Drury says, are one-year duration. “Very practical, work experience. You can achieve a level 5, a level 6, as long as you reach your grades. And then from there you apply through the QQI [Quality and Qualifications, Ireland] links to the university course that you want to go on to ... Degree offers depend on your PLC results. It will depend on the demand for the course. And it will depend on any extra requirements.” He again cautions to keep an eye out for deadlines. Some students go straight into work, which Drury says is a great idea, but recommends, “because you’re at such a young age, try many different roles. Job hop, or ‘jobdate’, because you’re young. And try them in different countries, if you’re brave. The gap year is not a chill and Netflix ... You need to be motivated. You need to have a goal. You need to polish up your CV – parents could help with that. You need to get on your LinkedIn. “And you’ve got to reach out and network because no one else is going to do that for you.” Sign up to Classroom to College, our essential newsletter to navigating the Leaving Cert for parents, guardians and students Join The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to date Your expert guide to navigating the Leaving Cert and choosing the right study options at university and further education © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

David Drury is a guidance counsellor and head of the guidance and counselling department at Blackrock College. A belief that students must study for a degree is the “predominant mindset” among parents and students, he says. “The CAO dominates the guidance counsellor-student/parent conversation from the end of transition year,” he says. “Then it leads to the alignment and the order of preferencing and they get very caught up in that. They kind of ignore level 7 and level 6. It doesn’t get very much attention.” Drury says “unfortunately”, when it comes to planning what students will do after the Leaving Cert, “the majority would rather follow the high pointer [course] rather than the course that they’re genuinely interested in, or their interests are aligned to. That is the mindset. And it is the mindset of parents. The way they deem it is, the higher the points, the better the course, and the better the opportunities. “It’s not just a south Dublin thing. It’s national. Parents are tuned into the CAO and the points. They’re not tuned into the wonderful level 6 and 7 that can bring you to the very same level 8.” He believes there’s a huge element of degree snobbery at the moment. “I think we’re overly educated, but perhaps not skilled enough.” “Today, apprenticeships can bring you to a level 10,” Drury continues, explaining how some of his past students have taken up apprenticeships in aircraft maintenance, and finance. “Apprenticeships have expanded into new sectors like ICT [information and communications technology], finance, insurance, renewable energies – massive growth there – engineering, logistics, hospitality, farming”, he says. “It’s education with a payslip.” He believes the apprenticeship route is not being “advertised enough in schools, and in the media”.

Dear friends, Welcome to the September oh-so-totally back-to-school issue of the Mutual Fund Observer! We’re glad you’re here. I’ve got the privilege of teaching an Honors section of Introduction to the Liberal Arts for the first time in a quarter century. It’s a delight and a terror. Many of my students, like many of you, start with a mistaken idea of what “the liberal arts” are. They are not “the fusty old white guy stuff that they made me sit through until I could get into my major classes.” (sigh) At their simplest, the liberal arts are all the skills you need to learn in order to make a change in the world; the skills needed to put your principles into practice. My students are learning to listen, respect the opinions of others, state them fairly, and respond to them respectfully, and with as much force as the available evidence permits. They’re learning that they have to earn the right to have their conclusions heard. They’ll learn a bit about their ethical responsibilities when it comes to advancing a cause, a bit about research, a bit about artificial intelligence and the lure of cognitive off-loading … and a bit about apples because it’s fall and I love apples. The Augustana College Quad and Activities Fair, 9/6/25 They’ll also read Machiavelli, a singularly excellent translation of The Prince by Tim Parks. And you want to know a secret? They’re going to get into it because about 90% of what you’ve heard about “college kids these days” is crap: they’re incredibly bright and willing to speak up, they have a far greater comfort with differences of thought and appearance than I ever did, they’re deeply skeptical of AI, and are ready to go to war against people who disconnect from the world around them by sinking (or syncing) into phones and earbuds. On this, my 42nd iteration of autumn at Augustana, I’m as hopeful as ever, inspired by their strength and passion. Let’s see how this plays out. I’ll keep you informed. Lynn Bolin examines low-correlation alternatives in “BlackRock Systematic Multi-Strategy (BAMBX) versus BlackRock Tactical Opportunities (PCBAX),” seeking funds that can provide steady 5% returns with minimal correlation to traditional stocks and bonds. Using quantitative analysis and Portfolio Visualizer, he evaluates how these BlackRock funds performed during challenging periods like the COVID bear market and 2022’s dual stock-bond decline. Bolin ultimately favors BAMBX as part of a diversified low-risk sub-portfolio for volatile times ahead. His companion piece, “Preparing for an Inflection Point on Interest Rates,” responds to recent economic signals, including revised employment data, rising producer prices, and Fed Chair Powell’s Jackson Hole remarks about potential rate cuts. Drawing insights from Kenneth Rogoff’s “Our Dollar, Your Problem,” Lynn anticipates sustained financial volatility, with higher real interest rates and more frequent debt crises. He’s implementing a barbell bond strategy, shifting from short-term to intermediate-duration funds while upgrading to higher-quality bonds and adding inflation protection, preparing for what he sees as a fundamental shift away from the ultra-low rate environment of the past decade. Both essays reflect Lynn’s methodical preparation for increased economic uncertainty, combining rigorous quantitative analysis with strategic positioning for a changing interest rate environment. They’re worth your time. I share a Launch Alert for Franklin Multisector Income Fund, which debuted in the last week of August. The fund resonates with Lynn’s concern about finding investments that are insulated from the probable instability ahead, while at the same time offering the prospect of decent returns while we wait. The literature surrounding it got me thinking about the prudence of looking at income funds that were (a) successful and (b) determinedly isolated from the wobbles of the US market, which led us to … “Thinking more broadly: Bonds beyond vanilla,” in which we launch a systematic (i.e., MFO Premium-driven) search for income-oriented funds that are insulated from the local lunacy. A screen for funds that could invest flexibly, have made 4% or more over the past five years (had you noticed that core bond funds were underwater for the same period?), are uncorrelated with the US bond market, and qualify as MFO Great Owls (a sign of top 20% risk-adjusted returns across a range of examination periods). Sixteen such funds are available to regular investors, a combination of funds that we’ve written a lot about (RiverPark Strategic Income) and ones that we’d never heard of (Saba Closed-End Fund ETF). We give a snapshot of each and hope to profile a substantial number by year’s end. (If one particularly calls to you, drop me a note and I’ll move it up on the to-do list.) And The Shadow, as ever, tracks down a horde (perhaps a hoard) of industry developments, including a huge number of OEF-to-ETF conversions, two interesting reopenings, and the ongoing flight from funds grappling with climate change. (Pity.) Thing the first: inflation is likely to bite you in the butt sooner than later. Mostly self-inflicted wounds from federal initiatives on tariffs and immigration. Yes, I know, it hasn’t hit yet. That’s due to three short-term factors: people stocked up before Trump’s international goods and services tax took hold, companies have been absorbing the costs of tariffs (which inevitably reduce earnings), and earnings and low energy prices have masked the effects of price increases elsewhere. Goldman Sachs estimates that about 70% of the cost of tariffs will be eventually paid by US households, with the Tax Foundation estimating the cost in the form of higher prices at $1,300 per family. “This is like when you see a flood coming, the tsunami is coming in, and the water’s gone up two inches,” Robertson warned. (Eva Roytburg, “‘It’s like when you see the tsunami coming in’: Agricultural economists are sounding the alarm about produce prices doubling,” Fortune, 8/28/2025) The immigration piece (arresting hundreds of Hyundai workers, most recently) will follow the flow of crop harvests and commodity contracts; deportations have thinned the fields, import taxes have been slapped on a vast amount of produce, and producer contracts signed in January 2025 will be renegotiated at year’s end. Yet these consumers “don’t have a clue what’s going on,” Raymond Robertson, a labor economist at Texas A&M’s Bush School of Government who has advised U.S. agencies on trade and labor policy, told Fortune… The first wave of grocery-price increases will likely hit this winter. Robertson predicted produce prices could rise 50% to 100% by early next year as inventories clear and new contracts kick in. And unlike past decades, when Washington would quietly ease border enforcement to keep fields staffed, today’s political environment suggests no such check. (Fortune, 8/28/2025) Thing the second: market speculation reached an all-time high in August. That trading is manifested through two sorts of purchases: zero-day options and freakazoid ETFs. Speculative trading in U.S. equities has surged to historic highs, with retail investors driving activity in ultra-short-term derivatives… [zero-day] options now account for an average of 65% of total S&P 500 options volume in the third quarter of 2025, according to Tier 1 Alpha data shared by The Kobeissi Letter on August 23. For instance, on Thursday, the figure spiked to a record 69%, marking the highest level ever recorded. (Paul L, “Retail stock speculation hits record levels; Incoming market crash?” FinBold, 8/24/2025) Zero-day options allow you to make wild bets about events that need to happen today, and because they’re cheap, a little down can allow you to make a very large bet that has to be covered or cashed out within hours. Separately, the ETF industry has continued to spit out a collection of freakazoid crap. (It’s a technical term describing hardly imaginable opportunities to lose money which never should have seen the light of day; think “double reverse 24-hour Tesla” shares.) The riskiest niche funds have seen, collectively, $60 billion in inflows … almost none of it from institutional investors. Institutional investors make up two-thirds of the ETF market, but are virtually absent from these sorts of funds. “These strategies are incredibly volatile. They’re 99% owned by retail. There are no institutions allocating these strategies, but there’s billions of dollars coming into them,” he added. (Anna Gleason, “This under-the-radar ETF trend may be flashing a warning signal for the market,” CNBC, Aug 23 2025) How volatile? The YieldMax AI Option Income Strategy ETF is down 52% YTD (per Morningstar, as of 9/8/2025) while its derivative income peers are essentially at zero. Neither soaring prices nor feverish speculation portend a quiet end of the year, though we have no crystal ball. We do have the same suggestion as ever: get ahead of the crisis. Check your investment plan now, not when the howling begins. Recalibrate to a risk level you’re comfortable with. My Indolent Portfolio, at just 50% stocks, has returned a lovely 11.25% so far this year, which strikes me as entirely excellent for a low-drama, low ulcer strategy. Seafarer Capital announced that, effective August 28, 2025, Paul Espinosa was named the firm’s Co-Chief Investment Officer alongside Andrew Foster, its founder. Paul has been the Lead Portfolio Manager of the Seafarer Overseas Value Fund (our profile is here) since its inception (2016) and a Lead Portfolio Manager of the Seafarer Overseas Growth and Income Fund (since 2018). The remainder of the Value team is Mr. Foster and Brent Clayton. Seafarer has divided, thoughtfully, the responsibilities between the two: Mr. Espinosa’s role as risk management lead is reflected in the performance of Seafarer Value. It remains striking to us that, amid a revival of interest in emerging markets, the nine-year-old Seafarer Overseas Value Fund remains such a Star in the Shadows with just $125M AUM (though they’ve seen healthy and well-earned inflows in 2025). That’s against amazing raw and risk-adjusted performance, which earned it MFO Great Owl designation (top 20% risk-adjusted returns across multiple measurement periods) and Morningstar’s five-star and Silver ratings. How amazing? Over the past five years, SFVLX has had the fifth-highest raw returns, the highest Sharpe ratio among all diversified EM equity funds (fifth overall with the four higher being single-country funds), and the lowest Ulcer Index. Over the nine years since inception, its Sharpe ratio is #5 and Ulcer Index remains #1. What does that mean? In a high volatility asset class such as EM equities, a prudent risk manager is an investor’s most critical resource, and Mr. Espinosa has an almost unparalleled record in that regard. The Ulcer Index is a great measure of it. It factors in two values – how far a fund falls at its worst and how long it takes to recover – which together predict how many ulcers the fund will trigger. Of all diversified EM funds, Seafarer has offered the single smoothest ride over both the past 5- and 9-year periods. Put another way: there is SFVLX and then there are 274 bumpier rides available to you, of which at least 270 would earn you less for the privilege. That makes Mr. Espinosa’s promotion and assignment to the lead risk manager role sensible and appropriate. Congratulations. I aspire to match his 95 years rather more than his $95 billion. In particular, I envy his continuing mental acuity at 95. He continues to make sense and continues to read 500 pages a day, reputedly, from biographies and investing books to financial statements. His advice to students: “Read 500 pages like this every day. That’s how knowledge works. It builds up, like compound interest. All of you can do it, but I guarantee not many of you will do it.” The folks at Quartz continually admire a trait that few of his contemporaries manage: consistency. They write: What stands out at 95 is the throughline: temperament. Buffett ducked the dot-com bust by ignoring what he didn’t understand, then minted billions from Apple once he could frame it as a consumer staple. He bailed out Wall Street with checks that doubled as confidence votes — and collected billions in dividends and warrants for the trouble. He nearly skipped See’s Candies over a $5 million haggling gap, then used it to bankroll acquisitions for decades. For every Apple there’s a Dexter Shoe, but that’s the point: Fortune doesn’t require perfection, just patience and the temperament to keep compounding. John Conner sent out a provocative email, “Still ‘Investing’ in SNAXX?” (8/7/2025). Mr. Conner is an executive vice president at CrossingBridge and asked this question: Why settle for SNAXX when you really want the whole meal? SNAXX aka the Schwab Money Market Fund, along with “T-bill-and-chill” and other money market funds can be great for short-term cash needs, but investors have increasingly relied on these types of investments for their longer-term allocations. SNAXX are fine when you’re hungry…but you might be starving your portfolio. At CrossingBridge, we think there’s a better option where investors can still prioritize downside risk-management while trying to capture significantly more income. It is very clear that many Americans have noticed that bank savings accounts are the only game in town that guarantees you will lose money. My Old National Bank basic savings kicks out … ready? 0.01% interest in a world where prices are rising (that is, savings are devaluing) at 3% a year. Kiplinger’s reports that “investors have poured into low-risk money market funds” (7/2025) while Morgan Stanley’s annual money market report notes that folks have placed a record $7 trillion in money markets (Money Market Funds 2025 Outlook, 2/2025). They conclude that the trend toward money market, ultra-short-term bond, and high-yield money market funds has intensified since mid-2024 as traditional insured savings accounts have failed to keep pace with inflation or have offered yields below what can be safely achieved elsewhere. Enter CrossingBridge Ultra-Short Duration Fund. A really extensive analysis shared by CrossingBridge concludes that across a wide range of time windows and risk-return metrics, CBUDX is a stronger candidate for your strategic cash than a really good money market is. Curious, we ran a “strategic cash” search through MFO Premium’s huge data screener. What we found was that CrossingBridge and the funds it advises or sub-advises dominate the top of the list. CrossingBridge Ultra-Short Duration and RiverPark Short Term High Yield both clocked in with returns greater than 4% a year, maximum drawdowns of 0.1 – o.2% with a recovery time (that is, how long the 0.1 – 0.2% loss persisted before you were in the black again) of two months. Both funds qualify as MFO Great Owl funds for consistently top 20% risk-adjusted returns across various trailing periods. Bottom line: there is some money you have to be able to get right now, today, no delay. That’s “immediate cash.” Put that money in an insured checking account, knowing that you don’t mind if it shrinks a bit because you need 100% liquidity to … you know, buy groceries. “Strategic cash” is intended for situations where a brief delay (a day or two, perhaps a week) is acceptable, allowing for better yields or returns with minimal risk. “You’re gonna need those brakes replaced before the holidays” might be a strategic cash target. At least the research available to us suggests that a money market is better than a savings account for that role, and that the CrossingBridge / RiverPark funds are better than a money market. Only 23% of shareholders have voted on the conversion of Akre Fund to Akre Focus ETF as of our last contact with the adviser. Hmmm … the conversion will likely lower your expenses and your tax bill, guys. It’s worth your while to take the 30 seconds to log in and vote on the matter. Just sayin’.

Title: BlackRock Systematic Multi-Strategy (BAMBX) vs BlackRock Tactical Opportunities (PCBAX)

Reducing my risk profile for accounts that Fidelity manages allows more flexibility in what I manage. In other words, the intermediate investment bucket aggressive sub portfolio that Fidelity manages became more conservative, while I added a little risk to the conservative sub portfolio that I manage. I would like to design a low-risk sub-portfolio that has a low correlation to stocks and bonds, returns about 5%, and has some inflation protection. The objective is to always have at least one fund that is up while still having decent returns. I began with the MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset, limited by correlations to the S&P 500 and bonds, low losses for the minimum rolling three-year period, and an MFO Risk rating of average or lower. I trimmed the list using 2022 performance, in which both stocks and bonds did poorly, and the COVID bear market. I found BlackRock Tactical Opportunities (PCBAX) and BlackRock Systematic Multi-Strategy (BAMBX) worth further investigation. In this article, I evaluate how a sub-portfolio including PCBAX and BAMBX might be able to meet my objectives. I have already purchased Victory Pioneer Multi-Asset Income (PMAIX) and Aegis Value Fund (AVALX) which David Snowball wrote about in When Reality Bites: Preparing for Market Turbulence Ahead and Aegis Value Fund (AVALX). I already own PIMCO Inflation Response Multi-Asset (PZRMX) and include it in this analysis. I finished reading Our Dollar, Your Problem, by Kenneth Rogoff, which left me with more questions than answers, so I bought and am currently reading The Price of Money, by Rob Dix. I also dusted off The Demise of the Dollar, by Addison Wiggin, and Global Macro Trading, by Greg Gliner, which, fortunately, I highlighted when I first read and can skim again in a few hours. Since President Nixon took the U.S. off the gold standard in 1971, the US has gone through periods of stability, but also the 1970s decade of stagflation, the Great Financial Crisis (2008), Quantitative Easing (2009 to 2014, 2020 to 2021), and the COVID pandemic (2020). Gross Federal debt as a percentage of gross domestic product has risen from 34% to 120%, and the federal deficit has risen to 6% of GDP. Central banks have been experimenting with their own versions of stablecoin, which may further erode the dominance of the dollar. Domestic stock valuations are high, suggesting below-average long-term returns. I expect higher financial volatility and more frequent periods of inflation in the coming decade(s). I selected the funds in Table #1 to evaluate further. They are sorted from the lowest correlation to the S&P 500 to the highest over the past seven years. Notice that PCBAX has the lowest correlation to both stocks and bonds. BAMBX pays a dividend of 3.8% while PCBAX does not currently have a dividend. PMAIX and FPACX have the potential to increase returns, but at higher risk. PCBAX had a maximum drawdown of 37% during the financial crisis compared to 29% for FPACX. This highlights the benefits of building a diversified portfolio. Table #1: – Fund Candidates – Metrics 7 Years Source: Author using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. The past decade covers the COVID bear market, Quantitative Easing and Tightening, rising inflation and interest rates, and rising valuations of the S&P 500. In particular, I am interested in how funds performed during the COVID bear market and 2022, when stocks and bonds did poorly. BlackRock Tactical Opportunities (PCBAX), BlackRock Systematic Multi-Strategy (BAMBX), and Victory Pioneer Multi-Asset Income (PMAIX) performed well during these two periods. Figure 1 – Fund Candidates Source: Author using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. I extracted monthly returns for the past ten years for these funds using the MFO Premium fund screener. I selected periods with at least three months where stocks had negative returns, bonds had negative returns, and both stocks and bonds had negative returns. The results are contained in Table #2. Table 2 – Cumulative Returns During Stock and Bond Downturns – 10 Years Source: Author using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. BlackRock Tactical Opportunities (PCBAX) has a lower correlation to stocks and bonds than BlackRock Systematic Multi-Strategy (BAMBX). Returns are similar, but PCBAX does not pay a dividend. BAMBX appears to outperform PCBAX when both stocks and bonds are positive, while PCBAX appears to outperform when neither stocks nor bonds are doing well. PMAIX is less correlated to the S&P500 than FPACX and is a little less risky, but has lower returns than FPACX. FPA Crescent Fund is available with Fidelity in two share classes: FPACX with a $49.95 transaction fee and 1.06% expense ratio, and FPFRX without a transaction fee and 1.15% expense ratio. I don’t own the FPA Crescent Fund, but I want to purchase it at some point. I wanted a little help evaluating a low-risk portfolio that is uncorrelated to stocks and bonds and returns 5%. I selected the funds in Table #3 as inputs in Portfolio Visualizer. The link is provided here. I selected the time period from January 2018 to December 2023 to capture the COVID bear market 2022, in which stocks and bonds did poorly, but excluded 2024, where stock market valuation increased significantly. Table 3 – Funds Selected for Portfolio Visualizer Optimization Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. Table #4 shows the results of the optimization for maximum return at 6% volatility, maximum Sharpe ratio, and a simple allocation of my own. All three had returns of 4.8% to 6.1% with drawdowns of 8.7% to 13.1%. Table 4 – Portfolio Visualizer Results Source: Author Using Portfolio Visualizer Figure #2 shows the results graphically adjusted for inflation. The drawdowns can be reduced by adding both BlackRock Tactical Opportunities (PCBAX) and BlackRock Systematic Multi-Strategy (BAMBX) without the return suffering significantly. Figure 2 – Portfolio Visualizer Results Adjusted for Inflation Source: Author Using Portfolio Visualizer Table #5 contains the correlation matrix of the funds. Victory Pioneer Multi-Asset Income (PMAIX), Aegis Value Fund (AVALX), PIMCO Inflation Response Multi-Asset (PZRMX), and FPA Crescent Fund (FPACX) have correlations close to each other, which reduces their ability to diversify a portfolio. Table 5 – Asset Correlations Source: Author Using Portfolio Visualizer BlackRock Systematic Multi-Strategy (BAMBX) About this Fund: Investment Approach: The BlackRock Systematic Multi-Strategy Fund is a diversified alternative strategy that seeks to provide total return comprised of current income and capital appreciation in both periods of strong market returns and periods of market stress. Investors Who Might Be Interested in BAMBX: BlackRock’s systematic alternative strategies seek differentiated risk and return profiles with a low correlation to broad asset classes to help diversify portfolios. Blackrock Tactical Opportunities (PCBAX): About this Fund: Investment Approach: The BlackRock Tactical Opportunities Fund is a macro strategy that tactically allocates across global markets and asset classes and has achieved lowly correlated, stable growth. Investors Who Might Be Interested in PCBAX: An alternative multi-asset strategy might be a good fit for investors seeking differentiated risk and return profiles with low correlation to broad asset classes to help diversify 60/40 portfolios. My conservative intermediate sub portfolio that I manage consists of bond ladders, short- and intermediate-duration bond funds. I have been shifting to a barbell approach, moving short-term bond funds into those with intermediate durations in order to lock in higher yields. My withdrawal strategy is to withdraw 4% from this sub portfolio when stocks are not performing well and more aggressive sub-portfolios when stocks are doing well. At this point, as bond ladders mature, I favor BlackRock Systematic Multi-Strategy (BAMBX) over BlackRock Tactical Opportunities (PCBAX) as a long-term investment because it is more conservative and pays a dividend. PCBAX has been outperforming BAMBX year-to-date. I don’t expect to make changes until closer to the end of the year and will continue to monitor both.

We wrote last month about the plan to convert Akre Focus Fund into an ETF (“Enduring Principles, Evolving Markets,” 8/2025), a move that would benefit shareholders by increasing interest in the portfolio, reducing expenses, and controlling taxes. That plan encountered a stumbling block: fund shareholders have not bestirred themselves to cast their vote (up or down) on the change proposal. According to the adviser’s rep, only 23% of shares have been voted, which requires an expensive second round of solicitations in hopes of reaching the 50.1% threshold. If you are an Akre shareholder, vote! You received paper notifications and will see something comparable if you log in to your account. If you’re an RIA and your clients hold Akre shares, encourage them to take two minutes to lower their fees and tax bill. This is, by the way, a common problem for advisers and explains the increasingly common practice of writing prospectuses that exclude the necessity of shareholder action. The Aberdeen Group has announced plans to convert abrdn International Small Cap Fund to abrdn International Small Cap Active ETF (ASCI) and abrdn Intermediate Municipal Income Fund into abrdn Ultra Short Municipal Income Active ETF (AMUN). Tax-free, lower fees, all the usual stuff. Fans continue to hope that the firm will save enough money to be able to buy an “e”. Baron Capital has filed registration filings for its first exchange-traded funds: In addition, Baron Fin Tech ($70 million AUM, three-star, low risk, below-average return, per Morningstar) and Technology (five-star, $100 million AUM, high return, above-average risk) funds are being converted into ETFs. Annual fees have not been stated at this time. The reorganizations are expected to be completed on or about December 12. T. Rowe Price has filed its registration statement for the following ETFs: The ETFs will be co-managed by numerous T. Rowe Price investment advisors; expenses have not been stated as of this writing. Vanguard has registered three active fundamental stock exchange-traded funds. Vanguard Wellington Dividend Growth Active ETF (VDIG), Vanguard Wellington U.S. Growth Active ETF (VUSG), and Vanguard Wellington U.S. Value Active ETF (VUSV) are in registration. The expense ratios for VDIG, VUSG, and VUSV will be .40%, .35% and .30%, respectively. VUSV will be managed by David Palmer, who manages the Vanguard Windsor fund; VUSG will be managed by Michael Masdea and Brian Barbetta, both of whom manage the Vanguard Global Equity fund; and VDIG will be managed by Peter Fisher, who manages the Vanguard Dividend Growth fund. Oakmark has submitted an initial registration statement for three ETFs: Oakmark International Large Cap, Oakmark Global Large Cap, and Oakmark U.S. Concentrated ETFs. Expenses have not been stated for any of the ETFs at this time. Anthony P. Coniaris, CFA, David G. Herro, CFA, and Eric Liu, CFA, will be the portfolio managers of the Oakmark International Large Cap ETF. Anthony P. Coniaris, CFA, David G. Herro, CFA, M. Colin Hudson, CFA, Eric Liu, CFA, and John A. Sitarz, CFA, CPA, will be the portfolio managers of the Oakmark Global Large Cap ETF. Robert F. Bierig and Alexander E. Fitch, CFA, will be the portfolio managers of Oakmark U.S. Concentrated ETF. The Carillon Chartwell Small Cap fund will not be merged into the Carillon Chartwell Small Cap Growth fund. No reason was stated for the change of heart. T. Rowe Price Small-Cap Stock Fund and its institutional sibling are opening to new investors on September 30th for investors who invest directly with T. Rowe Price. The fund was closed to new investors on January 2, 2014, due to its assets surpassing $10 billion under management. The fund was previously closed in 2004, only to reopen in 2009 with significant asset gathering over the years. Brown Advisory – WMC Strategic European Equity fund closed to new investors on August 8th. Effective on or about October 13, 2025, Amplify High Income ETF will change to the Amplify CEF High Income ETF. On October 14, 2025, the BlackRock Liquid Federal Trust Fund becomes the BlackRock Select Treasury Based Liquidity Fund. The new fund will narrow its strategy to invest 100% in U.S. Treasury instruments with maturities of three months or less and overnight repos. Pending shareholder approval, DoubleLine Floating Rate will be merged with and into the American Beacon DoubleLine Floating Rate Income Fund sometime in Q4, 2025. Odd, on face. The DoubleLine version is both larger and has a substantially stronger three-year record. Effective October 1, 2025, five Russell ETFs will drop the word “Active” from their names. There are the U.S. Small Cap Equity Active ETF, International Developed Equity Active, Global Equity Active ETF, Emerging Markets Equity Active ETF, and Global Infrastructure Active ETF. There’s nothing in the filing to suggest that the ETFs will become less active, just that they won’t own the term anymore. Odd. Pending shareholder approval (vote, people, vote!), the two STF funds will soon become Hennessy funds. STF Tactical Growth & Income ETF would become a shareholder of the Hennessy Tactical Growth and Income ETF, and the shareholders of the STF Tactical Growth ETF would become shareholders of the Hennessy Tactical Growth ETF. Which requires that the aforementioned shareholders get off their duffs and vote their proxy. Anchor Risk Managed Global Strategies fund will be liquidated on or about August 28th. BNY Mellon Dynamic Total Return fund will be liquidated on or about October 24th. Calamos Dividend Growth fund is being reorganized into the Calamos Growth and Income fund on or about August 29th. The Federated Hermes Short-Term Government Fund will be closed to new accounts on October 1st (why not now, do you suppose?) and will be liquidated on October 4, 2025. Issachar Fund (founder on one of the 12 tribes of Israel, the name translates to “there is a reward,” check below for details) will cease operations on or about September 29, 2025. Kind of a cool lion’s head logo (the manager is named Lyons) paired with a 3.5% expense ratio, 1500% turnover ratio, a 75% cash stake, and 1.7% APR over 10 years. JPMorgan Climate Change Solutions ETF will be liquidated on or about October 10th. Jackson Square has proposed merging its Jackson Square Large-Cap Growth Fund and Jackson Square SMID-Cap Growth Fund with and into the $1 billion Spyglass Growth Fund, notwithstanding the fact that Spyglass doesn’t invest in small- to mid-cap stocks. Spyglass is concentrated, socially conscious, and led by a former Edgewood Growth manager. Nice people. Southern Asset Management is merging its Longleaf International fund into its Longleaf Global fund. A shareholder vote will occur; if the reorganization is approved, it will occur before or during December 2025. Mirova International Megatrends fund was liquidated on August 19th. NexPoint Climate Tech Fund has closed to new investors and will be liquidated on or about Sept 2, 2025 Vontobel Global Environmental Change fund was liquidated on or about August 29th. WPG Partners Select Hedged fund will be liquidated on or about August 28th. The Shadow here! Like Mark, I’m a long-time member of the MFO community. I’ve started over 2300 discussion threads, most focusing on developments in the fund industry. I am a personal investor that was introduced to mutual funds when I was young to fund my college education. As I have grown older, I have expanded my mutual funds holdings to a point where I probably have too many; however, this year they all did extremely well due to the overall performance of the market.

The 60km route stretched along the Dublin coastline - from Blackrock to Raheny Dart stations – symbolising the 60km boundary line dividing Gaza and Israel. Participants could walk or run the distance and join at different points, as the route was divided into four 15km sections with staggered start times to reflect the full boundary line. The charity was organised in support of Medical Aid for Palestinians (MAP) and has already raised over €18,000, surpassing the target of €6,000 by 300pc, as donations are still coming in.

Photo: Jennie Cotter Today's News in 90 seconds - 8th September 2025 Actress and comedian Norma Sheahan supported participants as they left and returned to Blackrock, before running from Raheny back to Blackrock herself. She described the atmosphere at the event as "magic" and "full of heart, grit, and community spirit". "It was a day of connection and kindness, proving that no matter how far away Gaza may feel, we can stand in solidarity and make a real difference," she said. "Every step was a message to families in Gaza that they’re not alone and not forgotten," she added. Funds raised through the event will go directly to MAP, a humanitarian charity associated with Trócaire, delivering urgent medical care, food and shelter to families in Gaza. Donations will help provide lifesaving equipment, such as respiratory cannulas for children, intravenous drip bags for patients in cardiac arrest and antibiotics. Runners came together for the Gaza solidarity run on Sunday. Photo: Jennie Cotter Aibhín Bray, the organiser of the run, said: "We started as a small group of friends who felt utterly helpless watching the situation in Gaza." "What happened yesterday was extraordinary - people of all ages and backgrounds came together to walk, run, cheer, donate and volunteer. "It was beyond anything we could have imagined. It shows that even when the situation feels overwhelming, hope can grow when a community comes together and that each of us has the power to step forward and make a meaningful difference. “We are deeply grateful to every single person who contributed – whether they ran, walked, volunteered, donated or simply cheered along the route. Every act of kindness made this possible," she added. Donations can still be made through the JustGiving fundraising link "Run for their Lives: Medical Aid for Palestinians (MAP)". The description of the fundraiser reads: "We are a group of running friends who are heartbroken by the forced starvation of children and adults in Gaza, and we can no longer stand silent and do nothing." "Please join us on Sunday for a powerful act of solidarity and support," it added. Runners at the Gaza solidarity run. Photo: Jennie Cotter Runners at the Gaza solidarity run.

Title: European Crypto Giant CoinShares Plans US Market Entry with $1.2B Merger

Time Published: 2025-09-08T20:12:32Z

© 2025 Coinspeaker LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. CoinShares International Limited announced a definitive $1.2 billion business combination agreement with Vine Hill Capital Investment Corp. to list on US Nasdaq by December 2025. CoinShares International Limited announced on September 8 its entry into a definitive business combination agreement with Vine Hill Capital Investment Corp., a special purpose acquisition company, that will result in the European asset manager listing on the Nasdaq Stock Market in the United States. The transaction values CoinShares at $1.2 billion on a pre-money basis, positioning the company as one of the largest publicly traded digital asset managers globally. The merger is supported by a $50 million anchor investment from an institutional investor. The deal enables CoinShares to transition its listing from Nasdaq Stockholm to the US market, where over half of global assets under management are located. CoinShares currently manages approximately $10 billion in assets and ranks as the fourth-largest global provider of crypto exchange-traded products after BlackRock, Grayscale, and Fidelity. In Europe, CoinShares holds the number one position with a 34% market share. The company has experienced significant growth, with assets under management more than tripling over the past two years, driven by strong investor inflows and the success of new product launches. Jean-Marie Mognetti, CEO and co-founder of CoinShares, described the transaction as “far more than a change of listing venue from Sweden to the United States” but rather “a strategic transition for CoinShares, accelerating our ambition for global leadership.” “The US is now serving as the crucible of the digital asset space. By listing in the United States, CoinShares is positioning itself to meet growing investor demand and to participate more fully in the evolution of this new industry,” Mognetti stated in the press release. The move comes amid unprecedented growth in the crypto ETP market. Global crypto ETP assets under management surged to $134.5 billion by Q4 2024, representing a 950% increase year-over-year, primarily driven by the approval of US spot Bitcoin ETFs. The crypto asset management market has grown from $857.09 million in 2023 to $1.06 billion in 2024 and is expected to continue expanding at a compound annual growth rate of 24.61% through 2030. In the second quarter of 2025, CoinShares reported net profit of $32.4 million and asset management fees of $30.0 million. The company’s diversified product suite includes 32 crypto exchange-traded products across multiple platforms, covering Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and other digital assets. Moreover, with these achievements, the company continued its expansion in the EU. In July, CoinShares secured a MiCA license to offer crypto services across Europe. The financial regulator of France granted the permit. Under the agreement, CoinShares and Vine Hill shareholders will exchange their securities for shares in a new combined company, Odysseus Holdings Limited. The transaction is expected to close by the end of the fourth quarter of 2025, subject to shareholder approvals, regulatory approvals, and other customary closing conditions. The boards of both CoinShares and Vine Hill have unanimously approved the business combination. Following completion, CoinShares intends to delist from Nasdaq Stockholm, with the new entity expected to begin trading on the US Nasdaq by December 18, 2025. One thing is certain: now is the best moment for any crypto company that offers services to institutional clients, with many businesses going public and experiencing global growth. CoinShares is one of many examples today. Disclaimer: Coinspeaker is committed to providing unbiased and transparent reporting.

Title: Nasdaq Files SEC Proposal to Enable Tokenized Securities Trading
URL: https://www.coinspeaker.com/nasdaq-files-sec-proposal-to-enable-tokenized-securities-trading/
Time Published: 2025-09-08T18:39:29Z

© 2025 Coinspeaker LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Nasdaq submitted an SEC filing to allow trading of tokenized equities and ETPs on its exchange, potentially reducing settlement times and market friction through blockchain integration. Nasdaq took a step toward blending blockchain with traditional finance on Sept. 8, 2025, by submitting a filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the United States. The move aims to let member firms and investors trade tokenized versions of equities and exchange-traded products (ETPs) on the Nasdaq Stock Market. According to a LinkedIn post by Nasdaq President Tal Cohen, this integration could reduce friction in markets, speed up settlement times, and automate processes. Cohen noted the filing seeks to leverage US equities’ strengths, like robust oversight and investor safeguards, to scale blockchain benefits responsibly. Details from Nasdaq’s newsroom Q&A reveal how the system would work. Participants could choose tokenized or traditional forms at order entry, with the Depository Trust Corporation (DTC) handling clearing and settlement for tokens. According to Chuck Mack, Nasdaq’s Senior Vice President of North American Markets, the exchange anticipates that blockchain integration will streamline trading operations by reducing settlement times, improving transaction transparency, and creating a more seamless process from order execution to final clearing. “Nasdaq’s proposed rule changes would enable member firms and investors to trade tokenized versions of equity securities and exchange-traded products (ETPs) on our markets. Our goal is to integrate digital assets into Nasdaq’s current infrastructure and systems, which will advance financial innovation while maintaining stability, fairness, and investor protection,” said Mack. Mack explained that tokenized securities are digital representations on blockchain, but they hold the same value and rights as non-tokenized shares. This avoids creating separate markets that could dilute liquidity or transparency. The filing opens for public comment, inviting industry input. Nasdaq views it as part of a broader evolution, responding to demand for innovation while prioritizing capital formation and market integrity. This aligns with growing tokenization trends, as seen in BlackRock’s BUIDL fund on Ethereum and platforms like Robinhood offering tokenized stocks in Europe. Tokenization has gained traction since 2022, when the RWA market hovered around $5 billion, focusing on basic assets like stablecoins. By 2023, growth hit 308%, reaching $15 billion, with pilots from firms like Centrifuge enabling multichain RWAs, according to market reports. In 2024, institutions accelerated adoption: BlackRock launched its BUIDL Treasury fund on Ethereum in March, surpassing $500 million by mid-year. Fidelity tokenized similar products, while the World Economic Forum noted potential for cross-border efficiency. By Sept. 2025, the market exceeds $24 billion, up 380% from 2022. Recent moves include Ondo Finance tokenizing over 100 US stocks and ETFs on Ethereum and Trust Wallet integrating tokenized equities for millions of users. Headline Today: Trust Wallet (200M+ users) brings tokenized U.S. stocks & ETFs on-chain, powered by Ondo + 1inch The tokenization wave isn’t slowing down.Every week, new moves show how close we are to a future where real-world assets live fully on-chain. Here’s what’s fresh… pic.twitter.com/pvO6P5zbsi — Bellasuga (@HARDAY_DANIEL) September 4, 2025 Nasdaq’s proposal parallels these developments, bridging TradFi with DeFi by tokenizing listed securities, much like Robinhood’s EU platform offering 24/5 tokenized stock trading since early 2025.

Δ The company announced Monday (Sept. 8) that it had entered into a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) agreement that will see CoinShares list on the Nasdaq, valuing it at $1.2 billion. Following the agreement, CoinShares will delist from the Swedish market. Jean-Marie Mognetti, co-founder and CEO of CoinShares, said the transaction marks an effort by the company to achieve “global leadership” amid a more favorable regulatory environment for crypto. “The case for digital assets as an investment class and blockchain as a transformative technology has reached a decisive inflection point and can no longer be ignored. There is no going back,” he said. “The U.S. is now serving as the crucible of the digital asset space. By listing in the United States, CoinShares is positioning itself to meet growing investor demand and to participate more fully in the evolution of this new industry.” The company said in the release said that it is the fourth-largest manager of digital asset ETP products globally, behind BlackRock, Grayscale and Fidelity, and the top manager in Europe, the Middle East and Africa with a 34% market share. The company also has roughly $10 billion in assets under management, a figure that has tripled in the last two years. CoinShares said it has also gone from a single platform with four products in 2021 to a 32-product suite spread across four platforms. CoinShares is among several crypto firms that have made an effort to go public on the U.S. markets this year, either through an initial public offering (IPO) or SPAC deals. This is happening as the U.S. government, under President Donald Trump, embraces the crypto sector after years of regulatory crackdown. Among the companies to already list are Circle, issuer of the USDC stablecoin, which had a blockbuster IPO earlier this year. The crypto exchange Bullish enjoyed similar success when it went public last month. “With Circle’s entry into the public market, a new chapter looks set to begin,” PYMNTS wrote June 5. “With blue-chip banks underwriting the deal and retail investors clamoring for shares, the traditional finance world appears more open than ever to embracing digital assets. Or, at least, the potentially regulated and transparent kind of digital assets.” Still to come is the IPO from crypto exchange Gemini, which said last week it is targeting a $2.1 valuation when it goes public.

Title: Donald Trump's Mass Deportation Agenda Has A Surprising Stakeholder: Bill Gates

Find The Truth.Corruption thrives in the shadows. Our reporting tracks who benefits and who pays the price. Support fearless investigations - become a member today. Already contributed? Log in to hide these messages. Senior Reporter, HuffPost National Desk Senior Reporter President Donald Trump’s mass deportation agenda has a surprising stakeholder: Bill Gates. The multibillionaire tech mogul and philanthropist owns a large portion of a key service provider for immigration flights. And now, with new funding from Congress and an aggressive push from the White House, more and more immigration flights are taking off, transporting immigration detainees both within the United States and to their home countries — or, in some cases, to places they’ve never been before. Gates’ connection to the U.S. detention and deportation machine is a company called Signature Aviation. Signature calls itself “the world’s largest network of private aviation terminals,” and it’s a linchpin in the day-to-day machinery of Trump’s immigration enforcement apparatus. For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth. Support our mission to keep us around for the next 20 — we can’t do this without you. Private charter carriers subcontracted for Immigration and Customs Enforcement to transport immigration detainees — part of a network known as “ICE Air,” a reference to the Department of Homeland Security’s ICE Air Operations — use Signature’s services daily. As a fixed-base operator, or FBO, Signature supplies ground crews, aviation fuel, boarding stairs, and airplane hangar space at hundreds of airports around the world, mostly in the United States. The private firm that holds Gates’ and the Gates Foundation Trust’s assets, Cascade Investment, increased its stake in the company to 30% in 2021, when it and two partners bought Signature outright for $4.7 billion. Human rights advocates — plane trackers and activists who keep tabs on deportation flights, as well as the aviation and logistics companies profiting from them — say Gates’ stake in Signature is at odds with his humanitarian work, including the Gates Foundation’s support of a plethora of immigration-focused nonprofits. Without FBOs like Signature, they say, Trump’s mass deportation agenda would be stuck on the ground. Gates himself has not publicly commented on Signature Aviation’s crucial role in servicing ICE Air flights. Neither the Gates Foundation nor Cascade Asset Management Company, which oversees Cascade Investment, responded to multiple requests for comment. At one airport, Signature appears to have worked to make its branding less visibly associated with immigration flights. Last month, a set of Signature boarding stairs in Seattle — where the county government set up cameras in 2023 to keep an eye on immigration flights — got a new accessory: two sheets of cardboard, taped over the company’s logos. FBOs “are critical, obviously, because they provide fuel and other services while the plane makes its stops,” said Tom Cartwright, a retired financial executive who has tracked ICE flights for nearly six years. Cartwright estimated that through the end of June, 95% of the ICE Air flights he’d tracked were operated by charter companies, with military and Coast Guard planes being used for the remainder. That doesn’t include a tally of commercial flights used to deport people, he said — but in fiscal year 2017, ICE Air used charter flights to remove or transfer 181,317 people, compared with just 8,288 who were removed on commercial flights, according to a 2019 DHS inspector general report. “In this case, when they’re doing 1,100 flights a month, that’s a pretty significant piece of the operation — so they’re absolutely critical,” he said of the planes carrying immigration detainees. “Without a fixed-base operator, I’m not sure this system really operates.” In a recent report covering local connections to alleged human rights violations stemming from the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement agenda, the University of Washington Center for Human Rights (UWCHR), which has studied ICE Air flights for years, called out Gates’ Signature Aviation investment specifically. “In Washington, our most famous philanthropist grows his investments in part by supporting a company complicit in gross human rights abuses, potentially ascending to the level of crimes against humanity,” the report alleged. To report this story, HuffPost scoured government records and plane location data, collected plane-spotting reports from activists on the ground, and matched aviation photographs to planes known to ferry ICE detainees. Still, ICE Air operates largely in the shadows, and many key players, including Signature Aviation, did not answer detailed questions about their operations. So we wanted to see the process for ourselves. On Aug. 31, HuffPost witnessed Signature Aviation in action. On the tarmac of Newark Liberty International Airport, a couple hundred yards from Signature’s private terminal, a Signature-branded set of boarding stairs and fuel tanker met a Boeing 737 belonging to Avelo Airlines, the low-cost carrier that has faced protests and a boycott from potential passengers over its work with ICE Air. Like other Avelo planes working ICE Air flights, this plane, with the tail number N801XT, was recently painted completely white, erasing any prominent Avelo branding. One by one, 16 people dressed in white and gray, and shackled at the wrists, waist and ankles, hobbled off the plane and onto Signature Aviation’s boarding stairs, unable to reach the handrail on the stairs. On the tarmac, the second man in line shuffled his feet slightly, taking uneven steps as his head drooped, making him look older than the rest. The plane had just finished a two-and-a-half-hour flight from Alexandria, Louisiana, a central hub for ICE Air flights, meaning the men had likely been shackled for several hours straight. The detainees waited on the tarmac as they were processed into sprinter vans with flashing police lights. A Signature-branded fuel tanker sidled up to the plane, and personnel on the ground hauled plastic mesh bags known to be used for detainees’ personal belongings. Eventually, accompanied by Port Authority police vehicles, the caravan left the tarmac, likely heading to nearby ICE detention facilities. Two weeks prior, HuffPost saw a similar scene play out, when a plane operated by Eastern Air Express — the same aircraft CNN recently spotted ferrying people in ICE custody — was met with similar fanfare at Newark. Law enforcement vehicles with flashing lights approached that plane as well, including one that looked similar to a shuttle bus previously filmed transporting detainees out of Delaney Hall, the infamous immigration jail. In both cases, after about an hour on the ground, the planes continued on their way around the country, ferrying people in ICE custody to other detention facilities, and for some, onto their ultimate deportation, according to one activist plane spotter who goes by the moniker “JJ in DC” on Bluesky and who helped HuffPost track the aircraft. “In Washington, our most famous philanthropist grows his investments in part by supporting a company complicit in gross human rights abuses, potentially ascending to the level of crimes against humanity.” Such scenes are now commonplace throughout the country. But they are not new. For over a decade, private aviation contractors have handled tens of thousands of ICE Air flights, according to Cartwright’s count, which can collectively transfer or remove hundreds of thousands of people annually. Recent video from King County’s cameras at Boeing Field-King County International Airport in Seattle shows a grim parade of detainees. One climbs a set of boarding stairs while shackled and holding a cane. Another, also shackled — detainees generally are, including during flights — is manhandled by several guards who run him onto the plane; a few feet before Signature’s staircase, the group stumbles and the man falls onto the tarmac. “The use of restraints on detainees during deportation flights is a standard ICE protocol and an essential measure to ensure the safety and well-being of both detainees and the officers/agents accompanying them,” an unidentified DHS spokesperson told HuffPost in a statement. “Our practices align with those followed by other relevant authorities and is fully in line with established legal standards.” “ICE takes its commitment to promoting safe, secure, humane environments for those in our custody very seriously,” the statement added. “ICE Air Operations flights are law enforcement sensitive. ICE conducts flights throughout the U.S. on a daily basis. For operational security purposes, ICE does not discuss ongoing or future operations.” Activists working to end ICE Air’s presence in Seattle have zeroed in on Signature’s work as a service provider for charter flights. “The presence of Signature is essential for ICE to be within the airport, because without having a fixed-base operator to service the planes, they can’t land there, and no one else is doing this type of work,” said Guadalupe Gonzalez, flight monitoring coordinator for La Resistencia, an immigrant-led activist group in Washington state that seeks to end immigrant detention and deportation. “Signature Aviation specifically are the ones responsible for servicing ICE at Boeing Field.” Gonzalez said La Resistencia volunteers, who observe ICE Air transfers in person at Boeing Field, have in recent years reported seeing detainees bound in the “WRAP” restraint system, a type of full-body restraint device that has come under scrutiny in the past. More commonly, Gonzalez said, people with mobility issues were made to walk up Signature’s stairs to a waiting ICE Air flight. Not having a presence at Boeing Field, Gonzalez said, “would impair [ICE’s] efforts to deport as many people as possible — or, at the very minimum, make it more costly.” Signature Aviation did not answer a lengthy list of questions about its practices, including its involvement with ICE Air. Instead, the company sent a one-sentence statement. “Our FBOs must accept flight operations that comply with the law, FAA regulations and contract requirements at federally funded airports,” said Rosanna Fiske, the company’s global head of corporate affairs. Fiske did not respond to follow-up questions about the nature of Signature’s obligations, including the terms of contracts it may have signed with ICE Air charter operators. Gates is a significant shareholder in Signature Aviation. Cascade Investment LLC, the holding company for Gates’ and the Gates Foundation’s assets, first bought a piece of the company’s predecessor, BBA Aviation, in 2009. In 2021, a bidding war broke out over the company, and Gates’ Cascade — then Signature’s largest individual shareholder, with a 19% stake — joined forces with Blackstone Group and Global Infrastructure Partners to buy it outright. (Global Infrastructure Partners was acquired by BlackRock in 2024.) Working together, the three firms bought Signature for $4.7 billion, with Cascade winding up with 30% of the company. Cascade Investment LLC is overseen by Cascade Asset Management Company. That firm’s chief investment officer is Michael Larson, who has Gates’ “complete trust and faith,” Gates said in 2014, at a party he threw celebrating the 20th anniversary of Larson managing his assets. The Wall Street Journal reported at the time that their arrangement was “simple: Mr. Larson makes money, and Mr. Gates gives it away.” Cascade Investment is located in the same Kirkland, Washington, office park as Gates’ personal office, The New York Times noted in a 2021 story. Cascade’s mandate, one unnamed former employee told the Times for the same story, was: “We don’t want Bill’s name in the headlines.” Cascade’s work on Gates’ behalf has come up in the news before. For example, when The Land Report revealed in 2021 that Gates was “America’s largest private farmland owner,” what they were really talking about, as NBC News later described it, was farmland “purchased through a constellation of companies that all link back to [Bill and Melinda Gates’] investment group, Cascade Investments, based in Kirkland, Washington.” When Gates was asked about his farmland purchases, which made national news, he said, “My investment group chose to do this” and “all these decisions are made by a professional investment team.” The same might apply to Signature Aviation. It’s unclear how much Gates knows about his stake in the company, or whether he knows that Signature plays such a crucial role in Trump’s mass deportation operation. Still, “it would be surprising if Gates couldn’t influence a decision to disinvest of this particular investment,” said Cartwright, who before his retirement spent decades at J.P. Morgan, including as chief financial officer of one division that covered 5,000 bank branches. The foundation has previously addressed concerns about its money being invested in Signature Aviation. One complaint recently filed through EthicsPoint, a public-facing portal to submit ethical concerns to the foundation, and later shared with HuffPost, accused the foundation of “providing material support for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement” through its investment in Signature. In response, the foundation said it did not “control or participate in the activities of the Gates Foundation Trust.” Instead, the foundation said, the trust’s assets were “independently managed by Cascade Asset Management Company.” Look closely and you’ll see Signature Aviation popping up across Trump’s mass deportation pipeline. In fact, the company is part of perhaps the most infamous footage of Trump’s second term so far: an “ASMR” video that glorifies shackling and transporting immigration detainees. The video was filmed at Boeing Field, where the number of contracted ICE flights, all serviced by Signature Aviation, has shot up this year. It also happens to be a 20-minute drive from the Gates Foundation’s offices. Signature’s distinct logo is visible at the top of a set of boarding stairs about five seconds into the clip: ASMR: Illegal Alien Deportation Flight 🔊 pic.twitter.com/O6L1iYt9b4 Signature did not answer HuffPost’s inquiry about where it serviced ICE Air flights, but the company has had a significant footprint in servicing aviation contractors hired by ICE. In 2019, one internal ICE document listed Signature as the designated FBO for contracted ICE flights at 12 major domestic airports: Atlanta, Dallas, Newark, Houston, Laredo, Kansas City, Memphis, Minneapolis-Saint Paul, Chicago, San Diego, San Antonio, and Denver, where HuffPost recently spotted a set of Signature boarding stairs pulled up to another all-white Avelo Air plane. And while it’s not clear whether ICE Air still uses every airport on the 2019 list, the list also doesn’t include airports where Signature has recently been spotted servicing ICE Air flights. For example, the 2019 document doesn’t include Seattle’s Boeing Field. Signature now frequently services ICE flights there, and detainees picked up at the airport have ended up in El Salvador’s CECOT prison, Guantánamo Bay, and South Sudan, according to the recent report from UWCHR. The human rights center previously obtained the 2019 list of airports that listed FBOs servicing the ICE flights pursuant to a public records request to ICE. Signature also appears to be servicing immigration flights out of Jacksonville, Florida. One March email with the subject line “ICE Schedule This Week” notes several charter flights landing at Jacksonville International Airport. The activist group Ground ICE — which aims to “limit the rate at which I.C.E. can transport and remove its detainees” — obtained the document through a public records request and shared it with HuffPost. Recipients of the email included Signature Aviation’s Jacksonville manager as well as several email accounts associated with GEO Group, a private prison contractor. In July, Fox 13 News Utah captured video of apparent immigration detainees climbing a set of Signature boarding stairs at Salt Lake City International Airport. And Rolling Stone recently spotted a Coast Guard plane refueling and boarding ICE detainees at Baltimore/Washington International Airport. Independent journalist Gillian Brockell, who wrote the Rolling Stone story, told HuffPost that Signature Aviation refueled the plane. Signature is also the only FBO at Buffalo Niagara International Airport, Ground ICE has noted. Planes carrying immigration detainees pass through that airport once or twice a week, according to Cartwright, who is currently transitioning his work over to the group Human Rights First. Various entities involved with Gates’ ICE Air investment proclaim their commitment to human rights. Signature Aviation itself says it is committed to “refraining from coercion and never deliberately causing harm to anyone” and that it takes steps “to confirm that our businesses and supply chains are free from modern slavery and human trafficking.” Another company policy requires that suppliers “never use, support, or engage in forced or indentured labor, or practices involving coercion, deception, or abuse of power — including human trafficking, slavery and child labor.” As part of its efforts to combat human trafficking, it says it works with the Department of Homeland Security. (ICE falls under the purview of DHS.) Cascade says it takes “a value-oriented approach” to investing money for Gates and the Gates Foundation Trust, and that one of its objectives is to “protect Bill and the Trust by acting lawfully, honestly, ethically, and with integrity, safeguarding their assets and information.” It notes that “neither Cascade nor the Trust play a role in the grantmaking or operations of the foundation” and that the foundation “does not control or participate in the Trust’s investment activities.” The Gates Foundation says its mission is to “create a world where every person has the opportunity to live a healthy, productive life,” and the foundation has awarded grants to multiple prominent immigration-focused nonprofits. The experiences of immigration detainees traveling on ICE Air — particularly ICE’s use of shackles, which bind their wrists and ankles — seemingly stand in contrast to those commitments. The shackles “felt very disrespectful, dehumanizing to a lot of degrees,” Mahmoud Khalil, the Palestinian activist jailed and threatened with deportation for his beliefs, recalled to Zeteo after his release from ICE custody in June. After more than a day of travel, “by the time I arrived in Jena, [Louisiana, home to an infamous ICE jail,] I couldn’t walk because my leg was swollen from the shackles,” Khalil added. Deportation flight passengers have alleged “the use of racist epithets and insults, and rough physical treatment upon boarding,” as well as, in more isolated cases, “beatings, the use of straitjackets, verbal abuse and threats, and the denial of access to restrooms,” according to a UWCHR summary of public records it received detailing the complaints. In one case, a Somalia-bound deportation flight sat on a tarmac in Senegal for a full day due to technical issues, while detainees remained shackled inside and the plane’s toilets “overfilled with human waste,” according to a subsequent lawsuit. The plane eventually returned all of the detainees to the United States. (The suit was ultimately dismissed for jurisdictional reasons, and many of the people on the ill-fated flight continued to face deportation proceedings.) Relying on private contractors at every stage of the deportation process creates major vulnerabilities for ICE — which may be why the Trump administration is reportedly considering purchasing its own fleet of deportation planes. While giant private prison companies like CoreCivic and GEO Group are dependent on federal contracts to survive, FBOs work in different economic conditions. Most rely on business from corporate and private jet travel, and they’re often subject to local political pressure. For example, Ground ICE has encouraged pilots to write to Signature Aviation and “let them know you will not be buying fuel from them” due to their work for ICE. More than anywhere else, Seattle’s Boeing Field represents how local anti-deportation sentiment can affect FBOs and seriously slow down ICE’s work. In 2019, amid pressure from local activist groups and an impactful report from UWCHR concerning “King County Collaboration with ICE Air Deportation Flights at Boeing Field,” then-King County executive Dow Constantine ordered, among other things, that future leases at Boeing Field contain a prohibition against the private transport of immigration detainees. The FBO for those flights at the time, Modern Aviation, stopped servicing them soon after that executive order, even though the order was ultimately blocked in court. Two other FBOs at the airport, including Signature, also said they “will not take over from Modern in servicing ICE flights,” The Seattle Times reported at the time, citing the airport’s director. (Matt Dill, general manager at Modern Aviation’s location at Boeing Field, declined to comment.) “Without the help of such companies,” the paper reported, “flights cannot operate at the airport. Though they can technically take off and land, [airport director John] Parrott said, flights need a company to open gates, to provide stairs to get passengers on and off planes, and to offer fuel.” Without an FBO in Seattle, ICE was forced to route planes through Yakima — where the airport was smaller, more remote, and hours inland. In a court filing, the Trump administration said it only landed on the remote airport after approaching three others “without success.” The Trump administration also acknowledged at the time that this shift jammed the gears of its deportation machinery, particularly when it came to people detained at the Northwest Detention Center in Tacoma. “Transporting detainees from Tacoma to Yakima, as compared to Tacoma to Boeing Field, adds, at a minimum, six hours of travel time to the process of executing an ICE Air flight,” the filing read. “Additionally,” it continued, “the transport to Yakima and back frequently requires the use of an additional bus and two additional officers, as well as additional meal and fuel costs. This takes resources away from federal law enforcement tasks that would otherwise be performed if the ICE Air flights were flying out of Boeing Field. Relocation of the ICE Air flights to Yakima also impacts ICE operations in Yakima, requiring ICE to utilize staffing of at least two officers from its Yakima sub-office to facilitate the flight processing in Yakima. Additionally, travel over the mountain passes in winter is hazardous, and frequently either slowed significantly by road conditions or suspended altogether, as was the case on January 14, 2020, when an ICE Air flight had to be cancelled due to road conditions prohibiting transport.” On March 30, 2023, a federal judge ruled against the county’s executive order requiring future FBO leases to prohibit work on deportation flights. “At that time, Signature Aviation said, ‘OK, we’ll do that business,’” recalled Angelina Snodgrass Godoy, the director of UWCHR. “Ever since then, the ICE flights have resumed at Boeing Field, and they’re being served by Signature Aviation.” Local public radio station KNKX described Signature at the time as “the fixed-base operator that agreed to service ICE flights at Boeing Field.” By May 2, four years after ICE Air flights stopped at Boeing Field, they resumed again, according to records of the flights kept by the county. Signature has been their sole service provider ever since, according to the same records. “Without a fixed-base operator, I’m not sure this system really operates.” For Godoy, the years-long absence of deportation flights running through Seattle shows just how important FBOs like Signature Aviation are. “Here in Seattle, what we saw in 2019 and to this date, was that when there was enough local concern, and people expressing local outrage about it, that the other FBOs also didn’t want to do it,” she said. “There are businesses who will say, ‘No, we don’t want this, we don’t want to be associated with this.’” Local pressure also may have recently disrupted ICE Air operations on the other side of the country. Last month, after media attention and local protest over the spike in immigration flights from Hanscom Field in Bedford, Massachusetts — including specific attention on Signature Aviation for servicing the flights — the ICE Air flights to that airport stopped, instead going through Portsmouth International Airport at Pease in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, where Signature does not have a presence. “It was because the activists were so annoying, basically, to that airfield, and they were so focused on Signature, that they decided to shift to [Portsmouth International Airport] as the hub for New England,” JJ in DC posited to HuffPost, referring to the shift from Massachusetts to New Hampshire. Godoy also speculated that the shift came in response to protest. “My impression is that, for Signature, the ICE flights are only a portion of their business, and not the majority of their business — and when the ICE flights become sufficiently notorious, that threatens Signature’s overall business, and then they say ‘no thanks,’” she said. “And it looks to me — this is speculation, because I’m not privy to the discussions between ICE and Signature — like that’s what happened at Hanscom Field,” Godoy added. “So now, ICE is going to be using a more far-away airport, which is more inconvenient for them. And they haven’t said why.” Still, even apparent route changes may not last: Two flights from Avelo Airlines planes landed at Hanscom Field on Friday and Saturday, flight records show. The airline, ICE, and Signature Aviation did not respond to questions about the purpose of the flights. The financial backing behind Signature Aviation doesn’t stop with Bill Gates and the Gates Foundation. Annual financial reports reviewed by HuffPost show several large public pension funds are also stakeholders in Signature. Institutional investors Blackstone and BlackRock (via Global Infrastructure Partners) own the remainder of the company that Gates does not. And those massive asset management firms often invest money in various funds on behalf of public pensions, nonprofits and university endowments. One such fund, a BlackRock product called Global Infrastructure Partners Fund IV, has 68 such limited partners, according to data from PitchBook, a private-equity market database. That includes the California Public Employees’ Retirement System, a public pension that in 2023 held more than $350 million of the fund; the New York State Common Retirement Fund; the Utah State University endowment; the Oregon Public Employees Retirement System; the Washington State Investment Board; and more than 60 others. BlackRock and the California Public Employees’ Retirement System declined to comment. The New York State Common Retirement Fund, Oregon Investment Council (which manages OPERS’ investments) and the Utah State University endowment didn’t respond. A spokesperson for WSIB told HuffPost that, as a policy, it does not comment on individual holdings. Washington’s stake was flagged by UWCHR, which warned in its recent report that “public workers’ retirements are being financed in part through investments in organizations that profit from the detention and deportation of our neighbors.” A handful of public pension funds are also invested in a similar offering from Blackstone, called Blackstone Infrastructure Partners. They include the New Mexico State Investment Council, the Orange County Employees’ Retirement System, Pennsylvania Public School Employees’ Retirement System, and the Teacher Retirement System of Texas, according to the PitchBook data. Blackstone didn’t respond to a request for comment, nor did the New Mexico State Investment Council. A spokesperson for the Teacher Retirement System of Texas declined to comment, citing a Texas law that prohibits discussing specific investments. The Orange County Employees’ Retirement System and Pennsylvania Public School Employees Retirement System similarly declined to comment. Azani Creeks, a senior campaign and research coordinator at PESP, a nonprofit watchdog organization focused on the private equity industry, told HuffPost that people whose pensions rely on these investments are entitled to have a say in their composition. “You can contact pension fund staff and trustees by email to schedule a meeting, and often, pension funds have regular meetings with public comment periods in which you can communicate your concerns,” Creeks said. “A handful of private equity firms, drawing on capital from pension funds, foundations, endowments, insurance companies, and other institutional investors, exert major influence through investments in companies providing services to immigrant detention facilities and migrant shelters around the United States.” JJ in DC noted that in his work tracking immigration flights, he’s been struck by just how opaque the process is. The Department of Homeland Security contracts with its main broker, CSI Aviation, which works with a network of subcontractors including GlobalX, Avelo and Eastern Air Express. Those firms in turn work with FBOs like Signature Aviation. Along the way, airplanes have been made harder to spot — with some losing all of their external branding or being taken off public flight trackers, though their information is still available on crowdsourced networks like ADS-B Exchange. (Anyone with the correct receiver can contribute to the site, which presents location information broadcast by individual aircraft over radio waves as an interactive and real-time, though not always complete, map of global aviation traffic.) The result, in the end, are taxpayer dollars quietly contributing to the portfolios of people like Gates and the Gates Foundation Trust. “This is a big pressure point,” JJ in DC told HuffPost. “And if more people apply pressure, it’s going to hurt their operations, and they’re going to have to adjust.” Matt Shuham reported from New York. Ryan Grenoble reported from Denver.

The exchange, which lists Apple, Google, Amazon, Meta, and other tech giants, would give customers the option of trading securities via traditional digital representation of ownership with or without blockchain backing. "A participant that wishes for its order to clear and settle in tokenized form shall notate its preference upon entry of the order in the system by selecting a flag that the exchange designates for this purpose, in accordance with the exchange’s procedures," Nasdaq said in its filing. "When a participant enters an order with the tokenization flag selected, the exchange will communicate the participant’s clearance and settlement instruction to The Depository Trust Company." Nasdaq's proposal adds to the fervor for tokenization among both traditional finance and digital asset-focused firms. In June, Robinhood rolled out trading for European users of U.S.-listed stocks and exchange-traded funds as tokens on Arbitrum, the Ethereum layer-2 scaling network. In May, crypto exchange Kraken announced its own tokenization plans through a partnership with Backed, using the Solana blockchain. The offering would cover more than 50 U.S.-listed stocks and exchange-traded funds. "Over time, U.S. equity markets have thrived while absorbing successive waves of technological innovations," Nasdaq said in its filing, adding: "The existing regulatory structure mandated by Congress applies to tokenized securities, regardless of whether such securities have certain unique properties (like the ability to be settled on a blockchain), much like it did when the SEC allowed securities to be decimalized and electronified and when exchange traded funds and other novel securities were approved decades ago." "The exchange believes the markets can use tokenization while continuing to provide the benefits and protections of the national market system," it added. Crypto exchanges Binance and now-defunct FTX dabbled in tokenized stock trading during the pandemic-era crypto boom, but the umbrella term faded into obscurity amid regulatory heat until BlackRock CEO Larry Fink touted tokenization as “the next generation for markets” in 2022. In its second quarter conference call in July, Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev referenced tokenization nearly a dozen times. Tenev described tokenization as “the biggest innovation in capital markets in over a decade,” during the call.

Title: Meet the bidders vying to build Hyperliquid’s USDH stablecoin
URL: https://www.dlnews.com/articles/defi/paxos-frax-agora-and-native-markets-compete-to-build-usdh-stablecoin/

About us Copy link Bidders vying to build Hyperliquid’s stablecoin are swarming the protocol. So far, six organisations have posted proposals on the protocol’s Discord server after Hyperliquid announced it will launch a stablecoin on Friday, a move that will reduce its dependency on external issuers. The plan is to let the validators who run the network decide who will get the privilege of purchasing the right to launch the stablecoin, which will trade under the ticker USDH. Hyperliquid is the biggest perpetual futures exchange in DeFi. It handled a whopping $378 billion in trading volume over the past month, per DefiLlama data. However, it currently denotes its spot markets using Circle’s USDC and Tether’s USDT stablecoins, the two biggest stablecoins on the market. Hyperliquid’s USDH will compete with USDC and USDT on the protocol, reducing its dependency on third-party stablecoins, and potentially capturing additional revenue. Validators will be able to vote on their preferred proposal after Hyperliquid’s next network upgrade, a date for which has yet to be announced. Here are the four proposals gaining the most traction among the Hyperliquid community. The biggest firm to submit a proposal so far is Paxos, the New York-based fintech behind several stablecoins, including PayPal USD and Global Dollar. It proposes using 95% of the interest earned on USDH’s reserve assets, like short-dated treasury bonds, to fund buybacks of the HYPE token. The firm plans to back USDH with US Treasury Bills, repurchase agreements, and its Global Dollar stablecoin. Paxos has a track record of contributing to multiple Hyperliquid ecosystem projects, including LHYPE, a tokenised leveraged loop trade, and WHLP, a tokenised representation of Hyperliquid’s HLP vault. Community feedback to Paxos’ proposal has been largely positive. Frax Finance, the issuer of the Frax Dollar stablecoin, is the biggest DeFi protocol to join the fray. It wants to issue USDH natively on Hyperliquid against its frxUSD stablecoin, giving holders the ability to mint and redeem the tokens across frxUSD, USDC, USDT, and US dollars. Frax hasn’t given any concrete plans on what it would do with the interest earned on reserve assets, but said it could be used to boost HYPE staking yield, conduct buybacks of the HYPE token, or used for rebates to active traders or rewards for USDH holders. Community feedback has been mostly positive, however some have questioned whether Frax is as aligned with Hyperliquid as the other organisations submitting proposals. Agora styles itself as a white-label stablecoin issuer, using its AUSD stablecoin to back other dollar-pegged assets. The firm said it plans to share 100% of net revenue from USDH’s reserve assets to fund buybacks of the HYPE token. Reserves for an Agora-issued USDH will be administered by State Street and VanEck, the same firms that Agora uses for its AUSD reserves. Agora also said it could potentially bring USDH to new users by working with consumer-facing apps like EtherFi. Feedback has been positive, but some have questioned what Agora’s incentive to issue and manage a USDH is if it plans to send all revenue minus custodian fees to Hyperliquid. Native Markets is a new organisation put together specifically to compete for the right to issue USDH. It is led by Max Fiege, a Hyperliquid ecosystem investor and advisor. Native Markets said it will back USDH with offchain reserves initially managed by BlackRock and onchain reserves managed by Superstate through stablecoin platform Bridge, which is owned by Stripe. The group proposes using 50% of the interest earned on reserve assets to buy back the HYPE token, with the other 50% set aside to fund USDH growth. Several governance participants have warned that Native Markets relying on Bridge for stablecoin issuance could present a single point of failure.

Title: Nasdaq files for regulatory nod to introduce tokenized stocks and ETFs

Nasdaq aims to integrate tokenized stocks, focusing on improving efficiency without compromising investor protection. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Nasdaq is seeking regulatory approval to introduce tokenized versions of stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) onto its existing trading platform. On Sept. 8, Tal Cohen, Nasdaq’s president, outlined the vision in a LinkedIn statement, explaining that the plan is designed to capture the efficiency gains of tokenization while preserving investor rights and market safeguards built over decades. This initiative reflects a wider shift across traditional finance where asset managers such as BlackRock and Fidelity are experimenting with tokenized offerings. Due to this growing adoption, Galaxy Research has estimated that tokenized equities could represent a $190 trillion market within two decades. Nasdaq, one of the largest traditional stock exchanges with a daily trading volume of more than $400 billion, stressed that US equities already rank as the world’s most liquid and transparent markets, supported by rigorous oversight and advanced technology. Cohen explained that the proposal would extend those strengths into the digital era rather than replace them.

Stay connected via “The approach will ensure tokenized securities trade as regular securities, safeguarding both investors’ rights and the systemic stability of our markets through tested, resilient infrastructure. It seeks to capture the benefits of the technology while ensuring it matures in a way that best serves investors, issuers, and other stakeholders across global capital markets.” He pointed out that the Nasdaq’s filing highlighted how tokenization could streamline long-standing market processes. According to him, the technology could introduce faster settlement cycles, lower transaction friction, and programmable corporate actions into the system. Still, Cohen cautioned that such changes must not come at the expense of resilience or security. He highlighted decentralized finance as a lesson in both potential and risk of integrating blockchain technology into the space. According to him, DeFi platforms have demonstrated new ways of handling trading and clearing, but have also exposed vulnerabilities when growth outpaces governance. Considering this, Cohen stressed that investor protection and operational stability must remain at the core as new technologies are introduced. As a result, the exchange said it is ready to collaborate with infrastructure providers to explore applications such as modernized proxy voting and automated post-trade services.

CoinShares, one of Europe’s largest digital asset managers, is heading to Wall Street. The company announced Monday that it will go public in the United States through a $1.2 billion merger with Vine Hill Capital Investment Corp (VCIC)., a Nasdaq-listed SPAC. The deal shifts CoinShares’ listing from Stockholm to New York, opening access to U.S. capital markets and investors. The firm manages about $10 billion in assets, including a suite of 32 crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs) covering bitcoin, ether, solana and other tokens. CoinShares ranks as the fourth-largest global provider of digital asset ETPs, behind BlackRock, Grayscale and Fidelity, and holds a 34% share of the European, Middle Eastern and African market. Chief Executive Jean-Marie Mognetti said the move reflects a turning point for digital assets as U.S. regulation provides more clarity. “The case for digital assets as an investment class has reached a decisive inflection point,” he said. “A U.S. listing will reinforce our credibility and expand our reach.” For U.S. investors, the transaction could mean greater access to crypto-linked products from a manager that has grown assets more than 200% over the last two years. CoinShares reported a 76% adjusted EBITDA margin in the first half of 2025, signaling strong profitability compared with peers. The deal, approved by both companies’ boards, is expected to close by the end of 2025 pending regulatory and shareholder approvals. If completed, CoinShares will trade on Nasdaq under a new parent company, Odysseus Holdings Limited.

Title: Fidelity Launches New Tokenized Fund as Market Nears $300B: Why Are Traders Joining Best Wallet Token?

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Fidelity introduced the Fidelity Digital Interest Token (FDIT), an Ethereum-based tokenized share of the U.S. Treasury securities and cash equivalents, on August 4, 2025. This marks Fidelity’s official entry into the landscape of tokenized real-world assets (RWAs). Earlier this month, the funds have spiraled to over $200M in assets. However, there has been minimal investor participation so far. Records show that only two holders have been identified so far — one holds almost $1M in tokens, and the other manages the rest. While Fidelity hasn’t made any official announcement yet, the Institution’s earlier SEC filing may have laid the groundwork for this launch. Nonetheless, this step signals its growing interest in real-world asset (RWAs) tokenization. And it certainly paves the way for more crypto adoption from institutions and retail users alike. As the past has shown, this often translates to positive chart action from altcoins, and one in particular, Best Wallet Token ($BEST), is making waves now. FDIT is an ERC-20 token that offers 24/7 transferability and several other exclusive features tailored for institutional investors. It invests in short-duration U.S. Treasury securities via the underlying OUSG token. Since its launch in August 2025, the Bank of New York Mellon has held the FDIT’s assets, ensuring traditional financial oversight. FDIT charges an annual management fee of 0.20% with no performance fees and is currently available exclusively to institutional investors. Fidelity’s token launch also marks the integration of blockchain technology into the traditional finance sector—a trend that improves liquidity, transparency, and increases operational efficiency. According to recent trends from Token Terminal, tokenized real-world assets have surpassed $300B, a milestone expected to be reached by 2030. Another report by RedStone states that RWAs on-chain could reach up to $30T by 2034. Furthermore, the recent FDIT launch signals the growing trust in Ethereum-based financial products. These trends, along with FDIT’s choice of Ethereum, reassure investors that it can handle serious, institutional-grade assets while also acting on the strong crypto vision many others (like Strategy) are sharing. Ultimately, this highlights that traditional finance is embracing blockchain technology. This union lays a strong bullish landscape for Ethereum-based projects. Building on this momentum, the Best Wallet Token ($BEST) presale gives investors the best entryway to a growing Ethereum ecosystem. Let’s see why. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is the utility token of Best Wallet, a non-custodial crypto wallet. The software-based wallet lets you buy, hold, and sell tokens on six major chains: Staking is coming soon, according to the roadmap, alongside market intel analytics, 60+ chain support, and even a Best Card for fiat transactions. Most importantly, Best Wallet is the only crypto wallet that lets you buy the best crypto presales from your mobile. No need to visit external sites! Joining the presale gives you access to premium features, like reduced transaction fees, higher staking rewards, and community governance in a DAO ecosystem. The presale has raised over $15.6M so far, with a $70K whale buy on September 2 that indicates growing retail interest. The token is currently $0.025605 but our Best Wallet Token price prediction forecasts a price of $0.05106175 by the end of 2026, almost a 2x purely by holding the token. The presale concludes by December 31, 2025, or once all the tokens are sold. So, there’s still time to buy one of the best altcoins of 2025. To buy Best Wallet Token, visit the official presale page or read our ‘How to Buy $BEST’ guide! Fidelity’s FDIT launch reflects the growing institutional confidence in Ethereum-based financial products, emphasizing the potential of tokenized assets and their ability to transform traditional finance. As blockchain adoption gains momentum, investors are exploring early-stage investment opportunities like Best Wallet Token ($BEST), which capitalizes on the nascent stage of blockchain adoption. But remember that crypto is volatile, and this is not financial advice. Do your own research!

Title: Circle’s Revenue At Risk As Hyperliquid Opens Auction For USDH
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomerniv/2025/09/08/circles-revenue-at-risk-as-hyperliquid-opens-auction-for-usdh/
Time Published: 2025-09-08T11:25:11Z
Full Content:
ByTomer Niv, Contributor. Hyperliquid, the lightning-fast decentralized exchange that has captured more than 75% of the DeFi perpetuals market, is making its boldest move yet. Powered by its custom HyperCore chain, the platform can settle trades in under a quarter of a second and process hundreds of thousands of orders per second - performance that fueled $400 billion in trading volume in August 2025 alone. But Hyperliquid now wants more than just speed and liquidity - it wants control of the stablecoin layer at the heart of its ecosystem. That ambition takes shape with USDH, a proposed dollar-pegged stablecoin designed to redirect yield from the nearly $5 billion in deposits that currently enrich Circle’s USDC back into Hyperliquid’s own community. Instead of issuing the coin itself, Hyperliquid has turned the process into a public on-chain auction: issuers must openly compete, disclosing how much of the yield they will share, their compliance strategy, and the infrastructure they bring. Validators, acting as the decision-makers, will deliberate in public and then cast binding votes on-chain. This is more than a cost-saving move - it’s a DeFi governance experiment. Hyperliquid is effectively importing procurement practices from traditional finance into DeFi, forcing would-be issuers to compete on transparency, economics, and trust. The signal is unmistakable: USDH is being built to serve Hyperliquid’s community first, not an outside issuer’s bottom line. Until now, Hyperliquid’s rise has been fueled by USDC, Circle’s widely adopted dollar-backed stablecoin. Roughly 95% of the assets sitting on Hyperliquid are denominated in USDC, making the exchange one of Circle’s largest institutional “clients.” That amounts to nearly 7–8% of all USDC in circulation, a share so large it rivals major centralized exchanges. The revenue implications are enormous. Circle earns virtually all of its income by investing USDC reserves in short-term treasuries and money-market funds. According to public filings, more than 99% of Circle’s $1.68 billion in 2024 revenue came from this interest spread. If those reserves migrate into USDH, Circle faces a sudden loss of $150–200 million per year - roughly 10% of its business. That risk is amplified by timing. Circle has been working to launch native USDC and its cross-chain transfer protocol (CCTP) on Hyperliquid, but delays left a window for USDH to seize the spotlight. The result: Circle, once the indispensable backbone of on-chain finance, now finds itself on the defensive. The USDH initiative isn’t just about reclaiming yield - it’s about rethinking how a decentralized protocol negotiates with its partners. By opening a public auction, Hyperliquid is treating the role of stablecoin issuer like a high-stakes procurement contract. Every bidder must explain how reserves will be managed, how much of the interest will flow back to the community, and what extra services they bring. The process mirrors corporate RFQs and government bond auctions, except that here it all plays out transparently on-chain. Validators, who stake HYPE tokens to secure the network, are the hiring committee. Their vote will determine not only who mints USDH but also how billions in yield are redistributed. For Hyperliquid, the motivation is straightforward. Why let Circle capture the spoils when those same billions could fund HYPE buybacks, validator rewards, and liquidity incentives? For DeFi at large, it is a glimpse of how governance can evolve from token votes on fee switches to community-controlled negotiations over billion-dollar contracts. Several issuers have thrown their hats into the ring, but three frontrunners stand out - each offering validators a different trade-off between trust, ethos, and firepower. Paxos: The Compliance Titan Frax Finance: The DeFi Native Agora: The Institutional Heavyweight Smaller entrants such as Native Markets and Konelia also submitted designs, but they have drawn limited validator support. The real decision lies between Paxos’ compliance clout, Frax’s community-first ethos, and Agora’s institutional scale. For Circle, the outcome could be devastating. Losing Hyperliquid’s billions would erase up to 10% of its revenue overnight, exposing its dependence on interest income and underscoring its vulnerability to client defection. CEO Jeremy Allaire has argued that USDC’s liquidity and interoperability will preserve its dominance, but the market isn’t convinced. Hyperliquid has demonstrated that if a protocol can align stablecoin incentives with its users, loyalty to USDC is far from guaranteed. For DeFi, the process is arguably more significant than the outcome. Hyperliquid has created a model where protocols can force vendors to compete in the open - on yield, compliance, liquidity, and governance. Instead of relying on closed-door deals, decentralized communities can now decide for themselves who manages their reserves. The USDH saga is a turning point in how decentralized platforms negotiate with centralized issuers. Hyperliquid has leveraged its balance sheet to flip the script, making issuers fight for access to its ecosystem and share their profits with the community. For Circle, it’s a wake-up call: the days of capturing billions in risk-free yield without sharing are numbered. For Hyperliquid, it’s a chance to transform USDC dependence into a self-reinforcing growth engine. And for the broader crypto industry, it’s a blueprint for how governance can evolve from symbolic token votes to billion-dollar procurement battles fought transparently on-chain. On September 14, Hyperliquid’s validators will decide which bidder mints USDH. Whichever way the vote goes, the precedent has been set: in the new era of DeFi, power flows to the protocols that control the capital - and they’re no longer willing to give it away for free.

Ethereum’s RWA crown tested as Fidelity steps into BlackRock’s Treasury turf. Ethereum holds 70% of the tokenized Treasury market. FDIT entered the top 10 with $203 million inflows, while BlackRock’s BUIDL shed $150 million. Ethereum [ETH] dominated 70% of the tokenized U.S. Treasury market. In numbers, $5.3 billion in tokenized Treasuries, bonds, and cash equivalents are flowing on Ethereum, accounting for over 70% of the total $7.46 billion tokenized Treasury market. Now, Fidelity has joined this sector of nearly 50 different tokenized U.S. Treasury offerings with the Fidelity Digital Interest Token (FDIT). The question is whether FDIT will pump more utility and liquidity into ETH’s DeFi stack. Sure, Fidelity’s making waves, but it’s not the first mover in the RWA game. The real heavyweight? BlackRock’s BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), which still runs the show, with a solid $2.2 billion market cap in the tokenized Treasury space across multiple networks. Fidelity’s FDIT, by contrast, dropped solo on Ethereum. Within a short period, it grew to $203.7 million in assets and entered the top 10 Treasury products. Source: Rwa.xyz/treasuries Peep the 7-day flows: BUIDL was bleeding about $150 million, while FDIT was pulling in fresh liquidity left and right. That kind of on-chain rotation cements FDIT’s positioning, even in a crowded tokenized Treasury pool. In short, FDIT’s drop has seen solid on-chain adoption. Each token represents a share of FYOXX, backed by U.S. Treasuries. The bigger play? Ethereum’s still flexing as the go-to layer for institutional RWAs in DeFi. Tokenized U.S. Treasuries make up nearly 27% of the RWA stack. In other words, over a quarter of all on-chain RWAs are locked in low-risk, yield-bearing Treasury assets. This highlights just how dominant these U.S. gov-backed tokens are in DeFi’s real-world asset play. In this context, FDIT cracking the top 20 RWA assets isn’t a fluke. It’s proof of strong on-chain demand for tokenized Treasury products, with Ethereum devs clearly front-running the institutional RWA wave. Source: Rwa.xyz/networks/ethereum Right now, no chain comes close to Ethereum’s Treasury stack. ETH flexes 70% dominance, while Stellar lags at 6%, underscoring Ethereum’s grip. In fact, even after 95% stablecoin dominance, Treasuries still pull 3.15% of ETH’s market, showing serious on-chain RWA muscle. Fidelity’s move with FDIT just reinforces this. Dropping it on Ethereum taps into the network’s liquidity and dev infrastructure. Consequently, it allows them to stack market share and bolster their DeFi presence.

Title: Is efficiency misunderstood?

Time Published: 2025-09-08T08:03:55Z

Energy efficiency drives sustainability, control, and competitive growth When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. When it comes to energy, terms like 'frugal’ or ‘efficiency’ can be perceived as ‘going without' or suggest having to make do with less. The reality is the opposite. Efficiency often improves our experience. In a world where energy demand is rising, becoming more volatile and costly, and climate pressures remain ever-present, efficiency offers more potential than ever. It’s no longer just a matter of operational performance. It’s about speed, comfort but also resilience, competitiveness, sustainability, and, increasingly, it’s about better control. Energy efficiency shouldn’t be viewed as a side benefit, but as the foundation for smarter growth. It should be seen as a powerful industry in its own right, and a crucial thread that runs through the success of other sectors. It’s what enables buildings, industries, and entire cities to function more intelligently and more sustainably for better life quality. Efficiency today is dynamic, digital, and deeply human. And unlocking it is one of the most powerful things we can do to accelerate the transition to a low-carbon future while strengthening the systems we rely on every day. Businesses must evolve their mindset and see efficiency not just as a vehicle for cost savings, but as a fundamental driver of operations. EVP Energy Management, Schneider Electric. The traditional definition of efficiency—squeezing more value from fewer resources—remains relevant. But it’s also not enough. It’s about doing better—smarter operations, stronger margins, sharper control. It can also be the fastest and most cost-effective path to decarbonization. In fact, its importance to hitting our net zero goals, has seen the IEA declare energy efficiency the “first fuel” of clean energy transitions. In advanced economies, the bulk of efficiency savings are found through upgrading older infrastructure with new, more efficient solutions—things we’ve all heard of like switching to LEDs. However, more significant changes can and should be made to promote efficiency, from improving building efficiency to replacing HVAC systems. The IEA projected in 2021 that improving energy efficiency could deliver a reduction in annual energy-related emissions of 3.5 Gt CO2-eq (12%) compared with 2017 levels, delivering more than 40% of the abatement required to be in line with the Paris Agreement. The climate impact of efficiency is significant, but the wider impact to your organization is why it should be on your radar. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! As part of our decarbonization journey, efficiency might be the first fuel, but it’s the combination of electrification and digitalization, or what we call Electricity 4.0, that is supercharging its potential. Alone, each makes an impact. When combined, they are transformative, redefining efficiency across industries, cities and households. Electrification replaces fossil-fuel-based systems with electric alternatives—we’re seeing lots of examples of this in our day-to-day lives with things like heat pumps, EVs or even induction hobs. But these changes can also be at an industrial scale with changes to process heating in energy intensive applications. These technologies are inherently more efficient and, when powered by renewables, dramatically reduce emissions. While a powerful part of decarbonization, electrification’s impact is magnified with digital solutions. The digital revolution has transformed the way we understand and manage energy. Smart sensors, connected devices, and advanced analytics provide unprecedented visibility into how, when, and where energy is used. This data-driven approach enables organizations to identify inefficiencies and remedy them. But beyond this, digital tools can manage electricity demand and balance loads dynamically. This allows energy users to be more in control and actively manage demand to when renewable generation is highest – which is something traditional systems just cannot manage. Take your home for example. If you install energy management, such as smart thermostats, you save energy (and reduce energy bills) by applying energy exactly where you need it. As a result, not only do you save costs and carbon, you also get precise control and comfort, having rooms the exact temperature you want (vs just cold, warm or hot). These systems can even be enhanced with AI, incorporating weather forecasting to know that tomorrow will be warmer than today, so the boiler can start a bit later to reach your desired temperatures (saving even more energy and cost). What was once viewed purely as a cost-saving tactic is now becoming a steppingstone for organizations striving to become more competitive, and we’ve shown some of the ways you can increase efficiency and move to a more electric and digital approach. Energy efficiency no longer deserves to be relegated to an afterthought or a box ticking exercise. It belongs in boardroom strategies—driving profitability, resilience and brand strength. Businesses that use less energy are less exposed to price volatility and fossil fuel supply chain disruptions. And with smart, electrified systems, they can even participate in new energy markets—and even move into the prosumer space, becoming both consumers and producers of energy. This shift helps to future proof key elements of an organization’s cash flow and operations. However, the value of energy efficiency transcends the bottom line. Energy efficient operations are increasingly a signal of innovation and responsibility, resonating with customers, investors and regulators. It’s no surprise, then, that in their 2024 Investor Letter, BlackRock said companies that show a clear commitment to sustainability and efficiency are more likely to attract long-term capital. It bears reiterating that investing in efficiency is investing in a long-term saving. For many it’s also investing in more modern equipment which can offer a myriad of side benefits that weren’t previously considered within the move. But the long-term saving on energy bills can see knock on reductions in maintenance costs. Whether you’re counting savings in MWhs or dollars, you’re not counting the right thing with energy efficiency today. Instead, you should be looking at additional available spend for training, R&D or global expansion. You should be counting additional hours saved through better maintenance schedules or increased productivity due to a happier, healthier workforce. What you once knew to be true of efficiency isn’t wrong, it’s just too narrow for the value it can deliver today We've listed the best green web hosting.

Title: How Rich Is Ethereum Co-Founder Vitalik Buterin Really? Arkham’s 2025 Report
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/how-rich-ethereum-co-founder-vitalik-buterin-2025/
Time Published: 2025-09-08T07:30:00Z
Full Content:
Arkham Intelligence’s new deep-dive, shared via X on September 6, pegs Vitalik Buterin’s wealth at “at least $1.05 billion”—a lower-bound tally built from identified on-chain assets and known private holdings. The report situates the estimate as of August 2025 and emphasizes that it fluctuates intraday with Ether’s price. The backbone is Ether itself. Arkham attributes ~240,042 ETH to Buterin’s known wallets and notes that over 99% of his crypto portfolio value is in ETH. At the time of writing in the report, ETH was $4,321, implying roughly $1.04 billion of ETH exposure alone and explaining the tight co-movement between his net worth and ETH’s market cycle. Historically, Arkham reconstructs a precise balance-history curve. On December 31, 2015, Buterin’s known crypto wealth stood at $596,760; by December 31, 2016 it was $4.23 million, then $278.37 million a year later—his largest year-over-year jump in the 2017 bull run. He first crossed the on-chain billionaire mark at age 27 during 2021 as ETH traded above $3,000, and briefly peaked at $2.09 billion on November 18, 2021 with ETH near its cycle high. The subsequent bear market slashed the mark-to-market value by roughly 75%, from $1.2 billion (Dec 31, 2021) to $300.58 million (Dec 31, 2022), before recovering to $1.05 billion in the 2024–2025 rebound. “The peak of Vitalik’s crypto net worth was in May 2021, when 50% of the supply of the memecoin SHIB was sent to him and was briefly worth $20 Billion. Vitalik donated those tokens to charity and did not profit off of this memecoin,” Arkham writes. On ownership concentration, Arkham compares Buterin to other top-tier ETH holders. The ETH2 (Beacon) deposit contract leads with 66,887,347.41 ETH, followed by exchange and ETF-custody clusters (Coinbase, Binance, Kraken, Robinhood, Grayscale, BlackRock). Arkham concludes Buterin is the largest identifiable individual with access to his coins, while Estonian banker Rain Lõhmus sits on ~250,000 ETH that are believed to be inaccessible due to lost keys. The Ethereum co-founder’s own disclosures anchor the percentages. In October 2018 he wrote: “I never had 900k ETH. When I had 0.9% of all ETH, the supply was ~75 million.” That statement frames Arkham’s finding that his share never materially exceeded ~0.9% and has trended down over time as he sold or donated and as supply evolved. Non-ETH positions are small in dollar terms but spelled out with exact counts. As of publication, Arkham shows 10,000,000,000 WHITE (~$3.72 million), 30,000,000,000 MOODENG (~$690,000), and 869,509 KNC (~$327,000) among his larger non-ETH tokens. The long tail includes $12,400 of TORN linked to Tornado Cash usage and 218,413,000 SHIB (~$2,720) remaining on known addresses. Buterin has publicly explained some of the flows that complicate “sales” tallies. In August 2022 he stated, “I’ll out myself as someone who has used [Tornado Cash] to donate to this exact cause,” referring to donations to Ukraine; he has also said that exchange-bound transfers from his wallets since 2018 have been for donations, not personal profit-taking. Off-chain, Arkham highlights early equity in zero-knowledge firm StarkWare, which reached an $8 billion valuation in its 2022 Series D—an illiquid but potentially meaningful additive to the on-chain floor. Precise sizing of these stakes is not disclosed, so Arkham treats the $1.05 billion as a conservative baseline rather than a cap. At press time, Ethereum traded at $4,298.

Title: Forbes Asia 20th Anniversary Retrospective

ByForbes Asia Team, Forbes Staff. When Forbes Asia launched in September 2005, it marked the start of a dedicated focus on, as we then described it, the world’s most economically dynamic region. Over the past two decades our network of reporters and editors has documented the titans and companies forming the backbone of Asia’s economies and creating the wealth that has underpinned regional growth. We’ve journeyed with our readers through China’s prosperity boom and slowdown, India’s transformation under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, ASEAN’s trade and economic expansion, the fallout of the 2008 global financial crisis, and, most recently, the aftermath of the Covid-19 epidemic. As the trusted chronicler of wealth, we’ve tracked the explosion in the number of billionaires in this region. There were 115 Asians worth a collective $364 billion on our World’s Billionaires list of 2006. This tally has since soared. In the 2025 rankings, there were a total of 1,046 billionaires from the Asia-Pacific, collectively worth $4.2 trillion. China (including Hong Kong) and India had the second- and third-largest number of billionaires in the world after the U.S., with 516 and 205, respectively. Our dozen country rich lists, where the typical minimum net worth requirement of $1 billion does not apply, cast a wider net, though in China and India that sum is no longer enough to earn a berth among their 100 richest. We drilled deeper to uncover top-performing businesses (and future billionaires) through our annual Best Under A Billion list, which highlights 200 publicly listed small and midsized companies with sales below $1 billion. In 2012 we kicked off an annual roster to celebrate the growing presence of Asia’s power businesswomen. And 2016 saw the debut of a regional 30 Under 30 list to foreground young achievers, including entrepreneurs, artists and athletes. Our 100 to Watch list of small companies and startups on the rise was launched five years ago. The accompanying pages showcase many of the moguls featured on our covers over the past 20 years whose achievements have contributed to planting Asia firmly on the global economic map. Edited by Mary E. Scott We shadowed India-born, U.S.-based venture capitalist Promod Haque of Norwest Venture Partners as he crisscrossed his homeland searching for high-tech gold. In his 35-year career, Haque rolled the dice on some 70 companies, roughly 10% in India, with a combined exit value of $40 billion. That put him on the Forbes Midas List of top VCs more than a dozen times. Now in a part-time role at Norwest, the 77-year-old still believes India provides ample “opportunity for great investment success.” This compendium of Asia-Pacific’s 200 top-performing small and midsized companies with annual revenue under $1 billion often has titans in the making. Notable alumni of the Best Under A Billion list over the years range from China’s Alibaba, Baidu and Tencent to Malaysia’s AirAsia and the Philippines’ Jollibee to India’s Infosys and Biocon. We highlighted Singapore Airlines in the aftermath of the SARS epidemic, when it posted profits amid high fuel prices and a threat from Dubai-based Emirates. It has since won accolades as one of the world’s best carriers. In 2024, we revisited the airline after it had scooped up a 25% stake in the privatized Air India, partnering with the Tata conglomerate. Net profit hit a record $2.8 billion in the year to March 31, though the Air India bet has yet to pay off. U.S.-educated brothers Victor and William Fung were named our 2006 businessmen of the year for converting their family company, Li & Fung, into a world-class enterprise connecting American and European consumers to factories in 40 countries. While they still retain significant stakes, Victor’s son Spencer is now group executive chairman. In 2020, the family partnered with Singapore logistics firm GLP to take Li & Fung private, delisting it from the Hong Kong stock exchange after a 28-year run. Korean skincare and cosmetics maker Amorepacific drew our attention long before the K-beauty phenomenon exploded, with products now routinely flogged by influencers on social media. In 2015, we named its billionaire chairman and CEO, Suh Kyung-bae, grandson of the founder, as businessman of the year. Today, as Americans panic buy their favorite K-beauty brands before the Trump tariffs hit, the company’s $3 billion in annual revenue looks set to get a lift. Nandan Nilekani was facing a problem at Infosys, the software company he cofounded: hiring 28,500 people in one year. In today’s AI world, the Indian IT behemoth has reportedly slowed recruitment. More than 80% of the 324,000 people it employs—up fivefold since 2006—are tagged “AI aware.” Nilekani left Infosys in 2009 to work with the government to build Aadhaar, India’s mammoth identity card scheme. A boardroom shake-up eight years later brought him back to Infosys as chairman. We profiled Li Ka-shing, nicknamed Superman, who at the time was the richest man in Asia and running his telecom-to-ports empire with an eye on China expansion. Today the 97-year-old’s CK Hutchison, from which he retired as chairman but remains as senior advisor, is in the throes of a complex $23 billion deal to sell its port assets, including two at the Panama Canal, which is strategically important to both the Americans and Chinese. The possible buyer is a consortium that includes U.S. investment firm BlackRock and, potentially, state-owned China Cosco Shipping. Li, who got his start making plastic flowers, is now among Asia’s richest with a $40 billion fortune. Vaccine billionaire Cyrus Poonawalla, founder of privately held Serum Institute of India, was the face of our 2007 list of 50 richest Indians. By 2014, the roster had expanded to 100 and each had to be worth at least $1 billion to qualify. In 2020, when the pandemic shut down the world, Poonawalla’s son Adar stepped up to produce a Covid-19 vaccine licensed from AstraZeneca. Last year was a record breaker for the list: the combined wealth of India’s 100 richest surpassed $1 trillion for the first time. When we met with Edwin Soeryadjaya, he was dead set on restoring the family fortune, wiped out when his father sold a stake in automotive group Astra to bail out a bank that was run by another son. Soeryadjaya rebuilt the clan’s wealth largely through a stake in coal miner Adaro. Lately he’s been greening his portfolio with solar and carbon-offset investments. Nvidia was named company of the year when the California-based chipmaker’s graphics processors were revolutionizing how we watched TV, gamed and used the internet. Today, the company is making a bigger killing as the supplier of the world’s most powerful AI chips, propelling its market cap to over $4 trillion. Founder and CEO Jensen Huang’s wealth has ballooned to $157 billion, making him the world’s seventh-richest person. In 2020, Hong Kong billionaire Francis Choi put his money behind biodegradable plastics to make environmentally friendly toys. This was a break from 2007, when Choi’s Early Light Industrial’s China-made toys for Mattel were found to contain lead paint. The “King of Toys” now has broader interests, from property to luxury watch retailing. Unfazed by the global financial crisis, brandy billionaire Andrew Tan teamed up with Malaysian gaming tycoon Lim Kok Thay’s Genting to invest $1.6 billion in building two casino resorts to make Manila the next Monte Carlo. While the partnership ended in 2023, it was a smart bet for Tan. Last year, the Philippines hit a record $7 billion in gross gaming revenue, higher than Singapore’s estimated $6 billion but dwarfed by the $27 billion for Macau, still the world’s top gambling city. Just months after featuring on our cover, William Amelio stepped down as CEO of Lenovo after a four-year stint; Yang Yuanqing—who in 2004 transformed Lenovo into a global tech player by buying IBM’s PC business for over $1 billion—was reinstated in his place, and founder Liu Chuanzi returned as chairman. The leadership overhaul came after sales plunged and the company slid into the red. Today, Lenovo is the world’s No. 1 PC maker in unit terms, up from No. 4 in 2008. Yang is CEO, chairman, and a billionaire. Liu is honorary chairman. Tadashi Yanai’s goal was to have more people wear his threads than those made by rivals Gap, H&M and Zara owner Inditex. He has since nearly tripled Uniqlo’s store network to some 2,500 outlets worldwide. Based on its $21 billion revenue for fiscal 2024, Yanai’s Fast Retailing has trounced Gap, is closing in on H&M, but has still to catch up with Inditex. Yanai, who became Japan’s richest person in 2009 and is now worth $45 billion, has said that he spends the bulk of his time mentoring potential successors. Our World’s Billionaires List saw a wealth meltdown in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, and India’s Gautam Adani was no exception. We met the commodities-and-infrastructure tycoon three months after he’d narrowly survived a terror attack by gunmen in a Mumbai hotel. Atop a shipping container at his Mundra port, Adani posed gamely for our photographer. He went on to greater heights, briefly surpassing the likes of Jeff Bezos, Warren Buffett and fellow Indian Mukesh Ambani in 2022 to become the world’s second-richest person, worth $143 billion. Months later, that went into freefall when U.S. firm Hindenburg Research accused Adani and his companies of financial fraud and stock market manipulation, allegations the businessman denied. His wealth has climbed again since, though not to the same stratospheric level. One year after we profiled Baidu cofounder and CEO Robin Li, Google quit China amid a cyberattack and concerns about censorship, clearing the way for Baidu to become the mainland’s top search engine. The homegrown internet giant has waded into cloud computing and is investing heavily in AI with a ChatGPT-like service called Ernie. Australian trucking billionaire Lindsay Fox declared that the global economic downturn had delivered a record year for his privately owned Linfox, a mover of goods across Asia-Pacific: “Everyone’s eating more at home, everyone’s drinking, and everybody who’s a miner is digging.” A decade later, Covid-19 was a mixed bag. Linfox snagged a government contract to transport tens of millions of vaccines but profits were hit by higher supply chain costs. Fox, 88, has handed running of the business to son and executive chairman Peter. Quitting his career as a banker, Singapore’s Simon Cheong plunged into property development, founding SC Global in 1996 to build ultra-luxury properties, well before the influx of the wealthy from overseas turned into a flood. Known for his meticulous attention to detail, Cheong set a then-record with the Marq, where a four-bedroom unit fetched $16 million in 2011. Tony Fernandes single-handedly made air travel affordable for millions of people when he relaunched AirAsia as a no-frills carrier in 2001. The journey’s been bumpy at times, but the former music industry executive is still flying high as CEO of Capital A, the holding company for the Malaysia-based airline. Charles Chao, CEO of news and entertainment portal Sina, launched microblog Weibo just as Twitter (now X) and Facebook (now Meta) were banned in China. Weibo took off, becoming a forum for popular opinion since surging to 600 million active monthly users. But its Nasdaq-listed shares are down about 90% from a high of $142 in 2018, battered by a massive data breach in 2020 and a weak advertising market. Our reporter tagged along with Jackie Chan as he raced around Asia combining his job as an action movie celebrity with charitable works, which put him on our annual Heroes of Philanthropy list. His Jackie Chan Charitable Foundation, launched in 1988, offers scholarships to students as well as medical services and aid during natural disasters. In 2004, he kicked off his Dragon’s Heart Foundation to build schools and help the elderly in remote parts of mainland China. Chan has said he plans to give his estimated $400 million fortune to charity when he dies. Thailand’s richest person, Dhanin Chearavanont, was then busy hatching a plan for his Charoen Pokphand group, an early mover in China, to build megafarms to feed the country’s growing middle class. In 2024, the group’s Bangkok-listed CP Foods unit drew two-thirds of its $18 billion revenue from overseas. Dhanin stepped back from running his agribusiness-to-telecoms conglomerate in 2017, handing charge to his two sons, though he remains senior chairman. Teresita Sy-Coson was the cover star for our inaugural Asia’s Power Businesswomen list. More than a decade later she remains at the top of the Sy family’s SM Investments holding company, building on the vision of her father, founder Henry Sy, who died in 2019. In the 20 years since listing on the Philippine Stock Exchange, the retail, banking and property conglomerate has seen its shares soar almost sevenfold. Vincent Tan brought McDonald’s to Malaysia, laying the foundation for Berjaya, a retail, property and financial services group that made him one of the country’s richest people. But in 2012, on turning 60, Tan took a back seat to embark on a new mission, helping ordinary Malaysians speak better English. Tan returned as Berjaya’s executive chairman five years later, moving into an advisory role in 2023. He reportedly plans to donate half his estimated $800 million fortune to charity. At the time, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC), founded by Morris Chang in 1987, was growing fast, driven by surging demand for its chips for smartphones and tablets. Today, the AI boom is fueling sales at one of the world’s largest chipmakers, with Apple and Nvidia among its biggest customers. With substantial investments in the U.S., TSMC is likely to be exempted from Trump’s tariffs. Chang, 94, who has long since retired, was named by Forbes in 2017 as one of the 100 Greatest Living Business Minds. Peter Woo, one of Hong Kong’s ten richest people, spoke to us at a time when Hong Kongers were complaining about the influx of mainland Chinese visitors. The owner of two flagship shopping malls, whose wealth had doubled in a year to $8 billion thanks to the shopping frenzy, was more welcoming. Two years later, Woo handed charge of his holding company, Wheelock, to son Douglas. We outed Pham Nhat Vuong, founder and chairman of Vingroup, one of Vietnam’s largest conglomerates, as the country’s first billionaire. The self-made Vuong, now worth around $13 billion and the country’s richest person, has been on an expansion binge since, muscling into everything from EVs to renewable energy and hotels. In June, Vingroup revealed plans to build a $14 billion port-and-logistics hub outside Hanoi, where it is based. The founder and executive chairperson of Biocon, which made her the richest self-made woman in India when it went public in 2004, has poured her energy and resources into making a range of low-cost drugs, including for chronic diseases. After losing a friend to cancer, Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw set up a cancer center in Bangalore as well as centers for advanced therapeutics and research. Shaw, now 72, whose late husband, John, was also a cancer patient, has pledged to leave 75% of her $3.3 billion wealth to charity. Chew Gek Khim wrested control of Singapore’s Straits Trading in 2008 after a high-profile bidding war with OCBC’s Lee family. Then she got busy revamping the staid colonial-era tin smelter into a sleek 21st-century holding company, broadening its activities to include property, hospitality and asset management. Known for her signature cheongsams, Chew still runs the show as executive chairman. Neil Shen cofounded Sequoia Capital China in 2005, at a time when Chinese internet companies were way behind their American counterparts, and turned it into an investment juggernaut. The key, disclosed the China-born, Yale-educated Shen, was to understand Chinese culture and business practices. Sequoia Capital China was split from its Silicon Valley parent in 2024 and renamed HongShan Capital Group, or HSG, where Shen is founder and managing partner. The billionaire investor has been on our Midas list more than a dozen times. Piyush Gupta retired as CEO of Singapore’s DBS in March, more than a decade after he shared with us his plan to turn the stodgy local bank into a nimble regional player by digitalizing its services. The bank has been named the world’s best digital bank several times and continues to harness cutting-edge technology such as blockchain and AI. Gupta handed charge to DBS veteran Tan Su Shan, who earned a place on our Asia’s Power Businesswomen list in 2024. Lei Jun, founder, chairman and CEO of China’s Xiaomi, which made smartphones affordable for hundreds of millions of people, was a shoo-in for our businessman of the year. Xiaomi, which means “small rice” in Mandarin, was founded in 2010. Since our sit-down with Lei, it has expanded its portfolio to include wearables, IoT devices and more recently, EVs. Lei’s $42 billion fortune makes him China’s sixth-richest person today. This issue was largely dedicated to Singapore’s founding father, Lee Kuan Yew, who died March 23, 2015. Remembered by Steve Forbes and others as one of the great statesmen of the post-WWII era, LKY was a clear-eyed pragmatist with superb political skills who built Singapore into the economic powerhouse it is today. LKY also shared his views with our readers as a Forbes columnist for 15 years, starting in 2001. The then-34-year-old Frank Wang was the world’s first drone billionaire, having amassed a fortune with DJI, the company he founded in 2006 and ran out of his dorm room at a Hong Kong university. Today, Shenzhen-based DJI continues to dominate the consumer-drone space, giving Wang a net worth of $5.4 billion. Nepal’s first, and only, billionaire, Binod Chaudhary, raced to the rescue when a 7.8 Richter-scale earthquake devastated the country, distributing essentials in the immediate aftermath, including his company’s Wai Wai instant noodles, and helping longer term with rebuilding. His Chaudhary Foundation, the philanthropic arm of his CG Corp Global conglomerate, was set up in 1995 to support education, disaster management and healthcare, particularly for children. The year marked our first 30 Under 30 Asia list of the Millennials making good in this part of the world. Ten editions later, the roster continues to showcase young entrepreneurs, innovators and artists who are disrupting their chosen fields; only now, Gen Z is taking over, with nearly half of the 2025 cohort aged 27 or under. We flagged Nita Ambani, wife of Mukesh Ambani, chairman and managing director of Reliance Industries, as the first lady of Indian business and an Asian power businesswoman. At the time, she was a Reliance director, overseeing the launch and branding of telecoms arm Jio, which now has almost 500 million subscribers. Though she retired from the board in 2023 as her children stepped up, she remains chairperson of philanthropic arm Reliance Foundation and is even more visible today. Nita shows up at Premier League cricket matches, rooting for Reliance’s Mumbai Indians team. As a member of the International Olympic Committee, she’s lobbying for the Games to be held in India. A prominent cultural and convention center in Mumbai that was her brainchild bears her name. Hary Tanoesoedibjo, founder and executive chairman of Media Nusantara Citra group, is sometimes called Indonesia’s Donald Trump. Hary (as local media call him) built a fortune in real estate and TV broadcasting and likes to post on social media. He also happens to be the U.S. president’s business partner, owning several Trump-branded resorts in Indonesia. Hary attended the 2017 presidential inauguration and was hobnobbing in Washington D.C. when Trump was sworn in for his second term. He had ambitions to become Indonesia’s president but gave control of the political party he founded to daughter Angela last year. Sonia Cheng grew up in hotels owned by New World Development, a property company founded by her grandfather, Cheng Yu-tung. Under her guidance as CEO, its Rosewood Hotels brand, acquired in 2011, was quickly becoming one of the world’s fastest-growing upscale hotel chains. It now manages 33 properties, including The Carlyle in New York and Hotel de Crillon in Paris, with 27 more being developed. In 2022 Cheng also took on the role of co-vice chairman at Chow Tai Fook Jewellery, the Cheng family’s crown jewel. Meanwhile, New World has been weighed down lately by debt. What was only a dream in 2017 is now reality: Wang Chuanfu’s BYD is the largest EV maker in the world in terms of auto sales. The company’s 2024 revenue exceeded $100 billion, blowing past chief rival Tesla. However, BYD’s shares are off the all-time high they hit in May as investors worry about an EV price war. Joseph Tsai, cofounder and then-executive vice chairman of e-commerce giant Alibaba, had a slam-dunk year in 2017. Of note: his high-profile acquisition of 49% of the Brooklyn Nets basketball team for $1 billion. Three years later, the sports fan paid nearly $1.4 billion for the remaining stake. (He has since sold part of his holding but maintains control.) Tsai rose to chairman of Alibaba in 2023 and is now worth $11.5 billion. We were among the first to spot standout executive Jane Jie Sun, CEO of Trip.com Group (formerly Ctrip). She was in the midst of transforming the China-based online travel agency into a global player that today offers the gamut, from flights and hotels to rail travel and rental cars anywhere in the world. Sun still runs the company—and marathons. Referred to by his staff as “big brother Zhang,” the high school dropout became the world’s richest eatery entrepreneur after listing his Sichuan hot pot chain, Haidilao, in 2018. The business, which Zhang Yong cofounded with his wife, Shu Ping, is not quite sizzling these days. A consumer spending slump in mainland China prompted Zhang, now a Singapore citizen and resident, to diversify into other dining options as well as focus on U.S. expansion. In an exclusive interview, Eduardo Saverin, cofounder of Facebook, explained the investment mantra of B Capital Group, the venture capital firm he established with business partner Raj Ganguly. The duo, based in Singapore and Los Angeles, respectively, were out to prove that innovation can happen anywhere, not just in Silicon Valley. It certainly has. B Capital’s assets under management now stand at $8 billion, invested in more than 190 companies in sectors such as healthcare and AI. Once China’s richest person, beverage billionaire Zong Qinghou talked candidly of his efforts to rekindle sales at his privately held Hangzhou Wahaha Group with its portfolio of bottled water and milk drinks. He also spoke about his daughter, Kelly, as a potential successor. A year after Zong’s death in 2024, Kelly, who now leads Wahaha, is embroiled in an inheritance fight with three people who claim to be the late Zong’s offspring. In the year 2000, Forbes Global (the forerunner of Forbes Asia) put Jack Ma, cofounder of China’s Alibaba, on its cover when the e-commerce company had just 150 employees (vs 124,000 today). Almost two decades later, as Ma stepped down as chairman, announcing that he was switching his focus to philanthropy, he graced the cover again. The former teacher’s meteoric rise as one of China's top tech entrepreneurs earned him the Malcolm S. Forbes Lifetime Achievement Award in 2019. Martin and Peter Lee, the sons of Lee Shau Kee, then Hong Kong’s richest person, had spent less than a year as co-chairmen at the family’s property flagship, Henderson Land, when they agreed to open up about how they planned to carry the legacy forward. The patriarch’s death in March 2025 makes them co-owners of one of Hong Kong’s largest landlords at a time when the property market is in a prolonged slump. In 2020, Masayoshi Son, founder of Japanese investment giant SoftBank, had hit a wall. Some big-money bets made by his $100 billion Vision Fund had gone spectacularly south, forcing Son to divest assets to pay down debt. Today, the entrepreneur has a new vision, one focused on AI, with investments in ChatGPT creator OpenAI and chip giants Nvidia, TSMC and Intel. The result: Softbank returned to profit in fiscal 2025 after four years in the red, and a surge in its stock has made Son once again Japan’s richest person with a $54 billion fortune. When most businesses were reeling under Covid-19 lockdowns, Singapore-based Sea, an online provider of shopping, games and payment services, led by cofounder Forrest Li, was on a high. It had become Singapore’s most valuable company with a market cap of $69 billion. Today, New York Stock Exchange-listed Sea’s market cap exceeds $110 billion amid buoyant revenue from its gaming (Garena), e-commerce (Shopee) and payments (Monee) arms. Li was first covered by us as an entrepreneur to watch in 2010. Roshni Nadar Malhotra became chairperson of HCL Technologies in 2020, taking over from her billionaire father, Shiv Nadar, who cofounded the company as a garage startup in 1976. That made the former TV news producer one of the first women to lead a listed IT outfit in India and earned her a spot on our annual Asia’s Power Businesswomen list. With the successful takeover of Indonesia’s Bank Permata in 2020, third-generation president Chartsiri Sophonpanich set the stage for a significant expansion of Bangkok Bank’s regional presence. The $2.7 billion deal was the biggest in the bank’s history and marked a departure from its past strategy of growing organically. It also gave Chartsiri, who agreed to a rare interview, a way to cement his legacy at the institution cofounded by his grandfather in 1944. Grab’s group CEO, Anthony Tan, gave us the lowdown on how he planned to take his Singapore-headquartered superapp company, best known for its ride-hailing and delivery services, to the next level. His blueprint included transforming Grab, which he cofounded in 2012, into a listed entity and boosting its presence in fintech. A month later, Grab went public on the Nasdaq via a SPAC merger that valued the company at $40 billion, making it the biggest-ever listing of a Southeast Asian business. Its market cap has since halved to $21 billion. Data centers are multiplying around the world, and one person who saw the coming wave and rode it to become a multibillionaire is Otto Toto Sugiri, cofounder of DCI, Indonesia’s biggest data center operator by capacity. The serial tech entrepreneur launched the country’s first internet service provider in 1994 and is sometimes referred to as Indonesia’s Bill Gates. We sat down with GGV Capital’s Jenny Lee, the first woman to break into the top ten of the Midas ranking in 2012 and who had just completed an unbroken, 11-year run on that list. Now as senior managing partner at Granite Asia, which was split off from GGV in 2024, Singapore-based Lee’s winning streak continues. She was at No. 75 on this year’s Midas List and successfully launched Granite’s first private credit fund in May, securing more than half the targeted $500 million from anchor investors. In the Philippines, billionaire Enrique Razon, known for his twin successes in ports and casinos, was systematically building a third source of wealth: infrastructure. With interests in water utilities, hydropower, gas fields and solar farms, Razon stressed he wasn’t fazed by bureaucratic hurdles. “We’re very persistent, very aggressive. We don’t make crazy proposals. We study things very carefully.” Skyrocketing coal prices resulted in a fivefold jump in the wealth of Low Tuck Kwong, the founder of coal miner Bayan Resources, pushing him to No. 2 on our Indonesia rich list from No. 18 the year before, with a $12.1 billion fortune that has since more than doubled. Despite the global shift toward renewables, Low said he was confident the so-called black gold had a profitable future and of Bayan’s industry prospects, thanks to its low-cost base and low-emissions coal. Hong Kong developer Vincent Lo gambled big on mainland China after the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990s, ploughing money into his Xintiandi lifestyle and entertainment district in Shanghai. The bet paid off, turning his listed Shui On Land into his empire’s crown jewel. A meticulous planner, Lo chose daughter Stephanie as his successor. He continues to bet on China, despite its property distress, agreeing in June to invest in a premium Shanghai project. The wealthy Aboitiz family of the Philippines has a track record of reinventing its portfolio to keep pace with the times. We dug deep into Sabin Aboitiz’s $7 billion blueprint to expand century-old Aboitiz Equity Ventures, the country’s second-biggest electricity producer, into a banking, infrastructure and F&B powerhouse. “We’re transforming from a 100-year-old man to a 25-year-old athlete,” the fourth-generation president and CEO said. Malaysian billionaire brothers Lee Yeow Chor and Lee Yeow Seng, who inherited palm oil business IOI from their late father, Lee Shin Cheng, caught our eye for their bet on property in neighboring Singapore. Up next: a REIT listing that could hold as much as $6.2 billion in assets. The repositioning of Philippine F&B giant San Miguel as a nation builder by chairman Ramon Ang was a compelling story of a self-driven tycoon seeking to cement his legacy while preparing his son John Paul Ang to carry it forward. Third-generation scion Miwako Date’s strategy to double down on Mori Trust’s hotels and resorts business now looks savvy: visitors to Japan, led by the Chinese, surged 21% in the first half of 2025 to 22 million, putting the country on track to draw 45 million visitors this year, as estimated by Mori. Kuok Meng Wei, whose legendary grandfather Robert Kuok was described by Forbes as the world’s shrewdest businessman in a 1997 cover story, revealed his strategy of driving the storied Kuok Group into what he believes is the hottest industry in decades. Backed by his family, the 42-year-old’s K2 Strategic has become one of the leading builders of data centers in the region, notably in Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand. Not long after she brokered a deal with Sam Altman of OpenAI, Shina Chung, the first woman CEO of Kakao, outlined to us her plan to tap its next-gen technology for AI virtual assistants to jumpstart growth at the Korean internet giant. Nikhil Sawhney, fourth-generation successor of a Delhi clan that got its start in the sugar business, gave us the lowdown on how he transformed Triveni Turbine, a company appearing on our Best Under A Billion list for the second year, from a small domestic outfit into the world’s second-largest maker of turbines of up to 100MW capacity. His strategy: a laser focus on R&D and staying “paranoid” about competition.

Tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) are breaking records, nearing $300 billion in 2025, with some projections placing the market at $30 trillion by 2034. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. According to recent data by Token Terminal, tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) are already nearing $300 billion, a milestone that was projected to be reached in 2030. An additional report by RedStone Finance found that RWAs on-chain could hit as much as $30 trillion by 2034. While most of the momentum is made up of stablecoins like USDT and USDC, with Ethereum and Tron emerging as the big winners in asset tokenization, don’t blink and miss the broader trend: stablecoins lead, but funds are rising. On-chain funds, treasuries, and bonds are all rapidly carving out a bigger slice of the pie, moving capital markets from sleepy bank vaults onto global, blockchain rails that trade around the clock. Tokenized RWAs include much more than dollars in disguise. Earlier this week, Coinbase announced that it would launch Mag7 + Crypto Equity Index Futures to create the first US-listed futures product that combines traditional equities and crypto exposure. Government bonds like Ondo USDY and BlackRock’s BUIDL, tokenized money-market funds, gold tokens such as PAXG, and even fractionalized real estate shares are now also a reality. Commodities aren’t left behind either. There’s over $2.5 billion in digital gold, $500 million in tokenized oil, and millions in tokenized silver, agricultural goods, and even carbon credits. Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, calls tokenization a “revolution” in investing, envisioning a future where “every asset can be tokenized” and traded with global reach and instant settlement.

Stay connected via This isn’t just fintech hype. According to McKinsey and Token Terminal, institutional adoption is ramping up; tokenized RWAs alone are set to double in size as funds and treasuries jump ship to the blockchain. The move beyond stablecoins highlights a new era for capital markets, and the implications are far-reaching. Imagine having 24/7 access to traditional financial (TradFi) assets, democratized by fractional shares, with no more waiting days for trades to settle. Rather than relying on a centralized provider or a shadowy broker, every transaction is traceable and programmable, with assets directly managed on decentralized platforms, fast-tracking liquidity and efficiency. As funds and institutional assets sprint on-chain, the $300 billion milestone that was expected to be hit in 2030 marks not just growth but a sea change: the financial system is stepping off Wall Street and into global, programmable networks, changing where (and how) finance happens. Stablecoins were the start. Now, the tokenization wave is carrying funds, bonds, commodities, and even art. The next chapters? Real estate, private credit, and markets yet to be imagined, all open, frictionless, and unstoppable.

Title: Pro-XRP Lawyer Says Claims Of Coinbase Manipulating XRP Price Are ‘Highly Unlikely’

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Data from multiple blockchain trackers shows that Coinbase has drastically cut its XRP holdings, a move that has taken many crypto investors by surprise. Analysts say such a huge reduction points to large outflows from institutional investors, but others have gone further by alleging manipulation. However, pro-XRP lawyer Bill Morgan has poured cold water on these claims. US-based exchange Coinbase recently reduced its stash from more than 780 million XRP to just under 200 million in a matter of weeks. This translates to a 69% reduction in the exchange’s holdings since the second quarter of 2025, including a 57% plunge over the last month alone. The scale of the drawdown has also shifted Coinbase’s ranking among exchange holders of XRP, sliding it from the fifth largest to barely in the top 10. An account on the social media platform X, known as Stern Drew, suggested that Coinbase’s sell-offs go with a deliberate strategy to suppress XRP’s price. In a detailed thread, the commentator claimed that nearly 40% of the outflows were routed through OTC desks tied to New York institutions and that the timing of the sales coincided with XRP price dips in August. According to the thread, more than 70% of the volume was unloaded during low-liquidity trading hours, while fragmented routing across wallets masked the scale of the sales. The thread even suggested that some of the XRP ended up with BlackRock-linked custodial wallets, a move that further points to theories about institutional involvement. Bill Morgan was quick to reject the idea that Coinbase is actively manipulating XRP’s price. In his view, the theory overlooks the fact that XRP has exhibited the same behavior throughout its history, including during the long stretch when Coinbase delisted the asset and had no apparent influence on its market activity. Coinbase suspended XRP trading in January 2021, but it wasn’t until July 2023 that the cryptocurrency started trading again on the US-based exchange. “One heck of a theory about Coinbase being against XRP,” he said, before noting that the token’s movements today are consistent with its established trends. The suggestion of manipulation by Coinbase fails to hold up, as XRP’s price action appears more reflective of broader crypto market movement than any deliberate suppression by the exchange. XRP has been trading within a well-defined range between $2.8 and $2.9 in the past seven days. Although it lost the $3 support level as August came to a close, XRP has managed to hold above $2.8 since then, and this level has so far cushioned it from deeper losses. On the upside, the $3.10 level is the critical resistance to watch. A decisive break above that barrier could shift momentum back in favor of the bulls. Until then, XRP’s price is likely to continue consolidating between $3.10 and $2.8. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.82.

Title: 6 Small Cap Dividends With Super-Sized Yields Of Up To 19%
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/brettowens/2025/09/07/6-small-cap-dividends-with-super-sized-yields-of-up-to-19/

ByBrett Owens, Contributor. Small companies are sneaky AI-friendly plays because they are implementing these tools faster than their larger competitors. Expect to see these smaller firms become more efficient in the quarters ahead. Sales will continue to increase while headcounts will remain relatively flat as robots take up the slack—a boon to future profits. Ironically, small caps are currently the cheapest sector on the board: So, we turn our attention to a six pack of small but mighty dividend payers. Let’s start with a lender that yields “only” 15.7% per year and work our way up from there. We discussed BlackRock TCP Capital (TCPC, 15.7% yield) recently as part of our “unloved stocks” focus. This business development company (BDC) invests in more than 150 companies across 20 industries, with a penchant for first-lien debt. It really began underperforming with gusto in 2023; it’s currently restructuring deals amid portfolio credit issues, so things don’t look much better now. But TCPC’s woes have opened up a wide 18% discount to its net asset value (NAV)—that and a 14% regular yield (with an additional 1.7% from specials) might tempt some distressed-asset buyers. That said, the vast majority of BDCs trade for less than their NAV right now, and most of them sit in the small-cap space, so perhaps there’s more fertile ground elsewhere. For instance, New Mountain Finance (NMFC, 12.1% yield) offers a double-digit yield and a double-digit discount to NAV (14%). NMFC deals in U.S. upper-middle-market businesses backed by private equity sponsors. First-lien debt is its most common deal type, at 65% of the portfolio currently, but it has positions in second lien and subordinated debt, preferred stock, common stock and net lease deals. Its portfolio is 124 companies wide right now, and it uses a “defensive growth” strategy, with a focus on investing in strong businesses in acyclical sectors. New Mountain bounced off the COVID bear-market bottom much like other BDCs. But when the industry caught a second wind in 2024, NMFC was largely left behind. Shares are down about 3% even after accounting for its massive yield, which helps to explain its wide discount to NAV. The problem is that NAV is declining too, including a big quarter-over-quarter dip of nearly 2% between the first and second quarters. NMFC suffered from markdowns on healthcare, consumer products, and ed-tech firm Edmentum. On the bright side, non-accruals (loans that are delinquent for a prolonged period, usually 90 days) were stable, and its credit quality remains in decent shape. Moreover, the company has fee waivers and a dividend protection program to keep the high payout in place. But for that discount to NAV to be a bona fide deal, we’ll need to see better business performance. Kayne Anderson BDC (KBDC, 12.6% yield) is another BDC operating in the middle-market with a penchant for private equity-backed, first-lien loans. KBDC targets companies with between $10 million and $75 million in EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization), and its 114 portfolio companies are largely concentrated in defensive, stable industries. This is an extremely fresh-faced BDC: It began operations in 2021 and went public in 2024. And while it has hardly come roaring out of the gate—its lifetime total return is 1 percentage point removed from the VanEck BDC Income ETF (BIZD)—there are signs of a decent business here. Are there weaknesses? Yes. One small loan was added to the non-accrual list during Q2, bringing non-accruals to 2.2% of the total portfolio on a cost basis (up from 1.9% in Q1). And NAV declined by just less than 1%. But the company’s investments have been picking up in Q3, including a strategic $80 million investment into lower-middle-market credit manager SG Credit at an 11% cash fixed yield. It’s running a $100 million buyback program through May 2026. And part of the aforementioned NAV decline was a 10-cent special dividend—its third in as many quarters. (KBDC yields 10% based on its 40-cent-per-share regular quarterly dividend; specials bring that up to 12.6%.) Mach Natural Resources LP (MNR, 16.0% distribution) is in another big-income niche: master limited partnerships (MLPs). While they can be a pain come tax time because of their additional K-1 form, double-digit distributions can make them worth our time. MNR is a young MLP that formed in November 2017 and went public in late 2023. Its primary operations are in the Anadarko Basin, and it has additional assets in the Green River basin. More recently, it has expanded its reach to the San Juan and Permian basins. While many of its peers are oil-heavy, it has a higher natural-gas mix that in the most recent quarter represented just over half its production. It’s also an efficient operator and has a good track record of buying assets at low valuations. MLP valuations get far into the weeds, but a common-enough one is EV (enterprise value)/EBITDAX (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and exploration expense). On that front, MNR trades at roughly 3.5 times this year’s EBITDAX estimates, which is a little more than half of the average among comparable MLPs. Just understand that while the distribution is sky-high, it’s also all over the place. That’s because MNR pays out variable distributions, which are based on cash available after its 50% reinvestment rate. MFA Financial (MFA, 14.4% yield) invests in residential mortgage loans, residential mortgage-backed securities (MBSs), and other real estate assets. It also originates and services business purpose loans (BPLs) through its Lima One Capital subsidiary. MFA has massively outperformed the mREIT industry throughout its publicly traded life, though shareholders are best advised to wear their seatbelts—it speed-runs peaks and valleys alike. Lima One, which MFA acquired in 2021, is heading in the right direction; Q2 origination, servicing and other fees were up 13% QoQ, and the subsidiary added 15 loan officers during the quarter. Delinquency trends aren’t nearly so clean-cut: In Q2, they declined on the residential whole loan portfolio and single-family rental loans, but increased in the single-family BPL portfolio. Distributable earnings (DE, a non-GAAP measure of profitability that MFA favors) are expected to drop significantly this year before rebounding in 2026. Until then, the dividend is expected to outpace DE—that’s hardly a comfortable position. On the flip side? The market doesn’t appear to be pricing in a cut, and in fact, MFA actually raised its dividend by about 3% earlier this year—its first hike since a 20% cut in 2022. But MFA is value-priced, at about 7 times 2026 earnings estimates and 73% of book. We can get a downright jaw-dropping dividend from Armour Residential REIT (ARR, 19.0% yield), which primarily invests in fixed-rate “agency” residential MBSs, which are those issued or guaranteed by government-sponsored entities such as Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, or Ginnie Mae. The value picture is a bit different from MFA, but it’s still cheap—ARR trades at about 90% of book, but also at just more than 4 times 2026 core EPS estimates. The question is: How deep must the discount be to ignore Armour’s past? Consider this: In December 2024, I wrote that “any prospective investors will have to overcome a significant mental hurdle: namely, Armour’s horrific dividend track record.” Armour has cut its payout seven times since 2015, and that reflects serious underperformance compared to the mREIT industry. It has continued to underperform since then, but it really detached from the mREIT group in August following a second-quarter miss on distributable EPS and net interest income. Book value per share dropped by 9%. If there’s any solace, it’s that the nearly 20% dividend remains well-covered. But even with that mammoth dividend, ARR has been historically incapable of delivering consistent positive total returns. Brett Owens is Chief Investment Strategist for Contrarian Outlook.

Title: Take the nuclear option: Let Mamdani win the mayoral race so NYC can start over from scratch

As alarm bells ring over the New York City mayoral race, an odd sentiment is starting to gain traction across the business community: Just give up. Just sit tight and let the ill-equipped Maoist Zohran Mamdani win in November. Let him unleash his creepy, dogmatic socialist policies on the masses to teach them valuable lessons — both economic and cultural — about wokeness and progressivism, and more broadly its stranglehold on the Democratic Party. I’m starting to agree. Let the city sink into the abyss. Let Mamdani’s policies force out business and prod more upper- and middle-class residents to flee. Let the city declare bankruptcy — which will happen if Mamdani gets his way. We can then start from scratch. Detroit did it and the last time I was there, its downtown was pristine. Plus, we’re headed there anyway, right? Why not expedite the process and teach people who think leftism works that it doesn’t — particularly when you chase out all the non-leftists who pay the bills. To be clear, New York City isn’t Detroit. Sure, there’s diversification, businesses moving operations to Texas and Florida, but for all the work-from-home doom-and-gloom talk about New York City real estate, Jamie Dimon’s JPMorgan is still headquartered in Midtown. Goldman Sachs remains on the West Side. BlackRock, the world’s largest money manager, is in Hudson Yards. NYU Langone is here, built through the grit of legendary financier Ken Langone, with world prestige and a quality of care to match. (I can personally attest to the latter.) The best restaurants are here: Try getting a table at ­Elio’s, Sistina or Rao’s. It’s still a cultural mecca, the home of Broadway, The Met and some great museums. For all our issues, New York City with a GDP of around $1.3 trillion has an economy bigger than many countries. We are also saddled, of course, with an insane political class. Zohran Mamdani might be honest in his Marxism, maybe boyishly naive in explaining the benefits of government-run grocery stores that have failed everywhere they were tried. (See most recently Kansas City.) But in this state, he is no outlier. He is emblematic of one-party rule, a fellow traveler in New York’s leftist Democratic Party that has brainwashed voters into believing we need massive regulation that impedes business formation. Ditto for rent control that creates housing shortages, lax policing (do you really feel safe on the streets of Manhattan, particularly at night?), high taxes (the reason so many people are leaving) and a fracking ban that continues to deprive economically depressed upstate regions. Dems have ditched New York’s melting pot in favor of woke and hostile tribalism. The largest concentration of Jews outside Israel, right here in New York City, must now accept daily harassment over leftists’ warped interpretation of history. And we must embrace ­unions, like the clown car that runs the school system. Consider: Sleepy Joe Biden’s immigration policies opened the floodgates for millions of migrants to come to this country.

Never miss a story. Many settled here in New York City, were housed in fancy hotels, and yet since 2020 NYC has witnessed a net out-migration of around 400,000 people. Put another way, a city’s worth of taxpayers left and was replaced by the world’s poor who are tapping into the city’s generous welfare state. Operationally, Andrew Cuomo could be a good mayor. He knows how to run things on both the state and national level. Yet consider his ill-fated last years as governor: He was forced to cave to the left on every issue, banned fracking, raised taxes and couldn’t tame the size of government. Could Eric Adams stand up to those clowns if he were to win — and not drop out as people now believe he will? He hasn’t so far. Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa, the crime-fighting activist founder of the Guardian Angels, is tough as nails and, when you sit with him, very coherent on policy. Yet if through a stroke of divine intervention he were to be elected, he would be outnumbered 1,000 to 1. He needs the state Legislature to create reform on taxes and other issues, and that’s where the mini-Mamdanis reside. There and the New York City Council, which is a mini-politburo. That’s why I am now leaning ­toward the nuclear option. Let Mamdani win — and prove to New Yorkers and Americans once and for all that there’s a reason communism failed in the Soviet Union, and that the apparatchiks in China have embraced the free market to survive.
